<text>Michael Corleone is a fictional character and the protagonist of Mario Puzo&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;. In the three &quot;Godfather&quot; films, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Michael was portrayed by Al Pacino, for which he was twice-nominated for Academy Awards. Michael is the youngest son of Vito Corleone, a Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia empire. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Michael succeeds him as the don of the Corleone crime family.

In June 2003, Michael Corleone was recognized as the 11th most iconic villain in film history by the American Film Institute, although some critics consider him to be a tragic hero. The British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; selected Michael Corleone as the 11th greatest movie character, with Pacino&#x27;s performance as Michael Corleone widely regarded as one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.

== Family ==
Born on March 23, 1920, to Mafia don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his wife Carmela (Morgana King), Michael has two older brothers, Santino &quot;Sonny&quot; Corleone (James Caan) and Frederico &quot;Fredo&quot; Corleone (John Cazale), and a younger sister, Constanzia &quot;Connie&quot; Corleone (Talia Shire). The family &quot;consigliere&quot;, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), is their informal adopted brother.
== &quot;The Godfather&quot; ==
In his novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Mario Puzo introduces Michael with the following physical description: &quot;He did not have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of [his siblings], and his jet black hair was straight rather than curly. His skin was a clear olive-brown that would have been called beautiful in a girl. He was handsome in a delicate way.&quot; Later in the novel, Puzo writes, &quot;Michael was not tall or heavily built but his presence seemed to radiate danger.&quot;

Michael initially wanted nothing to do with the Corleone &quot;family business&quot;, and enrolled at Dartmouth College in order to escape any potential involvement in crime. In truth, his father never wanted Michael to be involved in the family&#x27;s criminal enterprise and actually hoped he&#x27;d go into politics. After the United States&#x27; entry into World War II in 1941, he enlisted in the Marines (training under Sergeant Bradshaw) and fought in the Pacific, even though his father had expended great effort to wrangle a deferment for him. For his bravery in battle, Michael was awarded the Navy Cross, and was also featured in Life magazine in 1944. Michael was discharged as a Captain to recover from wounds- along with friend Hank Vogelsong in 1945. However, unbeknownst to Michael, the doctor treating him had been bribed by his father to exaggerate his injury in order to send him home.

During the waning weeks of Summer 1945, Michael is discharged from the Marines, unaware that Vito secretly arranged for his discharge, using his political influence. Michael returns home to attend his sister Connie&#x27;s wedding at the end of August accompanied by Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), his college sweetheart. Michael stays for a few weeks, intending to re-enter college without telling his family.

Just before Christmas 1945, Vito is critically wounded in an assassination attempt by drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), pushing a reluctant Michael into the Mafia world he has avoided for so long. Arriving at the hospital, he finds his bedridden father unprotected from potential attack. While awaiting Corleone reinforcements, Michael prevents a second assassination attempt on Vito by Sollozzo, then affirms his loyalty to his father. Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a corrupt NYPD captain on Sollozzo&#x27;s payroll, breaks Michael&#x27;s jaw before more Corleone button men arrive.

As Vito Corleone recuperates, Sollozzo requests that Michael broker a truce, but acting boss Sonny, suspecting a trap, refuses and demands the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Michael volunteers to meet Sollozzo in a public place and kill him and McCluskey. Hagen warns that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill police officers, and says it would incite deadly backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement. Michael argues they can publicly expose McCluskey as a corrupt cop involved in the drug trade and serving as Sollozzo&#x27;s bodyguard, contending that McCluskey has crossed into their world and is fair game. Sonny agrees and approves the hit.

After careful preparation, Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in The Bronx. He retrieves a handgun that Corleone &quot;caporegime&quot; Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) had planted beforehand in the bathroom and kills Sollozzo, with one shot to the forehead, and then McCluskey, one in the neck followed by one in the forehead, all at point-blank range. This ignites the New York underworld&#x27;s first Mafia war in a decade.

Michael escapes to Sicily and spends two years under Corleone ally Don Tommasino&#x27;s (Corrado Gaipa) protection. Michael falls in love with and marries a young local woman named Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli). Back in the United States, Sonny is murdered. After Michael is notified of Sonny&#x27;s murder, he and Apollonia prepare to move to Siracusa, but she is killed by a car bomb meant for Michael, proving the other Mafia families know where he is hiding.

Michael returns to the United States in 1950 and assumes Sonny&#x27;s role as Vito&#x27;s heir apparent. After Vito&#x27;s suspicions are confirmed that Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), his main rival in New York City, is the mastermind of his shooting and Sonny&#x27;s murder, he and Michael begin a secret, complex plot to wipe out the other New York Dons. They deliberately allow their rivals to whittle away at Corleone interests to lull them into inaction. Meanwhile, Michael convinces his father that it is time to remove the family from crime. More than a year following his return, Michael reunites with Kay and they marry. He promises her the Corleone family will be completely legitimate in five years. Within three years, they have two children, Anthony and Mary.

Vito semi-retires in 1954, and Michael becomes operating head of the family. He offers to buy out casino owner Moe Greene&#x27;s (Alex Rocco) stake in the Las Vegas casino that the Corleones bankrolled, intending to move the family to Nevada as part of his effort to legitimize the Corleone interests; Greene refuses to sell. Corleone family &quot;caporegimes&quot; Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) and Clemenza request permission to begin operating their own families in Corleone territory. Michael, with Vito&#x27;s support, advises them to be patient and wait until the move to Las Vegas is completed. Tessio and Clemenza agree, but are clearly dissatisfied.

A few years after the move to Nevada, Michael, now in his mid-thirties, named Clemenza as consigliere and head of the family&#x27;s New York operations. Clemenza died of a supposed heart attack, and was replaced by longtime family friend and soldier Frank Pentangeli.

Although he is now firmly entrenched as the most powerful crime boss in the nation, he steps up his efforts to make the Corleone family legitimate. For instance, he buys a construction company and several other businesses in an effort to lead a more normal life. However, his efforts at redeeming the family were largely unsuccessful, as his many enemies kept him involved in the underworld.

He begins working out a deal with Hyman Roth, a longtime business partner of the family as well as a rival, over control of casino operations. Unknown to Michael, Roth was actually maneuvering to have Michael killed in revenge for the death of Moe Greene, his longtime friend. Roth manipulated Michael&#x27;s brother Fredo into unwittingly providing him with information used to arrange an attempt on Michael&#x27;s life, which nearly succeeds. Roth also attempted to murder Pentangeli, while making him think that Michael was to blame.

In 1955, Vito warns Michael that Barzini will likely attempt to assassinate Michael under the pretense of negotiating peace between the families, using a disloyal contact within the Corleone regime. Whoever approaches Michael about the meeting, Vito explains, will be the traitor within the family. Shortly thereafter, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his tomato garden.

At Vito&#x27;s funeral, Tessio tells Michael that Barzini wants to arrange a meeting, confirming Vito&#x27;s prediction. Michael sets his plan in motion to murder the other New York Mafia heads: Barzini, Philip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), Carmine Cuneo (Rudy Bond), and Victor Stracci (Don Costello), as well as Greene. The plot unfolds on the same day Michael stands as godfather to Connie&#x27;s newborn son, Michael Francis Rizzi. Later the same day, he has Tessio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie&#x27;s abusive husband who conspired in Sonny&#x27;s murder, executed. In one stroke, Michael re-establishes the Corleone family as the nation&#x27;s most powerful crime family and establishes a reputation as being even more cunning and ruthless than his father.

A few days later, Connie furiously accuses Michael of murdering Carlo. When challenged by Kay, Michael denies having ordered Carlo&#x27;s murder. Kay, initially believing Michael, later observes him receiving his &quot;capos&quot;. Clemenza addresses Michael as &quot;Don Corleone&quot; and kisses his hand in the same manner that he did with Michael&#x27;s father. Kay realizes Connie&#x27;s accusations were true, and that Michael has become a powerful Don becoming his father&#x27;s successor in every way. In the novel, Kay leaves Michael, but Hagen persuades her to return.

== &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; ==
&quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is set in 1958 and 1959. The Corleone family has relocated to Nevada, while &quot;capo&quot; Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) runs the family&#x27;s operations in New York, Clemenza having died a few years before. While Michael&#x27;s many enemies and growing obsession with revenge keep him tethered to the criminal underworld, he still plans to finally legitimize the family by negotiating with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), his father&#x27;s former business partner, over controlling casino operations in Cuba.

Hours after Anthony&#x27;s First Communion party, assassins open fire on the Corleone house, nearly killing Michael and Kay. Michael suspects Roth ordered the hit, and believes a mole within the Corleone family aided him. To uncover Roth&#x27;s involvement, Michael maintains their business relationship, and orders Pentangeli to settle a dispute with Roth&#x27;s business partners, the Rosato Brothers. When Pentangeli meets with them, they try to kill him, but he survives.

Michael, Roth, and Fredo travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista allowing them to operate casinos in Cuba without interference in exchange for generous payments to the Cuban government. Michael sends his bodyguard to eliminate Roth on New Year&#x27;s Eve, but Cuban soldiers kill the bodyguard during the attempt. That same night, Fredo unintentionally reveals that he was the mole within the family; Michael confronts Fredo and gives him the Sicilian &quot;kiss of death&quot;. During the New Year&#x27;s Eve festivities, victorious rebel forces enter Havana, forcing Batista into exile and ruining Michael&#x27;s plans. Fredo, afraid of his brother, runs off, while Roth escapes to Miami.

Meanwhile, Pentangeli, believing Michael had ordered a hit on him, prepares to testify against him in the Senate&#x27;s investigation of organized crime. However, Michael has Pentangeli&#x27;s brother Vincenzo (Salvatore Po) brought from Sicily. Just prior to the hearing, Vincenzo and Frank exchange glances. Understanding the threat, Pentangeli recants his earlier sworn statements, throwing the hearings into chaos and effectively destroying the government&#x27;s case against Michael.

Fredo confesses to Michael that Roth&#x27;s right-hand man, Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), had promised to reward him for information about Michael. Fredo also says that he resents being &quot;passed over&quot; to head the family in favor of Michael, and that he withheld key information about the Senate investigation. Michael disowns Fredo and tells his personal assassin Al Neri (Richard Bright) that nothing is to happen to his brother while their mother is alive — the implication being that Neri is to kill Fredo after she dies.

Meanwhile, Kay decides to leave Michael and take their children with her, believing Michael will always live in a world of crime and violence. Michael asks her to reconsider, but Kay reveals she aborted their unborn son because she refused to bring another of his children into the world. Enraged, Michael hits Kay in the face and severs ties with her, taking custody of Anthony and Mary.

Following their mother&#x27;s death, and at Connie&#x27;s behest, Michael seemingly forgives Fredo, but it is actually a ploy to draw him in closer in order to have him killed. Soon after, Neri murders Fredo on Michael&#x27;s orders. At the same time, Michael sends Hagen to persuade Pentangeli to commit suicide to spare his family, and has &quot;caporegime&quot; Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui) kill a heavily guarded Roth at Idlewild Airport upon his return to the US.

The film ends as Michael recalls a surprise birthday party for his father on December 7, 1941. In a flashback scene, Michael informs the family that he has dropped out of college to enlist in the Marines. Only Fredo supports Michael&#x27;s decision. When Vito arrives off-screen, everyone goes to greet him except Michael, who sits alone. The film closes with Michael sitting alone in the Corleones&#x27; Lake Tahoe compound.

== &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; ==
&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; is set in 1979 and 1980. Michael has moved back to New York, abandoned the Nevada estate, and taken great strides to remove the family from crime.

He turns over his New York criminal interests to longtime enforcer Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna). Ridden with guilt over his ruthless rise to power, particularly his order to kill Fredo, Michael uses his great wealth to rehabilitate his reputation through numerous acts of charity, administered by a foundation named after his father.

A decade earlier, he had given custody of his two children to Kay, who has since remarried. He sells his gambling interests to other Mafia families and reorganizes his vast legitimate business holdings as the &quot;Corleone Group&quot;.

The Holy See has named him a Commander of the Order of Saint Sebastian for his charitable works and large donations to Catholic institutions.

At the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion after nine years. Kay supports their son Anthony&#x27;s (Franc D&#x27;Ambrosio) ambition to reject the &quot;family business&quot; and become an opera singer, and tells Michael that both she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo&#x27;s death. Michael had previously wanted Anthony to either finish law school or join the family business, but now consents to Anthony going his own way.

Michael&#x27;s new connection to the Church provides an opportunity to take over the large property company, Immobiliare. He is already its largest shareholder, and offers to buy the Vatican&#x27;s 25 percent share, which will give him controlling interest. He also takes in Sonny&#x27;s illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), a soldier in Zasa&#x27;s crew, as his protégé. Nevertheless, Michael is distressed by Vincent&#x27;s fiery temper, and disapproves of his romance with Michael&#x27;s daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola).

On the night Michael announces he is dissolving his gambling empire, Zasa wipes out most of The Commission in a helicopter attack in Atlantic City. Michael escapes with help from Vincent and Neri. Michael realizes that his old friend Don Altobello (Eli Wallach) is the brains behind the attempt on his life. Traumatized by the attack, Michael suffers a diabetic stroke, briefly incapacitating him. (Francis Ford Coppola reveals in his audio commentary that Michael is frequently seen drinking water in the first two films—subtle hints that he is a diabetic.) 

With Michael still bedridden, Connie gives Vincent consent to assassinate Zasa. Disguised as an NYPD mounted officer, Vincent kills Zasa in the middle of an Italian street festival. Michael is infuriated upon learning of the hit, and demands that no similar orders be issued while he is alive.

Michael returns to Sicily for Anthony&#x27;s operatic debut at the Teatro Massimo. Suspecting that Altobello may make another attempt on his life, he has Vincent infiltrate Altobello&#x27;s &quot;regime&quot; under the pretense of defecting.

Michael and Kay tour Sicily together, during which Michael asks for Kay&#x27;s forgiveness. Kay admits she will always love him, and they begin to rekindle their relationship.

Meanwhile, the Immobiliare deal has stalled, supposedly because the critically ill Pope Paul VI must personally approve it. Michael learns that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle concocted by Immobiliare chairman Licio Lucchesi (Enzo Robutti), who schemed with Vatican Bank head Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly) and accountant Frederick Keinszig (Helmut Berger) to embezzle a fortune from the Vatican Bank, using Michael&#x27;s &quot;investment&quot; to cover their tracks. Hoping to salvage the deal, Michael seeks Don Tommasino&#x27;s assistance. He directs Michael to Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), the future Pope John Paul I. With Lamberto&#x27;s prodding, Michael makes his first confession in 30 years, tearfully breaking down as he admits to ordering Fredo&#x27;s murder. Lamberto tells Michael he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, but that there is hope for his redemption.

John Paul I dies soon after being elected pope, poisoned by Gilday. Michael learns that Altobello (in league with the conspirators) has hired an assassin named Mosca (Mario Donatone) to kill him. Mosca murders Tommasino, and Michael vows before his old friend&#x27;s casket to sin no more. Vincent reports that Lucchesi, working with Altobello, is behind the assassination attempts on Michael.

Weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, Michael retires, making Vincent his successor, but not before giving him permission to retaliate. In return, Vincent agrees to end his relationship with Mary. That night, Michael, reconciled with Kay and Anthony, watches his son&#x27;s performance in the opera &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;. Meanwhile, Vincent has Lucchesi, Gilday, and Keinszig murdered, while Connie murders Altobello with a poisoned cannoli.

After the performance, Mosca shoots Michael, wounding him, and a second bullet hits Mary, killing her. Mary&#x27;s death breaks Michael&#x27;s spirit, and he screams in agony over her body. In an epilogue scene set in 1997, an elderly Michael dies alone in the same courtyard where he married Apollonia.

In the December 2020 release of &quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, Coppola&#x27;s canonical recut of the third film, the final scene is re-edited to portray Michael sitting alone in the courtyard without showing his death.

== &quot;The Sicilian&quot; ==
Michael is a secondary character in Puzo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, which takes place during his first exile in Sicily. He learns from Clemenza about the legendary exploits of the novel&#x27;s main character, Salvatore Guiliano (In the novel, the spelling of Salvatore Giuliano&#x27;s name was intentionally changed by Puzo to &quot;Guiliano&quot;.), and is eager to meet him, but Giuliano is murdered before the meeting can take place.

==Sequel novels==
Michael appears in Mark Winegardner&#x27;s sequel novels &quot;The Godfather Returns&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In &quot;Godfather Returns&quot;, set roughly during the time of &quot;Godfather Part II&quot;, Michael battles with a new rival, disgruntled Corleone &quot;capo&quot; Nick Geraci, while attempting to legitimize the family. In &quot;The Godfather&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, set a few years after the second film, he moves to protect his criminal empire against Geraci and the machinations of a powerful political dynasty, while dealing with the collapse of his marriage and his guilt over having Fredo murdered. In the latter novel, he has a relationship with actress Marguerite &quot;Rita&quot; Duvall in the early 1960s, but he ends it upon realizing that he is still in love with Kay.

<doc id="550071" wikidata="Q58030" url="?curid=550071" title="Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)">
<text>Heinrich Müller (28 April 1900; date of death unknown, but evidence points to May 1945) was a high-ranking German &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and police official during the Nazi era. For most of World War II in Europe, he was the chief of the Gestapo, the secret state police of Nazi Germany. Müller was central in the planning and execution of the Holocaust and attended the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, which formalised plans for deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe—The &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish question&quot;. He was known as &quot;Gestapo Müller&quot; to distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich Müller.

He was last seen in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; in Berlin on 1 May 1945 and remains the most senior figure of the Nazi regime who was never captured or confirmed to have died.

==Early life and career==
Müller was born in Munich on 28 April 1900 to Catholic parents. His father had been a rural police official. Müller attended a &quot;Volksschule&quot; and completed an apprenticeship as an aircraft mechanic before the outbreak of the First World War. During the last year of the war, he served in the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; as a pilot for an artillery spotting unit. He was decorated several times for bravery (including the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class, Bavarian Military Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords and Bavarian Pilots Badge). After the war ended, he joined the Bavarian Police in 1919 as an auxiliary worker. Although not a member of the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, he was involved in the suppression of the communist risings in the early post-war years. After witnessing the shooting of hostages by the revolutionary &quot;Red Army&quot; in Munich during the Bavarian Soviet Republic, he acquired a lifelong hatred of communism. During the years of the Weimar Republic he was head of the Munich Political Police Department, having risen quickly through the ranks due to his spirited efforts.

==SS career==
It was while serving in a police capacity in Munich that Müller first became acquainted with many members of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) including Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, although during the Weimar period he supported the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party. On 9 March 1933, during the Nazi &quot;putsch&quot; that deposed the Bavarian government of Minister-President Heinrich Held, Müller advocated using force against the Nazis to his superiors. Ironically, these views aided Müller&#x27;s rise as it guaranteed the hostility of the Nazis, thereby making Müller very dependent upon the patronage of Reinhard Heydrich, who in turn appreciated Müller&#x27;s professionalism and skill as a policeman, and was aware of Müller&#x27;s past. Once the Nazis seized power, Müller&#x27;s knowledge of communist activities placed him in high demand; as a result he was promoted to &quot;Polizeiobersekretär&quot; in May 1933 and again to Criminal Inspector in November 1933.

Historian Richard J. Evans wrote: &quot;Müller was a stickler for duty and discipline, and approached the tasks he was set as if they were military commands. A true workaholic who never took a vacation, Müller was determined to serve the German state, irrespective of what political form it took, and believed it was everyone&#x27;s duty, including his own, to obey its dictates without question.&quot; Evans also records Müller was a regime functionary out of ambition, not out of a belief in National Socialism: An internal [Nazi] Party memorandum ... could not understand how &quot;so odious an opponent of the movement&quot; could become head of the Gestapo, especially since he had once referred to Hitler as &quot;an immigrant unemployed house painter&quot; and &quot;an Austrian draft-dodger&quot;. Nazi jurist and former police chief, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Werner Best opined Müller represented one of the &quot;finest examples&quot; of the limited connection between members of the NSDAP and the police before 1933.

After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Heydrich, as head of the Security Service (SD), recruited Müller, Franz Josef Huber and Josef Albert Meisinger, who were collectively referred to as the &quot;Bajuwaren-Brigade&quot; (Bavarian Brigade). Müller joined the SS in 1934. By 1936, with Heydrich head of the Gestapo, Müller was its operations chief.

On 4 January 1937, an evaluation by the Nazi Party&#x27;s Deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Munich-Upper Bavaria stated:

This assessment did not deter Heydrich from moving Müller along the ranks, particularly since Heydrich believed it was an advantage not to be bound to the influence of the Nazi Party. Functionaries like Müller were the sort of men Heydrich preferred since they were inherently committed to their &quot;area of responsibility&quot; and correspondingly justified any steps they deemed necessary against perceived enemies of the Nazi &quot;racial community.&quot; Müller was promoted to the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot; (colonel) in 1937. Engrossing himself often in red-tape and statistics, Müller was a natural administrator who took solace in a &quot;world of notes, memos, and regulations&quot; and then received and transformed Gestapo reports of denouncements, torture, and secret executions into &quot;administrative fodder.&quot; Despite the expense of so much mental energy in carrying out his duties, Müller disliked the scholarly types and once told Walter Schellenberg that &quot;intellectuals should be sent down a coal mine and blown up.&quot;

British author and translator Edward Crankshaw described Müller as &quot;the arch-type non-political functionary&quot; who was &quot;in love with personal power and dedicated to the service of authority, the State.&quot; General Walter Dornberger, the chief over the rocket research at Peenemünde, (under alleged Gestapo suspicion) was one of the few to ever interview with Müller and characterized him as, &quot;the unobtrusive type of police official who leaves no personal impression on the memory&quot; but added, &quot;... all I could remember was a pair of piercing grey-blue eyes, fixed on me with an unwavering scrutiny. My first impression was one of cold curiosity and extreme reserve.&quot; American journalist and war correspondent, William L. Shirer, called Müller a &quot;a dapper-looking fellow&quot; but shortly thereafter described him as &quot;a cold, dispassionate killer&quot;.

Himmler biographer Peter Padfield wrote: &quot;he [Müller] was an archetypal middle rank official: of limited imagination, non-political, non-ideological, his only fanaticism lay in an inner drive to perfection in his profession and in his duty to the state—which in his mind were one ... A smallish man with piercing eyes and thin lips, he was an able organiser, utterly ruthless, a man who lived for his work.&quot; Such was his dedication to the job that Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Höss claimed one could reach Müller &quot;any time of the day or night, even Sundays and public holidays.&quot;

He was made Inspector of the Security Police for all of Austria following the 1938 Anschluss, while his close friend Franz Josef Huber took charge of the Gestapo office in Vienna. One of Müller&#x27;s first major acts occurred during the unprecedented &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom of 9–10 November 1938, when he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 30,000 Jews. Heydrich also tasked Müller during the summer of 1939 to create a centrally organized agency to deal with the eventual emigration of the Jews. Müller became a member of the Nazi Party in 1939 for the purely opportunist reason of improving his chances of promotion and only after Himmler insisted he do it. Historian Robert Gellately does not give much credence to this apolitical image of Müller and cites the musings of Walter Schellenberg, who claimed during a conversation with Müller sometime in 1943, Müller lauded the Stalinist system as superior to Nazism, which he believed compromised on too much. Schellenberg even alleged when Müller compared Stalin against Hitler, his (Müller&#x27;s) opinion was Stalin did things better. As Gellately relates, such a politically oriented asseveration certainly indicates Müller did indeed have preferences. He was notorious, for instance, for admiring the Soviet police.

While the chief of the subsequent Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration was indeed Heydrich, it was Müller who took care of the office&#x27;s administrative details. Shortly thereafter, Müller took charge of this office but then handed control over to Adolf Eichmann. Once the war began, this ended the possibility of Jewish emigration and caused the office&#x27;s dissolution.

==Gestapo chief==
In September 1939, when the Gestapo and other police organizations were consolidated under Heydrich into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), Müller was made chief of the RSHA &quot;Amt IV&quot; (Office or Dept. 4): Gestapo. To distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich Müller, he became known as &quot;Gestapo Müller&quot;.

As Gestapo chief of operations and later (September 1939 forward) head of the organization, Müller played a leading role in the detection and suppression of all forms of resistance to the Nazi regime. Trusted by both Heydrich and Himmler, Müller was pivotal in making the Gestapo the &quot;central executive organ of National Socialist terror&quot; according to historians Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle. Under his leadership, the Gestapo succeeded in infiltrating and to a large extent, destroying groups opposed to the Nazis, such as the underground networks of the left-wing Social Democratic Party and Communist Party. Along these lines, historian George C. Browder asserts that Müller&#x27;s &quot;expertise and his ardent hate for Communism guaranteed his future&quot;.

When Hitler and his army chiefs asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Müller masterminded and carried out a false flag project code-named Operation Himmler. During one of the operations, the clandestine mission to a German radio station on the Polish border, Müller helped collect a dozen or so condemned men from camps, who were then dressed in Polish uniforms. In exchange for their participation, the men were told by Müller that &quot;they would be pardoned and released.&quot; Instead, the men were given a lethal injection and gunshot wounds to make them appear to have been killed in action during a fake attack. These incidents (particularly the staged attack on the Gleiwitz radio station) were then used in Nazi propaganda to justify the invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II.

Thereafter, Müller continued to rise quickly through the ranks of the SS: in October 1939 he became an SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;, in November 1941 – &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; and Lieutenant General of the police. During the Second World War, Müller was heavily involved in espionage and counter-espionage, particularly since the Nazi regime increasingly distrusted the military intelligence service—the &quot;Abwehr&quot;—which under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris was a hotbed of activity for the German Resistance. In 1942 he successfully infiltrated the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot; network of Soviet spies and used it to feed false information to the Soviet intelligence services.

Heydrich was Müller&#x27;s direct superior until his assassination in 1942. For the remainder of the war, Ernst Kaltenbrunner took over as Müller&#x27;s superior. Müller occupied a position in the Nazi hierarchy close to Himmler, the overall head of the Nazi police apparatus and the chief architect of the plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe, and Eichmann, the man entrusted with arranging the deportations of Jews to the Eastern ghettoes and death camps. Eichmann headed the Gestapo&#x27;s &quot;Office of Resettlement&quot;, and then its &quot;Office of Jewish Affairs&quot; (the RSHA Amt IV sub-section known as Referat IV B4). He was Müller&#x27;s subordinate. Müller was also involved in the regime&#x27;s policy towards the Jews, although Himmler and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels drove this area of policy. On 6 October 1939 for instance, Müller instructed Eichmann to prepare for the deportation of some 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from the annexed Polish city of Kattowitz; an order which included the deportation of the Jews from Ostrava—both &quot;expulsion campaigns&quot; had already been planned as early as September by the Gestapo or the army. Twelve days later on 18 October 1939, he told Eichmann it would soon &quot;be necessary to organize the resettlement and removal of Poles and Jews into the area of the future Polish rump state centrally&quot; via the RSHA.

Although his chief responsibility was always police work within Germany, he was fully in charge and thus responsible to execute the extermination of the Jews of Europe. When Eichmann reported to Müller sometime in the middle of 1941 that he had been informed by Himmler the Führer had ordered the physical destruction of the Jews for instance, Müller silently nodded at his desk, indicating to Eichmann that he already knew. Correspondingly, Müller received detailed reports from Eichmann about the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; death-squad units, which according to historian Raul Hilberg killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews between 1941 and 1945. At the end of June 1941, Müller dispatched Eichmann to Minsk, so he could collect detailed information on the execution activities. In August 1941, Müller ordered these killing reports be forwarded to Hitler. Attempting to keep the brutality of the wholesale slaughter occurring in the East as quiet as possible, Müller sent a telegram to the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; towards the end of August 1941, which explicitly instructed them &quot;to prevent the crowding of spectators during the mass executions.&quot; On 23 October 1941, Müller briefed a circular to SiPo stations which exclusively prohibited any future Jewish emigration out of German controlled territory, a directive which presaged their imminent extermination.

In January 1942, he attended the Wannsee Conference at which Heydrich briefed senior officials from a number of government departments of the extermination plan, and at which Eichmann took the minutes. Once the conference concluded, Müller, Heydrich, and Eichmann remained afterwards for additional &quot;informal chats&quot;. Just a couple of months later in March 1942, Jews were already being systematically killed in gas vans at Chelmno and Belzec while construction was underway at Birkenau and Sobibor. Again, Müller sent Eichmann to relate his findings about the killing operations taking place at Chelmno; when Eichmann returned this time, he reported to Müller that the scene was &quot;horrible&quot; and added it was &quot;an indescribable inferno.&quot; When the first denunciations of the mass murder being carried-out by the Germans hit the Allied press during the autumn and winter of 1942, Himmler instructed Müller to ensure &quot;all the bodies were either buried or burned.&quot;

Enforcement and administration of Nazi &quot;racial-hygiene&quot; policies were also within the purview of Müller&#x27;s responsibilities, as a special letter he sent from Berlin to all Gestapo offices on 10 March 1942 reveals; the letter contained instructions concerning the relationship between German women and Polish civilians or prisoners-of-war who were conscripted as labor during the war, particularly in cases related to pregnancy. If both parties proved &quot;racially acceptable&quot; and the Polish man wanted to marry the woman, the pregnancy and relationship was allowed without punitive consequences, provided the RSHA approved after photographic evaluation of both parties and subsequent &quot;Germanization&quot; of the Pole occurred. For cases where one or more parties was deemed racially unfit, the Polish male would receive &quot;special handling&quot;, an obvious Nazi euphemism for a death-sentence.

In May 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in Prague by Czechoslovak soldiers sent from London. Müller was sent to Prague to head the investigation into Operation &quot;Anthropoid&quot;. He succeeded through a combination of bribery and torture in locating the assassins, who killed themselves to avoid capture. Despite this success, his influence within the regime declined somewhat with the loss of his original patron, Heydrich. Nonetheless, between the time Heydrich died in 1942 and Kaltenbrunner took office in January 1943, &quot;Müller played a central role in the organization of The Holocaust.&quot; Evidence of Müller&#x27;s intimate involvement in the Holocaust are abundant in some of the surviving documents and in the later testimony of Eichmann, who divulged that he remained in constant contact with Müller. Eichmann recalled how Müller reserved power unto himself and while he (Eichmann), arranged plenty of deportations, it was only Müller who could write the total number of Jews (in his orange-colored pencil) who were transported at the top of the corresponding reports.

As the Red Army counteroffensive against the Germans arrayed at the Battle of Stalingrad in mid-November 1942 started to take its toll, the exigencies of war demanded an increase in arms production; Müller played his part by responding to and facilitating Himmler&#x27;s request for an additional 35,000–40,000 forced laborers. The Gestapo Chief rounded them up from across detention centers and prisons which were not yet part of the concentration camp system and sent them to Majdanek and Auschwitz. Sometime in 1943, Müller was sent to Rome to pressure Fascist Italy to cooperate in relinquishing their Jews for deportation. Despite having the apparent support of Benito Mussolini, Müller&#x27;s efforts were not very successful as influential Jewish figures within Italy were in contact with the police and the military; they successfully appealed to their (Italians and Jews) shared religious convictions and convinced them to resist Nazi pressure. In 1943 Müller had differences with Himmler over what to do with the growing evidence of a resistance network within the German state apparatus, particularly the &quot;Abwehr&quot; and the Foreign Office. He presented Himmler with firm evidence during February 1943, that Wilhelm Canaris was involved with the resistance; however, Himmler told him to drop the case. Offended by this, Müller became an ally of Martin Bormann, the head of the Nazi Party Chancellery, who was Himmler&#x27;s main rival.

According to the SiPo and SD official in Denmark, Rudolf Mildner, Gestapo Chief Müller instructed him &quot;to arrest the Nobel Prize–winning atomic physicist Niels Bohr&quot; sometime during the fall of 1943; this was likely the consequence of Bohr being half-Jewish, but his scientific significance also interested officials in Berlin. Fortunately for Bohr, he was tipped off by a sympathetic German woman working for the Gestapo and was able to escape across the Kattegat Strait into Sweden with the evacuation of Jews from Denmark. Later, Mildner conveniently asserted during Allied questioning that he had disobeyed Müller&#x27;s order and allowed Bohr to get to safety.

Early in 1944, Müller issued the Nazi injunction known as the &quot;cartridge directive&quot;; this command ordered that Soviet prisoners-of-war who had assisted in the identification of detained political commissars for the purpose of their liquidation be executed on the grounds they were &quot;Geheimnisträger&quot; (bearers of secrets). Instructions like these amid the numerous other crimes committed at his command made Müller &quot;one of the most feared officials in Europe&quot; during the Nazi reign.

After the assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944, Müller was placed in charge of the arrest and interrogation of all those suspected of involvement in the resistance. Over 5,000 people were arrested and about 200 executed, including Canaris. Not long after the anti-Nazi resisters were killed, Müller allegedly exclaimed, &quot;We won&#x27;t make the same mistake as in 1918. We won&#x27;t leave our internal German enemies alive.&quot; In the last months of the war, Müller remained at his post, apparently still confident of a German victory: he told one of his officers in December 1944 that the Ardennes offensive would result in the recapture of Paris.

==Berlin 1945==
In April 1945, Müller was among the last of the Nazi loyalists assembled in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; as the Red Army fought its way into the city centre of Berlin. One of his last tasks was the interrogation of Hermann Fegelein, Himmler&#x27;s SS liaison officer, in the cellar of the Church of the Trinity after Himmler&#x27;s attempted peace negotiations with the Western Allies behind Hitler&#x27;s back. Fegelein was shot after Hitler expelled Himmler from all his posts. Hitler&#x27;s secretary, Traudl Junge, recounted seeing Müller on 22 April; she also added that Müller had assumed Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s former duties as head of the RSHA. Both Junge and &quot;Oberscharführer&quot; Rochus Misch, the telephone operator for the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, recalled seeing Müller on 30 April, the date of Hitler&#x27;s suicide.

===Disappearance===
Müller was last seen in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; on the following evening. Hans Baur, Hitler&#x27;s pilot, later quoted him as saying, &quot;We know the Russian methods exactly. I haven&#x27;t the faintest intention of being taken prisoner by the Russians&quot;. From that day onwards, no trace of Müller has ever been found. He is the most senior member of the Nazi government whose fate remains a mystery. Author and former British intelligence officer, Adrian Weale, claims that the evidence about Müller indicates that he was most likely killed or committed suicide during the chaotic fall of Berlin, but his body, if recovered, was never identified.

The United States Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s (CIA) file on Müller was released under the Freedom of Information Act in 2001 and documents several unsuccessful attempts by U.S. agencies to find him. The U.S. National Archives commentary on the file concludes: &quot;Though inconclusive on Müller&#x27;s ultimate fate, the file is very clear on one point. The Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessors did not know Müller&#x27;s whereabouts at any point after the war. In other words, the CIA was never in contact with Müller.&quot; The CIA file shows an extensive search, led by the counterespionage branch of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (forerunner of the CIA), was made for Müller in the months after Germany&#x27;s surrender. The search was complicated by the fact that &quot;Heinrich Müller&quot; is a very common German name. A further problem arose because &quot;some of these Müllers, including Gestapo Müller, did not appear to have middle names. An additional source of confusion was that there were two different SS generals named Heinrich Müller&quot;.

In 1947, American and British agents searched the home of Müller&#x27;s wartime mistress, Anna Schmid, but found nothing suggesting that he was still alive. With the onset of the Cold War and the shift of priorities to meeting the challenge of the USSR, interest in pursuing missing Nazis declined. By this time, the conclusion seems to have been reached that Müller was most likely dead. The Royal Air Force Special Investigation Branch also had an interest in Müller with regard to the Stalag Luft III murders, for which he was presumed to have responsibility given his position in the Gestapo.

Walter Schellenberg alleged in his memoir that Müller had defected to the Soviet Union in 1945. He also wrote that a German officer—who had been a prisoner of war in the USSR—claimed to have seen Müller in Moscow in 1948, and that he had died shortly afterward. There is no reference in the memoir as to who the German officer was or any other details that might help verify this claim.

The capture and subsequent trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 sparked new interest in Müller&#x27;s whereabouts. Although Eichmann revealed no specific information, he told his Israeli interrogators that he believed that Müller was still alive. The West German office in charge of the prosecution of war criminals charged the police to investigate. The possibility that Müller was working for the USSR was considered, but no definite information was gained. Müller&#x27;s family and his former secretary were placed under surveillance by the Allies in case he was corresponding with them.

The West Germans investigated several reports of Müller&#x27;s body being found and buried in the days after the fall of Berlin. The reports were contradictory, not wholly reliable and it was not possible to confirm any of them. One such report came from Walter Lüders, a former member of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, who said he had been part of a burial unit which had found the body of an SS general in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, with the identity papers of Heinrich Müller. The body had been buried in a mass grave at the old Jewish Cemetery on Grosse Hamburger Strasse in the Soviet Sector. Since this location was in East Berlin in 1961, the gravesite could not be investigated by West German authorities, nor has there been any attempt to excavate the site since the reunification of Germany.

In 1961, Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Goleniewski, the Deputy Chief of Polish Military Counter Intelligence, defected to the U.S. Goleniewski had worked as an interrogator of captured German officials from 1948 to 1952. He never met Müller but said he had heard from his Soviet superiors that sometime between 1950 and 1952, the Soviets had &quot;picked up Müller and taken him to Moscow&quot;. The CIA tried to track down the men Goleniewski named as having worked with Müller in Moscow but were unable to confirm his story. Israel also continued to pursue Müller: in 1967, two Israeli operatives were caught by West German police attempting to break into the Munich apartment of Müller&#x27;s wife.
In 1967, a man in Panama City named Francis Willard Keith was accused of being Müller. West German diplomats pressed the Panamanian government to extradite him for trial. West German prosecutors said Sophie Müller, 64, had seen photos of Keith and identified him as her long-missing husband. However, Keith was released once fingerprints proved he was not Müller.

The CIA investigation concluded: &quot;There is little room for doubt that the Soviet and Czechoslovak [intelligence] services circulated rumors to the effect that Müller had escaped to the West ... to offset the charges that the Soviets had sheltered the criminal ... There are strong indications but no proof that Müller collaborated with [the Soviets]. There are also strong indications but no proof that Müller died [in Berlin].&quot; The CIA apparently remained convinced at that time that if Müller had survived the war, he was being harboured within the USSR. However, when the USSR collapsed in 1991 and the Soviet archives were opened, no evidence to support this belief emerged. The U.S. National Archives commentary concludes: &quot;More information about Müller&#x27;s fate might still emerge from still secret files of the former Soviet Union. The CIA file, by itself, does not permit definitive conclusions. Taking into account the currently available records, the authors of this report conclude that Müller most likely died in Berlin in early May 1945.&quot; By the 1990s, it was in any case increasingly unlikely Müller, who was born in 1900, would be alive even if he had survived the war.

In 2008, German historian Peter Longerich published a biography of Himmler—translated into English in 2012—that contained an unsubstantiated account of Müller&#x27;s last known whereabouts. According to reports from Himmler&#x27;s adjutant, Werner Grothmann, Müller was with Himmler at Flensburg on 11 May 1945 and accompanied Himmler and other SS officers as they attempted to escape the Allies on foot. Himmler and Müller parted company at Meinstedt, after which Müller was not seen again.

In 2013, Johannes Tuchel, the head of the Memorial to the German Resistance, claimed Müller&#x27;s body was found in August 1945 by a work crew cleaning up corpses and was one of 3,000 buried in a mass grave on the site of a former Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte. While Tuchel was confident he had solved the mystery, whether Müller is actually there has not been confirmed. Nonetheless, the uncertainty of Müller&#x27;s ultimate end and/or whereabouts has only served to nourish the &quot;mysterious power&quot; that the Gestapo elicits even to the present.

== Alleged CIC dossier ==
In July 1988, author Ian Sayer received from an anonymous individual a 427-page document, purported to be a photocopy of a U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) file that had been inadvertently released by the U.S. National Archives. The dossier alleged that Heinrich Müller had survived the war and had worked for the CIC as an intelligence adviser.

Sayer and co-author Douglas Botting were known to be working on a comprehensive history of the CIC at that time. The dossier had also come to the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, who subsequently sought Sayer&#x27;s opinion on the veracity of the documents. By this time the anonymous individual (later identified as Gregory Douglas) had managed to interest &quot;Time&quot; magazine and &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in his story. Historians such as Anton Joachimsthaler and Luke Daly-Groves regard the claims of the dossier, which include a conspiracy theory (involving a body double) about Hitler&#x27;s death, as exemplifying created &quot;myths&quot;.

<text>RONA inc. (stylized as RONA) is a Canadian retailer of home improvement and construction products and services, owned by U.S.-based private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Founded in 1939, the company operates a mixture of company-owned and franchised retailers under multiple banners, including Rona, its big box formats Rona Home &amp; Garden (Rona L’Entrepôt in Quebec), Rona+, as well as smaller brands such as Rona Cashway, Moffatt &amp; Powell and Dick&#x27;s Lumber.

Lowe&#x27;s acquired Rona for $3.2 billion CAD in May 2016. In November 2022, Lowe&#x27;s announced it would sell its Canadian operations, including Rona, to Sycamore Partners; the deal was completed the following February. Rona announced in July 2023 that it would begin converting Lowe&#x27;s locations to the new banner Rona+. 

==History==
In September 1939, Rona was founded as &quot;Les Marchands en Quincaillerie&quot; (The Merchants of Hardware), an alliance of independent Montreal-area hardware retailers who sought the buying power to bypass wholesalers and deal directly with manufacturers to get around a monopoly that threatened their ability to access supplies. Within two years they opened their first warehouse, and in 1946 held their first dealer show. 

On July 20, 1960, the Ro-Na name was adopted, named after Roland Dansereau and Napoleon Piotte, co-founders of Les Marchands en Quincaillerie. Ro-Na member stores begin adding the Ro-Na logo to identify themselves as members of the buying co-operative. M. Dansereau held controlling interest in the company until 1962, when M. Piotte and ten other dealers bought his shares and formed a true dealer co-operative, which they renamed Le Groupe RONA Inc.

In 1982, Rona purchased the assets of Botanix. In 1984, Rona created a purchasing alliance with Ontario-based Home Hardware Stores Ltd. through Alliance Rona Home Inc. In 1988, Rona merged with Dismat, another building materials company, to create Rona Dismat Group Inc. In 1990, Rona formed an alliance with Hardware Wholesalers, Inc. of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Appointment in 1992 of Robert Dutton as President and CEO of RONA. In 1997, ITM Entreprises S.A., a France-based group, invests $30 million in the Rona Dismat Group Inc. ITM became a shareholder and created a purchasing alliance with Rona.

In 1998, Rona stopped using the Le Quincailleur and Dismat names and introduced Rona L&#x27;express, Rona L&#x27;express Matériaux and Rona Le Rénovateur Régional. Rona also changed its name from Rona Dismat Group Inc. to Rona Inc. In 1999, Rona opened a new warehouse adjacent to its headquarters, measuring 654,000 square feet (ca. 6 ha), doubling its warehousing capacity. In the year 2000, Rona acquired Ontario-based Cashway Building Centres, with 66 stores. In the same year, Rona opened its online store on the rona.ca website. In 2001, Rona acquired 51 Revy Home and Garden (based in British Columbia), Revelstoke Home Centres (located in Western Canada) and Lansing Building Supply (based in North York, Ontario since 1951 and merged with Revelstoke in 1998) stores, thus owning many more stores in the Greater Toronto Area.

In 2002, Rona closed a public offering consisting of a total offering of $150.1 million in common shares. Rona&#x27;s common shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;RON&quot;. In 2003, Rona acquired Réno-Dépôt Inc. from British Kingfisher plc, including The Building Box stores. Rona also opened its third large distribution centre in Calgary, Alberta. In 2004, Rona acquired Totem Building Supplies Limited, an Alberta company. Rona also joined the Air Miles Award Program the same year, allowing customers to gain Air Miles points while shopping at the store. Two TV shows sponsored by RONA, Rona Dream Home and Ma Maison Rona were released in 2004.

In 2006, Rona acquired Stephens Home Centre/Castle Inc, a company based in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Rona also acquired a majority (51%) stake in Matériaux Coupal Inc as well as Curtis Lumber Building Supplies and Chester Dawe Limited, a company based in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, Rona acquired Dick&#x27;s Lumber, a company based in Burnaby, British Columbia. In 2007, Rona acquired Noble Trade, a company based in Concord, Ontario. In 2009, My Rona Home first aired. In 2010, Rona acquired Pierceys, a company based in Nova Scotia, Plomberie Payette &amp; Perreault, a company based in Boucherville, Quebec, Moffatt &amp; Powell, a company based in London, Ontario, Don Park Canada, and TruServ.

In 2012, the U.S. hardware store chain Lowe&#x27;s attempted to buy Rona; however, the deal was met with objections from Rona shareholders (particularly the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and franchisees, and was eventually called off. On February 3, 2016, Rona announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Lowe&#x27;s for CDN$3.2 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Post-merger, Lowe&#x27;s plans to maintain Rona&#x27;s retail banners, and &quot;continue to employ the vast majority of its current employees and maintain key executives from Rona&#x27;s strong leadership team&quot;. Lowe&#x27;s Canada will be operated from Rona&#x27;s headquarters in Boucherville, but remain under the leadership of its current CEO Sylvain Prud&#x27;homme. The purchase was closed in May 2016. In December 2016, Lowe&#x27;s announced that it planned to convert selected Rona-branded stores to the Lowe&#x27;s brand.

In 2019, acting upon a public complaint, Advertising Standards Canada ruled that Rona&#x27;s continued display of signage such as &quot;Truly Canadian&quot; and &quot;Proudly Canadian&quot; on storefronts following the sale to the American-based Lowe&#x27;s was misleading. Rona subsequently removed the signage.

In November 2022, Lowe&#x27;s agreed to sell its Canadian operations (including the Lowe&#x27;s-branded stores) to the American private equity firm Sycamore Partners, which also operates, among other properties, Staples Canada. Following the sale, Rona planned to convert the Lowe&#x27;s-branded stores to the Rona brand. The sale was completed on February 3, 2023. Rona announced in May 2024 that it would also convert Réno-Dépôt locations to the Rona+ banner.
==Retail operations==
Rona is a participant in the voluntary Scanner Price Accuracy Code managed by the Retail Council of Canada.

===Big box stores===
In the 1990s, Rona established the Rona Home &amp; Garden stores. Rona Home &amp; Garden stores are large, ranging from , with a warehouse-style similar to The Home Depot and Lowe&#x27;s. Faced with chronic under-performance in some markets outside of Quebec, Rona closed six big box stores in 2012, five in Ontario and one in British Columbia.

While stores of Home Depot and Lowe&#x27;s as well as the defunct Réno-Dépôt chain have always been company owned, Rona Home &amp; Garden locations were until 2015 a combination of corporately owned and franchised. As warehouse home improvement stores entered the market, Rona had brought together successful owners of small Rona affiliate stores in Quebec to invest in one or more big box format stores despite the massive investment required to build such outlets. Thus many Rona Home &amp; Garden locations in that province had local ownership, a tradition of the family hardware store, and a great deal of flexibility to adapt to the market at the store level. Barring a few locations in Ontario, almost all of Rona&#x27;s big-box format stores in the rest of Canada were entirely corporate-owned. In 2015, Rona acquired all remaining Rona Home &amp; Garden franchise stores across the country to make the big box chain wholly-owned by the company. 

In December 2016, Lowe&#x27;s Canada announced that 40 large-format Rona stores outside of Quebec would be rebranded under the Lowe&#x27;s name, as part of an effort to re-position the Rona brand for mid-size stores.

In July 2023, following the sale of Rona to Sycamore Partners, Rona announced that it would introduce a new store banner known as Rona+ to encompass the former Lowe&#x27;s locations. The conversion began with 10 locations in Ontario on July 27, 2023 and was completed in March 2024 with the Lowe&#x27;s stores in Western Canada. On September 26, 2024, Rona indicated its intentions to rebrand all remaining Réno-Dépôt stores to Rona+ as of October 10, 2024. The renodepot.com website would close and redirect customers to rona.ca. In December 2024, Rona announced that 15 Rona L&#x27;Entrepôt (Rona Home &amp; Garden) stores, all located in Quebec, would in turn switch to the Rona+ nameplate by May 2025.

<text>The 101st kilometre (, &quot;sto pervyy kilometr&quot;) is a colloquial phrase for restrictions on freedom of movement in the Soviet Union.

== Practice ==
The 101st kilometre became a colloquial phrase for limits on freedom of movement under &quot;propiska&quot;, the Soviet system of controlling internal migration. During most of the Soviet era, criminals and other &quot;undesirables&quot; including the ones released from the Gulags were often restricted from settling in larger urban centers such as Moscow. The &quot;propiska&quot; laws were intended in part to keep undesirable elements away from foreigners, who were usually restricted to areas within of city centers, in a similar fashion to the 1980 Olympics. The rights of an ex-inmate to move freely about the country after release from a prison would be restricted for a long period of time. Instead of regular documents, former inmates would receive a temporary substitute, a &quot;wolf ticket&quot; (), confining them to exile without the right to settle closer than to large urban centres where they would be refused the residency permit under the &quot;propiska&quot; system.

In post-Stalin Soviet Union a notable purge of undesirables beyond the 101st km was in preparations to the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games as an effort of the authorities to improve the image of Moscow in the eyes of foreigners. 

In modern Russia, this 100 km restriction has been abolished — although a version of &quot;propiska&quot; still remains.

<doc id="550104" wikidata="Q848628" url="?curid=550104" title="Bowen's reaction series">
<text>Within the field of geology, Bowen&#x27;s reaction series is the work of the Canadian petrologist Norman L. Bowen, who summarized, based on experiments and observations of natural rocks, the sequence of crystallization of common silicate minerals from typical basaltic magma undergoing fractional crystallization (i.e. crystallization wherein early-formed crystals are removed from the magma by crystal settling, leaving behind a liquid of slightly different composition). Bowen&#x27;s reaction series is able to explain why certain types of minerals tend to be found together while others are almost never associated with one another. He experimented in the early 1900s with powdered rock material that was heated until it melted and then allowed to cool to a target temperature whereupon he observed the types of minerals that formed in the rocks produced. He repeated this process with progressively cooler temperatures and the results he obtained led him to formulate his reaction series which is still accepted today as the idealized progression of minerals produced by cooling basaltic magma that undergoes fractional crystallization. Based upon Bowen&#x27;s work, one can infer from the minerals present in a rock the relative conditions under which the material had formed.

==Description==

The series is divided into two branches, the continuous (felsic minerals: feldspars) and the discontinuous (mafic minerals). The minerals at the top of the illustration (given aside) are first to crystallize and so the temperature gradient can be read to be from high to low with the high-temperature minerals being on the top and the low-temperature ones on the bottom. The branch on the right of the illustration is the continuous one (with continuous solid solutions of felsic minerals) and results in progressively sodium-rich plagioclase at lowering temperatures. In the discontinuous series mafic minerals such as olivine will first crystallize at a higher temperature, as magma cools. However, if they are not precipitated (settled) out, the composition of the magma does not change and as the magma further cools the olivine will recrystallise as pyroxene.

Since the surface of the Earth is a low temperature environment compared to the zones of rock formation, the chart also reflects the relative stability of minerals, with the ones at bottom being most stable and the ones at top being quickest to weather, known as the Goldich dissolution series. This is because minerals are most stable in the temperature and pressure conditions closest to those under which they had formed.

<text>Boucherville () is a city in the Montérégie region in Quebec, Canada. It is a suburb of Montreal on the South shore of the Saint Lawrence River.

Boucherville is part of both the urban agglomeration of Longueuil and Montreal Metropolitan Community regional government.

==History==
===Early history===
Boucherville was founded as a seigneurial parish in 1667 by Pierre Boucher, for whom the city was later named. Pierre Boucher came from Mortagne-au-Perche, Normandy, France. After having lived in Quebec City and Trois-Rivières, Boucher moved to the Percées Islands by the southern shores of Saint Lawrence River, where he founded Boucherville.

The first Catholic church of the village of Boucherville was built in 1670. This church, made of wood, was eventually replaced in 1712 by a building made of brick. It was replaced in 1801 by the current Sainte-Famille Church.

Several families left Boucherville in the 18th century to found the communities of Sainte-Julie and Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville.

===1843 Fire and its aftermath===
In July 1843 fire destroyed much of the village. Sparks blowing from a steamer ignited a wooden building owned by Mr. Weilbrenner (lot 112). The fire spread and soon most of the village was on fire. In the end, the church, the chapel, two schools, 51 homes and pastures, and 92 other buildings were destroyed.

The village was progressively rebuilt. A new church was built on the site of the old one over the course of the following two years. Parts of the walls and front were reused. A stone school was built in 1851 at the intersection of Notre-Dame and Louis-Hippolyte-Lafontaine streets.

===Evolution in the late 19th and early 20th centuries===
The municipality of the parish Sainte-Famille de Boucherville was established in 1845. This large territory included the village of Boucherville. In 1856, Sainte-Famille de Boucherville was divided into two separate municipalities: the parish Sainte-Famille de Boucherville and the village of Boucherville.

In 1854, seigneurial tenure was abolished. Pierre-Amable Boucher de Boucherville, last seigneur of Boucherville, died three years later.

The village Boucherville was to become an important vacation resort by the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. People from Montreal could access the village by train or ferry.

Boucherville experienced significant growth after World War II. This expansion was confirmed by the construction of the Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel.

The parish Sainte-Famille de Boucherville ceded portions of its territory to Saint-Hubert in 1877, to Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville in 1950 and to the village of Boucherville in 1956.

===Post-war to today===

The village of Boucherville gained the status of city in 1957.

In 1963, the city of Boucherville merged with the Sainte-Famille de Boucherville parish. This brought Boucherville to its current city limits.

Boucherville opened a new &#x27;civic centre&#x27;, including an indoor and outdoor pool, municipal offices and indoor arena in 1966. The centre was later renamed in memory of the murdered cabinet minister Pierre Laporte. In August 2015, the Centre was closed as part of a three-year, $27 million refurbishment project. The shell of the old building will be blended into the new facility. Some of the equipment, such as the skating rink boards and glass will be reused in the Gilles-Chabot arena.

Boucherville was heavily affected by the January 1998 North American ice storm. Due to the loss of power, a Canadian National Railway M420W was intentionally derailed and brought to the city hall to serve as an emergency generator.

As part of the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec, Boucherville ceased to exist as an independent city on January 1, 2002 and became a borough of Longueuil. However, after a 2004 referendum, it de-merged and was reconstituted as an independent city on January 1, 2006. However, it remains part of the urban agglomeration of Longueuil.

Today, Boucherville is home to more than 40,000 inhabitants and a large industrial park.

Founder Pierre Boucher is commemorated by a museum in his name at the Séminaire Saint-Joseph and a statue erected at the National Assembly of Quebec, in addition to a monument on the Boucherville&#x27;s waterfront.

==Geography==
The &quot;Harmonie&quot; neighbourhood is located between the boulevards de Mortagne, de Montarville, de Montbrun and de Normandie. Its development is fairly recent and is essentially residential with many upscale houses. Many park and green spaces decorate the neighbourhood. The multifunctional centre of Boucherville is also there.

The &quot;Quartier des villes et provinces de France&quot; neighbourhood is located between the streets de Normandie, Gay-Lussac, Ampère and boulevard Montarville. All the streets and parks in this neighbourhood are named after provinces of France. The neighbourhood is essentially composed of separate or semi-detached houses.

&quot;Old Boucherville&quot; is the original section of the city that contains the former village and Sainte-Famille Church. The neighbourhood is located between Saint-Lawrence River, the boulevards du Fort Saint-Louis, de Montarville et de Montbrun. Many of the buildings there are officially classified as historic monuments.

The &quot;industrial section&quot; of Boucherville covers the western part of the city; from Autoroute 20 all the way to Longueuil. This section is divided into 3 industrial parks. Although these parks were inaugurated in the 1960s, it was during the last two decades that their expansion has been the greatest. In the early 1980s, they were little more 100 companies and 6 000 jobs scattered in the industrial section. Today, they are 600 companies and 15 000 jobs in various sectors. Additionally, the industrial section is home to 2 research centres. The Boisé du Tremblay Wildlife Reserve is located within this section.

The &quot;Seigneurie&quot; is a residential neighbourhood. It is located south of Fort Saint-Louis boulevard, north of de Mortagne boulevard, to the west of de Brouage street and east of the Industriel boulevard. The neighbourhood was built in the early 1960s. The Carrefour de la Seigneurie shopping mall acted as a commercial anchor to the area, hosting a Dominion supermarket, a branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, a convenience store, a pharmacy and a medical clinic. A Texaco gas station stood in its parking lot. All these businesses have since moved on or disappeared and today the mall has been eclipsed by more modern shopping centres such as the Carrefour de la Rive Sud. The neighbourhood is served by two francophone primary schools: De la Broquerie and Pierre-Boucher. There were no English-language schools in the neighbourhood. Students were bussed to either the Boucherville Elementary School (Protestant) or Marguerite Bourgeois (Catholic).

The &quot;Le domaine Sabrevois&quot; neighbourhood was built in the early 1970s. It is located east of de Montarville boul., between the streets Samuel de Champlain and Jacques-Cartier.

The &quot;Faubourg Sainte-Anne&quot; was a neighbourhood located at the south-western edge of the village, at the intersection of what are now the Montarville and Marie-Victorin boulevards (then known as &quot;chemin de la Savanne&quot; and &quot;rue Sainte-Famille&quot; respectively). Including lots 153 to 159 and serviced by several small streets, the district was last mentioned in notarized records in 1875. A plan of the neighbourhood survives in the archives of the Séminaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivières.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Boucherville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 1681, the village included 179 inhabitants that was distributed into 39 families, living on 320 acres of cultivated land.

In an 1811 report by Jacques Viger, the village included:
* 1 physician
* 4 windmills (3 operative)
* 6 merchants
* 6 blacksmiths
* 5 weavers
* 2 coopers
* 8 cabinetmakers (of which 2 also were carpenters)
* 5 butchers
* 1 wheelwright
* 2 masons
* 2 bakers
* 6 shoemakers (of which one also was a saddlemaker)
* 3 innkeepers
* 2 schools
* 91 houses (25 made of stone)

==Economy==
Boucherville&#x27;s industrial park, located near Highway 20 expanded considerably in the 1980s. In an area covering roughly 7 km2, 575 businesses now provide employment to 23 000 people.

Since 1974, the head office of Rona, a Canadian distributor and retailer in hardware, home improvement and gardening products, has been located in Boucherville. Other companies that are or were based in Boucherville include Campagna Motors, St. Just Aviation, Noveko International, Dana TM4 and Proxim.

&quot;Têtes à claques&quot;, a French language internet phenomenon, is also based in the city of Boucherville.

==Arts and culture==
===Internet===

Quebec internet comedy website Têtes à claques is based in Boucherville.

===Youth centre===

In 1973, a youth drop-in centre, the &quot;Maison des Jeunes&quot; was opened at 78 boulevard Marie-Victorin. From March 30, 1974 to late June 1974, the Maison enjoyed financial support from the local Club Richelieu.

On November 19, 1975, the &quot;Maison&quot; then moved to the old town hall, at 20 rue Pierre-Boucher. It remained there for over a quarter century, with the exception of three months in 1982 when it was relocated to the Boucherville Elementary School while the building was being renovated.

In 2001, the &quot;Maison des jeunes la Piaule&quot; moved into its new purpose-built facilities on chemin du Lac.

==Attractions==
The Îles-de-Boucherville National Park on the Boucherville Islands is a Quebec National Park located in the Saint Lawrence River facing the rest of the city. They are uninhabited but serve as a natural/recreational area for residents and tourists.

==Sports==
There are two main multifunctional sports facilities in the city of Boucherville.

=== Complexe aquatique Laurie-Eve-Cormier ===
On September 9, 2017 the Complexe aquatique Laurie-Eve-Cormier officially replaced the Centre sportif Pierre-Laporte.

=== Centre multifonctionnel Francine-Gadbois ===
Located on Lionel-Daunais road, the centre offers cultural and sporting spaces.

=== Outdoor sports ===
In 2013, Boucherville&#x27;s disc golf course became the first course in the Montreal area to be fully publicly funded.

<text>Bernice Pauahi Pākī Bishop KGCOK RoK (December 19, 1831 – October 16, 1884) was an &quot;alii&quot; (noble) of the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii and a well known philanthropist. 

==Ancestry, birth and early life==

Pauahi was born in Honolulu on December 19, 1831, in ʻAikupika the grass hut compound of her father, Abner Kuhooheiheipahu Pākī (c. 1808–1855). Pākī was an &quot;aliʻi&quot; (noble) from the island of Molokaʻi, and son of Kalani-hele-maiiluna, who descended from the &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; (ruling monarchs) of the island of Maui. Her mother was Laura Kōnia (c. 1808–1857), the younger daughter of Pauli Kaʻōleiokū (1767–1818), by his second wife, Kahailiopua Luahine. Kaʻōleiokū was the son of Kānekapōlei, wife of Kalaniʻōpuʻu and Kamehameha I, and Luahine was descended from Kalaimanokahoʻowaha who had greeted Captain Cook in 1778. Pauahi was named for her aunt, Queen Pauahi (c. 1804–1826), a widow of King Kamehameha II, and given the Christian name of Bernice.

In a surviving &quot;mele hānau&quot; (birth chant) for Pauahi, the names Kalaninuiʻīamamao and Keaweikekahialiʻiokamoku are referenced and considered the main links to the Kamehamehas as Kalaninuiʻīamamao was the father of Kalaniʻōpuʻu and &quot;stepfather&quot; of Keōua, Kamehameha I&#x27;s father while Keaweikekahialiʻiokamoku was the common ancestor of both men. Pauahi&#x27;s birth chant does not mention Kamehameha I himself.

She was adopted at birth by Princess Kīnaʻu (who took office in the position of &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot; (regent), styled as Kaʻahumanu II), but was returned to her parents in 1838 when Kīnaʻu gave birth to her daughter, Victoria Kamāmalu. Kīnaʻu died of mumps in 1839. Pauahi began attending the Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School (later called the Royal School) that same year and remained there until 1846. Her teachers were Mr. and Mrs. Cooke. Pauahi greatly enjoyed horseback riding and swimming, and she also liked music, flowers, and the outdoors. She dressed like any fashionable New York or London woman of the time.

===Marriage===

It had been planned from childhood that Pauahi, born into Hawaiian royalty, would marry her &quot;hānai&quot; (adopted) brother Prince Lot Kapuāiwa. Pauahi married businessman Charles Reed Bishop May 4, 1850, despite the objections of her parents.
Per her request, very few people attended her wedding. One of the few witnesses was Princess Elizabeth Kekaaniau, her cousin. The couple had no children of their own. They adopted a son named Keolaokalani Davis from Pauahi&#x27;s cousin Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani in 1862, against the wish of Ruth&#x27;s husband, but the infant died at the age of six months. In 1883, they offered to adopt William Kaiheekai Taylor (1882–1956), the infant son of Pauahi&#x27;s distant cousin Lydia Keōmailani Crowningburg and Wray Taylor; they had been the boy&#x27;s godparents during his christening at St. Andrews. The Taylors refused to give up their first-born son but instead offered to give one of their twin daughters to the Bishops, but they decided not to accept the second offer. The child, William Edward Bishop Kaiheekai Taylor was one of the first students at the Kamehameha&#x27;s Preparatory Department and would later serve as the &quot;kahu&quot; (caretaker) of the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at ʻMauna Ala from 1947 until his death in 1956.

==Eligible to rule==

Pauahi was educated at the Royal School and was eligible to be a named heir. Prince Lot Kapuāiwa ruled as Kamehameha V and offered Pauahi the throne on his deathbed in 1872. But, taken aback, she replied, &quot;No, no, not me; don&#x27;t think of me. I don&#x27;t need it.&quot; The king pressed on. But she again spurned the throne: &quot;Oh, no, do not think of me. There are others.&quot; The king died an hour later. Pauahi&#x27;s refusal to accept the crown allowed Lunalilo to become the first elected monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom. 

== Death and funeral ==

On October 16, 1884, at the age of 52, Pauahi died of breast cancer at Keōua Hale, Honolulu. She is interred in the Kamehameha Crypt at Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at Mauna ʻAla on Oʻahu.

At her death, her estate was the largest private landownership in the Hawaiian Islands, comprising approximately 9% of Hawaii&#x27;s total area. The revenues from these lands are used to operate the Kamehameha Schools, which were established in 1887 according to Pauahi&#x27;s will. 

==Legacy==

By the time of her death in 1884, her estate consisted of 485,563 acres (which was reduced to 375,569 acres by the January 22, 1886 meeting of the Trustees of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate) of land across the Hawaiian Islands which she had either purchased or inherited from her parents Pākī and Kōnia, from her aunt ʻAkahi, from her cousin Keʻelikōlani and other relatives. These lands were incorporated after Pauahi&#x27;s death into the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estates, which funds the Kamehameha Schools to the present day.

Bishop wished that a portion of her estate be used &quot;to erect and maintain in the Hawaiian Islands two schools... one for boys and one girls, to be known as, and called the Kamehameha Schools.&quot; She directed her five trustees to invest her estate at their discretion and use the annual income to operate the schools.
When she wrote her will, only 44,000 Hawaiians were alive. After Bishop&#x27;s death in 1884, her husband Charles Reed Bishop started work in carrying out her will.

The original Kamehameha School for Boys was established in 1887. The girls&#x27; school was established in 1894 on a nearby campus. By 1955, the schools moved to a 600-acre (2.4 km2) location in the heights above Kapālama. Some time later, Kamehameha Schools established two more campuses on outer-islands: Pukalani, Maui and the Kamehameha Schools Hawaii Campus in Keaau on the island of Hawaii.

Charles Reed Bishop founded the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in 1889 as another memorial to Pauahi, on the grounds of the original boys school.

In 1912, Walter F. Dillingham (of Dillingham Construction) purchased from the former Bernice P. Bishop Estate, which used the land for property development to create the neighborhood of Waikiki and many of its early related buildings and structures (including the Ala Wai Canal).

She was named a woman hero by The My Hero Project.

===Will===

Her will caused three major controversies. In 1992, a clause that all Kamehameha Schools teachers must be Protestant was challenged as illegal religious discrimination in employment by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a decision of the district court, and found that the school had not proved that it was &quot;primarily religious&quot;, and thus this clause violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In 1997, several conflicts of interest were charged. Trustees received up to $900,000 per year and put their own money into the investments of the estate. The Supreme Court of Hawaii was directed in the will to replacement trustees, but also ruled on many cases involving the estate. An essay by Judge Samuel Pailthorpe King and University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law Professor Randall W. Roth and others was published as a series of newspaper articles, and later a book. After a number of legal battles, the trustees resigned and management was re-organized.

Trustees were instructed &quot;to devote a portion of each year&#x27;s income to the support and education of orphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the preference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.&quot; Traditionally, this was interpreted to admit almost no students that could not prove native Hawaiian ancestry. A number of lawsuits challenged this policy. One included a settlement reported to be $7 million.

<text>Chernihiv (, ; , ) is a city and municipality in northern Ukraine, which serves as the administrative center of Chernihiv Oblast and Chernihiv Raion within the oblast. Chernihiv&#x27;s population is 

The city was designated as a Hero City of Ukraine by the Ukrainian government during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Names and etymology==
The name &quot;Chernihiv&quot;/&quot;Chernigov&quot; is a compound name, which begins with the Slavic root &quot;Cherni-&quot;/&quot;Cherno-&quot;, which means &#x27;black&#x27;. Scholars vary with interpretations of the second part of the name (&quot;-hiv&quot;/&quot;-gov&quot;, ) though scholars such as Dr. Martin Dimnik, Professor of Medieval History at University of Toronto, connect Chernihov with the worship of &quot;the black god&quot; Chernibog.

The city of Chernihiv is also historically known by different names in other languages – ; .

==History==
===Early history===
Chernihiv was first mentioned (as ) in the Rus&#x27;–Byzantine Treaty (907), but the time of its establishment is unknown. Artifacts from the Khazar Khaganate uncovered by archaeological excavations at a settlement there indicate that it seems to have existed at least as early as the 9th century. Towards the end of the 10th century, the city probably had its own rulers. It was there that the Black Grave, one of the largest and earliest royal mounds in Eastern Europe, was excavated in the 19th century.

The city was the second wealthiest and most important in the southern portion of the Kievan Rus&#x27;. From the early 11th century on, it was the seat of the powerful Principality of Chernigov, whose rulers at times vied for power with Kievan Grand Princes, and often overthrew them and took the primary seat in Kiev for themselves.

The grand principality was the largest in Kievan Rus and included not only the Severian towns but even such remote regions as Murom, Ryazan and Tmutarakan. The golden age of Chernigov, when the city population peaked at 25,000, lasted until 1239 when the city was sacked by the hordes of Batu Khan, and entered a long period of relative obscurity.

The area fell under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1353. The city was burned again by Crimean khan Meñli I Giray in 1482 and 1497 and in the 15th to 17th centuries changed hands several times between Lithuania, Muscovy (1408–1420 and from 1503), and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1618–1648), where it was granted Magdeburg rights in 1623 and in 1635 became a seat of Chernihiv Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province.

The area&#x27;s importance increased again in the middle of the 17th century during and after the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In the Hetman State, Chernihiv was the city of deployment for the Chernihiv Cossack regiment (both a military and territorial unit of the state at the time).

===Imperial Russia===
Under the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo the legal suzerainty of the area was ceded to the Tsardom of Russia, with Chernihiv remaining an important center of the autonomous Cossack Hetmanate. With the abolishment of the Hetmanate, the city became an ordinary administrative center of the Russian Empire and a capital of local administrative units. The area in general was ruled by the Governor-General appointed from Saint Petersburg, the imperial capital, and Chernihiv was the capital of local namestnichestvo (province) (from 1782), Malorosiyskaya or Little Russian (from 1797) and Chernigov Governorate (from 1808).

According to the census of 1897, the city of Chernihiv had 11,000 Jews out of a total population of 27,006. Their primary occupations were industrial and commercial. Many tobacco plantations and fruit gardens in the neighborhood were owned by Jews. There were 1,321 Jewish artisans in Chernihiv, including 404 tailors and seamstresses, but the demand for artisan labor was limited to the town. There were 69 Jewish day-laborers, almost exclusively teamsters. Few, however, were employed in factories.

===World War II===
During World War II, Chernihiv was occupied by the German Army from 9 September 1941 to 21 September 1943. The Germans operated a Nazi prison and a forced labour battalion for Jews in the city.

===Independent Ukraine===
The Statue of Lenin on Myru Avenue was toppled on February 21, 2014, as part of the demolitions of the statues of Lenin in Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Chernihiv was designated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to Chernihiv Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Chernihiv Oblast to five, the city was merged into Chernihiv Raion.

In June 2022, Chernihiv signed an agreement with Rzeszów, Poland to become sister cities.

====Siege of Chernihiv====
On 24 February 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city was under siege by the Russian Armed Forces according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, in its first battle since the Second World War. On 10 March 2022, Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko announced that the city had been completely encircled by Russian forces.

On 5 April 2022, Governor of Chernihiv Oblast Vyacheslav Chaus stated that the Russian military had left Chernihiv Oblast, but that it had planted mines in many areas.

On 19 August 2023, a Russian missile strike killed seven in the city. On 17 April 2024, another Russian missile strike killed around 18 people in the city.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
Distribution of the population by native language according to the 2001 census:
Despite considering Ukrainian a native language, many still didn&#x27;t use it in daily life, as Russian remained the primary language for communication in Chernihiv. A 2017 survey that asked what language do participants use at home revealed that only Ukrainian was spoken only by 18% of the city&#x27;s population, both Ukrainian and Russian were at 28%, while Russian was the most at 53%.

The 2022 Russian invasion caused a new wave of Ukrainization in Chernihiv, with more and more people switching to Ukrainian in their private lives. According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute between April and May 2023, 53% of the city&#x27;s population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 41% spoke Russian.

== Geography ==
Chernihiv stands on the Desna River to the north-northeast of Kyiv.

The area was served by Chernihiv Shestovytsia Airport prior to 2002, and during the Cold War it was the site of Chernihiv air base.

=== Rivers ===
==== Desna River ==== 
The city of Chernihiv is crossed by Desna River, a major left tributary of the Dnieper River. &quot;Desna&quot; means &quot;right hand&quot; in the Old East Slavic language. It is long, and has a drainage basin that covers .

In Ukraine, the river&#x27;s width ranges from , with its average depth being . The mean annual discharge at its mouth is . The river freezes over from early December to early April and is navigable from Novhorod-Siverskyi to its mouth, for about .

==== Stryzhen River ====

==== Snov River ====
The Snov River, right tributary of the Desna River (Dnieper basin) has its mouth 12 km to the east of Chernihiv. The length of the river is . The area of its drainage basin is . The Snov freezes in November – late January and stays icebound until March – early April. Part of the river forms the Russia–Ukraine border.

According to Ruthenian chronicles, in 1068 a battle took place at the Snov River between Duke of Chernihiv Sviatoslav Yaroslavich and Cumans led by Duke Sharukan.

Precipitation is well distributed throughout the year though precipitation is higher during the summer months and lower during the winter months. The record high was and the record low was .

==Architecture==

Chernihiv&#x27;s architectural monuments chronicle the two most flourishing periods in the city&#x27;s history – those of Kievan Rus&#x27; (11th and 12th centuries) and of the Cossack Hetmanate (late 17th and early 18th centuries).

The oldest church in the city and one of the oldest churches in Ukraine is the 5-domed Transfiguration Cathedral, commissioned in the early 1030s by Mstislav the Bold and completed several decades later by his brother, Yaroslav the Wise. The Cathedral of Sts Boris and Gleb, dating from the mid-12th century, was much rebuilt in succeeding periods, before being restored to its original shape in the 20th century. Likewise built in brick, it has a single dome and six pillars.

The crowning achievement of Chernihiv masters was the exquisite Piatnytska Church, constructed at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. This graceful building was seriously damaged in the Second World War; its original medieval outlook was reconstructed to a design by Pyotr Baranovsky.

The historic center of Chernihiv has been on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List since 1989, but currently the creation of a renewed nomination is underway.

The earliest residential buildings in the downtown date from the late 17th century, a period when a Cossack regiment was deployed there. Two most representative residences are those of Polkovnyk Lyzohub (1690s) and Polkovnyk Polubotok (18th century). The former mansion, popularly known as the Mazepa House, used to contain the regiment&#x27;s chancellery. One of the most profusely decorated Cossack structures is undoubtedly the ecclesiastical collegium, surmounted by a bell-tower (1702). The archbishop&#x27;s residence was constructed nearby in the 1780s. St. Catherine Church (1715), with its 5 gilded pear domes, traditional for Ukrainian architecture, is thought to have been intended as a memorial to the regiment&#x27;s exploits during the storm of Azov in 1696.

===Monasteries===
All through the most trying periods of its history, Chernihiv retained its ecclesiastical importance as the seat of either a bishopric or an archbishopric. At the outskirts of the modern city lie two ancient cave monasteries formerly used as the bishops&#x27; residences.

The caves of the Yeletskyi Monastery are said to predate those of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (Kyiv Monastery of the Caves). Its magnificent six-pillared cathedral was erected at the turn of the 11th to 12th centuries; some traces of its 750-year-old murals may still be seen in the interior. After the domes collapsed in 1611, they were augmented and reconstructed in the Ukrainian baroque style. The wall, monastic cells, and bell-tower all date from the 17th century.

The nearby mother superior&#x27;s house is thought to be the oldest residential building in the Left-Bank Ukraine. The cloister&#x27;s holiest icon used to be that of Theotokos, who made her epiphany to Sviatoslav of Chernigov on 6 February 1060. The icon, called Yeletskaya after the fir wood it was painted upon, was taken to Moscow by Svyatoslav&#x27;s descendants, the Baryatinsky family, in 1579.

The nearby Chernihiv Glory Memorial we can find Saint Anthony Caves of Saint Elijah and the Holy Trinity features a small eponymous church, built 800 years ago. The roomy Trinity cathedral, one of the most imposing monuments of Cossack baroque, was erected between 1679 and 1689. Its refectory, with the adjoining church of Presentation to the Temple, was finished by 1679. There are also the 17th-century towered walls, monastic cells, and the five-tiered belfry from the 1780s.

Other historic abbeys in the vicinity of Chernihiv include those in Kozelets and Hustynia, which feature superb examples of Ukrainian Baroque.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Cheksil, one of the largest enterprises in the Ukrainian textile industry, is based in Chernihiv. The first stage of the plant was put into operation in 1963. The city also has the Chernihiv Musical Instrument Factory established in 1933. In 1995 a manufacturer of goods for animals, called COLLAR Company, was established by Yuri Sinitsa.

==Education==
 Chernihiv has the Chernihiv Polytechnic National University and Taras Shevchenko National University &quot;Chernihiv College&quot;.

==Transport==
=== Train ===
 Chernihiv has a train station with bus station called Chernihiv Ovruch railway. Narrow gauge railway of 76 versts was laid from the Kruty station of the Moscow Kyiv-Voronezh railway towards Chernihiv. In 1893, on the left bank of the Desna River, in the area of a modern automobile bridge, a railway station was built along the Kyiv highway. Passengers were delivered here from the city and back by horse transport.

In 1925, traffic was opened on the Nizhyn to Chernigiv section of the Southwest Railway. But rail transport in Chernihiv was postponed until 1928. The bridge over the Desna River was not ready and trains still arrived on the left bank, where the old narrow-gauge railway station was located, and passengers got to Chernihiv by road bridge. According to 2006 data, the volume of freight traffic is 84,737 wagons per year. Over 4.5 million passengers are transported each year.

However, the condition of the rolling stock and the quality of the services provided do not meet modern requirements. Since the introduction of the new high-speed train timetable, the trailed wagons of the 93/94 Chernihiv – Odesa train were canceled. As of 2015, regular trains from Minsk to Odesa, and from St. Petersburg to Kyiv to Kharkiv run through Chernihiv, and there are direct connections with Moscow. Trains to Crimea (Simferopol, Feodosia) were canceled on 27 December 2014 due to Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea.

Public transport includes buses and trolleybuses. There is no direct connection between railway station and Chernihiv-1 bus station to the most central sights on the Val.

<text>Education in Thailand is provided mainly by the Thai government through the Ministry of Education from pre-school to senior high school. A free basic education to fifteen years is guaranteed by the Thai constitution. This basic education comprises six years of elementary school and three years of lower secondary school. In addition, three years of pre-school and three years of upper-secondary education is available free of charge, but are non-compulsory.

Children aged 6–12 will go to elementary school (&quot;prathom&quot; (Thai: ประถม)). From the age of 12, they attend secondary school (&quot;matthayom&quot; ()). While secondary school also lasts six years, only the first three years are mandatory. After grade 9 (Matthayom 3), pupils can pursue upper-secondary education in a university-preparatory track, or continue their studies in vocational school programs.

Homeschooling is legal in Thailand. Thailand&#x27;s constitution and education law explicitly recognize alternative education and considers the family to be an educational institution. A homeschool law passed in 2004, Ministerial Regulation No. 3 on the right to basic education by the family, governs homeschooling. Families must submit an application to homeschool and students are assessed annually.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that Thailand fulfills 69.5% of what they should be able to fulfill for the right to education, based on their level of income.

==School system overview==

Basic education in Thailand is free. It is divided into three levels: pre-primary, primary, and secondary. Pre-primary education was introduced in 2004 and made free in 2009. State schools offer two years of kindergarten (; ) (three- and four-year-old) and one year of
pre-school studies (five-year-old). Participation in pre-primary education is &quot;nearly universal&quot;. At the age of six, education begins. It lasts for nine years, consisting of primary, &quot;prathom&quot; () (grades P1-6), and lower secondary, &quot;matthayom&quot; () (grades M1-3), starting at the age of 12. Upper secondary education, grades M4-6, is also not compulsory. It is divided into general and vocational tracks.

Ninety-nine per cent of students complete primary education. Only 85 per cent complete lower secondary. About 75 per cent move on to upper secondary (ages 16–18). For every 100 students in primary schools, 85.6 students will continue studies in M1, 79.6 students will continue until M3, and only 54.8 will go on to M6 or occupational schools.

There are academic upper secondary schools, vocational upper secondary schools, and comprehensive schools offering academic and vocational tracks. Students who choose the academic stream usually intend to enter a university. Vocational schools offer programs that prepare students for employment or further studies.

Admission to an upper secondary school is through an entrance exam. On the completion of each level, students need to pass the NET (National Educational Test) to graduate. Children are required to attend six years of elementary school and at least the first three years of high school. Those who graduate from the sixth year of high school are candidates for two tests: O-NET (Ordinary National Educational Test) and A-NET (Advanced National Educational Test).

Public schools are administered by the government. The private sector includes schools run for profit and fee-paying non-profit schools which are often run by charitable organisations — especially by Catholic diocesan and religious orders that operate over 143 large elementary/secondary schools throughout the country. Village and sub-district schools usually provide pre-school kindergarten and elementary classes, while in the district towns, schools will serve their areas with comprehensive schools with all the classes from kindergarten to age 15 and separate secondary schools for ages 13 through 18.

Due to budgetary limitations, rural schools are generally less well equipped than the schools in the cities. The standard of instruction, particularly for the English language, is much lower, and many high school students will commute 60–80 kilometres to schools in the nearest city.

The school year is divided into two semesters. Usually Schools start their academic terms midway through the year. 
For Public Schools the first semester begins in mid May and ends around late September or early October; the second begins around late October or early November and ends around late February or early March. 
There are approximately 12 weeks of holiday per academic year.
For Private Schools the first semester starts in August and ends in December. The second term starts in January and ends in July. Some International Schools follow English school holidays (Usually August to July, but divided over three terms).


==History==
Formal education has its early origins in the temple schools, when it was available to boys only. From the mid-sixteenth century Thailand opened up to significant French Catholic influence until the mid-seventeenth century when it was heavily curtailed, and the country returned to a strengthening of its own cultural ideology. Unlike other parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly the Indian subcontinent, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia and the Philippines, Thailand has never been colonised by a Western power. As a result, structured education on the lines of that in developed countries gained new impetus with the reemergence of diplomacy in the late nineteenth century.

===Early education===
It is possible that one of the earliest forms of education began when King Ram Khamhaeng the Great invented the Thai alphabet in 1283 basing it on Mon, Khmer, and southern Indian scripts. Stone inscriptions from 1292 in the new script depict moral, intellectual and cultural aspects. During the Sukhothai period (1238–1378), education was dispensed by the Royal Institution of Instruction (&quot;Rajabundit&quot;) to members of the royal family and the nobility, while commoners were taught by Buddhist monks.

In the period of the Ayutthaya kingdom from 1350 to 1767 during the reign of King Narai the Great (1656–1688), the &quot;Chindamani&quot;, generally accepted as the first textbook of the Thai language, collating the grammar. The prosody of Thai language and official forms of correspondence was written by a monk, Pra Horatibodi, in order to stem the foreign educational influence of the French Jesuit schools It remained in use up to King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s reign (1868–1910). Narai himself was a poet, and his court became the center where poets congregated to compose verses and poems. Although through his influence interest in Thai literature was significantly increased, Catholic missions had been present with education in Ayutthaya as early as 1567 under Portuguese Dominicans and French Jesuits were given permission to settle in Ayutthaya in 1662. His reign therefore saw major developments in diplomatic missions to and from Western powers.

On Narai&#x27;s death, fearing further foreign interference in Thai education and culture, and conversion to Catholicism, xenophobic sentiments at court increased and diplomatic activities were severely reduced and ties with the West and any forms of Western education were practically severed. They did not recover their former levels until the reign of King Mongkut in the mid-nineteenth century.

===Development===
Through his reforms of the Buddhist Sangha, King Rama I (1782–1809), accelerated the development of public education and during the reign of King Rama IV (1851–1865) the printing press arrived in Thailand making books available in the Thai language for the first time; English had become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Far East, and the education provided by the monks was proving inadequate for government officials. Rama IV decreed that measures be taken to modernise education and insisted that English would be included in the curriculum.

King Rama V (1868–1910) continued to influence the development of education and in 1871 the first relatively modern concept of a school with purpose constructed building, lay teachers and a time-table was opened in the palace to teach male members of the royal family and the sons of the nobility. The Command Declaration on Schooling was proclaimed, English was being taught in the palace for royalty and nobles, and schools were set up outside the palace for the education of commoners’ children.
With the aid of foreign - mainly English - advisers a Department of Education was established by the king in 1887 by which time 34 schools, with over 80 teachers and almost 2,000 students, were in operation and as part of the king’s programme to establish ministries, in 1892 the department became the Ministry of Education. Recognizing that the private sector had come to share the tasks of providing education, the government introduced controls for private schools.

In 1897 on the initiative of Queen Sribajarindra, girls were admitted into the educational system. In 1898, a two-part education plan for Bangkok and for the provinces was launched with programmes for pre-school, elementary, secondary, technical, and higher education. In 1901, the first government school for girls, the Bamrung Wijasatri, was set up in Bangkok, and in 1913, the first teacher training school for women was set up at the Benchama Rajalai School for girls.
Further developments took place when in 1902 the plan was remodeled by National System of Education in Siam into the two categories of general education, and professional/ technical education, imposing at the same time age limits for admission to encourage graduation within predetermined time scales.

The first Thai university, Chulalongkorn, was named after King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). It was established by his son and successor King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) in 1917 by combining the Royal Pages School and the College of Medicine.
In 1921, the Compulsory Elementary Education Act was proclaimed.

=== Education for Sustainable Development ===
Thailand has a particular interpretation of education for sustainable development ESD as the ‘philosophy of sufficiency economy’ has played a leading role in shaping policy, including the National Economic and Social Development Plan and the National Education Act. ESD is highly integrated into the curriculum of primary and secondary education in Thailand through the framework of sufficiency economy. The National Curriculum of Thailand, which integrates the country’s ‘philosophy of sufficiency economy’, is an important case in point. Since 2002, the country’s education plan has promoted the inclusion of ESD in five distinct ways. First, ESD topics and content are incorporated into the eight main subject areas of the curriculum, with ESD learning standards defined in a scaffolded manner for each subject area. Second, student character development is defined by eight characteristics including active learning, sufficiency lifestyle and public mindedness. Third, the plan aims to provide specific project-based learning activities, such as natural preservation and environmental clubs and camps. Fourth, ESD-specific learning modules are developed and incorporated, such as renewable energy or the philosophy of sufficiency economy. Fifth, following structural reforms in 2008, Thailand now has a 30 per cent inclusion rate across the entire curriculum for decentralized, locally based subjects and teaching. These should address topics pertinent to the local context and often include issues relating to sustainable lifestyles and the sufficiency economy.

===Twelve values===

Prayut Chan-o-cha, Thailand&#x27;s prime minister and junta leader, said in 2017 that school reform was urgently needed. Following the military takeover of May 2014, Prayut, in a televised broadcast in July, ordered schools to display a list of 12 &quot;Thai&quot; values he composed. They are:

#Loyalty to the Nation, a Religion, and the Monarchy
#Honesty, sacrifice, endurance, and noble ideology for the greater good
#Gratitude for parents, guardians, and teachers
#Diligence in acquiring knowledge, via school studies and other methods
#Preserving the Thai customs and tradition
#Morality and good will toward others
#Correct understanding of democracy with the King as Head of State
#Discipline, respect for law, and obedience to the older citizens
#Constant consciousness to practice good deeds all the time, as taught by His Majesty the King
#Practice of Self-Sufficient Economy in accordance with the teaching of His Majesty the King
#Physical and mental strength. Refusal to surrender to religious sins.
#Uphold the interest of the nation over oneself.

Authorities instructed public schools and state agencies to hang a banner listing Gen Prayut&#x27;s teachings on their premises. State agencies have also produced a poem, song, and 12-part film based on the teachings. In late-December 2014, the Ministry of Information, Communication, and Telecommunications (MICT) released a set of &quot;stickers&quot; depicting each of the Twelve Values for users of the chat application LINE.

===Military training for kindergartners===
The military government under Prayut Chan-o-cha instituted a &quot;land defender battalion&quot; program to teach uniformed children aged four and five to do push-ups, crawl under netting, salute, and eat from metal trays on the floor. &quot;Soldiers showed children military operations and taught them patriotic values to love the nation, religions, and the Thai monarchy through the...12 Thai Values,&quot; according to the Thai-language news outlet &quot;Matichon Online&quot;. The news site reported that this is the second time that the Royal Thai Army has run the program, and said that many more schools and kindergartens will join the program in the future.

===2015 IQ survey results===
A 2015 survey by the Ministry of Public Health found the average IQ of Thai students to be 93, down from 94 in 2011, and below the international standard of 100.

One cause of lower IQs might be nutrition, specifically iodine deficiency.

In July 2015, the Thai Department of Health initiated a program to provide better nutrition and health education at Thai public schools. Its aims are to increase average IQ from 94 to 100 and boost the average height of children. Currently boys measure on average 167 cm and girls 157 cm. Over the 10-year life of the program heights are targeted to increase to 175 cm and 165 cm respectively. Children at schools across the country will receive healthier meals and more instruction on healthy living and exercise.

In 2015, a World Bank study concluded that &quot;...one-third of 15-year-old Thais are &#x27;functionally illiterate&#x27;&quot;, including almost half of those studying in rural schools. The bank suggested that Thailand reform its education system partly through merging and optimising its more than 20,000 schools nationwide. The alternative is hiring 160,000 more teachers for up-country schools in order to match Bangkok&#x27;s teacher-student ratios. &quot;The Economist&quot; notes that, &quot;Thailand&#x27;s dismal performance is not dramatically out of step with countries of similar incomes. But it is strange given its unusually generous spending on education, which in some years has hoovered up more than a quarter of the budget. Rote learning is common. There is a shortage of maths and science teachers, but a surfeit of physical-education instructors. Many head teachers lack the authority to hire or fire their own staff.&quot;

===Secondary school admissions protest===
In May 2012, parents and students at the prestigious Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School, commonly referred to as &quot;Bodin&quot;, in Bangkok staged a hunger strike to protest what they viewed as admissions irregularities. The issue arose when 200 Bodin students were denied the right to continue their studies at the school at the end of the 2011 school year. The students suspected that school executives had taken away their seats to give to children of parents willing to pay huge sums of &quot;tea money&quot; or bribes. Admission to popular schools can cost &quot;tea money&quot; sums up to seven figures. The greater the competition, the higher the amount of donations the parents believe they have to offer in exchange for their children&#x27;s chances to get a good education at a quality school.

===Status of teachers===
Thai society holds teachers in high regard as evidenced by naming one day of the year as &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Day.&quot; &quot;Thai teachers, as well as university lecturers, are not as well paid as their colleagues in Malaysia or Singapore, not to mention those in the United States or Europe,&quot; according to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;. This has led to the finding that each Thai teacher may be up to three million baht in debt. The government is taking steps to ameliorate the plight of teachers by refinancing loans owed to institutional lenders.

==Organisation==
===Administration===
Thailand has had 21 education ministers in the past 18 years (2000–2018). Each lasts an average of nine months.
The complexity of administration of Thai education gives rise to duplication among the many ministries and agencies providing education and establishing of standards. In 1980, at the recommendation of the Minister of Education, Dr. Sippanondha Ketudat, responsibility for basic elementary education was moved from the to the . Both the Ministry of University Affairs and the Ministry of Education have been actively involved in teacher training.

===Budget===
For FY2019 the budget of the Ministry of Education is 487,646 million baht. The Thai national budget allocates considerable resources to education. In FY2017, educational expenditures represented almost 20 per cent of the national budget, or four per cent of GDP. This is high in comparison with the educational expenditures of other countries, especially developing countries, with China at 13 per cent, Indonesia 8.1 per cent, Malaysia 20 per cent, Mexico, 24.3 per cent, Philippines 17 per cent, the United Kingdom and France, 11 per cent. Although education is mainly financed by the national budget, local funds, particularly in urban areas, are spent on education. In the area governed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), up to 28.1 per cent of the educational budget has been provided by local financing. Loans and technical assistance for education are also received from Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank.

==Elementary and secondary levels==

At elementary levels, students study eight core subjects each semester: Thai language, mathematics, science, social science, health and physical education, arts and music, technology, and foreign languages. At age 16 (Matthayom 4), students are allowed to choose one or two elective courses. The science program (Wit-Kanit) and the mathematics-English language program (Sil-Kamnuan) are among the most popular. Foreign language programs (Sil-Phasa) in (Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and German) for example, and the social science program (sometimes called the general program) are also offered.
Both elementary and secondary levels have special programs, the English Program and the Gifted Program. In the English Program students learn every subject in English except for Thai and social studies. The Gifted Program is mathematics-science focused.

Grade of enrollment for immigrant students is determined by their birthday. In a study about Thailand&#x27;s education policy on children of migrants, Thai schools often required migrant students to be proficient in the Thai language and to have gone through a learning center before enrolling into a public school. If a student was younger than 7, they would be placed in kindergarten, and if they were older, they would be placed in a first grade class. Therefore, students that were 15 could still enroll as a first grader. The purpose for these methods was to ensure that migrant students were better prepared to start school, but it did cause some issues for both the student and the teachers. The study found that even though older students placed in first grade classrooms were more obedient, the students had trouble connecting with their classmates and teacher had to address them differently due to their age. Thai public schools attempted to address this issue by some implementing a rule that a student could not be older than 9 to enroll, but this led to learning centers not given recommendations to public school for older students.

==Vocational education==
The Vocational Education Commission manages 416 vocational institutions of higher learning in Thailand.

Technical and vocational education (TVE) begins at the senior high school level where students begin to follow either general or vocational education tracks. At present, around 60 per cent of students follow the general education programmes. However, the government is endeavouring to achieve an equal balance between general and vocational education.

Three levels of TVE are offered: the Certificate in Vocational Education (&quot;Por Wor Chor&quot;) which is taken during the upper secondary period; the Technical Diploma (&quot;Por Wor Sor&quot;), taken after school-leaving age; and the Higher Diploma on which admission to university for a bachelor&#x27;s degree programme may be granted. Vocational education is also provided by private institutions.

In 2016, Thailand&#x27;s first technical vocational education and training (TVET) hub started in the northern province of Chiang Mai. TVET is a model that provides knowledge and skills required for workplaces, using formal, non-formal and informal learning.

===Dual vocational training (DVT)===
Essential to DVT is the active participation of the private sector. In 1995,
the Department of Vocational Education launched an initiative to introduce dual vocational training programmes which involve the students in hand-on training at selected organisations in the private sector.

DVT is a regular element of the DoVE &quot;certificate&quot; and &quot;diploma&quot; program. The training is for a period of three years with more than half of the time devoted to practical training on-the-job, spread over two days a week, or for longer periods depending on the distance, throughout the semesters.

Two levels of DVT are offered: the three-year certificate level for skilled workers where students and trainees are admitted at the age of 15 after completing Matthayom 3 (Grade 9); and the two-year diploma technician level for students who have graduated with the Certificate of Vocational Education after 12 years of formal education.

In the scheme, vocational, unlike regular internships, where students may be assigned to work on unpaid irrelevant jobs, the cooperative education programme enables students of the vocational schools to do field work while benefiting from an allowance to cover living expenses or free accommodation, and compensation for their contributions made to the company&#x27;s income and profits as temporary employees.

Schools collaborate directly with the private sector in drafting action plans and setting goals for students to meet. Generally, the company will offer permanent employment to the trainees on graduation and successful completion of the programme. Conversely, companies that recruit trainees from among young people who have completed a minimum of nine years at school may enroll their employees with a technical or vocational college where they are taught vocational subjects as the theoretical background to the occupational field in which they are being trained.

===Enrollment===
 there were 674,113 students enrolled in vocational education courses.

===Concerns of multi-national corporations===
Shiro Sadoshima, the Japanese ambassador to Thailand, believes that the Thai government must invest more in education to produce a labour force that can meet the demands of Japanese industry. He noted that while Thailand has a policy to improve vocational skills and cultivate skilled labour, the skills exhibited by Thai workers are not up to Japanese standards. The ambassador&#x27;s remarks echoed those of major Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota, which has been investing in Thailand for decades. Shuichi Ikeda, chief representative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), also voiced concerns that even though Thailand has produced a lot of vocational graduates to serve rising demand for factory workers, those graduates lack required skills. Thailand is expected to produce around 67,000 vocational graduates over the next 10 years but only around 3,100 of them can meet labour standards and get a job, he said.

== National Educational Tests ==
The National Educational Tests are tests developed by the National Institute of Educational Testing Service (NIETS) which used to also organise university admission tests such as GAT, PAT, and the General Subject Tests. The National Educational Tests include:

* Ordinary National Educational Test (O-NET)
* Buddhism National Educational Test (B-NET)
* Islamic National Educational Test (I-NET)
* Non-Formal National Educational Test (N-NET)
* Vocational National Educational Test (V-NET)

The O-NET used to be mandatory for Secondary 6 students and used in university admissions but as of 2022, the O-NET is optional and not used in university admissions.

==Higher education==
===Universities===

There are 170 institutions of higher education in Thailand, both public and private, offering 4,100 curricula. For the 2015 academic year, the universities could accommodate 156,216 new students, but only 105,046 applied to take entrance exams. Exacerbating the student shortfall, the National Economic and Social Development Board projects that the number of Thais in the school-age group 0–21 years will fall to 20 per cent of the population by 2040, a drop from 62.3 per cent in 1980.

Many public universities receive financial support from the government for research purposes. Over half of the provinces have a government-run Rajabhat University (formerly Rajabhat Institutes) and Rajamangala University of Technology, which were traditionally teacher-training colleges.

Thai universities do not score highly in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University rankings and they are losing ground when compared with other Asian universities. Thailand&#x27;s top three universities, Chulalongkorn, Mahidol, and Thammasat, are trending down. When it was first ranked by QS, Chulalongkorn came in at 201. In 2018 it was ranked 271. Several years ago, Mahidol was ranked 255 but now is ranked 380. Thammasat in 2012 was ranked 561 but has consistently been in the 600s since then.

Some of Thailand&#x27;s leading universities include:
* Burapha University: First higher education institution in eastern Thailand&#x27;s industrial region. Offering a taught course in arts and humanities, business administration, engineering, education, health sciences, science, social sciences, logistics, and tourism.
* Chiang Mai University: The first institution of higher education in northern Thailand and the first provincial university in the country, offering programs in arts and humanities, health sciences, science and technology, and social sciences.
* Chulalongkorn University: is a comprehensive and research-intensive university and the oldest institute of higher education in Thailand, offering programs in arts and humanities, engineering and technology, life sciences and medicine, natural sciences, social sciences, and management.
* Kasetsart University: Initially established as an agricultural college, it later expanded its subject area to cover a wide range of academic disciplines. It currently offers programs in agriculture, agro-industry, architecture, business administration, economics, education, engineering, environmental science, fisheries, forestry, humanities, science, social sciences, veterinary medicine, and veterinary technology.
* Khon Kaen University: First university in northeastern Thailand. Engineering, education, college of local administration.
* King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang: Best known for programs in electrical engineering, automotive engineering, computer engineering, and architecture.
* King Mongkut&#x27;s University of Technology North Bangkok: Jointly founded in 1959 by the Thai Government and the Federal Republic of Germany. Offering a specialized course in science, engineering and industrial technology.
* King Mongkut&#x27;s University of Technology Thonburi: Best known for programs in civil engineering, electrical engineering, energy technology and architecture.
* Mahidol University: Medicine (Siriraj Hospital and Ramathibodi Hospital), pharmacy, veterinary science, medical technology, health sciences
* Prince of Songkla University: First university in southern Thailand. Natural resources, tourism and hospitality, management sciences.
* Silpakorn University: Began as a fine arts university and now includes many other faculties as well.
* Srinakharinwirot University: Education, dentistry, social sciences, and humanities.
* Thammasat University: Established as a specialization and open university in Law, Business, Political Sciences, and Economics before expanded fields to become a national university. Nowadays, offers programs which covered all of social science and humanities, science and technology, and health sciences.

===Programs===

Most bachelor&#x27;s degree courses are four year, full-time programs. Exceptions are and that require five years, and the doctor of dental surgery, medicine, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine that require six years of study. Master&#x27;s degree programs last for either one or two years and the degree is conferred on course credits with either a thesis or a final exam. On completion of a master&#x27;s degree, students may apply for an admission exam to a two to five year doctoral program. The is conferred upon completion of coursework, research, and the successful submission of a dissertation. There are at least 1,000 PhD programs offered at 33 Thai universities. The number of PhD students rose to over 25,000 in 2015, up from just 1,380 in 2008.

===Admissions===

At present, Thai university admissions are done through the &quot;Thai University Central Admission System&quot; or TCAS, a central admissions system developed by the Council of University Presidents of Thailand (CUPT). This system includes four rounds of admissions: portfolio admissions, quota admissions, joint admissions, and direct admissions.

==== Round 1: Portfolio admissions ====
Universities accepting students in this round have a lot of freedom in setting admission requirements but generally look at the extracurricular activities and achievements of a student, so a portfolio containing the student&#x27;s basic information along with their extracurricular activities and achievements is expected by most universities. However, some programmes (especially international programmes) will also accept and use international standardised examinations in consideration such as the SAT, IELTS, BMAT, etc.

==== Round 2: Quota admissions ====
This round of admissions is intended to provide more opportunities in education for students in areas outside of Bangkok, the capital. This round is similar to round 1 in that programmes accepting students in this round have freedom in setting their requirements. However, scores such as the TGAT, TPAT, and A-Level Tests are usually required.

==== Round 3: Joint admissions ====
In this round, universities accept students with exam scores of TGAT, TPAT, and A-Level tests. Round 3 admissions are handled by the CUPT rather than the universities.

==== Round 4: Direct admissions ====
In round 4, universities have total freedom in setting their requirements and criteria. Universities can require scores in TGAT, TPAT, A-Level tests, or other exams such as the SAT, and IELTS. They can also require the student&#x27;s portfolio and set requirements of the student&#x27;s area of origin.

==== Admissions exams ====
Source:

The standardised exams universities generally accepted are as follows:

===== Thai General Aptitude Test or TGAT (replacing GAT in 2023) =====
The TGAT is divided into three sections:

* English communication
* Critical and Logical Thinking
* Future workforce competency

===== Thai Professional Aptitude Tests or TPAT (replacing PAT in 2023) =====
Presently, there are TPATs for five fields: medicine; liberal arts; science, technology, and engineering; architecture; and education.

* TPAT 1: Medical Aptitude Test (developed by the consortium of Thai medical schools)
* TPAT 2: Liberal arts Aptitude Test
* TPAT 3: Scientific, technological, and engineering Aptitude Test
* TPAT 4: Architecture Aptitude Test
* TPAT 5: Teaching and educational Aptitude Test

===== Applied Knowledge Level test or A-Level (replacing General Subject Tests in 2023) =====
These exams are intended to test a student&#x27;s knowledge of each subject and his/her ability to apply that knowledge. The A-Level include:

* Thai
* Social studies
* English
* Other foreign languages (replacing PAT 7 in 2023)
** French
** German
** Japanese
** Chinese
** Arabic
** Pali
** Korean
* Applied science
* Applied mathematics 1: Fundamental and Additional mathematics
* Applied mathematics 2: Fundamental mathematics
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Physics

==International schools==
The ministry of education defines international schools as, &quot;...an educational institution providing an international curriculum or international curriculum which its subject&#x27;s detail has been adjusted or a self-organised curriculum, which is not the Ministry of Education&#x27;s. A foreign language is used as the medium of teaching and learning and students are enrolled without restriction or limitation on nationality or religion or government regime, and are not against the morality or stability of Thailand.&quot;

Prior to 1992, only a very small number of international schools existed in Thailand, and they catered entirely to the children of expatriates, as Thai law prohibited Thai nationals from enrolling. When the first international school, International School Bangkok, relocated to a new campus outside of the city proper, a group of parents worked with United Nations staff to lobby the Ministry of Education to change this law and open the first new international school in decades. This led to the establishment of New International School of Thailand (later changed to NIST International School), and the repeal of the prohibition against the enrollment of Thais. Due to the high demand for private international education, this change also sparked the opening of dozens of other international schools in subsequent years.

The curriculum is required to be approved by the Ministry of Education and may be an international one, an international curriculum with modifications, or a curriculum established by the school itself. Thai language and culture constitutes a core subject and is mandatory at every level for all Thai students registered as Thai nationals. Thai nationals must study Thai for five 50-minute lessons per week, while non-Thai citizens are required to study Thai language and culture for one 50-minute lesson per week. International schools must operate within a framework of requirements and conditions established by the Ministry of Education, that stipulates the ownership, location and size of the plot, design and structure of buildings, ratio of students to classroom surface, sanitary installations, administration and educational support facilities such as libraries and resources centres. Within one year from their commencement, elementary and secondary schools must apply accreditation from an international organisation recognised and accepted by the Office of the Private Education Commission and accreditation must be granted within six years. The license holder, Manager and Thai Director must be of Thai nationality though frequently there will also be a foreign headteacher to oversee the international curriculum and implement school policy.

Approximately 90 international schools operate in Thailand, of which about two-thirds are in the Bangkok area.

==Distance learning by TV==
Established in 1996, DLTV (Distance Learning via TV) broadcasts 15 educational channels from Klai Kangwon Palace School, Hua Hin. It broadcasts via the Ku-band beam on the Thaicom 5 satellite to 17,000 schools and other subscribers across the country. In December 2008, Thaicom Public Company, the operator of the Thaicom satellite, announced it has renewed a 10-year contract with the Distance Learning Education via Satellite Foundation of Thailand (DLF) to broadcast DLTV channels using one Ku-band transponder on the Thaicom 5 satellite.

On 13 May 2020, The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission&#x27;s (NBTC) board approved the sequencing of 17 new digital TV channels for education run by the Education Ministry, channels 37-53, along with Thai PBS TV station using a frequency band to run an active learning TV programme on channel 4. These were planned to run on a temporary basis starting on 1 July 2020 and lasting for six months.

==Teacher development and performance==
In recent years, the number of fresh graduates from teacher-training schools has ranged from 50,000 to 60,000 annually, raising concerns about quality and oversupply. The government is trying to reduce the number of graduates from teacher-education programmes to no more than 25,000 a year and direct those graduates to underserved localities. &quot;We need to focus on quality, not quantity,&quot; a spokesperson said. In September 2015, the Office of the Higher Education Commission (OHEC) put forward an initiative to provide 58,000 grants to student-teachers over a 15-year period. The bulk of the grants would go to those who would be sent to work in areas with a shortage of teachers.

In 2010 the Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC), for the first time, tested secondary schools teachers on the subjects they teach. A grade of less than 59 per cent was considered to exhibit a low standard of knowledge. OBEC said up to 88 per cent of 3,973 computer science teachers failed the test. The same was true in biology (86 per cent of 2,846), math (84 per cent of 5,498), physics (71 per cent of 3,487), chemistry (64 per cent of 3,088) and astronomy and earth sciences (63 per cent of 529). Teachers at the junior high level earned higher marks. OBEC said 58 per cent of 14,816 teachers teaching math had marks of more than 80 per cent, while 54 per cent of 13,385 teachers did well in sciences. School directors did not fare well: about 95 per cent failed tests in information and computer technology and English.

Elementary and secondary school teachers do not enjoy the same long breaks as the students and are required to work through the vacations on administrative duties. They are also burdened with administrative tasks: a study by the Quality Learning Foundation found that Thai teachers spent 84 of the 200-day academic year performing non-teaching tasks such as undergoing unnecessary training, performing administrative duties, and hosting external evaluations.

On 24 January 2024, the Minister of Education Permpoon Chidchob announced that Thai teachers will no longer be forced to take turns staying on school campuses after school hours in what is known as &quot;teacher on duty&quot;. This follows the recent assault on a 41-year old female teacher on duty at Bang Pong Klua School in Chiang Rai province which caused several teacher associations to send petitions to the ministry to revoke the rule. The Office of the Basic Education Commission is also seeking cabinet approval to allow schools to rehire school janitors to reduce the amount of burdens placed on teachers following their phasing out.

==English language education==

Thai university applicants scored an average 28.34 per cent in English in recent university entrance exams. Thailand produces a &quot;workforce with some of the world&#x27;s weakest English-language skills.&quot; In a recent IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook Thailand was ranked 54th out of 56 countries globally for English proficiency. Singapore was third, Malaysia 28th and Korea 46th.

The government has long realised the importance of the English language as a core subject in schools, and it has been a compulsory subject at varying levels for several decades. Since 2005 schools are encouraged to establish bilingual departments where core subjects are taught in English as well as offering intensive English language programmes.

==Rural–urban and ethnic divides==
Place of birth is a significant marker for predicting academic success in Thailand. Students in ethnic minority areas, predominantly rural, score consistently lower in standardized national and international tests. Students from poor families living in remote areas face limited access to quality education compared to their urban counterparts. Only 50 per cent of Thai students are taught academic subjects in their home language.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEM-2017/8&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to unequal allocation of educational resources, weak teacher training, socio-economic factors (poverty), and lower ability in the central Thai language, the language of instruction and tests.

==Violence==
A third of Thai students aged 13 to 15 suffered bullying at school between 2010 and 2015. Twenty-nine per cent were victims of physical violence. School violence instigated by students at technical or vocational schools is an ongoing problem.

==Sex education==
Thai researcher Wichit Wongwarithip asserts that Thailand does not deliver on sex education. It fails with regard to gender diversity, gender equality, and safe sex. &quot;Society tends to think that &#x27;good morals&#x27; are the solutions to all problems and that Thai culture is the best,&quot; said Wichit. Thai sex education rests on the bedrock of the traditional values of heterosexuality and patriarchy. Instead of encouraging safe sex, Thai sex education tells schoolgirls to abstain until they are ready to form a family. Some Thai textbooks characterise masturbation as deviant behaviour and recommend meditation to suppress sexual desire. Jiraphon Arunakon, Director of the Gender Variation Clinic, says that sex education as taught in Thailand lags behind or ignores scientific research. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) removed homosexuality from the &quot;disease&quot; classification in 1990 and Thailand&#x27;s Ministry of Public Health asserted in 2002 that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. Parit Chiwarak, an education activist from Education for Liberation Network, says that students read their sex ed textbooks in order to pass exams, but do not take them seriously. &quot;We all know that Thai textbooks are...sexist...I don&#x27;t think that students nowadays perceive LGBT people as deviants. Students these days are not stupid. It&#x27;s self-destructive to write things that oppose ordinary people&#x27;s belief [sic] like this...&quot;, stated Parit.

Meanwhile, Thai sex education has done little to decrease Thailand&#x27;s high teenage pregnancy rate. In 2014, about 334 babies were born daily to mothers aged between 15 and 19. Teen births in Thailand have been on the rise. Of every 1,000 live births, 54 are from teen mothers aged 15–19, higher than in the US and 10 times higher than Singapore. The number of live births by Thai teenage mothers aged 15–18 increased 43 per cent between 2000 and 2011. The reasons for this may be societal norms. &quot;Women are told to protect their virginity but Thai men who have multiple sexual encounters are seen as cool,&quot; said Visa Benjamano, a commissioner at the National Human Rights Council (NHRC).

==Uniforms==

Uniforms are compulsory for all students with very few variations from the standard model throughout the public and private school systems, including colleges and universities.

University uniforms are standard throughout the country and consist of a white blouse and plain or pleated skirt for females, and long black trousers, a white long-sleeved shirt with a dark blue or black tie for males. Thammasat University is the first university in Thailand that broke the uniform stereotype by providing choice for students to wear a polite uniform as a result of the democracy movement in 1932. Cracks in the university uniform policy began to appear in 2018 as a result of student agitation. The Faculty of Arts at Chulalongkorn University (CU) abolished the compulsory uniform requirement. CU has long claimed that its student uniform is prestigious as it was bestowed upon CU students by King Rama V, the university&#x27;s founder. In Mahidol University (MU) which was founded in 1888 by Majesty King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) as Siriraj Hospital also has uniform requirement where students need to wear white shirt and The Mahidol University brooch is pinned on the right side of the shirt.

<doc id="550137" wikidata="Q427625" url="?curid=550137" title="Elliptic operator">
<text>In the theory of partial differential equations, elliptic operators are differential operators that generalize the Laplace operator. They are defined by the condition that the coefficients of the highest-order derivatives be positive, which implies the key property that the principal symbol is invertible, or equivalently that there are no real characteristic directions.

Elliptic operators are typical of potential theory, and they appear frequently in electrostatics and continuum mechanics. Elliptic regularity implies that their solutions tend to be smooth functions (if the coefficients in the operator are smooth). Steady-state solutions to hyperbolic and parabolic equations generally solve elliptic equations.

==Definitions==

Let formula_1 be a linear differential operator of order &quot;m&quot; on a domain formula_2 in R&quot;n&quot; given by
formula_3
where formula_4 denotes a multi-index, and formula_5 denotes the partial derivative of order formula_6 in formula_7.

Then formula_1 is called &quot;elliptic&quot; if for every &quot;x&quot; in formula_2 and every non-zero formula_10 in R&quot;n&quot;,
formula_11
where formula_12.

In many applications, this condition is not strong enough, and instead a &quot;uniform ellipticity condition&quot; may be imposed for operators of order &quot;m&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot;:
formula_13
where &quot;C&quot; is a positive constant. Note that ellipticity only depends on the highest-order terms.

A nonlinear operator
formula_14
is elliptic if its linearization is; i.e. the first-order Taylor expansion with respect to &quot;u&quot; and its derivatives about any point is an elliptic operator.

; Example 1: The negative of the Laplacian in R&quot;d&quot; given by formula_15 is a uniformly elliptic operator. The Laplace operator occurs frequently in electrostatics. If ρ is the charge density within some region Ω, the potential Φ must satisfy the equation formula_16
; Example 2: Given a matrix-valued function &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) which uniformly positive definite for every &quot;x&quot;, having components &quot;a&quot;&quot;ij&quot;, the operator formula_17 is elliptic. This is the most general form of a second-order divergence form linear elliptic differential operator. The Laplace operator is obtained by taking &quot;A&quot; = &quot;I&quot;. These operators also occur in electrostatics in polarized media.
; Example 3: For &quot;p&quot; a non-negative number, the p-Laplacian is a nonlinear elliptic operator defined by formula_18 A similar nonlinear operator occurs in glacier mechanics. The Cauchy stress tensor of ice, according to Glen&#x27;s flow law, is given by formula_19 for some constant &quot;B&quot;. The velocity of an ice sheet in steady state will then solve the nonlinear elliptic system formula_20 where &quot;ρ&quot; is the ice density, &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration vector, &quot;p&quot; is the pressure and &quot;Q&quot; is a forcing term.

==Elliptic regularity theorems==

Let &quot;L&quot; be an elliptic operator of order 2&quot;k&quot; with coefficients having 2&quot;k&quot; continuous derivatives. The Dirichlet problem for &quot;L&quot; is to find a function &quot;u&quot;, given a function &quot;f&quot; and some appropriate boundary values, such that &quot;Lu = f&quot; and such that &quot;u&quot; has the appropriate boundary values and normal derivatives. The existence theory for elliptic operators, using Gårding&#x27;s inequality, Lax–Milgram lemma and Fredholm alternative, states the sufficient condition for a weak solution &quot;u&quot; to exist in the Sobolev space &quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

For example, for a Second-order Elliptic operator as in Example 2, 
* There is a number &quot;γ&gt;0&quot; such that for each &quot;μ&gt;γ&quot;, each formula_21, there exists a unique solution formula_22 of the boundary value problemformula_23, which is based on Lax-Milgram lemma. 
* Either (a) for any formula_21, formula_25 (1) has a unique solution, or (b)formula_26 has a solution formula_27, which is based on the property of compact operators and Fredholm alternative.

This situation is ultimately unsatisfactory, as the weak solution &quot;u&quot; might not have enough derivatives for the expression &quot;Lu&quot; to be well-defined in the classical sense.

The &quot;elliptic regularity theorem&quot; guarantees that, provided &quot;f&quot; is square-integrable, &quot;u&quot; will in fact have &quot;2k&quot; square-integrable weak derivatives. In particular, if &quot;f&quot; is infinitely-often differentiable, then so is &quot;u&quot;.

For &quot;L&quot; as in Example 2, 
* Interior regularity: If &quot;m&quot; is a natural number, formula_28 (2) , formula_22 is a weak solution to (1), then for any open set &quot;V&quot; in &quot;U&quot; with compact closure, formula_30(3), where &quot;C&quot; depends on &quot;U, V, L, m&quot;, per se formula_31, which also holds if &quot;m&quot; is infinity by Sobolev embedding theorem.
* Boundary regularity: (2) together with the assumption that formula_32 is formula_33 indicates that (3) still holds after replacing &quot;V&quot; with &quot;U,&quot; i.e. formula_34, which also holds if &quot;m&quot; is infinity.

Any differential operator exhibiting this property is called a hypoelliptic operator; thus, every elliptic operator is hypoelliptic. The property also means that every fundamental solution of an elliptic operator is infinitely differentiable in any neighborhood not containing 0.

As an application, suppose a function formula_35 satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Since the Cauchy-Riemann equations form an elliptic operator, it follows that formula_35 is smooth.

== Properties ==
For &quot;L&quot; as in Example 2 on &quot;U&quot;, which is an open domain with &quot;C1&quot; boundary, then there is a number &quot;γ&quot;&gt;0 such that for each &quot;μ&quot;&gt;&quot;γ&quot;, formula_37 satisfies the assumptions of Lax–Milgram lemma.

* Invertibility: For each &quot;μ&quot;&gt;&quot;γ&quot;, formula_38 admits a compact inverse.
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: If &quot;A&quot; is symmetric, &quot;bi,c&quot; are zero, then (1) Eigenvalues of &quot;L&quot;, are real, positive, countable, unbounded (2) There is an orthonormal basis of &quot;L2(U)&quot; composed of eigenvectors of &quot;L&quot;. (See Spectral theorem.)
* Generates a semigroup on &quot;L2(U)&quot;: −&quot;L&quot; generates a semigroup formula_39 of bounded linear operators on &quot;L2(U)&quot; s.t. formula_40 in the norm of &quot;L2(U),&quot; for every formula_41, by Hille–Yosida theorem.

==General definition==

Let formula_42 be a (possibly nonlinear) differential operator between vector bundles of any rank. Take its principal symbol formula_43 with respect to a one-form formula_10. (Basically, what we are doing is replacing the highest order covariant derivatives formula_45 by vector fields formula_10.)

We say formula_42 is &quot;weakly elliptic&quot; if formula_43 is a linear isomorphism for every non-zero formula_10.

We say formula_42 is (uniformly) &quot;strongly elliptic&quot; if for some constant formula_51,
formula_52

for all formula_53 and all formula_54.

The definition of ellipticity in the previous part of the article is &quot;strong ellipticity&quot;. Here formula_55 is an inner product. Notice that the formula_10 are covector fields or one-forms, but the formula_54 are elements of the vector bundle upon which formula_42 acts.

The quintessential example of a (strongly) elliptic operator is the Laplacian (or its negative, depending upon convention). It is not hard to see that formula_42 needs to be of even order for strong ellipticity to even be an option. Otherwise, just consider plugging in both formula_10 and its negative. On the other hand, a weakly elliptic first-order operator, such as the Dirac operator can square to become a strongly elliptic operator, such as the Laplacian. The composition of weakly elliptic operators is weakly elliptic.

Weak ellipticity is nevertheless strong enough for the Fredholm alternative, Schauder estimates, and the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. On the other hand, we need strong ellipticity for the maximum principle, and to guarantee that the eigenvalues are discrete, and their only limit point is infinity.

<text>In mathematics, the braid group on strands (denoted formula_1), also known as the Artin braid group, is the group whose elements are equivalence classes of -braids (e.g. under ambient isotopy), and whose group operation is composition of braids (see ). Example applications of braid groups include knot theory, where any knot may be represented as the closure of certain braids (a result known as Alexander&#x27;s theorem); in mathematical physics where Artin&#x27;s canonical presentation of the braid group corresponds to the Yang–Baxter equation (see ); and in monodromy invariants of algebraic geometry.

==Introduction==
In this introduction let ; the generalization to other values of will be straightforward. Consider two sets of four items lying on a table, with the items in each set being arranged in a vertical line, and such that one set sits next to the other. (In the illustrations below, these are the black dots.) Using four strands, each item of the first set is connected with an item of the second set so that a one-to-one correspondence results. Such a connection is called a &quot;braid&quot;. Often some strands will have to pass over or under others, and this is crucial: the following two connections are &quot;different&quot; braids:


On the other hand, two such connections which can be made to look the same by &quot;pulling the strands&quot; are considered &quot;the same&quot; braid:


All strands are required to move from left to right; knots like the following are &quot;not&quot; considered braids:


Any two braids can be &quot;composed&quot; by drawing the first next to the second, identifying the four items in the middle, and connecting corresponding strands:


Another example:

The composition of the braids and is written as .

The set of all braids on four strands is denoted by formula_2. The above composition of braids is indeed a group operation. The identity element is the braid consisting of four parallel horizontal strands, and the inverse of a braid consists of that braid which &quot;undoes&quot; whatever the first braid did, which is obtained by flipping a diagram such as the ones above across a vertical line going through its centre. (The first two example braids above are inverses of each other.)

== Applications ==
Braid theory has recently been applied to fluid mechanics, specifically to the field of chaotic mixing in fluid flows. The braiding of (2 + 1)-dimensional space-time trajectories formed by motion of physical rods, periodic orbits or &quot;ghost rods&quot;, and almost-invariant sets has been used to estimate the topological entropy of several engineered and naturally occurring fluid systems, via the use of Nielsen–Thurston classification.

Another field of intense investigation involving braid groups and related topological concepts in the context of quantum physics is in the theory and (conjectured) experimental implementation of the proposed particles anyons. These may well end up forming the basis for error-corrected quantum computing and so their abstract study is currently of fundamental importance in quantum information.

==Formal treatment==
To put the above informal discussion of braid groups on firm ground, one needs to use the homotopy concept of algebraic topology, defining braid groups as fundamental groups of a configuration space. Alternatively, one can define the braid group purely algebraically via the braid relations, keeping the pictures in mind only to guide the intuition.

To explain how to reduce a braid group in the sense of Artin to a fundamental group, we consider a connected manifold formula_3 of dimension at least 2. The &quot;symmetric product&quot; of formula_4 copies of formula_3 means the quotient of formula_6, the formula_4-fold Cartesian product of formula_3 by the permutation action of the symmetric group on formula_4 strands operating on the indices of coordinates. That is, an ordered formula_4-tuple is in the same orbit as any other that is a re-ordered version of it.

A path in the formula_4-fold symmetric product is the abstract way of discussing formula_4 points of formula_3, considered as an unordered formula_4-tuple, independently tracing out formula_4 strings. Since we must require that the strings never pass through each other, it is necessary that we pass to the subspace formula_16 of the symmetric product, of orbits of formula_4-tuples of &quot;distinct&quot; points. That is, we remove all the subspaces of formula_6 defined by conditions formula_19 for all formula_20. This is invariant under the symmetric group, and formula_16 is the quotient by the symmetric group of the non-excluded formula_4-tuples. Under the dimension condition formula_16 will be connected.

With this definition, then, we can call the braid group of formula_3 with formula_4 strings the fundamental group of formula_16 (for any choice of base point – this is well-defined up to isomorphism). The case where formula_3 is the Euclidean plane is the original one of Artin. In some cases it can be shown that the higher homotopy groups of formula_16 are trivial.

===Closed braids=== 

When &quot;X&quot; is the plane, the braid can be &quot;closed&quot;, i.e., corresponding ends can be connected in pairs, to form a link, i.e., a possibly intertwined union of possibly knotted loops in three dimensions. The number of components of the link can be anything from 1 to &quot;n&quot;, depending on the permutation of strands determined by the link. A theorem of J. W. Alexander demonstrates that every link can be obtained in this way as the &quot;closure&quot; of a braid. Compare with string links.

Different braids can give rise to the same link, just as different crossing diagrams can give rise to the same knot. In 1935, Andrey Markov Jr. described two moves on braid diagrams that yield equivalence in the corresponding closed braids. A single-move version of Markov&#x27;s theorem, was published by in 1997.

Vaughan Jones originally defined his polynomial as a braid invariant and then showed that it depended only on the class of the closed braid.

The Markov theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closures of two braids are equivalent links.

=== Braid index ===
The &quot;braid index&quot; is the least number of strings needed to make a closed braid representation of a link. It is equal to the least number of Seifert circles in any projection of a knot.

==History==
Braid groups were introduced explicitly by Emil Artin in 1925, although (as Wilhelm Magnus pointed out in 1974) they were already implicit in Adolf Hurwitz&#x27;s work on monodromy from 1891.

Braid groups may be described by explicit presentations, as was shown by Emil Artin in 1947. Braid groups are also understood by a deeper mathematical interpretation: as the fundamental group of certain configuration spaces.

As Magnus says, Hurwitz gave the interpretation of a braid group as the fundamental group of a configuration space (cf. braid theory), an interpretation that was lost from view until it was rediscovered by Ralph Fox and Lee Neuwirth in 1962.

==Basic properties==

===Generators and relations===
Consider the following three braids:

Every braid in formula_2 can be written as a composition of a number of these braids and their inverses. In other words, these three braids generate the group formula_2. To see this, an arbitrary braid is scanned from left to right for crossings. Numbering the strands beginning at the top, whenever a crossing of strands formula_31 and formula_32 is encountered, formula_33 or formula_34 is written down, depending on whether strand formula_31 moves over or under strand formula_32. Upon reaching the right end, the braid has been written as a product of the formula_33 and their inverses.

It is clear that

::(i) formula_38,

while the following two relations are not quite as obvious:

::(iia) formula_39,
::(iib) formula_40

(these relations can be appreciated best by drawing the braid on a piece of paper). It can be shown that all other relations among the braids formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43 already follow from these relations and the group axioms.

Generalising this example to formula_4 strands, the group formula_1 can be abstractly defined via the following presentation:

:formula_46

where in the first group of relations formula_47 and in the second group of relations formula_48. This presentation leads to generalisations of braid groups called Artin groups. The cubic relations, known as the braid relations, play an important role in the theory of Yang–Baxter equations.

===Further properties===
* The braid group formula_49 is trivial, formula_50 is the infinite cyclic group formula_51, and formula_52 is isomorphic to the knot group of the trefoil knot – in particular, it is an infinite non-abelian group.
* The -strand braid group formula_1 embeds as a subgroup into the formula_54-strand braid group formula_55 by adding an extra strand that does not cross any of the first strands. The increasing union of the braid groups with all formula_56 is the infinite braid group formula_57.
* All non-identity elements of formula_1 have infinite order; i.e., formula_1 is torsion-free.
*There is a left-invariant linear order on formula_1 called the Dehornoy order.
* For formula_61, formula_1 contains a subgroup isomorphic to the free group on two generators.
* There is a homomorphism formula_63 defined by . So for instance, the braid is mapped to . This map corresponds to the abelianization of the braid group. Since , then is the identity if and only if formula_64. This proves that the generators have infinite order.

==Interactions==

===Relation with symmetric group and the pure braid group===
By forgetting how the strands twist and cross, every braid on strands determines a permutation on elements. This assignment is onto and compatible with composition, and therefore becomes a surjective group homomorphism from the braid group onto the symmetric group. The image of the braid σ&quot;i&quot; ∈ is the transposition . These transpositions generate the symmetric group, satisfy the braid group relations, and have order 2. This transforms the Artin presentation of the braid group into the Coxeter presentation of the symmetric group:

:formula_65

The kernel of the homomorphism is the subgroup of called the pure braid group on strands and denoted . This can be seen as the fundamental group of the space of -tuples of distinct points of the Euclidean plane. In a pure braid, the beginning and the end of each strand are in the same position. Pure braid groups fit into a short exact sequence

: formula_66

This sequence splits and therefore pure braid groups are realized as iterated semi-direct products of free groups.

===Relation between B3 and the modular group===
The braid group formula_52 is the universal central extension of the modular group formula_68, with these sitting as lattices inside the (topological) universal covering group

:formula_69.

Furthermore, the modular group has trivial center, and thus the modular group is isomorphic to the quotient group of formula_52 modulo its center, formula_71 and equivalently, to the group of inner automorphisms of formula_52.

Here is a construction of this isomorphism. Define

:formula_73.

From the braid relations it follows that formula_74. Denoting this latter product as formula_75, one may verify from the braid relations that

:formula_76

implying that formula_75 is in the center of formula_52. Let formula_79 denote the subgroup of formula_52 generated by , since , it is a normal subgroup and one may take the quotient group . We claim ; this isomorphism can be given an explicit form. The cosets and map to

:formula_81

where and are the standard left and right moves on the Stern–Brocot tree; it is well known that these moves generate the modular group.

Alternately, one common presentation for the modular group is

:formula_82

where

:formula_83

Mapping to and to yields a surjective group homomorphism .

The center of is equal to , a consequence of the facts that is in the center, the modular group has trivial center, and the above surjective homomorphism has kernel .

===Relationship to the mapping class group and classification of braids===
The braid group can be shown to be isomorphic to the mapping class group of a punctured disk with punctures. This is most easily visualized by imagining each puncture as being connected by a string to the boundary of the disk; each mapping homomorphism that permutes two of the punctures can then be seen to be a homotopy of the strings, that is, a braiding of these strings.

Via this mapping class group interpretation of braids, each braid may be classified as periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov.

===Connection to knot theory===
If a braid is given and one connects the first left-hand item to the first right-hand item using a new string, the second left-hand item to the second right-hand item etc. (without creating any braids in the new strings), one obtains a link, and sometimes a knot. Alexander&#x27;s theorem in braid theory states that the converse is true as well: every knot and every link arises in this fashion from at least one braid; such a braid can be obtained by cutting the link. Since braids can be concretely given as words in the generators , this is often the preferred method of entering knots into computer programs.

=== Computational aspects ===
The word problem for the braid relations is efficiently solvable and there exists a normal form for elements of in terms of the generators . (In essence, computing the normal form of a braid is the algebraic analogue of &quot;pulling the strands&quot; as illustrated in our second set of images above.) The free GAP computer algebra system can carry out computations in if the elements are given in terms of these generators. There is also a package called &quot;CHEVIE&quot; for GAP3 with special support for braid groups. The word problem is also efficiently solved via the Lawrence–Krammer representation.

In addition to the word problem, there are several known hard computational problems that could implement braid groups, applications in cryptography have been suggested.

==Actions==
In analogy with the action of the symmetric group by permutations, in various mathematical settings there exists a natural action of the braid group on -tuples of objects or on the -folded tensor product that involves some &quot;twists&quot;. Consider an arbitrary group and let be the set of all -tuples of elements of whose product is the identity element of . Then acts on in the following fashion:

: formula_84

Thus the elements and exchange places and, in addition, is twisted by the inner automorphism corresponding to – this ensures that the product of the components of remains the identity element. It may be checked that the braid group relations are satisfied and this formula indeed defines a group action of on . As another example, a braided monoidal category is a monoidal category with a braid group action. Such structures play an important role in modern mathematical physics and lead to quantum knot invariants.

===Representations===
Elements of the braid group can be represented more concretely by matrices. One classical such representation is Burau representation, where the matrix entries are single variable Laurent polynomials. It had been a long-standing question whether Burau representation was faithful, but the answer turned out to be negative for . More generally, it was a major open problem whether braid groups were linear. In 1990, Ruth Lawrence described a family of more general &quot;Lawrence representations&quot; depending on several parameters. In 1996, Chetan Nayak and Frank Wilczek posited that in analogy to projective representations of , the projective representations of the braid group have a physical meaning for certain quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall effect. Around 2001 Stephen Bigelow and Daan Krammer independently proved that all braid groups are linear. Their work used the Lawrence–Krammer representation of dimension formula_85 depending on the variables and . By suitably specializing these variables, the braid group formula_1 may be realized as a subgroup of the general linear group over the complex numbers.

==Infinitely generated braid groups==
There are many ways to generalize this notion to an infinite number of strands. The simplest way is to take the direct limit of braid groups, where the attaching maps formula_87 send the formula_88 generators of formula_89 to the first formula_88 generators of formula_55 (i.e., by attaching a trivial strand). This group, however, admits no metrizable topology while remaining continuous.

Paul Fabel has shown that there are two topologies that can be imposed on the resulting group each of whose completion yields a different group. The first is a very tame group and is isomorphic to the mapping class group of the infinitely punctured disk—a discrete set of punctures limiting to the boundary of the disk.

The second group can be thought of the same as with finite braid groups. Place a strand at each of the points formula_92 and the set of all braids—where a braid is defined to be a collection of paths from the points formula_93 to the points formula_94 so that the function yields a permutation on endpoints—is isomorphic to this wilder group. An interesting fact is that the pure braid group in this group is isomorphic to both the inverse limit of finite pure braid groups formula_95 and to the fundamental group of the Hilbert cube minus the set
:formula_96

==Cohomology==
The cohomology of a group formula_97 is defined as the cohomology of the corresponding Eilenberg–MacLane classifying space, formula_98, which is a CW complex uniquely determined by formula_97 up to homotopy. A classifying space for the braid group formula_1 is the th unordered configuration space of formula_101, that is, the space of all sets of formula_4 distinct unordered points in the plane: 
:formula_103.
So by definition

The calculations for coefficients in formula_104 can be found in Fuks (1970).

Similarly, a classifying space for the pure braid group formula_95 is formula_106, the th &quot;ordered&quot; configuration space of formula_101. In 1968 Vladimir Arnold showed that the integral cohomology of the pure braid group formula_95 is the quotient of the exterior algebra generated by the collection of degree-one classes formula_109, subject to the relations
:formula_110

<text>Mike Cowlishaw is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. and sometime visiting professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick. He is a retired IBM Fellow, and was a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology, and the British Computer Society. He was educated at Monkton Combe School and the University of Birmingham.

==Career at IBM==
Cowlishaw was a pre-University student in 1971 and joined IBM in 1974 as an electronic engineer but is best known as a programmer and writer. He is known for designing and implementing the Rexx programming language (1984), his work on colour perception and image processing that led to the formation of JPEG (1985), the STET folding editor (1977), the LEXX live parsing editor with colour highlighting for the Oxford English Dictionary (1985), electronic publishing, SGML applications, the IBM Jargon File &quot;IBMJARG&quot; (1990), a programmable OS/2 world globe &quot;PMGlobe&quot; (1993), &quot;MemoWiki&quot; based on his &quot;GoServe&quot; Gopher/http server, and the Java-related NetRexx programming language (1997).

He has contributed to various computing standards, including ISO (SGML, COBOL, C, C++), BSI (SGML, C), ANSI (REXX), IETF (HTTP 1.0/RFC 1945), W3C (XML Schema), ECMA (JavaScript/ECMAScript, C#, CLI), and IEEE (754 decimal floating-point). He retired from IBM in March 2010.

===Decimal arithmetic===
Cowlishaw has worked on aspects of decimal arithmetic; his proposal for an improved Java BigDecimal class (JSR 13) is now included in Java 5.0, and in 2002, he invented a refinement of Chen–Ho encoding known as densely packed decimal encoding. Cowlishaw&#x27;s decimal arithmetic specification formed the proposal for the decimal parts of the IEEE 754 standard, as well as being followed by many implementations, such as Python and SAP NetWeaver. His decNumber decimal package is also available as open source under several licenses and is now part of GCC, and his proposals for decimal hardware have been adopted by IBM and others. They are integrated into the IBM POWER6 and IBM System z10 processor cores, and in numerous IBM software products such as DB2, TPF (in Sabre), WebSphere MQ, operating systems, and C and PL/I compilers.

==Other activities==
Cowlishaw wrote an emulator for the Acorn System 1, and collected related documentation. Outside computing, he caved in the UK, New England, Spain, and Mexico
 and continues to cave and hike in Spain. He is a life member of the National Speleological Society (NSS), wrote articles in the 1970s and 1980s on battery technology and on the shock strength of caving ropes, and designed LED-based caving lamps.
His current programming projects include MapGazer. and PanGazer

<text>Julian Baltazar Józef Marchlewski (17 May 1866 – 22 March 1925) was a Polish communist politician, revolutionary activist and publicist who served as chairman of the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee. He was also known under the aliases Karski and Kujawiak.

==Life and career==
Julian Marchlewski was born in Włocławek, which was then under Russian rule, to a Polish Catholic father and a German Protestant mother, both of whom were of noble origin. There was no tradition of political dissent in his family. As a student in Warsaw he joined a Marxist group called The Proletariat. After completing high education in 1885, he sought employment as a weaver or dyer, in factories in Poland and Germany. He returned to Poland, and in 1889, he co-founded the Polish Workers&#x27; Union, with Adolf Warski and Bronisław Wesołowski, which focused on the immediate needs of Polish workers, such as pay and working conditions. Arrested in 1891, after the government moved in to end a wave of strikes by Polish workers, he spent a year in prison, in Warsaw. After his release in 1892, he emigrated to Switzerland and joined Rosa Luxemburg and Leo Jogiches in co-founding the Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP) (later renamed the SDPKiL after a merger with a small Polish-Lithuanian Marxist party led by Felix Dzerzhinsky). In 1896, he received a doctorate from Zurich University, after which he settled in Dresden, in Germany, where he and Alexander Parvus launched a newspaper, &quot;Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung&quot;, which they edited until they were both expelled from Saxony, in September 1898. They moved to Munich, where they ran a publishing venture.

Marchlewski returned to Russian-occupied Poland, after 13 years abroad, during the Russian Revolution of 1905 in the Polish territories. Early in 1906, the SDPKiL sent him to Belgium to buy weapons. In June, he and Dzerzhinsky presided over the Fifth SDPKiL congress, in Zakopane, where they decided to affiliate with the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), which was split between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, and to align with Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Late in 1906, he was arrested, but the police could not establish who he was, and he was released early in 1907. In May 1907, he part of the SDPKiL delegation at the London Congress of the RSDLP, and was elected an alternate member of the Central Committee. 

After the failure of the 1905 revolution, Marchlewski returned to Germany, where he lived semi-illegally for nine years. His partnership with Parvus as it emerged that Parvus&#x27;s management had bankrupted their publishing venture. He worked as a journalist writing for newspapers run by the German Social Democratic Party until September 1913 when, as acting editor of &quot;Leipziger Volkszeitung&quot;, he was barred by the party from publishing an article by Rosa Luxemburg. He broke off relations with the SDP leadership, which he believed had become &#x27;revisionist&#x27; - i.e. no longer revolutionary. In December 1913, he launched a new journal, &quot;Sozialdemokratische Korrespondenz&quot;, using his flat as the editorial office, with himself, Rosa Luxemburg and Franz Mehring as the regular contributors. On the outbreak of war in 1914, he joined the small anti-war group within the SDP, led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, originally known as &quot;Gruppe Internationale&quot;, later as Spartakusbund, the forerunner of the German Communist Party. Marchlewski was arrested in January 1916, and was in a German prison during the Russian Revolution, but was released in June 1918 as part of a prisoner exchange that followed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and was deported to Russia, where he joined the Bolsheviks. He was named as a Soviet diplomatic representative first in Vienna, and in October his name was put forward as the first soviet ambassador in Poland, but never took up either post, because neither the Austrians nor the Poles recognsied the soviet regime, and instead stayed in Russia organising Polish communists.

In January 1919, he returned to Berlin illegally, after being refused entry at the German border, to help found the German Communist Party, and was dispatched to the Ruhr. After Liebknecht and Luxemburg had been murdered, in Berlin, he noticed that police were trailing him, and in disguise he joined a group of agricultural workers who were heading home to Galicia, which was now in Poland. Arriving there in March, he made contact with Józef Piłsudski, Commander in Chief of the Polish army. By pointing that the heads of the White Army, who were seeking to overthrow the Bolsheviks, had no intention of recognising Poland&#x27;s independence, he persuaded Piłsudski to recognise him as a go-between to negotiate a settlement between Poland the Soviet Union. Returning to Moscow in June, he secured Lenin&#x27;s support, but ran up against angry opposition from exiled leaders of the Polish communist party. His first attempt to conduct negotiations, in July 1919, was a failure, and included his being roughed by Polish soldiers at the border. He crossed the border again in August, as head of a Soviet Red Cross mission, with &quot;bowler hat, wing-collar and a Gladstone bag&quot;, but again the talks broke down in December. In July 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, Marchlewski was appointed Chairman of the Polish Provisional Revolutionary Committee (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Rewolucyjny Polski&quot;) in Białystok, implying that he would have been head of the Polish government had the Red Army won the war, though real power would probably have bene exercised by Dzerzhinsky, nominally his deputy.

In autumn 1921, Marchlewski was sent on a long diplomatic mission to China. He returned in June 1922. He was the first rector of the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West. As an economist, he was an expert in agriculture and took part in the preparation of the Bolshevik program with respect to the peasantry. Marchlewski also wrote scientific and theoretical works on history, philosophy and culture. He died near Nervi, Italy in 1925 during a vacation.

His body was returned to Poland, where he was interred at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw. His daughter Sonja was the second wife of the artist Heinrich Vogeler and his younger brother was the chemist Leon Marchlewski.

==Legacy==

In 1926, he was the namesake for the Polish National Raion in Ukraine (Marchlewszczyzna), with the capital at Marchlewsk (known before and after as Dovbysh and Shchorsk; a similar Polish district of Dzierżyńszczyzna, named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, was in Belarus).
Warsaw&#x27;s Jan Paweł II Street was formerly called Marchlewski Street.

Panzerregiment 23 &quot;Julian Marchlewski&quot;, part of the 9th Panzer Division of the Land Forces of the National People&#x27;s Army, was named in his honor. The regiment disbanded along with the entire National People&#x27;s Army when Germany reunified in 1990.

<text>Floyd Council (September 2, 1911 – May 9, 1976) was an American blues guitarist, mandolin player, and singer. He was a practitioner of the Piedmont blues, which was popular in the southeastern United States in the 1920s and 1930s. He was sometimes credited as Dipper Boy Council and promoted as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daddy-in-Law&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States, to Harrie and Lizzie Council, he began his musical career on the streets of Chapel Hill in the 1920s, performing with two brothers, Leo and Thomas Strowd, as the Chapel Hillbillies. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he and Blind Boy Fuller busked in the Chapel Hill area. Council recorded twice for ARC at sessions with Fuller in the mid-1930s, all examples of the Piedmont style.

Council married Pearly Mae Farrington, daughter of Libert and Annie Farrington of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Council suffered a stroke in the late 1960s, which partially paralyzed his throat muscles and slowed his motor skills, but did not significantly damage his cognitive abilities. The folklorist Peter B. Lowry attempted to record him one afternoon in 1970, but Council never regained his singing or playing abilities. Accounts say that he remained sharp in mind.

Council died in 1976 of a heart attack, after moving to Sanford, North Carolina. He was buried at White Oak AME Zion Cemetery in Sanford.

In 2014, the Killer Blues Headstone Project placed a headstone for Floyd Council.

==The Floyd in Pink Floyd==
Syd Barrett, of the English psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd, created the band&#x27;s name by juxtaposing the first names of Council and South Carolina bluesman Pink Anderson, having noticed the names in the liner notes of a 1962 album by Blind Boy Fuller (Philips BBL-7512), written by the blues historian Paul Oliver: &quot;Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, ... Pink Anderson or Floyd Council—these were a few amongst the many blues singers that were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys.&quot;

==Discography==
No records are available which exclusively feature Council&#x27;s work. The CD &quot;Carolina Blues&quot; features six songs he recorded: &quot;I&#x27;m Grievin&#x27; and I&#x27;m Worryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want No Hungry Woman&quot;, &quot;Lookin&#x27; for My Baby&quot;, &quot;Poor and Ain&#x27;t Got a Dime&quot;, &quot;Runaway Man Blues&quot; and &quot;Working Man Blues&quot;.

In a 1969 interview, Council stated he had recorded 27 songs over his career, seven of them backing Blind Boy Fuller. Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Complete Recorded Works&quot; contains many songs with Council playing guitar.

<text>Satipatthana (; ) is a central practice in the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, meaning &quot;the establishment of mindfulness&quot; or &quot;presence of mindfulness&quot;, or alternatively &quot;foundations of mindfulness&quot;, aiding the development of a wholesome state of mind. In Theravada Buddhism, applying mindful attention to four domains, the body, feelings, the mind, and key principles or categories of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching (&quot;dhammās&quot;), is thought to aid the elimination of the five hindrances and the development of the seven aspects of wakefulness.

The &quot;Satipatthana Sutta&quot; is probably the most influential meditation text in modern Theravada Buddhism, on which the teachings of the Vipassana movement are based. While these teachings are found in all Buddhist traditions, modern Theravada Buddhism and the Vipassana Movement are known especially for promoting the practice of satipaṭṭhāna as developing mindfulness to gain insight into impermanence, thereby reaching a first state of liberation. In the popular understanding, mindfulness has developed into a practice of bare awareness to calm the mind.
==Etymology==
======
 is a compound term that has been parsed (and thus translated) in two ways, namely &#x27; and &#x27;. The separate terms can be translated as follows:
* &quot;Sati&quot; – Pali; Sanskrit smṛti. &quot;Smṛti&quot; originally meant &quot;to remember&quot;, &quot;to recollect&quot;, &quot;to bear in mind&quot;, as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred text; the term &quot;sati&quot; also means &quot;to remember&quot;. According to Sharf, in the &quot;Satipațțhāna-sutta&quot; the term &quot;sati&quot; means to remember the wholesome dhammās, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen, such as the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the attainment of insight. Usually, &quot;sati&quot; is interpreted as observing and watching various phenomena or domains of experience, being aware and attentive of them in the present moment. 
* &quot;&quot; (Sanskrit: upasthāna) – &quot;attendance, waiting on, looking after, service, care, ministering&quot;
* &quot;&quot; – &quot;setting forth, putting forward&quot;; in later Buddhist literature also &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;starting point&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;.

The compound terms have been translated as follows: 
*&quot;&quot; – &quot;presence of mindfulness&quot; or &quot;establishment of mindfulness&quot; or &quot;arousing of mindfulness&quot;, underscoring the mental qualities co-existent with or antecedent to mindfulness.
*&quot;&quot; – &quot;foundation of mindfulness&quot;, underscoring the object used to gain mindfulness.

While the latter parsing and translation is more traditional, the former has been given etymological and contextual authority by contemporary Buddhist scholars such as Bhikkhu Analayo and Bhikkhu Bodhi.

Anālayo argues from an etymological standpoint that, while &quot;foundation [&#x27;] of mindfulness&quot; is supported by the Pāli commentary, the term &#x27; (foundation) was otherwise unused in the Pāli nikayas and is only first used in the Abhidhamma. In contrast, the term &#x27; (presence or establishment) can in fact be found throughout the nikayas and is readily visible in the Sanskrit equivalents of the compound Pāli phrase &#x27; (Skt., &#x27; or &#x27;). Thus Anālayo states that &quot;presence of mindfulness&quot; (as opposed to &quot;foundation of mindfulness&quot;) is more likely to be etymologically correct.

Like Anālayo, Bodhi assesses that &quot;establishment [] of mindfulness&quot; is the preferred translation. However, Bodhi&#x27;s analysis is more contextual than Anālayo&#x27;s. According to Bodhi, while &quot;establishment of mindfulness&quot; is normally supported by the textual context, there are exceptions to this rule, such as with SN 47.42 where a translation of &quot;foundation of mindfulness&quot; is best supported. Soma uses both &quot;foundations of mindfulness&quot; and &quot;arousing of mindfulness.&quot;
The term &quot;sati&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;smṛti&quot;), which is often translated as mindfulness, also means memory and recollection, and it is often used in that sense in the early discourses, which sometimes define &quot;sati&quot; as &quot;the ability of calling to mind what has been done or said long ago.&quot; According to Sharf, in the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot;, the term &quot;sati&quot; means to remember the dharmas, which allows one to see the true nature of phenomena.

According to Anālayo, sati does not literally mean memory, but &quot;that which facilitates and enables memory.&quot; This is particularly applicable in the context of satipaṭṭhāna, in which sati does not refer to remembering past events, but an &quot;awareness of the present moment&quot;, and to remember to stay in that awareness (especially if one&#x27;s attention wanders away). Anālayo states that it is this clear and awake state of presence that allows one to easily remember whatever is experienced. He also states that sati is a detached, uninvolved and non-reactive observation which does not interfere with what it is observing (such an active function is instead associated with right effort, not mindfulness). This allows one to clearly attend to things in a more sober, objective and impartial manner. Regarding &quot;upaṭṭhāna,&quot; Anālayo writes that it means &quot;being present&quot; and &quot;attending&quot; in this context. He further states: &quot;Understood in this way, &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; means that sati &quot;stands by&quot;, in the sense of being present; sati is &quot;ready at hand&quot;, in the sense of attending to the current situation. Satipaṭṭhāna can then be translated as &quot;presence of mindfulness&quot; or as &quot;attending with mindfulness.&quot;

Paul Williams (referring to Frauwallner) states that satipaṭṭhāna practice refers to &quot;constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.&quot;

Rupert Gethin, who argues that satipaṭṭhāna is derived from &quot;sati&quot;+&quot;upaṭṭhāna&quot;, sees satipaṭṭhāna as &quot;the activity of observing or watching the body, feelings, mind and dhammas,&quot; as well as &quot;a quality of mind that &#x27;stands near&#x27;&quot; (the literal meaning of &quot;upaṭṭhāna&quot;) or &quot;serves&#x27; the mind,&quot; and even &quot;presence of mind&quot;. Gethin further notes that sati (&#x27;mindfulness&#x27;) refers to &quot;remembering&quot; or &quot;having in mind&quot; something. It is keeping something in mind without wavering or losing it.

Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that sati is &quot;a presence of mind, attentiveness or awareness&quot; as well as &quot;&quot;bare attention&quot;, a detached observation of what is happening within us and around us in the present moment [...] the mind is trained to remain in the present, open, quiet, alert, contemplating the present event.&quot; He also states that sati is &quot;what brings the field of experience into focus and makes it accessible to insight.&quot; According to Bodhi, to be mindful, &quot;all judgements and interpretations have to be suspended, or if they occur, just registered and dropped.&quot;

Bhante Gunaratana explains &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; practice as bringing full awareness to our present moment bodily and mental activities.

According to Sujato, mindfulness is &quot;the quality of mind which recollects and focuses awareness within an appropriate frame of reference, bearing in mind the what, why, and how of the task at hand.&quot;

==Textual accounts==

===Early Buddhist texts===
In the Pāli Tipitaka, the four satipaṭṭhānas are found throughout the &#x27; (SN, Chapter 47) which contains 104 of the Buddha&#x27;s discourses on the &#x27;. Other saṁyuttas in SN also deal with satipaṭṭhāna extensively, such as the &quot;Anuruddha-saṁyutta&quot;. They can also be found in the &quot;&quot; (MN 10), as well as in DN 22 which is mostly the same with the addition of the four noble truths. 

The Sarvāstivāda Saṃyukta Āgama (SĀ, Taisho Tripitaka #99) contains an entire section devoted to smṛtyupasthāna, which parallels the Pali &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna-samyutta.&quot; According to Sujato, the Sarvāstivāda &quot;Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra&quot; seems to emphasize samatha or calm abiding, while the Theravadin version emphasizes vipassana or insight. 

The Chinese Tripitaka also contains two parallels to the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna sutta&quot;; Madhyama Āgama (MĀ) No. 98 (belonging to the Sarvāstivāda) and the Ekottara Āgama 12.1, &quot;Ekāyana Sūtra&quot; (possibly from the Mahāsaṅghika school). Their presentation of the satipaṭṭhāna formula has some significant differences with the Theravada version. For example, MĀ 98 lists the four jhanas and the &#x27;perception of light&#x27; under mindfulness of the body as well as listing six elements instead of four. However they generally share the same structure and several basic practices.

=== Scholastic and Abhidhamma texts ===
The four satipaṭṭhāna are analyzed and systematized in the scholastic and Abhidharma works of the various Buddhist schools. In these later texts, various doctrinal developments can be seen. The satipaṭṭhānas can be found in the &quot;Vibhaṅga&quot; (a book of the Theravada &quot;Abhidhamma Pitaka&quot;) in a form which differs from that in the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.&quot; According to Johannes Bronkhorst and Bhikkhu Sujato, the satipaṭṭhāna formulation in the &quot;Vibhaṅga&quot; is actually an earlier version of the formula (it includes fewer elements than the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot;). The Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma text called the &quot;Dharmaskandha&quot; also contains a passage with the smṛtyupasthāna schema. According to Sujato, this is very similar to the passage from the &quot;Vibhaṅga&quot;. The &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot;, an Abhidharma text of the Dharmaguptaka school, also contains a passage with the smṛtyupasthānas.

In his history of satipaṭṭhāna, Bhikkhu Sujato writes that:
In the early teachings satipaṭṭhāna was primarily associated not with vipassanā but with samatha. Since for the Suttas, samatha and vipassanā cannot be divided, a few passages show how this samatha practice evolves into vipassanā. In later literature the vipassanā element grew to predominate, almost entirely usurping the place of samatha in satipaṭṭhāna.

Tse-fu Kuan agrees, noting that &quot;the tendency to dissociate satipaṭṭhāna from samatha is apparently a rather late development.&quot; According to Sujato, various canonical texts which show sectarian Theravada elements consistently depict satipaṭṭhāna as more closely aligned with vipassanā practice. However, in the canonical Abhidhamma, satipaṭṭhāna is still said to be associated with jhana as well. For example, according to Kuan, the Vibhanga &quot;says that when a monk attains the first jhāna and contemplates the body (feelings, etc.) as a body (feelings, etc.), at that time sati, anussati, etc. are called &#x27;satipaṭṭhāna.&#x27;&quot; Meanwhile, the canonical Abhidharma texts of the Sarvāstivāda tradition consistently interpreted the &quot;smṛtyupasthānas&quot; as being a practice that was associated with samadhi and dhyana. This can be seen in the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra,&quot; which contains a section on how to practice the &quot;smṛtyupasthānas&quot; in the context of the four dhyanas and the formless attainments.

In the later texts of the Theravada tradition, like the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, the focus on vipassanā is taken even further. Some of these works claim that one may reach awakening by practicing dry insight meditation (vipassanā without jhana) based on satipaṭṭhāna. Through this practice, one is said to be able to reach a &quot;transcendental jhana&quot; which lasts for one mind moment prior to realization. According to Sujato this is a &quot;grave distortion of the suttas&quot;.

The same kind of trend can be seen in some later, post-canonical Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma works, such as the &quot;Abhidharmasāra&quot; of Dharmaśrī. This text, unlike the canonical Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, treats the four &quot;smṛtyupasthānas&quot; as mainly vipassanā practices. This presentation influenced later works like the &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; (4th century CE), which &quot;defines satipaṭṭhāna not as ‘mindfulness’, but as ‘understanding’ (&quot;paññā&quot;).&quot; However, this practice is only undertaken after having practiced samādhi based on ānāpānasati or contemplation of the body and so is not equivalent to the dry insight approach of the later Theravada.&quot;&quot;

===Mahayana texts===
Mahayana Buddhist texts also contain teachings on the four &quot;smṛtyupasthānas.&quot; These include the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra,&quot; Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya,&quot; the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot;, Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Madhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya&quot;, the &quot;Avataṁsaka Sūtra&quot;, and Santideva&#x27;s &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya.&quot; Furthermore, Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Letter to a Friend&quot; contains a passage which affirms the early Buddhist understanding of the four &quot;smṛtyupasthānas&quot; as closely connected with samādhi: &quot;he persevering practice (of &quot;smṛtyupasthāna&quot;) is called ‘samādhi’.&quot; Another parallel passage of the satipaṭṭhāna schema can be found in the &quot;Pañcavimsatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā sutra&quot;. Another passage is found in the &quot;Śrāvakabhūmi.&quot;

=== Elements in the early texts ===
The various early sources for satipaṭṭhāna provide an array of practices for each domain of mindfulness. Some of these sources are more elaborate and contain more practices than others. The table below contains the main elements found in the various early Buddhist sources on the satipaṭṭhānas.

Various scholars have attempted to use the numerous early sources to trace an &quot;ur-text&quot; i.e. the original satipaṭṭhāna formula or the earliest sutta. Bronkhorst (1985) argues that the earliest form of the satipaṭṭhāna sutta only contained the observation of the impure body parts under mindfulness of the body, and that mindfulness of dhammas was originally just the observation of the seven awakening factors. Sujato&#x27;s reconstruction similarly only retains the contemplation of the impure under mindfulness of the body, while including only the five hindrances and the seven awakening factors under mindfulness of dhammas. According to Analayo, mindfulness of breathing was probably absent from the original scheme, noting that one can easily contemplate the body&#x27;s decay taking an external object, that is, someone else&#x27;s body, but not be externally mindfull of the breath, that is, someone else&#x27;s breath. 

== Connection with other Buddhist teachings ==

===Gradual training===
The satipaṭṭhānas are one of the seven sets of &quot;states conducive to awakening&quot; (Pāli &quot;bodhipakkhiyādhammā&quot;) identified in many schools of Buddhism as means for progressing toward &quot;bodhi&quot; (awakening). The early sources also contain passages in which the Buddha is said to refer to satipaṭṭhāna as a path which is &quot;ekā-yano&quot; for purification and the realisation of nirvana. The term ekāyano has been interpreted and translated in different ways including &quot;the only path&quot; (Soma), &quot;direct path,&quot; (Analayo, B. Bodhi), &quot;path to convergence&quot; i.e. to samādhi (Sujato) and the &quot;comprehensive&quot; or &quot;all-inclusive&quot; path where all practices converge (Kuan). According to Sujato, in the context of the graduated path to awakening found in numerous early texts, the practice of the satipaṭṭhānas is closely connected with various elements, including sense restraint, moderate eating, wakefulness, clear comprehension, seclusion, establishing mindfulness and abandoning the hindrances.

The place of satipaṭṭhāna in the gradual training is thus outlined by Sujato as follows: 
Johannes Bronkhorst has argued that in the early texts there are two kinds of mindfulness, the preliminary stage of &quot;mindfulness in daily life&quot; (often called clear comprehension) and the practice of mindfulness meditation proper (the actual practice of satipaṭṭhāna as a formal meditation). According to Sujato, these two forms of mindfulness are so closely connected that they gradually came to be subsumed under the heading of satipaṭṭhāna.

===Jhana===
In the schema of the Noble Eightfold Path, they are included in &quot;sammā-sati&quot; (right mindfulness), which culminates in the final factor of the path, &quot;sammā-samādhi&quot; (a state of luminous awareness, but also interpreted as deep meditative absorption). This is confirmed by texts like MN 44.12 which state &quot;the four satipaṭṭhānas are the basis for samādhi.&quot; The close connection between satipaṭṭhāna and samādhi can also be seen in texts which discuss the three trainings (such as MN 44.11/MA 210) which list satipaṭṭhāna under samādhi. Thus, according to Bhikkhu Sujato, &quot;all of the basic statements on the function of satipaṭṭhāna in the path confirm that its prime role is to support samādhi, that is, jhāna.&quot; Rupert Gethin also affirms the close connection between satipaṭṭhāna and the jhanas, citing various discourses from the Pali Nikayas (such as SN 47.10 and SN 47.8).

In the oldest texts of Buddhism, &quot;dhyāna&quot; (Sanskrit) or &quot;jhāna&quot; (Pāḷi) is the training of the mind, commonly translated as meditation, to withdraw the mind from the automatic responses to sense-impressions, and leading to a &quot;state of perfect equanimity and awareness (&quot;upekkhā-sati-parisuddhi&quot;).&quot; &quot;Dhyāna&quot; may have been the core practice of pre-sectarian Buddhism, in combination with several related practices which together lead to perfected mindfulness and detachment, and are fully realized with the practice of &quot;dhyana&quot;. In the later commentarial tradition, which has survived in present-day Theravāda, &quot;dhyāna&quot; is equated with &quot;concentration,&quot; a state of one-pointed absorption in which there is a diminished awareness of the surroundings. Since the 1980s, scholars and practitioners have started to question this equation, arguing for a more comprehensive and integrated understanding and approach, based on the oldest descriptions of &quot;dhyāna&quot; in the &quot;sutta&quot;s.

According to Anālayo, writing from a more traditional perspective, &quot;several discourses testify to the important role of &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; as a basis for the development of absorption&quot; (jhana). This includes suttas like the &quot;Dantabhūmi Sutta&quot; and the &quot;Cūḷavedalla Sutta&quot; (which speaks of &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; as the “cause” of &quot;samādhi&quot;, &quot;samādhinimitta&quot;). Anālayo also writes that &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; is not purely a concentration (&quot;samādhi&quot;) exercise, noting that sati &quot;represents an enhancement of the recollective function,&quot; in which the breadth of attention is expanded. During absorption, &quot;sati becomes mainly presence of the mind,&quot; but in a more focused way.

Anālayo cites SN 47.10 in which the Buddha states that if one is distracted and sluggish while practicing &quot;satipaṭṭhāna,&quot; one should switch one&#x27;s meditation towards a calm (&quot;samatha&quot;) meditation, in order to cultivate joy and serenity. Once the mind has been calmed, one can then return to &quot;satipaṭṭhāna.&quot; Anālayo argues that the distinction that is made in this sutta between “directed” and “undirected” forms of meditation suggest that &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; is not the same as samatha meditation. However, the sutta also shows that they are closely interrelated and mutually supporting.

Thanissaro Bhikkhu, citing various early sources (SN 47:40, MN 118, AN 4:94, AN 4:170, Dhp 372 etc.), similarly states that &quot;developing the frames of reference [&quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot;] is a precondition for jhana&quot; and that &quot;the proper development of the frames of reference necessarily incorporates, in and of itself, the practice of jhana.&quot;

== As four domains of mindfulness==

===The four domains===
In the early Buddhist texts, mindfulness is explained as being established in four main ways: 
# mindfulness of the body (Pāli: &quot;kāyagatā-sati&quot;; Skt. &quot;kāya-smṛti&quot;), 
# mindfulness of feelings (Pāli &quot;vedanā-sati&quot;; Skt. &quot;vedanā-smṛti&quot;), 
# mindfulness of the mind (Pāli &quot;citta-sati&quot;; Skt. &quot;citta-smṛti&quot;) 
# mindfulness of principles or phenomena (Pāli &quot;dhammā-sati&quot;; Skt. &quot;dharma-smṛti&quot;).

Rupert Gethin translates (from the Pali) the basic exposition of these four practices (which he calls the &quot;basic formula&quot;) that is shared by numerous early Buddhist sources as follows: 
According to Grzegorz Polak, the four &quot;upassanā&quot; have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four &quot;upassanā&quot; do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the &quot;jhanas&quot;, describing how the &quot;samskharas&quot; are tranquilized:
* the six sense-bases which one needs to be aware of (&quot;kāyānupassanā&quot;); 
* contemplation on vedanās, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (&quot;vedanānupassanā&quot;);
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the five hindrances to the seven factors of enlightenment (&quot;dhammānupassanā&quot;).

=== Mindfulness of the body ===
The various early sources show considerable variation in the practices included under mindfulness of the body. The most widely shared set of meditations are the contemplation of the body&#x27;s anatomical parts, the contemplation of the elements, and the contemplation of a corpse in decay. Anālayo notes that the parallel versions of the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot; &quot;agree not only in listing these three exercises, but also in the sequence in which they are presented.&quot; According to Sujato&#x27;s comparative study of satipaṭṭhāna, the original mindfulness of the body practice focused on contemplating various parts of the body, while the other practices later came to be added under mindfulness of the body.

====Body parts====
The practice of mindfulness of anatomical parts is described in the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot; as follows: &quot;&quot;&quot;one examines this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, enclosed by skin and full of many kinds of impurity.&quot; Following this instruction is a list of various body parts, including hair, skin, teeth, numerous organs as well as different kinds of bodily liquids. According to Anālayo, this meditation, which is often called the meditation on &quot;asubha&quot; (the unattractive), is supposed to deconstruct notions of bodily beauty and to allow us to see that bodies are &quot;not worth being attached to&quot; (as the &quot;Ekottarika-āgama&quot; version states). Ultimately, according to Anālayo, &quot;the principal aim of contemplating the anatomical constitution of the body is the removal of sensual desire.&quot; Sujato similarly states that the basic purpose of these three meditations &quot;is to rise above sensuality,&quot; and to deprive &quot;the addiction to sensual gratification&quot; of its fuel.

According to U Sīlānanda, first one should memorize the 32 parts of the body by reciting them, then one learns the color, shape and location of each part. After achieving mastery in this, one is ready to contemplate the unattractiveness of each part in meditation. Bhikkhu Bodhi notes that this practice is done &quot;using visualization as an aid.&quot; This practice is described with a common simile in the early discourses: one is mindful of each body part in the same way one is mindful when looking through various kinds of beans (or grains) in a bag (i.e. in a detached way). This indicates that the goal is not to become disgusted with the body but to see it in a detached manner. Bhante Gunaratana similarly notes that this practice &quot;opens the mind to accepting our body as it is right now, without our usual emotional reactions. It helps us overcome pride and self-hatred and regard our body with the balanced mind of equanimity.&quot; Similarly, Thanissaro Bhikkhu argues that this practice, far from creating a negative self-image, allows us to develop a healthy understanding of the reality that all bodies are equal (and thus none is superior or inferior in terms of beauty, since such a concept is ultimate relative to one&#x27;s frame of reference).

====Elements====
The practice of mindfulness of the elements or properties mainly focuses on four physical attributes (&quot;mahābhūta&quot;): earth (solids), water (liquids), air (gases moving in and outside the body, as well as breathing) and fire (warmth/temperature). The early texts compare this to how a butcher views and cuts up a slaughtered cow into various parts. According to Anālayo this second exercise focuses on diminishing the sense of identification with the body and thus, on seeing anatta (not-self) and undoing the sense of ownership to the body. Buddhaghosa states that through this practice a monk &quot;immerses himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of living beings.&quot; The practice of contemplating these four properties is also described in more detail in the &quot;Mahāhaṭṭthipadopama Sutta,&quot; the &quot;Rāhulovāda Sutta,&quot; and the &quot;Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta&quot;.

====Corpse====

The practice of mindfulness of death is explained as contemplating a corpse various progressive stages of decay (from a fresh corpse to bone dust). According to Anālayo, the sources indicate that the practice could have been done in a charnel ground with real corpses but also indicate that one may visualize this as well. Bodhi writes that this practice can be done in the imagination, through using pictures or by viewing an actual formerly living human corpse.

The various early sources all indicate that one should contemplate how one&#x27;s own body is of the same nature as the corpse. The &quot;Ekottarika-āgama&quot; version states that one is to contemplate how &quot;my body will not escape from this calamity&quot;, &quot;I will not escape from this condition. My body will also be destroyed,&quot; and &quot;this body is impermanent, of a nature to fall apart.&quot; This practice allows one to gain insight into our own impermanence, and therefore also leads to letting go. In numerous early sources, contemplating the inevitability of death is also said to lead to increased motivation to practice the path.

====Overall direction====
Anālayo sums up the overall direction of mindfulness of the body as &quot;detachment from the body through understanding its true nature.&quot; The early discourses compare mindfulness of the body to a strong pillar which can be used to tie up numerous wild animals (which are compared to the six senses). This simile shows that mindfulness of the body was seen as a powerful centering practice and as a strong anchor for maintaining the guarding of the senses. The Kāyagatāsati-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama parallel also list various others benefits from practicing mindfulness of the body, including how it helps to give rise to mental balance and detachment and allows one to endure many physical discomforts.

=== Mindfulness of feelings ===
This satipaṭṭhāna focuses on the contemplation of &quot;feelings&quot; (&quot;vedanā&quot;, affect, valence or hedonic tones), which mainly refers to how one perceives feelings as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. According to Anālayo, mindfulness of feelings &quot;requires recognizing the affective tone of present-moment experience, before the arisen feeling leads to mental reactions and elaborations.&quot; It also requires that &quot;one does not get carried away by the individual content of felt experience and instead directs awareness to the general character of experience.&quot; The early discourses contain similes which compare feelings to various types of &quot;fierce winds that can suddenly arise in the sky&quot; as well as to &quot;various types of people who stay in a guest house.&quot; These similes illustrate the need to remain calm and non-reactive in respect to feelings.

In most early sources, feelings are also distinguished between those which are sensual or worldly (lit. &quot;carnal&quot;) and those that are not sensual or spiritual in nature. This introduces an ethical distinction between feelings that can lead to the arising of defilements and those that lead in the opposite direction.&quot; Thus, while pleasant feelings associated with sense pleasures lead to unwholesome tendencies, pleasant feelings associated with mental concentration lead towards wholesome states. Meanwhile, a worldly painful feeling might lead to the arising of unwholesome mental states, but it need not do so if one is mindfully aware of it without reacting. Furthermore, certain painful feelings, like those caused by the sadness of knowing one has not yet reached liberation, are considered spiritual unpleasant feelings and can motivate one to practice more. As such, they are commendable.

The &quot;Madhyama-āgama&quot; version of the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot; also adds the additional categories of bodily and mental feelings, which refers to feelings that arise either from physical contact or from the mind (a distinction which does appear in other early discourses like the &quot;Salla-sutta&quot; SN 36.6 and its parallels). Furthermore, according to Sujato, the &quot;Ānāpānasati Sutta&quot; section on &quot;vedanā&quot; also adds &quot;rapture&quot; and &quot;mental activities&quot; (&quot;cittasankhāra&quot;, feeling and perception), which &quot;seems to broaden the scope of feelings here as far as ‘emotions’, ‘moods’.&quot; Gunaratana similarly states that &quot;vedanā&quot; &quot;includes both physical sensations and mental emotions.&quot;

Furthermore, Anālayo argues that &quot;the central role that feelings have in this respect is particularly evident in the context of the dependent arising (&quot;paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;) of dukkha, where feeling forms the crucial link that can trigger the arising of craving.&quot; The fact that dependent origination can be contemplated through mindfulness of feelings is supported by SĀ 290. The early discourses also state that practicing mindfulness of feeling can be a way of dealing with physical pain and disease.

Bhikkhu Bodhi notes that feelings arise due to sense contact (&quot;phassa&quot;) and thus another way of analyzing feeling is into six types depending on the six sense bases: eye, nose, tongue, ear, body, and mind.

=== Mindfulness of the mind ===
In all early sources, the contemplation of the mind or cognition (&quot;citta&quot;) begins with noticing the presence or absence of the three unwholesome roots (lust, anger, and delusion). This practice is similar to that found in other early discourses in which the Buddha looks into his mind by applying a basic distinction between wholesome and unwholesome thoughts (and reflecting how unwholesome thoughts are harmful, which allows him to abandon them). This can be seen in the &quot;Dvedhāvitakka-sutta&quot; and its parallels such as MĀ 102. Other suttas like the &quot;Vitakkasaṇṭhāna-sutta&quot; and its parallels, provide several ways of dealing with unwholesome thoughts, such as replacing an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one or contemplating the drawbacks of unwholesome thoughts.

Reflecting on the absence of unwholesome states is also important, as it allows one to rejoice in this positive state and become inspired by it. It also encourages one to protect this mental state, as can be seen in the simile of the bronze dish found in the &quot;Anaṅgaṇa-sutta&quot; (MN 5) and its parallels such as EĀ 25.6. In this simile, a person who buys a bronze dish but takes no care to clean it from time to time is compared to someone who is unaware of having a mind free of unwholesome states. In this case, the dish (mind) will eventually get dirty. In the other hand, someone who has reached some degree of purity and is mindful of this is more likely to protect and maintain this mental state.

Anālayo writes that this way of contemplating the mind is a middle path that avoids two extremes: one extreme is seeing only what is bad within oneself and consequently getting frustrated, succumbing to feelings of inadequacy. As a result of this, inspiration can get lost and one no longer engages fully in the practice. The other extreme is pretending to oneself (and in front of others) that one is better than one really is, at the cost of ignoring one&#x27;s own dark sides, those areas of the mind that are in need of purification. Such ignoring allows those dark sides to gather strength until they are able to overwhelm the mind completely. Steering a balanced middle path between these two extremes becomes possible through the simple but effective element of honest recognition, introduced through mindfulness of the present condition of one&#x27;s mind, which sees both one&#x27;s shortcomings and one&#x27;s virtues equally well. This mindfulness is also extended into being aware of the level of mindfulness (or distraction) and concentration present in the mind (from contraction or a lesser mind to higher states such as samadhi and liberation). Anālayo states that the basic task here is &quot;recognizing the degree to which one&#x27;s practice has developed and realizing if more can be done.&quot;

Therefore, the terms such as a &quot;small&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;contracted&quot; or &quot;distracted&quot; mind indicate a mind which lacks development in the qualities of mindfulness and samadhi. Other terms such as the &quot;developed,&quot; &quot;exalted&quot; and &quot;liberated&quot; mind are referring to a mind that has achieved some level of samadhi and mindfulness (and in some cases, has been at least temporarily liberated from the hindrances through meditation). Sujato states that the terms associated with higher states of mind refer to the jhanas (he cites MN 54.22–24, MN 53.20–22 as support). Anālayo further notes that this element of contemplation of the mind shows that in early Buddhism &quot;enquiring if one has reached some degree of attainment is considered an integral part of knowing the nature of one&#x27;s own mental condition.&quot;

In the early discourses (SĀ 1246 and AN 3.100), the gradual process of removing unwholesome thoughts and cultivating wholesome mental states is compared to the gradual refining of gold ore which is initially covered over with rock, sand and fine dust (which represent the various gross and subtle aspects of mental defilement).

===Mindfulness of dhammas===

==== Five hindrances and seven aspects of wakefulness ====
This last set of exercises show considerable variation in the various early Buddhist sources. Only two sets of dhammas (&quot;principles&quot; or &quot;mental categories&quot;) are shared by all early sources: the five hindrances and the seven factors of awakening, and Anālayo considers these two as integral elements of the fourth satipaṭṭhāna. Sujato&#x27;s comparative study concludes that these two groups of dhammas constituted the original subjects of meditation in this satipaṭṭhāna, while the other elements are later additions. Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that it is not possible to decide the question of what the original version may have been, but he concludes that there is a good case for stating that &quot;the early tradition regarded the abandoning of the hindrances and the development of the factors for Awakening as encompassing all the factors that might be included under this heading.&quot;

==== Dhamma ====
&quot;Dhammā&quot; is often translated as &quot;mental objects&quot; but Anālayo argues that this translation is problematic for multiple reasons. The three prior &quot;satipatthāna&quot; (body, sensations, mind) can become mental objects in themselves, and those objects, such as the hindrances, aggregates and sense bases, identified under the term &quot;dhamma&quot; are far from an exhaustive list of all possible mental objects. Anālayo translates &quot;dhammā&quot; as &quot;mental factors and categories,&quot; &quot;classificatory schemes,&quot; and &quot;frameworks or points of reference to be applied during contemplation&quot;. Thanissaro Bhikkhu argues that the fourth satipaṭṭhāna &quot;denotes the qualities of mind that are developed and abandoned as one masters the meditation.&quot;

Sujato argues that &quot;dhammā&quot; here refers to a &quot;distinctive and more profound aspect of meditation: the understanding of the causal principles underlying the development of samādhi.&quot; According to Anālayo, this satipaṭṭhāna focuses on phenomena which lead to awakening when cultivated and therefore, it is soteriologically oriented. Anālayo states that the &quot;main thrust&quot; of the fourth satipaṭṭhāna is the path to awakening and therefore, &quot;contemplation of dharmas is somewhat like a shorthand description of the path.&quot; He further adds that &quot;the task of mindfulness in the context of contemplation of dharmas would thus be to supervise the mind on the path to awakening, ensuring that the hindrances are overcome and the awakening factors are well established.&quot;

==== Five hindrances ====
According to U Sīlānanda, a proponent of the New Burmese method, the five hindrances are those mental states that hinder or block the mind&#x27;s progress to deeper concentration and liberation. In the early discourses (see MN 43.20, MN 68.6), the attainment of jhana is associated with the abandonment of the five hindrances, which are said to &quot;choke the mind, robbing understanding of its strength&quot;. Through the simile of refining gold, the early discourses state that as long as the hindrances have not been removed &quot;the mind is not soft, nor workable, nor radiant, but is brittle&quot; (AN 5.13).

The &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna sutta&quot; indicates that one is to be mindful of the presence or absence of each of the five hindrances (sense desire, ill will, sloth-and-torpor, restlessness-and-worry and doubt). The sutta and the MA parallel also state that one should know how a hindrance arises, how it can be removed and how it can be prevented from arising. The fact that mindfulness of the hindrances is also connected to remembering the instructions on how to remove and prevent the hindrances (not just watch it mindfully) is supported by other early discourses like the &quot;Gopakamoggallāna-sutt&quot;a and its parallels (like MĀ 145). Anālayo thus sees this practice as twofold: the receptive mode of just being aware of the hindrances and the more active mode of understanding how the hindrance arises and how it can be abandoned through a skillful deployment of right effort.

According to U Sīlānanda, various hindrances can arise from inappropriate attention/reflection (&quot;ayoniso manasikāra&quot;) and that proper or wise attention (&quot;yoniso manasikāra&quot;) can prevent their arising. Another way to prevent their arising is simply to be mindful of the hindrances. Various early discourses like SĀ 715 provide specific instructions on how to weaken and counter the hindrances. Desire is said to be countered with the contemplation of unattractiveness, ill will is countered with loving-kindness, sloth-torpor is countered with energetic thoughts or perceiving light (or being in a well lit place), restlessness-worry is countered with thoughts that bring calmness and doubt can be countered by contemplating dependent origination or contemplating what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. Suttas like the &quot;Saṅgārava-sutta&quot; mention that one benefit of removing the hindrances is an increased ability to learn and to remember what one has learned. The suttas also state that being mindful of the absence of the hindrances leads to joy, an important element of meditation.

==== Seven factors of awakening ====
The other main contemplation shared by all versions of the &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; formula is mindfulness of the seven factors of awakening (&quot;satta bojjhaṅgā&quot;). The contemplation is similar to that of the hindrances. First, one is aware of the presence or absence of each of these factors. Then one also contemplates how these factors arise, how they can be maintained and how they can be further developed, that is to say, one develops an &quot;awareness to the conditions that are related to their presence or absence.&quot;

Early sources such as SĀ 729 and SN 46.27 state that one cultivates these awakening factors &quot;supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, and supported by cessation, culminating in letting go.&quot; This indicates that a successful cultivation of these factors leads to awakening if they each one is cultivated while being supported by three elements: seclusion from unwholesome actions, dispassion as the fading away of craving, and the gradual cessation of dukkha.

The awakening factors are positive qualities associated with wisdom that stand in opposition to the hindrances (associated with darkness and lack of wisdom, see SN 46.40 and SĀ 706). The &quot;Aggi-sutta&quot; and its parallel at SĀ 714 indicate that particular awakening factors (investigation of dhammas, energy, joy) can be used as antidotes to sluggishness while other factors (tranquillity, concentration, equanimity) are antidotes for agitation. This does not work the other way around, that is to say, awakening factors that are useful against agitation are not useful to cultivate when one is sluggish and vice versa. The awakening factor of mindfulness meanwhile is useful in all circumstances. Indeed, according to Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda, &quot;mindfulness stands in the middle and orders the other faculties, here too it comes to the forefront and marshals those factors that are behind it.&quot;

Furthermore, the hindrance of doubt is also countered by the factor of investigation. When all hindrances are absent, one is then able to cultivate all seven factors at once. SĀ 718 and SN 46.4 indicate that mastering the awakening factors requires learning how to make use of each one of them in different circumstances. These suttas illustrate this with the simile of a king that dresses in various clothes throughout the day according to his needs.

Various discourses including SĀ 715 and SN 46.51 discuss how the seven awakening factors are to be nourished and developed. For example, mindfulness is nourished by the four &quot;satipaṭṭhānas,&quot; investigation is nourished by distinguish wholesome things from unwholesome things, and energy is nourished through the four right efforts.

Furthermore, according to the &quot;Anāpānasati-sutta&quot; and its Saṃyukta-āgama parallel, the sequence in which the factors are listed seems to correspond to how they unfold through practice. According to Analayo, &quot;this sequence reflects an underlying progression in which the factor mentioned earlier supports the arising of the factor that comes next.&quot; However, this progression is not a strict one. Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda states that &quot;it does not mean that one has to develop the first category first and then after a time the next category and so on. But still there is a certain order in the development – an ascending order, one may say.&quot;

==Practice==

===Process view===
According to Sujato, Satipaṭṭhāna is &quot;a prescription of how to practice,&quot; which &quot;introduces certain specific objects of meditation.&quot; Likewise, according to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, the &quot;four frames of reference&quot; (&quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot;) are &quot;a set of teachings that show where a meditator should focus attention and how.&quot;

Anālayo and Sujato both note that these four meditation subjects provide a progressive refinement of contemplation from coarse elements (the body) to increasingly subtler and more refined subjects. Likewise, Gethin writes that there is &quot;a movement from clear awareness of the more immediately accessible realms of experience to an awareness of what the Nikayas see as subtler and deeper realms.&quot;

However, Anālayo also argues that this pattern &quot;does not prescribe the only possible way of practising satipaṭṭhāna,&quot; since this would &quot;severely limit the range of one&#x27;s practice.&quot; This is because, &quot;a central characteristic of satipaṭṭhāna is awareness of phenomena as they are, and as they occur. Although such awareness will naturally proceed from the gross to the subtle, in actual practice it will quite probably vary from the sequence depicted in the discourse.&quot; Anālayo sees the four satipaṭṭhānas as flexible and mutually supportive practices. Therefore, according to Anālayo &quot;the sequence in which they are practised may be altered in order to meet the needs of each individual meditator.&quot; All four may even be combined into a single practice, as documented by the &quot;Ānāpānasati Sutta&quot;.

Thanissaro Bhikkhu argues that an element of mindfulness practice includes learning how to maximize skillful qualities and how to minimize unskillful qualities, which might require one to &quot;manipulate and experiment&quot; with different mental qualities and meditation methods. Therefore, Thanissaro argues that mindfulness meditation can also be an active process of learning various skillful ways of directing the mind by cultivating certain perceptions and ideas (such as asubha). Thanissaro compares this process to how &quot;one learns about eggs by trying to cook with them, gathering experience from one&#x27;s successes and failures in attempting increasingly difficult dishes.&quot; Eventually, as one gains mastery of the mind, one is able to transcend even the need for skillful manipulation of mental qualities.

=== Practice instructions ===
The &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot; states that one first goes to a secluded place, like a forest or an empty hut. U Sīlānanda states that a place away from human habitation and the noises of towns and cities is the most suitable place for &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot; meditation.

The definition of how one practices satipaṭṭhāna in the early texts uses the term &quot;anupassanā&quot; which refers to &quot;sustained observation&quot; of each subject of meditation. Anālayo defines this term which is derived from the verb “to see” (&quot;passati&quot;) as meaning “to repeatedly look at”, that is, “to contemplate” or “to closely observe.” Furthermore, he interprets this as referring to &quot;a particular way of meditation, an examination of the observed object from a particular viewpoint&quot; which &quot;emphasize how the object is to be perceived&quot; (such as seeing the body as unattractive or impermanent for example). Thanissaro translates &quot;anupassanā&quot; as &quot;remaining focused&quot; and “keeping track,” which &quot;denotes the element of concentration in the practice, as one tries to stay with one particular theme in the midst of the welter of experience.&quot;

All versions of the &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot; also indicate that each satipaṭṭhāna is to be contemplated first &quot;internally&quot; (&quot;ajjhatta&quot;), then &quot;externally&quot; (&quot;bahiddhā&quot;), and finally both internally and externally. This is generally understood as observing oneself and observing other persons, an interpretation which is supported by Abhidharma works (including the &quot;Vibhaṅga&quot; and the &quot;Dharmaskandha&quot;) as well as by several suttas (MN 104, DĀ 4, DĀ 18 and DN 18). Others interpret this passage as referring to mental (internal) phenomena and to phenomena associated with the senses (external), which according to Anālayo, does have some support from the suttas.

According to Gethin, the passage refers to observing ourselves and other persons: &quot;the bhikkhu, then, first watches his own body, feelings, mind and dhammas, next those of others, and finally his own and those of others together.&quot; One example which indicates how this is to be understood is the practice of death meditation, which can be done in a charnel ground by looking at dead bodies (external contemplation) and also by contemplating the death of one&#x27;s own body (internal). According to Gethin, this practice leads to &quot;the blurring of distinctions between self and other&quot; which arises as one begins to understand the world as being made up of impermanent and insubstantial processes. Anālayo concurs, stating that this contemplation can lead to the abandoning of the boundary between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;other&quot;, &quot;leading to a comprehensive vision of phenomena as such, independent of any sense of ownership.&quot;

Regarding the question of how one is supposed to observe the feelings and mental states of other people, Anālayo argues that one can cultivate this by &quot;carefully observing their outer manifestations&quot; since feelings and mental states do influence the facial expression, tone of voice, and physical posture. He cites suttas such as DN 28 as evidence that the early discourses hold that one may infer the mental state of others by watching their external manifestations. Anālayo also notes that balancing internal and external contemplation is important because it can prevent a one sided awareness focused on one domain (self-centredness or lack of introspection respectively). Balancing both fields of mindfulness can thus &quot;achieve a skilful balance between introversion and extroversion.&quot;

Thanissaro Bhikkhu outlines how all the different elements of mindfulness meditation come together as follows:“Mindful” (satima) literally means being able to remember or recollect. Here it means keeping one&#x27;s task in mind. The task here is a dual one—remaining focused on one&#x27;s frame of reference [satipaṭṭhāna], and putting aside the distractions of greed and distress that would come from shifting one&#x27;s frame of reference back to the world. In other words, one tries to stay with the phenomenology of immediate experience, without slipping back into the narratives and world views that make up one&#x27;s sense of the world. In essence, this is a concentration practice, with the three qualities of ardency, alertness, and mindfulness devoted to attaining concentration. Mindfulness keeps the theme of the meditation in mind, alertness observes the theme as it is present to awareness, and also is aware of when the mind has slipped from its theme. Mindfulness then remembers where the mind should be focused, and ardency tries to return the mind to its proper theme—and to keep it there—as quickly and skillfully as possible. In this way, these three qualities help to seclude the mind from sensual preoccupations and unskillful mental qualities, thus bringing it to the first jhana.

=== Auxiliary qualities ===
In the early texts, the satipaṭṭhānas are said to be practiced with specific mental qualities. This is listed in the Pali version in what Sujato calls the &quot;auxiliary formula&quot; which states that one contemplates (&quot;anupassī&quot;) each satipaṭṭhāna with the following four qualities: ardency or diligence (&quot;ātāpī&quot;), clear comprehension (&quot;sampajāna&quot;), mindfulness (&quot;sati&quot;), and &quot;free from desires and discontent (&quot;vineyya abhijjhādomanassa&quot;)&quot; (with some variation across the different sources). In many of the alternative forms of the auxiliary formula, samādhi is mentioned as the result of the practice (e.g. in DN 18.26/DA 4 and in SN 47.8/SA 616).

The term &quot;ātāpī&quot; is associated with the concept of tapas (ascetic power) and it is said to be related to heroic strength, effort or energy (&quot;viriya&quot;) in the &quot;Nettipakarana&quot;. It is thus associated with skillful effort and wholesome desire or resolve. It is best understood as a &quot;balanced but sustained application of energy&quot; according to Anālayo. Thanissaro Bhikkhu defines it as &quot;the factor of effort or exertion...which contains an element of discernment in its ability to distinguish skillful from unskillful mental qualities.&quot; U Sīlānanda glosses &quot;ātāpī&quot; as &quot;you must be energetic, put forth effort to be mindful.&quot;

The second quality, &quot;sampajāna,&quot; means to know something clearly or thoroughly so that one has &quot;the ability to fully grasp or comprehend what is taking place&quot;. This can refer to basic forms of knowing (such being aware of one&#x27;s posture) as well as more discriminative forms of understanding (such as comprehending the five hindrances). According to Thanissaro, this &quot;means being clearly aware of what is happening in the present.&quot;

According to Gethin, &quot;having removed covetousness and aversion for the world&quot; is associated with the abandoning of the five hindrances as well as with the attainment of the jhanas as can be seen in suttas like MN 125 which directly associate these elements of the path. According to U Sīlānanda, this passage refers to a temporary removal of the five hindrances as a preliminary for meditation.&quot; The &quot;Ekottarika-āgama&quot; version states that one practices satipaṭṭhāna while &quot;removing evil thoughts and being free from worry and sorrow, one experiences joy in oneself.&quot; Anālayo also associates this element with the development of &quot;samādhi.&quot; This is supported by the &quot;Nettippakarana&quot; (Nett 82) as well as by various suttas which contain a variation of the auxiliary formula which explicitly mentions samadhi such as SN 47.4).

Anālayo also notes that the abandonment of covetousness and aversion is associated with the practice of restraint of the senses in the early discourses (such as in MN 39). This is a stage of practice prior to formal meditation, in which &quot;the meditator guards the sense doors in order to prevent sense impressions from leading to desires and discontent.&quot; The goal in the initial stages of practice is to develop a sense of &quot;inner equipoise within which desires and discontent are held at bay.&quot; Anālayo further notes that &quot;although sense-restraint precedes proper meditation practice in the gradual path scheme, this does not imply that sense-restraint is completed at an exact point in time, only after which one moves on to formal practice. In actual practice the two overlap to a considerable degree.&quot; Likewise, Sujato associates this element with &quot;the preliminary subduing&quot; of the five hindrances through sense restraint to prepare the mind for mindfulness meditation.

=== Contemplation of impermanence ===
The Theravada &quot;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta&quot;, as well as the Ekottarika-āgama version preserved in Chinese contain instructions to contemplate the arising and disappearance of the meditation subject (i.e. impermanence, &quot;anicca&quot;). The Madhyama-āgama version does not contain this instruction, but does mention that on practicing mindfulness &quot;one is endowed with knowledge, vision, understanding, and penetration.&quot; Sujato thinks that this instruction to practice contemplation of impermanence reflects a later sectarian development that began to associate satipaṭṭhāna more closely with vipassanā. Analayo on the other hand thinks that contemplation of impermanence (&quot;aniccasaññā&quot;) &quot;should be considered an integral aspect of satipaṭṭhāna practice.&quot; He cites the &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; and the &quot;Ānāpānasati-sutta&quot; (and its parallels) as other sources which indicate that contemplation of impermanence is a part of satipaṭṭhāna practice.

Furthermore, Anālayo states that awareness of impermanence (which is an aspect of right view) also leads to insight into anatta and dukkha. Gethin notes that the practice of observing the arising and falling of phenomena is &quot;particularly associated with the gaining of the insight that leads directly to the destruction of the asavas, directly to awakening.&quot; He also notes how various other suttas state that the practice of the four &quot;satipaṭṭhānas&quot; are directly linked with the destruction of the asavas&quot;.&quot;

==Influence==

===Modern Theravāda===
The four satipaṭṭhānas are regarded as fundamental in modern Theravāda Buddhism and the Vipassana or Insight Meditation Movement. In the Pali Canon, mindfulness meditation and satipaṭṭhāna are seen as ways to develop the mental factors of &quot;samatha&quot; (&quot;calm&quot;, &quot;serenity&quot;) and vipassana (&quot;insight&quot;).

According to Bhikkhu Sujato, there is a particularly popular interpretation of mindfulness meditation in modern Theravāda which he calls the &quot;vipassanāvāda&quot; (the vipassanā-doctrine). According to Sujato, this widespread modernist view can be summarized as follows: The Buddha taught two systems of meditation, samatha and vipassanā. Samatha was taught before the Buddha (so is not really Buddhist), it is dangerous (because one can easily get attached to the bliss), and it is unnecessary (because vipassanā alone can develop the access samādhi necessary to suppress the hindrances). Vipassanā is the true key to liberation taught by the Buddha. This method was pre-eminently taught in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the most important discourse taught by the Buddha on meditation and on practice in everyday life. The essence of this practice is the moment-to-moment awareness of the rise and fall of all mind-body phenomena. Thus satipaṭṭhāna and vipassanā are virtually synonyms.Tse-fu Kuan also writes that it is a &quot;widely held opinion in Theravada Buddhism that serenity meditation is not essential for the realization of Nirvana&quot;. Kuan cites Theravada authors such as Ven. Rahula, Ven. Silananda and Nyanaponika as figures who support some version of this view. In contrast to this, Kuan argues that &quot;there is probably no explicit indication in the Canon that one can achieve liberation by the practice of sati alone without the attainment of the jhānas.&quot;

According to Kuan, this &quot;bare insight&quot; view arose due to &quot;the tendency in the tradition to redefine “liberation by wisdom” (&quot;paññāvimutt&quot;i) as being liberated by insight alone without high meditative attainments, although “liberation by wisdom” originally did not mean so.&quot; That liberation by wisdom did not originally mean liberation without jhana has also been argued by Cousins and Gombrich.

Anālayo writes that certain modern Theravada meditation teachers &quot;emphasize the “dry insight” approach, dispensing with the formal development of mental calm.&quot; He writes that some teachers of this dry insight approach describe the practice of mindfulness as “attacking” its object or &quot;plunging into it&quot;. He cites U Pandita who writes that satipaṭṭhāna practice means to “attack the object without hesitation ... with violence, speed or great force ... with excessive haste or hurry.” Analayo thinks this mistaken understanding of mindfulness &quot;arose because of a misreading or misinterpretation of a particular term&quot;. This is related to the interpretation of the Abhidhamma term &quot;apilāpeti&quot; (plunging) in the Theravada commentaries. Analayo agrees with Gethin, who argues instead for a reading of &quot;apilapati&quot; (or &quot;abhilapati&quot;) which means &quot;reminding&quot;.

Furthermore, even though the early discourses support the idea that one can attain stream entry without having developed the jhanas (mainly by listening to a discourse by the Buddha), Anālayo argues that &quot;for satipaṭṭhāna to unfold its full potential of leading to non-returning or full awakening arahantship], the development of absorption is required.&quot;

Sujato notes that not all modern Theravāda meditation traditions accept this dichotomy of samatha and vipassanā. According to Sujato, the teachers of the Thai forest tradition instead emphasize how samatha and vipassanā are complementary factors which must be practiced together. This is closer to how these two aspects of meditation are understood in the early Buddhist texts.

Similarly, Thanissaro Bhikkhu notes that: Although satipaṭṭhāna practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jhāna, a number of suttas—such as MN 125 and AN 8:63—equate the successful completion of this first stage [of satipaṭṭhāna practice] with the attainment of the first level of jhāna. This point is confirmed by the many suttas—MN 118 among them—describing how the practice of satipaṭṭhāna brings to completion the factors for awakening, which coincide with the factors of jhāna.According to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.

According to the theory of Theravada Buddhism, in the period of 5000 years after the parinirvana of Buddha, we can still attain Sotāpanna or even Arhat through practicing Satipatthana, and Satipatthana is the only way out. 

=== In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism ===
The four establishments of mindfulness also known as &quot;the four close placements of mindfulness&quot; (&quot;dran-pa nyer-bzhag&quot;) are also taught in Indo Tibetan Buddhism as they are part of the 37 factors leading to a purified state (&quot;byang-chub yan-lag so-bdun&quot;). They are discussed in Tibetan commentaries on Śāntideva&#x27;s &quot;Bodhicaryāvatāra,&quot; such as Pawo Tsugla Trengwa Rinpoche&#x27;s 16th century commentary and Kunzang Pelden&#x27;s (1862–1943) commentary &quot;The Nectar of Manjushri&#x27;s Speech&quot;.

The Tibetan canon also contains a &quot;True Dharma Application of Mindfulness Sutra&quot; (Tohoku Catalogue # 287, &quot;dam chos dran pa nyer bzhag&quot;, &quot;saddharmasmṛtyupasthānasutra&quot;). This sutra is cited by various Tibetan Buddhist figures, such as Atisha (in his &quot;Open Basket of Jewels&quot;) and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche (1759–1792). It is also cited as a sutra of the first turning by Khedrup Je (1385–1438 CE).

This sutra is a large text that dates from between the second and fourth centuries CE. It survives in Tibetan, Chinese and Sanskrit manuscripts. It is a complex and heterogeneous Mulasarvastivada text with various topics, such as long descriptions of the various realms in Buddhist cosmology, discussions of karma theory, meditation and ethics. The earliest layer of the text, which can be found in chapter two, contains the core meditation teachings of the text, which include an extensive exposition of six elements (&quot;dhatus&quot;) meditation, meditations on feeling (&quot;vedana&quot;), meditations on the &quot;skandhas&quot; and &quot;ayatanas&quot;, meditation on the mind and impermanence, and other meditation topics organized into a structure of ten levels (&quot;bhumi&quot;).

According to Jigme Lingpa&#x27;s (1730–1798) &quot;Treasury of Precious Qualities&quot;, the four applications of mindfulness are emphasized during the path of accumulation and in Mahayana are practiced with a focus on emptiness:&quot;If one practices according to the Hinayana, one meditates on the impurity of the body, on the feelings of sufferings, on the impermanence of consciousness and on the fact that mental objects are &quot;ownerless&quot; (there is no self to which they belong). If one practices according to the Mahayana, during the meditation session one meditates on the same things as being spacelike, beyond all conceptual constructs. In the post-meditation period one considers them as illusory and dreamlike.&quot;The general presentation of this practice in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition focuses on cultivating śamatha first, and then practicing vipaśyanā. Examples of contemporary figures in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism that have taught this practice include Chogyam Trungpa who often taught these practices in the USA and Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, a contemporary Tibetan lama. They have also been taught by the 14th Dalai Lama and students of his like Alexander Berzin and Thubten Chodron.

The four applications of mindfulness are also discussed by Nyingma scholars like as Rong-zom-pa (eleventh century), Longchenpa (1308–1364), and Ju Mipham (1846–1912). These authors describe specifically Vajrayana modes of the four smṛtyupasthānas, which have been adapted to the Vajrayana philosophy.

These four &quot;mantric&quot; smṛtyupasthānas described by Mipham are summarized by Dorji Wangchuk as follows: 

(1) Contemplating (&quot;blo bzhag pa&quot;) the physical bodies of oneself and others as being characterized by primordial or intrinsic purity (&quot;dag pa&quot;), on the one hand, and by emptiness (&quot;stong pa nyid&quot;), freedom from manifoldness (&quot;spros bral&quot;), great homogeneity (&quot;mnyam pa chen po&quot;), and integrality (&quot;zung du ’jug pa&quot;), on the other, is called &quot;kāyasmṛtyupasthāna&quot;.

(2) Transforming “conceptual constructions whose occurrence one feels/senses (or is aware of)” (&quot;byung tshor gyi rtog pa&quot;) into gnosis characterized by great bliss (&quot;bde ba chen po’i ye shes&quot;) is called &quot;vedanāsmṛtyupasthāna&quot;.

(3) Channelling or containing/constraining (&quot;sdom pa&quot;) all kinds of manifoldness associated with mind and mental factors into/in/to the innate sphere of the luminous nature of the mind is called &quot;cittasmṛtyupasthāna&quot;.

(4) Conducting oneself in a way (or with an attitude) that all saṃsāric and nirvāṇic, universal and particular phenomena are pure and equal and hence beyond adoption or rejection, is &quot;dharmasmṛtyupasthāna&quot;.

<text>A lower house is the lower chamber of a bicameral legislature, where the other chamber is the upper house. Although styled as &quot;below&quot; the upper house, in many legislatures worldwide, the lower house has come to wield more power or otherwise exert significant political influence.

== Common attributes ==
In comparison with the upper house, lower houses frequently display certain characteristics (though they vary by jurisdiction).

===Powers===
In a parliamentary system, the lower house:
* In the modern era, has much more power, usually due to restrictions on the upper house.
** Exceptions to this are Australia, Italy, and Romania, where the upper and lower houses have similar power.
* Is able to override the upper house in some ways.
* Can vote a motion of no confidence against the government, as well as vote for or against any proposed candidate for head of government at the beginning of the parliamentary term. 

In a presidential system, the lower house:
* Generally has less power than the upper house, but maintains exclusive powers in some areas.
* Has the sole power to impeach the executive; the upper house then tries the impeachment.
* Typically initiates legislation on appropriation and supply.

===Status===
The lower house:
* Can, in a parliamentary system, be dissolved by the executive.
* Has total or initial control over budget, supply, and monetary laws.
* Has a lower age of candidacy than the upper house.
* Is more numerous than the upper house.
** The Parliament of the United Kingdom furnishes a notable exception.

Members of the lower house:
* Are elected directly, while those of the upper house may hold their positions through direct or indirect election, appointment, or inheritance.
* Are elected more frequently, and all at once, not by staggered terms.
* Are usually numbered in proportion to the population of their administrative divisions, unlike in the upper house.

The government of the day is usually required to present its budget to the lower house, which must approve the budget. It is a widespread practice for revenue (appropriation) bills to originate in the lower house. A notable exception to this is the West Virginia House of Delegates in the United States, which allows revenue bills to originate from either house.

== Titles of lower houses ==
Many lower houses are named in manners such as follows:
* Chamber of Deputies
* Chamber of Representatives
* House of Assembly
* House of Commons
* House of Delegates
* House of the People (including Lok Sabha)
* House of Representatives
* Legislative Assembly
* National Assembly
* National Council
* Sejm/Seimas

<doc id="550190" wikidata="Q3173700" url="?curid=550190" title="Apportionment">
<text>The legal term apportionment (; Mediaeval Latin: , derived from , share), also called delimitation, is in general the distribution or allotment of proper shares, though may have different meanings in different contexts. Apportionment can refer to estate, the amount of compensation received by a worker and in respect of time.

This term may be employed roughly and sometimes has no technical meaning; this indicates the distribution of a benefit (&quot;e.g.&quot; salvage or damages under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, § 2), or liability (&quot;e.g.&quot; general average contributions, or tithe rent-charge), or the incidence of a duty (&quot;e.g.&quot; obligations as to the maintenance of highways).

==Apportionment in respect of estate==
Apportionment in respect of estate may result either from the act of the parties or from the operation of law.

===Apportionment by act of the parties===
Where a lessee is evicted from, or surrenders or forfeits possession of part of the property leased to him, he becomes liable at common law to pay only a rent apportioned to the value of the interest which he still retains. So where the person entitled to the reversion of an estate assigns part of it, the right to an apportioned part of the rent incident to the England, and in many of the British colonies. In the cases just mentioned there is apportionment in respect of estate by act of the parties.

=== Apportionment by operation of law ===
Apportionment by operation of law may be brought about where by act of law a lease becomes inoperative as regards its subject-matter, or by the &quot;act of God&quot;, as, for instance, where part of an estate is submerged by the encroachments of the sea. To the same category belongs the apportionment of rent which takes place under various statutes (&quot;e.g.&quot; the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 18), section 119, when land is required for public purposes; the Agricultural Holdings Act 1883 (46 &amp; 47 Vict. c. 61), section 41, in the case of a tenant from year to year receiving notice to quit part of a holding; and the Irish Land Act 1903 (3 Edw. 7. c. 37), section 61, apportionment of quit and crown rents).

== Apportionment in respect of time ==

At common law, there was no apportionment of rent in respect of time. Such apportionment was, however, in certain cases allowed in England by the Distress for Rent Act 1737, and the (4 &amp; 5 Will. 4. c. 22), and is now allowed generally. Under that statute (section 2) all rents, annuities, dividends and other periodical payments in the nature of income are to be considered as accruing from day to day and to be apportionable in respect of time accordingly. It is provided, however, that the apportioned part of such rents, etc., shall only be payable or recoverable in the case of a continuing payment, when the entire portion of which it forms part itself becomes payable, and, in the case of a payment determined by re-entry, death or otherwise, only when the next entire portion would have been payable if it had not so determined (§ 3). Persons entitled to apportioned parts of rent have the same remedies for recovering them when payable as they would have had in respect of the entire rent; but a lessee is not to be liable for any apportioned part specifically. The rent is recoverable by the heir or other person who would, but for the apportionment, be entitled to the entire rent, and he holds it subject to distribution (section 4). 
The (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 35) extends to payments not made under any instrument in writing (section 2), but not to annual sums made payable in policies of insurance (section 6). Apportionment under the act can be excluded by express stipulation.

The apportionment created by this statute is &quot;apportionment in respect of time.&quot; The cases to which it applies are mainly cases of either:
# apportionment of rent due under leases where at a time between the dates fixed for payment the lessor or lessee dies, or some other alteration in the position of parties occurs; or
# apportionment of income between the representatives of a limited owner and the remainder-man when the limited interest determines at a time between the date when such income became due.

=== Apportionment of rent ===
With regard to the former of these classes, it may be noticed that although apportioned rent becomes payable only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, in the case of the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order; and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company; and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent. Accordingly, where an assignment of a lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year&#x27;s rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an apportioned part of that half-year&#x27;s rent, computed from the last mentioned date. If someone pays a ground rent on a leasehold property or a rentcharge on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, they can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an &#x27;order of apportionment&#x27; that legally separates their share of the ground rent or rentcharge.

=== Apportionment of income ===
With regard to the apportionment of income, the only points requiring notice here are that all dividends payable by public companies are apportionable, whether paid at fixed periods or not, unless the payment is, in effect, a payment of capital (§ 5).

<text>USS &quot;Hewitt&quot; (DD-966), named for Admiral H. Kent Hewitt USN (1887–1972), was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi and launched on 14 September 1974 by Mrs. Leroy Hewitt Taylor and Mrs. Gerald Hewitt Norton, daughters of Admiral Hewitt.

==History==
&quot;Hewitt&quot; was the fourth of the &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers. Known as the &quot;Greyhounds of the fleet&quot; for their speed, versatility and reliability, they were the largest general purpose destroyers ever to fly the flag of the United States.
&quot;Hewitt&quot; was commissioned on 25 September 1976. After an intensive period of initial training, &quot;Hewitt&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific in September 1978 and was assigned to the U.S. 7th Fleet. In addition to serving as a front line unit, &quot;Hewitt&quot; also acted as a good will ambassador with port visits to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Hong Kong. &quot;Hewitt&quot; returned to San Diego in April 1979. In preparation for her next deployment, &quot;Hewitt&quot; participated in a multinational Rim-of-the-Pacific (RIMPAC) battle group exercise in February and March 1980.

She departed on her second overseas deployment on 15 May 1980. During that deployment, &quot;Hewitt&quot; and other members of Battle Group Charlie operated in the Indian Ocean to show U.S. resolve to protect free world access to Middle East petroleum resources, and to help obtain the release of 52 Americans held hostage in Iran. &quot;Hewitt&quot; earned the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her contributions. During the latter part of the deployment, &quot;Hewitt&quot; also earned the Humanitarian Service Medal for rescuing a group of Vietnamese boat refugees adrift in the South China Sea. For her superior performance, &quot;Hewitt&quot; was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; as the most outstanding ship in Destroyer Squadron 21 (DesRon 21) from 1979 to 1980.

&quot;Hewitt&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 19 May 1981 for its first regular overhaul. Extensive modifications were performed to improve survivability, and new combat systems capabilities were added to improve quick reaction to missile attacks. After a rigorous re-qualification and retraining period, &quot;Hewitt&quot; departed on 21 March 1983 for its third deployment. Highlights included a three aircraft carrier fleet exercise with , and , and independent operations in the South China Sea.

&quot;Hewitt&quot; departed on her fourth deployment on 18 October 1984. Once again a member of Battle Group Charlie, she spent seven highly successful months in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. In January 1985, &quot;Hewitt&quot; set a record at the Tabones Firing Range in the Philippines by earning the highest score ever recorded at the range for Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) exercise. From February to April 1985, &quot;Hewitt&quot; operated in the North Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman. For its achievements during the deployment, &quot;Hewitt&quot; received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. &quot;Hewitt&quot; returned home to San Diego on 24 May 1985.

On 1 September 1985, &quot;Hewitt&quot; and other members of Destroyer Squadron 31 became the first Pacific Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Squadron. The squadron&#x27;s basic mission was to locate and track submarines in the Eastern Pacific, to develop USW tactics and training, and to serve as a ready response force under Commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet. From September 1985 to April 1987, &quot;Hewitt&quot; and the other ships in DesRon 31 set new standards of excellence in USW.

During &quot;Hewitt&quot;&#x27;s second overhaul (May 1987 to November 1988) at National Steel and Shipbuilding Company Shipyard in San Diego, California, she underwent a modernization which included installation of the Vertical Launch System, the Tomahawk Missile System, the Close-In Weapons System (CIWS), LAMPS MK III, and the SQQ-89 Sonar System. After a brief but extensive training and inspection cycle, &quot;Hewitt&quot; joined DesRon 21 and once again deployed to the Persian Gulf on 18 September 1989. &quot;Hewitt&quot;&#x27;s fifth Western Pacific deployment ended on 16 March 1990. Five months later, &quot;Hewitt&quot; was underway to her new homeport at Yokosuka, Japan.

&quot;Hewitt&quot; joined Destroyer Squadron 15 on 25 August 1990. In Yokosuka, she operated with numerous multi-national forces, including the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the South Korean, Bruneian, Greek, French, Spanish, Australian, Saudi Arabian, Russian, British, and Singaporean navies. &quot;Hewitt&quot; participated as flagship for Maritime Interception Force (MIF) Commander Red Sea for Boarding Operations in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 as part of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. &quot;Hewitt&quot; concluded an intensive six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in April 1993. Her seventh deployment was highlighted by a Tomahawk strike against Iraq and combined operations with numerous navies, the Russian destroyer . &quot;Hewitt&quot; also served as Maritime Action Group (MAG) Commander in October 1993, helping to develop the new MAG warfare concept. &quot;Hewitt&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for the 1992–1993 Persian Gulf deployment and the U.S. 7th Fleet&#x27;s USW Excellence Award for 1993.

Following a brief maintenance availability in early 1994. &quot;Hewitt&quot; participated in RIMPAC &#x27;94. Directly following the exercise, &quot;Hewitt&quot; conducted live missile firings near Barking Sands, Kauai, Hawaii which included a successful NATO Sea Sparrow engagement and the first fleet firing of the Penguin anti-ship missile with HSL 51 Detachment 6 on 25 June 1994. &quot;Hewitt&quot; again deployed to the Persian Gulf on 5 September 1994 as a primary component of the multinational Middle East peacekeeping unit, enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq. &quot;Hewitt&quot; returned to Yokosuka, Japan 10 January 1995 and received U.S. 7th Fleet&#x27;s Surface Warfare Award for 1994.
On 17 March 1995, &quot;Hewitt&quot; entered the yards for an extended availability period which ended 5 September 1995. Afterwards, &quot;Hewitt&quot; participated in several multinational USW exercises and was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for her performance in 1995. On 3 June 1996, &quot;Hewitt&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf for Middle East Force deployment (MEF) 96-2. While supporting U.S. 5th Fleet operations, &quot;Hewitt&quot; participated in Operation Desert Strike and launched two Tomahawk missiles on 4 September 1996 against Iraq. &quot;Hewitt&quot; received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her actions during the deployment and returned home to Yokosuka, Japan on 30 October 1996.

In March 1997, &quot;Hewitt&quot; conducted battle group exercises with and in April Destroyer Squadron 15 for the Sharem 120B exercise in the Yellow Sea conducted with the Republic of Korea Navy. In May &quot;Hewitt&quot; entered an availability and received the women at-sea modification to berth the first females permanently assigned to the ship. The first female Sailors reported on board in July. On 24 August 1997, &quot;Hewitt&quot; departed Yokosuka, Japan for a homeport change to NS San Diego, California. &quot;Hewitt&quot; joined Destroyer Squadron 23 on 29 August 1997 during her transit to San Diego.

On 27 January 1999, &quot;Hewitt&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf for Middle East Force Deployment (MEF) 99-1. In support of U.N. Sanctions against Iraq. &quot;Hewitt&quot; conducted visit, board, search and seizure of merchants in the area. &quot;Hewitt&quot; returned to San Diego on 26 July 1999 followed by a two-month Selected Restricted Availability which ended 7 November 1999.

&quot;Hewitt&quot; was decommissioned 19 July 2001; she was sold for scrap to International Shipbreaking, Incorporated, of Brownsville, Texas on 9 August 2001. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 5 June 2002.

<text>Red mercury is a discredited substance, most likely a hoax perpetrated by con artists who sought to take advantage of gullible buyers on the black market for arms. These con artists described it as a substance used in the creation of nuclear weapons; because of the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons development, it is difficult to disprove their claims completely. However, all samples of alleged &quot;red mercury&quot; analyzed in the public literature have proven to be well-known, common substances of no interest to weapons makers.

== History ==
References to red mercury first appeared in major Soviet and western media sources in the late 1980s. The articles were never specific as to what exactly red mercury was, but nevertheless claimed it was of great importance in nuclear bombs, or that it was used in the building of boosted fission weapons. Almost as soon as the stories appeared, people started attempting to buy it. At that point, the purported nature of the substance started to change, and eventually turned into anything the buyer happened to be interested in. As &quot;New Scientist&quot; reported in 1992, a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report outlined that:

When red mercury first appeared on the international black market 15 years ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was &#x27;red&#x27; because it came from Russia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist states of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are red mercury&#x27;s stock in trade.

The report, compiled by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber? What you need is red mercury.

A 1993 article in the Russian newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;, claiming to be informed by leaked top-secret memos, described red mercury as:

[A] super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, &#x27;Stealth&#x27; surfaces and self-guided warheads. Primary end-users are major aerospace and nuclear-industry companies in the United States and France along with nations aspiring to join the nuclear club, such as South Africa, Israel, Iran, Iraq, and Libya.

Two TV documentaries about red mercury were made by British Channel 4 television, airing in 1993 and 1994; &quot;Trail of Red Mercury&quot; and &quot;Pocket Neutron&quot;, which claimed to have &quot;startling evidence that Russian scientists have designed a miniature neutron bomb using a mysterious compound called red mercury&quot;.

Samuel T. Cohen, an American physicist who worked on building the atomic bomb, said in his autobiography that red mercury is manufactured by &quot;mixing special nuclear materials in very small amounts into the ordinary compound and then inserting the mixture into a nuclear reactor or bombarding it with a particle-accelerator beam.&quot; When detonated, this mixture allegedly becomes &quot;extremely hot, which allows pressures and temperatures to be built up that are capable of igniting the heavy hydrogen and producing a pure-fusion mini neutron bomb.&quot;

Red mercury was offered for sale throughout Europe and the Middle East by Russian businessmen, who found many buyers who would pay almost anything for the substance, even though they had no idea what it was. A study for the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; published in 1997 has perhaps the most factual summary of red mercury:

The asking price for red mercury ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 per kilogram. Sometimes the material would be irradiated or shipped in containers with radioactive symbols, perhaps to convince potential buyers of its strategic value. But samples seized by police contained only mercury(II) oxide, mercury(II) iodide, or mercury mixed with red dye – hardly materials of interest to weapons-makers.

Following the arrest of several men in Britain in September 2004, on suspicion that they were trying to buy a kilogram of red mercury for £900,000, the International Atomic Energy Agency made a statement dismissing claims that the substance is real. &quot;Red mercury doesn&#x27;t exist,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;The whole thing is a bunch of .&quot; When the case came to trial at the Old Bailey in April 2006, it became apparent that &quot;News of the World&quot;″s &quot;fake sheikh&quot; Mazher Mahmood had worked with the police to catch the three men (Dominic Martins, Roque Fernandes and Abdurahman Kanyare). They were tried for &quot;trying to set up funding or property for terrorism&quot; and &quot;having an article (a highly dangerous mercury-based substance) for terrorism&quot;. According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, and whether or not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution. All three men were acquitted in July 2006.

== Analysis ==
Several common mercury compounds are indeed red, such as mercury sulfide (from which the bright-red pigment vermilion was originally derived), mercury(II) oxide (historically called ), and mercury(II) iodide, and others are explosive, such as mercury(II) fulminate. No use for any of these compounds in nuclear weapons has been publicly documented. &quot;Red mercury&quot; could also be a code name for a substance that contains no mercury at all.

A variety of different items have been chemically analyzed as putative samples of &quot;red mercury&quot; since the substance first came to the attention of the media, but no single substance was found in these items. A sample of radioactive material was seized by German police in May 1994. This consisted of a complex mixture of elements, including about 10% by weight plutonium, with the remainder consisting of 61% mercury, 11% antimony, 6% oxygen, 2% iodine and 1.6% gallium. The reason why somebody had assembled this complex mixture of chemicals is unknown; equally puzzling was the presence of fragments of glass and brush bristles, suggesting that someone had dropped a bottle of this substance and then swept it up into a new container.

In contrast, an analysis reported in 1998 of a different &quot;red mercury&quot; sample concluded that this sample was a non-radioactive mixture of elemental mercury, water and mercury(II) iodide, which is a red colored chemical. Similarly, another analysis of a sample recovered in Zagreb in November 2003 reported that this item contained only mercury. One formula that had been claimed previously for red mercury was Hg2Sb2O7 (mercury(II) pyroantimonate), but no antimony was detected in this 2003 sample.

== Explanations ==
Red mercury was described by many commentators, and the exact nature of its supposed working mechanism varied widely among them. In general, however, none of these explanations appear to be scientifically or historically supportable.

=== Background ===
Traditional staged thermonuclear weapons consist of two parts, a fission &quot;primary&quot; and a fusion/fission &quot;secondary&quot;. The energy released by the primary when it explodes is used to (indirectly) compress the secondary and start a fusion reaction within it. Conventional explosives are far too weak to provide the level of compression needed.

The primary is generally built as small as possible, because the energy released by the secondary is much larger, and thus building a larger primary is generally inefficient. There is a lower limit on the size of the primary, known as the critical mass. For weapons grade plutonium, this is around . This can be reduced through the use of neutron reflectors or clever arrangements of explosives to compress the core, but these methods generally add to the size and complexity of the resulting device.

Because of the need for a fission primary and the difficulty of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority of arms control efforts to limit nuclear proliferation rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.

=== Shortcut to fissionable material ===
A theory popular in the mid-1990s was that red mercury facilitated the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with Zippe-type centrifuges, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease the construction of a clandestine nuclear weapon.

=== Shortcut to fusible material ===
A key part of the secondary in a fusion bomb is lithium-6-deuteride. When irradiated with high-energy neutrons, Li-6 creates tritium, which mixes with the deuterium in the same mixture and fuses at a relatively low temperature. Russian weapon designers have reported (1993) that red mercury was the Soviet codename for lithium-6, which has an affinity for mercury and tends to acquire a red colour due to mercuric impurities during its separation process.

===Red mercury as a ballotechnic===
Samuel T. Cohen, the &quot;father of the neutron bomb&quot;, claimed for a long time that red mercury is a powerful explosive-like chemical known as a ballotechnic. The energy released during its reaction is allegedly enough to directly compress the secondary without the need for a fission primary in a thermonuclear weapon. He claimed that he learned that the Soviet scientists perfected the use of red mercury and used it to produce a number of softball-sized pure fusion bombs weighing as little as , which he claimed were made in large numbers.

He went on to claim that the reason this is not more widely known is that elements within the US power structure are deliberately suppressing or hiding information due to the frightening implications such a weapon would have on nuclear proliferation. Since a red mercury bomb would require no fissile material, it would seemingly be impossible to protect against its widespread proliferation given current arms control methodologies. Instead of trying to do so, they simply claim it does not exist, while acknowledging its existence privately. Cohen also claimed that when President Boris Yeltsin took power, he secretly authorized the sale of red mercury on the international market, and that fake versions of it were sometimes offered to gullible buyers.

Critics argue Cohen&#x27;s claims are difficult to support scientifically. The amount of energy released by the fission primary is thousands of times greater than that released by conventional explosives, and it appears that the &quot;red mercury&quot; approach would be orders of magnitude smaller than required.

Additionally, it appears there is no independent confirmation of any sort of Cohen&#x27;s claims to the reality of red mercury. The scientists in charge of the labs where the material would have been made have publicly dismissed the claims (see below), as have numerous US colleagues, including Edward Teller.

According to Cohen, veteran nuclear weapon designer Frank Barnaby conducted secret interviews with Russian scientists who told him that red mercury was produced by dissolving mercury antimony oxide in mercury, heating and irradiating the resultant amalgam, and then removing the elemental mercury through evaporation. The irradiation was reportedly carried out by placing the substance inside a nuclear reactor.

=== Stealth paint ===
As mentioned earlier, one of the origins of the term &quot;red mercury&quot; was in the Russian newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;, which claimed that red mercury was &quot;a super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, &#x27;stealth&#x27; surfaces and self-guided warheads.&quot; Any substance with these sorts of highly differing properties would be suspect to most, but the stealth story continued to have some traction long after most had dismissed the entire story.

=== Nuclear &quot;sting&quot; operations ===
Red mercury is thought by some to be the invention of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and rogue states who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market. One televised report indicated that the Soviet Union encouraged the KGB and GRU to arrange sting operations for the detection of those seeking to deal in nuclear materials. The Soviet intelligence services allegedly created a myth of the necessity of &quot;red mercury&quot; for the sorts of nuclear devices that terrorists and rogue governments might seek. Political entities that already had nuclear weapons did nothing to debunk the myth.

In 1999 &quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review&quot; suggested that victims of red mercury scams may have included Osama bin Laden.

=== Red mercury in southern Africa ===
Organizations involved in landmine clearance and unexploded munitions disposal noted a belief amongst some communities in southern Africa that red mercury may be found in certain types of ordnance. Attempting to extract red mercury, purported to be highly valuable, was reported as a motivation for people dismantling items of unexploded ordnance, and suffering death or injury as a result. In some cases it was reported that unscrupulous traders may be deliberately promoting this misconception in an effort to build a market for recovered ordnance.

An explosion in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe, that killed five people is attributed to a quest to reclaim red mercury from a live landmine.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In April 2009 it was reported from Saudi Arabia that rumors that Singer sewing machines contained &quot;red mercury&quot; had caused the prices of such machines to massively increase in the Kingdom, with some paying up to SR200,000 for a single machine which could previously have been bought for SR200. Believers in the rumor claimed that the presence of red mercury in the sewing machines&#x27; needles could be detected using a mobile telephone; if the line cut off when the telephone was placed near to the needle, this supposedly proved that the substance was present.

In Medina there was a busy trade in the sewing machines, with buyers seen using mobile phones to check the machines for red mercury content, while it was reported that others had resorted to theft, with two tailors&#x27; shops in Dhulum broken into and their sewing machines stolen. At other locales, there were rumors that a Kuwait-based multinational had been buying up the Singer machines, while in Al-Jouf, the residents were led to believe that a local museum was buying up any such machines that it could find, and numerous women appeared at the museum offering to sell their Singer machines.

There was little agreement among believers in the story as to the exact nature or even color of the red mercury, while the supposed uses for it ranged from it being an essential component of nuclear power, to having the ability to summon jinn, extract gold, or locate buried treasure and perform other forms of magic. These beliefs in the supernatural properties of red mercury are rooted in medieval Islamic conceptions of the alchemical properties of mercury. The official spokesman for the Riyadh police said that the rumors had been started by gangs attempting to swindle people out of their money, and denied the existence of red mercury in sewing machines.

She was assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet as a unit of Destroyer Squadron 9 (DesRon 9), under the administrative control of Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group Five and Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific. After arrival, &quot;Elliot&quot; conducted five weeks of shakedown training and participated in a combat exercise. Following these evolutions, she returned to her builders for a post shakedown yard availability.

After leaving the yard, &quot;Elliot&quot; sailed to Rockland, Maine arriving on 25 August. Neighboring Thomaston was the hometown of the sailor for whom the ship was named. During a four-day stay, the ship hosted several thousand guests and embarked 650 guests for a six-hour guest cruise.

<text>Leaside (/&#x27;liːˌsaɪd/) is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located northeast of Downtown Toronto, in the vicinity of Eglinton Avenue East and Bayview Avenue. It is one of the most expensive and exclusive neighbourhoods in the city. The area takes its name from William Lea and the Lea family, who settled there in the early years of the 19th century. The area first developed as farmland along with Toronto through the 19th century. It was incorporated as a town in 1913. In 1967, it amalgamated with the township of East York to form the borough of East York. In 1998, it became part of the city of Toronto.

==History==
===Early history===
The general area of Toronto had been inhabited by various First Nations at least as early as 3000 BCE, when the Laurentian peoples moved south into the area just east of Toronto. The first European known to travel to the area was Étienne Brûlé, who passed through the area in the early part of the 17th century. Surveying by Europeans began in earnest in the 1780s, with people fleeing the American Revolution.

John Lea Sr. was born in 1773 in Lancashire and immigrated to York, Upper Canada in 1819, coming from Philadelphia in the United States where they immigrated to in 1818. Before immigrating, he married Mary Hutchison (born in Cumberland) and they had their first child in Lanchester on May 28, 1814 and named him William Lea. He purchased Lot 13 in the third concession from Alexander McDonnell on January 23, 1820 and settled there with his family. John Lea Sr. had three children - William, John Jr. and Mary. In 1851, William Lea bought land just south of his father&#x27;s farm, and began constructing a large, octagonal brick house, which he named &quot;Leaside&quot;. The house was completed in 1854, the same year John Lea Sr. died, aged 81. The building served not only as a home and court house for William Lea&#x27;s family, but after he became a Magistrate in the County of York, soon served as a residence, a town hall and a post office as well. The property became the possession of William&#x27;s eldest son Joseph upon his death in 1893. Joseph lived in the octagonal house until 1903. Afterwards, it was abandoned and later demolished by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1913. The company later set fire to the old landmark in order to clear the land to make way for the company&#x27;s proposed sidings and townsite.

In the 1870s, the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company purchased a few acres (hectares) of land on the south-east corner of William Lea&#x27;s property to run its railway across. The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company encountered financial difficulties in 1884, and leased part of its railway, including the section of track running through Leaside, to the Canadian Pacific Railway for 999 years. The Canadian Pacific Railway decided to establish a maintenance stop and a sliding by-pass on the railway on the land purchased from William Lea, which was considered attractive because it was uniformly flat. The station was completed in September 1894 and named &quot;Leaside&quot; in honour of William Lea. In 1892, a junction was built in the Leaside area, and a railway line named the Don Branch was constructed south along the Don River towards the original Union Station on Toronto&#x27;s waterfront.

===Development of a model town===

In 1912, William Mackenzie and Donald Mann, the owners of the Canadian Northern Railway, hired landscape architect Frederick Todd to plan development for a community to be built around a maintenance yard for their railway, which ran beside the CP lines through the Leaside area. Mackenzie and Todd founded the York Land Company to purchase land for such a town. The company purchased over , including most of the third concession and some land north of Eglinton Avenue. The purchased lands extended from the railway tracks in the south to three farms north of Eglinton Avenue, from Leslie Street in the east to Bayview Avenue in the west. The town of Leaside was planned by Todd for the company, which put its name to many of the local streets; Laird Drive, Hanna Road, and Wicksteed Avenue all bear the name of Canadian Northern Railway company executives. The new community was planned with commercial areas, residential areas, and a town centre west of Laird Drive, and space was laid out east of Laird Drive for industrial development. The goal of the company was to create Leaside as a new upper class residential area of Toronto, the &quot;New Rosedale&quot;. The developers first approached the town of North Toronto, hoping that North Toronto would annex the area and provide services such as streets, sewers, and public transportation. The town council of North Toronto refused. A similar request to the city of Toronto was met with a similar reply. With their attempts to include Leaside within another city or town rebuffed, Colonel Davidson and Randolph McRae applied to the province of Ontario to incorporate Leaside as a town.

The Town of Leaside was officially incorporated on April 23, 1913. The population of Leaside was 43. The Canadian Northern Railway company approved Todd&#x27;s town plan on May 8, 1913. A town council for Leaside was elected on May 8, 1913 and they approved the plan for the town on May 21, 1913, which was the final legal approval needed before the plan could be implemented. On June 21, 1913, the &quot;Toronto World&quot; carried the announcement that properties in Leaside&#x27;s planned community would be marked in the fall of that year. In September 1913, lots went on sale within the planned community.

In 1914, the industrial area that had been set aside east of Laird Drive received its first tenant. Canada Wire and Cable began construction of a factory for production of 9.2 inch shells for World War I. In addition to the new factory, Canada Wire and Cable moved their other Toronto production plants to the same location to increase efficiency. Canada Wire and Cable also created the subsidiary company Leaside Munitions Company to oversee shell production. Soon after, construction began on a federal government owned airstrip, named Leaside Aerodrome. The York Land Company leased about to the government for the airfield, between Wicksteed Avenue and Eglinton Avenue. On May 21, 1917 construction began on the airfield. At the close of the war, there were accommodations for around 1000 military personnel.

While the industrial development in the area went ahead as planned during World War One, the anticipated residential development did not occur. As late as 1929 the population remained under 500. World War I spurred the demand for industrial output but diminished the call for new housing. The bankruptcy of Canadian Northern Railway left the project at a loss and Leaside&#x27;s isolated location made it unappealing to workers from Toronto.

===Growth as a suburb of Toronto===
After the war, the strip became the site of Canada&#x27;s first delivery of airmail on June 18, 1918, when pilot Brian Peck delivered 120 letters from Montreal, Quebec. This delivery was initially organised at the behest of some of his friends in Montreal who wanted letters delivered to Toronto; however, when Canada Post heard of the plans, they gathered together the letters as a test of an airmail system. After the war, with little need for shells and other war materials, the factories of the Leaside Munition Company were closed. These buildings were quickly occupied by the Durant Motor Company, which produced cars named Durants and Stars as well as the Rugby truck.

Leaside&#x27;s growth slowed after World War I, with its primary industry being war industry. The existing houses had all been built for employees of the Leaside Munitions Company by the company. However, at this time Leaside stood on the edge of Toronto and was increasingly an appealing place for investment. Investors from Baltimore bought property that had previously belonged to Robert T. Davies for the construction of a race track. They formed the Thorncliffe Park Racing and Breeding Association Ltd. to operate the track.

The Leaside Viaduct was completed on October 29, 1927, providing easy connection between east Toronto and Leaside. This led to the rapid growth of Leaside at the time, and in the future. The impassibility of the Don River valley had previously made it difficult for people employed in Toronto to reside in Leaside. The same month, an underpass on Millwood Road was opened through the valley.

In 1928, the Lincoln Electric Company of Canada Ltd. relocated from Toronto&#x27;s west end to Leaside. The company originally sold Lincoln motors in Canada, but incorporated in 1930 and began the manufacture of motors in Leaside. At the onset of the Great Depression, the Durant Motor Company ran into financial troubles. The last cars were produced in 1933, and the buildings were occupied by the Canada Wire and Cable company.

At the start of World War II, Lincoln Electric moved their operations to Leaside industrial park, adjacent to the Canada Wire and Cable plant. The new location, constructed in 1940, covered . On July 16, 1940, Research Enterprises Limited was incorporated. The company operated only during the war, closing in 1946. It was, however, the largest single employer in Leaside&#x27;s history, employing over 7500 men and women at its peak. The site manufactured military radio equipment and optical supplies, with a total value of $220 million (CDN) in goods produced during the war.

As part of a Royal Canadian Air Force public relations plan, the town of Leaside officially &quot;adopted&quot; No. 432 Squadron RCAF of No. 6 Group RCAF. Formed and adopted on 1 May 1943, the squadron took the town&#x27;s name as its nickname, becoming 432 &quot;Leaside&quot; squadron RCAF. The sponsorship lasted the duration of the war.

In 1945, at the end of World War II, the population of Leaside stood at 9,800. In 1949, Leaside&#x27;s population had grown to 14,826.

On May 14, 1952, the Sunnybrook Plaza, located on the north-east corner of Bayview Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East, became one of the first shopping centres in Toronto. The site was previously a marsh where people dug loam for their gardens.

In 1952 the Lincoln Electric company expanded to a plant, and their site expanded to cover almost . They leased an additional building in Leaside to house their distribution center.

The last horse race at Thorncliffe Park was run on June 23, 1952. Investors from Toronto bought the racetrack that year.

The rapid growth of Thorncliffe in the 1950s necessitated the construction of a second north–south bridge across the Don Valley. In 1955, Leaside&#x27;s population had grown to 16,779 and the Leaside town council approved the second bridge. Construction of the bridge was completed on September 7, 1960 and it was opened by Leslie Frost. The bridge was named the Charles Hiscott Bridge in honour of Leaside&#x27;s mayor at the time.

===Amalgamation and recent history===
In 1967, Leaside amalgamated with the township of East York to form the borough of East York. As such Leaside became a neighbourhood within East York.

Passenger train service to Leaside Station ended in 1970, and the station was closed. The station would reopen briefly in the 1980s as a restaurant, but would see no further passenger traffic. Leaside Airport fell into disuse, and in 1971 the last hangar was demolished.

Canada Wire and Cable was purchased by Alcatel in 1991, and the operations relocated to Markham in 1996, with the location being converted to a shopping centre. The plant had expanded through the years and been a major influence in Leaside, employing over 2700 workers at its peak. It had also been a strong influence over the community in other ways, investing in the community in various ways, including the construction of a water main in 1918.

East York merged with five other municipalities in 1998 to form the new City of Toronto.

Line 5 Eglinton, also known as the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, will have 3 stations in Leaside when opened in 2025 (est.): underground stations at Bayview Avenue and at Laird Drive, and a grade level station at Leslie Street.

== Geography ==

Leaside lies on the Iroquois Plain. The actions of the glacial Lake Iroquois made the Leaside area into a flat plateau, surrounded on three sides by deep river valleys.

== Culture ==

Leaside is made up predominantly of single-family homes housing upper-middle-class families. The most famous house in Leaside is James Lea&#x27;s, located at 201 Sutherland Drive. Built in 1909, it is unique in that the back of the house faces Sutherland Drive. It was originally built to face a street that no longer exists.

===Recreation===
The largest recreation centre in Leaside is Leaside Memorial Community Gardens which includes an indoor swimming pool, two ice rinks, a curling rink, and a large auditorium.

Serena Gundy Park is in the north-east corner of Leaside. The parkland was donated to Leaside in 1960 by the estate of James H. Gundy. The park covers which are generally in a natural state. The park is used for picnicking and hiking in the summer and cross country skiing in the winter. The park is also connected by walking paths to Sunnybrook Park.

Trace Manes Park is in south Leaside. The park is home to the Leaside Tennis club and sports six tennis courts. Other facilities in the park include a playground, a baseball diamond, and an outdoor ice rink in winter.

Howard Talbot Park in south-west Leaside features two baseball diamonds. Additionally it features a &quot;splash pad&quot;, a water playground for young children.

==Education==
Northlea Elementary and Middle School is located on the site of the old Divadale Estate on Rumsey Road north of Eglinton Avenue. It was opened in 1944 and had 15 classrooms. In 1991–93, the school underwent extensive renovations and the school now educates over 800 students. The renovation provided additional classroom space to the school as well as a new library, and second gymnasium. The playing field is artificial turf. The school is operated by the Toronto District School Board. Northlea is a dual track school offering regular English programs from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8, and French Immersion programs from Senior Kindergarten to Grade 8. Northlea welcomes commuters for the impressive French Immersion programs.

Bessborough Elementary and Middle School, located close to Leaside High School in South Leaside, has offered education to those living in the older part of Leaside. St. Anselm Catholic School, also located on Bessborough Drive, opened in 1939 and presently has an enrollment of 340 students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8. 

Rolph Road Elementary School, an elementary school for junior kindergarten to grade 6, is the other elementary school in the neighbourhood. Located on Rolph Road, it is in South Leaside and is a feeder school to Bessborough.

Leaside High School began on the top floor of Rolph Road School in 1945. The &quot;new&quot; high school opened in September 1948 and welcomed back local students who had been attending Lawrence Park and Jarvis Collegiate.

Along with the growth of these schools in the 1940s and 1950s, the growing population of Leaside also supported one of North Toronto&#x27;s first preschools. Sunnybrook School was founded in 1952 in the basement of St. Augustine of Canterbury Church in Leaside. In 1960 the school moved to its present 469 Merton Street location, just west of Leaside in Davisville.

In addition to the Toronto District School Board, three other public school boards also operate in the city. The Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), is a public English separate school board; Conseil scolaire Viamonde is a secular French public school board; and the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud is a French separate public school board. However, the French school boards do not operate a school in the Leaside neighbourhood.

St. Anselm Catholic School is a coeducational, Catholic, elementary school in the south of Toronto, Ontario. It was named after the philosopher and theologian of Canterbury, Saint Anselm. It was established in 1939, with only 2 classrooms under principal Mary Breen. Additions to the school were made in 1943, 1947 and 1951. The library and gymnasium were added in 1966. Today the school serves students from Kindergarten to 8th grade. In 1997, the MSSB/TCDSB made funds for the school to be a two-story building. When the school was being renovated, the students were moved to 1107 Avenue Road, which is now Marshall McLuhan. The students came back to the newly renovated school in 1998.

Bloorview School Authority is an educational facility physically located within the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital in north Leaside, although they are each separate legal entities. The Bloorview School Authority offers various educational programs for children, some of whom are patients in the hospital. Included in the offerings is a full day program for children from junior kindergarten to grade one, based on Ontario school curriculum.

== Politics ==
The first town council for Leaside was elected on May 8, 1913. The council had five members: Randolph McRae, who served as the mayor, and Harvey Fitzsimmons, Laurence Boulton, George Saunders and Archibald McRae who served as aldermen. All were acclaimed in the election, all were employees of the Canadian Northern Railway.

From 1913 to 1966, Leaside had its own mayor. The last four occupants were - Howard T. Burrell (1951–1955); Charles H. Hiscott (1956–1961); Lloyd M. Dickinson (1962); Beth Nealson (1963–1966).

In 1967, Leaside was amalgamated with the township of East York to form the borough of East York, from this point forward Leaside was a community within East York, and governed by the municipal council of East York. Amalgamation was opposed by Leaside residents fearing residential tax increases and the loss of the Leaside community identity. Taxes in Leaside were lower than the surrounding regions as residential taxes in Leaside were subsidized by those from industrial areas; residential taxes climbed in Leaside every year from 1967 to 1972. Beth Nealson, the last mayor of Leaside ran against True Davidson (the reeve of East York) for mayor of the amalgamated borough. Nealson lost to Davidson.

In 1998, East York (including Leaside) was amalgamated with the City of Toronto to form the City of Toronto, from this point forward Leaside was a community within Toronto, and governed by the municipal council of Toronto.

In 2006, incumbent Don Valley West councillor Jane Pitfield, whose ward included Leaside, ran for mayor. Former Progressive Conservative MPP John Parker won her former seat in that year&#x27;s election. In the 2010 Toronto municipal election that saw Rob Ford elected to the office of Mayor of Toronto, Parker won another tight race for councillor of Ward 26, beating runner up Jon Burnside by only 415 votes. After a tumultuous term of increased traffic in the neighbourhood and rapid development along the Laird Drive corridor and in Thorncliffe Park, Parker lost the seat to Burnside by a margin of 3,248 votes.

<text>James Michael Flaherty (December 30, 1949 – April 10, 2014) was a Canadian politician who served as the federal minister of finance from 2006 to 2014 under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

First elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1995 under the Progressive Conservative (PC) banner, Flaherty would sit as a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) until 2006, also serving in a number of Cabinet positions from 1997 to 2002 during Premier Mike Harris&#x27; government. He unsuccessfully ran for the PC leadership twice.

Flaherty entered federal politics and ran for the Conservative Party in the 2006 election. With his party forming government, Prime Minister Harper named Flaherty as finance minister. As finance minister, Flaherty reduced personal income taxes and corporate taxes, reduced the goods and services tax to 5%, introduced the tax-free savings account, and dealt with the Great Recession; the $55.6 billion deficit in the 2009 Canadian federal budget was eliminated in 2014 as a result of major spending cuts. Flaherty tabled nine federal budgets and was the longest continuously serving minister in Harper&#x27;s government until his resignation in 2014.

Flaherty died of a heart attack three weeks after his resignation as minister. His widow, Christine Elliott, later served as the deputy premier of Ontario.

== Early life, education and career (1949–1995) ==
Flaherty was born on December 30, 1949 in Lachine, Quebec, the son of Mary (née Harquail), who was from a &quot;prosperous family&quot;, and Edwin Benedict Flaherty, an entrepreneur and chemist. His parents were from New Brunswick, his father from Loggieville and his mother from Campbellton. He was the sixth of eight children. He attended Bishop Whelan High School and Loyola High School, Montreal. Flaherty attended Princeton University, where he graduated cum laude with an A.B. in sociology in 1970. He wrote his senior thesis, titled &quot;Camp X: Sensitivity Training with a Group of Young Adults&quot;, on the sensitivity training at Camp X, a military training institute in Ontario. He then received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University.

He practised law for 20 years, and was a founding partner of Flaherty Dow Elliott after splitting from Gilbert Wright and Flaherty. Flaherty Dow Elliott &amp; McCarthy LLP, as it is now known, is a law firm specializing in motor vehicle accident and personal injury litigation.

Flaherty ran for in the provincial election of 1990, finishing third against New Democrat Drummond White and Liberal Allan Furlong in the riding of Durham Centre. He ran again and was elected in the 1995 election.

== Provincial political career (1995–2005) ==

=== Cabinet ===
He was named Minister of Labour in the cabinet of Premier Mike Harris on October 10, 1997, and kept this position until after the 1999 election. He also served as interim Solicitor General and Minister of Correctional Services from April 27 to July 27, 1998.

Flaherty was re-elected in the 1999 election in the redistributed riding of Whitby–Ajax, and was named Attorney General with responsibility for Native Affairs on June 17, 1999. On February 8, 2001, he was appointed Minister of Finance and Deputy Premier. He was a key promoter of tax credits for parents sending their children to private and denominational schools, which the Tories had campaigned against in 1999. In June 2001, Flaherty was evicted from his constituency office in a theatrical action by Ontario Coalition Against Poverty which aimed to bring home the effects of his policies.

=== 2002 Ontario PC leadership bid ===
Flaherty ran to succeed Harris in the 2002 PC leadership election, but lost to frontrunner Ernie Eves, his predecessor as finance minister. Flaherty&#x27;s campaign featured attacks on Eves, calling him a &quot;serial waffler&quot; and a &quot;pale, pink imitation of Dalton McGuinty&quot;.

Flaherty&#x27;s leadership campaign focused on &quot;law and order&quot; themes, and one of his proposals was to make homelessness illegal. His purported plan was to have special constables encourage homeless persons to seek out shelters or hospitals. He argued that his policy would save the lives of homeless persons; leadership rival Elizabeth Witmer and other critics described it as callous, and ineffective against the root causes of homelessness.

Flaherty also promised to implement further tax cuts, carry through with plans to create a tax credit for parents sending their children to private school, and privatizing the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Flaherty also emerged as a social conservative in this campaign, particularly a staunch stance against abortion and his association with anti-abortion groups. On April 15, 2002, Eves demoted him to the less-prominent position of Minister of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation. Flaherty retained this position until the Tories were defeated in the provincial election of 2003. Flaherty himself was re-elected by a reduced margin.

=== Opposition and 2004 Ontario PC leadership bid ===
Following the defeat of the Conservatives, Eves announced that he would resign as leader in 2004. Flaherty declared himself a candidate to succeed him, but was defeated by John Tory by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent on the second ballot of the PC leadership election held on September 18, 2004. His supporters included former cabinet ministers John Baird, Tim Hudak and Norm Sterling. His 2004 leadership campaign was similar to that of 2002. He emphasized fiscally conservative themes, including further tax cuts and greater privatization. He promised to create EXCEL scholarships, whereby students attaining high grades in high school would have half their university tuition paid by the government. Until 2005, Flaherty served as finance critic in John Tory&#x27;s shadow cabinet.

== Finance minister (2006–2014) ==

On June 13, 2005, the Canadian news website bourque.org reported that a meeting of prominent Conservative organizers and fundraisers had been held to plan for a Flaherty bid for the leadership of the federal party should Stephen Harper resign. In December 2005, the 2006 general election was called. Flaherty resigned his seat in the Ontario legislature to run for the Conservative Party of Canada in the riding of Whitby—Oshawa, narrowly unseating incumbent Judi Longfield.

Flaherty&#x27;s wife, Christine Elliott, won Flaherty&#x27;s former provincial seat in a by-election, defeating Longfield who was running as the provincial Liberal candidate. This marked the first time in Canadian history that a husband and wife have simultaneously represented the same electoral district at two different levels of government.

On February 6, 2006, Flaherty was sworn in as Minister of Finance in Stephen Harper&#x27;s new Conservative Cabinet. He was also appointed Minister Responsible for the Greater Toronto Area. In his capacity as Minister of Finance, he served as a Governor of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

He announced his resignation from the cabinet on March 18, 2014.

=== October 31, 2006, income trust announcement ===
Flaherty was a central figure in the debate surrounding the new proposed rules for taxation of Canadian income trusts. His announcement on October 31, 2006 of a rule change to tax income trusts levelled the playing field between forms of business such that businesses operating as income trusts no longer enjoyed a tax advantage over businesses operating as corporations. The announcement was accompanied by a further planned reduction in the corporate rate so that the two moves together were not expected to generate additional revenue for the government.

Flaherty said that income trusts would cost the government $500 million annually in lost tax revenue and shift the burden onto ordinary people. The Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors said that foreign takeovers of Canadian income trusts have had the opposite effect and caused decrease in federal government tax revenues.

Diane Francis, editor-at-large for the &quot;National Post&quot;, urged that the rule changes be recanted, arguing that there were flaws in the policy which hurt Canadian investors.

Special hearings by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance commenced January 30, 2007. John McCallum, the Liberal finance critic, asked Flaherty to explain the reasoning behind the change in income trust tax policy. McCallum said &quot;Your first problem is that having lured hundreds of thousands of ordinary Canadians into income trusts by promising not to raise taxes you then cut them off at the knees.&quot;

On February 28, 2007, the committee released their report, &quot;Taxing Income Trusts: Reconcilable or Irreconcilable differences?&quot;, recommending a reduction of the proposed tax to 10 percent from 31.5 percent.

==== Fullard opposition ====
On August 21, 2008, Brent Fullard, president of the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors, challenged Flaherty to debate supposed tax leakage associated with income trusts. Fullard announced he would put up $50,000, payable to his favourite charity. Given the minister&#x27;s &quot;current crusade on financial literacy&quot;, Fullard believed a suitable charitable cause would be a scholarship for business education. &quot;By doing this we could help repair the damage caused by the Minister&#x27;s statement that Ontario is the last place to invest.&quot; Flaherty turned down the request. &quot;The tax fairness plan is law. The Minister made his position clear before the finance committee and there is no need for further debate,&quot; according to his press spokesperson.

=== Registered Disability Savings Plan ===
In Budget 2007, Flaherty introduced the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP). The RDSP is a long-term savings plan to help Canadians with disabilities and their families save. The RDSP resembles its other saving counterparts, the RRSP and the RESP, and is meant to ensure a secure future for people with disabilities. The Government assists these families by contributing through grants and bonds that supplement contributions.

=== Tax-Free Savings Account ===
In Budget 2008, Flaherty introduced the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), a flexible, registered, general-purpose savings vehicle that allows Canadians to earn tax-free investment income to more easily meet lifetime savings needs.

The measure, which came into effect on January 2, 2009, has clear differences with the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). There is a tax deduction for contributions to an RRSP, and withdrawals of contributions and investment income are all taxable. In contrast, there are no tax deductions for contributions to a TFSA. Beginning in 2013, contribution room in the TFSA has increased to $5,500 per calendar year. The Canada Revenue Agency describes the difference between the TFSA and an RRSP as follows: &quot;An RRSP is primarily intended for retirement. The TFSA is like an RRSP for everything else in your life.&quot;

Flaherty&#x27;s measure was supported by many organizations, including the C.D. Howe Institute, which stated: &quot;This tax policy gem is very good news for Canadians, and Mr. Flaherty and his government deserve credit for a novel program.&quot;

=== EUROMoney Magazine ===
In 2009, Flaherty received an award from EUROMoney Magazine, naming him Finance Minister of the Year. Flaherty is the first Canadian to hold this honour. It says he &quot;enhanced his country&#x27;s reputation for sound fiscal policy that takes full account of social justice, while a strong regulatory regime has kept the financial sector out of the chaos.&quot;

=== Federation of Canadian Municipalities report on infrastructure ===

Flaherty responded to a report from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities that suggested that cities had an infrastructure deficit of $123 billion and the federal government should step up with some cash with the suggestion cities should stop &quot;whining&quot; and repair their own crumbling infrastructure.

Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier claimed Flaherty sidestepped responsibility for billions in infrastructure dollars being sought, when Flaherty advised municipalities to &quot;do their job&quot; because the feds are &quot;not in the pothole business&quot;. &quot;Let’s get on with the job and stop complaining about it and do their job&quot;, Flaherty continued, noting the Building Canada fund will inject $33 billion into cities to help deal with the infrastructure crunch. However Bronconnier said the plan is merely a &quot;repackaging&quot; of a number of pre-existing funding arrangements. The Building Canada Fund was strongly criticized for being designed to fail, due to excessive red tape, which has delayed much of the funding from being awarded.

Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion went further by issuing a challenge to Flaherty to publicly debate the need for permanent federal funding for the repair and upkeep of municipal roads and bridges. McCallion said &quot;Flaherty has stated in the media that some of the municipalities have not kept up with infrastructure and did not establish adequate reserves. Well, I can tell him that he is dead wrong. The facts are that Mississauga has carefully set aside reserves for infrastructure for years.&quot; McCallion noted that cities are trying to maintain 58 per cent of public infrastructure with eight cents of every tax dollar. Flaherty did not accept Hazel McCallion&#x27;s offer to debate.

=== Department of Finance contracts questioned ===
Flaherty said his office broke government contracting rules in hiring MacPhie &amp; Company to help write the 2007 budget speech and provide advice on how to sell the document. MacPhie &amp; Company was awarded the $122,000 contract without tender by Flaherty&#x27;s office. On February 7, 2008, Liberal finance critic John McCallum formally called on Auditor General Sheila Fraser to conduct an audit into the untendered contract awarded by Flaherty to MacPhie &amp; Company for work done in advance of the 2007 budget.

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; determined that several people who supported Flaherty when he was an Ontario cabinet minister or who supported his two failed bids to lead the Ontario Tories were awarded employment contracts or given appointments. The employment contracts awarded were under the $25,000 Treasury Board contract bidding limit. Bronwen Evans received a $24,877.50 contract to write speeches for Flaherty from June 2006 until last February. David Curtain, who worked on Flaherty&#x27;s Ontario leadership campaign, received $24,877.50 to write the finance minister&#x27;s first budget speech. Curtain was also paid $3,350 to write a keynote address earlier in 2008 for Flaherty. Lawyer James Love, who donated $63,000 to Flaherty over two leadership campaigns, was appointed to the Royal Canadian Mint. Another Flaherty donor, Carol Hansell, was appointed to the board of directors of the Bank of Canada in October 2006. Toronto family law lawyer Sara Beth Mintz, an Ontario Progressive Conservative Party vice-president, received $24,900 for budget &quot;analysis, assessment and advice&quot;. MacPhie &amp; Company also got another contract for $24,645 for work done on Advantage Canada, a long-term, national economic plan. Opposition parties said they were suspicious that contracts were coming in just under $25,000 in order to give business to Flaherty&#x27;s friends and supporters.

On May 13, 2008, Flaherty appeared before the Public Accounts committee, facing questions about multiple sole-sourced contracts worth more than $300,000 that were given by the government. Flaherty says he was unaware his former chief of staff broke government rules in handing a well-connected Tory an untendered contract to write the 2007 budget speech.

=== Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ===
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is American legislation that requires cooperation, legal and financial, from Canada (and other nations), in order to be implemented. The official reason given for this legislation was efforts to crack down on tax evasion. However, in a letter Flaherty sent to U.S. newspapers in September 2011, he said the law would waste resources and raise privacy concerns. On February 5, 2014, Flaherty signed Canada on as a participant to FATCA through an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA).

=== Abolishing the penny ===
While announcing Economic Action Plan 2012 on March 29 in the House of Commons, Flaherty explained that, by February 2013, the government would be phasing out the penny. The cost to produce each new penny was 1.6 cents, which exceeded the penny&#x27;s face value by 0.6 cents. The estimated savings for taxpayers from phasing out the penny is about $11 million a year. Even though the government eliminated the penny from circulation, Canadians can continue to use pennies for cash transactions indefinitely for businesses that choose to accept them or they can redeem rolled pennies at their financial institutions.

=== Public-private partnerships ===

The now defunct Crown Corporation PPP Canada was created during Flaherty&#x27;s tenure to highlight the commitment of the federal government to Public-private partnerships (PPP, P3). It was responsible for promoting and facilitating Public-private partnerships, and operated under Infrastructure Canada. PPP Canada managed the “P3 Canada fund” where provinces, territories, and municipalities could apply for funding from the federal government. PP Canada served as Canada&#x27;s centralized PPP Unit from its creation in 2009 until it was dissolved in 2018 under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Flaherty intended to fund most of Canada&#x27;s new infrastructure though Public-private partnerships. He intervened in the 2013 Regina wastewater plant funding referendum, during which he wrote an open letter arguing that voters should select the P3 option. His arguments included the promise of allocating $58.5 million of federal funding if the P3 option is selected.

=== Building Canada Plan ===
On May 21, 2013, Flaherty introduced his 2013 Budget. The Budget contained a new Building Canada Plan for the construction of public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, transit and port facilities. The plan provides $53 billion in investments to support local and economic infrastructure projects, including more than $47 billion in new funding over 10 years, starting in 2014–2015.

=== Budgets presented ===
Flaherty presented nine budgets to the Canadian Parliament as Minister of Finance.
* 2006 Canadian federal budget
* 2007 Canadian federal budget
* 2008 Canadian federal budget
* 2009 Canadian federal budget
* 2010 Canadian federal budget
* 2011 Canadian federal budget (presented in March 2011 and again in June).
* 2012 Canadian federal budget
* 2013 Canadian federal budget
* 2014 Canadian federal budget

=== Resignation from Cabinet ===
On March 18, 2014, Flaherty announced that he was resigning as Minister of Finance in order to return to the private sector. While he had openly discussed health challenges associated with managing bullous pemphigoid, including taking prescription steroids, he said the decision was reached after many months of consultation with his family and that his health was not a factor in his decision. Flaherty continued sitting in the House of Commons as an MP until his death three weeks later. At the time of his resignation, he held the honour of being the &quot;Longest continuous serving cabinet minister in a single portfolio&quot; in the 28th Canadian Ministry.

== Honours ==
An office building in Ottawa, housing employees from the Department of Finance, is named after Flaherty.

With the 2017 Canada Day Honours, Flaherty was awarded with a posthumous Meritorious Service Cross.


== Personal life and death ==
Flaherty grew up in a Catholic family in Montreal, and was of part Irish descent. As a youth he was an avid hockey player and won a hockey scholarship to Princeton University.

Those familiar with Flaherty&#x27;s work as a lawyer noted his dogged determination and a strong work ethic. One colleague, Hamilton lawyer John Soule said, &quot;He is a driven person ... and certainly is prepared to do what is necessary in terms of time and hard work to achieve what he believes is right&quot;. He assisted in several volunteer causes, including being the president of the Head Injury Association of Durham Region in Ontario.

His wife, Christine Elliott, was the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament for Oshawa–Whitby, east of Toronto and Deputy Leader of the Opposition until her resignation in August 2015. The couple lived in Whitby and have triplet sons John, Galen and Quinn, who were born in 1991. His son Galen, used to work for Doug Ford who was then a member of Toronto City Council. Elliott and Flaherty have both championed issues surrounding children with disabilities; their son, John, has a disability.

In his final years, Flaherty underwent a marked change in his physical appearance including significant weight gain. In January 2013, Flaherty announced he had bullous pemphigoid. He was treated with prednisone, a powerful steroid for which side effects such as those suffered by Flaherty are well-documented. Flaherty died on April 10, 2014, at his home in Ottawa after suffering a heart attack at the age of 64.

A state funeral was held for Flaherty on April 16, 2014, at St. James Cathedral in Toronto.

<text>The Seeds of Death is the fifth serial of the sixth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Written by Brian Hayles and an uncredited Terrance Dicks and directed by Michael Ferguson, it originally aired in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 25 January to 1 March 1969. It sees the return of the Ice Warriors, previously introduced by Hayles in the 1967 serial &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot;.

The serial is set in London and on the Moon in the late 21st century. In the serial, the time traveller the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his travelling companions Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), along with the technicians Gia Kelly (Louise Pajo) and Phipps (Christopher Coll), try to prevent the Ice Warriors&#x27; plot to make the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere inhospitable to humans but viable for the Ice Warriors to invade.

==Plot==
At the end of the twenty-first century, a teleportation technology called &quot;T-Mat&quot; has replaced all traditional forms of transport, allowing people and objects to travel instantly anywhere on Earth. Crewed space exploration has ceased. The Doctor, Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot arrive in a museum on Earth run by Professor Daniel Eldred dedicated to the obsolete technology of rockets. However, something goes amiss at the T-Mat vital relay station on the Moon and the system breaks down. With communications out, and no way to reach the Moon without T-Mat, those responsible for the system, Commander Radnor and his assistant Gia Kelly, turn to Professor Eldred to help. He has been privately building a rocket in hopes of re-igniting interest in space travel. The Doctor and his companions volunteer to crew the rocket. The Doctor also comments that the TARDIS is not suitable for short range use after Zoe informs Jamie that the TARDIS would most likely overshoot by a couple of million years.

The relay station on the Moon has been invaded by Ice Warriors, a militant Martian race, who plan to use it as a staging point for an invasion of Earth. The technicians attempt to fight the invaders but several are killed, while Phipps goes into hiding and Fewsham is pressed into assisting the invaders. Fewsham repairs the T-Mat link on receive mode and Miss Kelly beams through to start repairing the T-Mat system.

When the Doctor and his companions arrive on the Moon they make contact with Phipps, who is hiding in the moonbase. The Doctor accidentally reveals himself to the Ice Warriors and their leader Commander Slaar. The Ice Warriors have a deadly plan: they have seeds, which they send to various parts of Earth using T-mat, of a fungus that will multiply and suck all the oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere, making it more comfortable for the Martians but uninhabitable for humans. Once the full T-Mat relay is repaired, one seed is sent to Earth Control and explodes, killing a technician and alerting Radnor and Eldred of the danger. The seed soon creates foam, which multiplies its effects and imperils more and more people. Other T-Mat terminals across the world receive more seeds. The Ice Warriors also use T-Mat to dispatch a small advance force to seize Earth&#x27;s weather control systems in London and ensure good conditions for the growth of the fungus.

On the Moon Miss Kelly and Phipps work with Zoe and Jamie to stage diversions and attacks against the Ice Warriors. During their main assault to free the Doctor, Phipps is killed. The Ice Warriors have now retreated to their spacecraft to plan the next stage of their invasion, leaving an opportunity for most of the captives to flee. Fewsham, however, remains behind, seemingly fearing an enquiry into his actions if he returns to Earth.

In T-Mat control on Earth, the Doctor works out that the seed pods can be defeated using water. This explains where the Ice Warrior beamed to Earth has gone, and the Doctor tracks him down to the weather control system, where the alien has been stationed to prevent any rain fall that would be deadly to the pods. The Doctor and his allies recapture the weather control system and summon rain, destroying the fungus, which is used to the dry conditions on Mars.

Fewsham has meanwhile delivered a crushing blow to the Ice Warriors. He dupes Slaar into revealing in a live link with Earth that the main invasion force is following a homing signal to the Moon, for which he is killed. But at least the Doctor now knows the full extent of the Ice Warrior plans. He returns to the moonbase by T-mat to set a new signal for the Martian fleet from there. The Doctor confronts Slaar while substituting the alternative signal. This draws the Martian fleet away and lures it into the Sun. Slaar moves to kill the Doctor in revenge but the arrival of Jamie in a T-Mat cubicle causes chaos, and Slaar is killed in one of the sonic beams of the last of his warriors. Jamie then kills the surviving Martian and the invasion is over. The Doctor and Jamie return to Earth and then make their goodbyes before departing in the TARDIS with Zoe.

==Production==

Although Brian Hayles is solely credited as the story&#x27;s author, series script editor Terrance Dicks rewrote Episodes 3 to 6 of the script. This was partly because he considered Hayles&#x27;s original ending lacklustre and unworkable, but also because originally Jamie McCrimmon was to have been replaced by a new companion called Nik by this story; actor Frazer Hines postponed his departure, however. Dicks was co-credited on the sleeve of the VHS release for his writing duties on the serial.

Patrick Troughton does not appear in Episode 4 as he was on holiday when it was being recorded. A double stands in for him in some shots where the Doctor is seen unconscious on the floor.

===Cast notes===
This story is the first story to feature Alan Bennion in the role of an Ice Lord, this one named Slaar. Bennion would return as the Ice Lords Izlyr in &quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot; (1972) and Azaxyr in &quot;The Monster of Peladon&quot; (1974). Sonny Caldinez, who played Slaar&#x27;s second in command, is the only actor to appear as an Ice Warrior in all four televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories in the classic series to feature the Ice Warriors. Caldinez also appeared as Kemel in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967). Ronald Leigh-Hunt played Commander Radnor in this story. Leigh-Hunt would play Commander Stevenson in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975). Harry Towb later played McDermott in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (1971). Christopher Coll would later play Stubbs in &quot;The Mutants&quot; (1972). Steve Peters, who played an Ice Warrior, was billed simply as &quot;Alien&quot; in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; listing for episode one, so as not to spoil the surprise of the Ice Warriors&#x27; appearance.

==Commercial releases==

<doc id="550216" wikidata="Q3428537" url="?curid=550216" title="USS Arthur W. Radford">
<text>USS &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; (DD-968) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Admiral Arthur W. Radford USN (1896–1973), the first naval officer to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She was decommissioned on 18 March 2003 after serving for 26 years, and on 10 August 2011 her hull was scuttled off the coast of Delaware to form part of an artificial reef.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was laid down 31 January 1974 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and launched on 1 March 1975, sponsored by Mrs. Arthur Radford, the admiral&#x27;s widow. &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was commissioned on 16 April 1977,

== Early operations ==
Underway for the United States East Coast the day she was commissioned, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was forced to return to her builder&#x27;s yard for repairs soon thereafter, but got underway again on 30 April. Touching at Charleston, South Carolina, on 3 and 4 May, the ship proceeded to her home port Norfolk, Virginia, which she reached on 6 May.

Three days later, she steamed for Newport, Rhode Island, to provide support for the Naval Surface Warfare Officer Training Command. While the ship proceeded north, a LAMPS helicopter practice-landed on her helo deck to prepare for the embarkation of a LAMPS III detachment. The helicopter returned to Norfolk later that day 11 May. Mooring at Newport on 13 May, the destroyer remained there until 17 May, when she headed home. Soon after returning to Norfolk, she conducted gunnery exercises and helicopter operations off the Virginia Capes.

The ship headed down the coast on 24 May and reached Port Canaveral, Florida, the following day. After embarking Capt. R. K. Albright, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 22 (DesRon 22) the destroyer got underway on 27 May and, for the next few days, conducted air, surface, and sub-surface surveillance of the surrounding waters while President Jimmy Carter, observed operations on board the attack submarine . The destroyer rendezvoused with the submarine prior to her initial dive and then again when the submarine surfaced. Throughout the operation, she provided support services for local and national press covering the Chief Executive&#x27;s voyage.

Underway for Norfolk on 31 May, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; reached her home port on 2 June for local operations. While returning from waters off the Virginia Capes on 6 June, the ship ran into low-visibility conditions and winds in excess of 90 knots (170 km/h) which disabled a radar antenna and drove the ship outside the main shipping channel. At one point her fathometer read only 30 centimeters of water under the keel.

Fighting her way back to the channel in the teeth of the gale &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sighted a capsized motor vessel, &quot;Dixie Lee II&quot;, south of Thimble A Shoals Channel buoy 21. Unable to assist due to the shallow water and high winds, the destroyer notified the United States Coast Guard of bodies seen floating in the water. The destroyer then anchored in Hampton Roads until the wind had dropped and shipping, adrift in the vicinity, had moved off.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; then proceeded to the West Indies for training operations including gunfire support. En route to Frederickstad, Saint Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in late June she conducted further weapons tests. Firing a gunnery exercise at Vieques, Puerto Rico, the destroyer returned to the eastern seaboard with a port visit to Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Independence Day 1977. During this firing exercise, a dummy shell hit which was towing a target sled. Further work in the Bahamas, and at Guantanamo Bay, preceded her return to Charleston, South Carolina, on the last day of July. She then headed home where she arrived on 3 August.

The ship returned to Pascagoula on 11 September for post-shakedown availability and remained in her builder&#x27;s hands until she returned to Norfolk in mid-October. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 25 October for restricted availability, she remained there into the spring of 1978 before resuming local operations out of her home port. She principally engaged in ship qualification trials and underway training before steaming south to Guantanamo Bay and Vieques for refresher training and gunfire support practice, respectively. Following these evolutions, the ship returned to Norfolk on 30 July 1978.

On 23 August, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; got underway from the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown Virginia, and headed for NATO exercises in the North Atlantic. En route, she participated in Exercise &quot;Common Effort&quot;, carrying out escort duties in an &quot;opposed Atlantic transit&quot;, and briefly embarked Vice Admiral Wesley L. McDonald, Commander, U.S. 2nd Fleet. Next came Operation &quot;Northern Wedding&quot; a joint NATO exercise which began on 4 September and involved several carrier groups in an amphibious landing and many other facets of simulated naval warfare. During that operation, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; operated alongside Royal Navy, Royal Danish Navy, Royal Norwegian Navy, Swedish Navy, West German Navy, and Canadian Forces Maritime naval units. During this exercise, the ship encountered huge seas from Hurricane Flossie.

Following the conclusion of &quot;Northern Wedding&quot;, the destroyer visited Copenhagen, Denmark; Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Portsmouth, England. She again embarked VADM McDonald at Portsmouth on 16 October and wore his flag during the return voyage to Norfolk. The admiral disembarked upon her arrival at Norfolk on 25 October. The destroyer then operated locally through the winter, varying periods between in port for upkeep and getting underway for training.

== First deployment and interim ==
&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; cleared Norfolk on 13 March 1979, bound for the Mediterranean and a tour with the U.S. 6th Fleet. Over the next six months, she participated in a variety of exercises and visited the ports of Catania, Sicily; Split, Yugoslavia; Trieste, Italy; Alexandria, Egypt; Cannes, France, Palma, Spain; Barcelona, Spain; Toulon, France, Théoule, France, Rota, Spain and Valencia, Spain. During the deployment, the vessel fired her first Harpoon missile in the Mediterranean on 28 July. Her target was the hulk of a destroyer, ex- (later the Turkish TCG &quot;Gaziantep&quot; (D-344)). &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; also participated in Exercise &quot;Multiplex 1-79&quot; in the Ionian Sea, Exercise &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; in the Tyrrhenian Sea and Ionian Seas, Exercise &quot;Tridente&quot; out of Alexandria, and Exercise &quot;National Week&quot; XXVII, Phases 1 and 2. While en route from Toulon to Theoule, France, she rescued the French ketch, &quot;Laurca&quot;, adrift from the French resort of St. Tropez.

Clearing Rota on 12 September, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; reached Norfolk on 22 September. Underway for Miami, Florida on 23 October, she served as the platform for deck landing qualifications for helicopter pilots en route, and, after touching at Mayport, Florida to unload a crippled H 3 helicopter from HSL-30, reached Miami on 27 October for a two-day port visit.

After returning briefly to Norfolk from 31 October to 5 November, the destroyer proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and participated in a training exercise with American and Canadian warships. During the course of Exercise &quot;Canus-Marcot&quot; she logged her 1,000th helicopter landing of 1979. Returning to Norfolk on 21 November, she remained in port for the remainder of the year 1979.

For the first half of 1980, the warship principally operated off the eastern seaboard of the United States, and ranged as far north as Halifax and as far south as the Caribbean, working briefly out of Vieques and Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, as well as out of Jacksonville, Florida. During this time, she also visited Annapolis, Maryland, where United States Naval Academy midshipmen toured the ship&#x27;s engineering plant on an orientation visit. Admiral James L. Holloway III, the former Chief of Naval Operations, visited the ship as well.

== Second deployment and interim ==

Following a brief period at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; prepared for another extended deployment. She departed Norfolk on 21 June 1980, embarking HSL-34, Detachment 2 and proceeded to Roosevelt Roads, where she embarked Rear Admiral Peter K. Cullins, Commander, South Atlantic Force and his staff to become Cullins&#x27; flagship for UNITAS XXI. Visits to Saint Kitts and to Bridgetown, Barbados, followed before the destroyer sailed for Venezuelan waters.

Over the next four months, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; operated with elements of the Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Colombian, Trinidad and Tobagonian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Brazilian navies. Her ports of call included Puerto La Cruz and La Guaira, Venezuela, Rodman, Panama, Manta, Ecuador, Paito and Callao, Peru, Cartagena, Colombia; Trinidad and Tobago, Puerto Belgrano, and Bahía Blanca, Argentina, Montevideo, Uruguay, and the Brazilian ports of Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Recife. She also transited the Panama Canal twice during UNITAS XXI, the first time on 21 July 1980 and the second on 24 August.

Completing UNITAS XXI on 4 November, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sailed for Gabon, as a unit of the West Africa Training Cruise (WATC), reaching Libreville, the capital of Gabon, on 12 November. Over the next few weeks, she visited Tema, Ghana Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Dakar, Senegal. Clearing Dakar on 1 December, the destroyer stopped at Guadeloupe and at Roosevelt Roads on the return voyage and arrived at Norfolk on 15 December.

The ship spent the next two years engaged in operations along the East Coast and in the West Indies mostly in underway training out of Norfolk, Roosevelt Roads, and Vieques and in refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. During the summer of 1981, she operated out of Annapolis, training midshipmen. She underwent upkeep at Norfolk and Boston, Massachusetts, and received an overhaul at her builder&#x27;s yard. En route to Puerto Rico, the ship had a Coast Guard detachment embarked from 20 to 23 September 1982, and cooperated with the Coast Guard on drug interdiction duties.

== Third deployment and interim ==
For the first few months of 1983, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; operated primarily in the Virginia Capes area, but ranged into the Atlantic as far as the Bahamas. After embarking Commander, Destroyer Squadron 26, at Norfolk on 7 March to begin a nine-month period on board, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; hosted Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, Jr., on 29 March. A little less than one month later the destroyer cleared Norfolk on 27 April for a six-month deployment in the Mediterranean.

Touching at Gibraltar on 10 May, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; proceeded to Augusta Bay, Sicily, and thence moved to waters off the coast of Lebanon. After supporting the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut from 20 to 28 May, the destroyer visited Taranto, Italy, before returning to Lebanese waters for another brief period. During a port call at the Romanian port of Constanţa along with guided-missile frigate , the destroyer served as flagship for Vice Admiral William H. Rowden, Commander, 6th Fleet.

Visiting Catania, Sicily, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and Livorno, Italy, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; exercised with U.S. 6th Fleet battle groups later that summer, later visiting Gaeta and Naples, Italy. While visiting Istanbul, Turkey, she hosted the retired Army leader and former presidential advisor General Alexander M. Haig.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; returned to the waters off Beirut on 18 September 1983 to assume duty as ready gunfire support ship. She conducted gunfire support missions against forces threatening the peacekeeping force on 21 and 22 September until relieved on station by the battleship on 8 October. Visits to La Maddalena, Sardinia, and to Tangier, Morocco rounded out the destroyer&#x27;s time in the U.S. 6th Fleet. Operating briefly with Spanish Navy units en route to the turnover port of Rota, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; cleared Rota on 10 November with the battle group formed around the carrier . She arrived at Norfolk 11 days later, remaining there for the rest of 198

3.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; operated briefly in the Virginia Capes area in January 1984 before undergoing an overhaul at the Metro Machine Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, between 16 February and 27 April. Subsequently, undergoing sea trials and repairs in the floating drydock , &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; conducted routine training out of Norfolk through early August.

The destroyer next operated out of Roosevelt Roads and off St. Croix before returning to Norfolk at the end of August and becoming flagship for Destroyer Squadron 10. After then conducting underway training in the Virginia Capes area in September and October, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; accompanied the recommissioned battleship to Roosevelt Roads. She later conducted gunfire support exercises off Vieques. Returning northward the destroyer took part in exercises off the coast of North Carolina before reaching to Norfolk on 20 November.

== Fourth deployment and interim ==
After local operations, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sailed for a deployment with the Middle East Force (MidEastFor) on 4 February 1985, in company with . Rendezvousing with and near Bermuda two days later, and refueling from , the destroyer reached Rota on 16 February. She then visited Naples before heading for Egypt to transit the Suez Canal on 27 February 1985.

The destroyer touched briefly at Raysut, Oman, on 8 March before transiting the Strait of Hormuz the following day and entering the Persian Gulf. After touching briefly at Bahrain &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; got underway on 14 March for the Persian Gulf radar picket station. Five days into her time on station, she responded to a &quot;Mayday&quot; from the Liberian-flag tanker &quot;Caribbean Breeze&quot; which had been attacked and set afire in the central Persian Gulf. The destroyer provided medical advice over the emergency radio channel and launched a helicopter to render assistance.

Refueling on 25 March at Sitrah Anchorage, Bahrain, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; got underway to resume her radar picket duty later the same day, remaining employed thus until she moored alongside for availability. The destroyer resumed steaming on radar picket station again on 8 April, also conducting surveillance operations simultaneously.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; embarked Rear Admiral John Addams, Commander, Middle East Force, on 17 April, and served as his flagship until 5 June. During that time, the destroyer served twice on radar picket duties in the Persian Gulf, the first from 17 to 26 April and the second from 23 to 29 June, and once on routine cruising. She visited the Sitrah anchorage twice during this period, and visited Manama, Bahrain, twice.

After Rear Admiral Addams shifted his flag from &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot;, the ship served two more tours of radar picket duty in the Persian Gulf from 6 to 16 June and 20 to 29 June. During the first of these periods, on 7 June, the destroyer&#x27;s embarked Sikorsky SH-3 &quot;Sea King&quot; helicopter from squadron HS-1 transported a civilian rescued from drowning and in need of medical attention to Bahrain hospital, saving the person&#x27;s life.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; underwent her final upkeep in the Persian Gulf at Mina Sulman, Manama, Bahrain, from 29 June to 4 July observing Independence Day there before getting underway that afternoon to transit the Persian Gulf for the Strait of Hormuz. She conducted turnover to the destroyer the following day, and exited from the gulf.

Stopping for fuel at Mina Raysut, Oman, on 8 July, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; transited the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb in company with &quot;Antrim&quot; on 10 July, and the two warships conducted freedom of navigation operations off the coast of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen on 11 July. The destroyer transited the Suez Canal on 14 July, and replenished from the oiler that same day. Fueling from the following day, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; conducted a port visit to Benidorm, Spain, from 20 to 23 July before reaching Rota on 24 July. Proceeding thence with &quot;Antrim&quot;, &quot;Barney&quot;, and &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;, the destroyer sailed for Norfolk on 24 July. After visiting Ponta Delgada, Azores, and Bermuda en route, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; reached her home port on 5 August 1985.

The destroyer remained at Norfolk into late October, preparing for a command inspection and operating locally in the Virginia Capes operating area. Early in this period, Hurricane Gloria prompted &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; to depart Norfolk on 13 September 1985, and proceed to the upper Chesapeake Bay anchorage to ride out the storm. The destroyer returned to her home port on 21 September.

Departing Norfolk on 25 October, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sailed for Nova Scotia, and arrived at Halifax on 28 October. After being briefed for her participation in an exercise, SHAREM 62, the ship departed Halifax on the following day for Notre Dame Bay Newfoundland. Transiting the Strait of Belle Isle on 31 October &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; reached her destination on 1 November, and took part in SHAREM 62 until 6 November, when she sailed for Halifax.
Following the post-exercise debriefing, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sailed for Norfolk, arriving at her home port on 13 November. Moving up the eastern seaboard, the destroyer visited Boston, Massachusetts (5 to 8 December) before spending a brief period at Newport serving as Surface Warfare Officer School school ship from 9 to 12 December. &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; then returned to the Norfolk area, unloading weapons at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown from 15 to 18 December before conducting a dependents&#x27; cruise on 18 December.

The destroyer underwent a restricted availability until late March 1986, running her post-repair trials on 29 and 30 March before proceeding to Yorktown to take on weapons. &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; operated locally out of Norfolk into late July, interspersing this work with a drydocking in &quot;Sustain&quot; from 30 May to 17 June, for repairs to her struts and stern tubes, as well as an inspection of her sonar dome. Following refresher training in Guantanamo Bay, the ship touched at Roosevelt Roads before operating at Vieques for gunfire support practice, surface gunnery exercises, and missile shoots. After visiting Fort Lauderdale, and Florida en route, the ship returned to Norfolk on 12 September.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; returned to Guantanamo Bay soon thereafter to embark HSL-36, detachment 6, and then proceeded to Roosevelt Roads, where she arrived on 6 October to load ammunition, to take on fuel, and to embark a Coast Guard law enforcement detachment along with Commander, Caribbean Squadron and his staff. The ship operated in her assigned waters from 6 to 19 October, returning to Roosevelt Roads to debark Commander, Caribbean Squadron and his staff.

Detaching the Coast Guardsmen at Nassau, Bahamas, on 22 October at the commencement of the ship&#x27;s port visit there, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sailed for Norfolk on 25 October, arriving two days later. As before, her stay in port proved brief, for she got underway on 3 November for the Bermuda operating area for exercises. One day out of Norfolk, she assisted in searching for a crewman who had been lost in the Cape Hatteras area.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; conducted her exercises, SHAREM 1-87, before returning to Norfolk on 16 November. With the exception of a period underway in the Virginia Capes operating area on 9 and 10 December, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; spent the month of December in port in Norfolk. In early 1987, the ship participated in a major FLEETEX and other exercises, and from 20 July to 10 December 1987, the ship took part in UNITAS XXVIII.

A vertical launching system (VLS) was installed in January 1990 during a major overhaul at Avondale Shipyard. On 26 September 1991, the ship departed for a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf with the &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; battle group, returning 26 March 1992. It was her first deployment in five years.

The ship deployed to the Mediterranean sea in 1994 and in 1996. The ship and crew received awards for service relating to Bosnia during both deployments.

== Later career and collision ==

As of 31 August 1995, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was to become part of Destroyer Squadron 26.

In May 1997, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; received the first shipboard installation of the Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor System which fully integrates advanced materials, structures, and manufacturing technologies with sensor technology, electromagnetics, and signature reduction to achieve improved warfighting capabilities.

On 4 February 1999 at about 23:34, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; collided with the &quot;Saudi Riyadh&quot;, () a 29,259-ton, -long, roll-on/roll-off container ship, which was preparing to enter the Chesapeake Bay bound for Baltimore. According to the Navy, &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was conducting calibration tests on electronic warfare equipment at the time of the collision. As a part of that test, the ship had been sailing in circles around an electronic buoy for six hours prior to the collision. &quot;Saudi Riyadh&quot;, meanwhile, was approaching the Chesapeake Bay from the northeast, preparing to line up in the shipping lanes before taking on a marine pilot for its eventual trip to Baltimore.

When the two ships collided, &quot;Saudi Riyadh&quot;″s bow struck the starboard side of &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot;, about behind its bow. &quot;Saudi Riyadh&quot; sustained a four-foot-high, -long gash along the port and starboard sides of its bow, with most of the damage to its port side. &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot;, more heavily damaged, sustained a deep gash on its starboard side, penetrating nearly into the main deck, ripping a pie-shaped gash and penetrating into the centerline of &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot;. A hole ran from the deck to the waterline. The collision toppled its 5-inch 54-caliber gun and damaged Tomahawk cruise missile tubes. One sailor aboard suffered a broken arm, and 12 more had various injuries. The ship entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard Drydock #3 25 February 1999.
&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; sustained an estimated $32.7 million in damages and the damage prevented the ship from leaving 26 March on a scheduled six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea with the carrier battle group. Repairs aboard &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; were completed on 13 September and the destroyer then deployed with the battle group. As a result of the collision, the commanding officer was relieved 13 February 1999. In June 2000, a US court affixed liability at 65% &quot;Saudi Riyadh&quot; / 35% &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot;. Neither the US Navy commanding officer nor the cargo ship&#x27;s master were on the bridge or consulted prior to the collision.

&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf 3 April to 1 October 2000.

== Decommissioning and fate ==
&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was decommissioned 18 March 2003, then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 April 2004 and eventually assigned to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 8 June 2010, the ex-&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; was transferred to the State of Delaware for preparation for eventual sinking as an artificial reef onto the Del-Jersey-Land Inshore Reef site on a project led by Captain Tim Mullane of The American Marine Group (), about southeast of Cape May, New Jersey, and northeast of Ocean City, Maryland.

After being scuttled on 10 August 2011, the ship became part of the largest artificial reef on the U.S. East Coast and the longest vessel to be used for this purpose in the Atlantic.

<text>Bad Blankenburg () is a spa town in the district of Saalfeld-Rudolstadt, in Thuringia, Germany. It is situated 6 km southwest of Rudolstadt, and 37 km southeast of Erfurt. It is most famous for being the location of the first kindergarten of Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel, in 1837.

To the north of it, on an eminence, rise the fine ruins of the castle of Greifenstein, built by the German king Henry I, and from 1275 to 1583 the seat of a cadet branch of the counts of Schwarzburg.

In the nineteenth century, Bad Blankenburg was part of the small principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.

Bad Blankenburg is the headquarters of Deutsche Evangelische Allianz, a cooperative network of most Protestant churches in Germany.

<doc id="550223" wikidata="Q1415628" url="?curid=550223" title="Marching">
<text>Marching refers to the organized, uniformed, steady walking forward in either rhythmic or route-step time; and, typically, it refers to overland movements on foot of military troops and units under field orders. Marching is often performed to march music and is typically associated with military and civilian ceremonial parades. It is a major part of military basic training in most countries and usually involves a system of drill commands. It can also be used as a general term to describe a protest in which protestors move such as the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a watershed moment in the civil rights movement.

== Purpose ==
It is said that many ancient empires first developed marching as a way to move troops from one place to another without them getting mixed up with other troops. A soldier learning to march to drum cadences, martial music and shouted commands is considered an essential element of teaching military discipline.

In the United States Marine Corps, close order drill is used to promote exercise, obeying orders, discipline, morale, confidence, and leadership.

== Military paces ==
In the military venue there are various rhythmic military steps or standard paces. One step occurs on each beat. A pace is the length of one step, assumed to be 75 cm or 30&quot;; (not to be confused with the ancient Roman unit of length (2 steps or 5 Roman feet = 148 cm or 58&quot;)). The three most common paces are: 

* Quick March: The basic mobility. 120 beats per minute (beats/min. or bpm). In the US this is called &quot;quick time&quot;.
* Double March: The basic run. 180 beats/min. In the US this is called &quot;double time&quot;.
* Slow March: Ceremonial pace, 60 beats/min.
Some paces specific to particular units include:

* British armed services:
** RAF, Royal Navy, and the army except the Rifles: Quick March 116 beats/min., Slow March 65 beats/min.
** Rifles March: Quick March 140 beats/min. (like double-time, this is a rapid trot, with the rifle usually carried at the trail, not on the shoulder), Slow March 70 beats/min.
** Highland March: Regiment-specific pace, 80 beats/min. when wearing kilts.

* French Foreign Legion Pace: 88 beats/min
* Paso Legionario: Specific march used by the Spanish Legion, 144 beats/min, embodiment of their &quot;espíritu de marcha&quot;.
* Typical German speed is 112 beats/min.

== Techniques ==
Marching techniques vary across military steps, countries, branches of military, and context. For rhythmic marching, individuals must maintain their &quot;dress&quot;, &quot;cover&quot;, &quot;interval&quot;, and &quot;distance&quot; (DCID):
* &quot;dress&quot; — alignment with the person to the side;
* &quot;cover&quot; — alignment with the person in front;
* &quot;interval&quot; — space between the person(s) to the side;
* &quot;distance&quot; — space between the person in front. 

For mechanical efficiency, opposite arms usually swing with each leg while marching. British and Commonwealth armed forces keep their arms straight and swing the hand as high as the shoulder while forward and in theory to the level of the belt when backward. US Marines swing the arm six inches to the front and three inches to the rear while US Army Soldiers swing the arm nine inches to the front and six inches to the rear. Some European armies bend the arm during the swing. Many believe these differing practices help maintain rhythm for long route marches. US troops usually march long distances at &quot;route step&quot; which does not require them to maintain a specific pace or length of step. Some South American and Eastern European countries march on parade with the stiff leg earlier famous as the &quot;goose step&quot; of German troops. German and Scandinavian military bands and units swing with only the right arm, 90 degrees straight out. Some troops (like the Royal Swedish Lifeguard) swing with their left arm. This is because they carry their rifle in their right arm. 
The Royal Marines refer to a long distance march carrying full kit as a yomp. The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 Falklands War. 

== Parades and protest ==

For some people, marching is a major provocative ritual. In Northern Ireland, for example, hundreds of marches occur annually. These are usually organized by groups such as the Orange Order, which provide most of the participants. Music is provided by marching bands including silver bands, flute bands and others. Marching is often seen as a symbol of control over a particular area, and marching is often seen as a sectarian activity. 

Marching is often used - in the UK at least - during Armistice Day as a show of respect to those who fell during all wars and is done at the &quot;slow march&quot; from a pre-defined meeting place to the cenotaph. The march usually consists of Active Duty and Retired Military Personnel, Cadet Corps, Relatives and volunteer civilians.

During the civil rights movement, marches across cities were used as method to protest against civil injustice by civil disobedience, such as causing blockades, shutting down infrastructure, and to make protestors goals known.

1994 - Haitian operations. July and August 1994 saw &quot;Peterson&quot; off the coast of Haiti where she provided support for Operation Uphold Democracy.

=== 1995-2000 ===
1995 - Mediterranean deployment and selected restricted availability (SRA). On 14 April 1995 &quot;Peterson&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia culminating a highly successful Mediterranean deployment as a member of the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; battle group. While on deployment, &quot;Peterson&quot; played an active role in several community service projects including the highly visible &quot;Project Handclasp&quot; program. On 22 October &quot;Peterson&quot; commenced a three and a half month SRA which included the installation of the state of the art Tomahawk Weapons Control System (ATWCS). &quot;Peterson&quot; earned Destroyer Squadron Twenty Eight&#x27;s battle efficiency award for 1995.

1996 - Counter drug operations. June and July 1996 saw &quot;Peterson&quot; off the coasts of South and Central America in the Eastern Pacific Ocean for counter drug operations. During this employment, the &quot;Peterson&quot; crew enjoyed a Line-crossing ceremony in sight of the Galápagos Islands. After returning home, she began training for her next deployment.

1997 - Atlantic deployment. In July 1997 &quot;Peterson&quot; deployed with NATO as a member of the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic Squadron. She operated with ships of the British, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Canadian and other NATO navies.

1999 - Mediterranean deployment. &quot;Peterson&quot; deployed as flagship for the Standing Naval Forces Mediterranean Squadron in support of NATO. Peterson participated in the Kosovo campaign as part of this NATO battle group.

=== Operations in the Persian Gulf and boarding of the &quot;Samra&quot; ===
2001-2002 - Persian Gulf deployment. &quot;Peterson&quot; completed a deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. She was at the tip of the spear, and involved in every facet of the operation. As the Comskey guardship and Commander, Destroyer Squadron Fifty flagship for maritime interdiction operations in the North Persian Gulf. &quot;Peterson&quot; was praised as &#x27;One of the best to have operated in the Persian Gulf in a long time!&#x27;. She operated as Surface Action Group commander of the JASK operating area in the Gulf of Oman then again in the North Arabian Sea off Karachi, Pakistan. &quot;Peterson&quot; conducted 349 queries and 4 boardings - one of which resulted in crew member fatalities - in support of maritime interdiction operations. The ill-fated mission in question occurred on 18 November 2001, when 8 U.S Navy members boarded &quot;Samra,&quot; an Iraqi oil-smuggling ship, suspecting it of violating oil sanctions against then president Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. While on board, &quot;Samra&quot; sank, killing 2 of the USS Peterson&#x27;s crewmen, and 1 of &quot;Samra&#x27;s&quot; crew members. &quot;Peterson&quot; supported amphibious readiness group as Combined Task Force 51 sea component commander conducting intelligence surveillance and reporting operations off the Horn of Africa for exercise Edged Mallet in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. She received more than ten accolades from national and fleet commanders for the timely, high quality reporting provided to the Office of Naval Intelligence, greatly improving understanding of suspect activities in the Horn of Africa region. &quot;Peterson&quot; safely completed a 196-day deployment with 178 days spent underway, with over 600 queries conducted, more than 700 flight evolutions, 34 underway replenishments, 6 sea and anchor details, and more than 500 small boat operations.

=== Final Operations and decommissioning ===

Final underway: While returning from Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Peterson&quot; steamed for 6 hours at full power and successfully fired 100 rounds from her 5&quot;/54 guns. This demonstration of strength proved that she was an asset to her country until the end.

&quot;Peterson&quot; decommissioned on 4 October 2002, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 November 2002. On 16 February 2004 she was sunk in the western North Atlantic Ocean in support of weapons effect tests for the new DD-21 program, later renamed DD(X), then again renamed DDG 1000, which is the current Program of Record. The ship&#x27;s bell was transferred to Baldwin County, Alabama for display at the war memorial at the Foley satellite courthouse and was unveiled on 5 January 2012. The site of the wreck was confirmed in approximately 2,400 m (7,874 ft) of water on 7 July 2014 by the EV &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Caron&quot; (DD-970) was a , named for Hospital Corpsman Third Class Wayne M. Caron (1946–1968), who was killed in action during the Vietnam War, and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

== History ==
&quot;Caron&quot; was laid down by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi on 1 July 1974. She was commissioned on 1 October 1977.

In August 1979 Soviet planes staged a mock missile attack against the &quot;Caron&quot; in the Black Sea.

In late October, 1983 the &quot;Caron&quot; participated in Operation Urgent Fury in the vicinity of Grenada. Near H-hour on D-Day, 25 Oct. 1983, the &quot;Caron&quot; recovered a 20-man Navy SEAL/Air Force reconnaissance team from waters off the island&#x27;s southwest coast. The recon team had sortied from the &quot;USS Clifton Sprague&quot; to assess the condition of a 9,000-foot runway then under construction by Cuban workers at Point Salines. Heavy swells swamped the engines of the team&#x27;s small boats before they could reach shore. The &quot;Caron&quot; spotted them drifting offshore as dawn approached. Much later that day, the &quot;Caron&quot; recovered 10 more SEALs from the waters northwest of the island&#x27;s capital after another commando team was driven off a radio transmitter site by a Grenadian counter-attack. The next afternoon, the &quot;Caron&quot; made yet a third recovery. The destroyer took aboard 11 Army Rangers on a raft who had been left behind on Grand Anse Beach following the successful helicopter rescue of 233 medical students and staff from St. George&#x27;s University School of Medicine&#x27;s beachfront campus.

From November 1983 to March 1984 &quot;Caron&quot; was part of the Multi National Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon.

On 10 March 1986, &quot;Caron&quot; departed Norfolk, Virginia with the carrier battle group, for a Mediterranean deployment. During this deployment, the Action in the Gulf of Sidra took place during a freedom of navigation exercise in the Gulf of Sidra. This action saw U.S. Navy fighter aircraft shoot two Libyan Air Force fighters down. On 23 March 1986, operating with and , &quot;Caron&quot; moved south of the Libya–claimed &quot;Line of Death&quot;. Libya reacted with two days of low intensity conflict in which &quot;Caron&quot; did not fire any weapons.

On 12 February 1988 &quot;Caron&quot; was lightly rammed by Soviet Mirka II class light frigate (FFL 824) in the Black Sea.

On 15 February 1990 &quot;Caron&quot; completed a regular overhaul.

&quot;Caron&quot; was deployed to the Middle East after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and from 14 January 1991 she participated in Operation Desert Storm.

On 14 October 1993 she began participation in United Nations-mandated, U.S.-executed sanctions enforcement operations against Haiti. She was one of six US Navy ships prepositioned off Haiti as a result of an order by President Bill Clinton. Clinton&#x27;s order allowed the ships to be in position to enforce United Nations sanctions fully on the date at which they went into effect.

In April 1995 &quot;Caron&quot; took part in a NATO mine countermeasures exercise off Denmark.

From January to July 1996 she deployed to the Persian Gulf upholding United Nations sanctions against Iraq and aiding in Operation Southern Watch.

From February to 3 July 1998 she deployed to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf, operating with and Carrier Group Seven. During this deployment, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 46 (HSL-46) Detachment 3 maintained 2 SH-60B Seahawk onboard &quot;Caron.&quot; One of the first exercises during this deployment was Exercise Shark Hunt 98 in April 1998 off the coast of Spain.

From January to 4 June 1999 she completed a regular overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. This overhaul included modifications to accommodate female crew. In June to December 2000 she deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf, operating with the battle group.

On 15 October 2001 the ship was decommissioned.

On 4 December 2002 &quot;Caron&quot; was sunk intentionally off the coast of Puerto Rico as a result of explosive testing.

=== Incidents in Soviet waters ===

On 13 March 1986, in an unprecedented move, &quot;Caron&quot; and entered Soviet territorial waters to the south of the Crimean Peninsula, which prompted a Soviet diplomatic protest. Administration officials claimed it was &quot;simply an exercise of the right of innocent passage&quot;, although Pentagon officials readily confirmed that one purpose of the exercise was to collect intelligence.

In February 1988, &quot;Caron&quot;, again operating with , entered Soviet territorial waters limit in the Black Sea off the Crimean Peninsula. Under international law, this act could be permissible if the ship was progressing from one point in international waters to another point in international waters via the shortest course possible, but according to the Soviet Union, it was the right of the USSR to authorize or prohibit travel in selected areas within the 12-mile limit. The United States, however, did not recognize the Soviet claim in this case. To prevent the claim from becoming accepted precedent, the US Navy asserted that it had sailed warships through such areas at regular intervals in the past in accordance with established international law.

In response, the Soviets deployed a frigate &quot;Bezzavetnyy&quot; (rus.: &quot;Беззаветный&quot;, Burevestnik M-class frigate) and a SKR-6 (rus.: CКР-6) Mirka II class light frigate as well as many other Soviet Navy, Coast Guard, KGB and &quot;civilian&quot; ships to intercept the U.S. ships. Soviet aircraft continuously buzzed the &quot;Caron&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; as smaller vessels weaved to and fro in front of the American ships. Several times, Soviet vessels and aircraft obtained radar &quot;lock&quot; on the &quot;Caron&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Both American ships maintained a constant course and speed throughout the incident. Eventually, the Soviets lightly rammed both ships. After the collision, and the threat of the use of weapons and aircraft by both sides, the American ships left the territorial waters of the Soviet Union. No significant damage resulted to any of the ships involved. Yorktown was under repair for 3 months.

== Ship&#x27;s crest ==
The design of the shield and crest of the coat of arms is based on service of Wayne Maurice Caron, Hospital Corpsman Third Class, United States Navy, who heroically sacrificed his life on 28 July 1968 while aiding wounded Marines on the field of fire in Vietnam. The Medal of Honor was awarded him posthumously. &quot;Caron&quot; is named in his honor.

The light blue center section and the white five-pointed star allude to the Medal of Honor ribbon; the star is also inverted in reference to the silhouette of the Medal of Honor pendant. The one light blue and the two Navy blue sections refer to the courage, steadfast determination and selfless dedication of Petty Officer Caron in performance of duty while serving as Platoon Corpsman with Company K, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, 1st Marine Division. The sweep of his unit through an open rice field in Quảng Nam Province is indicated by the scarlet base and the embattled gold chevron. Navy blue and gold and scarlet and gold are the colors of the Navy and Marine Corps.

The Navy-blue caduceus is the insignia worn on white uniforms by Hospital Corpsmen, United States Navy. This insignia and the crossed bayonets (in the colors of the Marine Corps) allude to the medical services customarily provided to the Marine Corps by the Navy. In particular, the caduceus and bayonets symbolize the combat operation in which Petty Officer Caron, though grievously wounded, was killed while giving medical assistance to his wounded comrades.

<text>Marchlewszczyzna () was a Polish National District in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic created as an experiment and as part of the Soviet korenizatsia campaign in to the west of Zhytomyr on 21 July 1925 by resolution of the Little Presidium of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. Its capital, the town of Dovbysh, was renamed later in 1926 as Marchlewsk. The district was one of 32 other national districts that were created in the Ukrainian SSR during that period (1924-1939). Creation of the district was based on standards adopted by the fourth session of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee (15-19 February 1925) and recommendations of the Central Commission in affairs of National Minorities at that executive committee. It was created to implement an idea in creation of Polish national districts on territories of Ukrainian and Belarusian SSRs.

==History==
The district was located far away from the railroad in an area numerically dominated by settlements of khutor type (farmsteads). The village of Dovbysh was a small settlement around the . The district did not have telephone and telegraph communications and by general estimates it was economically backwards. Initially the district was composed of 26 rural communities (&quot;selsoviets&quot;) with a general area of 620 km2. Later 108 populated places were united into 34 communities (30 Polish, 2 Ukrainian, 2 German). In percentage terms the population consisted of 68.8% Polish people, 19.2% Ukrainians, 8.8% Germans, 2.5% Jews and 0.5% of Russians. In 1932 the number of communities increased to 38, 34 of which were Polish.

The official opening ceremony of the district took place on 27 March 1926 with the participation of Felix Dzerzhinsky, Feliks Kon, Samuil Lazovert, Boleslav Skarbek and Józef Unszlicht at the First district congress of Soviets (27–30 April 1926) where in total 103 delegates and 500 visitors took part. The newly created district received valuable presents: from the Moscow Factory &quot;Tribuna&quot; were 2 tractors with ploughs, from the &quot;Pratsia&quot; association radio receivers, from the Polish department of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Enlightenment of the Ukrainian SSR otoscopes. In 1927 took place the Second congress of Soviets of Marchlewski District at which were present Tomasz Dąbal, Samuil Lazovert and Boleslav Skarbek. During the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution the Polish District was visited by a Polish delegation.

As a type of Soviet propaganda, the subdivision was located just from the eastern border of the Second Polish Republic and was named after the Polish Bolshevik Julian Marchlewski, who was a rector of the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West and dreamed of Poland becoming part of the Soviet Union. Marchlewszczyzna had to become an exemplary autonomous district where Bolsheviks sought to demonstrate to their western neighbor Poland that the Polish as a nation will also submit to &quot;government of workers and peasants&quot;. The function of the Polish District had boldly expressed its political composition, as the leader of the Polish section of the Central Commission in affairs of National Minorities Jan Saulewicz had spoken about more than once.

The raion was established out of the already existing Pulyny Raion. Later in 1930 the rest of the Pulyny Raion was transformed into a German National District. Soon after the establishment of the Marchlewski Polish National District, territorial division by governorates in the Ukrainian SSR was abolished and Marchlewszczyzna became part at first of Zhytomyr Okruha and after the establishing of Kyiv Oblast in 1932, part of Novohrad Volynskyi Okruha.

In the initial years of the district&#x27;s existence, local Poles enjoyed limited autonomy, with 55 Polish-language schools, 80 reading rooms and a Polish daily &quot;Marchlewszczyzna Radziecka&quot; (&quot;Soviet Marchlewszczyzna&quot;). At the same time, its inhabitants were subject to intense communist propaganda. Polish grammar rules, regarded as &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, were changed; however, the district lacked educated people. The majority of its inhabitants were Catholic peasants who were not interested in communist ideas. Therefore, such persons as Tomasz Dąbal were brought there to propagate atheism. An organization named the Polish Anti-Catholic Section was also founded.

As one of the Dovbysh residents recalled, after local elections some newly elected officials were soon arrested and taken away in &quot;Chornyi voronok&quot; (an NKVD car, which, in particular was used to carry detainees). Among such was Jan Trybel, the father of Halyna (Helena) Trybel, who spent 20 years in exile. Halyna Trybel happened to be a mother of Yuriy Yekhanurov.

The Soviet authorities, who wanted to create Polish laborers, future citizens of the Polish Soviet Republic, built several factories as well as power plants and telephone lines. This also brought about improvement in the quality of life, but all efforts were destroyed in the early 1930s, when the collectivization in the Soviet Union began. Polish peasants opposed it fiercely, and thousands of them perished in the Holodomor.

Initially, ethnic Poles constituted around 70% of district&#x27;s population, which in 1926 totalled around 41,000. Other inhabitants were Ukrainians (20%), Germans (7%) and Jews. In 1930, after several adjacent villages were added to Marchlewszczyzna, the population grew to 52,000, with Poles still constituting 70%. It has been estimated that the district consisted of around 100 villages, settlements and smaller towns.

In 1935 by resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (signed by Grigoriy Petrovskiy) the Polish national raion was abolished and split between the newly formed Chervonoarmiyskyi Raion and Baranivka Raion, Kyiv Oblast, while some communities were also transferred to either Novohrad-Volynskyi or Zhytomyr municipalities. In Zhytomyr Oblast the former Marchlewszczyzna appeared upon creation of the oblast in 1938.

Soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, since 1996 in the local town school the Polish language is being taught once again by the efforts of the local Polish Society of Jan Paul II. Already in 1990 in Dovbysh the local Catholic parish was revived.

<text>USS &quot;David R. Ray&quot; (DD-971), was a &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer named for United States Navy Hospital Corpsman Second Class David Robert Ray who was killed in action in 1969 while assigned to a Marine Corps artillery unit during the Vietnam War and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

The &quot;David R. Ray&quot; was built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and commissioned on November 19, 1977, in Pascagoula. The principal speaker at the event was James R. Sasser, U.S. Senator from Tennessee and the ships sponsor was Mrs. Donnie M. Ray, HM2 Ray&#x27;s mother. The &quot;David R. Ray&quot; was decommissioned in 2002 and sunk as a target in 2008.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
On the voyage from Pascagoula to her new homeport of San Diego, the &quot;David R. Ray&quot; passed through the Panama Canal. &quot;David R. Ray&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Sting Ray&quot;, crossed the equator for the first time on 16 May 1978. On 19 February 1979, she became the first ship to intercept a supersonic drone with the NATO RIM-7 Seasparrow Missile System. The ship first deployed on 8 September 1979 and made port calls in Pearl Harbor, Guam, Yokosuka, Inchon, Subic Bay, and Hong Kong. In 1982, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; went through her first major overhaul in Seattle, Washington. On 18 October 1983, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; began another &quot;WESTPAC&quot; to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. After port visits to Pearl Harbor, Subic Bay, Pusan, Chinhae, Hong Kong and Pattaya, the ship participated in a joint Thailand-U.S. naval exercise. Later, the &quot;Ray&quot; spent 54 continuous days underway, spanning from the northwest Indian Ocean to northernmost Sea of Japan following and performing surveillance operations (SURVOPS) on the newest Soviet carrier, &quot;Novorossiysk&quot;.
Late in 1984, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; became the Navy&#x27;s primary test platform for the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) System. On 15 January 1986, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; deployed with Battle Group Foxtrot. During this deployment, the ship made worldwide news when it prevented the boarding of the U.S. Vessel President McKinley by an Iranian Saam class frigate on 12 May 1986.

&quot;David R. Ray&quot;&#x27;s second major overhaul began in June 1988, which coincided with the ship&#x27;s shift of homeport from San Diego to Long Beach, California. During this overhaul, the ship received a Vertical Launch System. After the overhaul, the ship completed four CNO projects, including RAM, NATO Seasparrow RIM-7P, BGM-109 Tomahawk Block 2 and ASROC. &quot;David R. Ray&quot; deployed on 27 April 1990 and was in the Persian Gulf at the onset of Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. The ship played a critical role in the early stages of Operation Desert Shield before returning to the United States. Deploying again to the Middle East Force on 22 April 1992, the ship served as flagship during Maritime Interception Force Operations before returning to Long Beach, California, on 22 October 1992.
&quot;David R. Ray&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf in October 1994 and served as flagship to Commander, Destroyer Squadron Fifty conducting Maritime Interception Operations in boarding numerous suspect vessels resulting in the diversion and detention of three vessels. Upon return from deployment in April 1995, the ship continued a very fast operational tempo, including trips to Catalina Island, Seattle Sea Fair, and San Francisco Fleet Week.

&quot;David R. Ray&quot; completed a nine-month regular overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard in June 1996 and then a homeport change to Everett, Washington, in July 1996. The ship completed a full workup cycle before deploying on 20 May 1997 to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf as senior ship of a Middle East Force / Surface Action Group. During this deployment, the ship conducted 49 boardings and over 700 flight hours in support of Maritime Interception Operations. Upon return in November 1997, the ship went into holiday stand down and commenced a nine-week maintenance availability on 11 February 1998 which ended 15 April 1998. &quot;David R. Ray&quot; spent the remainder of 1998 preparing for its next deployment. On 9 March 1999, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; received no notice tasking to act as the Surface Action Group Commander for the sinking of the M/V &quot;New Carissa&quot; off the coast of Oregon. The ship&#x27;s quick response and control of the elements of the Surface Action Group averted a potentially disastrous oil spill. The ship and her crew earned the Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational Device for its participation in this effort.

On 16 April 1999 the &quot;David R. Ray&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf on PACMEF 99-2 as the Surface Action Group Commander. The ship and crew conducted 55 boardings and over 850 hours of flight operations. &quot;David R. Ray&quot; was again in the news when her crew helped to delivery a healthy baby girl on aboard an Iraqi ferry. The ship returned to its homeport on 4 October 1999. Since returning from deployment, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; participated in various training opportunities, including Anti-Air Warfare and Naval Surface Fire Support exercises. Prior to the ship&#x27;s change of command on 29 April 2000, &quot;David R. Ray&quot; visited Puerto Vallarta and escorted the ex-USS &quot;South Carolina&quot; (CGN-37) as she was towed to Bremerton, Washington, for deactivation and nuclear-powered vessel recycling.

In May 2001 the &quot;David R. Ray&quot; deployed on her final assignment to the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific on a Counter Narcotic Deployment, returning to its home port in October 2001.

On 28 February 2002, USS &quot;David R. Ray&quot; was decommissioned and spent its remaining years anchored in Sinclair Inlet off Highway 303 in Bremerton, Washington. On 17 June 2008, the ex-USS &quot;David R. Ray&quot; was towed by fleet tug to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was to be sunk as a target as part of the annual RIMPAC exercises. ex-&quot;David R. Ray&quot; was sunk during RIMPAC 2008 on 11 July 2008 by fire from eight U.S. and Japanese ships along with three aircraft using naval artillery and Harpoon missiles. ex-&quot;David R. Ray&quot; sank after sunset that night.

== In popular culture ==

The destroyer is a secondary setting for the 45th installment of the Bande dessinée series Buck Danny, &quot;Les secrets de la Mer Noire&quot;, set during the early 1990s, where the hero&#x27;s sidekicks Jerry Tumbler and Sonny Tuckson are on board on a mission of distant support for Buck Danny, himself on a PR mission on the soviet carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;.

== Ship&#x27;s crest ==
The coat of arms of &quot;David R. Ray&quot; serves as a heraldic reminder of the ship&#x27;s namesake. The light blue center section and white inverted star allude to the Medal of Honor pendant. The light blue and two Navy blue stripes represent the courage, perseverance and selfless devotion of Petty Officer Ray in the performance of his duties as corpsman with Battery D, Second Battalion, Eleventh Marine Regiment, First Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in South Vietnam. The battery&#x27;s position is indicated by the scarlet and gold embattled border.

Navy blue, gold and scarlet are the colors of the Navy and Marine Corps. The navy blue caduceus is the insignia worn by hospital corpsmen in the U.S. Navy. The artillery howitzer cartridges allude to the medical services the Navy provides to Marine Corps artillery units, in particular, the action in which Petty Officer Ray, though fatally wounded, gave medical assistance and protection to wounded Marine comrades. The ship&#x27;s motto, &quot;Determined, Ready, Resourceful&quot; alludes to the initials of Petty Officer Ray and epitomizes his legacy to the ship that bears his name. The motto served as a guide and inspiration for the men and women who served on the &quot;David R. Ray&quot; throughout the years.

<text>Michael Dean Bossy (January 22, 1957April 15, 2022) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player with the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League. He spent his entire NHL career, which lasted from 1977 to 1987, with the Islanders, and was a crucial part of their four consecutive Stanley Cup championships in the early 1980s.

Bossy won the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1978 as NHL rookie of the year when he set the then-record for most goals by a rookie with 53. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy in the 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs as the most valuable player and the Lady Byng Trophy for combining high quality play with sportsmanship three times. He led the NHL in goals twice and was second three further times. Bossy was voted to the league&#x27;s first all-star team as right wing five times, with three further selections to the second all-star team. He is one of two players (Jack Darragh being the other) to score consecutive Stanley Cup-winning goals (1982 and 1983) and the only player to record four game-winning goals in one playoff series (1983 Conference Final).

Bossy is the NHL&#x27;s all-time leader in average goals scored per regular season game, holds the NHL&#x27;s third-highest all-time average points scored per regular season game, and is the second of five players to score 50 goals in 50 games, being the first to accomplish this feat 36 years after Maurice Richard did so. He tied for the record for most 50-goal seasons with Wayne Gretzky and Alexander Ovechkin with nine, though his were consecutive as opposed to Gretzky&#x27;s and Ovechkin&#x27;s being non-consecutive; he thus is the sole record-holder for most consecutive 50-goal seasons.

Bossy was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

==Early life==
Bossy was the fifth son among ten children, and grew up in a family of Detroit Red Wings fans in the parish of Saint-Alphonse, in the Ahuntsic-Cartierville area of Montreal. Bossy attended St. Pius X Comprehensive High School and then Laval Catholic High School. His mother Dorothy was English and French-Canadian, and his father Borden, who maintained a backyard ice rink at their apartment building, was Ukrainian. When he was 12 years old, Bossy broke a kneecap while competing in long jump at school, later developing chronic knee problems during his hockey career.

As a youth, Bossy played in the 1969 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Montreal. He started his junior career with the Laval National of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League at the age of 15. Despite scoring 309 goals in five seasons, he was considered &quot;not rugged enough&quot; and defensively weak by NHL scouts. His total of 532 points remains a QMJHL record, and his 309 goals is the record for all of major junior. Bossy&#x27;s #17 is retired by the Acadie–Bathurst Titan, the current incarnation of the former Laval franchise.

==Playing career==
===Early stardom===
Bossy, who had averaged 77 goals per season in junior with Laval, was passed over by twelve teams in the 1977 NHL amateur draft, including the New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs, who each passed over him twice. Toronto expected him to hold out for more than they wanted to pay, according to Bossy, while the Rangers opted for highly-ranked Lucien DeBlois and Ron Duguay. Other teams passed for various reasons: the Buffalo Sabres took Ric Seiling, preferring his checking ability, while the Cleveland Barons, who had the fifth overall pick, passed when Bossy&#x27;s agent Pierre Lacroix gave the Barons inflated salary requirements, prompting them to select Mike Crombeen instead. Scotty Bowman, coach of the Montreal Canadiens, later regretted that Montreal had passed on Bossy; Bowman and his assistant Claude Ruel had each been impressed with Bossy&#x27;s play – and scoring – in person, but team scouts questioned his toughness and the Canadiens took Mark Napier with their first pick instead.

The New York Islanders picked Bossy with the 15th overall selection. General manager Bill Torrey was torn at first between taking Bossy and Dwight Foster. Bossy was known as a scorer who could not check, while Foster, who had led the Ontario Hockey Association with 143 points, had a defensive aspect to his game. Various stories exist explaining who persuaded Torrey to select Bossy. One common story credits coach Al Arbour, who figured it would be easier to teach a scorer how to check. Another credits Islanders scout Harry Saraceno, while another credits both Arbour and Saraceno.
Bossy replaced Billy Harris on the Islanders&#x27; top line with Bryan Trottier and Clark Gillies, creating a new combination that came to be known as The Trio Grande. He scored against Don Edwards of the Buffalo Sabres in his first career game, a 3–2 loss to Buffalo on October 13, 1977, and by mid-November already had 11 goals. On February 4, 1978, Bossy collected his first career hat trick in a 6–1 win against the Washington Capitals. On February 25, Bossy scored his 45th goal of the season, to pass the previous rookie record of 44 held by Rick Martin. Bossy had boldly told Bill Torrey before the season he would score 50 goals, and wound up with a total of 53, setting a rookie record which stood until broken by Teemu Selanne in 1993. Bossy additionally led the league with 25 powerplay goals. He won the 1977–78 Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, and was named a Second Team All-Star, and additionally was named the starting right wing for the Campbell Conference in the 1978 NHL All-Star Game.

Bossy managed two goals and two assists against Toronto in the quarterfinals of the 1978 Playoffs, a hard-fought series in which the Trio Grande was somewhat neutralized by Toronto&#x27;s toughness. In game 6, with the Maple Leafs trailing in the series 3 games to 2, Bossy was hit from behind by Toronto&#x27;s Jerry Butler and sent to the hospital with a neck sprain; the Leafs won and forced a seventh game. Bossy returned for game 7 but was held scoreless as Toronto won the game – and the series – in overtime.

In the 1978–79 NHL season, Bossy was again named a Second Team All-Star after leading the league with 69 goals, at the time the second-highest single season total. On December 23, 1978, the members of the Trio Grande combined for 17 points in a 9–4 victory over the Rangers, including a hat trick and three assists for Bossy; Gillies collected four assists, while Trottier scored five times and picked up three assists. On February 19, 1979, Bossy recorded his 100th goal in his 129th game, becoming the fastest to reach that milestone, and his two-year total of 122 goals was the most by any NHL player over his first two seasons. During the season Bossy represented the NHL All-Stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup against the Soviet Union, scoring against Vladislav Tretiak in the first game of the three-game series. Bossy set an Islanders playoffs record for single-game points with four in a 1979 quarterfinal game against the Chicago Black Hawks. The Islanders swept Chicago in four games and Bossy set another team playoffs mark by collecting five goals over the series, including the overtime winner in game 2. In the semifinals, the Islanders were upset by the Rangers in six games, who targeted the Trio Grande with &quot;honest checking&quot;, and kept Bossy from scoring until the final game.

===Dynasty years===
Going into the 1979–80 season, Bossy signed a new two-year contract with the Islanders worth $500,000. After finishing in first place the season before, the Islanders got off to their worst start in six years, and in early December were out of a playoff spot, and had a losing record as late as January 9; the Islanders won only 6 of their first 21 games. Coach Al Arbour split up the Trio Grande by shifting Gillies, but while Bossy and Trottier still scored the bulk of the team&#x27;s goals the remaining lines were ineffectual. Bossy and Trottier scored the only Islander goals in a 5–2 season-opening loss to the Philadelphia Flyers, and Bossy had both goals in their second game, another 5–2 loss, this time to Buffalo. Down 3–0 to Chicago on October 27, Arbour reunited the linemates with explosive results – Trottier recorded a hat trick, and he, Gillies and Bossy all scored in a 49-second span (an Islanders team record) in a 6–4 Islanders victory. Still, the Islanders were giving up goals faster than they could score them – in November, a run of five games in which they had yielded a cumulative 26 goals culminated in a 6–3 loss to the St. Louis Blues in which Bossy, Gillies and Trottier were the only Islanders to put the puck in the net. It took until their 41st game for the Islanders to get over .500, and after acquiring Butch Goring on March 10, the Islanders went unbeaten for the rest of the season, and finished second in the Patrick Division. The acquisition of Goring made splitting up the Trio Grande more workable, as Gillies went with him, while Bossy and Trottier were joined on the second line by Bob Bourne, and the Islanders attack became more balanced. At the same time, Bossy&#x27;s goal output fell to 51, leading him to joke it was a &quot;bad season&quot;. Bossy played in the all-star game for the Campbell Conference.

In the 1979–80 Stanley Cup playoffs, Bossy scored one goal in two games in the opening round victory against the Los Angeles Kings. He missed the first three games of the quarterfinals against the Boston Bruins with a hand injury but scored twice when he returned in game 4. In the semifinals against the Sabres, Bossy collected three goals and three assists, as the Islanders advanced to the final round. In the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals, with the Islanders up three games to two against the Philadelphia Flyers, Bossy scored a power play goal in the second period of game 6, giving New York a 3–2 lead at the time. After the Flyers tied the game at 4 in the third period, the Islanders won the game – and the Cup – on an overtime goal by Bobby Nystrom. Bossy led all scorers in the Finals with 11 points, and finished second to teammate Trottier in scoring with 23 points as the Islanders won their first Stanley Cup.

In the 1980–81 season, Bossy and Charlie Simmer of the Kings contended to be the first to score 50 goals in 50 games since Maurice Richard 36 years earlier. On January 24, both Bossy and Simmer played their 50th games; Simmer recorded a hat trick in the afternoon to fall just shy at 49. That evening, Bossy scored twice against the Quebec Nordiques in the final five minutes, including the second goal with 89 seconds left, becoming the second to achieve 50 in 50. Richard sent a congratulatory telegram to Bossy. Bossy&#x27;s season included an NHL-record 9 hat tricks, and he finished the season with 68 goals, and through his first four seasons had the highest goals per game average in NHL history with .785. Bossy was again named a starter for the 1981 All-Star Game, and was named a First Team All-Star at the end of the season.

In the opening round of the 1981 Playoffs, Bossy and Trottier tied for the team lead with 10 points each, as the Islanders swept the Maple Leafs. The Islanders then defeated the Edmonton Oilers in six games, in which Bossy led all scorers with 11 points, and his 21 total points tied him with Edmonton&#x27;s Wayne Gretzky for the playoff lead. In the semifinals against the Rangers, Bossy scored two power play goals in the final game of a four-game sweep, and finished the series with five goals total. The Islanders then defeated the Minnesota North Stars in the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals, as Bossy set records for most points (35), and power-play goals (9) and most goals combining regular season and playoffs (85; 68 regular season plus 17 playoff), and the Islanders won their second Stanley Cup.

Going into the 1981–82 NHL season, Bossy signed a new six-year contract with the Islanders. That season Bossy set records for right-wingers with 83 assists and 147 points, and was +69 on the season. Bossy scored twice in the 1982 NHL All-Star Game, his fourth appearance, to lead the Wales Conference to a 4–2 victory, and was named the game&#x27;s MVP. A late-season knee injury limited Bossy&#x27;s mobility in the Islanders&#x27; Patrick Division semifinal against the Pittsburgh Penguins, although he still managed to score goals in the first two games. In the Patrick Division final, the Islanders next faced the Rangers, against whom Bossy had scored six goals with nine assists in eight regular season games. Bossy&#x27;s knee still bothered him, but he scored four goals through the first four games of the series; he also recorded four assists in the series as the Islanders won in six games. In the Wales Conference Final against the Nordiques, Bossy scored twice in game 2, including the game-winner, and twice more in game 3, again totaling eight points in the series as the Islanders swept. Going into the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals against the Vancouver Canucks, Vancouver&#x27;s Tiger Williams, whose intimidation tactics against Bossy dated back to the 1978 playoffs with Toronto, told reporters that the Canucks planned to check Bossy hard. In the opening game, Bossy recorded a hat trick, including tying the game with under five minutes left, and then intercepted a Harold Snepsts clearing attempt to score the winner in overtime. Bossy scored again in game 2 on the power play, as the Islanders took a 6–4 lead. In game 3, an acrobatic backhand goal resulting from a hit by either Williams or Lars Lindgren was the second in a 3–0 Islanders win. Two powerplay goals by Bossy in game 4 included the winner, as New York swept the series for their third Stanley Cup win. In spite of lingering knee issues, Bossy recorded 27 points and a league-leading 17 playoff goals. Bossy scored seven times in the Finals, tying him with Jean Beliveau for most goals in the final round, and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP.

Bossy became the first to score at least 60 goals in three consecutive seasons in 1982–83, and collected 118 points. At the end of the season, Bossy won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for &quot;gentlemanly&quot; play, for a season in which he received only 17 penalty minutes; he was also named a First Team All-Star for the third time. Bossy skated the 1983 NHL Playoffs on the Islanders top line, with Trottier and Anders Kallur; collectively they accounted for 17 Islander goals. In the Patrick Division semifinal against the Washington Capitals, Bossy scored a hat trick in game 4, as the Islanders won the series with a 6–3 victory. In the Wales Conference Final against the Boston Bruins, Bossy scored nine times, including an NHL-record four game-winning goals, as the Islanders advanced to the Finals for the fourth straight year. The nine goals themselves tied a then-modern era record for most in a playoff series, and included the 27th powerplay goal of his playoffs career, which broke another Jean Beliveau record. The Islanders went on to win their fourth straight Stanley Cup by sweeping the Oilers in the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals. On May 17, Bossy scored the winning goal in game 4, becoming the second player to score Stanley Cup-winning goals in consecutive years, joining Jack Darragh in 1920 and 1921.

===Later career===
As the 1983–84 NHL season got underway, Bossy had five goals in the first three games of the season, before missing six games with a hip injury. Bossy put together a 15-game point streak that ended in early December. He promptly put together a 19-game streak that lasted until mid-January. On January 15, Bossy scored his 400th career regular season goal, the fastest to hit that milestone, doing so in his 506th game, a 4–2 win against the Rangers. Bossy was named to appear in the 1984 NHL All-Star Game, which would have been his sixth consecutive All-Star game, but a collision with Detroit&#x27;s Dwight Foster resulted in a knee injury and Rick Middleton took his place in the starting lineup; Bossy wound up missing six games with this injury. At the end of the season, Bossy had 51 goals, for his seventh consecutive season with at least 50. Bossy was named a First Team All-Star for the fourth straight year, and again won the Lady Byng Trophy; the Lady Byng Trophy was presented to Bossy at the NHL Awards by Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau.

In the 1984 Stanley Cup playoffs, Bossy scored four times combined in the opening rounds against the Capitals and Rangers, but then equaled that total against the Canadiens, including three game-winners, as the Islanders won their record 19th straight playoff series and advanced to their fifth straight Stanley Cup Finals. Bossy missed game 1 of the 1984 Stanley Cup Finals, a rematch against the Oilers, with tonsillitis. When he returned, Bossy, who had scored 17 goals in each of the previous three post-seasons, failed to score, and was held without a shot on goal in two of the games, as the Oilers won their first Stanley Cup.

Bossy started the 1984–85 NHL season strong, tying his own team record by scoring in ten consecutive games, and by early November was leading the league with 33 points. By early December, he was scoring at better than a goal per game, with 25 markers in 23 contests. With Trottier missing time with injuries, the team&#x27;s top line during the first five weeks of the season consisted of Bossy, Brent Sutter and John Tonelli, with that combination providing more than half of the team&#x27;s offense. After Trottier returned, he took his usual place alongside Bossy, joined with Greg Gilbert, but the Bossy-Tonelli-Sutter combination was resurrected later in the season when the team needed a boost. After 41 games, Bossy was having his best season so far, with 37 goals and 39 assists in that span, as he continued to carry the team. He was selected for the 1985 NHL All-Star Game, his seventh selection overall and the only unanimous choice that year. Bossy finished the season with 58 goals, his eighth consecutive season of 50-goals plus, and earned Second Team All-Star honours, as the Islanders stumbled into the playoffs. In the opening round of the 1985 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Islanders narrowly got past Washington in the opening round, with Bossy assisting on Brent Sutter&#x27;s game-winning goal. In the second round, the Philadelphia Flyers held Bossy scoreless through the first three games, taking a 3–0 series lead; when Bossy scored in a 6–2 Islanders game 4 victory, it tied Maurice Richard&#x27;s record for career playoff goals with 82. The Islanders were eliminated in game 5, a 1–0 shutout, as Bossy was held to two shots on goal.

After starting the 1985–86 NHL season with Trottier again, Bossy found himself on continually changing lines throughout the course of the season. By mid-October he had been teamed with Pat LaFontaine and rookie Ari Haanpaa. Al Arbour frequently juggled the lines to spark his team with varying results; reuniting Bossy with Tonelli and Brent Sutter coincided with a Bossy hat trick in a 4–4 tie with Minnesota in November, while Bossy scored the winner in a 7–4 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins after being teamed with Trottier and Mikko Mäkelä. Bossy and Trottier were playing alongside Tonelli in February, connecting on the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Vancouver, but this tandem was itself split up when Tonelli was traded to the Calgary Flames in March for Steve Konroyd and Richard Kromm. The Islanders and Flames faced each other on the same day as the trade, and Bossy scored four goals, while on a line with Kromm and Trottier.

Bossy hit a number of milestones during the course of the season. On January 2, 1986, Bossy became the fastest player to reach 500 goals in NHL history, scoring twice in his 647th game, a 7–5 victory against the Boston Bruins. On January 24, Bossy collected his 1,000th regular season point by assisting on a Trottier goal in a 7–5 win against Washington; a goal in the same game moved Bossy into 10th place at the time on the all-time scoring list. Bossy&#x27;s four-goal game against Calgary on March 11 included his 50th of the year, making this the record-setting ninth straight season in which he had scored at least 50 goals. Bossy scored his 61st goal in the last game of the season against the New Jersey Devils, completing his record fifth season with at least 60 goals.

In the 1986 NHL All-Star Game, Bossy assisted on Bryan Trottier&#x27;s overtime game-winning goal in a 4–3 Wales Conference victory. The Islanders did not make it past the opening round of the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs as they were swept in three games by Washington, but Bossy did set a new all-time record by scoring his 83rd playoff goal. Bossy was named a First Team All-Star and won the Lady Byng Trophy for the third time.

At the beginning of training camp Bossy experienced back pain, and after playing two uncomfortable games in which he did not score, he was ordered to rest for 10 days. The hiatus spanned four games, after which Bossy returned strong, scoring 12 times across 12 games, in addition to recording 9 assists. By Christmas, Bossy had 22 goals but was playing through pain and was not at his usual level, and was undergoing chiropractic treatments and considering taking time off in February. On January 6, playing on a line with Gilbert and Trottier against Minnesota, Bossy scored twice and was still on pace for another 50-goal season. Bossy then missed seven consecutive games in January as the back pain flared up, and doctors were at a loss to determine a diagnosis. It was believed that he was putting undue strain on his back by skating in a manner to take pressure off his right knee, which had required surgery when he was a child; Bossy had broken the kneecap when he was twelve. Bossy was voted to be the starting right wing representing the NHL against the Soviet Union in Rendez-vous &#x27;87, the 1987 replacement for the NHL All-Star Game, but ultimately pulled out of the series due to his back problems. Bossy still hoped to record a tenth consecutive 50-goal season, with it still possible as of early February, and had reached 32 by the end of the month. However, by late March it was apparent to Bossy that he would not be reaching the milestone, as the pain increased, and he additionally found himself the target of hits that exploited his condition. In a March 14 game against New Jersey, Bossy scored his 38th goal of the season, which proved to be his last, as he finished the season tied with Pat LaFontaine for the team lead. After sitting out the final seven games of the season to rest his back for the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs, Bossy returned for the opening game of the Patrick Division semifinal against Washington, and scored a powerplay goal. He then suffered an injury to his left knee on a hit from Lou Franceschetti in game 2, and missed the rest of the series, in which the Islanders came back from a three-games-to-one deficit and won the deciding seventh game in quadruple overtime. Bossy returned to the ice in the fourth game of the Patrick Division final against Philadelphia, scoring his 85th career playoffs goal in game 6 as the Islanders again were coming back from a three-to-one deficit, but the Islanders were eliminated with a 5–1 loss in game 7.

Bossy intended to attend training camp in 1987, but with his condition remaining stagnant, and pain preventing him from bending to tie his own skates, Bossy instead underwent a series of tests and x-rays on his back. Doctors eventually concluded that he had two discs in his lower back that were damaged and could not be repaired by surgery, leading Bossy to sit out the 1987–88 season in favour of therapy. During his season off, Bill Torrey had offered to trade Bossy to the Canadiens, so he could be closer to home, but Bossy declined. The Los Angeles Kings acquired Wayne Gretzky in the summer of 1988, and owner Bruce McNall and general manager Rogie Vachon each invited Bossy to sign with the team as a free agent; Bossy declined this offer as well, believing he would not have been able to meet expectations. Bossy officially retired in October 1988, having played his last game at the young age of 30; he scored 573 goals and 553 assists in 752 NHL games, all with the Islanders.

The Islanders retired Bossy&#x27;s uniform number, No. 22, on March 3, 1992. Bossy was the second Islander afforded that honour after longtime teammate Denis Potvin.

===Legacy===
At the end of his shortened playing career, Bossy had impressive numbers. He scored 573 goals and had 553 assists in only 752 games. In 129 playoff games, he had eighty-five goals and seventy-five assists. When he retired, he held the record for most goals per season average with 57.3. While he wanted to be considered a great overall player, he was best known for his impressive scoring output. In Stan Fischler&#x27;s &quot;The All-New Hockey&#x27;s 100&quot;, Bossy says, &quot;About 90 percent of the time I don&#x27;t aim: I just try to get my shot away as quick as possible as a surprise element. I just try to get the puck on net.&quot; Bossy was also noted for his clean play and won the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986. He spoke out against hockey violence.

Bossy aspired to be the best player of his era but fell short, as the Hart Memorial Trophy and Art Ross Trophy were two of the awards that eluded Bossy during his career, going to Guy Lafleur, Trottier, and Wayne Gretzky. Bossy is frequently compared to Lafleur as they were both considered among the best right-wing snipers, although their styles contrasted as Lafleur was a stylish skater while Bossy was the more accurate shooter.

Although the Islanders swept the Edmonton Oilers in the 1983 final to win a fourth consecutive championship, Gretzky and his Oilers still received the most attention. Bossy harboured some animosity towards Gretzky and the Oilers, stating that the Islanders got little recognition for their dynasty compared to them or the Montreal Canadiens. Bossy complained &quot;I do a lot of promoting for how good [the Islanders] were ... We never got one millionth of the recognition we should. We had a very low-key organization. They didn&#x27;t want guys doing too much, because they thought the hockey might suffer. People don&#x27;t talk about us in the first mention of great teams.&quot;

==Post-playing career==
After his playing days were over, Bossy was unable to play hockey or even work out because of his back and knees. Bossy returned to Laval with his family. He went into business with Pierre Lacroix, his agent, and joined Titan, a hockey stick manufacturer, as vice-president. He was also a broadcaster for the Quebec Nordiques. By 1992, in addition to golfing and public speaking, he represented Karhu, Titan&#x27;s former parent company, and CUMIS, an insurance agency, in public relations positions.

In 1993, Bossy broke into radio, and by 1994, he was part of the &quot;Y&#x27;e trop d&#x27;bonne heure&quot; (It&#x27;s too early) morning show on CKOI-FM, a French-language radio station in Montreal. Originally brought on to read the sports, Bossy became known for comic leanings, until he left in 1996. By 1999, Bossy was doing public relations for Humpty Dumpty, and became the Quebec sales director of the company in 2003. He also joined Bobby Orr and Cassie Campbell as ambassadors for Hockey Canada&#x27;s Chevrolet Safe &amp; Fun Hockey program.

He afterwards recalled not being able to get a job with an NHL organization for over a decade and a half. &quot;I called the Canadiens at least two or three times [in the mid-1990s] because I thought I could help the organization in some way, not necessarily as a coach but in some role that could be developed&quot;, Bossy told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 2005. &quot;They never called back.&quot; When former linemate Bryan Trottier was hired as New York Rangers coach in 2002, Bossy was certain Trottier would hire him on in some capacity. &quot;The reason was,&quot; Bossy said, &quot;I remember having umpteen conversations with Bryan, having roomed with him for 10 years, that went, &#x27;One of these days, Mike, we&#x27;re going to take a team and do it our way.&#x27; I&#x27;ve found out since from Bryan [who was fired in his first season] that he wasn&#x27;t going to be given that chance.&quot;

On October 13, 2006, the Islanders announced that Bossy had rejoined the organization, working with the front office in sponsor and fan development.

In September 2014, Bossy joined MSG Networks as a hockey analyst, and in September 2015, he officially joined TVA Sports, an official French-language broadcaster of the NHL in Canada, as a colour commentator. Bossy appeared on the late night show &quot;Dave Morissette Live&quot; and &quot;TVA Sports at 5&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In 1982, Game Plan, Inc. produced a prototype pinball machine named, &quot;Mike Bossy the Scoring Machine&quot;. Only one unit was made by the company.

At the 1985 All-Star Game, Bossy and other NHL all-stars took part in filming scenes for the music video for &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, a Canadian charity single produced by David Foster, who wanted hockey players to participate as being emblematic of Canada. Bossy said of the experience that his &quot;fantasy is to be a singer&quot;.

In 2005, Bossy played himself in &quot;Les Boys 4&quot;, a sequel in the popular French Canadian &quot;Les Boys&quot; series. Bossy served as a consultant for &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot;, a hockey-themed special episode of the animated TV series &quot;The Raccoons&quot;. For most of the episode, the character Cedric Sneer is seen wearing a New York Islanders jersey with the number 22, as an homage to Bossy.

==Accomplishments==
Bossy holds several Islanders team records, including as the all-time regular season goals leader with 573. He is also the team leader in career playoff goals with 85, and holds the team single-season record for playoff goals, which he achieved in three straight playoffs starting with 1980–81.

, Bossy holds or shares the following NHL records:
* Most consecutive 50+ goal seasons: 9
* Most 50+ goal seasons (not necessarily consecutive): 9 (tied with Wayne Gretzky and Alexander Ovechkin)
* Most 60+ goal seasons (not necessarily consecutive): 5 (tied with Wayne Gretzky)
* Highest goals-per-game average, career (minimum 200 total goals): .762 goals per game
* Most power-play goals, one playoff season: 9 (tied with Cam Neely)
* Most consecutive hat tricks: 3 (tied with Joe Malone, who accomplished this twice)
* In January 2017, Bossy was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

Bossy also led the league in goals twice, in 1978–79 and 1980–81 (both predate the Rocket Richard Trophy).

Bossy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991. His No. 22 sweater was retired by the Islanders on March 3, 1992. In 1997, he was ranked number 20 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

==Personal life and death==
Bossy met his future wife Lucie Creamer when he was 14, and she was working the snack bar at a rink where he was playing; they were married July 23, 1977. Bossy and his wife had two daughters, Josiane and Tanya, and two grandchildren.

On October 19, 2021, Bossy announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He died in Rosemère on April 15, 2022, at the age of 65. A week after Bossy&#x27;s death, Guy Lafleur also succumbed to lung cancer (he and Bossy smoked heavily during their playing days); both Bossy and Lafleur were Quebec natives whose contemporary careers as star right-wingers were often compared.

<text>Kathleen Mary Griffin (born November 4, 1960) is an American comedian and actress who has starred in television series, comedy specials and has released multiple comedy albums. In 2007 and 2008, Griffin won Primetime Emmy Awards for her reality show &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;. She has also appeared in supporting roles in films.

Griffin was born in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. In 1978, she moved to Los Angeles, where she studied drama at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and became a member of the improvisational comedy troupe The Groundlings. In the 1990s, Griffin began performing as a stand-up comedian and appeared as a guest star on television shows, including a supporting role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; (1996–2000).

The Bravo reality show &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot; (2005–2010) became a ratings hit for the network and earned her two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality Program. Griffin has released six comedy albums, all of which received Grammy Award nominations. Her first album &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2008) made her the first female comedian to debut at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Comedy Albums chart. In 2009, she released her autobiography &quot;Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin&quot;. After being nominated for six years in a row for the Grammy for Best Comedy Album, she won the award in 2014.

Griffin has recorded numerous standup comedy specials for HBO and Bravo. For the latter network, she has recorded sixteen television specials, breaking the Guinness World record for the number of aired television specials on any network. In 2011, she also became the first comedian to have four specials televised in a year. Griffin is known for her controversial style and statements about celebrities, religion and sexuality, including holding a mask stylized as Donald Trump&#x27;s severed head in 2017, which provoked a United States Secret Service investigation and later became the basis of her concert film &quot;A Hell of a Story&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Kathleen Mary Griffin was born on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb Oak Park, Illinois, to Mary Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Griffin (née Corbally, 1920–2020) and John Patrick Griffin (1916–2007), both of whom were first-generation Irish-Americans. Kathy has four older siblings; Kenny (1942–2001), Joyce (1946–2017), Gary (1950–2014), and John. Kathy described herself during her early years as being &quot;a kid who needed to talk, all the time&quot;. Her brother Gary and her sister Joyce both died from cancer.

Kathy Griffin would often visit her neighbors to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows where she learned &quot;the power of juicy material&quot;. After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin developed a binge eating disorder. In her 2009 autobiography &quot;Official Book Club Selection&quot;, Griffin said she &quot;still suffers [from food issues]&quot; but has learned to &quot;deal with them&quot;.

Griffin&#x27;s eldest brother Kenny was a drug addict and homeless at various times; she said she was &quot;afraid of him until the moment he died&quot; because of his violent, abusive nature. When Kathy was seven, Kenny—who was twenty years older—would climb into her bed and whisper into her ears; Kathy did not tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point Kenny admitted his pedophilia to them.

At elementary school, Griffin began to develop a dislike for organized religion because of the punishments she and other &quot;vulnerable&quot; students received from the nuns. At her high school, she sought refuge in musical theater, playing roles such as Rosemary in &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; and Hodel in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. During her senior year, she wanted to become a professional actor. Her first appearance on television was as an extra on a Chicago White Sox commercial, and she was signed with several Chicago talent agencies. At 18, Griffin persuaded her parents to move to Los Angeles to help her become famous.

At 19, Griffin attended a performance by the improvisational group The Groundlings. She said, &quot;I thought this is where I want to be. This is the greatest thing in the world.&quot;

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy, television and film===
Griffin began performing in the early 1990s in the Los Angeles improvisational comedy troupe The Groundlings. She went on to perform standup comedy and became part of the alternative comedy scene in Los Angeles. With Janeane Garofalo, she created a standup act called &quot;Hot Cup of Talk&quot;, which became the title of her 1998 solo HBO special. Griffin earned a number of television and film credits during the 1990s. She appeared in Julie Brown&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a Showtime parody of the 1991 Madonna film &quot;&quot;. Griffin twice appeared as Susan Klein, a reporter on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;; it was her television sitcom debut.

On June 12, 2008, Griffin hosted the first Bravo! Canada A-List Awards, which included a parody of the &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; experienced by Janet Jackson in the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004. She also hosted the 2009 Bravo A-List Awards, which aired on April 15, 2009, and her Bravo special &quot;Kathy Griffin: She&#x27;ll Cut a Bitch&quot; aired beforehand. Shout! Factory released an extended version of the show on DVD in early 2010.

On September 8, 2009, Ballantine Books published Griffin&#x27;s memoir, titled &quot;Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin&quot;, which debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. A week prior, she released her second comedy album &quot;Suckin&#x27; It for the Holidays&quot;; it was her second bid to win a Grammy Award. It was announced on November 3, 2009, that Griffin was to host ABC&#x27;s new show &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, on which celebrity contestants would have re-enacted famous dance routines while competing for a $250,000 grand prize for their favorite charity.

Griffin hosted CNN&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcast on December 31, 2009, along with Anderson Cooper. As Cooper talked about the Balloon boy hoax, Griffin said &quot;fucking&quot;. Although Griffin was rumored to have been banned from future CNN broadcasts, she co-hosted the show with Cooper until 2017. In 2017, CNN terminated Griffin from its New Year&#x27;s Eve Broadcast after Griffin showed pictures of herself holding a bloody, model severed head resembling President Donald Trump. Griffin has also guest-starred in a 2009 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, playing a lesbian activist.

Since the 2008 presidential election, Griffin has made frequent jokes about Republican vice-presidential contender Sarah Palin and her family. On US television program &quot;Glee&quot;, Griffin parodied Palin posing as a judge at a regional singing competition. Griffin also made fun of Christine O&#x27;Donnell in the show by stating, &quot;Before we start, I would like to say I am not a witch&quot;.

On January 7, 2012, it was announced that Griffin would host a weekly one-hour talk show on the channel &quot;Kathy&quot;, which would consist of standup routines, &quot;rant about pop culture&quot;, and celebrity interviews. On April 8, 2013, during a live standup performance in Cincinnati, Ohio, Griffin announced that her show would not be renewed for a third season. She confirmed it later on her Twitter account. According to FOX 411, Bravo was planning to film several comedy specials starring Griffin after the show ended.

On June 13, 2014, it was announced that Griffin would host the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards. For the first time in the event&#x27;s four-decade history, the show bypassed a network television airing for a live online streaming media event. The ceremony took place on June 22, 2014. Griffin&#x27;s performance was well received by critics.

===Guest co-host of &quot;The View&quot;===
Kathy Griffin served as a co-host of &quot;The View&quot; from May 2007 to September 2007, replacing the recently departed Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.
She declined to discuss the ban on &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from &quot;The View&quot; and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. In an interview on &quot;The Talk&quot;, Griffin said that she has been re-banned from &quot;The View&quot; due to an argument with its co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

===Laugh Your Head Off World Tour 2017–2018===
In August 2017, Griffin announced a worldwide comedy tour. The title &quot;Laugh Your Head Off&quot; was a reference to her depiction of an effigy of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s severed head. The tour visited major cities in Singapore, Australia, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and many more European, and Asian cities. Several shows sold out within minutes of going on sale, leading to Griffin adding several shows to the lineup. She continued with a North America leg of the tour, commencing May 23, 2018, in Ottawa, Ontario and including both Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall in New York City.

==Controversies==
===Various talk shows bans===
Griffin said she was banned from appearing on several television shows including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;The View&quot;. She was re-banned from &quot;The View&quot; after making a joke about Barbara Walters. Griffin made a joke during a 2005 E! televised event saying that eleven-year-old actor Dakota Fanning had entered drug rehabilitation.

===Emmy Awards controversy===
The second season of &quot;My Life on the D-List&quot;, which premiered June 2006, earned Griffin the 2007 Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Reality Program in non-competition. She received it during the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, which was hosted by Carlos Mencia and aired on E! in September. Griffin said,

Griffin later said that she meant the remark to be a satire of celebrities who thank Jesus for their awards, especially artists who are controversial in their speech and actions, rather than as a slight on Jesus. The academy said her &quot;offensive remarks will not be part of the E! telecast on Saturday night&quot;. Griffin said that she was fired from an appearance on &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; because of her Emmy acceptance speech.

=== Ban from Apollo Theater ===
In a July 2009 episode of &quot;My Life on the D-List&quot;, Griffin used profanity in an Octomom joke during her routine at New York&#x27;s Apollo Theater. Griffin said that she received a letter banning her from the venue.

===Depiction of Donald Trump===
On May 30, 2017, Griffin posted a video of herself holding &quot;a mask styled to look like the severed, bloody head&quot; of then U.S. President Donald Trump. It was posted on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. She wrote: &quot;I caption this &#x27;there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his ... wherever&#x27;&quot;, referencing a comment Trump had made about Megyn Kelly. The video was from a session with photographer Tyler Shields, who is known for producing &quot;shocking&quot; imagery. Griffin later took down the image and apologized for posting the image, saying that she went too far and adding, &quot;I beg for your forgiveness&quot;.

On June 2, 2017, Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Griffin stated, &quot;Like many edgy works of artistic expression, the photo could be interpreted different ways. But Griffin never imagined that it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended. She has never threatened or committed an act of violence against anyone.&quot; Griffin said the Trump family was &quot;trying to ruin my life forever&quot;.

In May 2017, Griffin was dropped by Squatty Potty as a spokesperson. CNN fired her from its New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcast with Anderson Cooper. Cooper said, &quot;For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.&quot; All of Griffin&#x27;s remaining scheduled tour dates were canceled by their venues. During an interview on Australian television in August 2017, Griffin talked about the photo, saying, &quot;Stop acting like my little picture is more important than talking about the actual atrocities that the president of the United States is committing&quot;. In November 2017, she appeared on &quot;Skavlan&quot; where she said, &quot;I take that apology back by the way. I take it back big time&quot;. He said she had received a lot of bad advice at the time.

On October 28, 2017, Griffin uploaded a YouTube video titled &quot;Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story&quot;, which is about the backlash she received for the Trump photo controversy. It was the basis for her &quot;A Hell of a Story&quot; concert film. She said she was under a federal investigation by the Justice Department for two months and was on the No Fly List during that time. She also said that she was put on the Interpol list which is the Five Eyes list; she said that she had been detained at every airport during her &quot;Laugh Your Head Off World Tour&quot;.

On November 4, 2020 (her 60th birthday and the day after the 2020 United States presidential election), Griffin once again posted a photo of herself with a model of Donald Trump&#x27;s bloody, severed head.

===Twitter suspension===
On November 6, 2022, Griffin was suspended from Twitter for impersonating Elon Musk. Griffin used his profile photo and changed her name on the service, tweeting under his name imploring people to vote for Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections and encouraging them to retweet and spread her post. She also posted that she, posing as Musk, had decided to vote blue to support women&#x27;s rights. Musk tweeted the same day that anyone impersonating a public figure would be permanently suspended unless the account was clearly marked as parody. On the next day, Griffin posted on her deceased mother&#x27;s Twitter account, calling Musk an &quot;asshole&quot;. She further challenged the site&#x27;s policy that she had used her Twitter profile for impersonation. Musk tweeted sardonically in reply to another tweet, &quot;Actually she was suspended for impersonating a comedian.&quot; On November 18, Elon Musk announced that her account has been reinstated due to new rules concerning &quot;negative/hate tweets&quot;.

==Style of humor==
Griffin developed her love of popular culture through her immediate and extended family, who were frequently commenting about the latest news. She said; &quot;I may have been into &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; like every other kid, but I also wanted to watch John Lennon and Yoko Ono on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, and every minute of the Watergate hearings. It was
fear of the dinner table that got me hooked.&quot; She has also named her mother Maggie as influential in her consumption of pop culture, calling her &quot;the ideal audience for the Hollywood dish&quot;. Griffin named the character Rhoda Morgenstern of 1970s sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; as an influence.

Griffin established her career with candid observations of everyday life and her dating experiences, later focusing on mocking celebrities; her act currently consists of embellished stories involving celebrities. Griffin hopes people understand that no malice is intended by her humor. &quot;I&#x27;m genuinely a fan of most of the people I trash in the act&quot;, she said; &quot;I really, really try and focus on making fun of people for their behavior. I&#x27;m not so into making fun of someone for the way they look, or something that&#x27;s out of their control.&quot;

Griffin is sometimes the object of her own humor, particularly with regard to her D-list status. She portrays herself as a Hollywood outsider and has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, and Lance Bass. Her longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between Griffin and gossip blogger Perez Hilton.

In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends; &quot;There&#x27;s nothing I won&#x27;t do, but on the other hand I&#x27;m full of shit because that changes&quot;. Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin&#x27;s father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of Griffin&#x27;s show in 2007.

==LGBT rights and political advocacy==
Griffin is a supporter for LGBT rights including same-sex marriage. She has protested with fellow proponents in West Hollywood, California and included the footage from protests on her reality show &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;. Her mother was also a supporter of LGBT rights during her lifetime. She was often seen on the same television shows protesting alongside her daughter. Prior to the Proposition 8 ballot results, Griffin volunteered for the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center&#x27;s &quot;Vote for Equality&quot; campaign, going door-to-door asking Los Angeles residents for their opinion of LGBT marriage rights.

In March 2010, Griffin helped organize a rally in Washington, D.C., to advocate the repeal of &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;. She said that she organized the rally after meeting with several closeted gay people serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Griffin held meetings with several Members of Congress to encourage its repeal; she also organized a rally in Freedom Plaza.

Griffin caused controversy when she confronted Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann over her views on homosexuality at the 2010 Radio and Television Correspondents&#x27; Association Dinner; according to Griffin, she asked Bachmann &quot;were you born a bigot or did you grow into it&quot;, a reference to Bachmann&#x27;s belief that homosexuality is strictly environmental. Griffin said Bachmann replied, &quot;That&#x27;s a good question, I&#x27;ll have to think about that&quot;. Bachmann&#x27;s office confirmed the exchange but said Griffin confronted Bachmann after Bachmann approached Griffin to compliment her appearance.

Griffin is a long-time supporter of the Aid for AIDS annual fundraiser &quot;Best in Drag Show&quot; in Los Angeles, and hosted the opening of the show for more than five years. In November 2009, Aid For AIDS presented Kathy Griffin with an &quot;AFA Angel Award&quot; at their silver anniversary celebration.

Griffin is a long-time critic of Sarah Palin and has made fun of Palin&#x27;s daughter, Bristol Palin, using the Palin family as material for her comedy routines. In March 2011, Sarah Palin responded to Griffin by calling her a &quot;bully&quot;. In her reality television show, Griffin visited the Palin family home in Wasilla, Alaska, and invited Palin to attend her stand-up show in Anchorage, Alaska. Griffin has also poked fun at Willow Palin as a result of Palin&#x27;s Facebook statements on homosexuality.

In 2020, Griffin hosted the Str8Up Gay Porn Awards.

==Personal life==
Griffin is an atheist. Speaking to Sacramento&#x27;s &quot;Outword Magazine&quot;, Griffin said: &quot;I think I&#x27;m getting more atheist because of the way the country is getting more into bible-thumping&quot;. She also describes herself as a &quot;non-believer&quot;. In her book &quot;Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin&quot;, Griffin said that while in high school, she fell away from her Roman Catholic Church beliefs. She considered becoming a Unitarian but was not sure what that would involve. On March 9, 2008, Kathy Griffin became an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.

In a 2006 interview, Griffin said she does not drink alcohol. She is an opponent of LASIK eye surgery, having had a series of operations that left her partially blind in one eye with a visible eyeball deformity.

Griffin&#x27;s only sister, Joyce Patricia Griffin, died in September 2017 from an undisclosed form of cancer. Kathy had shaved her head in solidarity with her in late July. Her brother Gary died of esophageal cancer in 2014. Her estranged eldest brother, Kenny, died in October 2001 in their mother&#x27;s arms.

Her father, John Patrick Griffin, died of heart failure on February 17, 2007; he was 91 years old. The episode related to his death was aired on June 19, 2007. Her mother, Maggie Griffin, who was featured in her reality show, died on March 17, 2020. In a post on her social media accounts, Griffin said, &quot;I am gutted. My best friend. I am shaking. I won&#x27;t ever be prepared. I&#x27;m so grateful you guys got to be part of her life. You knew her. You loved her. She knew it. Oh, and OF COURSE she went on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.&quot;

She placed 17th on Oxygen&#x27;s 2007 list of &quot;The 50 Funniest Women Alive&quot;. In 2009, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.

Griffin lived in the Hollywood Hills from 2004 to 2016. Since then she has resided in Bel Air. In August 2021, she announced that she had been diagnosed with lung cancer although she is not a smoker, and needed to have half of her left lung removed. She underwent surgery the same month.

In April 2023, Griffin revealed she was diagnosed with an &quot;extreme case&quot; of complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

===Marriages and relationships===

Griffin married computer administrator Matt Moline in 2001, after being introduced by Moline&#x27;s sister, television producer Rebecca Moline. They divorced in May 2006. On &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Griffin accused Moline of stealing $72,000 from her; Moline did not respond to the allegation publicly but said that he was saddened by it.

In July 2007, rumors that Griffin was dating Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak circulated. Griffin and Wozniak attended the 2007 Emmy Awards together. On &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot; on February 6, 2008, Griffin confirmed her relationship with Wozniak. Wozniak and Griffin served as King and Queen of the Humane Society of Silicon Valley Fur Ball on April 5, 2008, in Santa Clara, California. In June 2008, it was confirmed that Griffin and Wozniak were no longer dating.

On August 9, 2009, Griffin attended the Teen Choice Awards with Levi Johnston and then interviewed him on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. In the interview, Griffin and Johnston joked that they were in a serious relationship.

On March 7, 2011, while appearing on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Griffin announced that she was romantically involved with actor and former NFL practice-squad player Isaiah Mustafa. He later said that he was single.

In the same interview, she said that the previous July, she had ended a four-year relationship with a man she did not identify but said he is &quot;a regular guy with a regular job&quot;, and that it was a &quot;messy breakup&quot;. It was later revealed that the man is Griffin&#x27;s tour manager, who had appeared on several seasons of &quot;My Life on the D List&quot;.

From 2012 until November 2018, Griffin was in a relationship with marketing executive Randy Bick. They also reconciled in April 2019. Griffin married Bick at her home on January 1, 2020, in a ceremony officiated by comedian Lily Tomlin. On December 29, 2023, Griffin filed for divorce from Bick, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on January 13, 2025.

<doc id="550271" wikidata="Q2066916" url="?curid=550271" title="Polish National District">
<text>Polish National Districts (called in Russian &quot;полрайоны&quot;, &quot;polrajony&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;польские национальные районы&quot;, &quot;Polish national raions&quot;) were national districts of the Soviet Union in the interbellum period providing national autonomy for Polish minorities in the Ukrainian and Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republics of the USSR. They were created in an attempt to live up to the postulate of Leninism about the rights of nations for self-determination. Also, creation of these regions served one of purposes of the Bolsheviks to export the revolution since after their defeat in the Polish-Soviet War, the Soviets did not give up their idea of creating a Soviet Republic in Poland. Polish National Districts were supposed to be the origin of future Soviet Poland. They both were disbanded in mid-1930s and a significant part of their populations (&quot;anti-Soviet and unreliable elements&quot;) was deported to Kazakhstan during the Great Purge.

==Origins==
The possibility of granting autonomy to Polish-populated areas of the Soviet Union was discussed during the Polish-Soviet war by key persons involved in the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee. However, there were no plans to create whole districts; autonomy would be granted to separate villages. In 1925 it was decided that a district would be created in Soviet Ukraine, where, according to the 1926 survey, 476,435 Poles lived. This was 1.6% of the Ukrainian population, but in the Zhitomir Oblast, their number reached 10%. Among persons who supported the district were Soviet communists of Polish origin, such as Feliks Kon, Julian Marchlewski, Felix Dzerzhinsky and Tomasz Dąbal. Thus Marchlewszczyzna was created, and later Dzierżyńszczyzna.

== Marchlewszczyzna ==
Marchlewszczyzna was a Polish National District of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic created as an experiment and as part of the Soviet Korenizatsia campaign on 21 July 1925 in to the west of Zhytomyr on resolution of Little Presidium of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. Its capital the town of Dovbysh, later in 1926, was renamed as Marchlewsk.

== Dzierżyńszczyzna ==

Dzierżyńszczyzna was a Polish National District (Дзержинский польский национальный район, Dzierzhynsky Polish national district) in Belarus, near Minsk and close to the Soviet-Polish border of the time. It was created on March 15, 1932, with its capital at Dzierżyńsk (formerly known as Kojdanava , so that initially it was established as &quot;Kojdanovsky Polish national district&quot;). It was named after the Cheka director Felix Dzerzhinsky.

Similarly to Marchlewszczyzna, limited Polish autonomy in the area was a real fact, with Polish-language schools, libraries and institutions. At the same time, the inhabitants were subject to intensive communist propaganda. Religious life was suppressed, and the campaign of collectivization, carried out in mid-1930s, met resistance of local Polish peasants. Unlike Marchlewszczyzna, which was the real center of Polish cultural life in the Soviet Union, Dzierżyńszczyzna&#x27;s influence was limited.

== Disbanding ==

Polish districts were among those which resisted Soviet collectivization and atheization. For political reasons, drastic measures were initially not applied in these areas. Eventually, Marchlewszczyzna was disbanded in 1935 at the onset of the Great Purge and most of the administration was executed. In the following years a significant part of population was deported to Kazakhstan and other remote areas of the Soviet Union.

Dzierżyńszczyzna was disbanded in 1937.

All Polish schools and libraries were closed, Tomasz Dąbal was executed in 1938.

After World War II, in both Polish and Soviet historiographies, the existence of the districts was omitted, perhaps because the authorities of both countries wanted to avoid uneasy questions about sudden rejection of the Leninist postulate of the rights of nations for self-determination.

The area of Marchlewszczyzna is still inhabited by the Polish minority, in the town of Dovbysh they make half of the population. There are also Poles in Dzierżyńszczyzna.

<text>USS &quot;Oldendorf&quot; (DD-972), named for Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf USN, was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi.

==Construction==
&quot;Oldendorf&quot; was the tenth &quot;Spruance&quot;- class destroyer and the first ship in the Navy named after Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, one of the most distinguished surface warfare flag officers to serve during World War II. She was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi beginning 27 December 1974. The ship was launched on 21 October 1975 and commissioned on 4 March 1978.

==Ship&#x27;s history==

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; was originally stationed in San Diego, California, although the ship&#x27;s first year was marked by shipyard work in Long Beach, California and another visit to Litton Shipbuilders in Pascagoula, Mississippi. This schedule meant three Panama Canal transits for most of the ship&#x27;s pre-commissioning crew within the a ship&#x27;s first 12 months of service.

During her first Westpac deployment which took place between May and November 1980 &quot;Oldendorf&quot; took part in a joint Australian-American-New Zealand anti-submarine exercise off the Western Australian coast during August 1980, which saw the destroyer conduct visits to the Western Australian town of Bunbury and the city of Perth.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; conducted her second Westpac deployment, this time with the aircraft carrier and her Carrier Battle Group in October 1981 to the Persian Gulf, during which &quot;Oldendorf&quot; returned to visit the Western Australian city of Perth. She returned home in May 1982 before undergoing an from September 1982 to July 1983, then conducted work ups for the ship&#x27;s third Westpac deployment which took place from January to May 1984.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; was re-based to Yokosuka, Japan as part of the United States Seventh Fleet in August 1984. She was a member of the battle group until being transferred to San Diego in 1991. During her time in the 7th Fleet she was involved with numerous events including regular exercises with all major navies in the area. In November 1986, along with and , she visited the port of Qingdao, China, the first group of US warships to visit mainland China since 1949. In 1988 &quot;Oldendorf&quot; deployed as part of the Seoul Olympics security force with the battle group for which she received the Meritorious Unit Citation. During two separate deployments &quot;Oldendorf&quot; was responsible for rescuing Vietnamese refugees fleeing governmental oppression and during mid-1989 &quot;Oldendorf&quot; was the first warship to be granted access to the small Australian village of Gove since 1975, when a seafaring naval tug was last to visit. &quot;Oldendorf&quot; had received approval from the Aboriginal tribe leaders to make a port of call there as a sign of good will to the US Navy. She received numerous awards for achievement and excellence. The commanding officer during her deployment to the Gulf War was Commander Cyrus H Butt IV. &quot;Oldendorf&quot; was part of the first United States response to the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. She served with distinction throughout the war earning the Combat Action Ribbon escorting the various major warships and supporting the naval blockade of Iraq. She returned to Japan in mid-1991. The summer of 1991 the ship changed its homeport to Long Beach, California for a year and a half long overhaul in the Long Beach Naval Shipyards. In late 1992 the command was shifted to her final homeport of San Diego. In early 1993 she participated in Joint Interdiction LEO operations with the USCG off the South American coast returning in March 1993.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; took part in the surface exercise Eager Sentry, as part of the larger Exercise Native Fury &#x27;94. Involving Kuwaiti and British military members, it was the largest naval exercise ever conducted in Kuwait. It was conducted from 4 April through 25 April, to demonstrates U.S. resolve to support the peace in the Persian Gulf region after ousting Iraq from Kuwait three years prior. Native Fury comprised several exercises under one umbrella. In the namesake exercises, two Maritime Prepositioning Ships sailed from their homeport of Diego Garcia and discharged more than 1,000 tanks, artillery pieces and vehicles at the port of Shuaibah, starting 5 April. Approximately 2,000 marines and sailors from I Marine Expeditionary Force, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Force Service Support Group and Naval Beach Group One arrived by air, off-loaded and convoyed the equipment to a training range north of Kuwait City. There, they trained with the Kuwaiti Army and British Royal Marines, perfecting tactics which would delay, and perhaps turn back, any repeat of the invasion of Kuwait. Other elements of Native Fury involved the surface exercise Eager Sentry; Eager Archer, an aerial exercise; and Eager Express with explosive ordnance disposal units training on the southern Kuwaiti beaches.
As part of a reorganization by the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, with the reorganization scheduled to be completed by 1 October 1995, and homeport changes to be completed within the following, year, &quot;Oldendorf&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 23.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; departed on 1 December 1995, as part of the Battle Group, for a regularly scheduled Western Pacific deployment.

In March 1996, and in response to the announcement of missile tests and military live-fire exercises to be conducted by the Chinese in the waters surrounding the island of Taiwan, the United States dispatched forward deployed naval assets, including a carrier and other combatants to the area to monitor the situation. and other units in its battle group, operating in international waters, were on the scene from the beginning of the exercises. However, to augment the monitoring efforts, and further demonstrate U.S. commitment to peace and stability in the region, &quot;Nimitz&quot; and elements of its battle group, including &quot;Oldendorf&quot;, were ordered to sail from the Persian Gulf to the Western Pacific earlier than planned, after two months in the Persian Gulf for Operation Southern Watch.
&quot;Oldendorf&quot; took part, from 13 April through 24 April in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise 98-1 (PAC JTFEX 98-1) off the Southern California coast. The aim of the exercise was to prepare naval forces to participate in joint operations with other U.S. forces. Naval operations included Maritime Interception Operations (MIO), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), various air strike and support missions, operational testing of various weapons systems, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), logistics support, search and rescue, and command and control. An amphibious landing at Camp Pendleton, California, on 21 April, involved Navy surface and helicopter assault forces, U.S. Air Force aircraft, as well as units from Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; deployed on 9 November 1998, for a six-month overseas assignment, as part of the battle group. Joining &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; battle group and the &quot;Boxer&quot; ARG were to relieve the battle group and the ARG, which had been forward deployed for the previous five months to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; arrived on station in the Persian Gulf with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; battle group and took part in Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. The operation was designed to degrade Saddam Hussein&#x27;s ability to deliver chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and wage war against his neighbors. It also took part in Operation Southern Watch. The &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; battle group, led by &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) Eleven departed the Persian Gulf on 18 March 1999, after spending three intense months supporting Operations Southern Watch and Desert Fox in Southern Iraq. The ships returned home in May.

As of early 2000, developmental tests were in progress on &quot;Oldendorf&quot; as part of the SPQ-9B Radar Improvement Program. The program aimed at using COTS systems and NDI to improve the performance of the AN/SPQ-9 Radar in the Mk 86 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS), which would be integrated into the Mk 1 Ship Self-Defense System.

In August 2000, &quot;Oldendorf&quot; was directed to the scene of a crash into the Persian Gulf, on 23 August, by a commercial passenger jet, in order to assist in the recovery of the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. The jet, a twin-engine Airbus A320 operated by Gulf Air which originated in Cairo, plunged into shallow water about 3 to 4 miles north of Bahrain International Airport while making its approach. &quot;Oldendorf&quot; was relieved of this duty by , which was much closer to the proximity of the site of the crash. The bodies of all 143 people aboard the aircraft were recovered.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; took part in the first Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) of 2001 during the month of February. Together with the Special Operations Capable certification (SOCCERT), the JTFEX aimed at providing progressive and realistic pre-deployment training for a carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group, a Marine Expeditionary Unit and other deployers. The name Joint Task Force Exercise reflects the focus on preparing naval forces to participate fully in joint operations with other U.S. forces and the armed forces of allied countries. Naval operations included Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), various air strike and support missions, operational testing of various weapons systems, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), logistics support, search and rescue and command and control. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps forces were joined in the exercise by U.S. Air Force aircraft as well as units from Canada.

==Sea swap==
The U.S. Navy Surface Force was scheduled to begin, in the summer of 2002, an initiative to test the effectiveness of deploying a single ship for 18 months while swapping out crews at six-month intervals. Called Sea Swap, this initial two-phased initiative would involve three &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers (DDs) – , and &quot;Oldendorf&quot;, and three s (DDGs) – , and . For the DD phase, &quot;Fletcher&quot; and her crew would deploy with their battle group this summer, but after six months, only the crew would return. The ship would remain deployed and be crewed by sailors from &quot;Kinkaid&quot;. After completing their training cycle and decommissioning &quot;Kinkaid&quot;, these sailors would fly to a port in either Australia or Singapore to assume ownership of &quot;Fletcher&quot; and steam her back on-station. After six months, they would be replaced by the crew from &quot;Oldendorf&quot; who would have completed the same training and decommissioning schedule with their ship before flying out to relieve the &quot;Kinkaid&quot; crew. After four more months on station, the &quot;Oldendorf&quot; crew would then bring &quot;Fletcher&quot; back to the United States where it too would be decommissioned. Additionally, by executing this plan, the Navy would be able to eliminate the deployment of because the additional on-station time generated by swapping out the crews meant a ship would already be in theater meeting that requirement.

&quot;Oldendorf&quot; was decommissioned 20 June 2003 and berthed at Bremerton, Washington NISMF. She was stricken 6 April 2004. The ship was sunk as a target during a live-fire exercise off the coast of Washington by the on 22 August 2005

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The design of the &quot;Oldendorf&quot; crest is composite of emblems representing Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s achievements during his illustrious career. The shield commemorates Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s crossing of the &quot;T&quot; in the epic sea Battle of Surigao Strait during World War II, which resulted in a brilliant and decisive victory for the United States.

The vertical blue bar, alluding to a narrow passage or waterway, refers to Surigao Strait, and the eight red and white sections of the background represents the total losses of the enemy in terms of the number of ships sunk, damaged or crippled. The blue chief at the top crossing of the &quot;T&quot; battle plan, with upper section simulating red sky over the night battle of Surigao Strait. The four stars denote Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s highest rank. The crest symbolizes the award of the Navy Cross, The Navy&#x27;s highest decoration, awarded to Admiral Oldendorf for exceptional leadership and heroism in the Battle of Surigao Strait. The trident signifies authority and power and the annulet with red center suggest the muzzle of a gun in action. The two wavy bars are indicative of World War II and the Pacific area. The ship&#x27;s motto, &quot;Ad Proelium Victoriamque Futuram&quot; (To the Fight and Victory Ahead) is the Latin translation of a line taken from Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s memoirs regarding his charge to his forces on the eve of the decisive Battle of Surigao Strait.

<text>Donald William Cameron (May 20, 1946May 3, 2021) was a Canadian politician who served as the 22nd premier of Nova Scotia from February 1991 to June 1993. He represented the electoral district of Pictou East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1974 to 1993, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia. Following his political career, he was appointed the Canadian Consul General to New England.

==Early life and education==
Cameron was born in Egerton, Nova Scotia, on May 20, 1946. His parents were Helen and William David Cameron, and he was raised on their family farm. He graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1968.

==Political career==
Cameron entered provincial politics in the 1974 election, defeating Liberal Lester MacLellan by 272 votes in the Pictou East riding. He was re-elected in the 1978 election by almost 2,000 votes. On October 5, 1978, Cameron was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Fisheries and Minister of Recreation. He resigned from cabinet on June 25, 1980. He was re-elected in the 1981 and 1984 elections. On April 20, 1988, Cameron was reappointed to cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology. Cameron was re-elected in the 1988 election, defeating Liberal Wayne Fraser by 753 votes.

In September 1990, John Buchanan resigned as premier, and a leadership convention was scheduled for February 1991. On November 2, 1990, Cameron announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia. At the leadership convention, on February 9, 1991, Cameron led through the first two ballots and defeated Roland J. Thornhill by 143 votes on the third ballot to win the leadership. He was sworn in as the 22nd premier of Nova Scotia on February 26.

===Premier of Nova Scotia===
Cameron&#x27;s administration was known for a smaller cabinet, supporting anti-discrimination measures, and amending the human rights act to extend protection to gays and lesbians. His government also privatized Nova Scotia Power Incorporated, the largest privatization move in Canada at the time. Cameron also introduced merit-based hiring codes, signed on to the Atlantic Procurement Agreement and introduced mandatory testing in grades 3, 6, 9 and 12 with public release of test scores. Cameron&#x27;s government established a nonpartisan electoral boundaries revision commission in an attempt to end gerrymandering.

Cameron began the practice of non-political appointment of judges, deregulation of gasoline prices and made investments in double-stack rail service from the Port of Halifax (benefitting the TrentonWorks rail car plant in his riding) as well as four-lane highways. His efforts in ending party patronage marked a change in politics in Nova Scotia that his successors – John Savage and John Hamm – were able to continue, making appointments more transparent.

Cameron was noted as a vocal supporter of a development project that turned deadly. He was instrumental, first as a local MLA, then as industry minister in the government of John Buchanan, and then as premier, in the development of the Westray Mine in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. Many expressed concern in the provincial media for the safety of workers in such a mine. While coal mining typically releases explosive methane gas, the location of the mine was in an area of Pictou County that had an unusually high level of methane. However, despite the opposition from federal bureaucrats, opposition politicians and the Cape Breton Development Corporation (Devco), a federal crown agency responsible for coal mining in Cape Breton, Westray Mine was developed through the late eighties and opened in 1991 with significant provincial and federal government assistance. Subsequently, a methane gas explosion killed 26 miners on May 9, 1992.

Cameron&#x27;s government is also remembered for continuing the Buchanan policy in supporting development of the controversial Point Aconi Generating Station project.

In the 1993 election, Cameron won personal re-election in his Pictou East riding, but his government was defeated in a landslide by the Nova Scotia Liberal Party under John Savage. On election night, Cameron announced his resignation as both party leader and MLA for Pictou East.

==Personal life==
Cameron married Rosemary Simpson in 1969. They met while studying at McGill. Together, they had three children: Natalie, David, and Christine.

Cameron died at Aberdeen Hospital in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia on May 3, 2021, at the age of 74.

<text>:&quot;See also&quot; &quot;USS&quot; Young &quot;for similarly named ships.&quot;

USS &quot;John Young&quot; (DD-973), named for Captain John Young, USN, was a of the United States Navy. The ship was built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi.

==Service history==

In 1987, &quot;John Young&quot; deployed off the coast of Iran in support of Operation Earnest Will and participated in Operation Nimble Archer. &quot;John Young&quot; deployed with Battle Group Echo, which included the aircraft carrier , battleship , cruisers , , destroyers and , frigates , , , and auxiliaries , , , .

&quot;John Young&quot;, following appropriate Congressional notification, became one of eight combat ships that began receiving women as crewmembers in 1994.

As part of a reorganization by the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, with the reorganization scheduled to be completed by 1 October 1995, and homeport changes to be completed within the following, year, &quot;John Young&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 23.

&quot;John Young&quot; departed San Diego on 9 February 1996 enroute to the Persian Gulf for a six-month deployment as part of the Middle East Force (MEF). This deployment was remarkable because a main engineering space was completely gutted and refitted following a major fuel oil leak just days before that trapped several crew members in thirty thousand gallons of fuel. The ship was having extensive last-minute pre-deployment repairs, requiring most of the installed firefighting systems to be disabled. Also, the fire-proof escape doors in all the engineering spaces were temporarily removed for repairs. Had the fuel ignited, it would have been catastrophic to not only John Young, but the many ships nearby in port.

On 28 April 1996, a Navy boarding team aboard &quot;John Young&quot; boarded a merchant ship thus marking the 10,000th such boarding in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. As part of a multinational maritime interception force, operating in the Persian Gulf, the team boarded an Indian flagged dhow in the Persian Gulf to make the milestone boarding. The vessel was empty and permitted to proceed.

&quot;John Young&quot; departed San Diego on 18 November 1997 en route to the Persian Gulf for a six-month deployment as part of the Middle East Force (MEF).

&quot;John Young&quot; teamed up with a Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) in late March 2001 for a major drug bust at sea. She was last stationed at San Diego, California.

== Fate ==
&quot;John Young&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 2002, and stricken 6 November 2002, laid up at Bremerton, Washington NISMF. On 13 April 2004, &quot;John Young&quot; was sunk during exercise RIMPAC 04 by a Mark 48 torpedo fired by the submarine , which broke her in half.

<text>Daucus is a worldwide genus of herbaceous plants of the celery family Apiaceae of which the best-known species is the cultivated carrot. &quot;Daucus&quot; has about 45 species. The oldest carrot fossil is 1.3 Ma, and was found on the island of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean.

== Description ==
Members of &quot;Daucus&quot; are distinguished within the family &quot;Apiaceae&quot; by their leaves which are 2–3 pinnatisect with narrow end sections. The genus primarily consists of biennial plants but also includes some annual plants and some perennial herbs. All &quot;Daucus&quot; have bristly stems. The inflorescences are umbels. The flowers are mostly white, with bracts and bracteoles. The petals may be pure white, reddish, pinkish or yellowish. They are emarginate above and have pointed, wrapped lobules. The petals are often unequal in size, with petals at the outermost edge of the inflorescence often being larger. The fruit is an ovoid to ellipsoidal schizocarp, cylindrical or compressed, with ciliate primary ribs and secondary ribs with a row of hooked spines. Some species have a small pale or white edible taproot, similar to a radish, which may or may not be bitter in taste.

==Ecology==
&quot;Daucus&quot; pollination is carried out by insects, primarily: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.
It is a cosmopolitan genus with endemic species on most continents as well as on many islands and in isolated areas. The genus centre is in North Africa and Southwest Asia in the Temperate Zone. Prolonged dry or cold weather tends to retard growth in &quot;Daucus&quot; species, but the genus as a whole is evolutionarily adaptive to these conditions. Some &quot;Daucus&quot; species accumulate substantial resources in large underground taproots without impeding plant development. Native to Europe is the carrot, with several subspecies, including subsp. carota (wild carrot), subsp. gummifer (sea carrot) and subsp. &quot;sativus&quot;, a cultivated form of carrot, also called garden carrot).

Four members of the Daucus genus were examined to determine differences in isoenzyme patterns and plastid DNA. The four were: &quot;Daucus carota&quot; subspecies &quot;sativus&quot; cultivar Danvers, &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;gummifer&quot;, &quot;D. capillifolius&quot;, and &quot;D. pusillus&quot;. Although only one form of HSDH (homoserine dehydrogenase) was present in each &quot;Daucus&quot; line, the rate of migration of HSDH from cv. Danvers was different from that of the others. Multiple isoenzymic forms of ADH were present in each &quot;Daucus&quot; cultivar. Comparison of endonuclease restriction fragment patterns from plastid DNAs digested by BamHI revealed only small differences between plastid DNAs of cv. Danvers and subsp. &quot;gummifer&quot;, whereas large differences were observed between cv. Danvers and &quot;D. pusillus&quot; plastid DNA patterns. No differences were found between cv. Danvers and &quot;D. capillifolius&quot; plastid DNA patterns when examined using eight different restriction enzymes. The data indicate that specific isoenzyme and organelle DNA restriction fragment patterns will be useful markers for precise identification of genomes of different &quot;Daucus&quot; species.

<text>USS &quot;Comte de Grasse&quot; (DD-974), named for Admiral Francois-Joseph Paul, Comte de Grasse (1722–1788), was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi.
She was laid down 4 April 1975, launched 26 March 1976 and commissioned 5 August 1978. She was christened 21 May 1976 by sponsor Madame Anne-Aymone Sauvage de Brantes, wife of the then-President of France, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing.

<doc id="550295" wikidata="Q2470582" url="?curid=550295" title="USS O'Brien (DD-975)">
<text>USS &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; (DD-975) was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. It was named for Captain Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien and his five brothers: Gideon, John, William, Dennis and Joseph. The O&#x27;Briens were crew members on board the sloop &quot;Unity&quot;, which captured HMS &quot;Margaretta&quot; at the entrance to Machias harbor on 12 June 1775. &quot;O’Brien&quot; was decommissioned on 24 September 2004, and was later sunk as part of a training exercise in 2006.

== History ==
The destroyer has completed seven major deployments to the Western Pacific/Indian Oceans and seven deployments to the Persian Gulf.

During her third deployment (13 January 1984 – 1 August 1984), which included 81 consecutive days at sea in the Indian Ocean, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; took part in two refugee rescue missions, earning the Humanitarian Service Medal.

&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;″s fourth western pacific deployment (January 1986 – June 1986) took the destroyer further north. Operations included joint U.S./Korean naval exercises TEAM SPIRIT 86 and TAE KWAN DO 86-1. Ports visited: Subic Bay and Manila, Philippines; Okinawa, Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; Pohang and Pusan, Korea; Hong Kong

Following the installation of an advanced towed array sonar system in 1987, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; conducted experimental sonar evaluation operations in the Northern Pacific and Bering Sea.

During her fifth deployment, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; became part of the Middle East Force. &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; participated in Operation Earnest Will, escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers, and Operation Praying Mantis, during which &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; was a key member of the three-ship surface action group that engaged and sank the Iranian guided missile frigate .

&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; underwent an extensive overhaul and received major weapon systems improvements in 1988 including the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) for the Tomahawk cruise missile, the SQR-1 tactical towed array sonar system and the LAMPS MK III helicopter system.

While assigned to the Middle East Force from September to December 1990, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; participated in Operation Desert Shield. Conducting Persian Gulf patrols in support of the United Nations embargo of Iraq, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; investigated over four hundred vessels.

In December 1991 and again from February to April 1992, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; conducted counter narcotic operations off the coasts of Central and South America.

In August 1992, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; departed San Diego to become a member of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces. En route from San Diego to Yokosuka, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; conducted follow-on testing and evaluation of the vertically launched anti-submarine rocket and the SQQ-89 sonar system on the Pacific Missile Test Range off Kauai, Hawaii. &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, in October 1992.

In June 1993, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; departed Yokosuka for her third deployment to the Middle East Force where she conducted Persian Gulf patrols in support of Operation Southern Watch and surveillance operations in the Gulf of Oman.

&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; participated in several joint exercises with the U.S. Marines and Air Force, as well as combined exercises with the Armed Forces of Singapore, Brunei, and the Republic of Korea. &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; departed on her fourth Middle East Force deployment on 17 February 1995 and continued to conduct operations in support of the United Nations embargo on Iraq.

&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;″s operational tempo remained very high throughout 1996, including her fifth Middle East Force Deployment, participating in the large naval exercise RIMPAC &#x27;96 as well as a member of the Taiwan contingency force. During Pacific Middle East Force (PACMEF), &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; continued conducting operations in support of the United Nations embargo on Iraq and her efforts resulted in the seizure of over 1.5 million gallons of contraband oil.

&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; was away from homeport for 233 days in 1996, but was awarded with the Battle E Device, Meritorious Unit Commendation, Humanitarian Service Award and then nominated for the prestigious Spokane Trophy.

In 1999, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; participated in exercises with the Philippine Navy and in CROCEX &#x27;99 with the Royal Australian Navy.

2000 was yet another high tempo year with 188 days spent underway. &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; participated in Counter Special Operations Forces Exercise (CSOFEX) in Korea, COBRA Gold 2000, East Timor operations and completed an entire tactical training cycle in a record 19 days.
All of the previous years&#x27; hard work paid off in 2001 when &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; participated in PACMEF &#x27;01, conducting maritime interdiction operations, including boarding over thirty merchant vessels throughout the summer in the Persian Gulf. On 11 September, &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; emergency sortied from Bahrain to the Arabian Sea. She participated in the opening Tomahawk cruise missile strikes into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

=== Sinking ===
In early 2006, the ex-USS &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; was sunk by missiles from , shells from and two P3C Orion patrol aircraft in a combined fleet training exercise off the Pacific Missile Range Facility near Kauai, Hawaii.

== Ship&#x27;s crest ==
&quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;″s official crest, as exhibited, symbolizes the rich tradition of courage and determination initiated by Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien, and continued by those ships that bore his name.

The golden pile and its associated elements are resplendent in symbolism. The pile, in conjunction with the way bars, represents a ship at sea and is symbolic of the grand tradition of the U.S. Navy. Taken by itself, the pile also represents the Roman numeral &quot;V&quot;, equaling the total number of ships, including DD-975, to be honored with the name of &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;. The shamrock centered at the top of the pile alludes to Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Irish ancestry and, in addition, to the arms of the previous .

The crossed nautical tridents overlapped by the single cannon dedicate the first naval battle of the American Revolution in which Jeremiah O’Brien and his men defeated the British warship, &quot;Margaretta&quot;. O&#x27;Brien and his men, armed with only limited muskets, axes, and pitchforks (represented by the crossed tridents) boarded &quot;Margaretta&quot; and defeated an enemy armed with superior guns and training.

Pine trees on either side of the cannon symbolize the state of Maine, the home of Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien and the site of his famed victory. Reflected in the ship&#x27;s motto, &quot;Loyalty, Unity, Freedom&quot;, are the qualities of Captain O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s contribution to the American Revolution. The motto also displays the guile of a long line of U.S. Navy sailors on ships named &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

==History==
William Nicoll, a son of New York City Mayor Matthias Nicoll, became a patentee in the 1680s of the east end of what is now the Town of Islip. He accumulated over and named his estate Islip, after the Nicolls&#x27; ancestral home in East Northamptonshire, England. His domain included what are now the hamlets of Islip, East Islip, Bayport, Sayville, West Sayville, Oakdale, Great River, Islip Terrace, Central Islip, Hauppauge, Holbrook, Bohemia, Brentwood, Holtsville, and a portion of Ronkonkoma. This land was purchased from Winnequaheagh, Sachem of Connetquot in 1683. The annual fee paid to Governor Thomas Dongan of New York was five bushels of good winter wheat or 25 shillings.

The name &quot;Islip&quot; was chosen by local residents for their local post office when it opened in 1802. Islip was originally a farming community, gradually transforming into a posh enclave for wealthy families in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Romanesque Revival, Federal, Moorish and Victorian mansions that once lined the streets of Islip have been razed, though some remain, adjacent to many newer, large homes. Islip has a wealth of extant Queen Anne Revival homes. Located along the picturesque Great South Bay, Islip has a long history associated with fishing, clamming (the world-famous Doxsee Clam Company started in Islip), swimming and boating. Islip Hamlet has its own public bathing beach, under the jurisdiction of the town. Boating and yachting are as popular today as they were years ago, if not more so, with the development of the communities on the adjacent barrier beach of Fire Island.

<text>Groupaction Inc. is a Canadian advertising agency at the centre of the 2004 Canadian sponsorship scandal. It was incorporated in 1983 as Groupaction Marketing Inc. and received its first federal advertising contract in 1994 with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). 

According to a 2006 news report by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, following the 1995 referendum on Quebec sovereignty, rumours were heard about a fund being set up by the Canadian Government to support federalism.

By September 2004, John Gomery was heading an inquiry into the Canadian Federal Sponsorship Program.

<text>USS &quot;Merrill&quot; (DD-976), named for Rear Admiral Aaron Stanton Merrill USN (1890–1961), was a that entered service with the United States Navy in 1978. &quot;Merrill&quot; served as the US Navy&#x27;s test platform for the Tomahawk cruise missile. In the 1980s, the destroyer took part in Operation Earnest Will in the Persian Gulf during heightened tensions with Iran. The destroyer was decommissioned in 1998. The vessel was used as a target ship in 2003 and sunk off Hawaii in 2003.

==Service history==
&quot;Merill&quot; was laid down on 16 June 1975 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 1 September 1976 and commissioned on 11 March 1978.

On 21 August 1980, while on a Western Pacific Ocean deployment, &quot;Merrill&quot; rescued 62 Vietnamese refugees, over southeast of Saigon. During the next years, &quot;Merrill&quot; served as the Navy&#x27;s test platform for the Tomahawk Cruise Missile Program, earning the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. In this function, the ship did not participate in the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s deployment rotation.

In 1986, while serving as flagship for Destroyer Squadron 21 (COMDESRON 21), &quot;Merrill&quot; was deployed to the Western Pacific as part of Battle Group Romeo, which featured as its centerpiece the battleship , and as such became the first Battleship Battle Group to sail since aircraft carriers assumed that role during World War II.

In 1989, &quot;Merrill&quot; stood out on a deployment to the Middle East. Serving as a unit of Joint Task Force Middle East, the ship conducted operations in support of Operation Earnest Will and was back in San Diego in May 1990. In August 1990 &quot;Merrill&quot; was host to the Soviet Navy in San Diego.

Assigned to the carrier battle group, &quot;Merrill&quot; again deployed to the Middle East in 1991. On the way to Persian Gulf &quot;Merrill&quot; took part in Operation Fiery Vigil in June 1991. Arriving in the region after the ceasefire of the Gulf War, &quot;Merrill&quot; became the flagship for the coalition minesweeping forces in the Persian Gulf and was the second warship to visit the liberated port of Kuwait City after the Iraqi invasion. 1992 found &quot;Merrill&quot; underway on a counter-narcotics deployment in the Central America area of operations. In September 1992 &quot;Merrill&quot; was sent to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which lasted into late 1993. This overhaul consisted of upgrades to the control panels of the radar systems, an entire level added to the ship to contain previously installed CIWS control computers, and most importantly, RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) was added to the entire ship, a first for a destroyer. Upon receiving notice of the planned closure of Long Beach, The USS Merrill relocated to San Diego Naval Base in 1994 and spent the next few months as a test platform in deployment for the RAM material, which was designed to make the ship appear as small as a tug boat on radars.

&quot;Merrill&quot; deployed in 1995 as part of the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; battle group. During the first half of the deployment, the battle group conducted a variety of multinational operations and exercises designed to support U.S. interests and relationships in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Persian Gulf. The battle group maintained a continuous watch on all merchant shipping going to and from Iraq. Numerous ships were queried and boarded to verify their cargo manifests.

In July 1995, as part of a reorganization of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, &quot;Merrill&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 7. The reorganization was scheduled to be completed by 1 October, with homeport changes to be completed within the following year.

From 10 February through 21 February 1997, &quot;Merrill&quot; took part in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise (PACJTFEX) 97-1, off the Southern California coast. The U.S. 3rd Fleet exercise involved 20 ships, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the carrier battle group and Amphibious Ready Group with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked. Army, Air Force, National Guard and Coast Guard units also participated. The exercise included various air strike and support missions, maritime interdiction operations, humanitarian operations, operational testing of weapons systems, logistics support, search and rescue, and command and control. Amphibious operations supporting the exercise culminated with an amphibious landing at Camp Pendleton, California, involving surface and helicopter assault forces. PAC JTFEX 97-1 was part of a series of exercises previously named &quot;FLEETEX&quot;. The change in name reflected the increasing focus on preparing naval forces for joint operations with other U.S. military services. During the previous several years this exercise placed increasing emphasis on incorporating joint procedures, planning, and command and control structures into task group training.

&quot;Merrill&quot; then deployed with the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group, as part of a routine six-month deployment in the waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group departed Fifth Fleet&#x27;s Area of Responsibility (AOR) on 17 August 1997. The battle group had entered the Arabian Sea on 16 May, and conducted high tempo operations there that included more than 4,400 sorties during more than 10 weeks in the Persian Gulf. Operations included exercises with friendly forces in the region. After departing the Persian Gulf, the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group concluded its tour in the 5th Fleet with a joint-combined exercise with the Pakistani Armed Forces. Dubbed Inspired Siren 97-2 and Inspired Alert 97-2, the exercises incorporated both surface combatants and air components, respectively. The purpose of this four-day training mission was to exercise the joint-combined naval and air capabilities of both countries, improve their respective levels of readiness and interoperability, and enhance military relations between the two nations.

===Fate===
&quot;Merrill&quot; was decommissioned and stricken 26 March 1998 awaiting disposal at Pearl Harbor Naval Intermediate Ship Maintenance Facility. On 1 August 2003 she was sunk as a target northwest of Hawaii. The wreckage is located at .

<text>Cathy is an American gag-a-day comic strip, drawn by Cathy Guisewite from 1976 until 2010. The comic follows Cathy, a woman who struggles through the &quot;four basic guilt groups&quot; of life: food, love, family, and work. The strip gently pokes fun at the lives and foibles of modern women. The strip&#x27;s debut was on November 22, 1976, and it appeared in over 1,400 newspapers at its peak. The strips have been compiled into more than 20 books. Three television specials were also created. Guisewite received the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award in 1992 for the strip.

==History==

Initially, the strip was based largely on Guisewite&#x27;s own life as a single woman. &quot;The syndicate felt it would make the strip more relatable if the character&#x27;s name and my name were the same,&quot; Guisewite said in an interview. &quot;They felt it would make it a more personal strip, and would help people know it was a real woman who was going through these things. I hated the idea of calling it &#x27;Cathy&#x27;. Guisewite had Cathy&#x27;s long-time boyfriend, Irving, propose on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2004. The two characters married in the February 5, 2005 strip. That same year, Cathy appeared in the 75th anniversary party of Blondie and Dagwood.

On August 11, 2010, Cathy Guisewite announced the decision to end the run of &quot;Cathy&quot;. On October 3, 2010, the final strip ran with the revelation that Cathy is pregnant with a girl.

On June 1, 2020, &quot;Cathy Commiserations&quot;, a single-panel cartoon, began on GoComics. The earliest entry was dated March 20, 2018. The series paused May 9, 2021, but resumed on October 29, 2021.

==Main and supporting characters==
* Cathy Andrews Hillman: the protagonist of the strip and the only one not shown with a nose (although a small one was occasionally seen in side views). Cathy is also the only character that does not have beady eyes; instead, hers are drawn in an inverted heart-shape.
* Andrea: Cathy&#x27;s feminist foil and best friend. Andrea&#x27;s role was reduced in the later years. Andrea is married to Luke, whom she met during an online chat, and has two children, Zenith and Gus, who grew from infants to uninhibited teens (not seen in the strips), illustrating—especially Zenith—that the characters do age, albeit very slowly. With Zenith, Andrea was obsessed with motherhood, to the point of eating special diets while pregnant and playing music on headphones into her pregnant womb to ensure her baby was born with a high IQ, and then bonding so tightly with Zenith that she understood her baby babble perfectly. Gus, however, entered a playgroup and she did not have as strong a connection with him (which initially left her distraught).
* Electra: Cathy&#x27;s dog—rescued from the animal shelter as a puppy.
* Vivian: Irving&#x27;s dog—also a rescue dog from the shelter. Both Cathy and Irving said that the dogs rescued them.
* Anne Andrews: Cathy&#x27;s mother. Just as likely to provide frustration as inspiration. Refused to throw anything out, even online. Was highly marriage obsessed and was constantly either asking Cathy when she was getting married or trying to fix her up.
* Bill Andrews: Cathy&#x27;s father. More often than not, a helpless bystander to Cathy&#x27;s mom. Cathy went to him when she needed advice about work, something Cathy&#x27;s mom (even though she had created jobs—M.O.Ms, Mothers on the Move, or Granny Nannies, the day-care centre in Flo&#x27;s house) said she knows little about.
* Charlene McGuire: one of Cathy&#x27;s best friends, receptionist at her office. Charlene&#x27;s role expanded greatly once Andrea got married. Charlene announced her pregnancy on Sunday, May 20, 2007.
* Simon: Charlene&#x27;s husband. He and Cathy dated ten times before she decided that he wasn&#x27;t for her. But (at first) Cathy was adamant that Charlene should have adhered to the &quot;woman&#x27;s rules&quot; one of which is to never date a woman&#x27;s old boyfriend. He and Charlene broke up briefly, which led to both her and Cathy signing up for video dating, but they eventually got back together.
* Irving Hillman: former on-again-off-again love interest, golf and electronics addict and her husband as of February 5, 2005. The more complex the machinery, the better he liked it—even if he did not understand how to set it up.
* Mr. Earl Pinkley: Cathy&#x27;s boss, who often managed to make what little control he actually had of his work environment go a very long way. At one point, he sexually harassed Cathy by coming on to her in her apartment. Cathy solved the problem by telling Charlene what really happened and the gossip about her boss &quot;spending the night&quot; (he forgot to mention it was due to the fact that he was knocked out when Cathy punched him in the nose).
* Mrs. Hillman: Irving&#x27;s mother. She did everything in her power to aggravate Cathy, especially regarding the 2007 Hillman family reunion.
* Mr. Hillman: Irving&#x27;s father. He seemed content to let his wife do all the talking.
* Mabel: a Frank Nelson-type character who would show up as the salesperson at any given store, bank, travel agency etc. that Cathy or other characters went to (including Andrea&#x27;s nurse when she had Zenith), always had a pencil in her hair, and whose interactions would usually escalate until she or her customer had a meltdown. She sometimes had a co-worker with her. In at least one strip, the co-worker was referred to as Edith.
* Emerson was one of the first boyfriends introduced (Irving was first) when the strip debuted. He pursued Cathy who figured she could do better and irritated Irving. He was eventually dropped in favor of Irving, but is often mentioned in Cathy&#x27;s list of those she dated.

==Animated specials==

Three animated specials were made from the strip: &quot;Cathy&quot;, &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Last Resort&quot; and &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Valentine&quot;. All aired on CBS, and the former won Guisewite an Emmy Award.

==The four basic guilt groups==

Defined by Cathy Guisewite, the four basic guilt groups are four types of temptation that the character Cathy faces in her daily life.

===Food===
Cathy has a love/hate affair with food (especially carbs). She loves food, but suffers from body dysmorphia from her weight. She is often shown in a department store fitting room trying to stuff herself into a bathing suit. She is overweight, but not obese, and has some success with weight loss over the course of the comic. Cathy is particularly fond of chocolate, pizza, and her mother&#x27;s cooking.

===Love===
Cathy dates extensively, but is unable to find &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; She has a number of love interests throughout the comic, though none more consistent than Irving. Later in the series, they marry. At the end of the comic series, Irving and Cathy find out that they are expecting a child.
===Mom===
Although well-meaning, Mom&#x27;s advice often frustrates Cathy. Cathy is from the era of feminism, women&#x27;s rights, and the sexual revolution. Mom is from the earlier, more conservative World War II—1950s era. Although presented as an equal in her marriage to Cathy&#x27;s Dad, Mom holds many old-fashioned ideas. Prior to Cathy&#x27;s marriage, she seems to have an obsession with seeing Cathy married, keeping a current copy of &quot;Bride&quot; magazine in her purse and trying to send Christmas cards to Cathy&#x27;s ex-boyfriends.

===Work===
Cathy has to juggle many tasks at Product Testing, Inc. Her boss, Mr. Pinkley, often asks the impossible. Cathy always seems to pull through in the end and gives him and the client exactly what they want, albeit with quite a bit of drama.

==In popular culture==

===Comics===
The June 18, 2017 strip of the relaunched &quot;Bloom County&quot; featured a dismayed Cathy awakening in bed alongside Steve Dallas. She also appeared in the strip the following day.

The comic strip &quot;Luann&quot; featured Mabel (in the October 5, 2016 strip) as a worker of the &#x27;Bridal Barn&#x27; wedding gown store where Toni Daytona went to purchase her wedding gown with the help of Nancy and Luann DeGroot.

===Television===
A live action &quot;Cathy&quot; sketch was included in the special &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day Sunday Funnies&quot; broadcast May 8, 1983 on NBC.

&quot;Caroline in the City&quot; features fictional cartoonist Caroline Duffy (Lea Thompson), who makes a rival strip. The feud between Caroline and &quot;Cathy&quot; is described as &quot;oily rag, lit cigarette&quot;. In the season 1 episode &quot;Caroline and the Bad Back&quot;, Caroline hurts her back and is unable to meet a deadline. To prevent the newspapers from double running &quot;Cathy&quot; strips, Del (Eric Lutes) and Richard (Malcolm Gets) create one for Caroline. The strip is presented as being only funny to men. Upon seeing the strip, Caroline declares that: &quot;&quot;Cathy&quot; is gonna have a field day with this&quot;.

In &quot;Sex and the City&quot; season 3, &quot;Cock-a-doodle-doo&quot;, Miranda compares her lonely and repetitive take-out orders to a &quot;Cathy&quot; cartoon, and Carrie asks her never to refer to &quot;Cathy&quot; again, indicating Cathy&#x27;s status by 2000 as a symbol of an earlier generation&#x27;s sad, contemptuous view of single women. (Miranda: &quot;I&#x27;m sitting home with my cat, ordering the same thing almost every night. The only thing sadder would be a Cathy comic pasted on my refrigerator door.&quot; Carrie: &quot;Never say Cathy comic to me again&quot;). 

On the series &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Cathy&quot; has been referenced more than once. On the episode &quot;Don Geiss, America and Hope&quot;, Liz Lemon&#x27;s boyfriend Wesley compares her obsession with food to being like &quot;a Cathy cartoon that just won&#x27;t end&quot;. In another episode, Liz exclaims &quot;Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, aack!&quot;, which had been exclaimed by Cathy herself in an earlier strip.

On &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Andy Samberg would portray Cathy as loud and obnoxious on Weekend Update (Season 34, Episode 17; aired March 7, 2009).

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Sums&quot;, a painting of Cathy is shown as part of a hall of famous female artists; in the painting, Cathy is shown in a two-piece swimsuit, saying &quot;I&#x27;m finally able to fit into my bathing suit... and it&#x27;s September!&quot;. In a &quot;Simpsons&quot; comic strip, Comic Book Guy owns a rare &quot;Cathy&quot; cartoon - the only one that men find funny.

In the 2022 &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;May Cause Involuntary Political Discharge&quot;, Cathy falls in love with the Martian leader from &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; over their shared love of the word &quot;Ack!&quot;

In the 2010 &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Wheaton Recurrence&quot;, Sheldon brings Penny ice cream, citing that he had been familiarizing himself with the comic strip Cathy and that when she is upset, she says &quot;Ack!&quot; and eats ice cream.

=== Podcasts ===
In 2021, writer and comedian Jamie Loftus released &quot;Aack Cast,&quot; a podcast series tackling the history, impact, and continuing relevance of the comic strip.

<doc id="550305" wikidata="Q1255108" url="?curid=550305" title="Drill commands">
<text>Drill commands are generally used with a group that is marching, most often in military foot drills or in a marching band. Drill commands are usually heard in major events involving service personnel, reservists and veterans of a country&#x27;s armed forces, and by extension, public security services and youth uniformed organizations.

==Common drill commands==
=== Without weapons ===
*Fall in. Have designated troops move into formation on the parade square and/or ground.
*Fall out. Have designated troops to face the commander to be dismissed.
*Dismissed. Telling designated units to leave the parade square/ground. 
*Attention (United States: &quot;ten-hut&quot;). Have the soldiers adopt the at attention position.
*Stand fast. Individual soldiers remain at the attention position regardless of the movement of others in the formation.

==== Rest positions ====
*Stand at ease (United States: &quot;parade rest&quot;) has the soldiers in a more relaxed position.
*Stand easy (United States: &quot;at ease&quot;) has the soldiers adopt the next easiest stance, where hands are still clasped behind the back; however, the soldiers can relax their upper bodies (the shoulders can be slacked) and quietly speak. This is often, but not always, followed by an implicit &quot;relax&quot; (&quot;rest&quot;). This is typically used when being addressed or lectured for a long period of time where the positions of attention or at ease would be too painful or uncomfortable to hold.
*Relax (United States: &quot;rest&quot;): The only parade instruction given in an ordinary voice, rather than the raised, emphatic parade voice. This is the only position that actually offers soldiers freedom of movement. Soldiers are typically allowed to move other than moving their feet, though, when it is given by a high-ranking officer, soldiers typically move a minimal amount after a bit of stretching.

==== Dressing ====

*Right dress – all personnel except the right marker bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their shoulder is extremely close to the soldier&#x27;s hand on their right, unless otherwise specified. The American version of this is called &quot;dress right, dress&quot;.
*Left dress – all personnel except the left marker bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. After this, they pause, and then shuffle back to a new position, where their shoulder is extremely close to the soldier&#x27;s hand on their left, unless otherwise specified. The American version of this is called &quot;dress left, dress&quot;.
*Inwards dress/centre dress – used when a parade is formed up in two or more groups with colours, guidons, or banners on parade. This is used so that dressing is off the colours. The formations to the left of the colour party will dress to the right and the formations to the right of the colour party will dress to the left. All personnel to the right of the colours in front row and left column except the left marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their left arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing left. All personnel to the left of the colours in front row and right side column except the right marker take one step forward, pause, and only the front rank bring up their right arms parallel to the ground. At the same time, all members of the formation snap their heads so they are facing right.
*Eyes front (United States: &quot;ready front&quot;) – the front rank snaps their arms down and faces forward, while all other ranks simply face forward.

=== With weapons ===
==== Rifles ====

*Shoulder/slope arms: The rifle is brought on the left or right sides by the shoulder. 
*Change arms (Commonwealth only): When the rifle is being carried at the slope, trail or shoulder, it is changed from one side of the body to the other.
*Present arms: The soldiers bring their weapons to the front of their bodies, and adjust their right foot position. Soldiers without weapons use a salute appropriate for their headdress. In the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations, the command is often preceded with a general salute or royal/presidential/national salute, when appropriate. 
*Order arms: Servicemen carrying a weapon lower the butt of the weapon to the ground, muzzle vertical.
* Port arms: The weapon is brought out in front of the soldier, and held by the right hand on small of the butt, or equivalent, and the left hand about the forestock, or equivalent.
* High port arms: The weapon is brought out in front of the soldier in the form similar to Port Arms but higher so that the butt and forestock or equivalent is raised.
*For inspection, port arms (United States: &quot;inspection arms&quot;): The weapon are raised at the port position in order that it can be properly inspected.
*Reverse arms: The weapon is held reversed as a sign of mourning.
* Ground arms: Servicemen bring their rifles to the ground.
* Trail arms: Servicemen bring their grip from the pistol grip to the carrying handle of the rifle in order to carry the rifle horizontally
* Sling arms: If the soldiers have a &quot;sling&quot; (strap) on their rifles, then this command can be called. The soldiers will loosen the sling so they can now have their rifles strapped around their shoulders.
* Unsling arms: Servicemen will unloosen the sling so they can now have their rifles at the port or high port position.
* Front sling arms: Servicemen holding weapons with slings attached to the chest now sling those weapons in the Port or High Port Arms position.
*Fire of joy, load weapons: This command is used in parades such as the National Day Parade in Singapore, and trooping the colour. Soldiers will load the rifle with the blank round in preparation of the &quot;feu de joie&quot;, French for &quot;fire of joy&quot; in parades. In Polish this is called the &quot;Salwa Honorowa&quot; and in Hebrew it&#x27;s called &quot;ירי כבוד&quot;, or honor volley.
*Fix bayonets: In US ceremonies, whenever the bayonets are to be fixed to the weapons, this command is called out. In times, the accompanying bugle call for it is used before the order is done. The troops pull out their bayonets from their uniforms and attach them to the weapon.
*Unfix bayonets: Soldiers in formation remove their bayonets from their rifles and return them to their uniforms.
====Sabres====
*Draw sabres: used to draw the sabres.
*Return sabres: used to return the sabres.
*Present sabres: used for officers to salute using their sabres.
*Shoulder/slope sabres: used for officers to slope the sabre in their left-hand shoulder.
*Order sabres: the sabre is lowered to the ground after presenting or sloping.

=== Forming the parade for the march past/pass in review ===
*Pass in review – used in the US to denote the start of the march past segment of parades. When this command is said the parade prepares in readiness for the march past. It is also used as a way for newly assigned commanders to inspect the troops they command.

* Parade, in close order, left/right dress – in the UK, this command is used to commence dressing of parade units in close order

* Company, in close order, form three/four ranks – in the UK, this command is used to form companies into three or four ranks of personnel each

* Staff behind me, (forward) march – in the US, this command is used by the parade commander to form his parade staff in readiness for the march past/pass in review segment of parades

* Parade will now advance/retire in slow/quick time, about turn – in the Commonwealth the command is used to form parade formations when arranged in line formation for the march past

* Distance by a single lineman - in the former Soviet Union and in countries that were trained by the Soviet Armed Forces (except the Baltics) this ensures that the distance of the formations of parade (either of company or battalion size) be equal to those of the parade armed linemen that line the parade grounds or square for the march past

* Move to the right/left in twos/threes/fours - in the Commonwealth, this command is used for a company or companies to execute left/right turn forming either two, three or four ranks

=== Saluting on the march ===
In the Commonwealth countries, the following saluting on the march commands are ordered with a preparatory command of &quot;Saluting on the march...&quot;. For example, &quot;Saluting on the march, to the front salute&quot; and always called on the left foot.
*To the front salute or &quot;salute&quot;: The parade is halted and the right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. This is lowered and then repeated again, followed by an about turn and a resume in marching (off the left foot). The timing is: &quot;Call, check, halt, 2, 3, up, 2, 3, down, 2, 3, 4, 5, up, 2, 3, down, 2, 3, about, 2, 3, in, 2, 3, left, right, left.&quot; It is one of, if not the longest drill movement in the military.
In British corps, the drill movement for saluting to the front is the following. Two, three, up. Two, three, down.
*To the right salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of &quot;Up, two, three, four, five, down, swing!&quot;
:This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.
*To the left salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of &quot;Up, two, three, four, five, down, away!&quot;
:This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker (as they are the front most of the saluting flank), who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.

In the United States, the command for saluting on the march is &quot;Eyes, right/eyes left&quot;. The parade formation commander and other officers execute the hand salute or execute sabre salute if available (especially if full dress uniform is worn) (and if present on parade the company guidon bearers dip them in salute about 90 degrees above the ground), while everyone but the right file or left file in either case turns their heads to the right. The command for recovery is &quot;Ready, front.&quot; If the command does not have rifles, they will salute if given the command &quot;Present arms&quot;. The arms will be lowered back to their normal position on the commands &quot;Order arms&quot;. They can also salute if given the command &quot;Hand salute&quot;. The salute is raised when the parade leader finishes saying &quot;salute&quot;, and is lowered in after being held for the same amount of time elapsed between the words &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;salute.&quot;

=== Compliments on the march ===

*Eyes right: The parade turn their heads to the right after a check pace. The parade leader salutes while looking in the direction they gave.
:This is done while looking to the right, except the right marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.
*Eyes left: Similar to the &quot;eyes right&quot; except the parade looks to the left.
:This is done while looking to the left, except the left marker, who must stay looking to the front, to keep the flight, squad, platoon, etc. staying straight.

====Saluting at the halt (static)====
*To the front salute or salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of &quot;Up, two, three, down!&quot;
*To the right salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of &quot;Up, two, three, down!&quot; 
*To the left salute: The right arm is raised so the forearm is placed at a 90° angle, while pointing at the temple. It is generally to a count of &quot;Up, two, three, down!&quot;
In the United States, salutes at a halt are given on the command &quot;hand salute&quot;. They are lowered in the same amount of time elapsed between the two words. The command &quot;present arms&quot; will cause the command to salute if the command is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with the command &quot;order arms&quot;.
*Advance in review order, by the centre, quick march: This is used to pay final compliments to the reviewing officer. On this very command the unit being reviewed advances 15 paces and halts automatically before presenting arms to the reviewing officer. It is usually employed by the British Army and the Canadian Army, as well as by other Commonwealth armed forces.

===Colour commands===

====Marching with colours====
*Let fly the colours: The colours are normally held in a semi-taut position. This is a simple, ceremonial letting fly and catching of the colours.
*Slant colours: The colours are normally kept upright, but this can represent a problem both when dealing with standard doors. This slants the colours forward sufficiently to negate this, and they are brought back up afterward.
*Slope/shoulder colours: The normal method for carrying colours can be tiresome for the bearer. This has the colours taken out of their frogs and sloped over the right shoulder at about 45°.
* March on/off (retire) the colours - this vocal command by the parade commander orders the colour guard or massed colour guards either to get into position or prepare for departure in the parade square or ground during the ceremony
* Colour party, (by the) centre/right, (quick) march - the command given by the commander of the colour party for it to commence marching. A single colour is at the centre-front of the colour party and dressing is taken off it (by the centre). Where there are two or more colours in the colour party, the senior colour takes the right-front position and dressing is taken from it (by the right). If the colour party changes direction on the march, it does so in a way that the senior colour maintains the senior position.

====Colour commands at the halt (static)====
*Order colours: Essentially the same as order arms, except used exclusively for the colour party.
*Carry colours: This is equivalent to Shoulder Arms. The right arm lifts the colours up so they line up with the body&#x27;s centre line, with the right arm held in front of the soldier, at mouth level parallel to the ground. It is caught and guided into its frog with the left hand, which is then returned to its side.
*Change colours: This is used when the senior flag officer decides that he or she and the other flag holding members, have held their flags for a long time, and that their arms are tired, so, when the command &quot;Change - colours!&quot; is given, the flag holders put their arms in line with the flag, their other hand on top of their first hand and move the first hand down to attention, so that the other hand is now at the first hands&#x27; original position.

===Turning motions===

===Turning motions at the march===
*Right turn (U.S.:Column right, march): A 90° turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball. The cautionary and executive are both called on the left foot. The left leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground (although exceptions are made for kilted regiments) and slammed into the ground in the position of attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.
*Left turn (U.S.:Column left, march): A 90° turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel. The right leg is then brought up to be parallel to the ground and slammed down into attention. This motion is done at a particular fixed point.
*About turn (U.S.: To the rear, march): A 180° turn to the right, done as an exaggerated version of the right turn. United States units do not make exaggerated gestures with the legs or arms.
*Right flank march or right turn, it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching execute 90° turn to the right done by rotating on the right heel and left ball.
*Left flank march or left turn, it is still the same even on the march for some countries: All members marching 90° turn to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.
*Right incline (U.S.:Column half-right, march), is a half turn to the right, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45° to the right, done by rotation on the left ball and the right heel.
*Left incline (U.S.:Column half-left, march), is a half turn to the left, usually used when a flight, squad, platoon, etc. is not in its proper alignment. All members marching turn by 45° to the left, done by rotation on the right ball and the left heel.
*Right wheel, is a turn to the right, differentiated from a right turn in that the order of march remains the same. During a wheel, the rank that is wheeling should all look inwards, with the inside taking smaller paces, and the outside taking larger to remain dressed properly.
*Left wheel, is a mirror of the right wheel.

====Turning motions at the halt (static)====

United States Armed Forces:

*Right face: The body is rotated on the heel of the right foot and then the left heel is brought forward to meet the right heel in the position of attention.
*Left face: A mirror image of right face.
*About face: The right toe is brought back to behind the left heel; the body pivots on the right toe and left heel 180°.
*Half-left face: Exactly the same as a left face, but one turns only 45°.
*Half-right face: Exactly the same as a right face, but one turns only 45°.

Commonwealth of Nations

*Right turn: The body is rotated 90° to the right members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy, the heel movements mirror that of the US Armed Forces.
*Left turn: A mirror image of right turn.
*About turn: The body is rotated 180° in a clockwise direction, knees locked. Members shall bend the left knee, straighten it in double time and smartly place the left foot beside the right to assume the position of attention. In the Royal Navy heel movements are the same for right face.
*Right incline: Exactly the same as a right turn, but one turns only 45°.
*Left incline: Exactly the same as a left turn, but one turns only 45°.

===Marching motions===

*Quick march: The standard pace is typically 116 beats/minute with a 30in. step. There is also a &quot;rifleman&#x27;s pace&quot;, 140 beats per minute and a Highland pace, 110 beats per minute (typically done with a kilt.) The pace is based on the individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band&#x27;s rhythm. The way the march is performed depends on the regiment&#x27;s nationality.
*Slow march: This is a ceremonial pace, used for funerals and when a unit&#x27;s colours are marched out in front of the troops. The standard pace is 65 beats per minute.
*Half step march or cut the pace:
:*This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as quick time, but instead of 30 inches, the step is 15 inches.
:*There is also a Canadian and Commonwealth version of this, used for when the front file/rank is getting too far ahead of the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, it means that front file/rank should make their steps smaller, to allow for the rest of the flight, squad, or platoon, to get back into a proper dressing.
*Double march: This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of quick time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is &quot;Double time, march&quot;.
*Easy march: This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is &quot;Route step, march&quot;. In the Canadian Forces the command &quot;March at, ease&quot; is given while the unit is on the march. It can not be given from the halt.
*Mark time: This is essentially a stationary march with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off of the ground. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed. The U.S. equivalent command is &quot;Mark time, march&quot;.
*Step for -ward or forward or forward, march: This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march.

==Historical drill commands for parade==

===Musket drill===
The 18th-century musket, as typified by the brown Bess, was loaded and fired in the following way:

#Upon the command &quot;prime and load&quot; the soldier would bring the musket to the priming position, with the pan opened.
#Upon the command &quot;handle cartridge&quot; the soldier would draw a cartridge. Cartridges consisted of a spherical lead bullet wrapped in a paper cartridge which also held the gunpowder propellant. The bullet was separated from the powder charge by a twist in the paper.
#The soldier would then bite off the top of the cartridge (the end without the bullet) and hold it closed with the thumb and index finger.
#Upon the command &quot;prime&quot;. The soldier would pour a small pinch of the powder from the cartridge into the priming pan. He would then close the frizzen so that the priming powder was trapped.
#Upon the command &quot;bout&quot; (about) the butt of the musket was then dropped to the ground by the left foot with the trigger guard facing to the rear and the soldier having just poured the rest of the powder into the barrel. Once all of the powder was poured into the barrel, the soldier would have stuffed the paper and the ball into the barrel, the paper acted as wadding to keep the gunpowder in the barrel and also packed it down.
#Upon the command &quot;draw ramrods&quot; the soldier would draw his ramrod from below the barrel. First forcing it half out before seizing it backhanded in the middle, followed by drawing it entirely out, while simultaneously turning it to the front and placing it one inch into the barrel.
#Upon the command &quot;ram down the cartridge&quot; he would then use the ramrod to firmly ram the bullet, wadding, and powder down to the bottom followed by tamping it down with two quick strokes.
#Upon the command &quot;return ramrods&quot; the ramrod was then returned to its hoops under the barrel. Then the musket was returned to the shoulder arms position.
#Upon the command &quot;make ready&quot; the musket was brought to the recover position (held vertically in front of the body with the trigger guard facing forward) and the cock (hammer) was drawn back to the full-cock position.
#Upon the command &quot;P&#x27;sent&quot; (present) the musket was brought up to the firing position in anticipation of the command &quot;fire&quot;.

*Under battle conditions, many of these commands were combined for speed and efficiency. On the command &quot;prime and load&quot; troops would, without further order, carry out all movements up to and including &quot;make ready&quot;. Because of the size of the companies and the general noise of battle, these commands could be and were often communicated through specialized drum beatings.
*This process was drilled into troops until they could do it by instinct and feel. The main advantage of the British Redcoats was that they trained at this procedure almost every day. The standard for the British Army was the ability to load and fire three rounds per minute. A skilled unit of musketeers was often able to fire four rounds per minute.

===Cavalry drill===
Cavalry drill had the purpose of training cavalrymen and their horses to work together during a battle. It survives , albeit in a much-diminished form, in the modern sporting discipline of dressage. The movements sideways or at angles, the pirouettes, etc., were the movements needed for massed cavalrymen to form and reform and deploy. Of the proponents of classical dressage from which modern dressage evolved, probably the best known are the Lipizzaner Stallions of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s Musical Ride gives an inkling of what massed cavalry drill at speed would have looked like.

===Other drills===
Other tasks may be broken down into drills; for example, weapons maintenance in the British army used the rhythmic &quot;naming of parts&quot; as a memory aid in the teaching and learning of how to strip, clean, and reassemble the service rifle.

<doc id="550308" wikidata="Q600446" url="?curid=550308" title="Barnstar">
<text>A barnstar (or barn star, primitive star, or Pennsylvania star) is a painted object or image, often in the shape of a five-pointed star but occasionally in a circular &quot;wagon wheel&quot; style, used to decorate a barn in some parts of the United States. They have no structural purpose but may be considered lucky, akin to a horseshoe mounted over a doorway. They are especially common in Pennsylvania and frequently seen in German-American farming communities. They are also found in Canada, particularly in the province of Ontario.

==History==
Barnstars were meant to represent the mark of the builder but became more frequently used for aesthetic purposes and were added to the building after construction was complete. Enthusiasts have traced a number of wooden barnstars to individual builders in the Pennsylvania area, where numerous examples can still be seen.

Barnstars were used in the United States during the 18th century and as late as 1870 in Pennsylvania, where their popularity increased greatly following the Civil War. Their regular use preceded that time, however, and stars were commonplace on large buildings, particularly factories, in pre-war Richmond, Virginia.

Barnstars remain a popular form of decoration and design, and modern houses are sometimes decorated with simple, metal, five-pointed stars that the makers describe as &quot;barn-stars&quot;. They are often deliberately distressed or rusted, alluding to the traditional decoration.

==Other star-shaped plates==
On older buildings in the Pennsylvania Dutch area of the United States, it is still possible to find barnstar-like building adornments that are painted, rather than wooden or metal, known as hex signs. Strictly speaking, they are defined apart from barnstars and visually bear only passing resemblance, but the two are often confused and their names are even regarded as interchangeable. Some hex signs incorporate star shapes, while others may take the form of a rosette or contain pictures of birds and other animals.

The term barnstar has been applied to star-shaped anchor plates that are used for structural reinforcement, particularly on masonry buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries. These are made of cast iron and are used as anchor plates serving as the washers for tie rods. The anchor-rod-and-plate assembly serves to brace the masonry wall against tilting or lateral bowing.

== Internet &quot;barnstars&quot; ==

 Some Wiki-based communities give their users an award called a &quot;barnstar&quot; as a continuation of the &quot;barn raising&quot; metaphor. The practice originated on MeatballWiki and was adopted by Wikipedia in 2003. The image that is frequently used for this purpose is actually a photo of one of the structural anchor plates, not of a proper barnstar.

<doc id="550321" wikidata="Q942386" url="?curid=550321" title="Harlan F. Stone">
<text>Harlan Fiske Stone (October 11, 1872 – April 22, 1946) was an American attorney who served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1925 to 1941 and then as the 12th chief justice of the United States from 1941 until his death in 1946. He also served as the U.S. Attorney General from 1924 to 1925 under President Calvin Coolidge, with whom he had attended Amherst College as a young man. His most famous dictum was that &quot;Courts are not the only agency of government that must be assumed to have capacity to govern.&quot;

Raised in Western Massachusetts, Stone practiced law in New York City after graduating from Columbia Law School. He became the Dean of Columbia Law School and a partner with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. During World War I, he served on the U.S. Department of War&#x27;s Board of Inquiry, which evaluated the sincerity of conscientious objectors. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Stone as the Attorney General. Stone sought to reform the U.S. Department of Justice in the aftermath of several scandals that occurred during the administration of President Warren G. Harding. He also pursued several antitrust cases against large corporations.

In 1925, Coolidge nominated Stone to the Supreme Court to succeed retiring Associate Justice Joseph McKenna, and Stone won U.S. Senate confirmation with little opposition. On the Taft Court, Stone joined with Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis in calling for judicial restraint and deference to the legislative will. On the Hughes Court, Stone and Justices Brandeis and Benjamin N. Cardozo formed a liberal bloc called the Three Musketeers that generally voted to uphold the constitutionality of the New Deal. His majority opinions in &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot; (1941) and &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot; (1938) were influential in shaping standards of judicial scrutiny.

In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Stone to succeed the retiring Charles Evans Hughes as Chief Justice, and the Senate quickly confirmed Stone. The Stone Court presided over several cases during World War II, and Stone&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot; upheld the jurisdiction of a U.S. military tribunal over the trial of eight German saboteurs. His majority opinion in &quot;International Shoe Co. v. Washington&quot; (1945) was influential with regards to personal jurisdiction. Stone was the chief justice in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944), ruling the exclusion of Japanese Americans into internment camps as constitutional. Stone served as Chief Justice until his death in 1946. He had one of the shortest terms of any chief justice, and was the first chief justice not to have served in elected office.

==Early years==

Stone was born in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, on October 11, 1872, to Fred Lauson Stone and Ann Sophia (née Butler) Stone. When Stone was two years old, his family moved to Western Massachusetts where he grew up. He graduated from Amherst High School. His father wished him to become a scientific farmer, and Stone matriculated at the Massachusetts Agricultural College where he attended classes from 1888 to 1890 and was later expelled at the end of his second year for a scuffle with an instructor. He later enrolled at Amherst College where he graduated in 1894 Phi Beta Kappa.

From 1894 to 1895, he was the sub master of Newburyport High School in Massachusetts, from which he also taught physics and chemistry. From 1895 to 1896, he was an instructor in history at Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn.

==Legal career==
Stone attended Columbia Law School from 1895 to 1898, received an LL.B., and was admitted to the New York bar in 1898. Stone practiced law in New York City, initially as a member of the firm Satterlee, Canfield &amp; Stone, and later as a partner in what is now a white-shoe law firm, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. From 1899 to 1902 he lectured on law at Columbia Law School. He was a professor there from 1902 to 1905 and eventually served as the school&#x27;s dean from 1910 to 1923. He lived in the Colosseum, an apartment building near campus.

=== World War I ===
During World War I, Stone served for several months on a War Department Board of Inquiry, with Major Walter Kellogg of the U.S. Army Judge Advocate Corps and Judge Julian Mack, that reviewed the cases of 2,294 men whose requests for conscientious objector status had been denied by their draft boards. The Board was charged with determining the sincerity of each man&#x27;s principles, but often devoted only a few minutes to interrogation and rendering a decision. Stone was impatient with men who took advantage of the benefits of life in America – using postage stamps was his example – without accepting the burdens of citizenship. In a majority of cases, the Board&#x27;s subjects either relinquished their claims or were judged insincere. He later summarized his experience with little sympathy: &quot;The great mass of our citizens subordinated their individual conscience and their opinions to the good of the common cause&quot; while &quot;there was a residue whose peculiar beliefs ... refused to yield to the opinions of others or to force.&quot; Nevertheless, he recognized the courage required to persist as a conscientious objector: &quot;The Army was not a bed of roses for the conscientious objector; and the normal man who was not supported in his stand by profound moral conviction might well have chosen active duty at the front as the easier lot.&quot;

=== After the war ===
At the end of the war, he criticized Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer for his attempts to deport aliens based on administrative action without allowing for any judicial review of their cases. During this time Stone also defended free speech claims for professors and socialists. Columbia soon became a center of a new school of jurisprudence, legal realism. Legal realists rejected formalism and static legal rules; instead, they searched for the experiential and the role of human idiosyncrasy in the development of law. Although Dean Stone encouraged the realists, he was condemned by Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler as an intellectual conservative who had let legal education at Columbia fall &quot;into the ruts.&quot;

In 1923, disgusted by his conflict with Butler and bored with &quot;all the petty details of law school administration&quot; that he dubbed &quot;administrivia&quot;, Stone resigned the deanship and joined the prestigious Wall Street firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. He received a much higher salary and headed the firm&#x27;s litigation department, which had a large corporation and estate practice (including J.P. Morgan Jr.&#x27;s interests). In full‑time private practice for only a brief time, Stone was considered a &quot;hard‑working, solid sort of person, willing on occasion to champion the rights of mankind, but safe nevertheless.&quot;

===Attorney general===
On April 1, 1924, he was appointed United States Attorney General by his Amherst classmate President Calvin Coolidge, who felt Stone would be perceived by the public as beyond reproach to oversee investigations into various scandals arising under the Harding administration. These scandals had besmirched Harding&#x27;s Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty, and forced his resignation. In one of his first acts as Attorney General, Stone fired Daugherty&#x27;s cronies in the Department of Justice and replaced them with men of integrity. As Attorney General, he was responsible for the appointment of J. Edgar Hoover as head of the Department of Justice&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation, which later became the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and directed him to remodel the agency so it would resemble Britain&#x27;s Scotland Yard and become far more efficient than any other police organization in the country. A pro‑active Attorney General, Stone argued many of his department&#x27;s cases in the federal courts and launched an anti‑trust investigation of the Aluminum Company of America, controlled by the family of fellow cabinet member Andrew Mellon, Coolidge&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury.

In the 1924 presidential election, Stone campaigned for Coolidge&#x27;s re‑election. He especially opposed the left-wing Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate, Robert M. La Follette, who had proposed that Congress be empowered to reenact any legislation that had been struck down by the Supreme Court. Stone found this idea threatening to the integrity of the judiciary as well as the separation of powers.

==U.S. Supreme Court==
===Associate Justice===
Shortly after the election, Justice Joseph McKenna retired from the Supreme Court, and on January 5, 1925, Coolidge nominated Stone to replace McKenna as an associate justice. His nomination was greeted with general approval, although there were rumors that Stone might have been kicked upstairs because of his antitrust activities. Some Senators raised questions about Stone&#x27;s connection to Wall Street making him a tool of corporate interests. To quiet those fears, Stone proposed that he answer questions of the Senate Judiciary Committee in person. After holding one closed door hearing on January 12, 1925, where they heard testimony from Willard Saulsbury Jr., the committee gave Stone&#x27;s nomination a favorable recommendation on January 21, 1925. The nomination was returned by the Senate to committee a few days later, and Stone became the first Supreme Court nominee to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on their nomination on January 28, 1925. On February 2, 1925, the committee again gave his nomination a favorable recommendation. Stone was confirmed by the Senate on February 5, 1925, by a vote of 71–6, and received his commission the same day. On March 2, 1925, Stone, who would ultimately be Coolidge&#x27;s only Supreme Court appointment, took the oath as an associate justice administered by Chief Justice William Howard Taft.

The Supreme Court of the mid‑1920s was primarily concerned with the relationships of business and government. A majority of the justices led by Taft were staunch defenders of business and capitalism free from most government regulation. The Court utilized the doctrines of substantive due process and the fundamental right of &quot;liberty of contract&quot; to oversee attempts at regulation by the national and state governments. Critics of the Court charged that the judiciary had usurped legislative authority and had embodied a particular economic theory, &quot;laissez faire&quot;, into its decisions. Despite the fears of progressives, Stone quickly joined the Court&#x27;s &quot;liberal faction&quot;, frequently dissenting with Justices Holmes and Brandeis and later, Cardozo when he took Holmes&#x27; seat, from the majority&#x27;s narrow view of the police powers of the state. The &quot;liberal&quot; justices called for judicial restraint, or deference to the legislative will.

During the 1932 to 1937 Supreme Court terms, Stone and his colleagues Justices Brandeis and Cardozo were considered the Three Musketeers of the Supreme Court, its liberal or Democratic-aligned faction. The three were highly supportive of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal agenda, which many other Supreme Court Justices opposed. For example, he wrote for the court in &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot;, , which upheld challenged provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Stone also authored the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot;, , which, in its famous &quot;Footnote 4&quot;, may have provided a roadmap for tiered scrutiny in the post-&quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; era.

===Chief Justice===

Stone&#x27;s support of the New Deal brought him Roosevelt&#x27;s favor, and on June 12, 1941, President Roosevelt nominated Stone to become chief justice, a position vacated by Charles Evans Hughes. Stone was Hughes’ personal choice for a successor. After it held a single hearing on Stone&#x27;s nomination on June 21, 1941, the Senate Judiciary Committee gave his nomination a favorable recommendation on June 23, 1941. Stone was confirmed by a voice vote in the Senate on June 27, 1941, and received his commission on July 3, 1941. He remained in this position for the rest of his life.
As chief justice, Stone spoke for the Court in upholding the President&#x27;s power to try Nazi saboteurs captured on American soil by military tribunals in &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;, . The Court&#x27;s handling of this case has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy.

Stone also wrote one of the major opinions in establishing the standard for state courts to have personal jurisdiction over litigants in &quot;International Shoe Co. v. Washington&quot;, .

As chief justice, Stone described the Nuremberg court as &quot;a fraud&quot; on Germans, even though his colleague and successor as associate justice, Robert H. Jackson, served as the chief U.S. prosecutor.

Stone was the fourth chief justice to have previously served as an Associate Justice and the second to have served in both positions consecutively. To date, Justice Stone is the only justice to have occupied all nine seniority positions on the bench, having moved from most junior associate justice to most senior associate justice and then to chief justice.

Stone was suddenly stricken while in an open session of the Supreme Court. He had just (or by some accounts not quite) finished reading aloud his dissent in &quot;Girouard v. United States&quot;. Justice Hugo Black called the Court into a brief recess, and physicians were called.

== Death ==
Stone died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 22, 1946, at his Washington D.C. home.

=== Burial ===
Stone is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery in the Petworth neighborhood of Washington, D.C. His grave is near those of other justices, including Justice Willis Van Devanter, Justice John Marshall Harlan, and Justice Stephen Johnson Field.

==Other activities and legacy==
Stone was a director of the &quot;Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line Railroad Company&quot;, president of the Association of American Law Schools, a member of the American Bar Association, and a member of the Literary Society of Washington for 11 years.

Stone was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Amherst College in 1900, and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Amherst in 1913. Yale awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1924. Columbia and Williams each awarded him the same honorary degree in 1925.
