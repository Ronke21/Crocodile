<text>Justas Paleckis ( – 26 January 1980) was a Lithuanian Soviet author, journalist and politician. He was nominal acting president of Lithuania after the Soviet invasion while Lithuania was still ostensibly independent, in office from 17 June to 3 August 1940. He then remained the head of state of the Lithuanian SSR until 1967.

==Life and career==
Paleckis was born in Telšiai in 1899 in to the family of a blacksmith of noble origin. In 1926–1927, he was a director of the Lithuanian official news agency, ELTA. He later voiced opposition to the ruling elite in Lithuania; in this way, he became a suitable candidate for the Lithuanian communists (subordinate to Soviet envoy Vladimir Dekanozov) to become the leader of Lithuania in the Soviets&#x27; planned takeover of the country in 1940. Paleckis had connections to the Lithuanian Communist Party from the early 1930s.

After President Antanas Smetona fled to the US when the Soviet Union occupied the country, Prime Minister Antanas Merkys became acting president. A day after Smetona left the country, Merkys announced he had formally ousted Smetona and taken over the presidency himself. He then appointed Paleckis prime minister. Merkys himself resigned, making Paleckis acting president as well. These moves are now considered illegal and unconstitutional, since Smetona never resigned. As such, Lithuanian government records do not recognize Paleckis as a legitimate president.

By this time, Lithuania had been occupied by Soviet troops. Paleckis&#x27; appointment as Prime Minister was made under orders from the Soviet embassy in Kaunas. Aided by specialists sent in from Moscow, Soviet deputy foreign minister Vladimir Dekanozov worked through the Lithuanian Communist Party, while the cabinet of ministers, headed by Paleckis, served an administrative function. Dekanozov and Paleckis brought a number of non-Communists into the first &quot;People&#x27;s government&quot;.

In order to save face, the Soviet Union attempted to cover its annexation of the Baltic States with a cloak of legality. Therefore, Moscow ordered the Paleckis government to carry out elections for a &quot;People&#x27;s Seimas&quot; on 14–15 July. Voters were presented with a single list of candidates containing only Communists and their allies. When the People&#x27;s Seimas met on 21 July, it had only one order of business—a resolution declaring Lithuania a Soviet republic and requesting admission to the Soviet Union, which was unanimously carried. A few days later, Moscow &quot;accepted&quot; the request—thus giving credence to the official line that Lithuania had carried out a socialist revolution independent of Moscow&#x27;s influence and requested admission to the Soviet Union. Since regaining independence in 1990, Lithuania has maintained that since Smetona never resigned, Merkys and Paleckis had no legitimate claim to the presidency, rendering all acts leading up to the Soviet annexation &quot;ipso facto&quot; void.

Paleckis remained as head of state, a post which was named Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, until 1967. However, the real power now lay with local Communist Party boss Antanas Sniečkus. As a head of state, Paleckis personally signed orders authorizing the mass deportation of several figures from independent Lithuania. With his agreement, Merkys and Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys were deported to the Russian SFSR. The intelligentsia and Lithuania&#x27;s elite were considered as enemies and were among the first sentenced to deportation or death. He worked closely with NKVD residents in Lithuania (M. Gedvilas, M. Mickis). Paleckis signed documents and, as a representative of Soviet Russia, took responsibility for the deportations.

During 1940–1953, some 132,000 Lithuanians were deported to remote areas of the USSR: Siberia, the Arctic Circle zone and Central Asia. More than 70% of the deportees were women and children. During the same period, another 200,000 people were imprisoned. Some 150,000 of them were sent to the Gulags, situated mostly in Siberia. 

He served as Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities from 1966 to 1970.

His son Justas Vincas Paleckis is a politician and Member of the European Parliament and an active politician.

Paleckis was also awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour of the Soviet Union.

<text>Richard Bassett (April 2, 1745 – September 15, 1815) was an American politician, attorney, slave owner and later abolitionist, veteran of the American Revolution, signer of the United States Constitution, and one of the Founding Fathers of America. He also served as United States Senator from Delaware, chief justice of the Delaware Court of Common Pleas, governor of Delaware and a United States circuit judge of the United States Circuit Court for the Third Circuit.

==Education and career==

Born on April 2, 1745, in Cecil County, Province of Maryland, British America, Bassett pursued preparatory studies, then read law. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Delaware. By concentrating on agricultural pursuits as well as religious and charitable concerns, he quickly established himself amongst the local gentry and &quot;developed a reputation for hospitality and philanthropy.&quot; He was a member of the Delaware constitutional conventions of 1776 and 1792. He was a member of the Council of Safety in Dover, Delaware from 1776 to 1786. He served in the Delaware State Militia as a company captain of the Dover Light Horse Regiment from 1777 to 1781. He was a member of the Delaware Legislative Council (now the Delaware Senate) in 1782. He was a member of the Delaware House of Representatives in 1786. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and was a signer of the United States Constitution. He was a member of the Delaware convention which ratified the United States Constitution in 1787. He was in private practice in Wilmington, Delaware from 1787 to 1789.

Bassett was elected to the United States Senate from Delaware and served from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1793, first as a member of the Anti-Administration Party and later as a member of the Pro-Administration Party. Due to his name coming first alphabetically out of all 20 senators who commenced their first term on 4 March, 1789, Bassett is the most senior senator to have served in the United States Senate. Bassett was chief justice of the Delaware Court of Common Pleas from 1793 to 1799. He was governor of Delaware from 1799 to 1801.

Bassett was nominated by President John Adams on February 18, 1801, to the United States Circuit Court for the Third Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 2 Stat. 89. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 20, 1801, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on July 1, 1802, due to abolition of the court.

==Later life and death==
After leaving the federal bench, Bassett became a planter in Cecil County.

While he was a slave owner, after converting to Methodism in the 1780s, he freed his slaves and campaigned for the state of Delaware to abolish slavery.

He died on September 15, 1815, on his estate &quot;Bohemia Manor&quot; in Cecil County. He was initially interred in Cecil County, and in 1865 his remains were re-interred in Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware.

==Legacy==

Bassett was the grandfather of Richard H. Bayard and James A. Bayard Jr., both United States senators from Delaware.

Bassett Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in Bassett&#x27;s honor.

Bassettown, now Washington, Pennsylvania, was named in Bassett&#x27;s honor by his cousin David Hoge.

<text>William Few Jr. (June 8, 1748 – July 16, 1828) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, politician and jurist. He represented the U.S. state of Georgia at the Constitutional Convention and signed the U.S. Constitution. Few and James Gunn were the first U.S. Senators from Georgia.

Born into a poor yeoman farming family, Few achieved both social prominence and political power later in life. Exhibiting those characteristics of self-reliance vital for survival on the American frontier, he became an intimate member of the nation&#x27;s political and military elite. The idea of a rude frontiersman providing the democratic leaven within an association of the rich and powerful has always excited the American imagination, nurtured on stories of Davy Crockett. In the case of the self-educated Few, that image was largely accurate.

Few&#x27;s inherent gifts for leadership and organization, as well as his sense of public service, were brought out by his experience in the American Revolutionary War. Important in any theater of military operations, leadership and organizational ability were particularly needed in the campaigns in the south where a dangerous and protracted struggle against British forces ultimately played a crucial role in the American victory. Few&#x27;s dedication to the common good and his natural military acumen quickly brought him to the attention of the leaders of the Patriot cause, who eventually invested him with important political responsibilities as well.

The war profoundly affected Few&#x27;s attitude toward the political future of the new nation, transforming the rugged frontier individualist into a forceful exponent of a permanent union of the states. Men of his stripe came to realize during the years of military conflict that the rights of the individual, so jealously prized on the frontier, could be nurtured and protected only by a strong central government accountable to the people. This belief became the hallmark of his long public service.

== Early history ==
Descendant of Quaker shoe polisher Richard Few from the county of Wiltshire, England, and his son Isaac Few, a cooper who emigrated to Pennsylvania in the 1640s, the Few family lived in northern Maryland, where they eked out a modest living raising tobacco on small holdings. When a series of droughts struck the region in the 1750s, the Fews and their neighbors—actually a sort of extended family consisting of cousins and distant relations—found themselves on the brink of ruin. The whole community decided to abandon its farms and try its luck among the more fertile lands on the southern frontier.

In time the Few family achieved a measure of prosperity, emerging as political leaders in rural Orange County. Like many other western settlers, however, the family became involved with the Regulators, a populist movement that grew up in reaction to the political and economic restrictions imposed on the frontier or back-country farmers by the merchants and planters of the tidewater area and by the local politicians and lawyers. By 1771 protest had become confrontation, and a large group of mostly unarmed westerners gathered to clash with North Carolina militia units at the Battle of Alamance. The uneven fight ended in total victory for the militia, although most of the Regulator&#x27;s demands for political representation and economic relief eventually would be met by the state legislature. More immediately, Few&#x27;s brother James was hanged for his part in the uprising, and the Few family farm just east of Hillsborough was ransacked by William Tryon&#x27;s militia troops. This led to Few&#x27;s ambivalence towards capital punishment. The rest of the family fled to Wrightsboro, Georgia, leaving Few behind to settle the family&#x27;s affairs and sell their property.

These antagonisms within North Carolina began to evaporate as American opinion turned against the imperial measures instituted by Great Britain in the 1770s. Both the eastern planters and the new settlers found new taxes and restrictions on western expansion at odds with their idea of self-government, and Patriot leaders were able to unite the state against what they could portray as a threat to the liberties of all parties.

Few participated in this training as one of the first men to enlist in the volunteer militia or &quot;minute men&quot; company formed in Hillsborough. Typically, Few&#x27;s unit received its tactical instruction from a veteran of the French and Indian Wars, in this case a former British Army corporal who was hired by the company as its drill sergeant. Citing the press of family business, Few rejected the offer of a captaincy in one of the first units North Carolina raised for the Continental Army in the summer of 1775. But when he finally settled the family&#x27;s accounts the next year and joined his relatives in Georgia, where he opened a law office, he quickly placed his newly acquired military knowledge at the service of the Patriot cause in his new state.

== Revolutionary War ==
Georgia organized its citizen-soldiers on a geographical basis, forming local companies into a regiment in each county. Few joined the Richmond County Regiment, which his older brother Benjamin commanded. For the next two years, Few&#x27;s military duties consisted of attending military assemblies where he instructed his friends and neighbors in the skills he had acquired in the North Carolina militia. Few was called to active duty in 1778, when Georgia was faced the threat of invasion by British and Loyalist troops based in Florida.

The Georgians&#x27; first military campaign ended in disaster. A force of state and Continental Army units successfully combined to repulse a British raid on Sunbury near the states southeastern border, but an American counterattack orchestrated by Major-General Robert Howe and Governor John Houstoun bogged down before they could reach St. Augustine, Florida. Few, in command of a company of Georgia Militia, watched the collapse of the campaign&#x27;s logistical support and then the disintegration of the American invaders, as senior officers bickered among themselves and as disease began to decimate the units. Only half of the American soldiers of the campaign survived to return home. At the end of the year a sudden amphibious invasion by British forces resulted in the capture of Savannah, Georgia, and the annihilation of the rest of the Continental Army troops under Howe&#x27;s command and most of the eastern militia units. Armed resistance to the British continued in the western part of the state, led by the Richmond County Regiment. Throughout 1779 the regiment, with Few as second in command, frequently turned out to skirmish with probing British units, eventually forcing them to abandon Augusta, which the British had captured soon after the fall of Savannah.

American successes began to reverse the fortunes of war in Georgia, prompting the recently appointed Continental Army commander in the region, Major General Benjamin Lincoln, to take the offensive. Lincoln combined his continentals and militia units from Georgia and South Carolina with French forces that had arrived from the Caribbean to lay siege to Savannah. He immediately encountered difficulty, however, in coordinating the efforts of his diverse forces. The French, under pressure to terminate operations quickly in order to move on to other assignments, persuaded Lincoln to launch a full frontal attack against the British. The result was a bloody defeat for the Franco-American attackers, but Few&#x27;s militiamen participated in a successful rear-guard action that shielded the retreat of the American units. In the aftermath of the battle his regiment was posted to the frontier where the Muscogee, interpreting the defeat before Savannah as proof of the Georgians&#x27; weakness, had attacked the Americans in concert with British forces.

British operations in Georgia in 1779 were part of a new &quot;southern strategy&quot; by which they planned to use the state as a base for conquering the rebellious colonies in a sweep up from the south. Few&#x27;s military service in the later years of the war proved critical both in frustrating this strategy and in enhancing his credentials as a state leader. The western forces, in which Few&#x27;s regiment played a prominent role, kept the British from consolidating their position. The area never developed into a secure Loyalist base, and British troops needed for subsequent operations in the Carolinas and Virginia had to be diverted to counter the threat posed by the American militiamen on the frontier. Few emerged as a gifted administrator and logistics expert in this demanding and difficult effort to maintain a viable military force in Georgia. He also turned into a bold, innovative partisan commander. Experience and innate common sense enabled him to develop patience, preserve his forces for key attacks, and then pick his time and place to engage small enemy parties without unduly risking the safety of his men. Most importantly, he displayed the raw physical stamina required to survive the serious hardships of guerrilla warfare.

== Statesman ==

Military was a success that went hand in hand with political service. During the late 1770s Few won election to the House of Representatives in the Georgia General Assembly, sat on the state&#x27;s Executive Council, acted as state surveyor-general, represented Georgia in negotiations with the Indians that succeeded in minimizing the danger of frontier attacks, and served as Richmond County&#x27;s senior magistrate. Few&#x27;s growing political prominence and undisputed talent for leadership prompted the state legislature in 1780 to appoint him to represent Georgia in the Continental Congress, which became the Congress of the Confederation after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation a year later.

Few served in Congress less than a year when, in the wake of General Nathanael Greene&#x27;s successful effort to drive the British out of most of Georgia, Congress sent him home to help reassemble Georgia&#x27;s scattered government. This task accomplished, Few returned to Congress in 1782, where he remained to serve throughout most of the decade. While a member of that body, Few was asked by his state to serve concurrently in the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787. This dual responsibility caused him to split his time between the two bodies and therefore to miss portions of the constitutional proceedings. Nevertheless, Few firmly supported the effort to create a strong national government and worked hard to secure the Continental Congress&#x27; approval of the new instrument of government. He also participated in the Georgia convention in 1788 that ratified the document.

Georgia promptly selected Few to serve as one of its original United States senators. In the Senate, Few opposed the creation of the First Bank of the United States. Planning to retire from politics at the expiration of his term in 1793, he bowed instead to the wishes of his neighbors and served yet another term in the state legislature. In 1796, Few was appointed as a federal judge for the Georgia circuit. During this three-year appointment, he consolidated his reputation as a practical, fair jurist and became a prominent supporter of public education. He was a founding trustee of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens in 1785. Few&#x27;s efforts to establish UGA as the first state-chartered university in the United States indicated the importance this self-educated man gave to formal instruction.

He was an outspoken opponent of the infamous Yazoo land scandal, though his political enemies tried to implicate him in this scam.

At the urging of his wife, a native New Yorker, Few left Georgia in 1799 and moved to Manhattan. There, he embarked on yet another career of public service, while supporting his family through banking and the occasional practice of law. He served as president of the City Bank of New York, the predecessor of present-day Citigroup, after Samuel Osgood died in August 1813. He stayed in this position until 1817, when Peter Stagg became president. Few&#x27;s new neighbors promptly elected him to represent them in the New York State Assembly from 1802 to 1805 and later as a city alderman from 1813 to 1814. He also served as New York&#x27;s inspector of prisons from 1802 to 1810 and as the United States Commissioner of Loans in 1804. Few retired in 1815 to his country home in Fishkill, New York, in Dutchess County where he died on July 16, 1828.

== Death and legacy ==

Few died at age 80 in 1828 in Fishkill-on-Hudson (present day Beacon, New York), survived by his wife Catherine Nicholson (daughter of Commodore James Nicholson) and three daughters. He addressed his memoirs to his daughter, Frances. He was buried in the yard of the Reformed Dutch Church of Fishkill Landing. In 1973, at the request of the state of Georgia, his remains were removed and reinterred at Saint Paul&#x27;s Church in Augusta, Georgia.

James Marshall said of William Few, &quot;He was one of those men, &#x27;few and far between,&#x27; who effect more by solid weight of character than many can by eloquent speech or restless action.&quot; Few Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named in Few&#x27;s honor and the William Few Parkway was constructed near his Augusta homestead in Columbia County, Georgia.

<text>Phillip Anthony Barresi (; born 8 August 1955) is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2007, representing the Victorian seat of Deakin for the Liberal Party. Prior to entering politics he was a registered psychologist and worked in human resources and industrial relations.

==Early life==
Barresi was born on 8 August 1955 in Patti, Sicily, Italy. He spent his earliest years in the town of Falcone, arriving in Australia in 1960. He holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the Australian National University and a graduate diploma in applied social psychology from Swinburne Institute of Technology.

Barresi became a registered psychologist. Before entering politics he worked as a training officer with Victorian Railways, as a human resources and industrial relations manager, and as a consultant.

==Politics==
Barresi served as president of the Liberal Party&#x27;s Boroondara branch from 1992 to 1995. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1996 federal election, retaining the Division of Deakin for the Liberals. In his maiden speech he acknowledged that he was the first Italian-born Coalition MP.

Barresi was a member of the speaker&#x27;s panel in 2004 and again from 2006 to 2007. He was also chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation from 2004 to 2007. He was a prominent supporter of the Howard government&#x27;s WorkChoices legislation.

At the 2007 election, Barresi was defeated by Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate Mike Symon. He reprised his candidacy against Symon at the 2010 election but was again defeated.

==Later life==

<doc id="559132" wikidata="Q4977100" url="?curid=559132" title="Bruce Baird">
<text>Bruce George Baird, AM (born 28 February 1942), is an Australian former politician whose career included a stint as Deputy Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party and as a Member of the Australian House of Representatives for Cook.

==Early life==
Baird grew up in Cronulla, where his father owned the local shoe store. He was educated at Winston College, Cronulla Public School and Sutherland Intermediate High School, before studying for a Bachelor of Arts at University of Sydney. He later studied at University of Melbourne, holding a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from the latter. He was Assistant Trade Commissioner at the Australian Embassy in Bonn, Germany, from 1972–1976, then Trade Commissioner at the Australian Consulate-General in New York, 1977–1980. He was Government Affairs Manager for Esso Australia 1980–1984.

==Political career==

Baird was elected as member for the electorate of Northcott in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1984. He was appointed as Shadow Minister for Transport and Finance in May 1986. Following the election of the Greiner Government in 1988, he was appointed as Minister for Transport. He was later appointed as Minister for Sydney&#x27;s Olympic Bid 1990–1993.. Baird made an attempt to become Premier when he was a candidate to succeed Nick Greiner in 1992, but lost out to John Fahey. He was also deputy leader of the Liberal Party from 1992 to 1994 and served as Minister for Tourism from 1992 to 1993 and as Minister for Roads from 1993 to 1995.

===Federal politics===
Baird was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to November 2007, representing the electorate of Cook, New South Wales. He also held the positions of chairman of the National Rail Corporation, and was a board member of ABN Amro Hoare Govett, Tourism Training Australia and Tourism Education Services. Baird along with fellow Liberal MPs Petro Georgiou, Russell Broadbent and Judi Moylan opposed mandatory detention of asylum seekers.

Despite being a former deputy leader of the NSW Liberal Party, Baird never served as a minister during his time in Federal Parliament. Baird had been overlooked for ministerial preferment by Prime Minister John Howard because he was a supporter of deputy Liberal leader and Howard&#x27;s heir apparent Peter Costello.

Another factor that precluded Baird&#x27;s promotion by Howard was that Baird&#x27;s preselection for Cook prior to the 1998 election came against Howard&#x27;s wishes as Howard had supported the previous Liberal member and preselected candidate for Cook, Stephen Mutch.

Sensing that he would not be promoted by Howard, Baird in 2004 sought to become Speaker but was unsuccessful with David Hawker chosen as the Government&#x27;s candidate for Speaker instead.

In April 2007, he announced that he would retire at the next election. A fierce battle over his successor ensued; Michael Towke was initially preselected as the Liberal candidate 86 votes to 8 but was the target of several negative news reports, before being replaced with Scott Morrison, who went on to win the seat.

==After politics==
Baird was appointed Chairman of the Tourism and Transport Forum, a peak industry lobby group, in 2008. In the same year, he was also appointed as chair of the Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council, which advises the Australian government on resettling refugees in Australia.

Following the financial collapse of a number of private providers of education to international students, in 2009 Baird agreed to head up a review into international education in Australia. Baird delivered the report in a joint press conference in March 2010. Included in his recommendations were tighter regulation including stronger entry requirements, improved risk assessment, and where breaches occur, tougher penalties.

In 2010 on Australia Day, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to the Parliament of Australia, and to the community of New South Wales through a range of business, tourism and welfare organisations. In August 2017, Business Events Sydney announced the appointment of Baird as their new Chairman, commencing from 1 September 2017.

== Personal life ==
Bruce and Judy Baird&#x27;s children are Steve Baird, Chief Executive Officer International Justice Mission Australia; Julia Baird, columnist with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and host of the ABC News program &quot;The Drum&quot;; and Mike Baird, now Chief Executive Officer of HammondCare, and previously the Premier of New South Wales from 2014 to 2017.

He is a patron of the Asylum Seekers Centre, a not-for-profit that provides personal and practical support to people seeking asylum in Australia.

<doc id="559133" wikidata="Q4931731" url="?curid=559133" title="Bob Baldwin (politician)">
<text>Robert Charles Baldwin (born 9 March 1955) is a former Australian politician who was a member of the Australian House of Representatives for Paterson in New South Wales from March 1996 to October 1998 and again from November 2001 until May 2016, representing the Liberal Party. Baldwin served in the Abbott Ministry as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry from September 2013 to December 2014; and as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment from December 2014 to September 2015.

==Background and early years==
Baldwin was born in Gloucester, England. At the age of three, he moved with his family to Australia, arriving at the Villawood migrant camp in Sydney. His family were not well off, with Baldwin in his final parliamentary speech reflecting on the fact &quot;I would have been happy to sit on a fruit box with a clipboard as my desk, such is the honour to be the 889th person ever elected to the House of Representatives in just on 95 years.&quot;. Baldwin was a company director before entering politics. He gained Australian citizenship as a child, and renounced his British citizenship prior to standing for Parliament.

==Political career==
He held the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources from January 2006 until December 2007 when the Australian Labor Party was elected to govern Australia. After the election, on 6 December 2007 Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson announced that Baldwin would be the new Shadow Minister for Defence Science, Personnel and Assisting Shadow Minister for Defence. On 16 April 2008 he represented the Federal Opposition leader, Brendan Nelson at the commemoration service for HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran personnel who lost their lives on 19 November 1941.

After Malcolm Turnbull became leader, he remained in his job. When the 2009 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election was held and Tony Abbott replaced Turnbull he kept his roles. On 14 September 2010 after the 2010 federal election he was promoted to Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Shadow Minister for Tourism.

Baldwin was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry in the Abbott Ministry on 18 September 2013; and appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment on 23 December 2014. He was not appointed to a position in the First Turnbull Ministry from September 2015.

On 16 April 2016, Baldwin announced he would be retiring from politics and would not contest the 2016 federal election. This came after a redistribution erased his majority in Paterson. He had previously enjoyed a majority of nine percent, but the reconfigured Paterson had a notional thin Labor majority of 0.3 percent. Labor went on to take the seat on a large swing.

<text>Kerry Joseph Bartlett (born 15 April 1949) is an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives between March 1996 and November 2007, representing the Division of Macquarie, New South Wales. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and was educated at the University of Sydney and Macquarie University, and has a master&#x27;s degree in economics from the latter. Before entering politics, he was a school economics and history teacher at Wycliffe Christian School, a university economics tutor and a financial planner.

Bartlett did not attain a ministry but was Chief Government Whip from 2004 until 2007. His seat was radically altered ahead of the 2007 election. He&#x27;d previously held the seat with a fairly safe majority of eight percent, but a redistribution wiped out Bartlett&#x27;s majority and turned Macquarie into a marginal Labor seat. He was defeated by former Labor state minister Bob Debus on a swing of six percent.

<text>Bruce Fredrick Billson (born 26 January 1966) is an Australian former politician. A member of the Liberal Party, he was a member of the House of Representatives for Dunkley, a Melbourne seat, from 1996 to 2016 and held ministerial office in the Howard, Abbott and Turnbull governments as Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs (2007) and Minister for Small Business (2013–2015).

Billson is a founding Director of Judo Bank and has held various board appointments, including the Franchise Council of Australia, the Institute of Public Accountants/Deakin University SME Research Centre and Australian Property Institute. He was the director-small business and enterprise at Deakin University Business School and has also owned and operated several small businesses. He was appointed as the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman in 2021.

==Early life and education==
Billson was born in Albury, New South Wales, and moved to Seaford, Victoria as a child. He was educated at Monterey High School in Frankston North and has a Master of Business Leadership, Graduate Diploma of Business Management and Bachelor of Business Degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University. He is a Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors company directors course.

He was Acting Chief Executive and Manager of Corporate Development for the Shire of Hastings, a ministerial adviser to the Victorian Minister for Natural Resources, and policy adviser to the Shadow Minister for the Environment, Senator Rod Kemp, before entering politics.

==Career==

===Ministerial roles===

Billson was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2004. In 2005, he was also appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and in 2006, he was promoted to Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs/Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence – positions he retained until the defeat of the Howard government in the 2007 federal election.

In 2007, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. In 2009, he was then appointed the Shadow Minister for Sustainable Development and Cities and after the 2010 election he was appointed Shadow Minister for Small Business, Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs.

Following the 2013 election he was sworn into the cabinet as the Minister for Small Business (including responsibility for competition policy and consumer affairs).

===Retirement from politics===
Following the leadership spill that saw Malcolm Turnbull become Prime Minister, Billson was dropped from the new Ministry upon the ascension of the Turnbull government. On 24 November 2015, he announced he would retire from politics at the 2016 federal election. On 22 March 2016, it was announced that he would serve as the executive chairman of the Franchise Council of Australia (FCA).

In August 2017, Billson admitted he had received a salary from the FCA several months before his retirement, which he had not declared on the register of members&#x27; interests. Billson apologised to the Clerk of the House for the omission, but claimed his directorship was not concealed and there was no conflict of interest.

He was cleared of breaching ministerial guidelines by the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, who found there was “no reason to conclude Mr Billson has breached either the Statement of Ministerial Standards or the Lobbying Code of Conduct”. The issue was also referred to an inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives&#x27; Standing Committee of Privileges and Members&#x27; Interests which concluded “it (had) received no clear evidence that Mr Billson had been improperly influenced in the performance of his duties as a Member…and that no finding of contempt could be made”. It recommended in March 2018 that Billson be censured for failing to disclose receiving a salary for the FCA, and for undertaking work for the organisation through his consultancy business before leaving parliament. The Committee&#x27;s report stated that Billson&#x27;s &quot;decision to accept the role with FCA while he was a member falls below the standards expected of a member of the house&quot;. On 27 March the House of Representatives passed a motion censuring Billson.

Beginning 11 March 2021 he took up a government role as the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, replacing Kate Carnell. The news site Crikey noted that the role of Small Business Ombudsman had been initially created by Billson while he was the Minister for Small Business.

<doc id="559137" wikidata="Q1998677" url="?curid=559137" title="Pascagoula Abduction">
<text>The Pascagoula Abduction was an alleged UFO sighting and alien abduction in 1973, in which Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed they were abducted and examined before being released by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula, Mississippi.

==Alleged abduction==
On the evening of October 11, 1973, 42-year-old Charles Hickson and 19-year-old Calvin Parker told the Jackson County, Mississippi, sheriff&#x27;s office they were fishing off a pier on the west bank of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi when they heard a whirring/whizzing sound, saw two flashing blue lights, and observed an oval shaped object across and high. Parker and Hickson claimed they were &quot;conscious but paralyzed&quot; while three &quot;creatures&quot; with &quot;robotic slit-mouths&quot; and &quot;crab-like pincers&quot; took them aboard the object and subjected them to an examination.

==Publicity and later activities==
Following the incident, Hickson gave interviews and lectures, appeared on television (including an episode of the game show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;), in 1974 claimed additional encounters with aliens, and in 1983 authored a self-published book &quot;UFO Contact at Pascagoula&quot;. Parker later attended UFO conventions, and in 1993 started a company called &quot;UFO Investigations&quot; to produce television stories about UFOs.

In September 2011, Hickson died of a heart attack at the age of 80.

In 2018, Parker released his book, entitled &quot;Pascagoula: The Closest Encounter, My Story&quot;, which is &quot;the first full account of the event given by Parker along with how it affected his life&quot;.

On June 22, 2019, a historical marker was unveiled at the site of the alleged abduction, funded by the historical society and with placement approved by the city. Parker attended the unveiling, as did Hickson&#x27;s son and family. Parker stated, &quot;It is emotional for me. I can&#x27;t really describe it because I would break out in tears if I do. I wish when I died I could be buried right here underneath this plaque, that would explain it the best. It is quite an honor.&quot;

Parker died from kidney cancer in August 2023 at the age of 68.

==Skepticism==
Aviation journalist and UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass found &quot;discrepancies&quot; in Hickson&#x27;s story, noted that Hickson refused to take a polygraph exam conducted by an experienced examiner, and concluded that the case was a hoax. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell wrote that Hickson&#x27;s behavior was &quot;questionable&quot; and that Hickson later altered or embellished his claims. Nickell speculated that Hickson may have fantasized the alien encounter during a hypnagogic &quot;waking dream state&quot;, and suggested that Parker&#x27;s corroboration of the tale was likely due to suggestibility because he initially told police he had &quot;passed out at the beginning of the incident and failed to regain consciousness until it was over&quot;, a claim supported by Hickson during his &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; appearance.

<doc id="559138" wikidata="Q4974135" url="?curid=559138" title="Bronwyn Bishop">
<text>Bronwyn Kathleen Bishop (née Setright; born 19 October 1942) is an Australian former politician who served as the 29th speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 2013 to 2015, during the Abbott government. A member of the Liberal Party of Australia, she served as a senator for New South Wales from 1987 to 1994 after which she became the member of parliament (MP) for the division of Mackellar from 1994 to 2016. During her time in parliament she served as the minister for Defence Industry from 1996 to 1998 and minister for Aged Care from 1998 to 2001 under Prime Minister John Howard.

Bishop was born in Sydney and worked as a lawyer before entering politics. She served as state president of the New South Wales Liberals from 1985 to 1987, and then won election to the Senate at the 1987 federal election. She became the state&#x27;s second female senator and the first to be popularly elected. In 1994 Bishop switched to the House of Representatives, winning a by-election for the Division of Mackellar. She was a shadow minister under John Hewson, Alexander Downer, and John Howard.

In 1996 Bishop was appointed Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel in the newly elected Howard government. She was made Minister for Aged Care in 1998, but lost her place in the ministry after the 2001 election. Bishop returned to the shadow ministry after the Liberal–National Coalition lost the 2007 election. In 2013, following the election of the Abbott government, she was elected Speaker of the House, becoming the first non-Labor woman to hold the post. She resigned in mid-2015 after being caught in the centre of a travel-expenses scandal, and was defeated for Liberal preselection at the 2016 election, ending her parliamentary career. Since 2016, she has been a political commentator at Sky News Live.

== Early years and education ==
Bronwyn Kathleen Setright was born on 19 October 1942 at the Mater Hospital in North Sydney. Her father, Thomas Francis Setright (1909–1999), was an engineer, and her mother was Kathleen Annie Congreve (1912–1986), an opera singer who worked as a dramatic soprano at the Australian Opera Company. As a child, Bishop was sent to singing lessons by her mother.

Bishop was educated at Roseville Public School, completing her primary education in 1954. She then attended secondary school at Cremorne Girls High School, graduating in 1959. In 1960, Bishop enrolled in a five-year Bachelor of Laws program at the Sydney Law School, University of Sydney. However, she was deemed ineligible to continue her studies at the university after failing a number of subjects multiple times. Bishop failed a total of 11 subjects over six years. In her first year in 1960, she failed all four core subjects. In 1964, she failed four subjects again and repeated them in 1965, in which she failed three again. The policy of the University of Sydney at the time was that a student was required to show cause why they should be allowed to repeat a subject for a third time, and Bishop was deemed ineligible to continue.

During her university years, Bishop was not involved in student politics but was a member of the Killara branch of the Young Liberals. After leaving university, Bishop used the university subjects she had passed to apply for the Solicitors’ Admission Board (now the Legal Profession Admission Board) and was admitted to practise law as a solicitor in New South Wales in 1967. Bishop first worked as an articled clerk and then as a solicitor from 1967. She played an acting role as a barrister in the 1960s Australian television program &quot;Divorce Court&quot;.

==Politics==

Having formed an ambition to become a politician, she joined the Liberal Party at the age of 17.

Heavily involved in organised politics, Bishop joined Killara Young Liberals in 1961 and during her association with that branch, she became vice-president. She first became a Liberal Party office-holder in 1973 as president of the Balmoral branch and was later elected as the chairman of the Liberal Party Convention Committee from 1981 to 1985 and as the first female president of the NSW Liberals from 1985 to 1987.

She is formerly a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party.

===Senator (1987–1994)===
At the 1987 federal election, Bishop was elected to the Senate in the fifth position on the Coalition&#x27;s ticket in New South Wales. She was effectively a one-to-one replacement for Sir John Carrick, who was retiring from politics. She was the second woman to serve as a senator for New South Wales, and the first to be popularly elected; Sue West had been appointed to a casual vacancy a few months earlier, but had failed to retain her seat. Bishop was elevated to the shadow ministry by Andrew Peacock in 1989, as Shadow Minister for Public Administration, Federal Affairs and Local Government (1989–1990). She proved an aggressive debater against the Australian Labor Party, particularly with Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who during one debate in 1992 exclaimed to the chamber &quot;I am reminded of the exchange I heard recently in Parliament House when someone said, &#x27;Why do so many people take an instant dislike to Senator Bishop?&#x27; to which the answer was, &#x27;It saves time&#x27;.&quot;

===Move to the House of Representatives===
After the Coalition lost the 1993 election, speculation began to mount over John Hewson&#x27;s future as leader of the Liberal Party. From that time through to early 1994, a series of opinion polls showed Bishop to be among the most popular politicians in the country. She consistently polled ahead of Hewson as preferred Liberal leader, and a February 1994 poll gave her a 13-point lead as preferred prime minister over Paul Keating.

Shortly after the 1993 election, Jim Carlton, the Liberal member for Mackellar, resigned. In a move widely seen as furthering her leadership ambitions, Bishop resigned from the Senate on 24 February 1994 to contest the ensuing by-election for the safe Liberal seat. Although she was comfortably elected, her planned challenge to Hewson&#x27;s leadership faced a setback when she did not poll as well as expected against author and filmmaker Bob Ellis, who ran as an independent in the by-election. When Hewson called a spill for the Liberal leadership in 1994, Bishop opted not to stand as a candidate, and Alexander Downer successfully challenged for the party leadership.

Prior to his ousting by Downer, Hewson brought Bishop back to the frontbench as she had declined a frontbench position from him the previous year. Hewson appointed her as Shadow Minister for Urban and Regional Strategy.

The 1993 frontbench offer that Bishop had declined was as Shadow Minister for Privatisation and Administrative Affairs, a position in the Shadow Outer Ministry.

She declined this position as she felt it was an insult to a woman of her talent and dedication. A talent and dedication she felt would only be reflected by being a member of the Shadow Cabinet which she had demanded but was not acceded to by Hewson.
On refusing Privatisation and Administrative Affairs she says that she was not willing to put up with a junior portfolio of &quot;limited interest.&quot;

This portfolio now renamed Privatisation and Administrative Services went instead to David Connolly.

When Downer became leader, Bishop became Shadow Health Minister, a senior position, but caused controversy on her first day in office by announcing her support for tobacco advertising, drawing criticism from both the Australian Medical Association and her own party, which supported the Keating government&#x27;s legislation to prohibit tobacco advertising in 1992. Her remarks were attacked by the then AMA president and soon-to-be Liberal MP for the neighbouring seat of Bradfield, Brendan Nelson, who said that: &quot;Mrs Bishop has a lot to learn about health...there are now more than 50,000 pieces of medical research and literature supporting the view that smoking is injurious to humans.&quot; Bishop was dropped from Health and moved to Privatisation and Commonwealth/State Relations (1995–1996).

===Howard government (1996–2007)===
When the Liberals returned to Government in 1996, Prime Minister John Howard appointed Bishop a minister in junior portfolios. She was the first Liberal woman from New South Wales to become a minister. She was Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel from 11 March 1996 to 21 October 1998 and Minister for Aged Care from 21 October 1998 to 26 November 2001. It was in this role that she endured her greatest scandal, the kerosene baths controversy of 2000. The revelation that some residents at Melbourne&#x27;s Riverside Private Nursing Home had suffered blistering after being bathed in a weak kerosene solution as a cure for scabies led to a national outcry over the standards of care maintained by Bishop&#x27;s department. She was dropped from the ministry after the 2001 election. On 1 January 2001, Bishop was presented with the Centenary Medal &quot;For service to Australian society through parliament and government&quot;. In 2004, she campaigned to succeed Neil Andrew as Speaker of the House, but was not successful.

An affirmed monarchist, Bishop, along with fellow ministers Nick Minchin and Tony Abbott, supported the &quot;No&quot; campaign leading up to the failed 1999 Republican referendum and on one occasion spoke to Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, warning of the &quot;Seven deadly myths of the republican debate&quot;. On 17 July 1991, in response to the infamous debate on the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Midday&quot; television show with host Ray Martin, debating on Australia remaining a constitutional monarchy, in a live televised debate with singer Normie Rowe and radio broadcaster Ron Casey, who ended up physically brawling, Bishop issued a media release which said: &quot;It may well have been High Noon on the &quot;Midday Show&quot; when Ron Casey took a swipe at Normie Rowe but this conduct indicates just how divisive the debate on the Monarchy has become. Not content to see the country on its knees as a result of the recession the Labor Party must be pleased that it is dividing the community on an issue which has absolutely no political relevance.&quot;

In August 2005, Bishop called for Muslim headscarves to be banned from public schools, an opinion also expressed by another prominent Liberal backbencher, Sophie Mirabella. However, the Prime Minister, John Howard, said that he did not agree with this view as a ban would be impractical. In November 2005, Bishop expressed the view that &quot;she is opposed to the wearing of the Muslim headscarf, where it does not form part of the school uniform. This is because that in most cases the headscarf is being worn as a sign of defiance and difference between non-Muslim and Muslim students&quot; and then went on to say that she &quot;does not believe that a ban on the Jewish skull cap is necessary, because people of the Jewish faith have not used the skull cap as a way of campaigning against the Australian culture, laws and way of life.&quot;

On 21 January 2006, at a Young Liberals convention in Sydney, Bishop declared her intention to introduce a private members bill to make &quot;destroying or violating&quot; the Australian flag a federal offence. Shortly before the Howard government lost office, Bishop headed the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, and released the report &quot;The winnable war on drugs: The impact of illicit drug use on families&quot;. The report was highly critical of harm minimisation and suggested mandatory adoption of children under 5 years of age whose parents were known to use drugs. The report was widely criticised by a range of organisations such as Family Drug Support, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Drug Foundation for lacking evidence, being ideologically driven, and having the potential to do massive harm to Australia.

In 2006, following a flag-burning incident during the 2005 Cronulla riots and a burnt flag display by a Melbourne artist, Bishop introduced the &quot;Protection of the Australian National Flag (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2006&quot;. This bill sought to make it &quot;a criminal offence to wilfully destroy or otherwise mutilate the Flag in circumstances where a reasonable person would infer that the destruction or mutilation is intended publicly to express contempt or disrespect for the Flag or the Australian Nation.&quot; The bill received a second reading but subsequently lapsed and did not go to vote in the House of Representatives.

===Opposition (2007–2013)===
In the 2007 federal election, Bishop was re-elected to her seat with a 0.62-point primary swing and 3.04-point two-party-preferred swing against her on slightly redistributed boundaries. After his appointment as Liberal Leader, Brendan Nelson appointed Bishop to the Shadow Ministry portfolio of Veterans&#x27; Affairs.

Nelson bringing back Bishop to the frontbench was in contrast to their past conflict in 1994 when Bishop as Shadow Health Minister defended tobacco advertising which was contrary to the position taken by Nelson, then President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA).

However, after the election of Malcolm Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party, she was dropped from this portfolio, to return to the backbench. Despite speculation that she would be challenged for preselection in her seat of Mackellar for the next election, this did not eventuate and she later reaffirmed her intention to contest the next election. On 5 May 2009, Bishop criticised Turnbull&#x27;s leadership, saying &quot;Malcolm seems to have been strong at the beginning but now he has gone soft.&quot; However, with Turnbull&#x27;s loss of the party leadership and the election of Tony Abbott as his successor, on 8 December 2009 Bishop was appointed as Shadow Minister for Seniors. Bishop was re-elected at the 2010 Election and was appointed to the outer shadow ministry as Shadow Special Minister of State and Shadow Minister for Seniors. In April 2011, Bishop stated that she believed former Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s decision to include an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in the 2007 Coalition policy platform was a mistake. She went on to question humans&#x27; contribution to the warming of the planet, suggesting that &quot;climate changes continually, and if we have got to do something about it we have got to learn to adapt&quot;.

===Speaker of the House (2013–2015)===

Following the Coalition victory at the federal election on 7 September 2013, Tony Abbott announced Bishop as the Coalition&#x27;s nominee as next Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives. Bishop was elected as Speaker on 12 November 2013. Her tenure was largely concurrent with the premiership of Abbott. She was the third woman, and the first non-Labor woman, to hold the post. She was also the first former senator to become Speaker of the lower house. She opted against wearing the full traditional attire of the Speaker like her predecessor Peter Slipper, instead continuing to wear ordinary business attire.

In October 2014, Bishop became the longest-serving woman in the history of the Australian Parliament, outstripping the record of 27 years and 3 months previously held by Kathy Sullivan. In November 2014 Bishop lost her bid for presidency of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

Bishop received significant criticism for her partisanship and claims of bias as speaker. The speaker&#x27;s role is expected to be nonpartisan. The perception of bias led to the opposition unsuccessfully attempting to move a motion of no confidence in Bishop&#x27;s speakership in 2014. During her tenure in the chair, Bishop ejected Labor MPs from the House 393 times, but Coalition MPs only seven times. Bishop had also continued to attend Liberal party room meetings during her speakership, despite convention against this.

====Expenses controversy and resignation====
In mid-July 2015, Bishop became embroiled in the &quot;Choppergate&quot; expenses scandal surrounding her use of parliamentary travel entitlements that ultimately led to her resignation as Speaker. It had emerged that she had chartered helicopter flights from Melbourne to Geelong and back to attend a state Liberal Party fundraiser on 5 November 2014. The cost of the flights was $5,227.27 for a journey that typically takes an hour each way by road. Bishop refused to resign over the expenses claim, describing it as an &quot;error of judgement&quot;, while expressing disappointment that the controversy had become a distraction from the opposition and its policies. However, she agreed to pay back the sum of the helicopter flight plus a penalty of $1,307.

The controversy was fuelled by further revelations of spending on travel. In 2014, Bishop and four parliamentary delegates spent $88,084 on a two-week trip to Europe in her bid for presidency of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, including almost $1,000 a day on private limousines. Bishop also incurred costs of over $3,300 for car expenses in order to attend the opera and other arts events from 2010 to 2013 and $800 for flights to the wedding of Sophie Mirabella in Albury.

In response to the controversy, Tony Abbott declared Bishop was on what he termed &quot;probation&quot;, calling her behaviour &quot;out of line&quot;, though maintaining his confidence in the Speaker. A transcript of Tony Abbott&#x27;s comments calling for Prime Minister Julia Gillard to make Peter Slipper resign over a travel expenses scandal was also removed from the Liberal Party&#x27;s website. On 31 July, Tony Abbott announced that the Department of Finance would be reviewing all expenses claimed by Bishop over the past 10 years, including the $800,000 claimed during 2014.

Bowing to political pressure, Bishop resigned the speakership on 2 August 2015 and moved to the backbench. Commentators noted that Prime Minister Abbott would have had to deal with the probability that &quot;a significant number of government MPs would not support her in a no-confidence motion.&quot;

Bishop repaid over $6,700 after an investigation into her finances, but did not give the Department of Finance enough information about her engagements for them to determine whether they were a legitimate use of taxpayer funds or not. She said that she would no longer be cooperating with the review after her retirement from the parliament. Bishop had provided statements for the financial years 2005–06, 2006–07 and 2013–14.

==== Return to the backbench ====
Though it was initially speculated that the 73-year-old MP would leave parliament at the 2016 federal election, Bishop announced in December 2015 her intent to recontest her seat of Mackellar, claiming she had been &quot;exonerated&quot; over the &quot;Choppergate&quot; expenses scandal, and that the &quot;threat of terrorism&quot; had convinced her she needs to remain in Parliament. Support from the local Liberal branches in her seat had been &quot;dented&quot; following revelations she voted for Malcolm Turnbull in the September 2015 Liberal leadership spill before unsuccessfully lobbying senior Liberals for a ministry in the Turnbull government, a charge which a cabinet minister confirmed but was denied by Bishop. In challenges for preselection, candidate Walter Villatora was endorsed by Mike Baird and Tony Abbott to replace Bishop, and former Wallaby player Bill Calcraft was endorsed by Alan Jones. Bishop was eventually defeated by Jason Falinski by 51 votes to 39. Falinski retained Mackellar for the Liberals at the 2016 election.

==After politics==
Bishop joined Sky News Live as a political contributor in June 2016, making her debut on &quot;Speers Tonight&quot; on 2 June 2016.

In November 2016, Bishop attended a party at The Rugby Club in Sydney to celebrate the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election.

On 26 November 2018, her official Speaker&#x27;s painting was hung in Parliament House. It was painted by Jiawei Shen and was attended by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Speaker of the House Tony Smith, her family and other members of the Liberal Party of Australia including the Liberal Chief Whip, Nola Marino.

Bishop was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2020 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, to the people of New South Wales, and to women in politics.

==Personal life==
Bishop is an amateur actress, having appeared in several charity productions including &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (as Baroness Elsa), and &quot;Grease&quot; (as the Headmistress). In 2007, she sang a duet of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;A Couple of Swells&quot; with then Health Minister, Tony Abbott, and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Julie Bishop, at a fund-raiser in Sydney. Bishop is also a patron of Opera Australia and was 2008 President of the Sydney International Piano Competition Committee.

In 1966, she married Alan David Bishop , with whom she studied law at the University of Sydney. Alan Bishop was a judge of the now defunct Compensation Court and the District Court of New South Wales and was instrumental in the establishment of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales. He is honoured by the Bishops&#x27; alma mater with the Alan Bishop Scholarship for distinguished final-year undergraduate law students. Alan Bishop also served as an alderman of the City of Sydney and was involved in multiple committees and companies, including the public medical research company AGITG.

Bronwyn and Alan Bishop have two daughters; Angela, an entertainment reporter for Network Ten, and Sally. Bronwyn and Alan Bishop divorced in 1992.

<doc id="559143" wikidata="Q434858" url="?curid=559143" title="Julie Bishop">
<text>Julie Isabel Bishop (born 17 July 1956) is an Australian former politician who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2018 and deputy leader of the Liberal Party from 2007 to 2018. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Curtin from 1998 to 2019. She has been the chancellor of the Australian National University since January 2020.

Bishop was born in Lobethal, South Australia, and studied law at the University of Adelaide. Prior to entering politics she worked as a commercial lawyer in Perth, Western Australia; she was the local managing partner of Clayton Utz. She was a delegate to the 1998 constitutional convention, and also served as a director of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) and as a member of the Murdoch University senate. Bishop was elected to parliament at the 1998 federal election, representing the Division of Curtin in Perth&#x27;s western suburbs. In the Howard government, she served as Minister for Ageing (2003–2006), Minister for Education and Science (2006–2007), and Minister for Women (2006–2007).

After the Coalition lost the 2007 election, Bishop was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to hold the position, and was re-elected to the post at multiple leadership spills following her initial election. During her time as deputy, there were three different Liberal leaders—Brendan Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull, and Tony Abbott. When the Coalition returned to power at the 2013 election, Bishop was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Abbott government. She was Australia&#x27;s first female foreign minister. Issues that arose during her tenure included changes to the Australian foreign aid program, the international military intervention against ISIL, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, and the execution of Australian citizens by Indonesia.

In August 2018, Peter Dutton challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, due to dissatisfaction from the party&#x27;s conservative wing. Turnbull defeated Dutton in a leadership ballot, but tensions continued to mount and the party voted in favour of holding a second spill; Bishop chose to be a candidate. In the second vote, Bishop was eliminated in the first round by Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison, with Morrison elected as party leader (and thus prime minister) in the second round. She declined to retain the foreign affairs portfolio in the Morrison Ministry, instead moving to the backbench. Bishop retired from politics on 11 April 2019, before the impending federal election.

On 1 January 2020 Bishop commenced her term as chancellor of the Australian National University. She is the first woman to be in this position.

In April 2024 Bishop was appointed United Nations special envoy for Myanmar.

==Early life==
Bishop was born on 17 July 1956 in Lobethal, South Australia. She is the third of four children born to Isabel Mary (née Wilson) and Douglas Alan Bishop; she has two older sisters and a younger brother. Bishop has described her parents as &quot;classic Menzies Liberals&quot;. Her father was a returned soldier and orchardist, while her mother&#x27;s family were sheep and wheat farmers. Both her mother and grandfather William Bishop were active in local government, serving terms as mayor of the East Torrens District Council.

Bishop grew up on an apple and cherry orchard in Basket Range. The year before she was born, it was burned to the ground in the Black Sunday bushfires. Bishop began her education at Basket Range Primary School and later attended St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Girls&#x27; School in Adelaide. She was the head prefect in her final year. Bishop went on to study law at the University of Adelaide. She worked two part-time jobs as a barmaid while at university—one at Football Park and one at a pub in Uraidla. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1978.

==Professional career==
After graduating law school, Bishop joined Wallmans, an Adelaide-based law firm, as its first female articled clerk. She left after less than a year, in part due to an incident where a senior partner asked her to perform waitressing duties. In 1982, aged 26, she became a partner in the firm of Mangan, Ey &amp; Bishop. The following year, she married West Australian property developer Neil Gillon, and moved to Perth.

On arriving in WA, Bishop joined Robinson Cox as a solicitor specialising in commercial litigation and was made a full partner in 1985. According to Kerry Stokes, &quot;in the legal profession she was a very determined, reasoned person [...] there&#x27;s not been much written about what a good executive Julie was—responsible for administering and running a partnership, not just a lawyer&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Robinson Cox was hired by CSR Limited to defend against compensation claims brought by asbestos mining workers, who had contracted mesothelioma while working for Midalco, a subsidiary of CSR. Bishop was part of the team assigned to the case, which developed an argument that a company was not legally responsible for the actions of its subsidiaries. The Supreme Court of Western Australia eventually decided to pierce the corporate veil and hold CSR liable for Midalco&#x27;s actions; the lead litigant died before the conclusion of the case, which lasted eight months. After becoming a public figure, Bishop was accused by opponents of acting immorally by involving herself in the case. She has said she conducted herself ethically and professionally, and per procedural advice given by barristers Robert French and David Malcolm (both future judges).

As a legal advisor to the Western Australian Development Corporation, Bishop assisted in the incorporation of several new government enterprises, including Gold Corporation (the operator of the Perth Mint), LandCorp, and Eventscorp (a division of Tourism Western Australia). Robinson Cox merged into the larger firm of Clayton Utz in 1992, and she was made managing partner of the firm&#x27;s Perth office in 1994. In the same year, she took up an appointment as chair of the state government&#x27;s Town Planning Appeal Tribunal, serving a three-year term. In 1996, Bishop attended Harvard Business School for eight weeks to complete the Advanced Management Programme for senior managers. She has credited one of her lecturers there, George C. Lodge, with inspiring her to enter public life. In 1997, she was elected to the senate of Murdoch University and appointed as a director of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).

==Early political involvement==
Bishop joined the Liberal Party in 1992. She has credited the WA Inc scandal with making her think she &quot;did not ever want to see a Labor government elected again&quot;. She was chosen as the president of the Liberal party&#x27;s CBD branch the year she joined the party, serving until 1997. In 1998, Senator Nick Minchin invited her to serve as an appointed delegate to the 1998 national constitutional convention. She was a &quot;minimalist republican&quot;, and voted against the final model because she considered it too radical and unlikely to succeed at a referendum. At the convention, she became acquainted with Peter Costello, at the time serving as Treasurer under John Howard.

==Howard government==
===First years in parliament===
Prior to the 1998 federal election, Bishop won Liberal preselection for the Division of Curtin, which takes in Perth&#x27;s western suburbs. Her preselection bid received the support of Premier Richard Court, who had earmarked her as a future member of federal cabinet. The seat had been held for 17 years by Allan Rocher, who was a personal friend of Prime Minister John Howard but had left the Liberals in 1995 to sit as an independent. Howard did not want the Liberals to run a candidate against Rocher, and refused to campaign for Bishop; however, Peter Costello and Alexander Downer both supported her candidacy and Costello launched her campaign. At the election, she reclaimed the seat for the Liberals with a large swing in her favour.

After the Liberal Party lost the 2001 state election in Western Australia, Bishop was suggested by multiple media sources as a possible replacement for Richard Court as state Liberal leader (and thus Leader of the Opposition). It was later confirmed that Court favoured an arrangement where he and his deputy and factional rival, Colin Barnett, would resign their seats in the Legislative Assembly. Bishop would resign from federal Parliament and hand her seat to Barnett, and Court would hand the leadership of the WA Liberals to Bishop once she was safely in the state legislature by way of winning either Court or Barnett&#x27;s old seats, both of which were within Curtin&#x27;s boundaries and were comfortably safe for the Liberals. However, Bishop eventually rejected the deal.

===Elevation to the ministry===

Bishop was appointed Minister for Ageing by Prime Minister John Howard in 2003. She was later promoted to Minister for Education and Science and Minister for Women in 2006 and served in those positions until the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 federal election.

As education minister, Bishop&#x27;s policies centred on the development of national education standards as well as performance-based pay for teachers. On 13 April 2007, the Australian State Governments jointly expressed opposition to Bishop&#x27;s pay policy. In the 2007 budget, the Federal Government announced a $5 billion &quot;endowment fund&quot; for higher education, with the expressed goal of providing world-class tertiary institutions in Australia. Some of Bishop&#x27;s public comments on education, including the remark that &quot;the states have ideologically hijacked school syllabi and are wasting $180 million in unnecessary duplication&quot;, were criticised by teachers. An advance media kit for a 2006 speech claimed parts of the contemporary curriculum came &quot;straight from Chairman Mao&quot;; the remark was dropped from her speech.

==Deputy Leader of the Opposition==
Following the 2007 election, Bishop was elected Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party on 29 November 2007; Brendan Nelson was elected Leader. In a ballot of Liberal Party room members, Bishop comfortably won with 44 votes, one more than the combined total of her two competitors, Andrew Robb (with 25 votes) and Christopher Pyne (with 18 votes).
On 22 September 2008, Bishop was promoted to the role of Shadow Treasurer by Nelson&#x27;s successor as Opposition Leader, Malcolm Turnbull, making her the first woman to hold that portfolio. On 16 February 2009, however, she was moved from that position, with widespread media speculation that her colleagues were dissatisfied with her performance in the role. She was instead given the job of Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. After Tony Abbott was elected Liberal Leader following the 2009 leadership spill, Bishop retained her roles as Deputy Leader and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs.

In 2010, Bishop defended the suspected forgery of Australian passports by Mossad, saying that many countries practised the forging of passports for intelligence operations, including Australia. The Rudd government attacked Bishop over the statements, saying she had &quot;broken a long-standing convention&quot; of not speculating about intelligence practices. She later clarified her statement, saying, &quot;I have no knowledge of any Australian authority forging any passports of any nation.&quot;

Following the Coalition&#x27;s narrow loss in the 2010 federal election, Bishop was re-elected unanimously as Deputy Leader by her colleagues and retained the position of Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, while also being given the additional responsibility of Shadow Minister for Trade.

==Minister for Foreign Affairs==

After the Coalition won the 2013 federal election, new Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed Bishop as Minister for Foreign Affairs; she was sworn in by Governor-General Quentin Bryce on 18 September 2013. She became the only female member of the cabinet and was given the third-highest rank, after Abbott and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss. In the months following her appointment several media reports claimed that Bishop, along with Social Services Minister Scott Morrison, were regarded internally as the best performing ministers in the Government.

In December 2014, Bishop became only the second woman to serve as acting prime minister, after Julia Gillard. Throughout her tenure as foreign minister, Bishop had been frequently tipped by political commentators as a possible future leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister.

===Foreign aid===

One of Bishop&#x27;s first steps after being appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs was to introduce sweeping changes to the Australian foreign aid program. These changes included abolition of the Australian foreign aid agency, AusAID, and extensive expenditure cuts.

The new government was sworn into office on 18 September 2013. Incoming Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the same day that AusAID would be integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT). The news of the proposed integration had been conveyed by Bishop to senior AusAID staff some days earlier. The official explanation for the integration of AusAID into DFAT was that “Integration will enable DFAT to better pursue Australia&#x27;s national interests by ensuring closer alignment and mutually reinforcing linkages among the Government&#x27;s aid, foreign affairs and trade efforts.”

The impact of the integration on the quality of Australia&#x27;s aid program led to considerable debate. Sceptics pointed to the departure of a considerable number of experienced aid professionals from the former AusAID while the process of integration was taking place and argued that the culture and priorities of DFAT were not supportive of a quality aid program. Those in favour of the change argued that closer alignment with foreign affairs would ensure that the aid program was more relevant and would provide better value for money.

Subsequently, Bishop announced substantial expenditure cuts in the aid program. In Opposition, the Liberal Party had publicly endorsed the aim of maintaining the Australian aid budget at the level of 0.5% of GDP. Aid spending amounted to around $5.0 billion in 2014/15. However budget cuts introduced after the new government took office led to marked reductions. Expenditure was reduced to around $4.2 billion in 2015/16. Further reductions were introduced in following years. Aid spending as a share of GDP fell from 0.32% in 2014/15 to an estimated 0.23% in 2018/19.

===New Colombo Plan===
Months after the Abbott government took office, Bishop announced the implementation of a New Colombo Plan which would provide undergraduate students with funding to study in several different locations within the Indo-Pacific. The plan started off in pilot form and after initial success the full program was rolled out in 2015.

===ISIS fighters===
In a 2015 speech explaining the Australian Government&#x27;s measures against ISIS, Bishop compared the psychological underpinnings of ISIS with that of Nazism. Citing Eric Hoffer&#x27;s seminal work &quot;The True Believer&quot;, she argued that the declared Caliphate drew from the same source that drove the masses to support Hitler; &quot;Invincibility was—until the US-led airstrikes—all part of its attraction.&quot;

In October 2014, Man Haron Monis wrote to Attorney-General George Brandis asking if Monis could contact the leader of ISIS, two months before he took hostages in the Sydney siege. On 28 May 2015, Bishop told Parliament that the letter was provided to a review of the siege, before correcting the record three days later.

===UN Security Council===

Although Bishop fought against the Gillard government&#x27;s campaign to gain Australia a temporary two-year seat on the United Nations Security Council, she was widely lauded for her commanding performance when representing Australia on the Council in her capacity as Foreign Minister. She negotiated a successful resolution that was adopted by the Council in regards to gaining full access to the crash site of Flight MH17.

During the month of November 2014, Bishop chaired the Security Council and led meeting to discuss the threat of foreign fights, UN peacekeeping and the Ebola epidemic. Later, Bishop led negotiations to pass a resolution to set up an independent criminal tribunal into the downing of Flight MH17. Although Russia vetoed the resolution, Bishop was widely praised by other delegates for her work and for her strong statement following the veto that &quot;the anticipated excuses and obfuscation by the Russian Federation should be treated with the utmost disdain&quot;.

===Iran===

In April 2015, Bishop paid an official visit to Iran, following the conclusion of a visit to India. She was the first Australian government minister to visit the country since 2003, having been personally invited by Iran&#x27;s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. They discussed the proposed nuclear deal and issues relating to Iranian asylum seekers in Australia. Bishop wore a headscarf or a hat for the duration of her visit, and did not shake hands with male dignitaries in order to avoid offending local sensibilities. She received some criticism for doing so, with Andrew Bolt rhetorically asking whether she should have &quot;subjugated herself&quot; to Islamic law. Head coverings are not mandatory for foreign women visiting Iran. In response, she said: &quot;As a matter of fact I wear scarves and hats and headgear quite often as part of my everyday wear&quot;.

===Myanmar===
In early September 2017, as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar became ethnic cleansing, Bishop said that Australia was deeply concerned by the escalating violence in Myanmar&#x27;s Rakhine State and would provide up to to help Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. In 2018, Bishop called &quot;for an end to the violence, for full and unhindered humanitarian access … and a full and transparent accountability of the human rights abuses&quot;. She also said that Australia&#x27;s relationship with Myanmar Army &quot;is designed to help promote positive change in Myanmar&quot;.

===Indonesia===
Bishop was involved at the highest level of negotiations with the Indonesian Government in attempts to save the lives of convicted drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. Demonstrating Australia&#x27;s opposition to the death penalty, Bishop was widely applauded for the manner in which she conducted negotiations. This was in stark contrast to the criticism faced by Tony Abbott who was ridiculed for remarks he made in regards to foreign aid provided by Australia to Indonesia. Despite the Government&#x27;s efforts, both Chan and Sukumaran were executed in April 2015. As a result of the executions, Bishop recalled the Australian Ambassador from Indonesia in condemnation of their decision.

By August 2015, Bishop stated that Australia&#x27;s relationship with Indonesia was &quot;back on track&quot; after privately meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister to discuss the fallout from the executions.

===China===
In May 2018, Geoff Raby, a former Australian Ambassador to China, criticised Bishop&#x27;s handling of Australia–China relations, stating she had neglected the relationship between the countries and had angered Chinese leaders with &quot;strident public comments on the South China Sea&quot; and a speech questioning China&#x27;s regional leadership. He called on Malcolm Turnbull to &quot;replace the Foreign Minister with someone better equipped for the demands of the job&quot;. In response, Bishop said that Raby was &quot;profoundly ignorant [...] about the level of engagement between Australia and China at present and the state of the relationship&quot;, and that he had not spoken to her or her office in several years. Turnbull said the opinion piece was &quot;utterly wrong&quot; and described Bishop as &quot;a formidable foreign minister, a great diplomat and a great colleague&quot;.

===Resignation and replacement===
On 26 August 2018, Bishop issued a statement indicating that she would resign as Minister for Foreign Affairs. She was replaced by Senator Marise Payne on 28 August.

==Liberal leadership issues==

===February 2015 leadership spill===
In February 2015, in response to rising criticisms of his leadership, Tony Abbott called a spill of leadership positions. Both Julie Bishop and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull were reported by the media as considering challenging for the leadership. Opinion poll results consistently showed that both Bishop and Turnbull were preferred by the public to Abbott. Eventually a motion to move a leadership spill fell by 61 votes to 39, and Abbott consequentially remained in office.

===September 2015 leadership spill===

On 14 September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull challenged Tony Abbott for the leadership of the Liberal Party. After Turnbull was elected, Bishop defeated a challenge from Kevin Andrews to retain her position as Deputy Leader by 70 votes to 30. Hours before Turnbull&#x27;s challenge, Bishop had visited Abbott to advise him he had lost the confidence of the Parliamentary Liberal Party. She is said to have intended to vote for Abbott in the leadership vote until he declared her position vacant as well as his, after which she voted for Turnbull. Bishop was retained as Foreign Minister following the formation of the Turnbull government.

===August 2018 leadership spills===

On 21 August 2018, Malcolm Turnbull called a leadership spill and defeated challenger Peter Dutton by 48 votes to 35. The deputy leadership was also declared vacant, with Bishop re-elected as deputy leader unopposed. Over the following days, there was widespread speculation about a second spill being called, and multiple media outlets reported on 23 August that Bishop would be a candidate for the leadership if that eventuated. A second spill was called on 24 August, and Bishop was eliminated on the first ballot with 11 votes out of 85 (or 12.9 percent). Morrison was elected leader over Dutton on the second ballot, and Josh Frydenberg was chosen as deputy leader. Bishop is the first woman to formally stand for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and only the second woman to stand for the leadership of one of Australia&#x27;s two major parties, after the Labor Party&#x27;s Julia Gillard.

==Political positions==
Bishop is regarded as a being a moderate within the Liberal Party, and has been described as holding similar views to Malcolm Turnbull. She has stated that she regards herself a &quot;very liberal-minded person&quot;, an &quot;economic dry and a social liberal&quot;, and a &quot;Menzian Liberal&quot;.

Bishop is in favour of an Australian republic, having served as a delegate at the Constitutional Convention of 1998. When a conscience vote has been allowed by the Liberal Party, Bishop has always voted in a &quot;progressive&quot; manner, voting in favour of allowing stem cell research and for removing ministerial oversight of the abortion pill RU486.

===Same-sex marriage===
During the internal debate on same-sex marriage which divided the Liberal Party in August 2015, Bishop refused to publicly declare her personal views on the matter. However, her statement that she was &quot;very liberally minded&quot; on the topic was taken by many to be an allusion towards support of same-sex marriage. In a television interview in November 2015, Bishop confirmed that she supported same-sex marriage.

In August 2015, Bishop spoke in favour of holding a plebiscite on the matter, believing that the issue should be put to a democratic vote so that it could no longer distract from the government&#x27;s policy agenda. This ultimately became the policy adopted by the government. Following the postal plebiscite in 2017, which resulted in a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, Bishop stated that she had voted in support of same-sex marriage.

==Retirement and later life==
Following her retirement from political life, Bishop took up a position on the board of the professional services company Palladium. In early August 2019 it was announced that she had agreed to take up the position of chancellor of Australian National University (ANU), commencing in January 2020. She would be the university&#x27;s first female chancellor. Her predecessor is Gareth Evans, another former foreign minister. As chancellor, she will receive an annual honorarium of $75,000, the same amount as the outgoing chancellor Evans received in his final year.

When the United Kingdom assumed the presidency of the G7 in 2021, Bishop was appointed by the country&#x27;s Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss to a newly formed Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) chaired by Sarah Sands. From 2021 to 2022, she was a member of the Trilateral Commission’s Task Force on Global Capitalism in Transition, chaired by Carl Bildt, Kelly Grier and Takeshi Niinami. In early March 2023 it was announced that she had signed on to speak at a series of leadership events in Sydney and Melbourne with former president of the United States Barack Obama. Later that month Bishop joined luxury Australian department store David Jones in a brand ambassador role.

On 6 April 2024 Bishop was appointed to the role of United Nations special envoy to Myanmar by secretary-general Antonio Guterres, succeeding Noeleen Heyzer in this role.

Consulting Work

Following her retirement from Parliament, Bishop established consulting firm &quot;Julie Bishop &amp; Partners&quot;. It was reported in January 2020 that Bishop had taken up a position with the UK financial firm Greensill Capital in December 2019 to &quot;provide strategic advice to Greensill and serve as chair of Greensill Asia Pacific&quot; as the company accelerated its expansion in the region. Lex Greensill, the founder of Greensill Capital, said that the company would &quot;draw on Julie&#x27;s unparalleled experience and expertise -- particularly her international credentials cemented during five years as Australia&#x27;s foreign minister.&quot;

Over a year later, a scandal involving Greensill emerged in the United Kingdom. In April 2021 it was reported in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that former UK prime minister David Cameron had been involved in lobbying activities within the UK government on behalf of Greensill. Shortly afterwards, it was reported in &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot; that as part of Bishop&#x27;s consulting activities with Greensill Capital in early 2020, she had attended meetings in Davos in Switzerland organised by Lex Greensill. In the meetings in Davos, Bishop joined with David Cameron to meet Lex Greensill to discuss the affairs of the company. In Davos, she and Lex Greensill also reportedly met the then-Australian finance minister Mathias Cormann. Cormann, who in March 2021 was elected as Secretary-General of the OECD, is reported to have said that he was asked by Bishop to meet with Lex Greensill and David Cameron. These meetings in Davos took place shortly after Bishop had taken up her position as Chancellor of the ANU. Bishop&#x27;s activities with Greensill in Davos were reportedly arranged &quot;in the margins&quot; of an ANU function for Australians and Australian businesses in Davos. In June, it was reported that Australian Treasury officials had confirmed to an Australian Senate committee that Bishop had lobbied Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on behalf of Greensill and that Labor Party members of the Australian Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services were pressing to have Bishop called before the committee for questioning. In connection with Bishop&#x27;s connections with Greensill, the Australian Attorney General&#x27;s Department confirmed that the Department had written to Bishop seeking clarification of her role at Greensill at the time that she contacted Frydenberg&#x27;s office on behalf of the company.

==Personal life==
Bishop was married to property developer Neil Gillon from 1983 to 1988, taking his surname for the duration of the marriage. She later had relationships with Senator Ross Lightfoot and former Lord Mayor of Perth Peter Nattrass. She was in a relationship with businessman David Panton from 2014 to 2022.

Bishop does not have children. In response to repeated media inquiries about the subject, she has stated that &quot;I&#x27;m not having kids, there&#x27;s no point lamenting what was or what could have been&quot;, and that she feels &quot;incredibly lucky that I&#x27;ve had the kind of career that is so consuming that I don&#x27;t feel I have a void in my life&quot;.

==Legacy==
In July 2021, Mattel created a Julie Bishop Barbie doll &quot;for her trailblazing political career.&quot;

<text>Laurence John Brereton (born 29 May 1946) is an Australian former politician who was a state minister, a federal member of cabinet, and kingmaker in the election of several Australian Labor Party leaders, including Paul Keating and Mark Latham. He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1990 to October 2004, representing the Division of Kingsford Smith, New South Wales. He is credited with building Sydney&#x27;s controversial monorail.

==Early life==
Brereton was born in the Sydney suburb of Kensington, and was educated at De La Salle Catholic College, Coogee, now defunct. He was apprenticed and worked as an electrical tradesman to the Sydney County Council, a former council-owned retailer of electricity in inner Sydney.

==Political career==
===New South Wales politics===
Brereton served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as member for Randwick 1970–71 and Heffron 1973–90. He survived the political controversy of the Botany Council affair in the mid-&#x27;70s when he was accused of attempting to influence ALP aldermen who were considering an application to rezone a block of land. He and Geoffrey Cahill, then Labor&#x27;s NSW general secretary (and grandson of former Premier Joseph Cahill), appeared in court on bribery and conspiracy charges but after 17 days of hearings and evidence from high-powered witnesses, including Rupert Murdoch, all charges were thrown out.

In the governments led by Neville Wran and (from 1986) Barrie Unsworth, Brereton was Minister for Health 1981–84, Minister for Roads 1983–84 and 1984–87, Minister for Public Works 1984–87 and Minister for Employment 1984.

===Federal politics===
Upon switching to the federal Parliament, Brereton was Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister 1991–93, Minister for Industrial Relations 1993–96, Minister for Transport 1993–96, and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters 1993. In March 1996, the ALP government lost office to John Howard.

Brereton was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1996–2001 serving as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. Assisted by his adviser, Dr Philip Dorling, Brereton was instrumental in revising Federal Labor policy to support self-determination and independence for East Timor. Brereton was a vocal critic of Howard, who supported East Timor&#x27;s continued integration in Indonesia. He was also strongly critical of the performance of past Labor Governments, in particular Prime Minister Gough Whitlam who acquiesced to Indonesia&#x27;s intentions to invade East Timor in 1975.
During 1998 and 1999 Brereton highlighted evidence of the Indonesian military&#x27;s involvement in pro-integrationist violence in East Timor and was a strident advocate of United Nations peacekeeping to support East Timor&#x27;s independence ballot. Brereton was a member of the Australian Parliamentary observer mission that witnessed the conduct of the ballot.

Brereton&#x27;s break from previous Australian bipartisanship on East Timor policy was an important factor in the Howard Government&#x27;s eventual decision to change Australian policy and intervene in East Timor in September 1999. According to historian and former Australian Army officer Clinton Fernandes, &quot;The ALP&#x27;s change of policy – and the resulting pressure of the [Australian] Government – was a critical factor in the independence of East Timor.&quot; Brereton&#x27;s activism on the East Timor issue was strongly opposed by senior Labor political figures, notably Whitlam and former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and found little support from Federal Labor leader Kim Beazley. However Beazley was reluctant to challenge Brereton&#x27;s handling of the issue and eventually accepted the change in Labor policy. Following controversy in 1999, over leaked Australian intelligence reports relating to East Timor and the Indonesian military, Australian Federal Police and Defence Security agents raided Dr Dorling&#x27;s home in September 2000, but no classified material was found.

Taking into account his service in the New South Wales Parliament, Brereton had the longest period of parliamentary service of any member of the Parliament elected in 2001. In June 2004 he announced his retirement from politics at the 2004 federal election. He helped engineer the candidacy of the rock singer Peter Garrett as his successor in the seat.

==Personal life==

His wife, Justice Tricia Kavanagh, was a Judge on the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales. They have two sons. Brereton is the younger brother of Deirdre Grusovin.

<doc id="559147" wikidata="Q6740586" url="?curid=559147" title="Mal Brough">
<text>Malcolm Thomas Brough ( ; born 29 December 1961) is an Australian former politician. He represented the Liberal Party in the House of Representatives (1996–2007, 2013–2016) and held ministerial office in the Howard and Turnbull governments.

Brough was born in Brisbane and was an Australian Army officer and businessman before entering politics. He was first elected to parliament at the 1996 federal election, representing the Queensland seat of Longman. He was made a parliamentary secretary in 2000 and subsequently served as Minister for Employment Services (2001–2004) and Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (2004–2006). Brough was promoted to cabinet in 2006 as Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and subsequently oversaw the controversial Northern Territory Emergency Response. He lost his seat at the 2007 election, at which the government was defeated.

As state president of the Liberals, Brough opposed the merger which led to the creation of the Liberal National Party of Queensland in 2008. He returned to federal parliament in 2013, standing in the seat of Fisher. In September 2015 Brough was reappointed to the ministry by Malcolm Turnbull, who replaced Tony Abbott as Liberal leader and prime minister. However, his second stint as a minister lasted only until December 2015, as he resigned from the ministry following revelations that the Australian Federal Police had investigated him over his dealings with James Ashby. In February 2016 he announced that he would not seek preselection for the seat of Fisher at the 2016 federal election.

==Early life==
Brough was born on 29 December 1961 in Brisbane, Queensland. He served in the Australian Army from 1979 to 1987 following this he worked in the private sector. His brother Rob Brough is a &quot;Seven News&quot; presenter and former host of &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

There is a longstanding belief in Brough&#x27;s family that they have Indigenous Australian ancestry through his maternal grandmother, Violet Bowden. Bowden&#x27;s understanding was that her − mostly absent and estranged − father was Aboriginal. Brough does not seek to identify himself as Aboriginal, although he does not reject the possibility. His comments on the subject have, on at least one occasion, been interpreted as dismissive of his possible Aboriginal heritage, or Aboriginal culture in general. His sister, Carol Stubbs, has served on the board of several Aboriginal corporations.

==Political career==
Brough was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business 2000–2001 and Minister for Employment Services from 2001 to 2004. In July 2004 he was moved to the portfolios of Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue. He was Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs from January 2006 to November 2007. In his Indigenous Affairs portfolio, Brough was the chief architect of the government&#x27;s Northern Territory Emergency Response, a package of measures designed to combat alleged high rates of child neglect and abuse in the territory.

Brough was one of a number of government MPs including Prime Minister John Howard who lost their seats at the 2007 election. Brough suffered a swing of 10.3 points in the two-party-preferred vote in his seat, to finish with a vote of 46.4 percent. He was succeeded by Labor&#x27;s Jon Sullivan. Brough switched to the seat of Fisher and won it back from Liberal turned independent and the Speaker of the House of Representatives Peter Slipper at the 2013 federal election.

===State politics===
Brough was elected as the President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party in May 2008. He remained in that position after a vote in July 2008 to merge into the new Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP). He opposed the merger as it had not received final ratification from the federal Liberal Party. On 26 September 2008 he resigned from his post, saying: &quot;You try and do the right thing and, quite frankly, at this point it&#x27;s all over the shop and it&#x27;s no wonder voters get so disenchanted with the non-Labor side of politics.&quot;

It was because of his opposition of the merger to the LNP that he was not a candidate for his former seat of Longman at the 2010 federal election. That would have meant securing preselection from the LNP in order to have a good chance of reclaiming the seat. He also criticised the party leading up to the 2010 election on its absence of policies, but he did not rule out running for his resident seat of Fisher against Peter Slipper, a National party member who had joined the Liberals.

===Federal politics and diary allegations===
In 2006, Brough was the Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Faced with allegations regarding the degradation of Aboriginal communities and frequent cases of child sexual abuse, Brough, combined with the Northern Territory Chief Minister Clare Martin, commissioned a report into child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory. This report received much criticism, beginning with the view that it was a hasty reaction to these allegations. Researchers have suggested that the report was not simply used as an opportunity to resolve these issues, but rather as another way to control these communities.

In mid-2012, following the defection of Peter Slipper from the Liberals to become an independent MP and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Brough announced that he was seeking LNP preselection for the seat of Fisher for the 2013 federal election. On 29 July 2012, it was announced that had won the preselection for the seat, despite criticism over his contact with James Ashby. Ashby had been an adviser to Slipper who had made accusation of sexual harassment. Justice Steve Rares found that Brough had acted with Ashby and another Slipper staffer, Karen Doane, in abusing the judicial process for the &quot;purpose of causing significant public, reputational and political damage to Mr Slipper&quot;. On 9 October 2012, Slipper resigned as Speaker following revelations of mobile phone text messages he had sent to Ashby. In an early 2014 appeal ruling the full bench of the Federal Court found that Justice Rares had &quot;no basis to conclude that Brough was part of any combination with anyone in respect to the commencement of these proceedings with the predominant purpose of damaging Slipper in the way alleged or at all&quot;, and that there was &quot;nothing untoward about those matters&quot;.

In March 2013, Brough was the subject of controversy after posting a mock menu ahead of a Liberal Party fundraiser, which included an obscene characterisation of the body of then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Gillard and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd subsequently called for Brough to be disendorsed; Opposition Leader Tony Abbott condemned the comments but stated that Brough should not be disendorsed.

On 29 December 2015 Brough stood down from the Turnbull Ministry and moved to the backbench pending the completion of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police over the alleged copying of the diary of former speaker Peter Slipper. Jamie Briggs also resigned on the same day. Questions were raised over the holiday timing of the announcements.

On 13 February 2016, Brough resigned from the Ministry. On 26 February he announced that he would not recontest the seat of Fisher, concluding that it was &quot;a privilege and an honour&quot; to represent the electorate.

<doc id="559149" wikidata="Q4772190" url="?curid=559149" title="Anthony Byrne (politician)">
<text>Anthony Michael Byrne (born 1 December 1962) is a former Australian politician. A member of the Australian Labor Party in the Australian House of Representatives, he was one of federal parliament&#x27;s longest-serving members, having first entered Parliament in November 1999, representing the Division of Holt in Victoria. He was forced to resign as the deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security providing oversight of Australia&#x27;s security services after he made admissions of corruption and branch-stacking at Victoria&#x27;s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission and did not re-contest the subsequent 2022 federal election.

==Early life==
Byrne was born in Adelaide and spent his early childhood in Kalgoorlie, where he was educated at local schools and through the School of the Air. His high school education was completed at Christian Brothers College, Adelaide. His maternal grandfather was wounded in the Battle of Pozières.

Before entering parliament, he worked as CEO of Anxiety Disorders Foundation of Australia. Byrne joined the Labor Party in 1989, later serving an adviser to Senator Jacinta Collins.

==Parliamentary career==
Bryne was pre-selected by the ALP as their candidate for the 1999 Holt by-election in a &quot;full-scale factional battle&quot;, winning with the backing of the SDA trade union. Byrne won the by-election, becoming &quot;the last person elected to this federal parliament in the last century and the first to give an inaugural speech in the next&quot;.

His seat was mostly considered &quot;a relatively safe Labor electorate&quot;. Byrne has become an increasingly strident advocate for the need to &quot;safeguard the Australian people against foreign influence threats&quot;. 
He was Parliamentary Secretary for Trade from February 2009 until 14 September 2010. A strong supporter of the trade union movement, he has a personal allegiance to the Shop Assistants Union. Byrne stood strongly against the WorkChoices legislation of the Howard government in 2005 and the Ensuring Integrity industrial reforms of the Morrison government in 2019 – both of which were defeated.

Following the 2010 election, Byrne was appointed chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and became deputy chair after the 2013 election.

In 2013, Byrne was considered for a portfolio in the Second Rudd Ministry.

In March 2022, Byrne announced he would not run for re-election that year and would retire from politics after the election.

===Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security===

Byrne has served on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security since 2005 and was described by a Sky News anchor as &#x27;one of the best brains on intelligence and national security&#x27; in the Australian parliament. As chair of PJCIS in 2013, Byrne along with Deputy Chair Philip Ruddock, warned of the effect of the government&#x27;s efficiency dividend on the operations of Australia&#x27;s intelligence and security agencies after tabling a PJCIS report in May 2013 covering the administration and finances of Australia&#x27;s six intelligence and security agencies in 2010–2011. Byrne likened the cuts to the US austerity measures which prompted warnings from US intelligence agencies, in the wake of the Boston bombings, that their ability to combat terrorism was at risk. Of the government&#x27;s efficiency dividend, Byrne said &quot;I find it frankly astonishing that these agencies would have been effectively sequestered from funding to perform their tasks&quot; and that cuts to the agencies&#x27; funding was &quot;disgraceful and it should be addressed&quot;.

Nine months after PJCIS&#x27;s release of its &quot;Report of the Inquiry into Potential Reforms of Australia&#x27;s National Security Legislation&quot; authored under Byrne&#x27;s term as chair, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the Abbott Cabinet had agreed to adopt almost all of the 41 recommendations included in the report in the face of heightened security fears over Australians engaged in fighting with terrorist groups overseas. Byrne went on the record as criticising the Abbott government&#x27;s delay in implementing the report&#x27;s recommendations as &quot;unconscionable&quot;, saying that legislation should have been brought before parliament much earlier.

Prior to changes being introduced, Byrne had been consistently critical of PJCIS&#x27;s lack of a remit over the Australian Federal Police, citing the lack of such a thing as a significant flaw in the oversight powers of the committee. Byrne argued that as the intelligence and law enforcement agencies had been advising the government of the need for them to receive greater powers which may have had the potential to impinge on civil liberties and democratic freedoms, that the PJCIS should be given the appropriate oversight capacity to make inquiries on the behalf of the public for them to have confidence in the use of additional powers for these agencies.

After the PJCIS handed down its 36 recommendations on the government&#x27;s controversial foreign fighter&#x27;s legislation, Byrne appeared on Sky News&#x27; The Dalley Edition to clarify the committee&#x27;s position on the intrusiveness of some aspects of the legislation such as provisions for the lowering of the thresholds for agencies to access preventive detention orders, control orders, and questioning and detention powers, arguing that they needed to be counterbalanced by safeguards, most important of which would be sunset clauses.

Byrne also gave an interview to journalist David Speers in the aftermath of the Lindt Cafe Siege where he called for an independent judicial inquiry into the events leading up to and during the crisis which would have coercive and subpoena powers to summons any public official or minister to give evidence on the incident to regain public confidence in authorities.

In the wake of another terror attack on police in 2015, Byrne questioned why national leaders were reaching out to the Islamic community but weren&#x27;t doing the same with police; arguing for greater attention to be given to police facing the ongoing threat of street-side executions. After Muslim constituents with relatives affected by fighting in the Middle East had asked him why the coalition was taking so long to defeat IS, with an absence of a substantial victory and the appearance that the conflict was being lost despite claims that the coalition were gaining some advantages over IS, Byrne told ABC News that Australia required &quot;a complete, cohesive, clear strategy, a cogent strategy..with some form of timeframe to how to deal with these people&quot;.

During the 2016 federal election, Byrne began distributing flyers promoting law-and-order and an anti-terrorism platform; the first politician of the campaign to inject law-and-order into the national debate. Byrne said that he was prompted to distribute the flyers after many people in his electorate were too afraid to open their doors and talk to him while he was door-knocking due to recent gang activity and fear of violent Ice users, something which Byrne call &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; and promised that, if re-elected, one of his first orders of business would be to work with authorities to crush the Apex gang in his region and to ensure ice manufacturers and dealers are put out of business.

After the 2016 election, Crikey reported that Byrne was likely to be departing PJCIS, however later the same publication reported that Byrne would be remaining on the committee after being prevailed on to reverse his decision to leave.

Byrne has continued as the deputy chair for the PJCIS in the 46th Parliament of Australia. Along with other ALP colleagues Mike Kelly and Kimberley Kitching, Byrne has been a strong advocate to shift political attention to &quot;focusing on national resilience as much as military threats&quot;. During this time, some commentators would describe Byrne as a national security hawk.

Working with the chair of the committee, Andrew Hastie, Byrne is known to have exerted strong pressure on the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Dominic Raab, persuading him to re-consider the UK&#x27;s decision to allow Huawei to provide for their 5G network. It&#x27;s known he had challenged the Foreign Secretary on the matter in February 2020, saying, &quot;How would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks? That&#x27;s how we feel about Huawei.&quot; By May, Boris Johnson had announced that the UK would reduce the Chinese tech company&#x27;s involvement &quot;to zero&quot;. Stephen Conroy, who had overseen broadband roll out in Australia in 2011, indicated that Bryne and Hastie had played a pivotal role in the UK&#x27;s decision.

===Rudd-Gillard leadership contest===

During the Rudd-Gillard years, Byrne was described as &quot;a key Rudd backer&quot; and Rudd&#x27;s &quot;loyal lieutenant&quot;. On the day of Rudd&#x27;s February 2012 challenge for the leadership of the Labor Party against Julia Gillard, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; published an article by Bryne in which he detailed his reasons for supporting Kevin Rudd to be re-installed as Prime Minister. In a show of solidarity within the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, Byrne appeared alongside fellow Labor MP Richard Marles in an interview on the Australian breakfast television program &quot;Sunrise&quot; following Rudd&#x27;s unsuccessful challenge against Gillard to call for an end to divisions within the Labor caucus and a renewed concentration on governing the country.

===Taxi and hire car industry===

Byrne has been named as &quot;one of the few MPs at either federal or state level to have voiced support for licence-holders&quot;.
At a taxi rally in Narre Warren on 18 October 2015, attended by more than 300 people, Byrne heavily criticised the then technically illegal and unregulated ride-sharing service for undercutting the taxi industry. Byrne was reported to have said that &quot;behind every taxi is a family&quot;, and that &quot;In contrast to taxi and hire car operators, Uber has not been complying with a number of State and Federal government laws, regulations and taxes.&quot; Byrne rejected the idea that Uber provided a ride-sharing service and argued the company needed to be governed by the same rules as taxis. Additionally, Byrne said that &quot;If Uber does become properly regulated and the value of taxi licences and plates are reduced then the taxi industry should be appropriately compensated.&quot; Concluding, Byrne said that &quot;Our community needs to understand that behind every taxi is a family. We can&#x27;t just stand by and wait as an industry that employs nearly 200,000 people goes to the wall.&quot;

===IBAC investigation===
Byrne has been a target of investigations by Victoria&#x27;s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission known as IBAC. He has been a person of interest into matters around allegations of branch stacking in Victoria.

IBAC is holding public hearings into allegations of serious corrupt conduct involving Victorian public officers, including Members of Parliament. The hearings are part of Operation Watts, a coordinated investigation between IBAC and the Victorian Ombudsman, which is looking into a range of matters including allegations of &#x27;branch stacking&#x27; aired in media reports in 2020. Those media reports substantially comprised surreptitious recordings made by Byrne&#x27;s staffer Alexandra Stalder.

On the first day of hearing on 11 October 2021, Byrne admitted to branch stacking. He said he had been paying for other people&#x27;s party memberships fees since 1999, forking up to $2,000 of his own money in a single year.

== Personal life ==
Anthony Byrne has been married and divorced twice with two children from his first marriage. He supports the Collingwood Football Club. A long-time resident in Endeavour Hills in the electorate of Holt, Byrne lived outside his electorate in the neighbouring electorate of La Trobe, prior to moving to Southbank, in inner-city Melbourne.

<doc id="559155" wikidata="Q6824327" url="?curid=559155" title="Metric modulation">
<text>In music, metric modulation is a change in pulse rate (tempo) and/or pulse grouping (subdivision) which is derived from a note value or grouping heard before the change. Examples of metric modulation may include changes in time signature across an unchanging tempo, but the concept applies more specifically to shifts from one time signature/tempo (metre) to another, wherein a note value from the first is made equivalent to a note value in the second, like a pivot or bridge. The term &quot;modulation&quot; invokes the analogous and more familiar term in analyses of tonal harmony, wherein a pitch or pitch interval serves as a bridge between two keys. In both terms, the pivoting value functions differently before and after the change, but sounds the same, and acts as an audible common element between them. Metric modulation was first described by Richard Franko Goldman while reviewing the Cello Sonata of Elliott Carter, who prefers to call it tempo modulation. Another synonymous term is proportional tempi.

==Determination of the new tempo==
The following formula illustrates how to determine the tempo before or after a metric modulation, or, alternatively, how many of the associated note values will be in each measure before or after the modulation:
:formula_1

Thus if the two half notes in time at a tempo of quarter note = 84 are made equivalent with three half notes at a new tempo, that tempo will be:

:formula_2
Example taken from Carter&#x27;s &quot;Eight Etudes and a Fantasy&quot; for woodwind quartet (1950), Fantasy, mm. 16-17.

Note that this tempo, quarter note = 126, is equal to dotted-quarter note = 84 (( = ) = ( = )).

A tempo (or metric) modulation causes a change in the hierarchical relationship between the perceived beat subdivision and all potential subdivisions belonging to the new tempo. Benadon has explored some compositional uses of tempo modulations, such as tempo networks and beat subdivision spaces.

Three challenges arise when performing metric modulations:
#Grouping notes of the same speed differently on each side of the barline, ex: (quintuplet =sextuplet ) with sixteenth notes before and after the barline
#Subdivision used on one side of the barline and not the other, ex: (triplet =) with triplets before and quarter notes after the barline
#Subdivision used on neither side of the barline but used to establish the modulation, ex: (quintuplet =) with quarter notes before and after the barline

Examples of the use of metric modulation include Carter&#x27;s Cello Sonata (1948), &quot;A Symphony of Three Orchestras&quot; (1976), and Björk&#x27;s &quot;Desired Constellation&quot; (=).
Beethoven used metric modulation in his Trio for 2 oboes &amp; English horn, Op. 87, 1794.
== Score notation ==
Metric modulations are generally notated as &#x27;note value&#x27; = &#x27;note value&#x27;. For example,

This notation is also normally followed by the new tempo in parentheses.

Before the modern concept and notation of metric modulations composers used the terms &quot;doppio piu mosso&quot; and &quot;doppio piu lento&quot; for double and half-speed, and later markings such as:

:(Adagio)=(Allegro)

indicating double speed, which would now be marked (=).

The phrase &quot;l&#x27;istesso tempo&quot; was used for what may now be notated with metric modulation markings. For example: to (), will be marked &quot;l&#x27;istesso tempo&quot;, indicating the beat is the same speed.

<doc id="559157" wikidata="Q504337" url="?curid=559157" title="Andrew Cyrille">
<text>Andrew Charles Cyrille (born November 10, 1939) is an American avant-garde jazz drummer. Throughout his career, he has performed both as a leader and a sideman in the bands of Walt Dickerson and Cecil Taylor, among others. AllMusic biographer Chris Kelsey wrote: &quot;Few free-jazz drummers play with a tenth of Cyrille&#x27;s grace and authority. His energy is unflagging, his power absolute, tempered only by an ever-present sense of propriety.&quot;

==Life and career==
Cyrille was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States, into a Haitian family. He began studying science at St. John&#x27;s University, but was already playing jazz in the evenings and switched his studies to the Juilliard School. His first drum teachers were fellow Brooklyn-based drummers Willie Jones and Lenny McBrowne; through them, Cyrille met Max Roach. Nonetheless, Cyrille became a disciple of Philly Joe Jones.

His first professional engagement was as an accompanist of singer Nellie Lutcher, and he had an early recording session with Coleman Hawkins. Trumpeter Ted Curson introduced him to pianist Cecil Taylor when Cyrille was 18.

He joined the Cecil Taylor unit in 1965, and worked with Taylor over a period of 15 years. He later formed a musical partnership with Milford Graves, and the two recorded a drum duet album in 1974. In addition to recording as a bandleader, he has recorded and/or performed with musicians including David Murray, Irène Schweizer, Marilyn Crispell, Carla Bley, Butch Morris and Reggie Workman. Cyrille was a member of the group, Trio 3, with Oliver Lake and Reggie Workman.

<text>Michael Keith Organ (born 22 September 1956) is a former Australian politician and archivist. He was an Australian Greens member of the Australian House of Representatives between 2002 and 2004, representing the Division of Cunningham, New South Wales. He was the first member of the Greens to win a seat in the House of Representatives, having won a by-election which the Liberal Party did not contest.

==Life and education==
Organ was born in Bulli, New South Wales. His mother was a hospital domestic and his father was a brickworker. He studied geology at the University of Wollongong and completed a post-graduate diploma in archive administration at the University of New South Wales, where he subsequently took up a post as an archivist. He was employed at the University of Wollongong library, as an archivist (1996–2002) and, , manager, repository services until 1 November 2020.

Three months prior to the Cunningham by-election, he unsuccessfully contested the local government election for the lord mayoralship of Wollongong.

In 2005, Organ discovered a print of the 1927 film Metropolis containing missing scenes. This print was used to create a restored version of the film, which re-premiered in 2010.

He has four children, Andrew (b. 1991), Kyle (b. 1993), India (b. 2008) and Emma (b. 2011).

==Electoral history==

===Cunningham by-election===

The federal division of Cunningham has been a safe Labor seat since its creation in 1949. On 16 August 2002, the sitting member, Dr Stephen Martin, unexpectedly resigned, causing a by-election.

The ALP preselected a TAFE teacher, Sharon Bird, by decision of the party executive rather than the usual rank-and-file nomination procedure, and the Liberal party opted not to contest the by-election.

Organ was endorsed by the South Coast Labour Council and received strong preference flows from two popular independent candidates, David Moulds and Peter Wilson. He gained 23% of the primary vote and 52% after allocation of preferences, defeating Bird and becoming the first Green elected to the House of Representatives, at the same time making Cunningham a marginal seat.

During his term, he was one of three Greens federal parliamentarians (with Senator Bob Brown and Senator Kerry Nettle).

===Subsequent elections===
Organ ran for a full term as member for Cunningham in the 2004 general election. He received 20.1% of the primary vote, placing third behind the Labor (39.6%) and Liberal (28.8%) candidates. This was a swing of 13.5% to the Greens compared to the 2001 federal election, but a 2.9% swing away from Organ compared to the 2002 by-election. Organ was eliminated on the ninth count, with his voters&#x27; preferences flowing overwhelmingly to Labor&#x27;s Sharon Bird, allowing her to win with a 61.5% two-party-preferred vote.

He was again selected as the Greens candidate for Cunningham in the 2007 federal election, but failed to regain the seat from Bird, who was re-elected on first preferences. Organ won 14.6% of the primary vote.

For the 2022 election, Organ was preselected as Greens candidate for rural New South Wales seat of Riverina. The seat is a change from the coast, centred on the agricultural region of Riverina, including the towns Wagga Wagga and Parkes.

==Political positions==

===Sandon Point===
In his first speech, Organ credited his win to community opposition to a planned development by the Stockland Trust Group at Sandon Point. The campaign included a tent embassy by the local Dharawal nation centred around the burial site of the Kuradji (similar to a shaman), and a community blockade of around 300 people which was confronted by a force of around sixty police officers and police dogs. Organ said that the development was inappropriate, threatened European and Indigenous cultural heritage, threatened wetlands and a green corridor.

===Economy===
Organ supports free tertiary education and opposes the privatisation of public utilities like Telstra, as well as what he calls &quot;two decades of Canberra&#x27;s obsession with economic rationalism&quot;.

===Iraq war===
In his first speech, Organ condemned the Iraq War as unjust, in breach of United Nations resolutions, and likely to lead to higher risks of terrorism.

===Tibet===
Organ co-authored a Greens policy on Tibet, which supported the right of Tibetans to self-determination and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Middle Way approach. He participated to the Save Tibet Asia Pacific Forum in Tokyo on 1–3 July 2008.

===Marriage Equality===
Organ was the only member of the House of Representatives to propose anti-discrimination amendments to the Howard Government&#x27;s amendments to the Marriage Act in 2004.

<doc id="559162" wikidata="Q366233" url="?curid=559162" title="Milford Graves">
<text>Milford Graves (August 20, 1941 – February 12, 2021) was an American jazz drummer, percussionist, Professor Emeritus of Music, researcher/inventor, visual artist/sculptor, gardener/herbalist, and martial artist. Graves was noteworthy for his early avant-garde contributions in the 1960s with Paul Bley, Albert Ayler, and the New York Art Quartet, and is considered to be a free jazz pioneer, liberating percussion from its timekeeping role. The composer and saxophonist John Zorn referred to Graves as &quot;basically a 20th-century shaman.&quot;

==Early life==
Graves was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, on August 20, 1941. He began playing drums when he was three years old, and was introduced to the congas at age eight. He also studied timbales and African hand drumming at an early age. By the early 1960s, he was leading dance bands and playing in Latin/Afro Cuban ensembles in New York on bills alongside Cal Tjader and Herbie Mann. His group, the Milford Graves Latino Quintet, included saxophonist Pete Yellin, pianist Chick Corea, bassist Lisle Atkinson, and conga player Bill Fitch.

==Career==
In 1962, Graves heard the John Coltrane quartet with Elvin Jones, whose drumming made a strong impression. The following year, Graves acquired a standard drum set from pianist Hal Galper and began using it regularly. That summer, percussionist Don Alias invited Graves to Boston for a residency, and Graves began playing with saxophonist Giuseppi Logan.

During a visit to New York in 1964, Logan introduced Graves to trombonist Roswell Rudd and saxophonist John Tchicai. Graves &quot;wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet.&quot; Rudd recalled that Graves&#x27;s &quot;playing was like an anti-gravity vortex, in which you could either float or fly depending on your impulse.&quot; According to Tchicai, &quot;Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that, at that time, we hadn&#x27;t heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in polyrhythms or the same sense of intensity and musicality.&quot; Tchicai also stated that Don Moore, the original New York Art Quartet bassist, &quot;became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn&#x27;t be true or possible and therefore refused to play with us.&quot;

That same year, Graves also participated in the &quot;October Revolution in Jazz&quot; organized by Bill Dixon, and appeared on a number of recordings, including the New York Art Quartet&#x27;s self-titled debut album, Giuseppi Logan&#x27;s debut album, which also featured pianist Don Pullen and bassist Eddie Gómez, Paul Bley&#x27;s &quot;Barrage&quot;, Montego Joe&#x27;s &quot;Arriba! Con Montego Joe&quot; (which also featured Chick Corea and Gómez), and the Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Communication&quot;. Graves also briefly played with Albert Ayler&#x27;s trio, which included bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, as a second drummer. This combination of musicians inspired John Coltrane to add Rashied Ali as a second drummer the following year.

In 1965, Graves continued to expand his horizons, studying the tabla with Wasantha Singh and recording with Miriam Makeba on &quot;Makeba Sings!&quot;. He also recorded and released a percussion album titled &quot;Percussion Ensemble&quot;, which featured drummer Sonny Morgan. Val Wilmer wrote that the recording &quot;remains just about the most brilliantly conceived and executed percussion album to date.&quot; That year, Graves also recorded on the New York Art Quartet&#x27;s second album &quot;Mohawk&quot;, on Montego Joe&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wild &amp; Warm&quot;, on Lowell Davidson&#x27;s sole release, and on a second album with Giuseppi Logan, again working with Don Pullen. Graves and Pullen soon formed a duo, and in 1966 they recorded and released &quot;In Concert at Yale University&quot;, followed by &quot;Nommo&quot;, on their SRP (&quot;Self Reliance Project&quot;) label.

Graves joined Albert Ayler&#x27;s band in 1967, replacing Beaver Harris. The group performed at Slugs&#x27; Saloon, at the Newport Jazz Festival, and, on July 21, at John Coltrane&#x27;s funeral. (Recordings of this performance were released in 2004 on the compilation &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;.) Later that year, the group recorded &quot;Love Cry&quot;. Graves left Ayler&#x27;s band when Impulse! began pushing Ayler in a more commercial direction.

Graves recorded &quot;Black Woman&quot; with Sonny Sharrock in the late 1960s and began playing with drummers Andrew Cyrille and Rashied Ali on a series of concerts titled &quot;Dialogue of the Drums.&quot; Graves and Cyrille also recorded and released an album without Ali and with the title &quot;Dialogue of the Drums&quot; in 1974. During this time, Graves studied to become a medical technician and managed a lab for a veterinarian. In 1973, Bill Dixon helped secure Graves a teaching position at Bennington College, where Graves taught until 2012. (Dixon had previously brought Jimmy Lyons, Jimmy Garrison, Alan Shorter, and Alan Silva to Bennington.) In 1977, Graves released two albums under his own name: &quot;Bäbi&quot;, which featured reed players Arthur Doyle and Hugh Glover, and &quot;Meditation Among Us&quot;, with a Japanese jazz quartet composed of Kaoru Abe, Toshinori Kondo, Mototeru Takagi, and Toshiyuki Tsuchitori. During the early 1980s, Graves also began working with dancer Min Tanaka.

=== Later ===
In the years that followed, Graves toured and recorded in a quartet setting with drummers Cyrille, Kenny Clarke, and Famoudou Don Moye, recorded a duo album with David Murray, and performed and recorded with the New York Art Quartet in celebration of their 35th anniversary. He also recorded two solo albums, &quot;Grand Unification&quot; (1998) and &quot;Stories&quot; (2000), as well as albums with John Zorn, Anthony Braxton, William Parker, and Bill Laswell. In 2008 and 2012, Graves performed with Lou Reed. In 2017, Graves played on Sam Amidon&#x27;s album &quot;The Following Mountain&quot;. 2018 saw Graves performing with bassist Shahzad Ismaily, as well as the release of the documentary &quot;Milford Graves Full Mantis&quot;, directed by Graves&#x27;s former student, Jake Meginsky, along with Neil Cloaca Young. In 2019, Graves played in a duo setting with pianist Jason Moran. Alice in Chains vocalist William DuVall also directed a documentary about Graves titled &quot;Ancient to Future: The Wisdom of Milford Graves.&quot; However, the film has been in post-production status since 2013 and has not been released as of 2020.

In 2022, Black Editions Group announced that their Black Editions Archive imprint would focus on releasing previously unheard recordings by Graves.

==Illness and death==
Graves was diagnosed with amyloid cardiomyopathy in 2018, and was informed he had half a year more to live. He died on February 12, 2021. He was 79, and suffered from congestive heart failure prior to his death.

== Honors, awards, distinctions ==
Graves was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Music Composition in 2000,
and in 2015 he received a Doris Duke Foundation Impact Award.

==Musical style==
Graves, along with Sunny Murray and Rashied Ali, was one of the first jazz musicians to free the drums from their traditional time-keeping role, having developed &quot;a conception of... music that went beyond jazz and the ching-a-ding of the ride cymbal.&quot; Val Wilmer described Graves as
...a percussionist with an amazing technique. Graves moved around his drumset with astonishing speed, beating rapid two-handed tattoos on every surface. Each stroke was clearly defined so that there were no rolls in the conventional sense; the emphasis was on clarity. He used his cymbals in the way another drummer might use a gong or another drum. With the NYAQ, Graves&#x27;s snare drum was tuned high as was the norm, but already his tom-toms were producing a deeper sound than usual. By the end of the &#x27;sixties, though, he had dispensed with the snare and his three tom-toms were tuned as loosely as is common in rock today... Graves was probably the first American drummer to remove all of his bottom heads because of their tendency to absorb sound.
Wilmer also wrote:
His bass drum... is in frequent use, and he habitually holds his sticks by the tip... Graves was using matched grip before it became fashionable, and he has another unique grip which enables him to hold two sticks and play on two surfaces virtually simultaneously. Sometimes he holds a huge mallet or maracas in the same hand as a regular drumstick, beating with this combination on the same surface or switching alternately from one beater to the other. He occasionally takes a small pair of tuned bongoes, places them in front of him on the skin of one tom-tom and hits them in that position. The result is a percussive maelstrom of multi-layered intensity.
John Szwed wrote that Graves &quot;did not use a standard drum setup and sometimes hit the bass drum with a stick or kicked it instead of using a pedal, or he played the snare with a tree branch with the leaves still intact.&quot;

Graves believed that &quot;most drummers are over-occupied with the playing of rhythms and insufficiently with the actual sound,&quot; and that it is &quot;important for drummers to study the actual membrane, to try for different sounds or a different feeling by playing on every part of the skin and not merely the same area over and over again...&quot; He stated that &quot;[i]f you know how to manipulate your skins, you can make that dispersed sound - slides, portamento style, sustained tone. Instead of letting your stick free rebound, you can mute it, slide it on there. It calls for greater physicality.&quot; Graves told Aakash Mittal: &quot;when I play, I do more than vertical strokes. I&#x27;m not just &quot;bah-bop bah-bop.&quot; My thing is moving around, touching the skins, knowing about momentum and position at the same time.&quot; In an interview with Paul Burwell, Graves stated: &quot;I relate the drum skin to a body of water... As a musician, you are schooling yourself to deal with some of the most sensitive things in the universe: emotion, frequency, life, the vital force... we&#x27;re involved with one of the most subtle things in life. Sounds - that&#x27;s it!&quot;

Graves was also very outspoken about his feelings concerning the role of the drummer: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t understand how a guy would sit and play a basic beat all the time. In African drumming, the drum is in the forefront. Timekeeping for the drummer? I said no way.&quot; He stated: &quot;You just can&#x27;t stay in the background; that&#x27;s not the nature of the instrument. Most drummers are so reduced. And one of the most disrespectful things the drummer can encounter is when they put the drums either in the right or left side corner of the stage, or if they put you there, they&#x27;ve got people in front of you.&quot; He suggested that drummers not take &quot;a greater or lesser role, but an equal role... Not reducing yourself to the point that you were considered just a drummer, not a musician. I resented that more than anything.&quot;

==Non-musical interests==
Graves pursued a wide variety of non-musical interests. According to Giovanni Russonello, Graves was &quot;a kind of underground thought leader in martial arts, natural healing and cellular biology,&quot; preferring to &quot;live in territory that&#x27;s uncharted, which often means unseen,&quot; reflecting what John Corbett called &quot;an axiom of adaptability, a sense that people need to be flexible to deal with new contexts and new challenges.&quot; Writing in Artforum, Christoph Cox stated: &quot;Graves has thrown himself into a massive multidisciplinary project that straddles the arts and sciences, traditional healing practices and the frontiers of cardiology and stem-cell research.&quot;

Many of Graves&#x27; interests revolved around what he called &quot;biological music, a synthesis of the physical and mental, a mind-body deal.&quot; One example is &quot;Yara,&quot; a form of martial art that Graves, a former Police Athletic League boxing champ, invented in the early 1970s, and that is &quot;spontaneous improvised, and... reacting according to that particular situation,&quot; based on &quot;the movements of the Praying Mantis, African ritual dance, and Lindy Hop.&quot; (According to Graves, Yara means &quot;nimbleness&quot; in the Yoruba language.) Graves stated that certain aspects of Yara came about as a result of inquiries into the history of martial arts having led him to its roots in nature: &quot;What is martial arts? What&#x27;s Kung Fu? Where did it come from...? I started reading books on Chinese martial arts, the history of this art... There was many times... when I was reading about this so called grandmaster - he&#x27;d be up in the mountains meditating, and he saw this and he saw that. I said, &#x27;wow - I could do the same thing, man. I&#x27;ll just go out in nature &#x27;cause that&#x27;s where they got it from...&#x27; So I went to the best teacher. I went to the praying mantis himself... It goes back to hanging out with nature.&quot; Graves taught Yara at his home for over thirty years, with sparring sessions that were &quot;hours long and full-contact.&quot;

Aakash Mittal noted the connections between Graves&#x27; martial arts activities and his music, writing: &quot;the kinetic motion of yara can be applied with sticks in hand to a cymbal, creating a sonification of the martial arts form itself.&quot; Graves explained: &quot;When I would spar, I&#x27;d sing on people! Put them to sleep. Just like on the trap set, one hand goes this way, the other that way. They never knew what was coming...&quot; &quot;I would get down to my drum set and I&#x27;d go — &quot;ting-raww—frapt!&quot; — I would keep that whole flow and go around. If I was doing a sword technique, I would practice my sword stuff and with the strokes like — &quot;thwap!&quot;... There I would exchange a stick, so if I&#x27;m hitting down here — &quot;pop!&quot; — and hitting the cymbal — &quot;shhhap!&quot;... I was directing the energy in a very precise, meaningful way, so they helped each other out. I would hit the sound and just get it, make it go like — &quot;rat-a-tat-a-rot-a-toko!&quot;&quot;

Graves related his martial arts activities to his interest in herbal healing, nutrition, acupuncture, and healing using sound and electrical impulses, stating &quot;When we test the body, or we grab the body, and hit certain points and grab certain points, you&#x27;re not doing a destructive touch... You&#x27;re a healing martial artist, a constructive martial artist, not a destructive martial artist... You just don&#x27;t want to be somebody who learns a martial art to go out and be a bully and hurt somebody. I think that&#x27;s wrong.&quot; Graves was &quot;established as both an herbalist and acupuncturist in New York City&quot; and was &quot;frequently sought out as a healer and acupuncturist by neighbors and artists across the city.&quot; For years he tended what he called a &quot;global garden,&quot; using it as a source of herbal remedies and nutritious foods. Graves recalled that his interest in maintaining a healthy lifestyle arose when, in his late teens, he began experiencing severe health problems as a result of regularly drinking cheap wine. He credited a drastic change in his diet with saving his life: &quot;The plants! The plants! I didn&#x27;t get into it cause someone said this is something you should do. It wasn&#x27;t no hip thing, man. It was necessity. It was illness. I became a vegetarian and I started hanging out, listening to the plants.&quot;

In the mid-1970s, Graves became fascinated by the notion of &quot;the heartbeat as a primary source of rhythm.&quot; He stumbled on a recording of heart rhythms, and &quot;was astonished by the similarities between cardiac arrhythmias and Afro-Cuban drumming patterns. Beyond the simple da-DUM of the heartbeat, he heard polyrhythmic pulsations, variable duration between beats, and a whole spectrum of frequencies. All this strengthened his conviction that true rhythm isn&#x27;t metronomic and that the tone of the beat is as important as its duration.&quot; He purchased equipment and wrote software that allowed him to record and analyze heartbeats, and began studying his own heartbeat rhythms as well as those of friends and other musicians. After decades of study, Graves used some of the funds from his 2000 Guggenheim Fellowship to purchase additional equipment and software. He wrote: &quot;Initially I recorded heartbeats through an electronic stethoscope and listened to the different patterns of those rhythms. More recently, the use of LabVIEW, a software program, has provided much more detailed data. LabVIEW allows me to record the voltages produced by the electrical pulses of the heart, essentially capturing the frequency at which the heart vibrates. These frequencies can then be translated into the audible spectrum and analyzed as sound (heart music), which is accomplished by using specific algorithms written for LabVIEW.&quot; By playing the resulting sounds back to a person who acted as a source, Graves &quot;found he can increase blood flow and possibly even stimulate cell growth.&quot; He wrote that this research &quot;has inspired a number of medical studies, including a collaboration with researcher Carlo Ventura which showed that exposure to the heart music caused unassigned stem cells to develop into myocardial (heart) cells.&quot; The work also resulted in a patent entitled &quot;Method and device for preparing non-embryonic stem cells.&quot; Dr. Baruch Krauss, who teaches at Harvard Medical School, is a physician at Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, and who studied acupuncture with Graves and followed his research, has described Graves as &quot;what a Renaissance man looks like today... Milford is right on the cutting edge of this stuff. He brings to it what doctors can&#x27;t, because he approaches it as a musician.&quot;

John Corbett wrote that &quot;Graves&#x27;s heart studies... confirm the falsity of one of the easiest potshots taken at nonmetrical or polymetrical drumming in free jazz, namely, that it&#x27;s unnatural and doesn&#x27;t mimic the heart, which is assumed to have a steady beat.&quot; Graves stated that regular rhythms are &quot;not natural. You have to go against all the rules of nature, use a metronome, inhibit your true ability to sense the rhythms and vibrations of nature. In a pure metric sense, that means that your inhalation and exhalation would always be the same, because when you inhale your beats per minute increases. If you exhale, it decreases. No one breathes that way. Breath varies, so cardiac rhythm never has that tempo. It&#x27;s always changing.&quot; He also stated: &quot;We are simply not making music that is up to our potential. The complexities you can hear in the sounds of one person&#x27;s heartbeat are very similar to free jazz and if we were to make music that was in tune with the vibrations of our bodies, the results would be very powerful.&quot;

Graves also painted artwork for some of his albums, and later exhibited sculptures which tie together his interests in music and martial arts, writing: &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking about sculpture as a teaching tool. There&#x27;s a saying I used to always hear: &#x27;sculpture is frozen music.&#x27; I want something with some kind of movement to it. I&#x27;m adding elements that are not static, like transducers. I also use my years and years of experience in music and my training in martial arts to understand sculpture. There were movements I used to do that would be very quiet, maybe something from aikido or tai chi. Very slow, very slow... then all of a sudden you would burst out with this explosive, passive-aggressive energy. I wondered how I would put that into a piece of sculpture. I thought the explosion would be to put together some unorthodox elements and have contradictions set in.

<text>Foreststorn &quot;Chico&quot; Hamilton (September 20, 1921 – November 25, 2013) was an American jazz drummer and bandleader. He came to prominence as sideman for Lester Young, Gerry Mulligan, Count Basie, and Lena Horne. Hamilton became a bandleader, first with a quintet featuring the cello as a lead instrument, an unusual choice for a jazz band in the 1950s, and subsequently leading bands that performed cool jazz, post bop, and jazz fusion.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and career ===
Foreststorn Hamilton was born in Los Angeles, California, one of three brothers, one of whom was actor Bernie Hamilton.

Hamilton started his career in a band with Charles Mingus, Illinois Jacquet, Ernie Royal, Dexter Gordon, Buddy Collette and Jack Kelso before he had finished high school. Engagements with Lionel Hampton, Slim &amp; Slam, T-Bone Walker, Lester Young, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Barnet, Billy Eckstine, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Billie Holiday, Gerry Mulligan and Lena Horne established his career.

Hamilton appeared in &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941) as part of the backing group supporting Fred Astaire. Hamilton also performed on the soundtrack of the Bing Crosby and Bob Hope film &quot;Road to Bali&quot; (1952).

=== Bandleader ===
He recorded his first album as leader in 1955 with George Duvivier (double bass) and Howard Roberts (guitar) for Pacific Jazz. In the same year Hamilton formed an unusual quintet in Los Angeles, featuring cello, flute/saxes/clarinet, guitar, bass and drums. The quintet has been described as one of the last important West Coast jazz bands.

The original personnel included flutist/saxophonist/clarinetist Buddy Collette, guitarist Jim Hall, cellist Fred Katz and bassist Jim Aton, who was later replaced by Carson Smith. Hamilton continued to tour, using different personnel, from 1957 to 1960. A version of the quintet including flutist Paul Horn was featured in the film &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (in which he has a small speaking role in a scene with Tony Curtis) in 1957 and one including Eric Dolphy appeared in the film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; (1960), set at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.

Hamilton revamped his group in 1961 with Charles Lloyd, Gábor Szabó, George Bohanon and Albert Stinson, playing what has been described as chamber jazz, with &quot;a moderate avant-gardism.&quot; The group recorded for Columbia, Reprise and Impulse Records and also recorded the soundtrack for the industrial film &quot;Litho&quot; in 1962, the first American film to be shown behind the Iron Curtain. Hamilton formed a commercial and film production company in 1965, and went on to score the feature films &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965), &quot;Mr. Ricco&quot; (1975), &quot;Coonskin&quot; (1975), &quot;By Design&quot; (1982), the television programs &quot;Portrait of Willie Mays&quot; and &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;, and scored hundreds of commercials for TV and radio.

In 1986 Hamilton formed his sextet Chico Hamilton and the Young Alto&#x27;s featuring Kenneth Lampl, Eric Person and Marc Bernstein. The group performed at the 1986 JVC Jazz Festival, the Apollo Theater, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

=== Later career ===
In 2001, Hamilton released &quot;Foreststorn&quot; featuring Euphoria with Cary DeNigris on guitar, Paul Ramsey on bass, Eric Lawrence on alto and soprano saxes and Evan Schwam on tenor sax, alongside notable guests. In August of that year, he performed &quot;My Funny Valentine: A Tribute to Chico Hamilton&quot; at Lincoln Center.

In 1997, Hamilton received the New School University Jazz and Contemporary Music Programs&#x27; &quot;Beacons in Jazz Award&quot; in recognition for his &quot;significant contribution to the evolution of Jazz&quot;. In 2002, he was awarded the WLIU-FM Radio Lifetime Achievement Award. At the IAJE in NYC January 2004, he was awarded a &quot;NEA Jazz Master Fellowship&quot;. In December 2006, Congress confirmed the nomination of Hamilton to the President&#x27;s Council on the Arts. In 2007, he received a &quot;Living Legend Jazz Award&quot; as part of The Kennedy Center&#x27;s Jazz in Our Time Festival, as well as being awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts from The New School.

In 2006, Hamilton released &quot;Joyous Shout!&quot; in celebration of his 85th birthday. In 2007, he released &quot;Hamiltonia&quot;, sampling his original compositions from the four albums released in 2006. Over the years, Hamilton had a series of dance successes, including his signature song &quot;Conquistadors&quot; from his 1960s Impulse album &quot;El Chico&quot;, and the Brazilian-influenced song &quot;Strut&quot; from his 1980 Elektra album, &quot;Nomad&quot;.

In 2002, a track titled &quot;For Mods Only&quot; from his 1966 Impulse! Records album &quot;The Dealer&quot;, was included on the Thievery Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Sounds from the Verve Hi-Fi&quot;. In 2006, Rong Music released the 12-inch vinyl &quot;Kerry&#x27;s Caravan&quot; by Mudd and Hamilton, with remixes from Ray Mang. Several remixes of Hamilton&#x27;s recordings were released in the late 2000s. He released &quot;Twelve Tones of Love&quot; on Joyous Shout! in 2009. In March 2011, he had a long recording session, resulting in 28 new tracks with his Euphoria group. Following a health setback in 2010, he and the group began weekly rehearsals at Hamilton&#x27;s Penthouse A; which brought together the material which would comprise &quot;Revelation&quot;, an 11-track CD, released in 2011. For the Dutch Radio Westerwolde he made a Radio Jingle for The Toppyjazz Radio Show.

==Death==
Hamilton died aged 92 on November 25, 2013, in Manhattan.

<text>Roy Owen Haynes (March 13, 1925 – November 12, 2024) was an American jazz drummer. In the 1950s he was given the nickname &quot;Snap Crackle&quot; for his distinctive snare drum sound and musical vocabulary. He was among the most recorded drummers in jazz. In a career spanning over eight decades, he played swing, bebop, jazz fusion, and avant-garde jazz. He is considered to have been a pioneer of jazz drumming.

Haynes led bands, including the Hip Ensemble. His albums &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot; and &quot;Whereas&quot; were nominated for a Grammy Award. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Career==

Haynes was born in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, to Gustavas and Edna Haynes, immigrants from Barbados. His younger brother, Michael E. Haynes, became an important leader in the African American community in Massachusetts, working with Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement, representing Roxbury in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and for forty years serving as pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church. King had been a member at the church while he pursued his doctoral degree at Boston University.

Haynes made his professional debut in 1942 in Boston and began his full-time professional career in 1945. From 1947 to 1949 he worked with saxophonist Lester Young, and from 1949 to 1952 was a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker&#x27;s quintet. He also recorded at the time with pianist Bud Powell and saxophonists Wardell Gray and Stan Getz. From 1953 to 1958, he toured with singer Sarah Vaughan and recorded with her. In the 1950s he was given the nickname &quot;Snap Crackle&quot;. In the 1960s, he was a member of the John Coltrane Quartet, often working as a sub for drummer Elvin Jones. In 1990, he co-led the album &quot;Question and Answer&quot; with Pat Metheny. Haynes led bands including the Hip Ensemble.

A tribute song was recorded by Jim Keltner and Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, and he appeared on stage with the Allman Brothers Band in 2006 and Page McConnell of Phish in 2008. &quot;Age seems to have just passed him by,&quot; Watts observed. &quot;He&#x27;s eighty-three and in 2006 he was voted Best Contemporary Jazz Drummer [in &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine&quot;&#x27;s&quot; readers&#x27; poll]. He&#x27;s amazing.&quot;
In 2008, Haynes voiced a DJ for the fictional classic jazz radio station, Jazz Nation Radio 108.5 on the open-world video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;. His last album, &quot;Roy-Alty&quot;, was released in 2011.

==Personal life==
His son Graham Haynes is a cornetist; another son Craig Holiday Haynes and grandson Marcus Gilmore are both drummers.

Haynes was known to celebrate his birthdays on stage and in later years at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City. His 95th birthday celebration in 2020 was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On November 12, 2024, following a short illness, Haynes died at the age of 99 in Nassau County, New York, on the South Shore of Long Island.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;A Life in Time –&quot; &quot;The Roy Haynes Story&quot; was named by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine as one of the Best Boxed Sets of 2007 and was nominated for an award by the Jazz Journalist&#x27;s Association. WKCR-FM, New York, surveyed Haynes&#x27;s career in 301 hours of programming, January 11–23, 2009. &quot;Esquire&quot; named Roy Haynes one of the best-dressed men in America in 1960, along with Fred Astaire, Miles Davis, Clark Gable, and Cary Grant.
In 1994 Haynes was awarded the Danish Jazzpar Prize, and in 1996 the French government knighted him with the Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France&#x27;s top literary and artistic honor. In 1995, the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts named Haynes as a NEA Jazz Master. Haynes received honorary doctorates from the Berklee College of Music (1991), and the New England Conservatory of Music (2004), as well as a Peabody Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University, in 2012. He was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine Hall of Fame in 2004. On October 9, 2010, he was awarded the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation&#x27;s BNY Mellon Jazz Living Legacy Award at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. In 2001, Haynes&#x27;s album &quot;Birds of a Feather: A Tribute to Charlie Parker&quot; was nominated for the 44th Annual Grammy Awards as Best Jazz Instrumental Album.

<text>James Harvey Kennedy (born May 25, 1970) is an American actor and comedian.

In film, Kennedy is best known for his role as Randy Meeks in the &quot;Scream&quot; film series (1996–2000), which saw him as a supporting character in the first and third installments and a lead ensemble member in the second installment. He has also had lead roles in &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2003), &quot;Son of the Mask&quot; (2005), &quot;Kickin&#x27; It Old Skool&quot; (2007), &quot;Finding Bliss&quot; (2009), and &quot;Trick&quot; (2019). He has had notable supporting roles in films such as &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999), &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), &quot;Boiler Room&quot; (2000), &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move&quot; (2001), and &quot;Good Deeds&quot; (2012).

In television, Kennedy is known for hosting the WB sketch comedy series &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot; (2002–2004) and his main cast roles as Professor Eli James on the CBS series &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; (2008–2010) and Dr. Callahan on the NBC medical comedy-drama series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (2016). He has had recurring voice roles on the Fox sitcom &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2009–2013), the Nickelodeon series &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot; (2009–2014), and the Comedy Central sitcom &quot;Legends of Chamberlain Heights&quot; (2016–2017).

==Early life==
Kennedy was born on May 25, 1970, in Upper Darby Township, a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Kennedy was raised Catholic. He attended and graduated from Monsignor Bonner High School in 1988. After high school, Kennedy began his career as a Hollywood extra.

== Career ==

When Kennedy first arrived in Los Angeles, he became a professional Hollywood extra.

After a few years of struggling, Kennedy was unable to find an agent and worked as a host at Red Lobster. He auditioned for over 80 commercials and could not book one. He then took a job as a telemarketer and learned that he had a talent for selling things. Kennedy then thought that if he could sell anything, &quot;why not sell myself?&quot;, becoming his own agent.

Kennedy created a false persona, screen agent &quot;Marty Power&quot;, to attract the attention of real agents and managers over the phone, who would later book his performances. He came to prominence in the late 1990s for playing Randy Meeks in the &quot;Scream&quot; film series. His lead role as Tim Avery in &quot;Son of the Mask&quot; earned him a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor, he would later voice his experiences with the film on his YouTube channel years after the film&#x27;s release. The film would also go on to inspire Kennedy to host the 2007 documentary &quot;Heckler&quot; after feeling hurt by the film&#x27;s poor reception in which some reviewers attacked him personally.

Kennedy formed a production company called Wannabe Producers, alongside Josh through which he has produced the shows &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot;, &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up&quot;, &quot;The Starlet&quot;, and &quot;Living with Fran&quot; created by David Garrett. Following &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, in which he both wrote and starred, Kennedy co-wrote the MTV show &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up&quot; (2006) featuring his friend, Stu Stone.

Kennedy lent his voice to the videogame &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot; as a celebrity adversary with his own football team, the Upper Darby Cheesesteaks. He is also unlockable as a free agent tight end in season mode. His stint as Activision&#x27;s emcee at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2007, however, drew much criticism not only for his ignorance of the industry, but also for appearing to perform drunk as he insulted the audience. In a video uploaded to YouTube on June 14, 2021, Kennedy claimed that Activision had scrapped his script at the last minute and he was ad-libbing his jokes while suffering from burnout.

While working on his film &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, Kennedy wrote an autobiography titled, &quot;Wannabe: A Hollywood Experiment&quot;. The book chronicles his life in Hollywood as he attempts to become a star. It gives background on his life and family and quickly dives into his adventures. It tells of such things as Kennedy&#x27;s living conditions in the Hollywood slums, his dilapidated car, and his kidney issues.

A performer of stand-up comedy, he is also known for his sketch performances on his television reality show, &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot;, which became the WB Network&#x27;s highest-ranking new show in 2002, but which was cancelled in April 2004 due to falling viewership. In 2006, Jizzy Entertainment released &quot;.&quot; In 2008, Kennedy released the documentary &quot;Heckler,&quot; about the plight of stand-up comics versus their often-aggressive audiences. In 2007 and 2017, he made two appearances in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; as a cannibal satanist serial killer.

From 2008 to 2010, Kennedy played psychology professor Eli James in the CBS drama &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;. From 2009 to 2013, he was in the TV series, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, playing Roberta Tubbs&#x27; boyfriend.

He also stars in Nicktoons&#x27; &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot; as Kyle, an insecure boy wizard who loathes the fun-loving Fanboy and Chum Chum, but who secretly yearns for their friendship. In April 2010, sources reported that Kennedy would very likely return to the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise to star in the fourth installment; however, according to &quot;Scream&quot; screenwriter Kevin Williamson, plans were never made for him to rejoin the franchise, attributing the misinformation to a fabrication by Kennedy.
On December 31, 2012, Kennedy hosted and produced &quot;First Night 2013 with Jamie Kennedy&quot;, a New Year&#x27;s Eve television special widely considered one of the worst shows of all time. His film &quot;Lost &amp; Found in Armenia&quot;, in which he plays an American tourist who ends up in an Armenian village, accused of being a Turkish spy, later opened to select theatres on June 7, 2013. His film &quot;Buddy Hutchins&quot;, in which Kennedy plays a down-on-his-luck recovering alcoholic, was released in 2015. In 2015, he portrayed Frump in the Colton Tran adventure mystery film &quot;Gloom&quot; and Beach Patrolman Alex in Allegra Pictures&#x27; horror film &quot;The Sand&quot;. In 2015, he also starred as Travis Welker in &quot;Tremors 5: Bloodlines&quot; and as Rob in &quot;Rivers 9&quot;.

Kennedy played NARAL Pro-Choice America founder Larry Lader in the 2020 film &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which stars a predominantly conservative ensemble cast. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, which noted the film depicts Lader as &quot;a shady figure pulling strings from behind the scenes who treats abortions as a money-making operation,&quot; Kennedy said he personally supports abortion rights and appeared in the film to perform in a dramatic role that he is not normally offered, and that, &quot;it’s also not fair for people to think that because I’m in a project with them that I’m like that, or that I believe in this stuff.&quot;

==Personal life==

Kennedy dated his &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt from March 2009 to March 2010. 

Kennedy was active in California&#x27;s tourism campaign, having appeared in several commercials with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

<text>Roland Bernard &quot;Bunny&quot; Berigan (November 2, 1908 – June 2, 1942) was an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader who rose to fame during the swing era. His career and influence were shortened by alcoholism, and ended with his early demise at the age of 33 from cirrhosis. Although he composed some jazz instrumentals such as &quot;Chicken and Waffles&quot; and &quot;Blues&quot;, Berigan was best known for his virtuoso jazz trumpeting. His 1937 classic recording &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1975.

==Early life and career==
Berigan was born in Hilbert, Wisconsin, the son of William Patrick Berigan and Mary Catherine (Mayme) Schlitzberg, and raised in Fox Lake. Having learned the violin and trumpet, Berigan started his career playing with local bands as a teenager, including the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s jazz ensemble (although he never actually went to college). After first trying out for the Hal Kemp Orchestra and being rejected he joined the band in late 1929. His first recorded trumpet solos were with the orchestra, which toured England and a few other European countries in 1930. He also appeared as featured soloist with bands fronted by Rudy Vallee, Tommy Dorsey, Abe Lyman, Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman.

Shortly after the Kemp orchestra returned to the U.S. in late 1930, Berigan, like fellow trumpeter Mannie Klein, the Dorsey Brothers and Artie Shaw, became a sought-after studio musician in New York. Fred Rich, Freddy Martin and Ben Selvin sought his services for record dates. He joined the staff of CBS radio network musicians in early 1931. Berigan recorded his first vocal, &quot;At Your Command&quot;, with Rich that year. From late 1932 through early 1934, Berigan was a member of Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra, before playing with Abe Lyman&#x27;s band briefly in 1934.

He returned to freelancing in the New York recording studios and working on staff at CBS radio in 1934. He recorded as a sideman on hundreds of commercial records, most notably with the Dorsey Brothers and on Glenn Miller&#x27;s earliest recording as a leader in 1935, playing on &quot;Solo Hop&quot;. At the same time, Berigan joined Benny Goodman&#x27;s Swing Band. Jazz talent scout and producer John H. Hammond, who also became Goodman&#x27;s brother-in-law, later wrote that he helped persuade Gene Krupa to re-join Goodman, with whom he had had an earlier falling-out, by mentioning that Berigan, whom Krupa admired, was already committed to the new ensemble. With Berigan and Krupa both on board, the Goodman band made the tour that ended at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, the performance often credited with the launch of the swing era. Berigan recorded a number of solos while with Goodman, including &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;m Happy&quot;, and &quot;Blue Skies&quot;.

===Fame===
Berigan left Goodman to return again to freelancing as a recording and radio musician in Manhattan. During this time (late 1935 and throughout 1936), he began to record regularly under his own name, and he continued to back singers such as Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey, and Billie Holiday. He spent some time with Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s orchestra in late 1936 and early 1937, working as a jazz soloist on Dorsey&#x27;s radio program and on several records. His solo on the Dorsey hit recording &quot;Marie&quot; became one of his signature performances. In 1937, Berigan assembled a band to record and tour under his name, picking the then-little known Ira Gershwin–Vernon Duke composition &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; as his theme song. He made three attempts to organize a band of his own, his last try meeting success, playing trumpet in nearly every number while directing the band. Berigan&#x27;s trumpet work and vocal made his recorded performance of it for Victor the biggest hit of his career. Berigan modeled his trumpet style in part on Louis Armstrong&#x27;s, and he often acknowledged Armstrong as his idol. Still, his trumpet sound and jazz ideas were unique, earning Armstrong&#x27;s praise both before and after Berigan&#x27;s death.

==Bandleader==
Berigan led his own band full-time from early 1937 until June 1942, with a six-month hiatus in 1940 as a sideman in Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s band. A series of misfortunes and Berigan&#x27;s alcoholism worked against his financial success as a bandleader. Berigan also began an affair with singer Lee Wiley in 1936, which lasted into 1940. The stresses of bandleading drove Berigan to drink even more heavily. Among the players who worked in the Berigan band were: drummers Buddy Rich, Dave Tough, George Wettling, Johnny Blowers and Jack Sperling; alto saxophonists and clarinetists Gus Bivona, Joe Dixon and Andy Fitzgerald; vocalists Danny Richards, Ruth Bradley and Kathleen Lane; pianist Joe Bushkin; trombonist and arranger Ray Conniff; trombonist Sonny Lee; bassists Hank Wayland and Morty Stulmaker; trumpeters Carl Warwick, Steve Lipkins and Les Elgart; tenor saxophonists Georgie Auld and Don Lodice; and pianist and arranger Joe Lipman.

Berigan was regularly featured on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Swing Club&quot; broadcasts from 1936 into 1937. This network radio show helped further popularize jazz as the swing era reached its peak. For the balance of the 1930s, he sometimes appeared on this program as a guest.

In the late 1930s, Berigan&#x27;s drinking and consequent health problems may have contributed to his band&#x27;s chronic financial and booking difficulties.

==Final years and death==
Berigan&#x27;s business troubles drove him to declare bankruptcy in 1939, and shortly after to join Tommy Dorsey as a featured jazz soloist. By September 1940, Berigan briefly led a new small group, but soon reorganized a touring big band. Berigan led moderately successful big bands from the fall of 1940 into early 1942, and was on the comeback trail when his health declined alarmingly. On April 20, 1942, while on tour, Berigan was hospitalized with pneumonia in Allegheny General Hospital Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, until May 8. His doctors discovered that cirrhosis had severely damaged his liver. He was advised to stop drinking and stop playing the trumpet for an undetermined length of time. Berigan did not do either. He returned to his band on tour and played for a few weeks before he returned to his home at the Van Cortlandt Hotel on 49th Street, in New York City, where he suffered a massive hemorrhage on May 31, 1942. He died two days later in Stuyvesant Polyclinic Hospital, New York, at age 33. 

Funeral services were conducted June 3 at Saint Malachy&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in New York. He was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery south of Fox Lake, Wisconsin.

==Legacy==
In compliance with Berigan&#x27;s wish, the band was kept intact under his name. Donna Berigan, his widow, maintained his financial interest in it. Tenor sax player Vido Musso became the leader.

In 1938, Victor Records released a compilation of Berigan&#x27;s recordings as bandleader.

His 1937 recording of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; was used in the film &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; (1973), the Roman Polanski film &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), and a Martin Scorsese short film, &quot;The Big Shave&quot; (1967). Woody Allen has used Berigan&#x27;s music occasionally in his films. In 2010, his Victor recording of &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot; was used on a Gap Inc. clothing TV commercial. Berigan&#x27;s name has been used frequently in the comic strip &quot;Crankshaft&quot;.

Starting in 1974, Fox Lake, Wisconsin held an annual Bunny Berigan Jazz Jubilee originally organized by Berigan&#x27;s daughter, Joyce Hansen, until she was incapacitated by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and then by Julie Fleming. The final Jubilee was held in 2018. Most of Berigan&#x27;s recordings are available, and two full-length biographies of him have been published.

==Top compositions==
Berigan&#x27;s top compositions include &quot;Chicken and waffles&quot;, released as Decca 18117 in 1935 as by Bunny&#x27;s Blue Boys, and &quot;Blues&quot;, released in 1935 as Decca 18116, also with the Blue Boys. (This 1935 session was produced by John H. Hammond at Decca for issue in the UK on Parlophone. The Decca releases were part of a four-pocket album set issued in the 1940s during the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike.)

==Honors==
In 1975, Berigan&#x27;s 1937 recording &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; on Victor (25728-A) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Berigan was inducted in the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame in 2008.

==Personal life==
Bunny&#x27;s youngest daughter, Joyce &quot;Jo,&quot; was born on April 22, 1936, and died on July 4, 2011. Her older sister, Patricia, was born in New York City on July 23, 1932, and died on December 8, 1998.

When Arakawa was 5 years old, she became interested in skating and entered the Chibikko Skate School. She started ballet lessons at 7. While still 7, Arakawa began training with former Olympian Hiroshi Nagakubo, a pair skater who competed in the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. She was landing triple Salchows at age 8.

In 1994, she began participating in Japanese national skating competitions. She was named the 1994, 1995, 1996 &quot;All Japan Junior Figure&quot; athlete. Arakawa progressed through the Japanese ranks quickly and was the first skater in Japan to win three consecutive junior national titles.

===Senior career===

Arakawa was the senior national Japanese champion in both 1998 and 1999. She made her Olympic debut when she represented Japan in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano at age 16. The Emperor and Empress of Japan attended the ladies&#x27; free skate event. She placed 13th at the Nagano Olympics. At that time, she was ranked number 2 in Japan. In 2002, Arakawa finished second at Japan&#x27;s national championships and, as a result, was not named to the Japanese 2002 Winter Olympics team.

During the 2002–2003 skating season, Arakawa won the Asian Winter Games and the Winter Universiade. She earned her second consecutive silver medal at the Four Continents Championships. She took the bronze at the NHK Trophy, and placed fifth at the Cup of Russia. She qualified for the ISU Grand Prix Final, where she finished fourth. She later placed third at the Japanese Nationals, marking her fifth medal from this meet, with two golds and two silvers from previous seasons.

In 2004, she won the World Championships in Dortmund, Germany, defeating Americans Sasha Cohen and Michelle Kwan, after landing seven clean triple jumps. She was the third Japanese woman to win this title after Midori Ito who won in 1989 and Yuka Sato in 1994. Arakawa had planned to retire after the 2004 World Championships, but her victory there convinced her to change her plans.

In 2005, Arakawa won the NHK Trophy and came in second place at the Grand Prix Finals. At the 2005 World Championships, Arakawa finished 9th, a disappointment which she later credited as a motivation to stay in the sport and regain top form. She felt she could not quit on such a down note. In November 2005, Arakawa changed coaches to Nikolai Morozov.

===2006 Winter Olympics===

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Arakawa skated in the short program to Fantaisie-Impromptu by Chopin. She went into the long program in third place, behind pre-event favorites Sasha Cohen and Irina Slutskaya. Less than a point separated the top three skaters. In the long program, Cohen was the first of the three leaders to skate, followed by Arakawa and Slutskaya. Cohen made two major mistakes during her long program, leaving the door open to the other leaders.

Arakawa won the free program, skating to Vanessa Mae&#x27;s Violin Fantasy on Puccini&#x27;s Turandot by Giacomo Puccini. She performed an Ina Bauer and then did a three jump combination. &quot;Ina Bauer&quot; became a household word in Japan as a result. Although she had planned two triple-triple combinations for the free skate, she did not perform them, doing instead a triple Lutz-double loop and a triple Salchow-double toe loop combinations. Arakawa earned a total combined score of 191.34 points, almost eight points ahead of the second-place Cohen (183.36). Like Cohen, Slutskaya made mistakes in her long program, and ended up taking bronze, leaving Arakawa as the gold medal winner, which was also Japan&#x27;s only medal of the 2006 games. Slutskaya was third at 181.44. At age 24, Arakawa became the oldest women&#x27;s Olympic skating champion in more than 80 years. Florence &quot;Madge&quot; Cave Syers from the United Kingdom was the oldest when she won the Olympic title at age 27 at the 1908 Summer Olympics, which featured the first Olympic figure skating events.

After winning her Olympic title, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called Arakawa in Turin, Italy to congratulate her. Koizumi said, &quot;I cheered for you with excitement while I watched television. All the Japanese people are rejoicing. I give a perfect score to every bit of your performance.&quot;

===Post-competitive career===
Arakawa retired after her Olympic victory. She continued to skate in ice shows and is a regular skating commentator on Japanese television. She competed at the 2006 Ice Wars on the World team. She also produces her own show, Friends on Ice, and is a recurring cast member at Fantasy on Ice, where she performed with Mai Kuraki to the charity song &quot;Anata ga Irukara&quot; in 2011 amongst others. Arakawa also does choreography.

In 2006, Arakawa appeared in a Japanese TV drama, &quot;Shichinin no onna bengoshi&quot; (7 female lawyers), presented by Asahi TV. She played the role of a cool public prosecutor, Yayoi Shimasaki, in the 8th episode.

She competed in an ABC skating series &quot;Thin Ice,&quot; aired on March 19, 2010, paired with 2006 Olympic men&#x27;s silver medallist Stéphane Lambiel. They came first in the viewer&#x27;s votes, and ended the series in third place, winning a total of $45,000. They skated to the songs &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; by Beyoncé and &quot;Magic&quot; by Robin Thicke.

As a professional figure skater, she has appeared in all three previous editions of the cross-genre ice show &quot;Hyoen&quot; (2017, 2019, 2024) starring Olympic bronze medalist Daisuke Takahashi, as well as in &quot;Hyoen&quot;&#x27;s spin-off &quot;Luxe&quot; (2021).

On April 18, 2018, Arakawa was elected to the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

In October 2024 she joined forces with Daisuke Takahashi, Kana Muramoto, Takahito Mura, Kazuki Tomono, Keiji Tanaka, Yuna Aoki, Kosho Oshima, Yuto Kishina and Rena Uezono to launch the members-only official fan community &quot;F-Ske&quot; on the platform &quot;FANICON&quot;.

==Signature moves==
Arakawa is known for her jumping ability, particularly her difficult triple-triple combinations, like the triple Salchow-triple toe and the triple Lutz-triple toe, sometimes combined with a double loop. She has executed triple-triple-triple combination jumps in practice, the most of which have been the triple Salchow-triple toe-triple loop combination. She has also executed the triple Lutz-triple loop combination in practice. According to figure skating historian James R. Hines, Arakawa was &quot;remembered for her artistry&quot;.

Arakawa is known for the quietness of her blades. She is also a strong spinner. She has an excellent donut spin, a difficult variation of the Camel spin, that requires great flexibility. In 2004, she added a Biellmann spin to her repertoire. Arakawa&#x27;s signature spiral is a Y-spiral where she releases her free leg and completes the spiral with her leg still close to her head, without the hand assist.

Her trademark move is the Ina Bauer with a full backbend. Due to Arakawa&#x27;s use of this move during her free skate at the 2006 Olympics, the term &quot;Ina Bauer&quot; became very popular in Japan, and Arakawa&#x27;s performance of it became iconic. The Ina Bauer move is often referred to in Japan by Arakawa&#x27;s name.

<doc id="559202" wikidata="Q272161" url="?curid=559202" title="Lady Byron">
<text>Anne Isabella Noel Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth and Baroness Byron (; 17 May 1792 – 16 May 1860), nicknamed Annabella and commonly known as Lady Byron, was an educational reformer and philanthropist who established the first industrial school in England, and was an active abolitionist. She married the poet George Gordon Byron, more commonly known as Lord Byron, and separated from him after less than a year, keeping their daughter Ada Lovelace in her custody despite laws at the time giving fathers sole custody of children.

Lady Byron&#x27;s reminiscences, published after her death by Harriet Beecher Stowe, revealed her fears about alleged incest between Lord Byron and his half-sister. The scandal about Lady Byron&#x27;s suspicions accelerated Byron&#x27;s intentions to leave England and return to the Mediterranean where he had lived in 1810.

Their daughter, Ada, worked as a mathematician with Charles Babbage, the pioneer of computer science, and is known as the first programmer.

==Names and family==
Lady Byron was born Anne Isabella Milbanke, the only child of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 6th Baronet, and his wife, the Hon. Judith Noel (1751-1822), sister of Thomas Noel, Viscount Wentworth.

Her father&#x27;s only surviving sibling was Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne, the influential political hostess. Her children, Anne&#x27;s cousins, were: 
* Hon. Peniston Lamb (1770–1805)
* William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne (1779–1848)
* Frederick Lamb, 3rd Viscount Melbourne (1782–1853)
* Hon. George Lamb (1784–1834)
* Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper (1787–1869)
* Harriet Lamb (1789–1803)

Her mother&#x27;s only surviving sibling had no legitimate heirs, but he did have one son before his marriage, named after him, Thomas Noel; he became a clergyman.

When Anne&#x27;s maternal uncle died, a few months after her marriage to Lord Byron, Lady Milbanke and her cousin Lord Scarsdale jointly inherited his estate. The family subsequently took the surname Noel over Milbanke.

Lord Wentworth had been both a viscount and a baron. Upon his death the viscountcy became extinct, and the barony fell into abeyance between Lady Milbanke and Lord Scarsdale. After their deaths the barony passed to Lady Byron and she became Baroness Wentworth in her own right; however she did not use the title. She signed her letters &quot;A. I. Noel Byron&quot; and her will as &quot;Baroness Noel-Byron&quot;. The world knew her as &quot;Lady Byron&quot;, and her friends and family called her by her nickname, &quot;Annabella&quot;.

==Youth==
She was a gifted child. To cultivate her obvious intelligence, her parents hired as her tutor a former Cambridge University professor by the name of William Frend. Under his direction, her education proceeded much like that of a Cambridge student; her studies involved classical literature, philosophy, science and mathematics, in which she particularly delighted. This fascination led her husband to nickname her his &quot;princess of parallelograms&quot;.

Annabella developed into a stiff, religious woman with strict morals. She was aware of her strong intellect and was not ashamed to demonstrate it in her social realm. Often described as cold and prim, she seemed an unlikely match for the man who would become her ultimate obsession, the dramatically dark and &quot;morally fractured&quot; poet Lord Byron. Their first meeting occurred in March 1812. She later said to her mother that though she would not venture to introduce herself to Lord Byron, she would certainly accept his introduction if it were offered.

Byron&#x27;s popularity was soaring following the success of his work &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;. Annabella met him on many social occasions as he began a relationship with Lady Caroline Lamb, the wife of her cousin, William Lamb. However, Byron was attracted to her modesty and intellect and in October 1812 he proposed marriage through her aunt, the well-connected political hostess Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne. In response, she wrote a summary of his character and three days later refused him. However, they were plagued with a persistent interest in each other.

Although well aware of Byron&#x27;s shortcomings, telling her mother &quot;He is a very bad, very good man&quot;, she decided it was her religious obligation to support him and improve his behaviour. In August 1813, she contacted him in writing for the first time. The letters continued into the next year, some offering reassurance and support during times when public opinion of him was not favorable, others describing the &quot;imperfect attachment&quot; she felt for him. During this time, he accepted an invitation from Sir Ralph Milbanke to visit Seaham Hall, the family home in County Durham.

==Marriage==
When George Gordon Byron proposed a second time, in September 1814, she did accept. The couple were married privately, and by special licence, at Seaham Hall in County Durham on 2 January 1815. The officiating clergyman was her cousin, the Rev. Thomas Noel of Kirkby Mallory, illegitimate son of her uncle, Viscount Wentworth. The couple lived at Piccadilly Terrace in London.

Byron was then in extreme financial distress. He rejected payments offered for his written works, as he believed business was not appropriate for a gentleman, and gave copyrights to people who had helped him. He was having difficulty selling his estates at Newstead Abbey and Rochdale to clear his debt. During the summer of 1815 he began to unleash his anger and hostility on his wife. His moods were dark and he began to drink heavily. In a letter to his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, he stated his suspicions that his wife had broken the lock on his desk and searched it. Later that year he began an affair with Susan Boyce, a London actress at Drury Lane Theatre, where he was a director.

Annabella became increasingly upset. In the late stages of pregnancy, she feared her husband might be going mad. In November 1815 she wrote to Augusta and told her of Byron&#x27;s moods and behaviour. In answer to her sister-in-law&#x27;s letter, Augusta travelled to the Byrons&#x27; home to assist. Upon her arrival she became the subject of Byron&#x27;s wrath and believed him to be temporarily insane. On 10 December Annabella gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, a daughter whom they named Ada. Byron&#x27;s despair seemed to increase.

==Separation==
In January 1816, as the Byrons passed their first anniversary, Byron decided they must move from the rented house at Piccadilly Terrace. He recommended that Annabella take their daughter to her parents&#x27; home and stay there temporarily until he settled their finances. In disbelief, Anne sought medical advice, as she had become convinced her husband had gone mad. She invited a physician to their home to assess him; Byron was unaware of the true purpose for the visit. The doctor recommended she do as Byron requested and move to her parents&#x27; estate.

Annabella began a detailed documentation of her husband&#x27;s behaviour, moods and speech. She contacted his solicitor and friend, John Hanson, and told him her concern that her husband would take his life. She also provided Hanson with a pamphlet on hydrocephalus, accompanied by notes that suggested Byron could have this particular condition. Following this conversation, she took Ada and travelled to her parents&#x27; residence at Kirkby Mallory in Leicestershire. She would not see her husband again.

==Educational reformist and abolitionist==

Lady Byron committed herself to social causes, such as prison reform and the abolition of slavery. In furtherance of the latter, Lady Byron attended the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention, where she was one of the few women included in its commemorative painting.

Lady Byron lived in Ealing between around 1822 and 1840, and established Ealing Grove School.

==Daughter==

As her daughter grew up, Lady Byron feared she might inherit her father&#x27;s behaviours and dark moods. She schooled Ada in science and mathematics and discouraged literary study. Though her effort was great, it eventually seemed in vain: Ada Lovelace embodied many of her father&#x27;s rebellious qualities. She is also considered to have been the world&#x27;s first computer programmer, having written the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine—Charles Babbage&#x27;s analytical engine.

Ada married William, Lord King (who took the surname King-Noel) when she was 19. William was subsequently made the 1st Earl Lovelace, and the couple had three children, Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham and 12th Baron Wentworth; Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth, who brought the Arabian horse to England; and Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace. Ada amassed considerable gambling debts before dying from uterine cancer on 27 November 1852. Lady Byron attended her daughter&#x27;s deathbed and, under her influence, Ada underwent a religious conversion. Ada was 36 years old when she died, the same age as Byron when he died.

==Later life==

During her first month away from him, Annabella wrote to Byron affectionately, addressing him as &quot;dearest Duck&quot;. Meanwhile, she and her parents sought legal counsel. Their attorney recommended a legal separation and sent Byron a letter proposing the separation. Augusta Leigh, who had remained with Byron at Piccadilly Terrace since his wife&#x27;s departure, intercepted the letter, as she feared he would commit suicide if he knew of it. She returned the letter to Kirkby Mallory and communicated her opinion that greater consideration should be taken in the matter of the Byrons&#x27; marriage. A week later, however, a messenger sent Lord Byron the proposal again.

This time it reached him, but he refused to believe that she no longer wanted to be married to him. He asked Mrs Leigh to write to her; in addition, he refused to dissolve their marriage. A short while later, when Lady Byron made clear her suspicions that his relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh was incestuous, that he had had homosexual relationships, and had sodomised her – Lady Byron – acts which were illegal, he changed his mind. He agreed to grant her request if she proved that the request for legal separation was truly hers and not that of her parents. In response, she personally communicated her feelings to Augusta. Byron kept his word, and their separation was made legal in March 1816, in a private settlement.

Following the settlement, Augusta wrote to Annabella; the latter&#x27;s solicitor replied to the private note. Byron was enraged by such cold treatment of his half-sister. Soon after the dissolution of his marriage, he left England and lived the remainder of his days abroad. Though she wished to separate from her husband, Annabella was obsessed by him until her death. She was motivated to save his soul and secure him a place in Heaven. In the years following their separation, she came to believe that the time she had spent with him guaranteed he would experience God&#x27;s embrace upon his death. She kept his letters, copies of her own to him, and letters about him. She carefully documented their relationship, supposedly in preparation for any challenge Lord Byron might make for custody of their daughter.

Byron never sought custody of Ada, though he sent for both of them shortly before his death in Greece on 19 April 1824. Lady Byron&#x27;s obsession with him did not end with his death. Ultimately her relationship with him defined her life.

==Death==

Lady Byron died of breast cancer on 16 May 1860, the day before her 68th birthday. She was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery at Kensal Green in London. Prior to her death, she shared the story of her marriage to Byron with Harriet Beecher Stowe, who encouraged her to remain silent. In 1869 Stowe published the account given to her, the first time anyone had publicly hinted at an incestuous relationship between Byron and his half-sister. Stowe was criticized for writing a supposedly &quot;indecent&quot; article and lost popularity. Initially biographers criticized Lady Byron as &quot;small-minded;&quot; more recent works have provided a fuller picture of her accomplishments.

Lady Byron&#x27;s barony passed to her grandson Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham.

In her will she left a £300 legacy to the writer George MacDonald, whom she had patronized during her life.

Lady Byron Lane, off Knowle Road, Solihull, is named after her. Lady Byron was heiress of the Knowle estates through her father, Sir Ralph Milbanke Noel.

<doc id="559203" wikidata="Q8564177" url="?curid=559203" title="Foggy Bottom–GWU station">
<text>Foggy Bottom–GWU station is a Washington Metro station in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States. The island-platformed station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines, the station is located on I Street on the George Washington University (GWU) campus. It is the last westbound station in the District of Columbia on these lines before they dive under the Potomac River to Virginia.

== History ==
The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian and Stadium–Armory stations. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line&#x27;s opening on November 20, 1978.

== Station layout ==
Foggy Bottom–GWU uses a simple island platform layout: one platform with a track on each side. Track C1 carries eastbound trains to and whilst track C2 is used by westbound trains to , , and . As with all stations on the Metro, there are platform edge lights to warn passengers of incoming trains.

In 2008, WMATA installed red-colored LED lights at Foggy Bottom–GWU and other busy stations after a successful pilot at Gallery Place. There is a 22 coffer &quot;waffle vault&quot; ceiling at Foggy Bottom–GWU as it was one of the first stations to be built in the system; later underground stations abandoned this design for a simpler concrete arch.

There is a single mezzanine located at the center of the platform. Escalators from here allow passengers to descend to platform level or to the sole entrance and exit of the station at the northwestern corner of I and 23rd Streets. A total of two elevators and six escalators (three between the street and mezzanine and three between the mezzanine and platform) are currently in use at the station.

In 2007, WMATA released a report detailing the potential to add a second entrance to the east side of the platform, serving the intersection of 22nd and I streets. No further action has been taken to construct this entrance, through the land proposed to host the surface aspect remains unbuilt upon.

== Location ==
Foggy Bottom–GWU serves the neighborhood of Foggy Bottom and the campus of George Washington University. It is also the nearest station to the Georgetown neighborhood. The station is located at 23rd and I streets in Northwest, just south of Washington Circle, and at the front entrance to the George Washington University Hospital.

Service began on July 1, 1977. The World Bank is located one block south and eight blocks east at Pennsylvania Avenue and 18th Street and The Watergate is slightly more than .75 miles (1.2 km) southwest of the station. Slightly south of The Watergate is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

<text>First Star Software, Inc. was a Chappaqua, New York based video game development, publishing and licensing company, founded by Richard Spitalny (who remains the company&#x27;s president), Billy Blake, Peter Jablon, and Fernando Herrera in 1982. It is best known for the series &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, which began on the Atari 8-bit computers, and &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;, which first appeared on the Commodore 64. Games were ported to or written for home computers, consoles, and later for Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and portable devices. Millions of units have been sold in both the &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; and &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; series of games.

==History==
Fernando Herrera wrote an educational program for Atari 8-bit computers, &quot;My First Alphabet&quot;, which was published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1981. That same year, Atari, Inc., created an award to honor the year&#x27;s best APX submission. The first Atari Star went to &quot;My First Alphabet&quot; along with a $25,000 prize. Herrera partnered with Richard Spitalny, Billy Blake, and Peter Jablon to found First Star Software. His story of winning the Atari Star made him the face of the company.

First Star&#x27;s inaugural release was the Atari 8-bit computer shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Astro Chase&quot;, which was later distributed by Parker Brothers. Herrera also wrote &quot;Bristles&quot; and &quot;&quot; for First Star.

First Star&#x27;s two biggest titles came from outside developers, &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; and &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;, each of which was the first game in a series.

As of January 1, 2018 the First Star Software name and website are owned by BBG Entertainment GmbH which also purchased all intellectual property rights pertaining to &quot;Astro Chase&quot;, &quot;BOiNG!&quot;, &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, &quot;Bristles&quot;, &quot;Flip &amp; Flop&quot;, &quot;Millennium Warriors&quot;, &quot;Omnicron Conspiracy&quot;, &quot;Panic Button&quot;, &quot;Rent Wars&quot; and &quot;Security Alert&quot;.

<text>The Entrez () Global Query Cross-Database Search System is a federated search engine, or web portal that allows users to search many discrete health sciences databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. The NCBI is a part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which is itself a department of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which in turn is a part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The name &quot;Entrez&quot; (a greeting meaning &quot;Come in&quot; in French) was chosen to reflect the spirit of welcoming the public to search the content available from the NLM.

Entrez Global Query is an integrated search and retrieval system that provides access to all databases simultaneously with a single query string and user interface. Entrez can efficiently retrieve related sequences, structures, and references. The Entrez system can provide views of gene and protein sequences and chromosome maps. Some textbooks are also available online through the Entrez system.

== Features ==

The Entrez front page provides, by default, access to the global query. All databases indexed by Entrez can be searched via a single query string, supporting Boolean operators and search term tags to limit parts of the search statement to particular fields. This returns a unified results page, that shows the number of hits for the search in each of the databases, which are also linked to actual search results for that particular database.

Entrez also provides a similar interface for searching each particular database and for refining search results. The Limits feature allows the user to narrow a search, a web forms interface. The History feature gives a numbered list of recently performed queries. Results of previous queries can be referred to by number and combined via Boolean operators. Search results can be saved temporarily in a Clipboard. Users with a MyNCBI account can save queries indefinitely, and also choose to have updates with new search results e-mailed for saved queries of most databases. It is widely used in the field of biotechnology as a reference tool for students and professionals alike.

== Databases ==
Entrez searches the following databases:

*PubMed: biomedical literature citations and abstracts, including Medline—articles from (mainly medical) journals, often including abstracts. Links to PubMed Central and other full-text resources are provided for articles from the 1990s.
*PubMed Central: free, full-text journal articles
*Site Search: NCBI web and FTP web sites
*Books: online books
*Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
*&quot;Nucleotide&quot;: sequence database (GenBank)
*&quot;Protein&quot;: sequence database (GenPept)
*&quot;Genome&quot;: whole genome sequences and mapping
*&quot;Structure&quot;: three-dimensional macromolecular structures
*&quot;Taxonomy&quot;: organisms in GenBank Taxonomy
*&quot;dbSNP&quot;: single nucleotide polymorphism
*&quot;Gene&quot;: gene-centered information
*&quot;HomoloGene&quot;: eukaryotic homology groups
*PubChem Compound: unique small molecule chemical structures
*PubChem Substance: deposited chemical substance records
*Genome Project: genome project information
*UniGene: gene-oriented clusters of transcript sequences
*&quot;CDD&quot;: conserved protein domain database
*&quot;PopSet&quot;: population study data sets (epidemiology)
*&quot;GEO Profiles&quot;: expression and molecular abundance profiles
*&quot;GEO DataSets&quot;: experimental sets of GEO data
*&quot;Sequence read archive&quot;: high-throughput sequencing data
*&quot;Cancer Chromosomes&quot;: cytogenetic databases
*&quot;PubChem BioAssay&quot;: bioactivity screens of chemical substances
*&quot;Probe&quot;: sequence-specific reagents
*&quot;NLM Catalog&quot;: NLM bibliographic data for over 1.2 million journals, books, audiovisuals, computer software, electronic resources, and other materials resident in LocatorPlus (updated every weekday).

== Access ==

In addition to using the search engine forms to query the data in Entrez, NCBI provides the Entrez Programming Utilities (eUtils) for more direct access to query results. The eUtils are accessed by posting specially formed URLs to the NCBI server, and parsing the XML response. There was also an eUtils SOAP interface which was terminated in July 2015.

==History==

In 1991, Entrez was introduced in CD form. In 1993, a client-server version of the software provided connectivity with the internet. In 1994, NCBI established a website, and Entrez was a part of this initial release. In 2001, Entrez bookshelf was released and in 2003, the Entrez Gene database was developed.

<text>The Transall C-160 is a military transport aircraft, produced as a joint venture between France and Germany. &quot;Transall&quot; is a German abbreviation of the manufacturing consortium &quot;Transporter Allianz&quot;, comprising the companies of MBB, Aerospatiale, and VFW-Fokker.

The C-160 was developed during the late 1950s and 1960s with the initial goal of fulfilling the requirements for a modern transport aircraft for both the French and German Air Forces. On 25 February 1963, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; the type entered service four years later. Production was divided between the German and French consortium members; early on, multiple production lines were operated, but this was reorganised to use a single assembly line in Toulouse during the late 1970s. In addition to the type&#x27;s domestic sales, the C-160 achieved some success on the export market; such customers included the South African Air Force and Turkish Air Force as well as a number of civilian operators.

The C-160 has had a lengthy service life, during which it has provided logistical support during numerous overseas operations, including the invasion of Cyprus, the South African Border War, and the Gulf War. Furthermore, it has adapted to fulfil several specialist roles, such as an aerial refueling tanker, electronic intelligence gathering, and as a communications platform. In French and German service, the C-160 has been replaced by the larger and newer Airbus A400M Atlas, and a small number of Lockheed-Martin C-130J Super Hercules during the early twenty-first century. Nevertheless, The C-160 remains in active service more than 60 years after the type&#x27;s first flight in 1963.

===Origins===
In the late 1950s, a requirement arose to replace the piston-engined Nord Noratlas transports operated by the air forces of both France (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;) and Germany (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;). Keen to encourage industrial co-operation between the two countries, as had happened under a previous arrangement in which Noratlases for German service had been built under license by Weser Flugzeugbau, France and Germany signed an agreement for the development of a Noratlas successor on 28 November 1957. The Italian government also became involved in the project early on to meet their own requirements, however Italy&#x27;s participation in the fledgling program was soon terminated in favour of the smaller and locally-built Fiat G.222.

The consortium, &quot;Transporter-Allianz&quot; or Transall, was formed in January 1959 between the French company Nord Aviation and the German companies Weser Flugzeugbau (which became Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964) and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) to design and build the new transport. The new aircraft was required to carry a cargo over a range of or a load of over a range of and be able to operate out of semi-prepared airstrips. One prototype was built by each of the production partners, with the first (built by Nord) flying on 25 February 1963, with the VFW and HFB-built prototypes following on 25 May 1963 and 19 February 1964. These were followed by six pre-production examples, stretched by compared with the prototypes, which flew between 1965 and 1966.

===Production===
Production orders were delayed by attempts by Lockheed to sell its C-130 Hercules transport to Germany; these attempts were rebuffed, and a contract was signed for 160 C-160s (110 for Germany and 50 for France) on 24 September 1964. Manufacturing work was split between Germany and France in line with the number of orders placed; Nord built the wings and engine nacelles, VFW the centre fuselage and horizontal tail, and HFB the forward and rear fuselage. The aircraft&#x27;s tail fin was to be built by Dornier. Three production lines were set up to assemble these components at each of the three main partners.

The first production airframes were delivered to France and Germany from 1967. The first batch included 110 &quot;C-160D&quot;s for the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;), 50 &quot;C-160F&quot;s for the French Air Force, and nine &quot;C-160Z&quot;s for the South African Air Force. Four C-160Fs were converted to &quot;C-160P&quot; air mail transport aircraft, and were operated by Air France. Production continued until October 1972. Britain expressed interest in both procuring and manufacturing C-160s; while talks took place between Transall, the British Aircraft Corporation, and the British Government, the C-130 was opted for instead.

In July 1977, France placed an order for 25 aircraft to be built to an improved standard. Production work for the new variant was split 50-50 between Aérospatiale (the successor to Nord) and MBB (which had absorbed VFW and HFB), with a single assembly line in Toulouse. The cargo loading door on the port side of the fuselage was replaced by provision for additional fuel tanks in the wing centre section. When fitted these tanks increased fuel capacity from to . The aircraft were also fitted with updated avionics. The first second generation C-160 took flight in 1981. Aircraft produced in this batch included 29 for France (an additional four non-standard aircraft were constructed for special missions), and 6 for Indonesia.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Transall C-160 is a twin-engine tactical transport featuring a cargo hold, a rear-access ramp beneath an upswept tail, a high-mounted wing and turboprop engines. The C-160 is designed to perform cargo and troop transport duties, aerial delivery of supplies and equipment and is designed to be compatible with international railway loading gauges to simplify cargo logistics and loading. In flight the cargo area is pressurised and kept at a constant temperature by integrated air conditioning systems.

Additionally, the landing gear can be partially retracted while on the ground. This lowers the C-160, making it easier to move vehicles into the hold as they don&#x27;t need to climb a ramp.

One aspect of the C-160 that made the type well suited to tactical operations is its short airfield performance, including the ability to perform steep descents of up to 20 degrees and perform landings on airstrips as short as 400 meters. In the airlift role, a later production C-160 could carry up to 8.5 tons across a distance of 5,000 kilometers, and take off from airstrips as short as 700 meters. Dependent upon aircraft configuration, a single aircraft could airdrop as many as 88 paratroopers or transport up to 93 equipped troops.

The C-160 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines, which drive a pair of four-bladed Dowty Rotol propellers. Advantages of the twin-engine configuration over four include reduced unit and production cost, lower weight and fuel consumption, simplified design and reliability. Each engine is equipped with an auxiliary generator system, providing the aircraft with both electricity and hydraulic pressure. An auxiliary power unit (General Electric CJ610) is used to power the aircraft while on the ground, and for rare use in mid-air emergencies.

===Upgrades and improvements===
An updated second generation of the C-160 was produced during the 1980s. Amongst changes made, the new variant was equipped with additional fuel tankage, aerial refuelling probes and enhanced avionics. While there were considerable changes to instrumentation, including the navigational and autopilot systems, the second generation C-160 retained the original operating characteristics to simplify crew transfers between types. The second generation C-160s were also designed for potential adaptation to other roles such as maritime patrol and aerial fire fighting.
The C-160 proved to be a versatile aircraft, leading to a long operational service life. Between its introduction and 1999, approximately 2000 modifications and upgrades were incorporated upon the type, split 60/40 between the structure and equipment respectively. Many changes were made over time in regards to the aircraft&#x27;s avionics, incorporating new features such as GPS and laser inertial navigation systems, modern autopilot and crew management systems.

Other improvements and additions to the type include kevlar armour, electronic warfare management systems, chaff/flare dispensers, missile approach warning systems and TCAS collision warning system. Extensive efforts have been made by both France and Germany to extend the aircraft&#x27;s operating lifespan up to and if necessary beyond 55 years to 2018. In 2003–2004, Germany signed separate contracts with Terma A/S and Northrop Grumman to upgrade the aircraft&#x27;s electronic warfare self-protection and missile approach warning systems.
==Operational history==
In July 1974, the Turkish Air Force used 7 C-160Ds during the invasion of Cyprus, to transport troops, drop paratroopers and carry supplies. Having entered service with the Turkish armed forces in 1971, these aircraft provided great amount of lift during the operation.

In April 1976, the French Air Force used 12 C-160s in support of Operation Verveine, airlifting Moroccan troops and equipment to Zaïre during a border conflict with Angola. In May 1978, several C-160s dropped paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion during the Battle of Kolwezi.

In 1977, the French Air Force ordered an updated version designated &quot;C-160NG&quot;, for &quot;Nouvelle Génération&quot; (&quot;New Generation&quot;). From 1981, 29 of these aircraft were delivered, half of them configured as tanker aircraft for aerial refuelling. Another four were configured as &quot;C-160H Astarté&quot; TACAMO aircraft for communication with submerged submarines, a vital component of France&#x27;s nuclear deterrent system.

In a final conversion, two aircraft were furnished for SIGINT electronic surveillance, designated &quot;C-160G Gabriel&quot;, replacing the Noratlases that had been in this role previously. In routine operations, the C-160Gs would often supplement France&#x27;s Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. In 1991, a SIGINT-equipped C-160G was deployed as part of France&#x27;s contribution to Coalition forces during and after the Gulf War to support a no-fly zone and embargoing of Iraq.
C-160s were in continuous use to support French bases in sub-Saharan Africa; the tanker variants also proved valuable in supporting African operations. The C-160 fleet was the staple of the French military airlift capability for many years, supplemented by small numbers of McDonnell Douglas DC-8s, CASA/IPTN CN-235 and Lockheed C-130 Hercules as of 1990.

During the South African Border War during the late 1980s, the South African Air Force&#x27;s C-160s were vital for deploying and supplying troops in the border region and into positions in southern Angola due to the otherwise-impassable terrain. The importance of airpower in the war led to a great deal of the fighting being centred upon remote airstrips, both sides trying to gain or deny the same advantageous positions and place stress upon the opposing force&#x27;s logistical efforts. In one particular mission, a C-160 was used to move a captured SA-8 from Angola to South Africa. The C-160 was chosen for this task over the C-130 because of its larger cargo hold and its ability to lower its hull while on the ground, which facilitated the loading of the heavy vehicle.

The C-160 has been a prominent component of several other international efforts. Germany&#x27;s C-160 fleet has been used to support peacekeeping efforts in Sudan, a regular detachment of C-160s was also dispatched in support of the multinational International Security Assistance Force presence in the Afghanistan. Both French and German C-160s were used in supporting Operation Serval, the French-led intervention in the Northern Mali conflict. For either humanitarian or military purposes, C-160s have conducted extensive operations in a number of nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, Ethiopia, Bosnia, and Lebanon.
Starting in 1984 onwards, German airframes underwent LEDA I and LEDA II life extension measures, which were focused on the wings. Subsequent programs carried out in the 1990s, such as LEDA III, concentrated on the whole structure of the aircraft; raising the airframe life from 8,000 flights to 12,000 flights, and introducing new avionics systems such as a self-defence system and a replacement flight management system.

From 1994 to 1999, all French C-160s underwent an avionics upgrade and the addition of new anti-missile countermeasures. The C-160Fs and NGs so updated were redesignated &quot;C-160R&quot; (&quot;Renové&quot;—&quot;renovated&quot;). In 2009, the French Defence Ministry announced a modernisation of the C-160 fleet, enabling it to continue in service until 2018 if required.

In late 2011, it was announced that Germany&#x27;s Transall fleet had accumulated a combined total of one million flight hours. , the global C-160 fleet was approaching the end of its service life; all South African C-160s have already been retired, while the Turkish Air Force continued to operate 20 aircraft obtained from Germany (&quot;C-160T&quot;). To replace the Transall, the German, French and South African Air Forces ordered 60, 50 and eight Airbus A400Ms, respectively; the South African order was later cancelled.

In 2015, it was announced that the retirement of Germany&#x27;s Transall fleet had been pushed back from 2018 to 2021 due to delays with the Airbus A400M; until 2021, a decreasing number of aircraft shall remain in service to perform missions that require the Transall&#x27;s self-protection suite. The last German Transall wing was disbanded in December 2021.

===Second-generation production===
From 1981 on, some new C-160 versions reached the wings of Armee de l&#x27;Air. The now C-160NG (Nouvelle Generation, New Generation) called aircraft has a fifth fuel tank in the middle of the wing above the fuselage, a refueling probe while the left side cargo door was removed. Some first-production series C-160F were fitted with the NG-versions changes and renamed C-160R (Renové).

Beside these changes, in 1989, the French Air Force introduced the &quot;C-160G Gabriel&quot; variant, a SIGINT aircraft easily to distinguish because of the antennas fitted to the aircraft.

Until the early 2000s, also the &quot;C-160H Astarte&quot; was used, while Astarté (Avion Station Relais de Transmissions Exceptionelles), meaning &quot;airborne relay station for special transmissions&quot;, was used for communication with submerged French nuclear submarines.

<text>Captopril, sold under the brand name Capoten among others, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension and some types of congestive heart failure. Captopril was the first oral ACE inhibitor found for the treatment of hypertension. It does not cause fatigue as associated with beta-blockers. Due to the adverse drug event of causing hyperkalemia, as seen with most ACE Inhibitors, the medication is usually paired with a diuretic.

Captopril was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1980.

== Structure–activity relationship ==
Captopril has an L-proline group which allows it to be more bioavailable in oral formulations. The thiol moiety within the molecule has been associated with two significant adverse effects: the hapten or immune response. This immune response, also known as agranulocytosis, can explain the adverse drug events which may be seen in captopril with the allergic response which includes hives, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat.

In terms of interaction with the enzyme, the molecule&#x27;s thiol moiety will attach to the binding site of the ACE enzyme. This will inhibit the port at which the angiotensin-1 molecule would normally bind, therefore inhibiting the downstream effects within the renin-angiotensin system.

==Medical uses==

Captopril&#x27;s main uses are based on its vasodilation and inhibition of some renal function activities. These benefits are most clearly seen in:
* Hypertension
* Cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure and after myocardial infarction
* Preservation of kidney function in diabetic nephropathy.

Additionally, it has shown mood-elevating properties in some patients. This is consistent with the observation that animal screening models indicate putative antidepressant activity for this compound, although one study has been negative. Formal clinical trials in depressed patients have not been reported.

It has also been investigated for use in the treatment of cancer. Captopril stereoisomers were also reported to inhibit some metallo-β-lactamases.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of captopril include cough due to increase in the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.
Except for postural hypotension, which occurs due to the short and fast mode of action of captopril, most of the side effects mentioned are common for all ACE inhibitors. Among these, cough is the most common adverse effect. Hyperkalemia can occur, especially if used with other drugs which elevate potassium level in blood, such as potassium-sparing diuretics. Other side effects are:

* Itching
* Headache
* Tachycardia
* Chest pain
* Palpitations
* Dysgeusia
* Weakness

The adverse drug reaction (ADR) profile of captopril is similar to other ACE inhibitors, with cough being the most common ADR. However, captopril is also commonly associated with rash and taste disturbances (metallic or loss of taste), which are attributed to the unique thiol moiety.

==Overdose==
ACE inhibitor overdose can be treated with naloxone.

==History==
In the late 1960s, John Vane of the Royal College of Surgeons of England was working on mechanisms by which the body regulates blood pressure. He was joined by Sérgio Henrique Ferreira of Brazil, who had been studying the venom of a Brazilian pit viper, the jararaca (&quot;Bothrops jararaca)&quot;, and brought a sample of the viper&#x27;s venom. Vane&#x27;s team found that one of the venom&#x27;s peptides selectively inhibited the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which was thought to function in blood pressure regulation; the snake venom functions by severely depressing blood pressure. During the 1970s, ACE was found to elevate blood pressure by controlling the release of water and salts from the kidneys.

Captopril, an analog of the snake venom&#x27;s ACE-inhibiting peptide, was first synthesized in 1975 by three researchers at the U.S. drug company E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons Pharmaceuticals (now Bristol-Myers Squibb): Miguel Ondetti, Bernard Rubin, and David Cushman. Squibb filed for U.S. patent protection on the drug in February 1976, which was granted in September 1977, and captopril was approved for medical use in 1980. It was the first ACE inhibitor developed and was considered a breakthrough both because of its mechanism of action and also because of the development process. In the 1980s, Vane received the Nobel prize and was knighted for his work and Ferreira received the National Order of Scientific Merit from Brazil.

The development of captopril was among the earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of structure-based drug design. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system had been extensively studied in the mid-20th century, and this system presented several opportune targets in the development of novel treatments for hypertension. The first two targets that were attempted were renin and ACE. Captopril was the culmination of efforts by Squibb&#x27;s laboratories to develop an ACE inhibitor.

Ondetti, Cushman, and colleagues built on work that had been done in the 1960s by a team of researchers led by John Vane at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The first breakthrough was made by Kevin K.F. Ng in 1967, when he found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II took place in the pulmonary circulation instead of in the plasma. In contrast, Sergio Ferreira found bradykinin disappeared in its passage through the pulmonary circulation. The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin were thought to be mediated by the same enzyme.

In 1970, using bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) provided by Sergio Ferreira, Ng and Vane found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. BPF was later found to be a peptide in the venom of a lancehead viper &quot;(Bothrops jararaca)&quot;, which was a “collected-product inhibitor” of the converting enzyme. Captopril was developed from this peptide after it was found via QSAR-based modification that the terminal sulfhydryl moiety of the peptide provided a high potency of ACE inhibition.

Captopril gained FDA approval on April 6, 1981. The drug became a generic medicine in the U.S. in February 1996, when the market exclusivity held by Bristol-Myers Squibb for captopril expired.

==Chemical synthesis==
A chemical synthesis of captopril by treatment of -proline with (2S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl chloride under basic conditions (NaOH), followed by aminolysis of the protective acetyl group to unmask the drug&#x27;s free thiol, is depicted in the figure at right.

Procedure 2 taken out of patent US4105776. See examples 28, 29a and 36.

==Mechanism of action==
Captopril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and prevents the degradation of vasodilatory prostaglandins, thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction and promoting systemic vasodilation.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Unlike the majority of ACE inhibitors, captopril is not administered as a prodrug (the only other being lisinopril). About 70% of orally administered captopril is absorbed. Bioavailability is reduced by presence of food in stomach. It is partly metabolised and partly excreted unchanged in urine. Captopril also has a relatively poor pharmacokinetic profile. The short half-life necessitates dosing two or three times per day, which may reduce patient compliance. Captopril has a short half-life of 2–3 hours and a duration of action of 12–24 hours.

<text>Carlos Antonio de Padua Chávez y Ramírez (13 June 1899 – 2 August 1978) was a Mexican composer, conductor, music theorist, educator, journalist, and founder and director of the Mexican Symphonic Orchestra. He was influenced by native Mexican cultures. Of his six symphonies, the second, or &quot;Sinfonía india&quot;, which uses native Yaqui percussion instruments, is probably the most popular.

==Biography==

The seventh child of a criollo family, Chávez was born on Tacuba Avenue in Mexico City, near the suburb of Popotla. His paternal grandfather, José María Chávez Alonso, a former governor of the state of Aguascalientes, had been executed by the French Army in April 1864 during its second invasion of Mexico. His father, Augustín Chávez, who died when Carlos was barely three years old, invented a plough that was produced and used in the United States.

Carlos had his first piano lessons from his brother Manuel, and later on he was taught piano by Asunción Parra, Manuel Ponce, and Pedro Luis Ozagón, and harmony by Juan Fuentes. His family often holidayed in Tlaxcala, Michoacán, Guanajuato, Oaxaca, and other places where the cultural influence of the Mexican indigenous peoples was still very strong.

In 1916, Chávez and friends started a cultural journal, &quot;Gladios&quot;, and this led to his joining the staff of the Mexico City newspaper in 1924. In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper.

After the Mexican Revolution and the installation of a democratically elected president, Álvaro Obregón, Chávez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on Aztec themes.

In September 1922, Chávez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in Vienna, five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris. During the latter visit he met Paul Dukas. Some months later, in December 1923, Chávez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924. Chávez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928. Upon his return to Mexico, Chávez became director of the Orquesta Sinfónica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinfónica de México (Mexico&#x27;s Symphonic Orchestra); the country&#x27;s first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians&#x27; labor union. Chávez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico&#x27;s rural areas.

In December 1928, Chávez was appointed director of Mexico&#x27;s National Conservatory of Music—a position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Chávez spearheaded three , two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales.

In 1937, Chávez published a book, &quot;Toward a New Music&quot;, which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about electronic music. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, during a period of absence by the orchestra&#x27;s regular conductor, Arturo Toscanini. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, and by 1945, Chávez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor.

From January 1947 until 1952, Chávez served as director-general of the National Institute of Fine Arts. In his first year, he formed the National Symphony Orchestra, which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico&#x27;s premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Chávez maintained a busy international touring schedule.
In May 1953 he was commissioned by Lincoln Kirstein, director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by Chester Kallman based on a story by Boccaccio, to be titled &quot;The Tuscan Players&quot;. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to &quot;Pánfilo and Lauretta&quot;, then to . The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title &quot;Panfilo and Lauretta&quot; in the Brander Matthews Theatre at Columbia University in New York on 9 May 1957, under the baton of Howard Shanet. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were Sylvia Stahlman, Frank Porretta, Craig Timberlake, Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and Thomas Stewart. The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to (&quot;The Visitors&quot;), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and Aptos, California, respectively.() From 1958 to 1959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at Harvard University, and the public lectures he gave there were published as a book, &quot;Musical Thought&quot;.

From 1970 to 1973, Chávez served as the music director of the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music. His orchestral composition &quot;Discovery&quot; (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there.

Failing health and financial setbacks forced Chávez to sell his house in the Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in Coyoacán, in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978, his wife having died in April.

Chávez&#x27;s manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and in the National Archive of Mexico, in Mexico City.

==Musical style==
Chávez&#x27;s music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The juvenilia, up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially Romantic, with Robert Schumann as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the Aztec-themed ballet (&quot;The New Fire&quot;), followed by a second ballet, (&quot;The Four Suns&quot;), in 1925.

During his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Chávez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: for piano (&quot;Polygons&quot;, 1923), for voice and piano (&quot;Hexagons&quot;, 1924), &quot;36&quot; for piano (1925), for nine instruments (&quot;Energy&quot;, 1925), for violin and piano (&quot;Spiral&quot;, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled (&quot;Pyramids&quot;).

The culmination of this period was the ballet &quot;H. P.&quot; (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title (1926–31). &quot;H. P.&quot; is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of Stravinsky and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the sandunga, tango, huapango, and foxtrot. Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the of 1935–36, one of the few works by Chávez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions. Diego Rivera designed the sets and costumes for the ballet&#x27;s premiere in Philadelphia in 1932.

Although this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Chávez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the sonata, quartet, symphony, and concerto. He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled (1933), was reworked from incidental music for Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot;, an adaptation of Sophocles&#x27; tragedy. In it, Chávez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments.

In the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958–59, titled &quot;Repetition in Music&quot;, he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which &quot;The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral ...&quot; A notable early example of this method is &quot;Soli I&quot; (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with &quot;Invención I&quot; for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: &quot;Invención II&quot; for string trio (1965), &quot;Invención III&quot; for harp (1967), &quot;Soli II&quot; for wind quintet (1961), &quot;Soli III&quot; for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), &quot;Soli IV&quot; for brass trio (1966), &quot;Cinco Caprichos&quot; for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works &quot;Resonancias&quot; (1964), &quot;Elatio&quot; (1967), &quot;Discovery&quot; (1969), &quot;Clio&quot; (1969), and &quot;Initium&quot; (1970–72).

==Recordings==

Chávez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for RCA Victor, containing Chávez&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonía de Antígona&quot; and &quot;Sinfonía India&quot;, together with his orchestration of Dieterich Buxtehude&#x27;s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Red Seal M 503. The best-known of his discs was the Everest Records stereophonic recording of his &quot;Sinfonía India&quot;, &quot;Sinfonía de Antígona&quot;, and &quot;Sinfonía romántica&quot;, in which Chávez conducted the Stadium Symphony Orchestra, the name given to the New York Philharmonic for its summer performances in the Lewisohn Stadium. The album was originally issued in 1959 by Everest Records on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by Philips Records. In 1963 Chávez conducted the Vienna State Opera Orchestra in two recordings with pianist Eugene List for Westminster Records, both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by Edward MacDowell (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). 

In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca Records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinfónica de México. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by Varèse Sarabande on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from &quot;La hija de Cólquide&quot; (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfión and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfión AM 4), and in 1956 Decca released an anthology, &quot;Music of Mexico&quot;, on which he conducted three of his own works, plus José Pablo Moncayo&#x27;s &quot;Huapango&quot; (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). 

He also made some recordings for Columbia Records which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, with the Orquesta Sinfónica de México and Carlos Pellicer, narrator, released on Mexican Columbia MC 1360.

<doc id="559225" wikidata="Q918279" url="?curid=559225" title="John Marston (playwright)">
<text>John Marston (baptised 7 October 1576 – 25 June 1634) was an English playwright, poet and satirist during the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean periods. His career as a writer lasted only a decade. His work is remembered for its energetic and often obscure style, its contributions to the development of a distinctively Jacobean style in poetry, and its idiosyncratic vocabulary.

==Life==
Marston was born to John and Maria Marston &quot;née&quot; Guarsi, and baptised 7 October 1576, at Wardington, Oxfordshire. His father was an eminent lawyer of the Middle Temple who first argued in London and then became the counsel to Coventry and ultimately its steward. John Marston entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1592 and received his BA in 1594. By 1595, he was in London, living in the Middle Temple, where he had been admitted a member three years previously. He had an interest in poetry and play writing, although his father&#x27;s will of 1599 expresses the hope that he would give up such vanities. He married Mary Wilkes in 1605, daughter of the Reverend William Wilkes, one of King James&#x27;s chaplains.

Marston&#x27;s brief career in literature began with a foray into the then-fashionable genres of erotic epyllion and satire. In 1598, he published &quot;The Metamorphosis of Pigmalion&#x27;s Image and Certaine Satyres&quot;, a book of poetry in imitation of, on the one hand, Ovid, and, on the other, the &quot;Satires&quot; of Juvenal. He also published another book of satires, &quot;The Scourge of Villanie&quot;, in 1598. (Marston issued these satires under the pseudonym &quot;W. Kinsayder.&quot;) The satire in these books is even more savage and misanthropic than was typical for the decade&#x27;s satirists. Marston&#x27;s style is, moreover, in places contorted to the point of unintelligibility: he believed that satire should be rough and obscure, perhaps because he thought (as did many other writers of the time) that the term &#x27;satire&#x27; was derived from the Greek &#x27;satyr plays&#x27;. Marston seems to have been enraged by Joseph Hall&#x27;s claim to be the first satirist in English; Hall comes in for some indirect flyting in at least one of the satires. Some see William Shakespeare&#x27;s Thersites and Iago, as well as the mad speeches of King Lear as influenced by &quot;The Scourge of Villanie&quot;. Marston had, however, arrived on the literary scene as the fad for verse satire was to be checked by censors. The Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft banned the &quot;Scourge&quot; and had it publicly burned, along with copies of works by other satirists, on 4 June 1599.

===Playwriting with Henslowe===
In September 1599, John Marston began to work for Philip Henslowe as a playwright. Following the work of O. J. Campbell, it has commonly been thought that Marston turned to the theatre in response to the Bishops&#x27; Ban of 1599; more recent scholars have noted that the ban was not enforced with great rigor and might not have intimidated prospective satirists at all. At any rate, Marston proved a good match for the stage—not the public stage of Henslowe, but the &quot;private&quot; playhouses where boy players performed racy dramas for an audience of city gallants and young members of the Inns of Court. Traditionally, though without strong external attribution, &quot;Histriomastix&quot; has been regarded as his first play; performed by either the Children of Paul&#x27;s or the students of the Middle Temple in around 1599, it appears to have sparked the War of the Theatres, the literary feud between Marston, Jonson and Dekker that took place between around 1599 and 1602. In c. 1600, Marston wrote &quot;Jack Drum&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; and &quot;Antonio and Mellida&quot;, and in 1601 he wrote &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, a sequel to the latter play; all three were performed by the company at Paul&#x27;s. In 1601, he contributed poems to Robert Chester&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr.&quot; For Henslowe, he may have collaborated with Dekker, Day, and Haughton on &quot;Lust&#x27;s Dominion&quot;.

===Feud with Jonson===

By 1601, he was well known in London literary circles, particularly in his role as enemy to the equally pugnacious Ben Jonson. Jonson, who reported to Drummond that Marston had accused him of sexual profligacy, satirized Marston as Clove in &quot;Every Man Out of His Humour&quot;, as Crispinus in &quot;Poetaster&quot;, and as Hedon in &quot;Cynthia&#x27;s Revels&quot;. Jonson criticised Marston for being a false poet, a vain, careless writer who plagiarised the works of others and whose own works were marked by bizarre diction and ugly neologisms. For his part, Marston may have satirized Jonson as the complacent, arrogant critic Brabant Senior in &quot;Jack Drum&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; and as the envious, misanthropic playwright and satirist Lampatho Doria in &quot;What You Will&quot;.

&quot;The Return from Parnassus (II)&quot;, a satirical play performed at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1601 and 1602, characterised Marston as a poet whose writings see him &quot;pissing against the world&quot;.

If Jonson can be trusted, the animosity between himself and Marston went beyond the literary. He claimed to have beaten Marston and taken his pistol. However, the two playwrights were reconciled soon after the so-called War; Marston wrote a prefatory poem for Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus&quot; in 1605 and dedicated &quot;The Malcontent&quot; to Jonson. Yet in 1607, he criticized Jonson for being too pedantic to make allowances for his audience or the needs of aesthetics.

===Blackfriars===
Outside of these tensions, Marston&#x27;s career continued to prosper. In 1603, he became a shareholder in the Children of Blackfriars company, at that time known for steadily pushing the allowable limits of personal satire, violence, and lewdness on stage. He wrote and produced two plays with the company. The first was &quot;The Malcontent&quot; in 1603; this satiric tragicomedy is Marston&#x27;s most famous play. This work was originally written for the children at Blackfriars, and was later taken over (perhaps stolen) by the Kings&#x27; Men at the Globe, with additions by John Webster and (perhaps) Marston himself.
Marston&#x27;s second play for the Blackfriars children was &quot;The Dutch Courtesan&quot;, a satire on lust and hypocrisy, in 1604–5. In 1605, he worked with George Chapman and Ben Jonson on &quot;Eastward Ho&quot;, a satire of popular taste and the vain imaginings of wealth to be found in Virginia. Chapman and Jonson were arrested for, according to Jonson, a few clauses that offended the Scots, but Marston escaped any imprisonment. The actual cause of arrest and details of the brief detainment are not certainly known; in the event, charges were dropped.

In 1606, Marston seems to have offended and then soothed King James. First, in &quot;Parasitaster, or, The Fawn,&quot; he satirized the king specifically. However, in the summer of that year, he put on a production of &quot;The Dutch Courtesan&quot; for the King of Denmark&#x27;s visit, with a Latin verse on King James that was presented by hand to the king. Finally, in 1607, he wrote &quot;The Entertainment at Ashby&quot;, a masque for the Earl of Huntingdon. At that point, he stopped his dramatic career altogether, selling his shares in the company of Blackfriars. His departure from the literary scene may have been because of another play, now lost, which offended the king. It seems that the French ambassador complained to King James about the disrespectful treatment of the French court in plays by Chapman performed at Blackfriars. To strengthen his case he added that another play had been performed in which James himself was depicted drunk. Incensed, James suspended performances at Blackfriars and had Marston imprisoned. This suggests that he was the author of the offending play.

===Later life===
After the end of his literary career, he moved into his father-in-law&#x27;s house and began studying philosophy. In 1609, he became a reader at the Bodleian Library at Oxford, was made a deacon on 24 September and a priest on 24 December 1609. Contemporary authors were bemused or surprised by Marston&#x27;s change of career, with several of them commenting on its seeming abruptness. In October 1616, Marston was assigned the living of Christchurch, Hampshire. He died on 24 June 1634, aged 57, in London and was buried in the Middle Temple Church.

Tombs at that time often started with the formulaic &quot;Memoriae Sacrum&quot; (&quot;Sacred to the memory&quot;) followed by the name of the tomb&#x27;s occupant and an account of their achievements even though such words are hubristic and a contradiction to the Christian virtues of modesty. According to Anthony à Wood John Marston&#x27;s tomb stone bore the legend &quot;Oblivioni Sacrum&quot; (&quot;Sacred to Oblivion&quot;), which was probably composed by Marston, and, according to Joshua Scodel, the short &quot;epitaph is thus both self-abasing and witty in its novel inversion of tradition&quot;.

==Reception and criticism==
Marston&#x27;s reputation has varied widely, like that of most of the minor Renaissance dramatists. Both &quot;The Malcontent&quot; and &quot;The Dutch Courtesan&quot; remained on stage in altered forms through the Restoration. The subplot of the latter was converted to a droll during the Commonwealth; after the Stuart Restoration, either Aphra Behn or Thomas Betterton updated the main plot for &quot;The Revenge, or The Match in Newgate&quot;, although this adaptation makes the play both more sentimental and less morally complex. Gerard Langbaine makes a laudatory but superficial comment about Marston in his survey of English dramatic poets.

After the Restoration, Marston&#x27;s works were largely reduced to the status of a curiosity of literary history. The general resemblance of &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot; to &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Marston&#x27;s role in the war of the poets ensured that his plays would receive some scholarly attention, but they were not performed and were not even widely read. Thomas Warton preferred Marston&#x27;s satires to Bishop Hall&#x27;s; in the next century, however, Henry Hallam reversed this judgment. William Gifford, perhaps the eighteenth century&#x27;s most devoted reader of Jonson, called Marston &quot;the most scurrilous, filthy and obscene writer of his time&quot;.

The Romantic movement in English literature resuscitated Marston&#x27;s reputation, albeit unevenly. In his lectures, William Hazlitt praised Marston&#x27;s genius for satire; however, if the romantic critics and their successors were willing to grant Marston&#x27;s best work a place among the great accomplishments of the period, they remained aware of his inconsistency, what Swinburne in a later generation called his &quot;uneven and irregular demesne&quot;.

In the twentieth century, however, a few critics were willing to consider Marston as a writer who was very much in control of the world he creates. T. S. Eliot saw that this &quot;irregular demesne&quot; was a part of Marston&#x27;s world and declared that &quot;It is … by giving us the sense of something behind, more real than any of the personages and their action, that Marston establishes himself among the writers of genius&quot;. Marston&#x27;s tragic style is Senecan and although his characters may appear, on Eliot&#x27;s own admission, &quot;lifeless&quot;, they are instead used as types to convey their &quot;theoretical implications&quot;. Eliot in particular admired &quot;Sophonisba&quot; and saw how Marston&#x27;s plays, with their apparently stylised characters and bitter portrayal of a world where virtue and honour only arouse &quot;dangerous envy&quot; (&quot;Sophonisba&quot;; Act 1, scene 1, line 45) in those around them, actually bring to life &quot;a pattern behind the pattern into which the characters deliberately involve themselves: the kind of pattern which we perceive in our own lives only at rare moments of inattention and detachment&quot;.

<text>Automatic for the People is the eighth studio album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on October 5, 1992, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and on the following day in the United States, by Warner Bros. Records. R.E.M. began production on the album while their previous album, &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1991), was still ascending charts and achieving global success. Aided by strings arranged by John Paul Jones and conducted by George Hanson, &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; features ruminations on mortality, loss, mourning, and nostalgia.

Upon release, the album received widespread acclaim from critics, reached number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and yielded six singles. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Paul Evans concluded of the album, &quot;This is the members of R.E.M. delving deeper than ever; grown sadder and wiser, the Athens subversives reveal a darker vision that shimmers with new, complex beauty.&quot; &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; has sold more than 18million copies worldwide.

==Background and recording==
What would become &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; had its origins in the mixing sessions for R.E.M.&#x27;s previous album &quot;Out of Time&quot;, held at Paisley Park Studios in December 1990. There, demos for &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Nightswimming&quot; were recorded. After finishing promotional duties for &quot;Out of Time&quot;, the members of R.E.M. began formal work on their next album. Starting the first week of June 1991, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry met several times a week in a rehearsal studio to work on new material. Once a month they would take a week-long break. The musicians would often trade instruments: Buck would play mandolin, Mills would play piano or organ, and Berry would play bass. Buck explained that writing without drums was productive for the band members. The band, intent on delivering an album of harder-rocking material after &quot;Out of Time&quot;, made an effort to write some faster rock songs during rehearsals, but came up with less than a half-dozen prospective songs in that vein.

The musicians recorded the demos in their standard band configuration. According to Buck, the musicians recorded about 30 songs. Lead singer Michael Stipe was not present at these sessions; instead, the band gave him the finished demos at the start of 1992. Stipe described the music to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; early that year as &quot;[v]ery mid-tempo, pretty fucking weird [...] More acoustic, more organ-based, less drums&quot;. In February, R.E.M. recorded another set of demos at Daniel Lanois&#x27; Kingsway Studios in New Orleans.

The group decided to create finished recordings with co-producer Scott Litt at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, starting on March 30. The band recorded overdubs in Miami and New York City. String arrangements were recorded in Atlanta. After recording sessions were completed in July, the album was mixed at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle. &quot;The countermelody I sing on &#x27;Try Not to Breathe&#x27; is one of my favorites because everybody else left,&quot; Mills explained in 2023. &quot;I&#x27;m in the studio and looking in the control room — I know there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s going to be good in this spot of the song. I try all these different things and I&#x27;m not finding it. And then I hit the right thing and I locked eyes with Scott McCaughey from 40 feet away. We just both knew that was the direction. It was very thrilling to have that moment.&quot; Seattle-based McCaughey spent time with the band while they were at Bad Animals Studio.

==Music and lyrics==
Despite R.E.M.&#x27;s initial desire to make an album of rocking, guitar-dominated songs after &quot;Out of Time&quot;, music critic David Fricke noted that instead &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; &quot;seems to move at an even more agonized crawl&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous release. Peter Buck took the lead in suggesting the new direction for the album. The album dealt with themes of loss and mourning inspired by &quot;that sense of [...] turning 30&quot;, according to Buck. &quot;The world that we&#x27;d been involved in had disappeared, the world of Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, all that had gone [...] We were just in a different place and that worked its way out musically and lyrically.&quot; &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot;, and &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot; in particular expressed much darker themes than any of the band&#x27;s previous material and &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot; is about Stipe&#x27;s grandmother dying.

The songs &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, and &quot;Nightswimming&quot; feature string arrangements by former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Of the fourteen classical musicians, eleven were members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, which had also been used on &quot;Out of Time&quot;. Fricke stated that &quot;ballads, in fact, define the record&quot;, and noted that the album featured only three &quot;rockers&quot;: &quot;Ignoreland&quot;, &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;, and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.

&quot;It pretty much went according to plan,&quot; Litt reported. &quot;Compared to &quot;Monster&quot;, it was a walk in the park. &quot;Out of Time&quot; had an orchestral arrangement—so, when we did &quot;Automatic&quot;, judging where Michael was going with the words, we wanted to scale it down and make it more intimate.&quot;

&quot;Song by song [...] the whole album is referencing the 1970s,&quot; recalls Stipe. &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; was inspired by Nazareth&#x27;s cover of &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. &quot;Drive&quot; was an homage to David Essex and &quot;Rock On&quot;, especially that song&#x27;s early glam rock production style.

==Packaging==

The album name refers to the motto of Athens, Georgia-based eatery Weaver D&#x27;s Delicious Fine Foods. The photograph on the front cover is not related to the restaurant; rather, it shows a star ornament (a so-called &quot;Sputnik star&quot; that was common in the 1960s) that was part of the sign for the Sinbad Motel on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami, near Criteria Studios, where the bulk of the album was recorded. The motel is still there, but the star is not since it was damaged during Hurricane Andrew. The slanted support where it was once attached is still present. &quot;The album was going to be called &quot;Star&quot; at one point, hence the object on the cover that Michael had photographed and really dug,&quot; Scott Litt told &quot;Mojo&quot;. &quot;It helps to have some kind of focus in the studio, so the photo was stuck up.&quot; The star photograph is placed over an embossed image, which is also included inside the album&#x27;s booklet distorted on a white background.

The interior jacket shows a two–three story circular platform that was the sign for the old Bon Aire Motel on the former Motel Row on Miami Beach. The Bon Aire and other motel row establishments have mostly been demolished for new high-rise condominiums.

The back cover features a photograph of an old building with the track listing written over at the same angle from which the building is viewed. Other photographs, taken by Anton Corbijn, feature the band members on a beach.

The compact disc release was originally issued in a jewel case with a translucent yellow CD tray, traded out with a then-standard opaque black tray on later pressings; the cassette shell was also issued with the same color. The yellow was made to match the color of the CD. The band would later use a similar method for their 1994 album &quot;Monster&quot;, which was released with a metallic orange CD tray on early copies (though this matched the album cover).

==Release==

&quot;Automatic for the People&quot; was released in October 1992. In the United States, the album reached No.2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts. The album reached No.1 in the United Kingdom, where it topped the UK Albums Chart on four separate occasions. Despite not having toured after the release of &quot;Out of Time&quot;, R.E.M. again declined to tour in support of this album. &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; has been certified four times platinum in the US (four million copies shipped), six times platinum in the United Kingdom (1.8 million shipped), and three times platinum in Australia (210,000 shipped). The album has sold 3.52million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan sales figures . In 1993, the album has sold 1.7 million copies in the US, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s lists of 1993&#x27;s best-selling albums domestically.

&quot;Automatic for the People&quot; yielded six singles over the course of 1992 and 1993: &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, &quot;Nightswimming&quot; and &quot;Find the River&quot;. Lead single &quot;Drive&quot; was the album&#x27;s highest-charting domestic hit, reaching No.28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Other singles charted higher overseas: &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; charted in the top ten on the United Kingdom singles chart, Canada, and Australia.

A live, harder, version of &quot;Drive&quot; appears on the &quot;Alternative NRG&quot;, recorded at Athens&#x27; 40 Watt Club on November19, 1992, during an invitation-only concert supporting Greenpeace Action. A re-recorded, slower version of &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot;, featuring William S. Burroughs, was released on &quot;Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files&quot; in 1996.

The music videos from the album were included in the 1995 video release &quot;Parallel&quot;.

In 2005, Warner Bros. Records issued a two-disc edition of &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; which includes a CD, a DVD-Audio disc containing a 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album done by Elliot Scheiner, and the original CD booklet with expanded liner notes.

A 25th anniversary edition was released on November10, 2017, by Craft Recordings, featuring four discs of live recordings, demos, and the album remixed in Dolby Atmos, making &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; the first music release on this format.

==Critical reception and legacy==
The album received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. R.E.M. biographer David Buckley wrote, &quot;&quot;Automatic for the People&quot; is regarded by Peter Buck and Mike Mills, and by most critics, as being the finest R.E.M. album ever recorded.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album five stars. Reviewer Paul Evans wrote, &quot;Despite its difficult concerns, most of &quot;Automatic&quot; is musically irresistible.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer Allan Jones commented, &quot;It&#x27;s almost impossible to write about the record without mentioning the recent grim rumours concerning Stipe&#x27;s health&quot;, in reference to the rumors at the time that the singer was dying of AIDS or cancer. Jones concluded his review by noting, &quot;Amazingly, initial reactions to &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; in this particular vicinity have been mixed. [...] Psshaw to them. &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; is R.E.M. at the very top of their form.&quot; Ann Powers, reviewing the album for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted that only three of the songs on the album went beyond mid-tempo and said, &quot;Only &#x27;Man on the Moon&#x27; shines with a wit that balances R.E.M.&#x27;s somber tendencies.&quot; Powers finished her review by saying, &quot;Even in the midst of such disenchantment, R.E.M. can&#x27;t resist its own talent for creating beautiful and moving sounds. [...] Buck, Mills and Berry can still conjure melodies that fall like summer sunlight. And Stipe still possesses a gorgeous voice that cannot shake its own gift for meaning.&quot; Guy Garcia, for &quot;Time&quot;, also noted the album&#x27;s themes of &quot;hopelessness, anger and loss&quot;. Garcia added that the album proves &quot;that a so-called alternative band can keep its edge after conquering the musical mainstream&quot; and that it &quot;manages to dodge predictability without ever sounding aimless or unfocussed.&quot;

&quot;Automatic for the People&quot; placed third in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop year-end critics&#x27; poll. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau later gave the album a three-star honorable mention rating, indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure.&quot; The album was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1994, but lost to Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. It was later ranked number 247 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 249 in a 2012 revised list, and 96 in a 2020 reboot of the list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also ranked it at number18 on its 100 Greatest Albums of the 90s list. It was also voted number 6 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000)&quot;.&quot; In 2006, &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; organised a poll of which, 40,000 people worldwide voted for the 100 best albums ever and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; was placed at number 37 on the list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m not so crazy about &#x27;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&#x27;,&quot; Buck reflected in 2001, &quot;but overall I think it sounds great.&quot; Buck added in 2003, in regard to the song, &quot;We included this song on &quot;Automatic&quot; in order to break the prevailing mood of the album. Given that lyrically the record dealt with mortality, the passage of time, suicide and family, we felt that a light spot was needed. In retrospect, the consensus among the band is that this might be a little too lightweight.&quot;

 In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; a &quot;nakedly emotional album consumed by the anxiety of aging, the inevitability of death, the loss of innocence, and the impossibility of holding on to the past&quot;; in 2022, they ranked this album the 63rd best of the 1990s. According to Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot;, R.E.M.&#x27;s achievement on &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; &quot;was to wear their craft on their sleeve, making everything Michael Stipe sang sound both homespun and hard-won – a distillate of a decade making music and a lifetime hearing it.&quot;

<text>Henry Grimes (November 3, 1935 – April 15, 2020) was an American jazz double bassist and violinist.

After more than a decade of activity and performance, notably as a leading bassist in free jazz, Grimes completely disappeared from the music scene by 1970. Grimes was often presumed to have died, but he was discovered in 2002 and returned to performing.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Henry Alonzo Grimes was born in Philadelphia, to parents who both had been musicians in their youth. He took up the violin at the age of 12, and then began playing tuba, English horn, percussion, finally switching to the double bass at Mastbaum Technical High School. He furthered his musical studies at Juilliard and established a reputation as a versatile bassist by the mid-1950s.

Grimes recorded or performed with pianist Lennie Tristano and saxophonists Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan and Sonny Rollins, pianists Thelonious Monk and McCoy Tyner, singer Anita O&#x27;Day, clarinetist Benny Goodman and many others. When bassist Charles Mingus was experimenting with a second bass player in his band, Grimes was the person he selected for the job. One of his earliest appearances on film is captured in the Bert Stern documentary on the Newport Jazz Festival of 1958, &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;. Grimes was 22 years old, and as word spread among the musicians about his extraordinary playing, he ended up playing with six different groups in the festival that weekend: those of Benny Goodman, Lee Konitz, Thelonious Monk, Gerry Mulligan, Sonny Rollins, and Tony Scott. And though Henry&#x27;s name never even appeared in the festival&#x27;s printed program, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther took note of the remarkable young bassist and listed him as one of the festival&#x27;s primary players.

Gradually growing interested in the burgeoning free jazz movement, Grimes performed with most of the music&#x27;s important names, including pianist Cecil Taylor, trumpeter Don Cherry, saxophonists Steve Lacy, Pharoah Sanders, Archie Shepp, and Albert Ayler. He released one album, &quot;The Call&quot;, as a trio leader for the ESP-Disk record label in 1966. The album features Perry Robinson on clarinet and drummer Tom Price and is considered to be representative of his career at that time.

=== Disappearance and return ===

In the late 1960s, Grimes&#x27;s career came to a halt after his move to California. It was commonly assumed Grimes had died; he was listed as such in several jazz reference works. Then Marshall Marrotte, a social worker and jazz fan, set out to discover Grimes&#x27;s fate once and for all. In 2002, he found Grimes alive but nearly destitute, without a bass to play, renting a tiny apartment in Los Angeles, California, writing poetry and doing odd jobs to support himself. He had fallen out of touch with the jazz world and was unaware Albert Ayler had died in 1970 but was eager to perform again. Word spread of Grimes&#x27;s return, and some musicians and fans offered their help. Bassist William Parker donated a bass (nicknamed &quot;Olive Oil&quot; for its distinctive greenish color) and with David Gage&#x27;s help had it shipped from New York to Los Angeles, and others assisted with travel expenses and arranging performances. Grimes&#x27;s return was featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and on National Public Radio. A biography, &quot;Music to Silence to Music&quot;, was published by Northway Books in London in 2015.

Making up for lost time, Grimes performed at more than two dozen music festivals or other appearances in 2003. He received a returning hero&#x27;s welcome at the free jazz-oriented Vision Festival, and began teaching lessons and workshops for bassists. His November 2003 appearance on trumpeter Dennis González&#x27; &quot;Nile River Suite&quot; was the bassist&#x27;s second recording in more than 35 years, the first being a JazzNewYork recording of a solo concert that Grimes played on the air from WKCR-FM&#x27;s studios at Columbia University in New York within weeks of his return to New York. In 2004, he recorded as leader with David Murray and Hamid Drake; and in 2005 with guitarist Marc Ribot, who also wrote an introduction to Grimes&#x27; first book, &quot;Signs Along the Road&quot;, published in March 2007 by buddy&#x27;s knife jazzedition in Cologne, Germany, a collection of Grimes&#x27; poetry in which he presents his selection of entries from thousands of pages of his writings during the long years he was not playing music. Also in 2007, Grimes recorded with drummer Rashied Ali, with whom he played a half-dozen duo concerts and a trio with Marilyn Crispell, and in 2008 with Paul Dunmall and Andrew Cyrille, a co-leader trio called the Profound Sound Trio, among others. Following his return in 2003, Grimes played at many venues around New York City and on tour in the United States, Canada, and 30 countries in Europe, the Far East, and Brazil, often working as a leader, making music with Rashied Ali, Marshall Allen, Fred Anderson, Marilyn Crispell, Ted Curson, Andrew Cyrille, Bill Dixon, Dave Douglas, Andrew Lamb, Joe Lovano, Roscoe Mitchell, William Parker, High Priest (from Anti-Pop Consortium), Wadada Leo Smith, Cecil Taylor (with whom Grimes resumed playing in October, 2006 after 40 years), John Tchicai, and many others.

In 2011, the Chelsea Art Museum hosted a re-creation of the performance &quot;Black Zero&quot;, a happening created in the 1960s by pioneering media artist Aldo Tambellini. Tambellini performed the multi-media piece on several occasions between 1965 and 1968, often in collaboration with jazz musicians such as Bill Dixon and Cecil McBee. The performance at the Chelsea Art Museum was produced by Swiss conceptual artist Christoph Draeger, who invited Grimes to join. Grimes played with Ben Morea, accompanying simultaneous slide and film projections by Aldo Tambellini and sound recordings of the late Calvin Hernton&#x27;s radical poetry. In all, between Henry Grimes&#x27;s return to the music world in 2003 and his 80th year, 2016, he played more than 640 concerts, including many festivals, in 30 countries.

In his last years, Grimes also held a number of residencies and offered workshops and master classes on major campuses, including City College of New York, Berklee College of Music, Hamilton College, New England Conservatory, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, Humber College, and more. He released or played on a dozen new recordings, made his professional debut on a second instrument (the violin) at Cecil Taylor&#x27;s side at Lincoln Center at the age of 70, and had been creating illustrations to accompany his new recordings and publications. Grimes received many honors in recent years, including four Meet the Composer grants. He can be heard on nearly 90 recordings on various labels, including Atlantic, Ayler Records, Blue Note, Columbia, ESP-Disk, ILK Music, Impulse!, JazzNewYork Productions, Pi Recordings, Porter Records, Prestige, Riverside, and Verve. Grimes was a resident of New York City and had a busy schedule of performances, clinics, and international tours.

On June 7, 2016, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Arts for Art/Vision Festival on opening day at Judson Memorial Church in New York City. He stopped performing in 2018, with the relentless progression of the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease causing severe disabilities.

=== Death ===
Henry Grimes died on April 15, 2020, at the age of 84 from complications of COVID-19. His wife, Margaret Davis-Grimes confirmed the date of his death and its cause to the Jazz Foundation of America.

<text>Geoffrey Fitz Peter, Earl of Essex (c. 1162–1213) was a prominent member of the government of England during the reigns of Richard I and John. The patronymic is sometimes rendered Fitz Piers, for he was the son of Piers de Lutegareshale (born 1134, Cherhill, Wiltshire, died 14 January 1179, Pleshy, Essex), a forester of Ludgershall and Maud de Manderville (born 1138, Rycott, Oxford, England).

==Life==

He was from a modest landowning family that had a tradition of service in mid-ranking posts under Henry II. Geoffrey&#x27;s elder brother, Simon Fitz Peter, was at various times High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. Geoffrey, too, got his start in this way, as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for the last five years of Henry II&#x27;s reign.

Around this time Geoffrey married Beatrice de Say, daughter and eventual co-heiress of William de Say II. This William was the elder son of William de Say I and Beatrice, sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex. This connection with the Mandeville family was later to prove unexpectedly important. In 1184, Geoffrey&#x27;s father-in-law died, and he received a share of the de Say inheritance by right of his wife, co-heiress to her father. He also eventually gained the title of earl of Essex by right of his wife, becoming the 4th earl.

When Richard I left on crusade, he appointed Geoffrey one of the five judges of the king&#x27;s court, and thus a principal advisor to Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, who, as Chief Justiciar, was one of the regents during the king&#x27;s absence. Late in 1189, Geoffrey&#x27;s wife&#x27;s cousin William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex died, leaving no direct heirs. His wife&#x27;s inheritance was disputed between Geoffrey and Beatrice&#x27;s uncle, Geoffrey de Say, but Geoffrey Fitz Peter used his political influence to eventually obtain the Mandeville lands (although not the earldom, which was left open) for himself.

He served as Constable of the Tower of London from 1198 to 1205. He served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1198 to 1201, and again in 1203, and as High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire from 1200 to 1205. 

On 11 July 1198, King Richard appointed Geoffrey Chief Justiciar, which at that time effectively made him the king&#x27;s principal minister. On his coronation day the new king ennobled Geoffrey as Earl of Essex.

King John granted Berkhamsted Castle to Geoffrey; the castle had previously been granted as a jointure palace to Queen Isabel prior to the annulment of the royal marriage. Geoffrey founded two hospitals in Berkhamsted, one dedicated to St John the Baptist and one to St John the Evangelist; the latter is still commemorated in the town with the name St John&#x27;s Well Lane.

After the accession of King John, Geoffrey continued in his capacity as the king&#x27;s principal minister until his death on 14 October 1213.

==Marriage and issue==

===Spouses===
*m1. Beatrice de Say, daughter of William de Say and heiress of the Mandeville Earls of Essex.
*m2. Aveline de Clare, daughter of Roger de Clare, 2nd Earl of Hertford.

===Children of Beatrice===
Note that his sons by this marriage took the de Mandeville surname.
*Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex.
*William FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex.
*Henry Fitz Geoffrey, Dean of Wolverhampton.
*Maud Fitzgeoffrey, who married Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford.

===Children of Aveline===
*John Fitzgeoffrey, Lord of Shere and Justiciar of Ireland.
*Cecily Fitzgeoffrey.
*Hawise Fitzgeoffrey.

Geoffrey&#x27;s first two sons died without male issue. The earldom had been associated with their mother&#x27;s Mandeville heritage, and the earldom was next granted to the son of their sister Maud and her husband Henry De Bohun instead of their half-brother John.

<doc id="559251" wikidata="Q5439611" url="?curid=559251" title="Featherbedding">
<text>Featherbedding is the practice of hiring more workers than are needed to perform a given job, or to adopt work procedures which appear pointless, complex and time-consuming merely to employ additional workers. The term &quot;make-work&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for featherbedding.

The term &quot;featherbedding&quot; is usually used by management to describe behaviors and rules sought by workers. The term may equally apply to mid- and upper-level management, particularly in regard to top-heavy and &quot;bloated&quot; levels of middle- and upper-level management. Featherbedding has also been occasionally used to describe rent-seeking behavior by corporations in response to economic regulation.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;featherbedding&quot; originally referred to any person who is pampered, coddled, or excessively rewarded. The term originated in the use of feathers to fill mattresses in beds to provide for more comfort. The modern use of the term in the labor relations setting began in the United States railroad industry, which used feathered mattresses in sleeping cars. Railway labor unions, confronted with changing technology that led to widespread unemployment, sought to preserve jobs by negotiating contracts that required employers to compensate workers to do little or no work or required complex and time-consuming work rules so as to generate a full day&#x27;s work for an employee who otherwise would not remain employed.

In a 1965 bulletin the United States Department of Labor referred to &quot;featherbedding&quot; as:
Since the mid-19th century, &quot;featherbedding&quot; has been most commonly used in the labor relations field. Increasingly, the term has come to refer only to work rules or collective bargaining agreements demanded by labor unions.

In nations in which trade union activities are legally defined, legal definitions of featherbedding exist. Such definitions are few in number and tend to be narrowly drawn. For example, the Taft–Hartley Act in the United States defines featherbedding in Section 8(b)(6) as any agreement or union demand for payment of wages for services that are not performed or not to be performed. However, in 1953, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Act&#x27;s definition applies only to payments for workers not to work. Therefore, work rules requiring minimum crew sizes, the assignment of duties to craft workers, and other &quot;make-work&quot; agreements do not constitute featherbedding.

==Economics==
Featherbedding is commonly seen by economists as a solution to &quot;who should bear the burden of technological change?&quot;

Labor economists often argue that featherbedding can be construed as the most economically optimal position from both an employer&#x27;s and employee&#x27;s perspective, since it can be seen as distributing the costs of technological change. Featherbedding only emerges under certain circumstances. Chief among these is that the employer has an exploitable surplus (e.g., profit) to support the practice. Featherbedding also arises where market forces fail and organizations are permitted to be noncompetitive. Under that analysis, corporations (for example) are already inefficient, and featherbedding does not make them more or less so. Featherbedding can, in some circumstances, take excess resources (profits) away from the employer and give them to workers in the form of more income per worker or higher numbers of employees at the same income level. Featherbedding is considered economically efficient because it occurs in the give-and-take of collective bargaining. If employers were relatively strong, unions would be unable to impose featherbedding on them. As the politico-socio-economic strength of each party changes over time, collective bargaining outcomes will as well, enlarging or reducing the number and impact of featherbedding rules on the employer.

More recent political analyses of featherbedding have concluded that featherbedding is not necessarily economically optimal but is better than other forms of bargaining. Under this analysis, the best form of collective bargaining would be one in which the union and employer bargain not only over wages but the level of employment. Most unions in the United States, for example, bargain solely over wages. Bargaining over work rules (featherbedding) as well as wages achieves outcomes close to those reached by bargaining solely over wages, but is better than bargaining over wages alone.

==Non-economic perspectives==
Legal scholars and certain social theorists argue that featherbedding may be an expression of the concept of a job as a property right. Such analysts argue that while the owner or employer has the &quot;right&quot; to extract profit because of his or her investment of capital, the worker has the &quot;right&quot; to extract profit because of his or her investment of labor. Featherbedding, it is argued, arises and becomes a significant problem if the job property right is not part of the legal regime and remains unprotected (such as the United States).

Seizing on economists&#x27; emphasis on power in the workplace, other social theorists conclude that featherbedding is a result of weak labor unions and unenforced and unprotected worker rights. Under that analysis, featherbedding is a response by unions to their weakness, not strength.

Improved workplace employment rights, improved economic policies and less antagonistic labor-management relations, it is argued, would reduce featherbedding.

Others see certain kinds of featherbedding as a corrective for market failure. For example, the delivery of social services is often not quantifiable except in the extreme. When the market is unable to quantify a good or service, the market will fail to price it accurately and so market failure results. In complex organizations, or in those whose inputs and outputs are difficult to quantify, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes featherbedding. For example, defining &quot;quality health care&quot; is problematic, as is defining a &quot;quality education&quot;. In such situations, frontline professional workers place heavy emphasis on work rules and minimums. Many white-collar professionals (particularly, those such as nurses and teachers) and highly skilled craft workers place heavy emphasis on staffing minimums, for example, as a means of ensuring a &quot;high quality&quot; outcome. While some argue that this is an exercise in the professional judgment of such workers, others call that featherbedding and point to the low level of evidence that such rules improve outcomes.

==International perspectives==
===Brazil===
In Brazil, featherbedding is considered endemic in government-owned and private-sector industries. Some analysts argue that featherbedding is a reaction to economic insecurity, and helps stabilize the national economy by spreading wealth.

===France===
In France, featherbedding was encouraged by the nationalized rail transportation system after World War II with a view of reducing the unemployment rate. Also, railway express rates were kept very low. The railroad ran at a huge deficit as a result.

===Japan===
In postwar Japan, featherbedding is uncommon. A post-war consensus emerged among labor unions that featherbedding was not in the best interest of workers, and unions in Japan have tended to avoid the practice. A heavy government emphasis on full employment and a strong social safety net helped reinforce this consensus.

===Sweden===
There are no national, regional, or local statutes or regulations governing labor unions in Sweden. No national bureau or agency oversees or regulates labor relations, and no agency monitors or regulates internal trade union matters. Nevertheless, despite relatively close relationships between employers and unions, featherbedding is almost unknown in Sweden.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, featherbedding is also referred to as &quot;overmanning&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, the Taft–Hartley Act defines and outlaws featherbedding. However, as previously noted, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowly defined featherbedding and left most practices undisturbed.

<doc id="559259" wikidata="Q465345" url="?curid=559259" title="Namdaemun">
<text>Namdaemun (), officially known as the Sungnyemun (), is one of the Eight Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, South Korea. The gate formed the original southern boundary of the city during the Joseon period, although the city has since significantly outgrown this boundary. It is located in Jung District between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza, with the historic 24-hour Namdaemun Market next to the gate.

The gate, dating back to the 14th century, is a historic pagoda-style gateway, and is designated as the first National Treasure of South Korea. It was once one of the three major gateways through Seoul&#x27;s city walls which had a stone circuit of and stood up to high. It was first built in the last year of King Taejo of Joseon&#x27;s reign in 1398, and rebuilt in 1447.

In 2008, the wooden pagoda atop the gate was severely damaged by arson. Restoration work on the gateway started in February 2010 and was completed on 29 April 2013. The gate was reopened on 4 May 2013.

==Name==
The South Korean government, as written in hanja on the wooden structure, officially calls the landmark &quot;Sungnyemun&quot;, even though it has been more commonly known as &quot;Namdaemun&quot; since the Joseon period.

A common belief in Korea is that the name &quot;Namdaemun&quot; was imposed forcibly during the Japanese colonial period, and therefore should not be used. However, Joseon dynasty annals indicate that naming the eight gates of Seoul after their respective directions was common colloquial usage before the Japanese arrived.

Different from the other gates, Sungnyemun&#x27;s tablet has its name written vertically. When the first king of the Joseon dynasty, Yi Seonggye (who reigned from 1335 to 1408), constructed the capital city, he believed that fire would reach to Gyeongbokgung, as well as to the capital city, as Mt. Gwanaksan of Seoul is shaped like fire according to feng shui principles. Sungnyemun&#x27;s name means &quot;fire&quot;, which is from the harmony of the Five Elements and, if written vertically, the Chinese character &quot;fire&quot; looks as if it is providing protection. This was Taejong&#x27;s (1367–1422) first son, Yangnyeongdaegun&#x27;s (1394–1462), famous writing.

==History==
===Before the 2008 fire===
Before the 2008 fire, Namdaemun was the oldest wooden structure in Seoul. The city gate, made of wood and stone with a two-tiered, pagoda-shaped tiled roof, was completed in 1398 and originally used to greet foreign emissaries, control access to the capital city, and keep out Siberian tigers, which have long been gone from the area. Construction began in 1395 during the fourth year of the reign of King Taejo of Joseon and was finished in 1398. The structure was rebuilt in 1447, during the 29th year of King Sejong the Great&#x27;s reign, and has been renovated several times since. It was originally one of three main gates, the others being Dongdaemun (East Gate) and the now-demolished Seodaemun (West Gate) in the Seodaemun District.

It is the location of the Battle of Namdaemun.

In the early part of the 20th century, the city walls that surrounded Seoul were demolished to make the traffic system more efficient. A visit to Seoul by the Crown Prince of Japan prompted the demolition of the walls around Namdaemun, as the prince was deemed to be too exalted to pass through the gateway. The gate was closed to the public in 1907 after the authority constructed an electric tramway nearby. In 1938, Namdaemun was designated as Korean Treasure No. 1 by the Governor-General of Korea.

Namdaemun was extensively damaged during the Korean War and was given its last major repair in 1961, with a completion ceremony held on 14 May 1963. It was given the status of &quot;National Treasure No. 1&quot; on 20 December 1962.

The gate was renovated again in 2005 with the building of a lawn around the gate, before being opened once again to the public with much fanfare on 3 March 2006. During the restoration, 182 pages of blueprints for the gate were made as a contingency against any emergencies which may damage the structure. Three years later, such an emergency arose.

===2008 fire===
At approximately 8:50 p.m. on 10 February 2008, a fire broke out and severely damaged the wooden structure at the top of the Namdaemun gate. The fire roared out of control again after midnight and finally destroyed the structure, despite the efforts of more than 360 firefighters. Many witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man shortly before the fire, and two disposable lighters were found where the fire was believed to have started. A 69-year-old man identified as Chae Jong-gi was arrested on suspicion of arson and later confessed to the crime. A police captain reported that Chae had sprayed paint thinner on the floor of the structure and then set fire to it. Police say that Chae was upset about not being paid in full for land he had sold to developers. The same man had been charged with setting a fire at Changgyeonggung in Seoul in 2006. On 25 April 2008, Chae was convicted and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment by the Seoul Central District Court.

===Restoration===
The Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea said that it would undertake a three-year project that would cost an estimated ₩20 billion (approximately $14 million) to rebuild and restore the historic gate, making it the most expensive restoration project in South Korea. President Lee Myung-bak proposed starting a private donation campaign to finance the restoration of the structure.

By January 2010, 70% of the pavilion gate, the first floor and 80% of the fortress wall had been completed. Work on the roof began in April after the completion of the wooden second floor, with 22,000 roof tiles produced in a traditional kiln in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province. The wall and basic frame were scheduled to be finished in April and May respectively. The pillars and rafters are to be elaborately decorated, with the ornamental patterns and colors based on those used in the large-scale repair in 1963, which was closest to the early-Chosun original.

In January 2013, it was estimated by an official that restoration of the gate would be completed around May 2013. Construction had been delayed by four months due to harsh weather conditions in Seoul. On 17 February 2013, the gate was 96% completed, and all steel-frame scaffolding had been removed. On 29 April 2013, restoration work was completed, and the public opening was scheduled for 4 May 2013, a day before Children&#x27;s Day. It was officially reopened on 5 May 2013, after a five-year restoration period.

Only six months after the restoration was completed, paint started to chip off and wood cracked. President Park Geun-hye ordered an investigation into the matter.

<text>Toadies are an American rock band formed in 1989 in Fort Worth, Texas, best known for the song &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot;. The band&#x27;s classic lineup consisted of Vaden Todd Lewis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Lisa Umbarger (bass guitar), Darrel Herbert (lead guitar), and Mark Reznicek (drums). The band released two studio albums before disbanding in 2001 after Umbarger left the group. The band reformed and released the album &quot;No Deliverance&quot; in 2008. In 2010, they re-released the album &quot;Feeler&quot; with Kirtland Records (the album&#x27;s original release had been denied by Interscope in 1997). The band&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;The Lower Side of Uptown&quot;, was released in September 2017.

==Biography==

===Early years, &quot;Rubberneck&quot;, and commercial breakthrough (1989–1996)===
Toadies began in 1989 in Fort Worth, Texas. They recorded a few cassette self-releases and an EP titled &quot;Pleather&quot; before signing to Interscope Records. Their first full-length album, &quot;Rubberneck,&quot; was released in the summer of 1994. Featuring a sound described as &quot;distinctly grunge&quot; and &quot;distinctly Texan&quot;, &quot;Rubberneck&quot; included six singles, &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Mister Love&quot;, &quot;Away&quot;, &quot;Tyler&quot;, &quot;Backslider&quot; and &quot;I Come From the Water&quot;. &quot;Backslider&quot; can be heard in the film &quot;Black Sheep&quot;. &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot; would later become a playable track in the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;. Interscope did not properly promote the album for its first year on release, calling it a &quot;marketing strategy&quot;, until &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot; became a successful single in late 1995, reaching number nine on the Mainstream Rock Chart.

Toadies toured extensively throughout the 1990s supporting &quot;Rubberneck&quot;, opening for artists such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie, Bush, and The Butthole Surfers. The band also headlined and co-headlined tours with acts such as Supersuckers, and The Reverend Horton Heat. Toadies were a regular act at the festivals Edgefest in Dallas, and Buzzfest in Houston during these years.

===&quot;Feeler&quot; sessions, &quot;Hell Below/Stars Above&quot;, and breakup (1997–2002)===
The band entered the studio in 1997 to record new tracks for a second album, &quot;Feeler&quot;. Interscope Records did not approve the finished product, and rejected its 1998 release. In 2000, they went back to the studio, salvaged some of the songs from the &quot;Feeler&quot; sessions, and released their second full-length album &quot;Hell Below/Stars Above&quot; in the spring of 2001. Portland-based musician Elliott Smith performed piano backup for the title track.

&quot;Hell Below/Stars Above&quot; was not promoted by Interscope and saw poor sales. The band toured in the spring and summer of 2001 in support of the new album, until bassist Lisa Umbarger unexpectedly resigned from the band on July 14, 2001. Umbarger told the Dallas Observer that she resigned after realizing that Interscope Records was not going to promote the band. Vaden Todd Lewis decided to break up the band rather than continue without her, a decision which &quot;stunned&quot; Umbarger. The band played a few farewell shows later that summer, with Mark Hughes filling in for Umbarger, before parting ways after their final show on October 1, 2001.

Shortly after the break-up, a live album, &quot;Best of Toadies: Live from Paradise&quot;, was released. It was recorded earlier in 2001 at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, MA. The album was released through Aezra Records, but Kirtland Records later picked up the band&#x27;s back catalogue.

===&quot;No Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Feeler&quot; release, and &quot;Play.Rock.Music&quot; (2006–2013)===
Toadies reformed for a reunion show on March 11, 2006, headlining the Greenville Avenue St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade concert, drawing in an estimated 100,000 people. In March 2007, they embarked on a mini-tour, playing dates in Austin, Houston, and Dallas. The final show of the mini-tour was recorded and released as the live album &quot;Rock Show&quot;.

The band released its third studio album, &quot;No Deliverance&quot;, on August 19, 2008, via Kirtland Records. The lead single for the album was the title track.

Toadies performed at Lollapalooza on August 2, 2008, Wildflower! Arts and Music Festival on May 16, 2009, and May 18, 2013, and Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 4, 2009. In addition, on August 31, 2008, the Toadies headlined the inaugural Dia De Los Toadies, an annual Texas music festival organized by and featuring the band.

In June 2010 it was announced that &quot;Feeler&quot;, the follow-up album to &quot;Rubberneck&quot; that was shelved by Interscope, would finally be seeing a release. Vaden Todd Lewis was quoted as saying: &quot;Since there are unfinished versions floating around on the Internet, it is important to us that people hear it as we meant it to be.&quot; The band was unable to obtain the original 1997 &quot;Feeler&quot; masters from Interscope, and re-recorded the album in 2010. The album was released on July 20, 2010.

The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Play.Rock.Music&quot;, was released July 31, 2012 on Kirtland Records. A promotional video for the track, &quot;Summer of the Strange,&quot; can be viewed on Clark Vogeler&#x27;s YouTube channel.

===&quot;Rubberneck&quot; 20th-anniversary reissue and tour (2014)===
On January 7, 2014, the Toadies announced via its Facebook page that its &quot;Rubberneck&quot; album would be reissued by Kirtland Records with five previously unreleased bonus tracks. The announcement also revealed plans for a nationwide &quot;Rubberneck&quot; 20-year anniversary tour, featuring the Toadies playing the entire &quot;Rubberneck&quot; album &quot;front to back&quot;, with supporting acts Supersuckers and Battleme. The tour ended in September 2014 with a final &quot;Rubberneck&quot; start to finish performance, followed by performances of the band&#x27;s more recent songs, at the seventh annual Dia De Los Toadies festival in Fort Worth.

===&quot;Heretics&quot; and Summerland Tour (2015)===
In January 2015, Everclear announced its fourth annual multi-city Summerland Tour via Twitter. The 2015 Summerland Tour featured Everclear and Toadies, as well as alternative rock bands American Hi-Fi and Fuel.

In June 2015, Toadies announced that its eighth album, &quot;Heretics&quot;, would be released September 18. The album &quot;re-imagines and reinterprets&quot; several Toadies songs such as &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Backslider,&quot; and featured two new songs and a cover of Blondie&#x27;s 1979 single &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. The Toadies also launched a new tour to promote &quot;Heretics&quot; in the fall of 2015, with the tour starting at the eighth annual Dia De Los Toadies music festival in September 2015.

===&quot;The Lower Side of Uptown&quot; and Tour (2017)===
The Toadies released its ninth album, &quot;The Lower Side of Uptown&quot; on September 8, 2017, via Kirtland Records. 
On September 6, 2017, band members kicked off their fall tour with Local H in Denton, Texas.

=== &quot;Damn You All to Hell&quot; EP &quot;and Rubberneck 25th Anniversary Tour&quot; (2022) ===
Toadies released the EP &quot;Damn You All to Hell&quot; on September 13, 2022, as they began touring North America to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the album &quot;Rubberneck&quot;. The EP is four previously unreleased tracks, including a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &#x27;Sound and Vision.&#x27; Three of the songs were recorded during sessions for the band&#x27;s last studio album T&quot;he Lower Side Of Uptown&quot;, while &#x27;Forgiven&#x27; was recorded during the &quot;No Deliverance&quot; session.

<doc id="559262" wikidata="Q7936152" url="?curid=559262" title="Vision Festival">
<text>The Vision Festival is the world&#x27;s premier festival of experimental music (typically free jazz/avant-garde jazz), art, film and dance, held annually in May/June on the Lower East Side of New York City from 1996 to 2011, in Brooklyn from 2012 to 2014, and returning to Manhattan in 2015. It usually consists of between thirty and sixty performances, spread out over a number of days.

Inspired by the 1984 and 1988 Sound Unity Festivals, it was a direct outgrowth of the seminal but short-lived Improvisors Collective (1994–95). In 1996, the collective&#x27;s founder, dancer-choreographer Patricia Nicholson Parker, staged the first Vision Festival at the Learning Alliance on Lafayette Street, and subsequently founded the not-for-profit Arts for Art, Inc to organize the festival on an annual basis, along with other events and concert series throughout the year.

<text>An adaptive enzyme or inducible enzyme is an enzyme that is expressed only under conditions in which it is clearly of adaptive value, as opposed to a constitutive enzyme which is produced all the time.

The inducible enzyme is used for the breaking-down of things in the cell. It is also a part of the Operon Model, which illustrates a way for genes to turn &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;.
The inducer causes the gene to turn on (controlled by the amount of reactant which turns the gene on). Then there&#x27;s the repressor protein that turns genes off. The inducer can remove this repressor, turning genes back on. The operator is a section of DNA where the repressor binds to shut off certain genes; the promoter is the section of DNA where the RNA polymerase binds. Lastly, the regulatory gene is the gene for the repressor protein.
An example of inducible enzyme is COX-2 which is synthesized in macrophages to produce prostaglandin E2 while the constitutive enzyme COX-1 (another isozyme in COX family) is always produced in variety of organs in body (like stomach).

<text>Ross Alexander Cameron (born 14 May 1965) is an Australian politician who was a Liberal] Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1996 until 2004, representing the division of Parramatta.

Between 2013 and 2018, he was a contributor and host at Sky News Live, including a controversial stint as a co-host of &quot;Outsiders&quot;, before his employment was terminated for racist remarks made on air.

Since 2023, Cameron has served as the president of the New South Wales Libertarian Party.

==Early life==
The son of Jim Cameron, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, he was born in Sydney, New South Wales, grew up in Turramurra in Sydney and was educated at Knox Grammar School and Sydney University. He was a lawyer before entering politics. He was policy adviser and research officer to the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Bruce Baird, and an intern to United States Republican Senator Mark Hatfield.

== Member of Parliament ==
Cameron was elected to parliament in the 1996 Federal election, winning the Division of Parramatta from the sitting Labor member Paul Elliott. A noted orator, he delivered his maiden speech to the House of Representatives without notes. Cameron held the traditionally Labor seat of Parramatta for three terms.

While a member of parliament, Cameron was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services from 2001 to 2003 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Peter Costello) 2003–2004.

Cameron ran regular prayer meetings for politicians in his office in Parliament House. He has also been associated with the American evangelical Christian organisation, The Fellowship.

Mark Latham wrote of Ross Cameron in 1997: &quot;Ross Cameron, the brilliant but creepy Liberal member for Parramatta, has talked me into participating in his youth leadership forum in Canberra. I rather suspect it&#x27;s a front for mobilising Christian soldiers, plus some quality box for Ross&quot;.

Cameron ran an eight-year campaign while in office against the Parliament House contemporary art collection.

===Extramarital affair===

In August 2004, Cameron revealed in an interview in &quot;Good Weekend&quot; that he had an extramarital affair with an &quot;exotic solicitor&quot; while his wife was pregnant with twins. Cameron &quot;was a frequent overnight visitor to the house his mistress shared with a reporter&quot;. In Truth Overboard, journalist Tom Dusevic wrote in Time magazine that once Cameron&#x27;s story was in the public domain &quot;...reporters in Canberra immediately ran with further details of Cameron&#x27;s private life, unleashing stories they&#x27;d been sitting on for years&quot; which included accounts of numerous other affairs which he had failed to disclose in the original interview with Good Weekend.

The admission was considered to be the main reason why he lost his seat at the 2004 Federal election. He was one of only three sitting coalition members to lose their seat at that election.

In 2011 Cameron said he may run for a seat at the next federal election and had discussed the matter with Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, but this did not eventuate.

==Post-parliament==
After his departure from parliament, he joined Macquarie Bank&#x27;s Investment Banking Group, working primarily on partnerships between the public and private sectors. He left Macquarie in 2008.

Cameron was a founder and original board member of MyATM, along with three time undischarged bankrupt Don Fleming (owing $24million in 2010), Kym Weir, Tim Scala and Grant Chapman. According to The Business Spectator he bought 15,787,600 shares for $3,946,900 on 1 April 2010 and 2 April, becoming a substantial shareholder with 15,787,600 shares (7.52%). In a written statement outlining Fleming&#x27;s involvement with the company, Mr Scala said: &quot;Don Fleming founded My ATM jointly with Ross Cameron and myself&quot; Cameron resigned from the board of directors of MyATM four months after the public float, he remains on the board of Aussie ATM and My ATM New Zealand.

From 2013 to 2018, Cameron was a regular contributor to programs on Sky News Australia. In July 2014, Cameron became a co-host alongside Kristina Keneally on weekly panel show &quot;The Contrarians&quot; every Friday afternoon, before the pair were given their own self-titled program &quot;Keneally and Cameron&quot;. This program was axed in March 2015. From 4 December 2016, Cameron began co-hosting &quot;Outsiders&quot; on Sky News.

On a Sky News panel discussion of the Donald Trump &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape in October 2016, Cameron said the whole thing had made him even more pro-Trump and theatrically demonstrated his support by donning an official Trump slogan cap and removing his shirt to reveal an official Trump Pence campaign t-shirt.

In February 2017, Cameron was reported to have spoken as a VIP member at a fundraiser for the far-right Q Society of Australia. In the article, his speech was characterised by having &quot;constantly mentioned homosexuality&quot;, and is quoted to have said &quot;The NSW division of the Liberal Party is basically a gay club... I don&#x27;t mind that they are gay, I just wish, like Hadrian, they would build a wall.&quot; His comments were condemned by Sky News colleagues including David Speers, Peter van Onselen and Kristina Keneally.

Also in February 2017, Cameron was suspended by the Liberal Party&#x27;s NSW state executive for four-and-a-half years, after he gave an interview to the ABC&#x27;s 7.30 Report in which he referred to Liberal Party processes as &quot;corrupt&quot; and called the party &quot;basically a gay club&quot;.

Cameron was sacked by Sky News on 2 November 2018, after making racist remarks on &quot;Outsiders&quot;.

In 2021, Cameron joined the Liberal Democrats.

<doc id="559275" wikidata="Q7182964" url="?curid=559275" title="Philatelic cover">
<text>A philatelic cover is an envelope prepared with a stamp(s) and address and sent through the mail delivery system for the purpose of creating a collectible item. Stamp collectors began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on, and philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward. While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially first day covers and cacheted covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. However, mail sent by stamp collectors is no less a genuine article of postage than is mail sent with no concern of seeing the mailed item again. Philatelic covers include mail from first airmail flight and first day of stamp issues ceremonies. Over the years there have been numerous Expositions where special postmarks are made and where a post office is set up where mail can be sent from on the given date of the Expo&#x27;. Like any other genuine item of mail these covers include postage stamps and postmarks of the time period and were processed and delivered by an official postal system. Often a philatelic cover will have more historical significance than randomly mailed covers as philatelic covers are also often mailed from the location on the date of an important or noteworthy event, like an inauguration or a space launch.

==Types==

The possible kinds of philatelic covers are only limited by the imagination of creative collectors, but there are a number of well-known categories:
* First day covers, mailed on the first day of issue of a stamp.
* Cacheted covers, sent on envelopes with additional artwork, usually relating to the theme of the stamp.
* Covers with special or commemorative cancellations used temporarily by a post office.
* Covers with cancellations from unusual places.
* Covers sent to collect particular postal markings.
* &quot;One of everything&quot; cover, all stamps of a new or old issue affixed to the cover.
* Unnecessary mixed frankings.
* Last day of service of a discontinued post office

==Identifying philatelic covers==

Philatelic covers are normally very easy to spot but sometimes they can escape detection by the inexperienced philatelist. Characteristics include:
*The cover is still sealed and appears to be empty.
*The stamps used are far above that needed for the postal service used.
*The cover is addressed to a well known dealer.
*The stamps include a full set of one particular issue, possibly applied in order of value.
*The stamps are applied very tidily and/or the postmark appears to have been very carefully applied so as not to obscure too much of the stamps.
*The cover bears a cachet or special design, usually on the left side portion of the envelope.
*The address consists of a small rubber stamp or adhesive label in the bottom right hand corner of the cover.
*The cover has a rarely seen combination of stamps, for instance with stamps that were issued many years apart.

While many philatelists prefer genuine commercial covers to philatelically contrived covers, philatelic covers may still be acceptable in collections of countries and eras where few other covers exist. Whether the cover was contrived or not, it is still an item of mail sent through the same postal system as other covers from a given country, with a postage stamp(s) and postmark, and is often more historically significant than covers set with no intention of recovery.

==Famous philatelic covers==
Various types of covers, usually prepared by collectors, historians or other enthusiasts, have great historical significance and, regardless of the intention for the mailed item, are sometimes noteworthy or famous in their own right.

===Zeppelin mail===
Among the most definitive examples of famous or popular philatelic covers is Zeppelin mail. These are covers that were carried aboard zeppelins in the 1930s and bear special postmarks and other special markings. Because the new Zeppelins were the fastest way to get mail delivered across the Atlantic Ocean they carried a great deal of mail. Because of all the fanfare surrounding the Zeppelins most of mail carried aboard were Zeppelin first flight covers. Much of the funding for the Zeppelin delivery system was generated by collectors and other enthusiasts of the period. Because of the fast mail delivery service there was a lot of commercial mail aboard these vessels. Mail service across the Atlantic Ocean was reduced from weeks to a few days. Hindenburg’s 2-1/2 day service was the fastest way to send mail between Europe and North America in 1936.

===First Flight mail===
With the advent of air travel it wasn&#x27;t long before airplanes were carrying the mail between distant points about the globe. In the United States and Germany Air Mail delivery was greeted with the same national enthusiasm and fanfare as was experienced with the first trips to the moon by US Astronauts. Consequently, many people sent philatelic mail to themselves or friends that was carried aboard these flights in order to get a souvenir of the historic event. First flight covers carried aboard are very popular and famous in some cases. The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, and carried mail from Washington, DC, to New York City. The type of airplane used was the U.S. Army Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; biplanes flown by army pilots with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President Woodrow Wilson, U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight, which turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.

<doc id="559282" wikidata="Q1228689" url="?curid=559282" title="Dishwalla">
<text>Dishwalla is an American alternative rock band from Santa Barbara, California. Formed by vocalist J.R. Richards, guitarist Rodney Browning, and keyboardist Greg Kolanek, they were initially known as Life Talking and then Dish upon adding bassist Scot Alexander and drummer George Pendergast.

Due to a cease-and-desist letter, the band settled on Dishwalla in late 1993. The Dishwalla name came from a Hindi term for a person providing satellite TV to a neighborhood (&quot;dish&quot; + walla). Kolanek took the name from a &quot;Wired&quot; magazine article. The band is best known for its 1996 hit song &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and eventual change to Dishwalla (1990–1993)===
J.R. Richards (vocals/rhythm guitar), Rodney Browning (guitar), and Greg Kolanek (keyboards) formed the band Life Talking in 1990. They released one demo album, &quot;By the Color&quot;, in 1991. Unlike their later output, Life Talking was more synthpop and electronic-oriented.

The following year, the band changed its name to Dish as they added Scot Alexander (bass) and George Pendergast (drums) to the lineup. With a full band, their sound shifted into an alternative rock direction. Dish self-released a demo album in 1993, &quot;Dish&quot;, as it featured three songs that were later re-recorded for their major label debut (&quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Parents&quot;, &quot;Give&quot;, and &quot;All She Can See&quot;), one song that was re-recorded from their Life Talking era (&quot;Worthless&quot;), and three exclusive tracks (&quot;The Chair&quot;, &quot;Love Sees No Color&quot;, and &quot;Tear&quot;).

Due to a cease-and-desist letter in August 1993, the band changed their name to Dishwalla. The name was based on a &quot;Wired&quot; magazine article that Kolanek had read, in which the story described a person who provided satellite TV to a neighborhood (&quot;dish&quot; + walla).

===Major label signing and mainstream success with &quot;Pet Your Friends&quot; (1994–1997)===
In 1994, the band recorded &quot;It&#x27;s Going to Take Some Time&quot; on the tribute album &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;, which featured cover versions of songs by The Carpenters. The band made their televised debut, performing the songs &quot;It&#x27;s Going to Take Some Time&quot; and &quot;Moisture&quot;, on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; shortly after. Kolanek departed from the band around the same time, although the reasoning was not explained (he was given songwriting credits on the band&#x27;s subsequent release however). The band continued as a quartet, and they signed a contract with the label A&amp;M Records. Their album &quot;Pet Your Friends&quot; featured producer Phil Nicolo (known as one half of The Butcher Bros.), and it was released in August 1995. Jim Wood was then brought in as the band&#x27;s keyboardist. In 1996, the single &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; from &quot;Pet Your Friends&quot; climbed to No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and topped the Modern Rock Tracks chart, bringing the band mainstream success. Other singles off the album, such as &quot;Give&quot; and &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Parents&quot;, appeared on various charts in both the US and Canada as well.

Initially in 1996, Dishwalla and The Refreshments opened for Goo Goo Dolls on a national tour. Dishwalla and The Refreshments then co-headlined their own tour later in the year. Overall, &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; earned the band a Billboard Award for &quot;Best Rock Song&quot; in 1996 as well as two ASCAP Awards for &quot;Rock Track of the Year&quot; in both 1996 and 1997. &quot;Pet Your Friends&quot; was eventually certified gold by the RIAA.

===Moderate success with &quot;And You Think You Know What Life&#x27;s About&quot; and label shifts (1998–2000)===
Dishwalla released their second album in 1998, &quot;And You Think You Know What Life&#x27;s About&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Once in a While&quot;, managed to appear on both the Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. Both &quot;Once in a While&quot; and &quot;Stay Awake&quot; also respectively peaked at No. 38 and No. 80 on Canada&#x27;s RPM 100 chart. Dishwalla toured with Sheryl Crow in promotion of the album, but Pendergast sustained an injury. Initially, Pete Maloney was brought on as a temporary drummer, but Maloney ended up joining the band on a full-time basis.

Despite some moderate success with &quot;And You Think You Know What Life&#x27;s About&quot;, the album&#x27;s singles did not match the popularity of &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot;; thus, it led to the band being classified as a one-hit wonder of the 1990s. In 1999, the band appeared in a &quot;Charmed&quot; episode (season 2, episode 4). They performed a concert as themselves at &quot;P3&quot;, a fictional night-club, during the episode. That same year, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Find Your Way Back Home&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for the film &quot;American Pie&quot;. Ultimately, the band departed from A&amp;M Records after their touring commitments were finished.

===&quot;Opaline&quot;, &quot;Dishwalla&quot;, and departure of Richards (2001–2005)===
In 2002, Dishwalla released their third album, &quot;Opaline&quot;, on Immergent Records. &quot;Somewhere in the Middle&quot; was released as the lead single, and it peaked at No. 25 on the Adult Pop Songs chart. It was also their only charting single in Australia as it peaked at No. 72 on the ARIA Chart. Dishwalla extensively toured before and after the album&#x27;s release (from fall 2001 to summer 2003), as it was noted that they played 258 shows over 470 days.

The band released the self-titled album &quot;Dishwalla&quot; through Orphanage Records on March 15, 2005. Dishwalla went on a short tour throughout the summer of 2005, and the final shows took place in July of that year. It was ultimately the last album and tour with original vocalist Richards.

===Reformation and &quot;Juniper Road&quot; (2008–2017)===
After deciding to take a break in 2005, the band reformed and began touring in 2008 with a modified lineup consisting of bassist Alexander, guitarist Browning, keyboardist Wood, and drummer Pendergast. The lineup featured long-time friend Justin Fox, singer of the Santa Barbara band Tripdavon, as a &quot;special guest vocalist&quot;. On March 15, 2009, Dishwalla was asked to play a benefit concert for Tea Fire victims Lance and Carla Hoffman, who were badly burned in fires which hit Santa Barbara in November 2008. In September 2012, Dishwalla let it be known that Richards had been permanently replaced with long-time friend and &quot;special guest vocalist&quot; Fox, as Richards focused on his solo albums and production career. In November 2012, in an episode of the TV show &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, Dishwalla and their song &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; was written into a storyline.

In 2013 and 2014, the band toured extensively across the United States and the world. The band shared the stage with many other notable acts such as Eric Burdon, Collective Soul, Vertical Horizon, Tonic, Stroke 9, and Nine Days just in 2014 alone. Although there were initial doubts about Fox&#x27;s ability to take over as frontman, his longevity in the band and continued touring commitments received support by the band&#x27;s fans.

The year 2015 was the 20th anniversary of Dishwalla&#x27;s chart-topping &quot;Pet Your Friends&quot; album that launched their careers. To commemorate the event, the band re-recorded their hit &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; with new vocalist Fox. On July 14, 2017, Dishwalla released their fifth studio album, &quot;Juniper Road&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first full-length studio release in 12 years. During the summer of 2017, the band joined the &quot;Rockin&#x27; Road Trip &#x27;17&quot; tour, sharing the stage with notable acts such as Fuel, Marcy Playground, Gin Blossoms, and others. Their summer dates included an appearance at the Santa Barbara Bowl on September 18, 2017 with Tears for Fears.

===&quot;Alive&quot; and continued career (2018–present)===
Dishwalla released a three-track EP, &quot;Alive&quot;, in 2022. The title track managed to peak at No. 31 on the Mainstream Rock chart, their first appearance on a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 20 years.

<doc id="559283" wikidata="Q244926" url="?curid=559283" title="May 15 incident">
<text>The  was an attempted coup d&#x27;état in the Empire of Japan, on May 15, 1932, launched by reactionary elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy, aided by cadets in the Imperial Japanese Army and civilian remnants of the ultranationalist League of Blood (&quot;Ketsumei-dan&quot;). Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by 11 young naval officers. The following trial and popular support of the Japanese population led to extremely light sentences for the assassins, strengthening the rising power of Japanese militarism and weakening democracy and the rule of law in the Empire of Japan.

==Background==
As a result of the ratification of the London Naval Treaty limiting the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy, a movement grew within the junior officer corps to overthrow the government, and to replace it with military rule. This movement had parallels in the &quot;Sakurakai&quot; secret society organized within the Imperial Japanese Army. The naval officers established contacts with the ultranationalist Nisshō Inoue and his &quot;League of Blood&quot;, and agreed with his philosophy that to bring about a &quot;Shōwa Restoration&quot;, it would be necessary to assassinate leading political and business figures (&quot;Zaibatsu&quot;).

In 1932, in the &quot;blood-pledge corps incident&quot;, Inoue&#x27;s group only managed to kill the former Finance Minister and head of the &quot;Rikken Minseitō,&quot; Inoue Junnosuke, and Director-General of Mitsui Holding Company, Takuma Dan on 9 February and 5 March respectively. While only two high-profile leaders were killed, the group initially planned to assassinate twenty other financial and political leaders.

==Incident==

On May 15, 1932, the naval officers, aided by army cadets, and right-wing civilian elements (including Shūmei Ōkawa, Mitsuru Tōyama, and Kōzaburō Tachibana) staged their own attempt to complete what had been started in the League of Blood incident.

Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot by eleven young naval officers (most were just turning twenty years of age) in the prime minister&#x27;s residence. Inukai&#x27;s last words were roughly to which his killers replied .
The original assassination plan had included killing the English film star Charlie Chaplin who had arrived in Japan on May 14, 1932, at a reception for Chaplin, planned by Prime Minister Inukai. &quot;These activists, eager to inject a nativist Yamato spirit into politics, recognised the charged political nature of mass culture&quot;. Chaplin&#x27;s murder would facilitate war with the U.S., and anxiety in Japan, and lead to &quot;restoration&quot; in the name of the emperor. When the prime minister was killed, his son Inukai Takeru was watching a sumo wrestling match with Charlie Chaplin, which probably saved both their lives.

The insurgents also attacked the residence of Makino Nobuaki, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, head of the Rikken Seiyūkai political party, and tossed hand-grenades into Mitsubishi Bank headquarters in Tokyo, and several electrical transformer substations.

Aside from the murder of the prime minister, the attempted coup d&#x27;état came to nothing, and the rebellion as a whole proved a failure. The participants took a taxi to the police headquarters and surrendered themselves to the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; without a struggle.

==Consequences==
The eleven officers who murdered Prime Minister Inukai were court-martialed. During the proceedings, the accused used the trial as a platform to proclaim their loyalty to the emperor and to arouse popular sympathy by appealing for reforms of the government and economy. By end of the trial, the court had received 110,000 clemency petitions, either signed or written entirely in blood, from sympathizers around the country pleading for a lenient sentence. Additionally, nine youths in Niigata asked to be tried by the court instead of the accused, and sent the court a jar containing nine of their own pickled severed pinky fingers as a gesture of their sincerity.

The punishment handed down by the court was extremely light, and there was little doubt in the Japanese press that the murderers of Prime Minister Inukai would be released in a couple of years, if not sooner. Failure to severely punish the plotters in the May 15 incident further eroded the rule of law and the power of the democratic government in Japan to confront the military. Indirectly, it led to the February 26 incident and the increasing rise of Japanese militarism.

<doc id="559286" wikidata="Q15278" url="?curid=559286" title="Kowloon Tong">
<text>Kowloon Tong() is an area of Hong Kong located in Kowloon. The majority of the area is in the Kowloon City District. Its exact location is south of the Lion Rock, north of Boundary Street, east of the East Rail line and west of Grampian Road. It is one of the most expensive residential districts in Hong Kong.

It is popular among Hong Kong&#x27;s wealthy residents because of its schools and low-density private housing. Most of the buildings there do not exceed 10 floors. In addition, this area is noted for its love hotels and nursing homes. Within Kowloon West, it is administratively divided between Kowloon City District and Sham Shui Po District, bisected by the Kowloon–Canton Railway.
==History==
Kowloon Tong was originally a small village located in present-day Police Sport Association near Boundary Street, south of Woh Chai Hill. The area allowed cultivation based on rivers running down from Beacon Hill.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Kowloon Tong was 185.

In the 1920s, the Hong Kong Government developed the area of east of Kowloon Tong and Kowloon Tsai on both sides of Kowloon–Canton Railway into a low density residential area (based on British town planning of the time). The residential area is thus known as Kowloon Tong. The area&#x27;s roads and streets are largely named after counties in England. It was the home of a large number of wealthy English businessmen.

The name of Kowloon Tsai is preserved in the hill west of the former village of Kowloon Tsai. Martial artist Bruce Lee&#x27;s residence was located in Kowloon Tong during the 70s.

==Landmarks==
Notable landmarks in Kowloon Tong include:
* Beacon Hill — a hill with a height of 457 m, and several residential developments.
* Festival Walk — a large shopping centre operated by Swire Group and CITIC, now owned by Singaporean investment firm Mapletree.
* Broadcast Drive — a road where all of Hong Kong&#x27;s free-to-air TV stations (TVB, ATV), Hong Kong&#x27;s oldest radio station (Radio Television Hong Kong), and Commercial Radio Hong Kong are headquartered.
* St. Teresa&#x27;s Church
* 41 Cumberland Road, Bruce Lee&#x27;s former home in Hong Kong. Demolished in 2019.

==Media==
The two biggest radio companies in Hong Kong, Commercial Radio Hong Kong and Radio Television Hong Kong, are both located on Broadcast Drive, Kowloon Tong. Minibus route 29A serves Broadcast Drive from MTR Kowloon Tong station.

==Education==

The Hong Kong Baptist University and the City University of Hong Kong are located in Kowloon Tong. Many leading local English medium of instruction (EMI) primary and secondary schools on the Kowloon peninsula are located in the area, including Kowloon True Light Middle School, Kowloon Tong School (Secondary Section), Maryknoll Convent School, La Salle College and Beacon Hill School. Other well known international schools in the area include the American International School, Yew Chung International School, Concordia International School, Australian International School, and the Delia School of Canada.

Kowloon Tong is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 41. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and Kowloon Tong Government Primary School.

The stretch of Waterloo Road through Kowloon Tong forms part of Hong Kong&#x27;s Route 1. It leads into the Lion Rock Tunnel, and as such serves as an important artery for traffic heading into and out of the New Territories (in particular Sha Tin). Yau Ma Tei is also accessible via Waterloo Road.

<text>Daryl Robert Williams (born 21 August 1942) is a former Australian politician who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1993 to 2004, representing the Liberal Party. He was Attorney-General in the Howard government from 1996 to 2003.

==Background and early career==
Williams was born in East Fremantle, Western Australia, and was educated at Richmond School, East Fremantle, and Perth Modern School. He went on to the University of Western Australia and Wadham College, Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar in 1965.

In 1968, Williams started work as a barrister. In 1971, he became counsel for the Asian Development Bank. However, four years later, he returned to practising law on his own. He was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1982, and became a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989. Williams continued to practise law until his election to Parliament in 1993.

==Political career==
Williams was briefly a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry in 1994, serving as Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader of the Opposition on Constitutional Reform.

In 1996, when the Liberals won office, he was appointed Attorney-General first as a member of the outer ministry and then as a member of Cabinet from October 1997. He served in this capacity until 2003, serving the longest continuous term in the position since H. V. Evatt (1941–49). Williams was also Minister for Justice for a period in 1996–97. He attended the 1998 Constitutional Convention as a parliamentary delegate.

After the Liberal ministerial shakeup of 2003, Williams was appointed Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In April 2004, he announced he would not be contesting the 2004 election. He stood down from the ministry in July 2004.

==Post-political career==
Williams was seriously considered as a candidate to replace Justice Mary Gaudron as a judge of the High Court of Australia in 2003, and was the nominee of the Western Australian Law Society for the post. Dyson Heydon was eventually appointed to the post. Williams was also considered a possible candidate for appointment to the High Court prior to the retirement of Justice Michael McHugh in 2005, following his retirement from politics. Susan Crennan was eventually appointed as McHugh&#x27;s replacement. In addition, Williams has been mooted as a contender for appointment as Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, a Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of Western Australia, or the Court of Appeal of Western Australia.

<doc id="559288" wikidata="Q3246226" url="?curid=559288" title="Oocyte">
<text>An oocyte (, oöcyte, or ovocyte is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is produced in a female fetus in the ovary during female gametogenesis. The female germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC), which then undergoes mitosis, forming oogonia. During oogenesis, the oogonia become primary oocytes. An oocyte is a form of genetic material that can be collected for cryoconservation.

==Formation==
The formation of an oocyte is called oocytogenesis, which is a part of oogenesis. Oogenesis results in the formation of both primary oocytes during fetal period, and of secondary oocytes after it as part of ovulation.

==Characteristics==

===Cytoplasm===
Oocytes are rich in cytoplasm, which contains yolk granules to nourish the cell early in development.

===Nucleus===
During the primary oocyte stage of oogenesis, the nucleus is called a germinal vesicle.

The only normal human type of secondary oocyte has the 23rd (sex) chromosome as 23,X (female-determining), whereas sperm can have 23,X (female-determining) or 23,Y (male-determining).

===Nest===
The space within an ovum or immature ovum is located is the cell-nest.

===Cumulus-oocyte complex===
The cumulus-oocyte complex contains layers of tightly packed cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte in the Graafian follicle. The oocyte is arrested in Meiosis II at the stage of metaphase II at the diplotene stage and is considered a secondary oocyte. Before ovulation, the cumulus complex goes through a structural change known as cumulus expansion. The granulosa cells transform from tightly compacted to an expanded mucoid matrix. Many studies show that cumulus expansion is critical for the maturation of the oocyte because the cumulus complex is the oocyte&#x27;s direct communication with the developing follicle environment. It also plays a significant role in fertilization, though the mechanisms are not entirely known and are species specific.

==Maternal contributions==
In order for an oocyte to become fertilized and ultimately grow into a fully functioning organism, it must be able to regulate multiple cellular and developmental processes. The oocyte, a large and complex cell, must be able to direct the growth of the embryo and control cellular activities. As the oocyte is a product of female gametogenesis, the maternal contribution to the oocyte and consequently the newly fertilized egg, is enormous. There are many types of molecules that are maternally supplied to the oocyte, which will direct various activities within the growing zygote.

===Avoidance of damage to germ-line DNA===

The DNA of a cell is vulnerable to the damaging effect of oxidative free radicals produced as byproducts of cellular metabolism. DNA damage occurring in oocytes, if not repaired, can be lethal and result in reduced fecundity and loss of potential progeny. Oocytes are substantially larger than the average somatic cell, and thus considerable metabolic activity is necessary for their provisioning. If this metabolic activity were carried out by the oocyte&#x27;s metabolic machinery, the oocyte genome would be exposed to the reactive oxidative by-products generated. Thus it appears that a process evolved to avoid this vulnerability of germline DNA. It was proposed that, in order to avoid damage to the DNA genome of the oocytes, the metabolism contributing to the synthesis of much of the oocyte&#x27;s constituents was shifted to other maternal cells that then transferred these constituents to oocytes. Thus, oocytes of many organisms are protected from oxidative DNA damage while storing up a large mass of substances to nurture the zygote in its initial embryonic growth.

===mRNAs and proteins===
During the growth of the oocyte, a variety of maternally transcribed messenger RNAs, or mRNAs, are supplied by maternal cells. These mRNAs can be stored in mRNP (message ribonucleoprotein) complexes and be translated at specific time points, they can be localized within a specific region of the cytoplasm, or they can be homogeneously dispersed within the cytoplasm of the entire oocyte. Maternally loaded proteins can also be localized or ubiquitous throughout the cytoplasm. The translated products of the mRNAs and the loaded proteins have multiple functions; from regulation of cellular &quot;house-keeping&quot; such as cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism, to regulation of developmental processes such as fertilization, activation of zygotic transcription, and formation of body axes. Below are some examples of maternally inherited mRNAs and proteins found in the oocytes of the African clawed frog.

===Mitochondria===
The oocyte receives mitochondria from maternal cells, which will go on to control embryonic metabolism and apoptotic events. The partitioning of mitochondria is carried out by a system of microtubules that will localize mitochondria throughout the oocyte. In certain organisms, such as mammals, paternal mitochondria brought to the oocyte by the spermatozoon are degraded through the attachment of ubiquitinated proteins. The destruction of paternal mitochondria ensures the strictly maternal inheritance of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

===Nucleolus===
In mammals, the nucleolus of the oocyte is derived solely from maternal cells. The nucleolus, a structure found within the nucleus, is the location where rRNA is transcribed and assembled into ribosomes. While the nucleolus is dense and inactive in a mature oocyte, it is required for proper development of the embryo.

===Ribosomes===
Maternal cells also synthesize and contribute a store of ribosomes that are required for the translation of proteins before the zygotic genome is activated. In mammalian oocytes, maternally derived ribosomes and some mRNAs are stored in a structure called cytoplasmic lattices. These cytoplasmic lattices, a network of fibrils, protein, and RNAs, have been observed to increase in density as the number of ribosomes decrease within a growing oocyte and mutation in them have been linked to infertility.

==Prophase I arrest==
Female mammals and birds are born possessing all the oocytes needed for future ovulations, and these oocytes are arrested at the prophase I stage of meiosis. In humans, as an example, oocytes are formed between three and four months of gestation within the fetus and are therefore present at birth. During this prophase I arrested stage (dictyate), which may last for many years, four copies of the genome are present in the oocytes. The arrest of ooctyes at the four genome copy stage appears to provide the informational redundancy needed to repair damage in the DNA of the germline. The repair process used likely involves homologous recombinational repair. Prophase arrested oocytes have a high capability for efficient repair of DNA damages. In particular, DNA double-strand breaks can be repaired during the period of prophase arrest by homologous recombinational repair and by non-homologous end joining. DNA repair capability appears to be a key quality control mechanism in the female germ line and a critical determinant of fertility.

==Paternal contributions==
The spermatozoon that fertilizes an oocyte will contribute its pronucleus, the other half of the zygotic genome. In some species, the spermatozoon will also contribute a centriole, which will help make up the zygotic centrosome required for the first division. However, in some species, such as in the mouse, the entire centrosome is acquired maternally. Currently under investigation is the possibility of other cytoplasmic contributions made to the embryo by the spermatozoon.

During fertilization, the sperm provides three essential parts to the oocyte: (1) a signalling or activating factor, which causes the metabolically dormant oocyte to activate; (2) the haploid paternal genome; (3) the centrosome, which is responsible for maintaining the microtubule system. See anatomy of sperm

==Abnormalities==
* Nondisjunction—a failure of proper homolog separation in meiosis I, or sister chromatid separation in meiosis II can lead to aneuploidy, in which the oocyte has the wrong number of chromosomes, for example 22,X or 24,X. This is the cause of conditions like Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome in humans. It is more likely with advanced maternal age.
* Some oocytes have multiple nuclei, although it is thought they never mature.

<text>Truddi Chase (June 13, 1935 – March 10, 2010) was an American author. She is best known for the book &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot; (1987), an autobiography about her experiences after being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder.

==Life==
According to her own account, Chase was born on a homestead near Honeoye Falls, New York, and grew up in an apartment in the same town. In her autobiography and in numerous interviews, Chase said that she was repeatedly and violently sexually and physically abused by her stepfather and beaten and neglected by her mother during her childhood and teenage years. By her report, she had always remembered that molestation and abuse occurred from the age of two onwards but that she could not focus on details before going into therapy. According to her autobiography, Truddi Chase was not her actual birth name. At age 16, she ran away from her abusive household and changed her name to Truddi Chase to avoid being tracked down by her parents. In an interview with The Chicago Tribune, Truddi Chase described how her other personalities remained &quot;dormant&quot; until stressors in her midlife caused extreme anxiety, eventually unravelling all of her parts. In 1979, Truddi Chase had her first experience with her other identities. She described interactions between her many personality characters as well as interactions between her identities and physical body. It was during sessions with hypnotherapist, Robert Phillips, that she found that she had 92 identities.

Chase chose not to integrate her identities into one integrated whole, and instead chose to welcome her parts into a cooperating team. In her book, she describes giving talks to convicted child molesters to explain her abuse history and to warn them of the psychological devastation that child abuse inflicts upon its victims.

In 1987, Chase published her autobiography, &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot;, which was written from the perspective of her many identities. It begins with an introduction from her therapist, and then presents Chase&#x27;s experience with her 92 personalities. 

When promoting the book during a March 21, 1990, appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, Chase discussed her life with host Oprah Winfrey, including her 92 distinct personalities. Her account of her life moved Winfrey to tears. The host told Chase, &quot;I had gone all the way into the path of truth for myself and also could relate to hers that much more readily, which is what happens when you open yourself up.&quot; Chase also stated that a &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter had tracked down her family, including her stepfather, who denied abusing Chase, but that other members of Chase&#x27;s family confirmed her story.

In 1990, the book was adapted into a two-part ABC miniseries, titled &quot;Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase,&quot; which cast Shelley Long in the title role.

Truddi Chase died on March 10, 2010, at her home in Laurel, Maryland, at the age of 74.

==In media==
Writer Grant Morrison was inspired by Chase&#x27;s first memoir when they co-created the DC Comics superhero Crazy Jane, which first appeared in the volume 2 of the &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; comic book series in 1989.

<text>The Suicide Squad is an antihero/supervillain team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first version of the Suicide Squad debuted in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #25 (September 1959) and the second and modern version, created by John Ostrander, debuted in &quot;Legends&quot; #3 (January 1987).

Various incarnations of the Suicide Squad have existed throughout the years as depicted in several self-titled comic book series, from its origins in the Silver Age to its modern-day post-&quot;Crisis&quot; re-imagining, to the New 52 version and the current version that was introduced during DC Rebirth in 2016. Though the roster has changed considerably over the years, some of its best-known members of the Squad include Rick Flag, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Bronze Tiger, and Harley Quinn.
==Background and creation==
The original Suicide Squad appeared in six issues of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. Co-creator/writer Robert Kanigher took the name from another comic series of the same name, by an unknown writer, from the Australian comic publishing company Frew Publications. Although this early incarnation of the team (created by Kanigher and artist Ross Andru) did not have the antics of later iterations, it explained much of squad&#x27;s field leader Rick Flag&#x27;s personal history. The team&#x27;s administrator Amanda Waller was introduced in the &quot;Legends&quot; miniseries, with the original Silver Age Squad&#x27;s backstory elaborated in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #14.

The Suicide Squad was later re-established in the &quot;Legends&quot; miniseries with writer John Ostrander at the helm. The renewed concept involved the government employing a group of supervillains to perform extremely dangerous missions as deniable and expendable assets, a concept popular enough for an ongoing self-titled series. The squad was often paired with DC&#x27;s other government agency, Checkmate, culminating in the Janus Directive crossover.

While the Squad is often depicted as succeeding on their missions, failure was an occurrence. Ostrander remarked on how stories sometimes purposefully brought in characters to be killed off. The team&#x27;s very name, Suicide Squad, relates to the idea that this group of characters is sent on dangerous and difficult suicide missions.

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 1) lasted 66 issues, along with one &quot;Annual&quot; and one special (&quot;Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad Special&quot; #1). After the series&#x27; cancellation in 1992, the team members made several appearances in titles such as &quot;Superboy&quot;, &quot;Hawk &amp; Dove&quot;, &quot;Chase&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;.

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 2) was published in 2001, written by Keith Giffen, with art by Paco Medina. Though the series&#x27; first issue featured a Squad composed entirely of Giffen&#x27;s Injustice League members, the roster was promptly slaughtered, save for Major Disaster and Multi-Man. These developments prompt Sgt. Rock, who was written into the role of squad leader, to recruit new members of whom many die during missions.

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 3) (initially subtitled &quot;Raise the Flag&quot; in DC&#x27;s solicitations) was an eight-issue miniseries published in 2007. It featured the return of writer John Ostrander with art by Javier Pina. The story focused on the return of Rick Flag Jr. and the formation of a new squad to attack a corporation responsible for developing a deadly bio-weapon.

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 4) debuted as part of DC Comics&#x27; line-wide New 52 continuity reboot in 2011. The relaunched book was written by Adam Glass, with art by Federico Dallocchio and Ransom Getty. Amanda Waller directs the group from behind the scenes; Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and King Shark feature prominently in this version of the Squad. The volume concluded in 2014, with issue #30.

&quot;New Suicide Squad&quot; was launched in July 2014. Written by Sean Ryan with art by Jeremy Roberts, the new series continues to feature Deadshot and Harley Quinn, with Deathstroke, Black Manta, and the Joker&#x27;s Daughter also featuring.

==Publication history==
===Silver Age===
====Plot synopsis====
=====&quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;=====

The original Suicide Squad first appears in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #25. Team members appearing in the debut issue include physicist Jess Bright; astronomer Dr. Hugh Evans; Rick Flag Jr., the team leader; and Karin Grace (Davies in #26, Grace in #37), flight medic. The characters have follow-up appearances in issues #26, #27 and #37-#39. The team&#x27;s introductory story depicts them being called in to deal with a super-heated red-hued object, called the &quot;Red Wave&quot;, which was heading toward a seaside resort and boiling the ocean along the way. They travel in a plane equipped with a testing and analysis lab. Follow-up appearances show the team dealing with a variety of challenges: a meteor storm (the radiation from which causes them to shrink), a giant serpent in the Paris subway tunnels, a giant monster that captures Karin, and a nuclear bomb. Issues #38 and #39 show the team encountering dinosaurs and meeting the leader of the Cyclops.

=====&quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot;=====

The Suicide Squad then continued in &quot;The War that Time Forgot&quot;, published in &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; #110-111, #116-121, #125, and #127-128, that introduced the characters Morgan and Mace.

=====&quot;Legends&quot;=====

In the midst of Darkseid&#x27;s attempt to turn humanity against Earth&#x27;s superheroes via his minion Glorious Godfrey, Amanda Waller assigns Rick Flag Jr. leadership of a reformed Task Force X. Blockbuster, Bronze Tiger, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and Enchantress make up Task Force X at Belle Reve. The squad&#x27;s first mission is to eliminate Darkseid&#x27;s rampaging fire elemental Brimstone; Blockbuster dies during the conflict and Deadshot takes down the creature with an experimental laser rifle. Waller dismisses the group, though they soon reconvened to rescue Captain Boomerang after Godfrey captures him.

====&quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2)====

During World War II, a number of Army riffraff are assembled into a unit that is highly expendable, and therefore nicknamed the Suicide Squadron (shortened to Suicide Squad). Several such teams existed, but their history in comics is only scarcely recorded before Rick Flag, Sr. becomes the leader of the team (and even then, only a few adventures of this Squad are shown). After the war ends, the team (together with the Argent group) is put under the umbrella organization of Task Force X. After his father&#x27;s death, Rick Flag Jr. goes on to lead the group that is featured in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. A deadly encounter with a Yeti during a mission in Cambodia ends with Evans and Bright dead and sends Flag back to the U.S. with a wounded Karin Grace. After a stint with the Forgotten Heroes, Flag is drafted into the Squad that Waller assembles in &quot;Legends&quot;.

&quot;A Princess&#x27; Story&quot; from &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #28 sheds light on Nightshade&#x27;s origin, revealing that her mother hailed from the Land of the Nightshades. An ill-fated trip to this world ends with Nightshade&#x27;s mother dead and her brother abducted, and Nightshade spends the following years honing her shadowy powers and building a reputation as a crimefighter. She falls in with King Faraday at the C.B.I.; Faraday eventually introduces her to Amanda Waller, who agrees to help her rescue her brother in exchange for Nightshade&#x27;s participation in the Squad.

====Other World War II Suicide Squads====
The World War II Squad of &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #14 was a means of tying the Silver Age Suicide Squad to the war-era Suicide Squad (also called the Suicide Squadron) created by Robert Kanigher for his &quot;The War that Time Forgot&quot; tales in the pages of &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot;. This Suicide Squadron is described as a &quot;top-secret Ranger outfit&quot; whose members were trained to tackle missions from which ordinary volunteers were not expected to return alive. It is unclear whether this team is part of the modern Suicide Squad canon or if the Squad introduced in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; was intended as a replacement for them in DC continuity.

Another classic version of the Squad (Rick Flag Jr., Karin Grace, Jess Bright, and Dr. Hugh Evans) appears in &quot;&quot;. The group is briefly shown undertaking the sorts of dangerous missions the Squad is known for, and Flag eventually drafts Hal Jordan onto the team to assist in preparing a space flight to Mars. The experimental rocket&#x27;s test runs quickly goes south and the group (sans Jordan) dies in the explosion.

In the &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot; continuity, the World War II-era Suicide Squad is led by Francine Charles and consists of Killer Croc, Enchantress, Rose Wilson, and Barbara Gordon (who in this setting is a vampire). In the final issue of the comic, it is revealed that after the end of the war, this Suicide Squad became a &quot;Dark Justice League&quot; defending the world against magical threats.

===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 1)===
====Background====
The first volume of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, written by modern Squad creator John Ostrander, launched in May 1987, shortly after the team was introduced in the &quot;Legends&quot; crossover storyline. It lasted for 66 monthly issues, along with one annual and one special (&quot;Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad Special&quot; #1), both published in 1988.

This series details the covert operations of the modern post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Squad, created (in-universe) and directed by Amanda Waller. It is notable for bringing obscure characters such as Captain Boomerang and Deadshot to prominence; the latter received his own tie-in miniseries in 1988, co-written by Ostrander and Kim Yale. The Suicide Squad also presents a modern context for field team leader Rick Flag Jr.&#x27;s modern-day activities and his involvement in the Silver-Age Suicide Squad. Former Batgirl Barbara Gordon makes her first appearance as the information-broker Oracle, and serves as the Squad&#x27;s remote radio support, a vocation she adopted after being shot by the Joker. She uses a wheelchair as a result of being shot.

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 1) takes pains to humanize its relatively obscure ensemble cast, partly via an in-house chaplain and psychiatric staff at the Squad&#x27;s Belle Reve headquarters. These staff members are frequently seen interviewing various Squad operatives or providing evaluations of their mental states; several full issues are dedicated to examining prominent characters&#x27; personal lives and motivations.

====Plot synopsis====
Throughout 66 issues, this incarnation of the Suicide Squad undertook numerous high-risk missions for the U.S. government.

=====&quot;Baptism of Fire&quot;=====
The team&#x27;s first mission in the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; title set them up against their recurring enemies, the Onslaught. They infiltrate their headquarters (the fortress known as Jotunheim, situated in Qurac) and proceed to defeat and kill most of the Onslaught members. Elements from this first story arc return over the series, such as the death of Mindboggler, Captain Boomerang&#x27;s cowardly and treacherous nature, Nightshade&#x27;s attraction to Rick Flag Jr., a rivalry between Rustam and Flag, and Ravan&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the Bronze Tiger.

=====&quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;=====
On orders of Derek Tolliver (the team&#x27;s liaison with the UNSC), the Suicide Squad is sent to Moscow in order to free the captive Zoya Trigorin, a revolutionary writer. Although the mission is largely successful in its first half, the team finds that Zoya does not want to be freed at all, causing friction among the team as they must plan their escape.

In the end, the mission ends with the Squad having to travel across a tundra to reach safety, but come face to face with the People&#x27;s Heroes, the Russian&#x27;s own group of metahumans. In the conflict, Trigorin dies, and Nemesis (Tom Tresser) is captured. It turns out Tolliver never even considered the possibility of Trigorin wishing to become a martyr, automatically leaping at the conclusion she would be eager to leave the Soviet Union, and thus risked Waller&#x27;s wrath upon the mission&#x27;s end.

Nemesis eventually escapes thanks to a collaboration between the Suicide Squad and the Justice League International, although the two teams fight one another first. This conflict is primarily the result of Batman&#x27;s investigation into the Suicide Squad, his confrontation with Waller, and his being forced to drop the investigation when she reveals that she can easily figure out his secret identity if need be.

=====&quot;Rogues&quot; and &quot;Final Round&quot;=====
In this story arc, building on subplots from previous issues, Rick Flag goes after Senator Cray in order to assassinate him. Previously, Senator Cray had been blackmailing Amanda Waller in order for her to ensure Cray&#x27;s reelection, threatening her with the exposure of the Suicide Squad to the public.

At first, there is also the threat of Waller being usurped by Derek Tolliver, the now-former liaison between the Squad and NSC, who conspires with Cray against Waller. Waller deals with the situation by engaging in counter-blackmail with help of Checkmate, but refrains from informing Flag. The Squad&#x27;s existence is in danger, and he decides to deal with the problem himself.

Manhunter quits the Squad upon learning of their upcoming mission against Loa in New Orleans, LA.

In order to stop him, the Squad is sent after Flag, and it is eventually Deadshot who confronts Flag shortly before he can shoot Cray, but too late to prevent Tolliver&#x27;s murder in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #21. As a result of these developments, the Suicide Squad is exposed to the public, contrary to Flag&#x27;s intentions. Flag flees the scene, while Deadshot is shot by the arriving police officers. Unfortunately for Deadshot, who has a death wish, he does not die from the injuries.

Resulting from the exposure, Amanda Waller is replaced by an actor named Jack Kale so that she can continue to run the Squad. The team then goes on a public relations offensive, becoming, for a time, a prominent heroic team by saving a renowned nun from a repressive regime. Rick Flag travels to Jotunheim, where the Onslaught is still headquartered, and finishes the mission his father could not, blowing up Jotunheim with a prototype nuclear Nazi weapon but gives up his life to do so.

=====&quot;The Janus Directive&quot;=====

&quot;The Janus Directive&quot; is a crossover storyline involving an interagency war between Checkmate, the Suicide Squad, and Project Atom, who are manipulated by Kobra in order to distract the United States intelligence community from his activities. During the crossover, the headquarters of Checkmate and the Suicide Squad are destroyed as the war between the agencies worsens, and the lives of all members of the Force of July are lost except for Major Victory. In the end, with the defeat of Kobra, the various government agencies are made autonomous, to be overseen by Sarge Steel.

=====&quot;Apokolips Now&quot;=====
In this issue, the character known as Duchess regains her memory after suffering from amnesia and recalls her true identity as Lashina, of the Female Furies. With help from Shade the Changing Man, Lashina kidnaps several members of the Squad and takes them to Apokolips to win back her place among the Furies. Along with Dr. Light, Squad support members Briscoe (helicopter pilot) and computer specialist/Waller aide Flo Crowley are killed in an attack by parademons. Prevented by Steel from going, Bronze Tiger recruits Deadshot and others and joins with the Forever People to journey to Apokolips. Darkseid arrives to destroy Lashina for bringing humans to his world and allows the rest of the Squad to return to Earth with their dead. Shade is returned to his home dimension as the Squad mourns Flo.

=====&quot;The Coils of the LOA&quot;=====
This issue details the plan of a group called LOA to raise a zombie army with drugs spread across the world. To ensure the Squad doesn&#x27;t interfere, they reveal how Waller is still in charge and the White House decide to wash their hands of her. With the Suicide Squad on the verge of being disbanded by her superiors, Waller gathers Ravan, Poison Ivy, and Deadshot in an assassination mission of the LOA. The deal for the villains is simple: the three will be set free after helping Waller kill the LOA. While the villains run after the assassination, Waller allows herself to be put into custody.

=====&quot;The Phoenix Gambit&quot;=====
The storyline running through &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 1) #40 - 43 reassembles a scattered Suicide Squad after a year of imprisonment for Amanda Waller. She receives a presidential pardon, courtesy of Sarge Steel, as well as money in the bank and her old privileges concerning the use of imprisoned villains.

This is done so that Waller can reassemble her Squad and prevent a confrontation between American and Soviet forces in the war-torn country of Vlatava. As the Suicide Squad succeeds and finishes their mission, they go in a new direction, free from the government as freelance operatives per the terms negotiated by Waller. Under the leadership of Waller, who now also goes into the field as an operative, they are a mercenary squad open to the highest bidder.

=====&quot;Serpent of Chaos&quot;=====
This storyline ran through &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #45 - 47. Amanda Waller and the Squad covertly sneak into Jerusalem seeking to capture or kill Kobra. However, the squad&#x27;s arrival is detected by the Hayoth, and their Mossad liaison Colonel Hacohen takes Waller and Vixen into custody in order to show them that the Hayoth has already captured Kobra. Amanda figures out that Kobra allowed the Hayoth to capture him but is unsure of why. Judith follows Vixen to a meeting with the Bronze Tiger and Ravan, critically wounds Vixen, and is nearly killed by the Bronze Tiger. Meanwhile, the Atom discovers Kobra&#x27;s true plan all along was to corrupt Dybbuk the Hayoth&#x27;s artificial intelligence team member. Kobra &quot;corrupted&quot; Dybbuk through a series of philosophical conversations about the nature of good and evil; he then attempts to use Dybbuk to start World War III. The day is saved by Ramban, the team&#x27;s kabbalistic magician, who has a lengthy conversation with Dybbuk about the true nature of good and evil, choice, and morality. Meanwhile, Ravan and Kobra have their final battle which results in Ravan&#x27;s supposed death via poisoning.

=====&quot;Mystery of the Atom&quot;=====
Batman is working to solve the murder of the Atom. He hears that Waller possibly knew about the explosion that killed him. Superman is told by a CBI agent that the Suicide Squad would be attempting to rescue Qurac&#x27;s former President Marlo. Adam Cray confronts Deadshot about killing his father, Senator Cray. Golem of the Hayoth enters the facility holding Marlo on Blood Island. The Hayoth mistakenly believe they would be allowed to take President Marlo into custody. This misunderstanding caused the Hayoth to become embroiled in a four-way conflict with the Justice League (Superman, Batman, and Aquaman), who were there searching for Ray Palmer (the Atom), as well as the Suicide Squad, and the Onslaught. After a series of skirmishes, Superman ends the free-for-all with a shockwave caused by clapping both his hands together. The League confronts Ray Palmer, and he tells them about Micro Force and their murder of Adam Cray, the man who had been impersonating him as a member of the Suicide Squad.

=====&quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;=====
The series concludes in issues #63 - 66, in which the Suicide Squad travels to Diabloverde to depose a seemingly invulnerable and invincible dictator calling himself Guedhe. This despot has his own personal bodyguards, a group of villains calling themselves the Suicide Squad. Insulted by the rival team usurping the Suicide Squad name, Waller accepts the mission to liberate Diabloverde at the price of one peso, paid by an exiled resident, Maria.

During that mission, they confront and defeat the other Suicide Squad. Each member of the Squad journeys through the mystical jungle towards Guedhe&#x27;s fortress, confronting their own inner demons along the way, except for Deadshot. Amanda Waller deceives the despot, who is actually Maria&#x27;s husband, into a form of self-destruction. The despot believes himself to be immortal, but in reality, he is a powerful psychic whose consciousness continues to animate his remains. Waller convinces him that her touch brings death, leading to his demise. Afterward, Waller disbands the Suicide Squad, and the series comes to an end.

===Interim stories (between Vol. 1–2)===
====Background====
Though John Ostrander&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 1) series was canceled in 1992 with issue #66, the concept lived on in various DC storylines throughout the years. What follows is a breakdown of the Squad&#x27;s various odd appearances over the years.

====Plot synopsis====
=====&quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 3): &quot;Watery Grave&quot;=====

The Squad resurfaces in a three-issue &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 3) arc, with a lineup consisting of Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, King Shark, Knockout, Sam Makoa, and Sidearm (who meets his death in the following issue). Superboy himself joins the Squad to assist in taking out a Pacific Rim crime cartel called the Silicon Dragons. Writer Karl Kesel claims to have considered killing Captain Boomerang during this arc.

=====&quot;Hawk &amp; Dove&quot; (vol. 4)=====

In the &quot;Hawk &amp; Dove&quot; (vol. 4) miniseries, superheroes Hawk and Dove (Sasha Martens and Wiley Wolverman) are targeted by the government who assemble a new Suicide Squad to subdue the pair. Squad members at the time include Bronze Tiger, Count Vertigo, Deadshot, Flex, Quartzite, Shrapnel, and Thermal.

=====&quot;Chase&quot; (vol. 1): &quot;Letdowns&quot;=====

Amanda Waller reforms the Squad once again in &quot;Chase&quot; #2. D.E.O. agent Cameron Chase joins Bolt, Copperhead, Killer Frost, and Sledge on a mission to take out a South American military base, only to be betrayed by the villains.

=====&quot;Superman: Our Worlds at War Secret Files &amp; Origins&quot;: &quot;Resources&quot;=====

The brief story &quot;Resources&quot; (one of several in the issue) depicts Amanda Waller assembling the Squad that is seen in the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; arc.

=====&quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; (vol. 1): &quot;The Doomsday Protocol&quot;=====

Lex Luthor organizes another Suicide Squad during his term as President of the United States so that they can recruit Doomsday to battle the alien Imperiex. This version of the Squad consists of Chemo, Mongul, Plasmus, and Shrapnel; it is led by Manchester Black, under the supervision of Steel. Doomsday seemingly kills most of the Squad upon his release, but all of the characters turn up alive in later comics.

===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 2)===
====Background====
Keith Giffen&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; run (which began in November 2001 and lasted 12 issues) is something of a darkly humorous analog to the writer&#x27;s former work on Justice League International, and follows a new version of the Squad, designated Task Force Omega, and run by Sgt. Frank Rock. Together with his right-hand man Bulldozer, Rock taps new characters Havana and Modern to round out the team&#x27;s mobile HQ. President Lex Luthor and Secretary of Metahuman Affairs Amanda Waller are shown to be supplying the Squad&#x27;s assignments.

Rock is thought by several other characters to have been deceased since the end of World War II, and they are surprised to see him alive and well. Two flashback stories provide some context for Rock&#x27;s current-day activities, but the series&#x27; final issue strongly implies that Rock is an (as-yet-unidentified) impostor.

====Plot synopsis====
The First issue details the former Injustice League&#x27;s terminally botched attempt to extract a kidnapped scientist from an Icelandic facility. With all but one team member (Major Disaster) presumed dead by issue&#x27;s end, Sgt. Rock forms a new Suicide Squad for the missions ahead. Major Disaster, Deadshot, and Killer Frost are mainstays of the field team. For his part, Rock is every bit as ruthless as Amanda Waller was (though far more affable), remorselessly sending his agents to die for the good of their country.

The Squad&#x27;s missions involve eliminating an out-of-control colony of bio-engineered army ants, and investigating the mysterious island of Kooey Kooey Kooey to discourage its inhabitants from declaring war on Earth. Havana is revealed to be Amanda Waller&#x27;s daughter, and the final story arc revolves around an all-out attack on the Squad by the members of Onslaught, led by the son of longtime Squad enemy Rustam. Onslaught kills Modem and captures Rock, Havana, and Waller.

Upon learning that the Squad has been compromised, Waller&#x27;s office drafts the Justice Society of America to counterattack Onslaught alongside the Squad, but they arrive too late to save Havana from Rustam&#x27;s wrath. Deadshot discovers a discarded Sgt. Rock mask inside an empty holding cell, which prompts Bulldozer (who is monitoring the situation remotely via Deadshot&#x27;s video camera) to stand from his wheelchair and announce &quot;Oh, boy!&quot; before leaving. Back in her office, Amanda Waller reviews Bulldozer&#x27;s file, and states that he and Sgt. Rock died in 1945.

===Interim stories (between Vol. 2–3)===
====Background====
Amanda Waller and the Suicide Squad were heavily involved in the events and fallout of &quot;52&quot;. During much of this time, Waller ran the Squad covertly because of her station as the White Queen of Checkmate. This inter-faction tension is a recurring theme throughout many Squad stories of this era.

====Plot synopsis====
=====&quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2): &quot;Dead Men&quot;=====

A Squad composed of Deadshot, Killer Frost, and Solomon Grundy goes after Lois Lane to silence her investigation into Lex Luthor&#x27;s presidency.

=====&quot;Superman Secret Files &amp; Origins 2004&quot;: &quot;Suicide Watch&quot;=====

A mystery agent sends Captain Boomerang, Double Down, Killer Frost, and Killer Shark to (unsuccessfully) assassinate an imprisoned Amanda Waller as she awaits trial. Nemesis also appears.

=====&quot;52&quot;=====

Amanda Waller assembles a short-lived Suicide Squad, led by Atom Smasher, to take on an out-of-control Black Adam. Atom Smasher&#x27;s team ambushes the Black Marvel Family, getting Waller the evidence that she needs to expose their threat to the world. As Waller reviews future potential Squad members, Atom Smasher quits the team, threatening to inform Checkmate of Waller&#x27;s unauthorized field ops unless she grants him a full pardon. Later, as World War III rages, Waller informs Bronze Tiger that Rick Flag Jr. is alive.

=====&quot;Checkmate&quot; (vol. 2): &quot;Rogue Squad&quot;=====

As part of DC&#x27;s &quot;One Year Later&quot; event, Greg Rucka penned the two-part &quot;Rogue Squad&quot; arc for &quot;Checkmate&quot; (vol. 2). After Bronze Tiger finds Rick Flag Jr. alive, Amanda Waller (now the White Queen of Checkmate) taps the pair to track down a rogue Squad that is out to expose her off-the-books activities. The Squad is led by Mirror Master, and includes Icicle, Javelin, Plastique, Tattooed Man, Punch, and Jewelee.

=====&quot;Salvation Run&quot;=====

Beginning in the pages of &quot;Countdown&quot;, the Squad makes various one-off appearances where they are seen rounding up the world&#x27;s villains for an unknown purpose. This culminates in the seven-issue &quot;Salvation Run&quot; miniseries (written by Bill Willingham), where the Squad sends the apprehended villains to a remote prison world via boom tube. Squad members seen rounding up villains include Rick Flag Jr., Bronze Tiger, Captain Boomerang, Count Vertigo, the General, King Faraday, Multiplex, Nightshade, Plastique, Bane, Chemo, and Deadshot (the latter three are betrayed by the Squad and sent to the prison planet with the other villains).
===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 3)===
====Background====
John Ostrander returned to the Suicide Squad for an eight-issue miniseries that began in November 2007. The series takes place between the squad&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Checkmate&quot; (vol. 2) #6–7 and the events of &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. It is functionally a sequel to the &quot;Checkmate&quot; arc, detailing how Rick Flag Jr. survived his apparent death before returning to Waller&#x27;s Suicide Squad.

DC Comics&#x27; official solicitations consistently referred to the miniseries as &quot;Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag&quot;, though this nomenclature is never used within any individual issue or collected edition of the miniseries.

====Plot synopsis====
After he is believed dead, Rick Flag Jr. resurfaces on the dinosaur-infested island of Skartaris alongside his enemy Rustam. The pair works together to survive. Unfortunately, Flag is forced to kill Rustam once they discover a way home. Afterward, he becomes a prisoner of war in Qurac for four years. Flag rejoins the Suicide Squad after he is rescued by Bronze Tiger.

After reviewing several new recruits, Amanda Waller briefs the Squad on the latest target: a Dubai-based global conglomerate called Haake-Bruton, whose new viral weapon is to be destroyed, and its board of directors eliminated. The Squad airdrops onto Haake-Bruton&#x27;s island stronghold, where Flag encounters Rustam&#x27;s revenge-seeking father. Eiling compromises the mission, conspiring with Thinker to betray the Squad to Haake-Bruton&#x27;s board in exchange for asylum. The Squad suffers heavy casualties in the sudden internal conflict. Despite numerous setbacks, Deadshot carries out the assassination, while Waller confronts the General personally. Eiling demonstrates control over Flag via psychological conditioning; Flag subdues him after revealing the cooperation as a ruse, and the Squad returns to Belle Reve. Flag is unfazed by Waller&#x27;s revelation that his own identity and memories are implanted, asserting to Nightshade that he is still Rick Flag Jr.

===Interim stories (between Vol. 3–4)===
====Background====
The Squad made prominent appearances in a four-issue &quot;Manhunter&quot; (vol. 4) arc and during the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover event. In his multiverse-spanning adventures, Booster Gold briefly cooperated with a version of the Silver Age Squad. These issues mark the Squad&#x27;s final appearances prior to DC Comics&#x27; New 52 continuity reboot in 2011.

====Plot synopsis====
=====&quot;Manhunter&quot; (vol. 4): &quot;Forgotten&quot;=====

The Suicide Squad has a run-in with Manhunter after she unknowingly compromises their months-long undercover investigation into the Crime Doctor&#x27;s metahuman genetic experiments in collaboration with Vestech Industries. Manhunter backs off of the trail at the insistence of the Squad and the Birds of Prey, but goes rogue in an effort to bring down the Crime Doctor, who futilely attempts to restrain the Squad after becoming aware of their deep-cover duplicity. The operation is dismantled, and Manhunter goes public with the takedown.

=====&quot;Booster Gold&quot; (vol. 2): &quot;1952 Pick-up&quot;=====

On one of his adventures throughout the DC multiverse, Booster Gold winds up in an alternate 1952, where Karin Grace drafts him into a Squad led by Frank Rock. The team infiltrates a U.S. military compound to root out a Soviet double-agent, who ultimately turns out to be the creator of the Rocket Reds&#x27; combat armor.

=====&quot;Blackest Night&quot;: &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;=====

In the three-issue &quot;Blackest Night&quot; tie-in arc &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (written by Gail Simone and John Ostrander), several deceased Suicide Squad members are reanimated as Black Lanterns (unofficially known as the &quot;Homicide Squad&quot;), led by Fiddler. They attack the Squad and the Secret Six, who are engaged in simultaneous conflicts at their respective headquarters, owing to Amanda Waller&#x27;s plans to shut down the Six. The two teams join forces to wipe out the Homicide Squad; with the immediate threat resolved, the Six assert their independence, and Deadshot places a bullet mere centimeters from Waller&#x27;s heart to punctuate the point. As she recovers at Belle Reve, she reveals that she is secretly Mockingbird, the Secret Six&#x27;s mysterious benefactor.

===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 4)===
====Background====
A new &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; title, written by Adam Glass with art by Federico Dallocchio and Ransom Getty, launched in September 2011 as part of The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe). Amanda Waller once again directs a crew of black ops agents on covert government missions, with Deadshot serving as the field team&#x27;s leader. The ongoing series is notable as serving as something of a showpiece for &quot;Batman&quot; villain Harley Quinn, and it has crossed over with other New 52 titles, including &quot;Resurrection Man&quot;, &quot;Grifter&quot;, and &quot;Justice League of America&#x27;s Vibe&quot;.

====Plot synopsis====
After a botched government mission forces her to execute an injured teammate, Amanda Waller sets out to assemble an expendable field team, prompting the formation of a new Suicide Squad. Waller forces dozens of Belle Reve&#x27;s death row inmates into a series of rigorous tests and torture scenarios to evaluate their loyalty and value as potential Squad members. The finalists—notably including Deadshot, King Shark, and Harley Quinn—are outfitted with micro-bomb implants, and inducted into the Squad.

The Suicide Squad&#x27;s missions typically involve the elimination or retrieval of high-value targets. At one point, the team must track down an AWOL Harley Quinn; in another mission, the Squad goes after Resurrection Man. The Basilisk terrorist group serves as a recurring villain (echoing the Onslaught organization from John Ostrander&#x27;s original &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; series), and several issues delve into the twisted relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker.

Eventually, Waller recruits serial killer James Gordon Jr. to act as Belle Reve&#x27;s in-house psychiatric adviser—but unbeknownst to her, Gordon quickly develops a twisted infatuation with her. One ongoing and unresolved plot point involves the Samsara serum—a medical treatment that Belle Reve&#x27;s doctors use to resurrect dead Squad members (including Deadshot and Voltaic). It is eventually discovered that the serum will permanently kill anyone to whom it is administered; Waller is implied to be one such subject.

=====Forever Evil=====
During the Forever Evil crossover event, the Crime Syndicate of America emerges as the new threat which the Suicide Squad must avert. After the destruction of Belle Reve and the release of its inmates, Waller recruits Deadshot to a new Suicide Squad team. He, in turn, recruits Harley Quinn. Amanda Waller later reveals to James Gordon Jr. that the current Suicide Squad is but one version of the Task Force; she calls out Task Force Y to assist in battling the Crime Syndicate.

===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 5)===
====Background====
Using the end of the &quot;New 52&quot; initiative as a launching point, DC Comics began a second relaunch of its entire line of titles called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; in 2016, written by Rob Williams and shifting between Jim Lee, John Romita, Jr., and Tony S. Daniel for art. &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 5) #1 (August 2016) was the debut bimonthly relaunch of the team&#x27;s comic book title which consisted of Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Katana and Enchantress. The Suicide Squad was given a new look, reflecting the team&#x27;s appearance in the DC Extended Universe. The title would crossover with &quot;Justice League&quot; in &quot;Justice League vs. Suicide Squad&quot;, written by Joshua Williamson and drawn by Jason Fabok, Tony S. Daniel, and Howard Porter.

====Plot synopsis====
=====The Black Vault=====
The Suicide Squad are sent to a Russian prison to retrieve a secret item, which turns out to be a portal to the Phantom Zone. During the unfolding events, a Russian group of metahumans, known as the Annihilation Brigade, shows up and the situation worsens. General Zod gets free of the Vault, and Captain Boomerang is killed. The battle is brought to an abrupt halt as a new character, Hack, breaches the Russian database and learns how to pull General Zod back into the portal.

=====Going Sane=====
Back in Belle Reve, scientists working for Waller are examining the portal. Waller shares her intent to weaponize Zod and add him to her Suicide Squad. Flag disagrees, and conflict escalates between the two, leading to Flag firing his gun at Waller.

In the next issue, Amanda&#x27;s scientists continue trying to extract Zod. Meanwhile, the portal is sending out electromagnetic waves, and the characters appear to act in increasingly erratic ways. The portal waves are shown as having the opposite effect on Harley, causing her to realise she must intervene in the escalating blood lust.

=====Justice League vs. Suicide Squad=====
This episode follows the Squad to the fictional island of Badhinisia, where the team has been dispatched to prevent the Brimstone Brotherhood from causing an earthquake. During the events, the Squad is confronted by the Justice League, having learned of the team&#x27;s existence from Batman. Waller shares her intention to blow the bombs in their necks if they are captured by, or surrender to, the League. The Suicide Squad are defeated by the Justice League until Killer Frost absorbs a portion of a weakened Superman&#x27;s life force and freezes everyone.

Back at Belle Reve Penitentiary, the Justice League has been captured by Amanda. Batman escapes his confinement and confronts Waller about her plans for the League. When the plot reveals the approaching threat of Max Lord and his super villain team, the two teams must pool their efforts in order to prevent the theft of a powerful weapon from inside Belle Reve.

As the story progresses, Lord succeeds in stealing the Heart of Darkness (a.k.a. the Eclipso Diamond) and uses it to control the League, and through them, gains control of the world. Batman rallies Lobo and the remaining Squad members to make a final stand against Lord, escalating to conflict with the compromised Justice League. Meanwhile, Amanda observes that Lord himself is falling under the influence of the Eclipso Diamond, and warns him of this when Lord has her brought to the White House. Lord realises too late that Waller&#x27;s warning held truth. In the following chaos, Batman deems them the new Justice League. Although Lord is able to bring most of the Squad/League under his control, he is defeated when Killer Frost, acting on Batman&#x27;s instructions, is able to create a prism of ice that reflects Superman&#x27;s heat vision in a frequency that will disrupt Eclipso&#x27;s control of the heroes, Eclipso himself being vanquished by Killer Frost as she draws on the life energy of the rest of the heroes and Squad members present, thus limiting the drain on any one of them. In the aftermath of the crisis, Killer Frost is officially released while Lord is kept in Waller&#x27;s custody, Waller musing that she will use him for &#x27;Task Force XI&#x27;.

=====Burning Down the House=====
=====Earthlings on Fire=====
=====Kill Your Darlings=====
=====Drain the Swamp=====
Waller recruits Juan Soria, a prospective hero who was turned down by the Justice League and then arrested for robbery, into the Squad in order to combat an alien force that feeds off optimism and hope. In preparation for the mission, Waller had systematically broken Soria down to rid him of any and all hope. This allowed him to defeat the creature. After learning that he was used, Waller relocates Soria to Killer Croc&#x27;s cell. Croc had previously been tempted to eat Soria and it is assumed this is what happened.

The Squad confronts Damage, who Waller wants to recruit for her Task Force XL. Meanwhile, King Faraday, who is still being held at Belle Reve, reveals he&#x27;s been accessing Waller&#x27;s hidden files and asks about someone named Coretta. Waller is visually shaken by the mention. She leaves the prison and goes to her daughter Coretta in the hospital as she&#x27;s just given birth to Waller&#x27;s grandchild. Her son Jessie tells her that Coretta does not want to see her. Hack returns and reveals she is in Belle Reve&#x27;s computers. She begins opening the cells, erasing files, and murdering guards.

===&quot;Suicide Squad Black&quot;===

Additionally, John Diggle and Lyla Michaels also work as part of the team, but are not implanted with explosives, and Harley Quinn makes a cameo appearance, but is not called for duty. Scheffer is killed by Waller as a result of him abandoning the mission while Diggle releases the remaining members from A.R.G.U.S.&#x27;s custody to help him stop Waller from bombing Starling City in an attempt to defeat Slade Wilson&#x27;s army. In the third season, Oliver Queen takes pity on Carrie Cutter / Cupid and hands her over to Waller for use in the squad. Additionally, former member Digger Harkness attempts to seek revenge on Michaels for attempting to terminate him for failing to complete a mission, only to be foiled by Queen and the Flash. In the episode &quot;Suicidal Tendencies&quot;, Diggle, Michaels, Lawton, and Cutter rescue Senator Joseph Cray from a hostage situation, during which Lawton sacrifices himself to save the others after discovering Cray had set up the attack to stage his own rescue and eventually mount a presidential campaign. After Shadowspire kills Waller, Michaels becomes A.R.G.U.S.&#x27;s new director and, as part of her efforts to reform the organization, temporarily disbands the squad to rework it into the &quot;Ghost Initiative&quot;. She then recruits Cutter, Chien Na Wei, Kane Wolfman, and Ricardo Diaz to locate and capture a terrorist financier named Dante without A.R.G.U.S.&#x27;s oversight. However, the operation fails after Diaz disables his explosive implant and warns Dante, who subsequently escapes. When the Joint Chiefs of Staff learn that the squad had been reactivated, Diggle resigns from A.R.G.U.S. to protect Michaels.
** At San Diego Comic-Con 2014, following the squad&#x27;s debut episode, Diggle&#x27;s actor David Ramsey revealed that there had been talk of a spin-off series focused on them. However, &quot;Arrow&quot; co-producer and comic book writer Keto Shimizu commented in January 2015 that it did not seem like a possibility due to David Ayer&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; film being in development at the time. Series producer Greg Berlanti later confirmed that the team&#x27;s inclusion within &quot;Arrow&quot; was used in order to test the audience&#x27;s reception and interest prior to Ayer&#x27;s film being put into production.

<text>Antônio Vilas-Boas (1934–1991) was a Brazilian farmer (later a lawyer) who claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials in 1957. Though similar stories had circulated for years beforehand, Vilas-Boas&#x27; claims were among the first alien abduction stories to receive wide attention. Some skeptics today consider the abduction story to be little more than a hoax, although Boas nonetheless reportedly stuck to his account throughout his life.

==Vilas-Boas&#x27; story==
At the time of his alleged abduction, Antônio Vilas-Boas was a 23-year-old Brazilian farmer who was working at night to avoid the hot temperatures of the day. On October 15, 1957, he was ploughing fields near São Francisco de Sales when he saw what he described as a &quot;red star&quot; in the night sky. According to his story, this &quot;star&quot; approached his position, growing in size until it became recognizable as a roughly circular or egg-shaped aerial craft, with a red light at its front and a rotating cupola on top. The craft began descending to land in the field, extending three &quot;legs&quot; as it did so. At that point, Boas decided to run from the scene.

According to Boas, he first attempted to leave the scene on his tractor, but when its lights and engine died after traveling only a short distance, he decided to continue on foot. However, he was seized by a humanoid, who was wearing grey coveralls and a helmet. Its eyes were small and blue, and instead of speech it made noises like barks or yelps. Three similar beings then joined the first in subduing Boas, and they dragged him inside their craft.

Once inside the craft, Boas said that he was stripped of his clothes and covered from head-to-toe with a strange gel. He was then led into a large semicircular room, through a doorway that had strange red symbols written over it. (Boas claimed that he was able to memorize these symbols and later reproduced them for investigators.) In this room the beings took samples of Boas&#x27; blood from his chin. After this he was then taken to a third room and left alone for around half an hour. During this time, some kind of gas was pumped into the room, which made Boas become violently ill.

Shortly after this, Boas claimed that he was joined in the room by another humanoid. This one, however, was female, very attractive, and naked. She was the same height as the other beings he had encountered, with a small, pointed chin and large, blue catlike eyes. The hair on her head was long and white (somewhat like platinum blonde) but her underarm and pubic hair were bright red. Boas said he was strongly attracted to the woman, and the two had sexual intercourse. During this act, Boas noted that the female did not kiss him but instead nipped him on the chin.

When it was all over, the female smiled at Boas, rubbing her belly and gestured upwards. Boas took this to mean that she was going to raise their child in space. The female seemed relieved that their &quot;task&quot; was over, and Boas himself said that he felt angered by the situation, because he felt as though he had been little more than &quot;a good stallion&quot; for the humanoids.

Boas said that he was then given back his clothing and taken on a tour of the ship by the humanoids. During this tour he said that he attempted to take a clock-like device as proof of his encounter, but was caught by the humanoids and prevented from doing so. He was then escorted off the ship and watched as it took off, glowing brightly. When Boas returned home, he discovered that four hours had passed.

He later became a lawyer, married and had four children. He stuck to the story of his alleged abduction for his entire life. Though some sources say he died in 1992, he died on January 17, 1991.

==Investigation==
Following this alleged event, Boas claimed to have suffered from nausea and weakness, as well as headaches and lesions on the skin which appeared without any kind of light bruising. Eventually, he contacted journalist José Martins, who had placed an ad in a newspaper looking for people who had had experiences with UFOs. Upon hearing Boas&#x27; story, Martins contacted Olavo Fontes of the National School of Medicine of Brazil; Fontes was also in contact with the American UFO research group APRO. Fontes examined the farmer and concluded that he had been exposed to a large dose of radiation from some source and was now suffering from mild radiation sickness. Writer Terry Melanson states:

:Among [Boas&#x27;s] symptoms were &#x27;pains throughout the body, nausea, headaches, loss of appetite, ceaselessly burning sensations in the eyes, cutaneous lesions at the slightest of light bruising...which went on appearing for months, looking like small reddish nodules, harder than the skin around them and , painful when touched, each with a small central orifice yielding a yellowish thin waterish discharge.&#x27; The skin surrounding the wounds presented &#x27;a hyperchromatic violet-tinged area.&#x27;

According to Researcher Peter Rogerson, the story first came to light in February, 1958, and the earliest definite print reference to Boas&#x27; story was from the April–June 1962 issue of the Brazilian UFO periodical &quot;SBESDV Bulletin&quot;. Rogerson notes that the story had definitely circulated between 1958 and 1962, and was probably recorded in print, but that details are uncertain.

Boas was able to recall every detail of his purported experience without the need for hypnotic regression. Further, Boas&#x27; experience occurred in 1957, which was still several years before the famous Hill abduction which made the concept of alien abduction famous and opened the door to many other reports of similar experiences.

Researcher Peter Rogerson, however, doubts the veracity of Boas&#x27; story. He notes that several months before Boas first related his claims, a similar story was printed in the November 1957 issue of the periodical &quot;O Cruzeiro&quot;, and suggests that Boas borrowed details of this earlier account, along with elements of the contactee stories of George Adamski. Rogerson also argues:

:One reason why the [Boas] story gained credibility was the prejudiced assumption that any farmer in the Brazilian interior had to be an illiterate peasant who &#x27;couldn&#x27;t make this up&#x27;. As Eddie Bullard pointed out to me, the fact that the Vilas-Boas family possessed a tractor put them well above the peasant class ... We now know that AVB was a determinedly upwardly mobile young man, studying a correspondence course and eventually becoming a lawyer (at which news the ufologists who had considered him too much the rural simpleton to have made the story up now argued that he was too respectable and bourgeois to have done so).

<doc id="559297" wikidata="Q37178" url="?curid=559297" title="Proto-Indo-European language">
<text>Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is the reconstructed common ancestor of the Indo-European language family. No direct record of Proto-Indo-European exists; its proposed features have been derived by linguistic reconstruction from documented Indo-European languages.

Far more work has gone into reconstructing PIE than any other proto-language, and it is the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. The majority of linguistic work during the 19th century was devoted to the reconstruction of PIE and its daughter languages, and many of the modern techniques of linguistic reconstruction (such as the comparative method) were developed as a result.

PIE is hypothesized to have been spoken as a single language from approximately 4500 BCE to 2500 BCE during the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, though estimates vary by more than a thousand years. According to the prevailing Kurgan hypothesis, the original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have been in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of eastern Europe. The linguistic reconstruction of PIE has provided insight into the pastoral culture and patriarchal religion of its speakers.

As speakers of Proto-Indo-European became isolated from each other through the Indo-European migrations, the regional dialects of Proto-Indo-European spoken by the various groups diverged, as each dialect underwent shifts in pronunciation (the Indo-European sound laws), morphology, and vocabulary. Over many centuries, these dialects transformed into the known ancient Indo-European languages. From there, further linguistic divergence led to the evolution of their current descendants, the modern Indo-European languages.

PIE is believed to have had an elaborate system of morphology that included inflectional suffixes (analogous to English &quot;child, child&#x27;s, children, children&#x27;s&quot;) as well as ablaut (vowel alterations, as preserved in English &quot;sing, sang, sung, song&quot;) and accent. PIE nominals and pronouns had a complex system of declension, and verbs similarly had a complex system of conjugation. The PIE phonology, particles, numerals, and copula are also well-reconstructed.

Asterisks are used by linguists as a conventional mark of reconstructed words, such as *, *, or *; these forms are the reconstructed ancestors of the modern English words &quot;water&quot;, &quot;hound&quot;, and &quot;three&quot;, respectively.

==Development of the hypothesis==
No direct evidence of PIE exists; scholars have reconstructed PIE from its present-day descendants using the comparative method. For example, compare the pairs of words in Italian and English: and &quot;foot&quot;, and &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;fish&quot;. Since there is a consistent correspondence of the initial consonants (&quot;p&quot; and &quot;f&quot;) that emerges far too frequently to be coincidental, one can infer that these languages stem from a common parent language. Detailed analysis suggests a system of sound laws to describe the phonetic and phonological changes from the hypothetical ancestral words to the modern ones. These laws have become so detailed and reliable as to support the Neogrammarian hypothesis: the Indo-European sound laws apply without exception.

William Jones, an Anglo-Welsh philologist and puisne judge in Bengal, caused an academic sensation when in 1786 he postulated the common ancestry of Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, the Celtic languages, and Old Persian, but he was not the first to state such a hypothesis. In the 16th century, European visitors to the Indian subcontinent became aware of similarities between Indo-Iranian languages and European languages, and as early as 1653, Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn had published a proposal for a proto-language (&quot;Scythian&quot;) for the following language families: Germanic, Romance, Greek, Baltic, Slavic, Celtic, and Iranian. In a memoir sent to the in 1767, , a French Jesuit who spent most of his life in India, had specifically demonstrated the analogy between Sanskrit and European languages. According to current academic consensus, Jones&#x27;s famous work of 1786 was less accurate than his predecessors&#x27;, as he erroneously included Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese in the Indo-European languages, while omitting Hindi.

In 1818, Danish linguist Rasmus Christian Rask elaborated the set of correspondences in his prize essay (&#x27;Investigation of the Origin of the Old Norse or Icelandic Language&#x27;), where he argued that Old Norse was related to the Germanic languages, and had even suggested a relation to the Baltic, Slavic, Greek, Latin and Romance languages. In 1816, Franz Bopp published &quot;On the System of Conjugation in Sanskrit&quot;, in which he investigated the common origin of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. In 1833, he began publishing the &quot;Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavic, Gothic, and German&quot;.

In 1822, Jacob Grimm formulated what became known as Grimm&#x27;s law as a general rule in his . Grimm showed correlations between the Germanic and other Indo-European languages and demonstrated that sound change systematically transforms all words of a language. From the 1870s, the Neogrammarians proposed that sound laws have no exceptions, as illustrated by Verner&#x27;s law, published in 1876, which resolved apparent exceptions to Grimm&#x27;s law by exploring the role of accent (stress) in language change.

August Schleicher&#x27;s &quot;A Compendium of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European, Sanskrit, Greek and Latin Languages&quot; (1874–77) represented an early attempt to reconstruct the Proto-Indo-European language.

By the early 1900s, Indo-Europeanists had developed well-defined descriptions of PIE which scholars still accept today. Later, the discovery of the Anatolian and Tocharian languages added to the corpus of descendant languages. A subtle new principle won wide acceptance: the laryngeal theory, which explained irregularities in the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European phonology as the effects of hypothetical sounds which no longer exist in all languages documented prior to the excavation of cuneiform tablets in Anatolian. This theory was first proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1879 on the basis of internal reconstruction only, and progressively won general acceptance after Jerzy Kuryłowicz&#x27;s discovery of consonantal reflexes of these reconstructed sounds in Hittite.

Julius Pokorny&#x27;s (&#x27;Indo-European Etymological Dictionary&#x27;, 1959) gave a detailed, though conservative, overview of the lexical knowledge accumulated by 1959. Jerzy Kuryłowicz&#x27;s 1956 &quot;Apophonie&quot; gave a better understanding of Indo-European ablaut. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became robust enough to establish its relationship to PIE.

In &quot;The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World&quot;, Mallory and Adams illustrate the resemblance with the following examples of cognate forms (with the addition of Old English for further comparison):
==Historical and geographical setting==
Scholars have proposed multiple hypotheses about when, where, and by whom PIE was spoken. The Kurgan hypothesis, first put forward in 1956 by Marija Gimbutas, has become the most popular. It proposes that the original speakers of PIE were the Yamnaya culture associated with the kurgans (burial mounds) on the Pontic–Caspian steppe north of the Black Sea. According to the theory, they were nomadic pastoralists who domesticated the horse, which allowed them to migrate across Europe and Asia in wagons and chariots. By the early 3rd millennium BCE, they had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into eastern Europe.

Other theories include the Anatolian hypothesis, which posits that PIE spread out from Anatolia with agriculture beginning 7500–6000 BCE, the Armenian hypothesis, the Paleolithic continuity paradigm, and the indigenous Aryans theory. The last two of these theories are not regarded as credible within academia. Out of all the theories for a PIE homeland, the Kurgan and Anatolian hypotheses are the ones most widely accepted, and also the ones most debated against each other. Following the publication of several studies on ancient DNA in 2015, Colin Renfrew, the original author and proponent of the Anatolian hypothesis, has accepted the reality of migrations of populations speaking one or several Indo-European languages from the Pontic steppe towards Northwestern Europe.

==Descendants==

The antiquity of the earliest attestation (in units of 500 years) of each Indo-European group is: 2000–1500 BCE for Anatolian; 1500–1000 BCE for Indo-Aryan and Greek; 1000–500 BCE for Iranian, Celtic, Italic, Phrygian, Illyrian, Messapic, South Picene, and Venetic; 500–1 BCE for Thracian and Ancient Macedonian; 1–500 CE for Germanic, Armenian, Lusitanian, and Tocharian; 500–1000 CE for Slavic; 1500–2000 CE for Albanian and Baltic.

The table lists the main Indo-European language families, comprising the languages descended from Proto-Indo-European.
Commonly proposed subgroups of Indo-European languages include Italo-Celtic, Graeco-Aryan, Graeco-Armenian, Graeco-Phrygian, Daco-Thracian, and Thraco-Illyrian.

There are numerous lexical similarities between the Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Kartvelian languages due to early language contact, as well as some morphological similarities—notably the Indo-European ablaut, which is remarkably similar to the root ablaut system reconstructible for Proto-Kartvelian.

===Marginally attested languages===
The Lusitanian language was a marginally attested language spoken in areas near the border between present-day Portugal and Spain.

The Venetic and Liburnian languages known from the North Adriatic region are sometimes classified as Italic.

Albanian and Greek are the only surviving Indo-European descendants of a Paleo-Balkan language area, named for their occurrence in or in the vicinity of the Balkan peninsula. Most of the other languages of this area—including Illyrian, Thracian, and Dacian—do not appear to be members of any other subfamilies of PIE, but are so poorly attested that proper classification of them is not possible. Forming an exception, Phrygian is sufficiently well-attested to allow proposals of a particularly close affiliation with Greek, and a Graeco-Phrygian branch of Indo-European is becoming increasingly accepted.

==Phonology==
Proto-Indo-European phonology has been reconstructed in some detail. Notable features of the most widely accepted (but not uncontroversial) reconstruction include:
*three series of stop consonants reconstructed as voiceless, voiced, and breathy voiced;
*sonorant consonants that could be used syllabically;
*three so-called laryngeal consonants, whose exact pronunciation is not well-established but which are believed to have existed in part based on their detectable effects on adjacent sounds;
*the fricative 
*a vowel system in which and were the most frequently occurring vowels. The existence of as a separate phoneme is debated.

===Notation===

====Vowels====
The vowels in commonly used notation are:

====Consonants====

The corresponding consonants in commonly used notation are:

All sonorants (i.e. nasals, liquids and semivowels) can appear in syllabic position. The syllabic allophones of *y and *w are realized as the surface vowels *i and *u respectively.

===Accent===
The Proto-Indo-European accent is reconstructed today as having had variable lexical stress, which could appear on any syllable and whose position often varied among different members of a paradigm (e.g. between singular and plural of a verbal paradigm). Stressed syllables received a higher pitch; therefore it is often said that PIE had a pitch accent. The location of the stress is associated with ablaut variations, especially between full-grade vowels ( and ) and zero-grade (i.e. lack of a vowel), but not entirely predictable from it.

The accent is best preserved in Vedic Sanskrit and (in the case of nouns) Ancient Greek, and indirectly attested in a number of phenomena in other IE languages, such as Verner&#x27;s Law in the Germanic branch. Sources for Indo-European accentuation are also the Balto-Slavic accentual system and &quot;plene&quot; spelling in Hittite cuneiform. To account for mismatches between the accent of Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, as well as a few other phenomena, a few historical linguists prefer to reconstruct PIE as a tone language where each morpheme had an inherent tone; the sequence of tones in a word then evolved, according to that hypothesis, into the placement of lexical stress in different ways in different IE branches.

==Morphology==
Proto-Indo-European, like its earliest attested descendants, was a highly inflected, fusional language. Suffixation and ablaut were the main methods of marking inflection, both for nominals and verbs. The subject of a sentence was in the nominative case and agreed in number and person with the verb, which was additionally marked for voice, tense, aspect, and mood.

===Root===

Proto-Indo-European nominals and verbs were primarily composed of roots – affix-lacking morphemes that carried the core lexical meaning of a word. They were used to derive related words (cf. the English root &quot;-&quot;friend&quot;-&quot;, from which are derived related words such as &quot;friendship,&quot; &quot;friendly&quot;, &quot;befriend&quot;, and newly coined words such as &quot;unfriend&quot;). As a rule, roots were monosyllabic, and had the structure (s)(C)CVC(C), where the symbols C stand for consonants, V stands for a variable vowel, and optional components are in parentheses. All roots ended in a consonant and, although less certain, they appear to have started with a consonant as well.

A root plus a suffix formed a word stem, and a word stem plus an inflectional ending formed a word. Proto-Indo-European was a fusional language, in which inflectional morphemes signaled the grammatical relationships between words. This dependence on inflectional morphemes means that roots in PIE, unlike those in English, were rarely used without affixes.

===Ablaut===

Many morphemes in Proto-Indo-European had short &quot;e&quot; as their inherent vowel; the Indo-European ablaut is the change of this short &quot;e&quot; to short &quot;o&quot;, long &quot;e&quot; (ē), long &quot;o&quot; (&quot;ō&quot;), or no vowel. The forms are referred to as the &quot;ablaut grades&quot; of the morpheme—the &quot;e&quot;-grade, &quot;o&quot;-grade, zero-grade (no vowel), etc. This variation in vowels occurred both within inflectional morphology (e.g., different grammatical forms of a noun or verb may have different vowels) and derivational morphology (e.g., a verb and an associated abstract verbal noun may have different vowels).

Categories that PIE distinguished through ablaut were often also identifiable by contrasting endings, but the loss of these endings in some later Indo-European languages has led them to use ablaut alone to identify grammatical categories, as in the Modern English words &quot;sing&quot;, &quot;sang&quot;, &quot;sung&quot;.

===Noun===
Proto-Indo-European nouns were probably declined for eight or nine cases:
*nominative: marks the subject of a verb. Words that follow a linking verb (copulative verb) and restate the subject of that verb also use the nominative case. The nominative is the dictionary form of the noun.
*accusative: used for the direct object of a transitive verb.
*genitive: marks a noun as modifying another noun.
*dative: used to indicate the indirect object of a transitive verb, such as &quot;Jacob&quot; in &quot;Maria gave Jacob a drink&quot;.
*instrumental: marks the &quot;instrument&quot; or means by, or with, which the subject achieves or accomplishes an action. It may be either a physical object or an abstract concept.
*ablative: used to express motion away from something.
*locative: expresses location, corresponding vaguely to the English prepositions &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, and &quot;by&quot;.
*vocative: used for a word that identifies an addressee. A vocative expression is one of direct address where the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence. For example, in the sentence, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, John&quot;, &quot;John&quot; is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed.
*allative: used as a type of locative case that expresses movement towards something. It was preserved in Anatolian (particularly Old Hittite), and fossilized traces of it have been found in Greek. It is also present in Tocharian. Its PIE shape is uncertain, with candidates including &quot;*-h2(e)&quot;, &quot;*-(e)h2&quot;, or &quot;*-a&quot;.
Late Proto-Indo-European had three grammatical genders:
* masculine
* feminine
* neuter
This system is probably derived from an older two-gender system, attested in Anatolian languages: common (or animate) and neuter (or inanimate) gender. The feminine gender only arose in the later period of the language. Neuter nouns collapsed the nominative, vocative and accusative into a single form, the plural of which used a special collective suffix (manifested in most descendants as &quot;-a&quot;). This same collective suffix in extended forms and (respectively on thematic and athematic nouns, becoming &quot;-ā&quot; and &quot;-ī&quot; in the early daughter languages) became used to form feminine nouns from masculines.

All nominals distinguished three numbers:
* singular
* dual
* plural
These numbers were also distinguished in verbs (see below), requiring agreement with their subject nominal.

===Pronoun===
Proto-Indo-European pronouns are difficult to reconstruct, owing to their variety in later languages. PIE had personal pronouns in the first and second grammatical person, but not the third person, where demonstrative pronouns were used instead. The personal pronouns had their own unique forms and endings, and some had two distinct stems; this is most obvious in the first person singular where the two stems are still preserved in English &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. There were also two varieties for the accusative, genitive and dative cases, a stressed and an enclitic form.

===Verb===
Proto-Indo-European verbs, like the nouns, exhibited an ablaut system.

The most basic categorisation for the reconstructed Indo-European verb is grammatical aspect. Verbs are classed as:
*stative: verbs that depict a state of being
*imperfective: verbs depicting ongoing, habitual or repeated action
*perfective: verbs depicting a completed action or actions viewed as an entire process.
Verbs have at least four grammatical moods:
*indicative: indicates that something is a statement of fact; in other words, to express what the speaker considers to be a known state of affairs, as in declarative sentences.
*imperative: forms commands or requests, including the giving of prohibition or permission, or any other kind of advice or exhortation.
*subjunctive: used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred
*optative: indicates a wish or hope. It is similar to the cohortative mood and is closely related to the subjunctive mood.
Verbs had two grammatical voices:
* active: used in a clause whose subject expresses the main verb&#x27;s agent.
*mediopassive: for the middle voice and the passive voice.
Verbs had three grammatical persons: first, second and third.

Verbs had three grammatical numbers:
*singular
*dual: referring to precisely two of the entities (objects or persons) identified by the noun or pronoun.
*plural: a number other than singular or dual.

Verbs were probably marked by a highly developed system of participles, one for each combination of tense and voice, and an assorted array of verbal nouns and adjectival formations.

The following table shows a possible reconstruction of the PIE verb endings from Sihler, which largely represents the current consensus among Indo-Europeanists.
===Numbers===
Proto-Indo-European numerals are generally reconstructed as follows:

Rather than specifically 100, * may originally have meant &quot;a large number&quot;.

===Particle===
Proto-Indo-European particles were probably used both as adverbs and as postpositions. These postpositions became prepositions in most daughter languages.

Reconstructed particles include for example, * &quot;under, below&quot;; the negators *, *; the conjunctions * &quot;and&quot;, * &quot;or&quot; and others; and an interjection, *, expressing woe or agony.

===Derivational morphology===
Proto-Indo-European employed various means of deriving words from other words, or directly from verb roots.

====Internal derivation====
Internal derivation was a process that derived new words through changes in accent and ablaut alone. It was not as productive as external (affixing) derivation, but is firmly established by the evidence of various later languages.

=====Possessive adjectives=====
Possessive or associated adjectives were probably created from nouns through internal derivation. Such words could be used directly as adjectives, or they could be turned back into a noun without any change in morphology, indicating someone or something characterised by the adjective. They were probably also used as the second elements in compounds. If the first element was a noun, this created an adjective that resembled a present participle in meaning, e.g. &quot;having much rice&quot; or &quot;cutting trees&quot;. When turned back into nouns, such compounds were Bahuvrihis or semantically resembled agent nouns.

In thematic stems, creating a possessive adjective seems to have involved shifting the accent one syllable to the right, for example:
* &quot;*tómh₁-o-s&quot; &quot;slice&quot; (Greek &quot;tómos&quot;) &gt; &quot;*tomh₁-ó-s&quot; &quot;cutting&quot; (i.e. &quot;making slices&quot;; Greek &quot;tomós&quot;) &gt; &quot;*dr-u-tomh₁-ó-s&quot; &quot;cutting trees&quot; (Greek &quot;drutómos&quot; &quot;woodcutter&quot; with irregular accent).
* &quot;*wólh₁-o-s&quot; &quot;wish&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;vára-&quot;) &gt; &quot;*wolh₁-ó-s&quot; &quot;having wishes&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;vará-&quot; &quot;suitor&quot;).

In athematic stems, there was a change in the accent/ablaut class. The reconstructed four classes followed an ordering in which a derivation would shift the class one to the right:
: acrostatic → proterokinetic → hysterokinetic → amphikinetic
The reason for this particular ordering of the classes in derivation is not known. Some examples:
* Acrostatic &quot;*krót-u-s&quot; ~ &quot;*krét-u-s&quot; &quot;strength&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;krátu-&quot;) &gt; proterokinetic &quot;*krét-u-s&quot; ~ &quot;*kr̥t-éw-s&quot; &quot;having strength, strong&quot; (Greek &quot;kratús&quot;).
* Hysterokinetic &quot;*ph₂-tḗr&quot; ~ &quot;*ph₂-tr-és&quot; &quot;father&quot; (Greek &quot;patḗr&quot;) &gt; amphikinetic &quot;*h₁su-péh₂-tōr&quot; ~ &quot;*h₁su-ph₂-tr-és&quot; &quot;having a good father&quot; (Greek &quot;εὑπάτωρ&quot;, eupátōr).

=====Vrddhi=====
A vrddhi derivation, named after the Sanskrit grammatical term, signifying &quot;of, belonging to, descended from&quot;. It was characterised by &quot;upgrading&quot; the root grade, from zero to full (&quot;e&quot;) or from full to lengthened (&quot;ē&quot;). When upgrading from zero to full grade, the vowel could sometimes be inserted in the &quot;wrong&quot; place, creating a different stem from the original full grade.

Examples:
* full grade &quot;*swéḱuro-s&quot; &quot;father-in-law&quot; (Vedic Sanskrit ) &gt; lengthened grade *&quot;swēḱuró-s&quot; &quot;relating to one&#x27;s father-in-law&quot; (Vedic , Old High German &quot;swāgur&quot; &quot;brother-in-law&quot;).
* full grade &quot;*dyḗw-s&quot; &gt; zero grade &quot;*diw-és&quot; &quot;sky&quot; &gt; new full grade &quot;*deyw-o-s&quot; &quot;god, sky god&quot; (Vedic , Latin &quot;deus&quot;, etc.). Note the difference in vowel placement, &quot;*dyew-&quot; in the full-grade stem of the original noun, but in the vrddhi derivative.

=====Nominalization=====
Adjectives with accent on the thematic vowel could be turned into nouns by moving the accent back onto the root. A zero grade root could remain so, or be &quot;upgraded&quot; to full grade like in a vrddhi derivative. Some examples:
* PIE &quot;*ǵn̥h₁-tó-s&quot; &quot;born&quot; (Vedic &quot;jātá-&quot;) &gt; &quot;*ǵénh₁-to-&quot; &quot;thing that is born&quot; (German &quot;Kind&quot;).
* Greek &quot;leukós&quot; &quot;white&quot; &gt; &quot;leũkos&quot; &quot;a kind of fish&quot;, literally &quot;white one&quot;.
* Vedic &quot;kṛṣṇá-&quot; &quot;dark&quot; &gt; &quot;kṛ́ṣṇa-&quot; &quot;dark one&quot;, also &quot;antelope&quot;.

This kind of derivation is likely related to the possessive adjectives, and can be seen as essentially the reverse of it.

====Affixal derivation====
==Syntax==
The syntax of the older Indo-European languages has been studied in earnest since at least the late nineteenth century, by such scholars as Hermann Hirt and Berthold Delbrück. In the second half of the twentieth century, interest in the topic increased and led to reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European syntax.

Since all the early attested IE languages were inflectional, PIE is thought to have relied primarily on morphological markers, rather than word order, to signal syntactic relationships within sentences. Still, a default (unmarked) word order is thought to have existed in PIE. In 1892, Jacob Wackernagel reconstructed PIE&#x27;s word order as subject–verb–object (SVO), based on evidence in Vedic Sanskrit.

Winfred P. Lehmann (1974), on the other hand, reconstructs PIE as a subject–object–verb (SOV) language. He posits that the presence of person marking in PIE verbs motivated a shift from OV to VO order in later dialects. Many of the descendant languages have VO order: modern Greek, Romance and Albanian prefer SVO, Insular Celtic has VSO as the default order, and even the Anatolian languages show some signs of this word order shift. Tocharian and Indo-Iranian, meanwhile, retained the conservative OV order. Lehmann attributes the context-dependent order preferences in Baltic, Slavic and Germanic to outside influences. Donald Ringe (2006), however, attributes these to internal developments instead.

Paul Friedrich (1975) disagrees with Lehmann&#x27;s analysis. He reconstructs PIE with the following syntax:
* basic SVO word order
* adjectives before nouns
* head nouns before genitives
* prepositions rather than postpositions
* no dominant order in comparative constructions
* main clauses before relative clauses
Friedrich notes that even among those Indo-European languages with basic OV word order, none of them are &quot;rigidly&quot; OV. He also notes that these non-rigid OV languages mainly occur in parts of the IE area that overlap with OV languages from other families (such as Uralic and Dravidian), whereas VO is predominant in the central parts of the IE area. For these reasons, among others, he argues for a VO common ancestor.

Hans Henrich Hock (2015) reports that the SVO hypothesis still has some adherents, but the &quot;broad consensus&quot; among PIE scholars is that PIE would have been an SOV language. The SOV default word order with other orders used to express emphasis (e.g., verb–subject–object to emphasise the verb) is attested in Old Indo-Aryan, Old Iranian, Old Latin and Hittite, while traces of it can be found in the enclitic personal pronouns of the Tocharian languages.

<text>Tower Comics was an American comic book publishing company that operated from 1965 to 1969, best known for Wally Wood&#x27;s &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;, a strange combination of secret agents and superheroes; and Samm Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Tippy Teen&quot;, an Archie Andrews clone. The comics were published by Harry Shorten and edited by Schwartz and Wood. Tower Comics was part of Tower Publications, a paperback publisher at that point best known for their Midwood Books line of soft-core erotic fiction aimed at male readers.

Tower Comics set themselves apart by publishing 25-cent, 64-page comics, during a time of 12-cent, 32-page comics. The comics were something of a throw-back to the Golden Age, in that they had more pages than most of their contemporaries and usually featured five or six independent stories, with all the main characters coming together for the final story of the issue, a common Golden Age plotting device used in team books such as DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;.

== History ==
Tower publisher Harry Shorten &quot;cut a dream deal with Wally Wood&quot; in which Shorten would be the managing editor and &quot;Wood would be granted a wide latitude of creative and business freedom devoid of a 9-to-5 office job or hefty administrative duties, and be allowed to concentrate on creating characters and concepts for an expanding line of superhero comics&quot;.

When it became obvious Wood could not handle the volume of material Shorten wanted to publish, he hired Samm Schwartz, who Shorten knew from both men&#x27;s many years at Archie Comics. Schwartz handled the scheduling of all the material and assignments of scripts and art other than Wood&#x27;s own. Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Tippy Teen&quot;, an &quot;Archie&quot;-style comic about the adventures of a spunky teenaged girl, ran 27 issues. &quot;Tippy Teen&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Go-Go and Animal&quot;, featured many stories drawn by Schwartz, as well as contributions from moonlighting Archie artists like Harry Lucey and Dan DeCarlo. 

Other notable creators associated with Tower included Dan Adkins, Gil Kane, Reed Crandall, Steve Ditko, Richard Bassford, Len Brown, Steve Skeates, Larry Ivie, Bill Pearson, Russ Jones, Roger Brand, and Tim Battersby-Brent.

== Legacy ==
At some point in the early 1980s John Carbonaro purchased the rights to the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents and associated characters and published them in his JC Comics line. In 1984, Deluxe Comics launched their own line of new T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents stories, claiming the characters had fallen into the public domain. Carbonaro sued, and was eventually awarded full legal rights to the property.

In the early 2000s DC began to reprint the original Tower stories as part of their &quot;DC Archive Editions&quot;, and in 2010 DC began publishing a new &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; series, having announced the year before that they had secured the lawful right to do so.

<text>Ritualization refers to the process by which a sequence of non-communicating actions or an event is invested with cultural, social or religious significance. This definition emphasizes the transformation of everyday actions into rituals that carry deeper meaning within a cultural or religious context. Rituals are symbolic, repetitive, and often prescribed activities that hold religious or cultural significance for a certain group of people. They serve various purposes: promoting social solidarity by expressing shared values, facilitating the transmission of cultural knowledge and regulating emotions.

==History of ritualization==
The concept of ritualization was first described by Edmund Selous in 1901 and later named by Julian Huxley in 1914 as ritualization (Dissanayake 2006; Lorenz 1966). 

It has been studied in various fields, including animal behavior, anthropology, psychology, sociology and even cognitive sciences. 

In the field of animal behavior, ritualization refers to the evolutionary process by which non-communicative behaviors are transformed into communicative behaviors. Niko Tinbergen expanded the concept of ritualization in his 1951 paper &quot;The Study of Instinct,&quot; in which he described how certain animal behaviors, such as courtship and aggression, become more effective forms of communication through a gradual process of selection and refinement.

In the social sciences, the study of ritualization can be dated back to the 19th century. Émile Durkheim argued that rituals serve as a means of reinforcing social solidarity(otherwise known as social cohesion) and promoting a shared sense of identity among members of a community. Max Weber focused on the role of ritual in religion and suggested that it played a crucial role in shaping beliefs and values.

In the 20th century, the study of ritual became increasingly interdisciplinary, with scholars from anthropology, psychology, and other fields exploring its various dimensions. Victor Turner emphasized the symbolic and cultural aspects of ritual, while Randall Collins explored its psychological and emotional dimensions.

In recent years, scholars have continued to study rituals from a variety of perspectives, including the cognitive, evolutionary, and neuroscientific. These studies have resolved the origins, functions, and effects of ritual behavior and opened up new ways for understanding its role in human society and culture.
==In non-human animals ==

Ritualization is a behavior that occurs typically in a member of a given species in a highly stereotyped fashion and independent of any direct physiological significance. It is found, in differing forms, both in non-human animals and in humans.

Konrad Lorenz, working with greylag geese and other animals such as water shrews, showed that ritualization was an important process in their development. He showed that the geese obsessively displayed a reflexive motor pattern of egg retrieval when stimulated by the sight of an egg outside their nest. Similarly, in the shrews, Lorenz showed that once they had become used to jumping over a stone in their path, they went on jumping at that place after the stone was taken away. This sort of behaviour is analogous to obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans. 

Oskar Heinroth in 1910 and Lorenz from 1935 onwards studied the triumph ceremony in geese; Lorenz described it as becoming a fixed ritual. It involves a rolling behaviour (of the head and neck) and cackling with the head stretched forward, and occurs only among geese that know each other, meaning within a family or between mates. The triumph ceremony appears in varied situations, such as when mates meet after having been separated, when disturbed, or after an attack. The behaviour is now known also in other species, such as Canada goose.

==In humans==

=== Functions of ritualization===
Previous studies mentioned several main functions of ritualization: 

====Social Solidarity====
Ritualization fosters social solidarity by bringing people together and strengthening social bonds. They create a sense of belonging, shared identity, and unity among participants, contributing to the overall stability of a society.

====Cultural Transmission====
Ritualization facilitates the transmission of cultural knowledge, values, and traditions across generations. They help preserve cultural heritage and maintain continuity with the past. By participating in rituals, individuals learn about their culture, internalize its norms, and pass it on to future generations.

====Emotional Expression and Regulation====
Rituals provide a structured way for individuals to express and regulate their emotions. They offer a context for processing complex emotions, such as grief, joy, or gratitude, and can help people cope with significant life events, transitions, or loss.

=== Connecting the function to previous literature ===
====Émile Durkheim&#x27;s social solidarity theory====

In Durkheim&#x27;s famous writing “The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912)”, he theorized the distinction between traditional and modern societies in terms of social solidarity. He stated social solidarity is the ensemble of beliefs, which acts as the glue that holds society together. Traditional societies and modern societies differ fundamentally in terms of their structure and function and this is where the significance of ritualization becomes apparent.

Traditional societies are bound by mechanical solidarity, characterized by a collective conscience. This collective conscience is a shared mindset among all members of the society, forming a moral community. The core of this type of society is a sacred collective ideal that embodies the group&#x27;s virtues and serves as a source of identity. Consequently, individuals in these societies are united by shared values, norms, and beliefs, which are reinforced through ritualization. In traditional societies, there is a belief in a single, correct way of living, and any deviations are deemed sinful.

Ritualization is crucial for maintaining mechanical solidarity. Rituals allow group members to experience the power of the group over the self. Additionally, ritualization in the form of punishment for deviance serves as a potent method for curbing deviant behavior in traditional societies. By enforcing moral boundaries, ritual punishment helps to preserve social cohesion and unity within the group.

Later, his supporters, Victor Turner and Randall Collins expanded the theory of ritualization in different directions through their own research papers.

Turner expands on Durkheim&#x27;s ideas by focusing on the roles rituals play in social structure and transition. He emphasizes the importance of “communitas,” a state of social unity and cohesion that emerges during rituals or other shared experiences, transcending the ordinary divisions and hierarchies within society. On this basis, individuals participating in rituals temporarily set aside their social roles and come together as equals.

In Collins’ paper, he builds upon Durkheim&#x27;s ideas and proposes that rituals generate emotional energy, which in turn fosters social solidarity. Through a series of “interaction ritual chains,” individuals feel connected to one another and experience a sense of belonging.

===Structural ritualization theory===

Ritualization is associated with the work of Catherine Bell. Bell, drawing on the Practice Theory of Pierre Bourdieu, has taken a less functional view of ritual with her elaboration of ritualization. 

===Recent studies===
More recently scholars interested in the cognitive science of religion such as Pascal Boyer, Pierre Liénard, and William W. McCorkle, Jr. have been involved in experimental, ethnographic, and archival research on how ritualized actions might inform the study of ritualization and ritual forms of action. Boyer, Liénard, and McCorkle argue that ritualized compulsions are in relation to an evolved cognitive architecture where social, cultural, and environmental selection pressures stimulate &quot;hazard-precaution&quot; systems such as predation, contagion, and disgust in human minds. McCorkle argued that these ritualized compulsions (especially in regard to dead bodies vis-à-vis, mortuary behavior) were turned into ritual scripts by professional guilds only several thousand years ago with advancement in technology such as the domestication of plants and animals, literacy, and writing.

==Future insights==
Ritualization is a crucial process that transforms ordinary actions, behaviors, and events into rituals imbued with cultural, social or religious significance. Understanding the concept of ritualization and its various functions provides valuable insights into human societies and cultural practices. Future research can take a closer look at the psychological and physiological responses involved in the process and their interactions, thereby broadening the scope of ritualization studies.
