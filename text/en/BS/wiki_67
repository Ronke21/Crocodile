<text>A transcriptional activator is a protein (transcription factor) that increases transcription of a gene or set of genes. Activators are considered to have &quot;positive&quot; control over gene expression, as they function to promote gene transcription and, in some cases, are required for the transcription of genes to occur. Most activators are DNA-binding proteins that bind to enhancers or promoter-proximal elements. The DNA site bound by the activator is referred to as an &quot;activator-binding site&quot;. The part of the activator that makes protein–protein interactions with the general transcription machinery is referred to as an &quot;activating region&quot; or &quot;activation domain&quot;.

Most activators function by binding sequence-specifically to a regulatory DNA site located near a promoter and making protein–protein interactions with the general transcription machinery (RNA polymerase and general transcription factors), thereby facilitating the binding of the general transcription machinery to the promoter. Other activators help promote gene transcription by triggering RNA polymerase to release from the promoter and proceed along the DNA. At times, RNA polymerase can pause shortly after leaving the promoter; activators also function to allow these &quot;stalled&quot; RNA polymerases to continue transcription.

The activity of activators can be regulated. Some activators have an allosteric site and can only function when a certain molecule binds to this site, essentially turning the activator on. Post-translational modifications to activators can also regulate activity, increasing or decreasing activity depending on the type of modification and activator being modified.

In some cells, usually eukaryotes, multiple activators can bind to the binding-site; these activators tend to bind cooperatively and interact synergistically.

== Structure ==
Activator proteins consist of two main domains: a DNA-binding domain that binds to a DNA sequence specific to the activator, and an activation domain that functions to increase gene transcription by interacting with other molecules. Activator DNA-binding domains come in a variety of conformations, including the helix-turn-helix, zinc finger, and leucine zipper among others. These DNA-binding domains are specific to a certain DNA sequence, allowing activators to turn on only certain genes. Activation domains also come in a variety of types that are categorized based on the domain&#x27;s amino acid sequence, including alanine-rich, glutamine-rich, and acidic domains. These domains are not as specific, and tend to interact with a variety of target molecules.

Activators can also have allosteric sites that are responsible for turning the activators themselves on and off.

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Activator binding to regulatory sequences ===
Within the grooves of the DNA double helix, functional groups of the base pairs are exposed. The sequence of the DNA thus creates a unique pattern of surface features, including areas of possible hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, as well as hydrophobic interactions. Activators also have unique sequences of amino acids with side chains that are able to interact with the functional groups in DNA. Thus, the pattern of amino acid side chains making up an activator protein will be complementary to the surface features of the specific DNA regulatory sequence it was designed to bind to. The complementary interactions between the amino acids of the activator protein and the functional groups of the DNA create an &quot;exact-fit&quot; specificity between the activator and its regulatory DNA sequence.

Most activators bind to the major grooves of the double helix, as these areas tend to be wider, but there are some that will bind to the minor grooves.

Activator-binding sites may be located very close to the promoter or numerous base pairs away. If the regulatory sequence is located far away, the DNA will loop over itself (DNA looping) in order for the bound activator to interact with the transcription machinery at the promoter site.

In prokaryotes, multiple genes can be transcribed together (operon), and are thus controlled under the same regulatory sequence. In eukaryotes, genes tend to be transcribed individually, and each gene is controlled by its own regulatory sequences. Regulatory sequences where activators bind are commonly found upstream from the promoter, but they can also be found downstream or even within introns in eukaryotes.

=== Functions to increase gene transcription ===
Binding of the activator to its regulatory sequence promotes gene transcription by enabling RNA polymerase activity. This is done through various mechanisms, such as recruiting transcription machinery to the promoter and triggering RNA polymerase to continue into elongation.

==== Recruitment ====
Activator-controlled genes require the binding of activators to regulatory sites in order to recruit the necessary transcription machinery to the promoter region.

Activator interactions with RNA polymerase are mostly direct in prokaryotes and indirect in eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, activators tend to make contact with the RNA polymerase directly in order to help bind it to the promoter. In eukaryotes, activators mostly interact with other proteins, and these proteins will then be the ones to interact with the RNA polymerase.

===== Prokaryotes =====
In prokaryotes, genes controlled by activators have promoters that are unable to strongly bind to RNA polymerase by themselves. Thus, activator proteins help to promote the binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter. This is done through various mechanisms. Activators may bend the DNA in order to better expose the promoter so the RNA polymerase can bind more effectively. Activators may make direct contact with the RNA polymerase and secure it to the promoter.

===== Eukaryotes =====
In eukaryotes, activators have a variety of different target molecules that they can recruit in order to promote gene transcription. They can recruit other transcription factors and cofactors that are needed in transcription initiation.

Activators can recruit molecules known as coactivators. These coactivator molecules can then perform functions necessary for beginning transcription in place of the activators themselves, such as chromatin modifications.

DNA is much more condensed in eukaryotes; thus, activators tend to recruit proteins that are able to restructure the chromatin so the promoter is more easily accessible by the transcription machinery. Some proteins will rearrange the layout of nucleosomes along the DNA in order to expose the promoter site (ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes). Other proteins affect the binding between histones and DNA via post-translational histone modifications, allowing the DNA tightly wrapped into nucleosomes to loosen.

All of these recruited molecules work together in order to ultimately recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter site.

==== Release of RNA polymerase ====
Activators can promote gene transcription by signaling the RNA polymerase to move beyond the promoter and proceed along the DNA, initiating the beginning of transcription. The RNA polymerase can sometimes pause shortly after beginning transcription, and activators are required to release RNA polymerase from this “stalled” state. Multiple mechanisms exist for releasing these &quot;stalled&quot; RNA polymerases. Activators may act simply as a signal to trigger the continued movement of the RNA polymerase. If the DNA is too condensed to allow RNA polymerase to continue transcription, activators may recruit proteins that can restructure the DNA so any blocks are removed. Activators may also promote the recruitment of elongation factors, which are necessary for the RNA polymerase to continue transcription.

=== Regulation of activators ===
There are different ways in which the activity of activators themselves can be regulated, in order to ensure that activators are stimulating gene transcription at appropriate times and levels. Activator activity can increase or decrease in response to environmental stimuli or other intracellular signals.

==== Activation of activator proteins ====
Activators often must be &quot;turned on&quot; before they can promote gene transcription. The activity of activators is controlled by the ability of the activator to bind to its regulatory site along the DNA. The DNA-binding domain of the activator has an active form and an inactive form, which are controlled by the binding of molecules known as allosteric effectors to the allosteric site of the activator.

Activators in their inactive form are not bound to any allosteric effectors. When inactive, the activator is unable to bind to its specific regulatory sequence in the DNA, and thus has no regulatory effect on the transcription of genes.

When an allosteric effector binds to the allosteric site of an activator, a conformational change in the DNA-binding domain occurs, which allows the protein to bind to the DNA and increase gene transcription.

==== Post-translational modifications ====
Some activators are able to undergo post-translational modifications that have an effect on their activity within a cell. Processes such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, among others, have been seen to regulate the activity of activators. Depending on the chemical group being added, as well as the nature of the activator itself, post-translational modifications can either increase or decrease the activity of an activator. For example, acetylation has been seen to increase the activity of some activators through mechanisms such as increasing DNA-binding affinity. On the other hand, ubiquitination decreases the activity of activators, as ubiquitin marks proteins for degradation after they have performed their respective functions.

=== Synergy ===
In prokaryotes, a lone activator protein is able to promote transcription. In eukaryotes, usually more than one activator assembles at the binding-site, forming a complex that acts to promote transcription. These activators bind cooperatively at the binding-site, meaning that the binding of one activator increases the affinity of the site to bind another activator (or in some cases another transcriptional regulator) thus making it easier for multiple activators to bind at the site. In these cases, the activators interact with each other synergistically, meaning that the rate of transcription that is achieved from multiple activators working together is much higher than the additive effects of the activators if they were working individually.

==Examples==

=== Regulation of maltose catabolism ===
The breakdown of maltose in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is controlled by gene activation. The genes that code for the enzymes responsible for maltose catabolism can only be transcribed in the presence of an activator.The activator that controls transcription of the maltose enzymes is &quot;off&quot; in the absence of maltose. In its inactive form, the activator is unable to bind to DNA and promote transcription of the maltose genes.

When maltose is present in the cell, it binds to the allosteric site of the activator protein, causing a conformational change in the DNA-binding domain of the activator. This conformational change &quot;turns on&quot; the activator by allowing it to bind to its specific regulatory DNA sequence. Binding of the activator to its regulatory site promotes RNA polymerase binding to the promoter and thus transcription, producing the enzymes that are needed to break down the maltose that has entered the cell.

=== Regulation of the &quot;lac&quot; operon ===
The catabolite activator protein (CAP), otherwise known as cAMP receptor protein (CRP), activates transcription at the &quot;lac&quot; operon of the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is produced during glucose starvation; this molecule acts as an allosteric effector that binds to CAP and causes a conformational change that allows CAP to bind to a DNA site located adjacent to the lac promoter. CAP then makes a direct protein–protein interaction with RNA polymerase that recruits RNA polymerase to the lac promoter.

<text>Christine Grahame (formerly Creech; born 9 September 1944) is a Scottish politician who served as a Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2016 to 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale constituency since 2011, having previously represented the South of Scotland region from 1999 to 2011.

Born in Staffordshire, England, and raised in Edinburgh, Scotland, she attended the University of Edinburgh and Moray House College of Education. After graduating, Grahame worked as an English teacher in secondary schools. In 1984, she graduated from the Edinburgh University again, but this time with a Bachelor of Laws degree. After gaining Diploma in Legal Practice she worked as a solicitor. Grahame was the SNP&#x27;s candidate for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale in the 1992 UK General election, but failed to win the seat. In 1999, she ran for equivalent constituency in the new Scottish Parliament. Although she was unsuccessful, she was elected as an additional member of the South of Scotland region.

Grahame ran for Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party in the 2004 leadership election, but was defeated by Nicola Sturgeon. In 2011, she was elected MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale. Following the 2016 election to the 5th Scottish Parliament, Grahame was elected Deputy Presiding Officer. She held the position alongside Linda Fabiani from 2016 until 2021. She has served on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body since May 2021.

==Early life and education==
Christine Grahame was born on 9 September 1944 in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, to a Scottish father and English mother. Her maternal grandfather was Welsh. Grahame was brought up in Edinburgh, attending Boroughmuir High School.

She attained a Scottish Master of Arts degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1965 and gained her Diploma of Education from Moray House College of Education in 1966. After graduating, Grahame worked as a secondary teacher of English in a number of schools in Fife and Dumfries and Galloway.

After a period as a housewife, she returned to Edinburgh University as a mature student where she earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1984 and a Diploma in Legal Practice in 1985, subsequently practising as a solicitor at a number of law firms until her election as an MSP in 1999.

==Political career==

Grahame joined the Scottish National Party in 1970. Using her married name, Christine Creech, she was the SNP candidate at the 1992 General Election for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. In the 1994 European Parliament election, she contested the South of Scotland constituency, again unsuccessfully. At the 1999 Scottish Parliament election she ran for the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale constituency.

=== Member of the Scottish Parliament ===
Although she finished second in the constituency vote, she was elected on the SNP&#x27;s South of Scotland regional list. She later divorced and reverted to her maiden name. She contested Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale at the 2003 and 2007 elections, coming within 1,000 votes of victory on both occasions and being subsequently elected on the regional South of Scotland list. From 2001 to 2003, she was Convener of the Justice Committee.

In 2004, Grahame ran as a candidate for deputy leadership of the SNP after deputy leader Roseanna Cunningham entered the contest to replace leader John Swinney. She was defeated by Nicola Sturgeon. After the election, she was reshuffled from chair of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Health committee to Shadow Minister for Social Justice, generally seen by media commentators as an upwards shift. In June 2005, she was elected Honorary President of the Federation of Student Nationalists. 

In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Grahame won the redrawn seat of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, defeating former Liberal Democrat finance spokesman Jeremy Purvis. Following her election, she was again selected as Convener of the Justice Committee for the session.

==== Deputy Presiding Officer ====
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Grahame held the seat, increasing her share of the vote to 45.1%. Following the 2016 election, she was elected as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, serving alongside Linda Fabiani MSP. Grahame was also re-elected as Convener of the Cross Party Group on Animal Welfare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she went into self isolation as someone over 70 years old and therefore at more risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. In April 2020, Scottish Labour&#x27;s Lewis Macdonald was elected as interim Deputy Presiding Officer in her absence.

==== Return to backbenches ====
In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election Grahame was re-elected as an MSP. She has served on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body since May 2021.

In September 2024, she announced she would stand down at the 2026 Scottish Parliament election.

==Causes==
Since entering the Scottish Parliament in 1999 Grahame has picked up a number of causes, notably;

Borders Railway

&quot;For more information see: Borders Railway&quot;

One of Grahame&#x27;s first actions as an MSP in 1999 was to set up a Cross Party Group to support the work of public petitions on the re-establishment of the Borders Railway which had been closed in 1969 during the controversial Beeching cuts. She continued to campaign for this for a number of years, with the line eventually opening between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in 2015.

Grahame has named her continued support of this as one of her biggest achievements and said on its opening &quot;As someone who has campaigned for the return of the Waverley Line since 1999, it was an absolute privilege to be have finally traveled the length of the journey by rail, and to appreciate our wonderful countryside from a new perspective. So far this project has been an overwhelming success... If my experience is anything to go by, this will undoubtedly bring many, many visitors to Midlothian and the Borders as well as encouraging people to stay and live in the area.&quot;

Great Tapestry of Scotland

In late 2015 Grahame became involved in a public dispute with Scottish Borders Council over the siting of the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the constituency. Councillors had approved a £6m purpose built visitor centre at Tweedbank Railway Station, however Grahame contested that the business case was flawed and persuaded Scottish Government ministers to investigate this further before releasing the funding required to create it. Grahame favoured siting the tapestry in a disused building in Galashiels arguing that that option had more potential to regenerate the area and encourage tourists to access transport links from Galashiels to the wider region.

In June 2016 one councillor resigned from the SNP over Grahame&#x27;s intervention, claiming it represented a &quot;lack of support&quot; for SNP councillors and that he had not voted for her in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.

However, Grahame&#x27;s position was eventually vindicated, with the council recommending Galashiels as the preferred site in December 2016 stating &quot;Galashiels offers the greatest potential to provide a world class attraction which will make a significant contribution to the Borders economy.&quot;

Lockerbie Bombing

Grahame has been outspoken in her view that the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing is unsafe and represents a miscarriage of justice. In May 2009, Grahame visited Megrahi, in Greenock jail. After her visit, she told the press: &quot;I found it quite upsetting. The man is obviously very ill and he is desperate to see his family – absolutely desperate to see his family – so, whatever it takes, that&#x27;s the priority. He did tell me things I can&#x27;t discuss with you. But I am absolutely more convinced than ever that there has been a miscarriage of justice.&quot; A month later, Grahame arranged a second meeting with the prisoner, Megrahi.

A few days after the dropping of Megrahi&#x27;s appeal against conviction and his release on compassionate grounds on 20 August 2009, Grahame wrote an op-ed article for &quot;The Independent&quot; saying she is convinced of his innocence: &quot;He is not a saint, of course – he had a history with Libyan intelligence – but his hands are clean over Lockerbie.&quot;

Grahame has lodged several questions and motions on this in the Scottish Parliament and continues to be involved with campaign groups on the matter.

Republicanism

Grahame is a supporter of the political organisation Republic, a campaign to replace the British Monarchy with an elected head of state. In July 2009, Grahame snubbed Elizabeth II by checking her e-mails rather than attending the royal speech at Holyrood to mark the tenth anniversary of Scottish devolution. The move drew some criticism from commentators and fellow MSPs, however on the BBC Radio &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; programme, Grahame stated: &quot;I&#x27;m earning and working for my constituents far more than if I sit hypocritically in the chamber watching a monarch for an institution I do not support.&quot;

==Personal life==
Grahame has two sons and is a grandmother. She has stated previously she has a harmless neurological tremor, which is hereditary and can cause visible shaking. In her free time, she enjoys traditional jazz and gardening.

<text>Club Universidad Nacional, A.C., nicknamed &quot;Pumas&quot;, simply known as Pumas UNAM, is a professional football club based in Mexico City, Mexico. The club competes in Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football. Founded in 1954 as Club Deportivo Universidad, and they play their home games at Estadio Olímpico Universitario, which seats over 72,000 spectators.

The club was founded as an amateur club of UNAM college students and later developed into a professional team. The Pumas are one of the most popular clubs in Mexico and considered to be one of the &quot;Cuatro Grandes&quot; of Mexican football, alongside Cruz Azul, Guadalajara, and Club América.

Domestically, Pumas UNAM has won 11 trophies: 7 Liga MX, 1 Copa MX, the Campeón de Campeones twice, as well as 1 Segunda División de México. In international club football, the club has won 3 CONCACAF Champions Cups and 1 Copa Interamericana. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Club América in the &quot;derbi capitalino&quot;.

Their chant is, “Goya! Goya! Cachun, Cachun, Rah! Rah” The team is also known for its youth development system, which has produced international players such as Hugo Sánchez, Manuel Negrete, Luis Flores, Miguel España, Claudio Suárez, Luis García, Alberto García Aspe, David Patiño, Jorge Campos, Braulio Luna, Gerardo Torrado,
Francisco Fonseca,
Efraín Juárez, Héctor Moreno, Pablo Barrera, Israel Castro, Eduardo Herrera and Jesús Gallardo.

==History==
The dean of the university, Luis Chico Goerne, made the first attempt to affiliate a representative of UNAM with the top football Mexican championship of the day, filing a petition to join the Liga Mayor de Fútbol Professional del Distrito Federal. The petition was rejected in favor of de Morelos. Therefore, Pumas played 13 years in Mexicos Liga De Ascenso.

By the 1940s, the dean Gustavo Baz Prada assigned the task to prepare the UNAM team to Rodolfo &quot;Butch&quot; Muñoz, then player of Club España. The new manager formed its new team with members of the student body of the many schools and faculties of the university. The UNAM team joined many university tournaments, with successful results, and &quot;Butch&quot; Muñoz went on to manage the team for 13 years. This prepared the team to complete its later transition to professional status.

===Establishment: 1950s===
In August 1954, the Club Universidad was accepted as a member of the Segunda División, in those days the second tier division of professional football in Mexico. This achievement was accomplished with the support of the dean Nabor Carrillo and Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez Sr., a benefactor of the club. Aguilar Alvarez was appointed by the dean as the chairman of the club.

On September 12, 1954 UNAM played its first professional game, an away match against Monterrey. After competing for three years, Club Universidad requested a one-year moratorium in its competing in Segunda División play to undergo a programme rebuilding process. Within that year, Hector Ortiz was appointed as the new manager of the club, and a Board of Patrons was formed.

===The promotion: 1960s===
Pumas UNAM realized its objective of promotion from Segunda División to Primera División when Club Universidad won the home-played promotion match on January 9, 1962, by defeating Club Cataluña de Torreón, 9–1. The match ended, the students rushed the pitch, and honored its team by carrying them off the field on their shoulders—this was the first step towards the consolidation of the club.

The following day, dean Ignacio Chávez Sánchez congratulated the team when he met with them: Octavio Vial (manager), and players: Homero Villar, Raúl Chanes, José Antonio &quot;La Espátula&quot; Rodríguez, Roberto Cuevas, Rafael Ramirez Jimenez, Alfredo Echávarri, José Ruiz, Carlos Gutierrez, Alfredo &quot;Tito&quot; Zenteno, José Luis &quot;El Chango&quot; Ledezma, Antonio Sámano, Jorge Gaitán, Guillermo Vázquez Sr., José Luis González &quot;La Calaca&quot;, Lorenzo Garcia, Carlos Calderón de la Barca, Manuel &quot;Manolo&quot; Rodríguez, Edmundo &quot;El Poli&quot; Pérez, and Gustavo &quot;El Gato&quot; Cuenca.

The team established itself in the Primera División, the Board of Patrons prepared for the continuation of the team&#x27;s success by establishing youth system to develop new players.

===The legend begins: 1970s===

After two years under the management of Alfonso &quot;El Pescado&quot; Portugal, the Spaniard Ángel Zubieta took the reins of the team. This enabled the program to identify &quot;foreign&quot; reinforcements, but rely on promoting from the youth system.

The first half of the decade was marked by the arrival of three of the most important foreign players in the existence of the club; the Peruvian Juan José Muñante, the Serbian Velibor &quot;Bora&quot; Milutinović, and the Brazilian Cabinho. They arrived to join a solid base of native-players such as Miguel Mejía Barón, Héctor Sanabria, Arturo Vázquez Ayala, José Luis &quot;Pareja&quot; López, and Leonardo Cuellar. In the second half of the decade those same players would give the club its first titles in the top division.

In 1975 the club adopted a new administration consisting of an independent civil association that helped the university to support the club. In the 1974–75 season, Universidad won the Copa México and the Campeón de Campeones. In the 1976–77 season, Club Universidad became league champion for the first time in its history. That championship was followed by two sub championships. The culmination of a successful decade for Club Universidad came with the debut of Hugo Sánchez. In 1978, Club Universidad would signed Ricardo &quot;Tuca&quot; Ferretti, a player that will prove to be vital for the team in the coming decade.

===Consolidation: 1980s===
In the 1980–81 season, Universidad won its second league championship. That season was also the last season Hugo Sánchez played for the club. In the following season, the Pumas won the CONCACAF Championship and the Interamerican Cup.

This decade also marked the national recognition of the work performed by the club, and the revolutionary and dynamic style of play that helped Mexican football overall. For the 1986 FIFA World Cup, the Mexican Football Federation appointed the manager of Universidad, Velibor &quot;Bora&quot; Milutinović as the manager of the Mexico national football team. Milutinović called numerous Pumas and former Pumas to the nation team, including Hugo Sánchez, Félix Cruz Barbosa, Rafael Amador, Raúl Servín, Miguel España, Manuel Negrete and Luis Flores. This generation of players gave great satisfactions not only to the followers of Pumas, but also to the Mexican football fans.

===Ups and downs: 1990s===
The decade began with one of the most celebrated championships in club history, the 1990–91 League Championship against arch-rivals Club América - the memorable winning goal via free kick from Ricardo &quot;Tuca&quot; Ferretti. This will be the last game of Ricardo &quot;Tuca&quot; Ferretti due to retirement as a professional player. A new generation of players arrived, including Luis García, Jorge Campos, Claudio Suárez, Antonio Sancho, Israel López, Braulio Luna, Rafael García, Jaime Lozano, and Gerardo Torrado. This decade is, however, considered one of the least successful in terms of championships and development of players. Towards the end of the decade, Hugo Sánchez became manager of the club for the first time.

===Success: 2000s===
In 2004, Sánchez led the Pumas to their first championship in thirteen years. The Pumas were able to retain the championship later that year, becoming the first team since the Mexican league was split into two seasons to win back-to-back championships. As of summer 2012, they remain the only team to achieve this feat. Along with two domestic titles, the Pumas were also able to win both the Campeon de Campeones.

In 2005, the Pumas reached the Copa Sudamericana final, where they lost to Boca Juniors in a penalty shoot out when Roberto Abbondanzieri controversially stopped a penalty after having been forgiven a red card for handling the ball outside the penalty box denying a Pumas player a clear chance on goal. Domestically, the Pumas struggled after their 2004 success and, by 2006, were facing the threat of relegation. Ricardo Ferretti was appointed as manager that year in an effort to lead Pumas away from the relegation zone. The stability and discipline that Ferretti brought to the team paid off as the Pumas climbed out of the relegation zone and reached a final in 2007 against Atlante, which they lost 2–1 on aggregate. In 2009, Ferretti once again led the Pumas to a final, this time being victorious against Pachuca in extra time to claim the team&#x27;s sixth championship.

===Rejuvenating the Club: 2010s===

In 2011, Pumas became champions of Clausura 2011 tournament, winning their seventh championship against Monarcas Morelia.

After hard times at the club after the sacking of Guillermo Vasquez as head coach in 2012, he was re-hired as head coach in 2014. In Apertura 2015, Pumas made it to the tournament final against Tigres U.A.N.L. Tigres won the first leg of the Final with a home win of 3–0. Then in the second leg of the final Pumas managed to tie the game on the global scoreboard at home 4–1. A penalty-shootout had to be done and Tigres won the championship 4–2 at a penalty-shootout. Thus, making Pumas unable to gain its 8th title. After the club&#x27;s inability to make it to the play-offs in Clausura 2016 and failing to reach the semifinal for Copa Libertadores 2016 Guillermo Vasquez was once again sacked as head coach in May 2016.

At the end of May 2016, Pumas hired Francisco Palencia as head coach making Palencia debut as his first team to manage. Once again, in Apertura 2016 Pumas made it to the play-offs against Tigres for quarter finals. In the first leg with Pumas hosting the home game both teams tied 2-2. In the second leg Tigres hosting the home game, Tigres won 5–0. Thus, in the global scoreboard Pumas lost 7–2, and was not able to go further throughout the play-off stage.

In the Clausura 2017, Pumas had signed the Chilean forward Nicolas Castillo to give more firepower to the team&#x27;s attack. He scored 8 goals the first 2 months of the season before he was injured and was out for the rest of the season. Pumas then had a great streak of games the first half of the season. Starting gaming Game 14 they lost 4 straight games and were not able to score a goal. With these results they finished in 17th place and were the worst defensive team having 30 goals against and Nicolas Castillo missing out on the top scorer award by 1 goal to Raul Ruidiaz, of Monarcas Morelia who scored 9 goals.

In the Apertura 2017, many key players were sold or loaned out the loan, such as Alejandro Palacios, and long time captain Dario Veron, all with the purpose to make room for new, young players.

===2020s===
In the 2020 Apertura, Pumas reached the final, losing to Club Leon on a 3-1 Aggregate with coach Andres Lillini after sacking Michel the season prior. In 2022, Pumas reached the Champions League Final, losing to Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC on aggregate. After a poor 2023 Apertura, Lillini was sacked and was replaced with Rafael Puente Jr. After a poor start to the 2023 Clasura, Puente Jr. was sacked on March 20, 2023, with Pumas hiring Antonio &quot;Turco&quot; Mohamed to replace Puente shortly after. Mohamed&#x27;s time on the bench did not last long as he resigned shortly after Pumas&#x27; elimination in the semifinals of the 2023 Apertura to Tigres. Gustavo Alberto Lema, Mohamed&#x27;s former assistant has since succeeded him.

==Stadium==

Their home ground is the Estadio Olímpico Universitario, the main venue of the 1968 Summer Olympics. It has a seating capacity of over 72,000. The stadium is situated within the campus which enables easy access by the students. The Pumas have training facilities within the campus but their main complex is the Cantera, located nearby.

==Rivalries==

Universidad has strong rivalries with Club América and Cruz Azul. These games are passionate and followed by the whole city. There is also a small but historical rivalry UNAM has with Leones Negros

===Clásico Capitalino===

The rivalry with Club América began during the 1960s, when Universidad won its promotion to the top flight. Both clubs are located in Mexico City, creating a natural geographic rivalry. A few years later Club América bought Pumas UNAM idol Enrique Borja, even though the player had made a public statement that he did not want to be sold to Club América. In the 1980s the rivalry grew when Club América defeated Universidad twice in the league finals, both times with controversial refereeing decisions. The 1990s began with a &quot;victory&quot; of the Pumas over their rivals in the league finals, although it was actually a tie; the first leg was lost 3–2, and only the second leg was a 1–0 win. The aggregate score was 3–3, but Pumas UNAM scored two goals as the visiting team, giving them the edge. A new generation of players from the youth system grew up hating their adversaries; this decade is also marked by the birth of Las Barras Bravas, who supported both sides but had a much longer background story of rivalry. This rivalry is often referred to as the most violent of Mexico, with security measures exceeding those of any other game.

===Pumas UNAM vs. Cruz Azul===
The rivalry with Cruz Azul comes out of the fact that both clubs are located in Mexico City, and they have played many important matches, including two league finals, recently the name of this game is the &quot;Clásico Metropolitano” or “Derby central&quot; because both teams were born in states that are in the central part of Mexico

===Clásico Universitario===
Pumas UNAM and Leones Negros are old rivals. Both clubs are historical rivals due to both clubs being founded by rival universities. One major encounter these two clubs have had with each other was in the 1976-77 Primera División final, when Pumas UNAM beat Leones Negros to achieve their first title. But over the years the rivalry has died down due to the Leones Negros going through a state of decline and relegated to the Segunda División.

==Support==
The most recent survey from 2021 placed the club as the 4th largest fan base in Mexico, with 9,7% or 12 million supporters.
Historically, it was the third most popular club in Mexico, only behind Club América and CD Guadalajara, according to surveys conducted by Grupo Reforma and Consulta Mitofsky, from 2013 to 2015. However, considering the same polling sources, it fell to fourth in 2015, behind Cruz Azul.

===Barra Brava===
Pumas has 2 supporters&#x27; group (barra bravas), La Rebel and La Plus.

==Colors==
The team&#x27;s blue and gold colors were selected as a tribute to the University of Notre Dame, whose football coaches helped to develop an American-style football team at the university. The nickname was inspired by Roberto &#x27;Tapatio&#x27; Mendez, who coached the team from 1946 to 1964 and whose motivational speeches often compared his players to pumas. The nickname stayed with the public, and all the athletic teams representing the university have been called Pumas.

<text>A patio (, from ; &quot;courtyard&quot;, &quot;forecourt&quot;, &quot;yard&quot;, &quot;little garden&quot;) is an outdoor space generally used for dining or recreation that adjoins a structure and is typically paved. In Australia, the term is expanded to include roofed structures such as a veranda, which provides protection from sun and rain. Pronunciation can vary in Australia as well: &quot;patty-oh&quot; is perhaps more common generally although &quot;payshee-oh&quot; may be used by older Australians. 

==Construction==
Patios are most commonly paved with concrete or stone slabs (also known as paving flags). They can also be created using bricks, block paving, tiles, cobbles or gravel. Other kinds of patio materials these days include alumawood, aluminum, acrylic and glass. Other options include concrete, stamped concrete, and aggregate concrete.

==Restaurant patio==

&quot;Patio&quot; is also a general term used for outdoor seating at restaurants, especially in Canadian English. While common in Europe even before 1900, eating outdoors at restaurants in North America was exotic until the 1940s. The Hotel St. Moritz in New York in the 1950s advertised itself as having the first true continental cafe with outdoor seating. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; welcomed that city&#x27;s first patio in the 1960s. In the United States, having a warmer and sunnier climate than Northern Europe, outdoor dining grew rapidly in the 1960s and today is a popular dining experience in the warmer parts of the mainland.

<text>Richard Neilson Lochhead (born 24 May 1969) is a Scottish politician serving as the Minister for Business since 2023. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he served as the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Food and Environment from 2007 to 2016. Lochhead has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, first representing North East Scotland electoral region from 1999 to 2006, before representing the Moray constituency since 2006.

A native of Paisley, Lochhead is a graduate of the University of Stirling, where he studied Politics. He worked as an office manager for Alex Salmond, the Leader of the SNP at the time, from 1994 to 1998, before becoming an environmental development officer for Dundee City Council. He was elected to the inaugural Scottish Parliament in 1999, where he represented North East Scotland. In a 2006 by-election, Lochhead successfully succeeded Margaret Ewing in representing the Moray constituency, following her death. In the SNP&#x27;s opposition benches, he held portfolios on Environment, Energy, Fishing and Rural Affairs. Following the appointment of Salmond as First Minister of Scotland in 2007, he appointed Lochhead as the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment. He remained as the Rural Affairs Secretary under First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, but added food policy onto his portfolio. He stood down from government before the dissolution of the 4th Scottish Parliament and sat as a backbencher. In 2018, he returned to government, this time as a junior Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science, before being appointed in the new post of Minister for Just Transition, Employment and Fair Work.

==Early life ==
Richard Neilson Lochhead was born in Paisley on 24 May 1969. He attended Williamwood High School in Clarkston and Central College of Commerce in Glasgow before he graduated in 1994 in Political Studies from the University of Stirling. He worked for the SNP leader, Alex Salmond, as his Office Manager from 1994 to 1998, before becoming an environmental development officer for Dundee City Council. He was the SNP candidate in Gordon in the 1997 UK General Election, where he finished third. He subsequently fought the Aberdeen Central constituency in both 1999 and 2003, but came second to Lewis Macdonald each time.

==Political career==

=== SNP in opposition; 1999 to 2007 ===
Lochhead was elected to the Scottish Parliament at the 1999 election and re-elected at the 2003 election for the North East Scotland Region. In January 2006 he was selected as the SNP candidate for Moray for the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, following the announcement that Margaret Ewing MSP would be retiring. He beat Margaret Ewing&#x27;s sister-in-law, former MP Annabelle Ewing in the selection. Ewing&#x27;s premature death triggered a by-election and Lochhead resigned his additional member seat in April 2006 in order to successfully contest the Moray by-election. He was elected on 28 April 2006. This was the first time since the Second World War that an incumbent party had retained a by-election seat without losing votes or having their majority or share of the vote lowered.

He was convener of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament 11 June 2003 – 14 September 2004. In opposition he held the SNP&#x27;s portfolios on Environment, Energy, Fishing and Rural Affairs in the Scottish Parliament.

=== Rural Affairs Secretary; 2007 to 2016 ===
After the SNP&#x27;s victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, it was announced on 16 May 2007 that Lochhead would be the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Environment, taking up the position the following day. The junior Ministerial position of Minister for the Environment was initially given to Michael Russell (currently held by Aileen McLeod). In May 2007, Lochhead started his tenure with promises to &quot;relentlessly&quot; pursue the Scottish fishing interests on behalf of fishermen and their communities.

Lochhead was re-elected at the 2011 election with a further increased majority of 10,944. He announced his resignation as Environment Secretary, effective on 18 May 2016, as Nicola Sturgeon put together her reshuffle to appoint the second Sturgeon government.

=== Return to government; 2018 to present ===
On 31 August 2018 he was announced as Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science.

He retained his seat at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, with an increased majority, number of votes and percentage of votes cast. After the election, he was appointed as Minister for Just Transition, Employment and Fair Work.

Lochhead announced on 26 January 2025 that he would not seek re-election in 2026.

==Personal life==
Richard Lochhead is married to Fiona, and they have two children together.

He is a supporter of Aberdeen F.C.

<doc id="553206" wikidata="Q1418512" url="?curid=553206" title="Fiona Hyslop">
<text>Fiona Jane Hyslop (born 1 August 1964) is a Scottish politician who has served as Cabinet Secretary for Transport since 2024. Hyslop has served in various offices under first ministers Salmond, Sturgeon, Yousaf and Swinney; as education secretary, culture secretary, and economy secretary as well as in junior ministerial roles. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Linlithgow constituency since 2011, having represented the Lothians region from 1999 to 2011.

Hyslop was born in Ayrshire and spent her early years in England, before moving back to Scotland. She attended the University of Glasgow, where she earned a Masters of Art in Economic History and Sociology. She moved to Edinburgh and worked for the Standard Life Assurance Company. Hyslop joined the SNP in 1986 and spent her spare time campaigning in local elections. She unsuccessfully stood election to the British House of Commons for both the Edinburgh Leith and Edinburgh Central constituencies in the 1990s. In 1999, she was elected to the Scottish Parliament as an additional member for the Lothian regions.

After the SNP&#x27;s election victory in 2007, Hyslop was appointed by First Minister Alex Salmond as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, but was later sacked following threats of a motion of no confidence in 2009. She was demoted to junior Minister for Culture and External Affairs, which was later promoted to cabinet-level in 2011. She served as Culture Secretary from 2011 to 2020, where she then added economy on to her portfolio, as Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture. In 2021, following First Minister Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s cabinet reshuffle, she announced her intention to step down, having served 14 years in government.

Hyslop returned to the government as Minister for Transport in June 2023 under First Minister Humza Yousaf. She was promoted to Cabinet Secretary for Transport in February 2024 and was reappointed to the position by Yousaf&#x27;s successor, John Swinney.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood and education ===
Fiona Jane Hyslop was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, on 1 August 1964. At the age of three she moved to Grantham, England, where it made her feel Scotland was a &quot;distinct country&quot;. Her father died at a young age and her mother, a midwife, was left as a single parent to two children. Following the death of Hyslop&#x27;s father, her family returned to Ayrshire where she attended Alloway Primary School and later Ayr Academy. In the 1970s, she began to have an interest in politics through her mother&#x27;s friends, who were members of the Scottish National Party.

When Hyslop was 14, her mother married her step-father, a general practitioner, who had two children. Her step-brother was hospital catering manager and her step-sister was in the police, giving Hyslop a sense of the importance of public services. Her political awareness was enhanced in the 1980s, during the Thatcher years, to what she describes as the years Margaret Thatcher &quot;attacked&quot; public services.

Hyslop studied social sciences at the University of Glasgow and earned a Masters of Art in Economic History and Sociology. She also earned a Post-graduate Diploma in Industrial Administration from the Scottish College of Textiles. She moved to Edinburgh, where she worked for the Standard Life Assurance Company from 1986 to 1999.

=== Early political activism ===
Hyslop helped campaign for the Scottish National Party at a local by-election even though she was not a member. In 1986, she eventually joined the Scottish National Party. She described herself as never being a &quot;joiner&quot; and joined the SNP after she read their manifesto, and felt that Scottish independence most suited her interests. She became the party&#x27;s election agent for three regional candidates in the 1988 Scottish local elections and managed to win a seat.

Whilst working in Edinburgh, Hyslop spent her spare time campaigning for the SNP and was an active member of the Young Scots Nationalists, the SNP&#x27;s youth wing. She worked along with Charlie Reid of the Proclaimers and Angus Robertson. She worked on motions to move the SNP to a more centre-left, social democratic party. Hyslop became Vice Convener for Policy and served on the SNP Executive Committee.

Hyslop stood as a candidate in the 1988 Edinburgh District Council elections, and in the 1990 and 1994 Lothian Regional Council elections. She also stood as candidate for Edinburgh Leith and Edinburgh Central in the 1992 and 1997 UK General Elections respectively.

== Political career ==

=== SNP in opposition; 1999-2007 ===
Following the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament, Hyslop stood on the SNP&#x27;s additional list for the Lothian region and was elected in 1999. Her first years as Member of the Scottish Parliament, strengthened her views on Scottish independence after seeing the lack of powers the parliament really had.
In 2003, Hyslop sought re-election to the 2nd Scottish Parliament, this time as a candidate for the Linlithgow constituency. Although she failed to win this constituency, she was re-elected from the Lothian regional list. She felt frustrated by the lack of influence the parliament had over the Iraq war and believed Scotland&#x27;s place in the world &quot;would be far better strengthened by independence.&quot;

Hyslop, once again, stood for the Linlithgow constituency in the 2007 election. She lost the seat, again, but increased her vote share and retained her seat on the Lothian list.

=== Education Secretary; 2007-2009 ===
The SNP formed a minority government following the 2007 election, with Alex Salmond as First Minister. Salmond appointed Hyslop to his cabinet as the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, a portfolio she had previously shadowed. As Education Secretary, she passed the &quot;Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Act 2008,&quot; an Act of the Scottish Parliament to abolish the graduate endowment, and the &quot;Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009,&quot; which made provisions in relation to additional support needs. In December 2009, opposition parties called for Hyslop to be sacked, as Scottish Labour Leader Iain Gray stated that schools were in &quot;crisis&quot;. Labour threatened to motion a vote of no-confidence. With an SNP minority government, this made Hyslop almost certain to be ousted from office. Instead, Salmond sacked her from cabinet and she was demoted to a junior minister post of Minister for Culture and External Affairs.

In 2011 election to the 3rd Scottish parliament, Hyslop ran, again, for the Linlithgow constituency. After running twice, she successfully defeated Scottish Labour&#x27;s Mary Mulligan, gaining the constituency.

=== Culture Secretary; 2009-2020 ===
Following the SNP&#x27;s landslide victory in the 2011 election, she was promoted back to cabinet in Salmond&#x27;s second government as Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs. In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, she campaigned in favour of Scottish independence. 

Following the defeat of the Yes campaign in the referendum, Salmond resigned as First Minister and leader of the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Salmond and Hyslop remained in Sturgeon&#x27;s new cabinet. She added Europe onto her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Europe and External Affairs. In the 2016 EU Referendum, she campaigned to remain within the European Union, as she stated there would be &#x27;huge economic uncertainty&#x27;. In 2020, she added economy onto her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture.

=== Backbencher; 2021-2022 ===
Hyslop was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2021 election. Prior to Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s cabinet reshuffle, she announced that she would stand down from government, having served 14 years. As a backbencher, she served as Deputy Convener of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Economy and Fair Work Committee and was a member of the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee.

=== Transport Minister; 2023-2024 ===
In June 2023, she was appointed as the junior Minister for Transport, after Kevin Stewart&#x27;s resignation.

=== Transport Secretary; 2024-present ===
In February 2024, her Transport portfolio was elevated to be a full cabinet position and she was appointed as the new Cabinet Secretary for Transport. This came during a cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of Michael Matheson, the Health Secretary at the time. She was reappointed to the position by Yousaf&#x27;s successor, John Swinney.

==Personal life==
Hyslop lives in Linlithgow with her husband and their three children. She met her husband, Kenneth Anderson, through the SNP and the couple married in 1994.

<text>Campbell Martin (born 10 March 1960) is a Scottish journalist and former politician.

At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, he was elected on the Scottish National Party (SNP) list as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland. He was expelled from the SNP in 2004, and sat as an independent MSP until the 2007 election, when he stood in the Cunninghame North constituency but not the West of Scotland region. He was not re-elected.

==Political career==
Martin previously worked for Kay Ullrich, a SNP MSP. When she indicated she would stand down at the 2003 election, Martin was selected to be the candidate for Cunninghame North as well as being placed at the top of the SNP&#x27;s list. At the election, he was unsuccessful in the constituency vote, however, was elected as a regional member for the West of Scotland.

He was a prominent backer of Dr Bill Wilson who stood against John Swinney in the SNP leadership contest in 2003. He has been critical of the direction of the SNP since becoming an MSP, believing they are being dragged into the political centre away from their traditional left-of-centre position. He also believes the party is not vociferous enough in its advocation of Scottish independence.

He was suspended from the Scottish National Party on 25 April 2004 after making repeated public criticism of John Swinney, and was expelled from the SNP on 10 July 2004, soon after Swinney had resigned.

After becoming an Independent MSP, Campbell Martin played a prominent role in fighting a number of decisions taken by Labour-led North Ayrshire Council. He has also continued his opposition to what he considers to be the centre-right re-positioning of the SNP and its advocacy of a &#x27;culture of independence&#x27; rather than national independence.

Campbell Martin stood as an Independent candidate in the Cunninghame North constituency at the May 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, securing 4,423 votes (14.6%), but was not re-elected.

In August 2011 he joined the Scottish Socialist Party, and on 1 October 2011 he spoke at an SSP fringe meeting in Glasgow following the STUC anti-cuts demonstration. He participated as a delegate at the SSP national conference in March 2012. He was the SSP candidate for the Ardrossan and Arran ward on North Ayrshire Council in May 2012, but he was not elected.

He has claimed that the SNP has been infiltrated by MI5 agents. Writing in pro-independence website &quot;BarrheadBoy&quot;, Martin said: &quot;The SNP is completely compromised. It has been captured and controlled by the British state. The difference between those early days of the Scottish parliament and today, is that the British state assets in the SNP have, over the intervening years, risen through the ranks and now hold senior positions that have allowed them to influence party policies and direction, such as adopting a lack of urgency in delivering independence.&quot; He justified his claim by pointing out that intelligence services had previously infiltrated organisations like the Irish Republican Army and the National Union of Minerworkers.

==Journalism==
Between 2007 and 2015, Campbell Martin edited the3towns.com an online local newspaper covering the three North Ayrshire towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston. He is now the Creative Director of MacAulay Gibson Productions, an independent production company producing factual television programmes and business promos. He was involved in the production of &quot;The Only Game in Town&quot;, a documentary that looked at the procurement process for the North Ayrshire Schools Public Private Partnership project.

While still producing pro-independence articles for mainly online publications, Campbell Martin is no longer a member of a political party.

==Books==

* Campbell Martin&#x27;s autobiography – &quot;Was It Something I Said?&quot; () – was published in October 2021.
* A two-book series by Campbell Martin – &quot;Outspoken – Part One&quot; () and &quot;Outspoken – Part Two&quot; () – covering Scottish politics, society and international affairs over the past ten years (2013–2023) were re-published in July 2023.

<text>Freddie Dalton Thompson (August 19, 1942 – November 1, 2015) was an American politician, attorney, lobbyist, columnist, actor, and radio personality. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2003. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries for the 2008 United States presidential election.

He chaired the International Security Advisory Board at the U.S. Department of State, was a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as a visiting fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, specializing in national security and intelligence.

Usually credited as Fred Dalton Thompson, he appeared in a number of movies and television shows including &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, and &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, as well as in commercials. He frequently portrayed governmental authority figures and military men. In the final months of his U.S. Senate term in 2002, Thompson joined the cast of the NBC television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, starring as Manhattan District Attorney Arthur Branch.

==Early life==
Thompson was born at Helen Keller Memorial Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama on August 19, 1942, the son of Ruth Inez (née Bradley) and Fletcher Session Thompson (born Lauderdale County, Alabama, August 26, 1919, and died in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, May 27, 1990), who was an automobile salesman. Fred Thompson had English and distant Dutch ancestry. He attended public school in Lawrenceburg, graduating from Lawrence County High School in 1960 where he played high-school football. Thereafter, he worked days in the local post office, and nights at the Murray bicycle assembly plant.

Thompson grew up going to churches in the Churches of Christ. He said that his values came from &quot;sitting around the kitchen table&quot; with his parents, and from the Church of Christ. While talking to reporters at an event in South Carolina, Thompson said, &quot;I attend church when I&#x27;m in Tennessee. I&#x27;m [living] in McLean right now. I don&#x27;t attend regularly when I&#x27;m up there.&quot; Later in his adulthood, Thompson occasionally attended Vienna Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Virginia. He did not speak much about religion during his 2008 presidential campaign. He said, &quot;Me getting up and talking about what a wonderful person I am and that sort of thing, I&#x27;m not comfortable with that, and I don&#x27;t think it does me any good.&quot;

In September 1959, at the age of 17, Thompson married Sarah Elizabeth Lindsey. Their son, Freddie Dalton &quot;Tony&quot; Thompson Jr., was born in April 1960. Their son Daniel and daughter Elizabeth were born not long afterwards.

Thompson attended Florence State College (now the University of North Alabama), becoming the first member of his family to attend college. He later transferred to Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis), where he earned a double degree in philosophy and political science in 1964. He then received a scholarship to study law at the Vanderbilt University Law School, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in 1967. While Thompson was attending law school, he and Sarah both worked to pay for his education and support their three children. Thompson and his first wife divorced in 1985.

==Career as an attorney==
Thompson was admitted to the state bar of Tennessee in 1967. At that time, he shortened his first name from Freddie to Fred.
He worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1969 to 1972, successfully prosecuting bank robberies and other cases. Thompson was the campaign manager for Republican U.S. Senator Howard Baker&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1972, and was minority counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in its investigation of the Watergate scandal (1973–1974).

In the 1980s, Thompson worked as an attorney, with law offices in Nashville and Washington, DC, handling personal injury claims and defending people accused of white collar crimes. He also accepted appointments as special counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (1980–1981), special counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee (1982), and member of the Appellate Court Nominating Commission for the State of Tennessee (1985–1987).

His clients included a German mining group and Japan&#x27;s Toyota Motors Corporation. Thompson served on various corporate boards. He also did legal work and served on the board of directors for engineering firm Stone &amp; Webster.

===Role in Watergate hearings===
In 1973, Thompson was appointed minority counsel to assist the Republican senators on the Senate Watergate Committee, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate to investigate the Watergate scandal. Thompson was sometimes credited for supplying Republican Senator Howard Baker&#x27;s famous question, &quot;What did the President know, and when did he know it?&quot; This question is said to have helped frame the hearings in a way that eventually led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon. The question remains popular and is often invoked by pundits commenting on political scandals.

A Republican staff member, Donald Sanders, found out about the White House tapes and informed the committee on July 13, 1973. Thompson was informed of the existence of the tapes, and he, in turn, informed Nixon&#x27;s attorney, J. Fred Buzhardt. &quot;Even though I had no authority to act for the committee, I decided to call Fred Buzhardt at home,&quot; Thompson later wrote, &quot;I wanted to be sure that the White House was fully aware of what was to be disclosed so that it could take appropriate action.&quot;

Three days after Sanders&#x27;s discovery, at a public, televised committee hearing, Thompson asked former White House aide Alexander Butterfield the famous question, &quot;Mr. Butterfield, were you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President?&quot; thereby publicly revealing the existence of tape recordings of conversations within the White House. National Public Radio later called that session and the discovery of the Watergate tapes &quot;a turning point in the investigation.&quot;

Thompson&#x27;s appointment as minority counsel to the Senate Watergate committee reportedly upset Nixon, who believed Thompson was not skilled enough to interrogate unfriendly witnesses and would be outfoxed by the committee Democrats. According to historian Stanley Kutler, however, Thompson and Baker &quot;carried water for the White House, but I have to give them credit—they were watching out for their interests, too ... They weren&#x27;t going to mindlessly go down the tubes [for Nixon].&quot;

Journalist Scott Armstrong, a Democratic investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, is critical of Thompson for having disclosed the committee&#x27;s knowledge of the tapes to Buzhardt during an ongoing investigation, and says Thompson was &quot;a mole for the White House&quot; and that Thompson&#x27;s actions gave the White House a chance to destroy the tapes. Thompson&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;At That Point in Time&quot;, in turn, accused Armstrong of having been too close to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Bob Woodward and of leaking committee information to him. In response to renewed interest in this matter, in 2007 during his presidential campaign, Thompson said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad all of this has finally caused someone to read my Watergate book, even though it&#x27;s taken them over 30 years.&quot;

===Corruption case against Tennessee governor===
In 1977, Thompson represented Marie Ragghianti, a former Tennessee Parole Board chair, who had been fired for refusing to release felons after they had bribed aides to Democratic Governor Ray Blanton to obtain clemency. With Thompson&#x27;s assistance, Ragghianti filed a wrongful termination suit against Blanton&#x27;s office. During the trial, Thompson helped expose the cash-for-clemency scheme that eventually led to Blanton&#x27;s removal from office. In July 1978, a jury awarded Ragghianti $38,000 ($139,165.09 in 2016 dollars) in back pay and ordered her reinstatement.

==Career as a lobbyist==

Thompson earned about $1 million in total from his lobbying efforts. Except for the year 1981, his lobbying never amounted to more than one-third of his income. According to the Memphis &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot;:

Fred Thompson earned about half a million dollars from Washington lobbying from 1975 through 1993  ... Lobbyist disclosure records show Thompson had six lobbying clients: Westinghouse, two cable television companies, the Tennessee Savings and Loan League, the Teamsters Union&#x27;s Central States Pension Fund, and a Baltimore-based business coalition that lobbied for federal grants.

Thompson lobbied Congress on behalf of the Tennessee Savings and Loan League to pass the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, which deregulated the savings and loan industry. A large congressional majority and President Ronald Reagan supported the act, but it was said to be a factor that led to the savings and loan crisis. Thompson received $1,600 for communicating with some congressional staffers on this issue.

When Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in 1991, Thompson made a telephone call to White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocating restoration of Aristide&#x27;s government, but said that was as a private citizen, not on a paid basis on Aristide&#x27;s behalf.

Billing records show that Thompson was paid for about 20 hours of work in 1991 and 1992 on behalf of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, a family planning group trying to ease a George H. W. Bush administration regulation on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics.

After Thompson was elected to the Senate, two of his sons followed him into the lobbying business, but generally avoided clients where a possible conflict of interest might appear. When he left the Senate, some of his political action committee&#x27;s fees went to the lobbying firm of one of his sons.

==Initial acting career==
Marie Ragghianti&#x27;s case became the subject of a book, &quot;Marie&quot; which was written by Peter Maas and published in 1983. The film rights were purchased by director Roger Donaldson, who, after traveling to Nashville to speak with the people involved with the original case, asked Thompson if he wanted to play himself. The resulting film, &quot;Marie&quot;, was Thompson&#x27;s first acting role and was released in 1985. Roger Donaldson then cast Thompson in the part of CIA director Marshall in the 1987 film &quot;No Way Out&quot;. He played the head of FBI special-agent training in the 1988 comedy &quot;Feds&quot;; in the trailer, the FBI disclaimed any connection with the film. In 1990, he was cast as Ed Trudeau, the head of Dulles Airport, in the action sequel &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, as Rear Admiral Painter in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, and as Big John, the President of NASCAR, in the movie &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (patterned on &#x27;Big&#x27; Bill France).

Thompson went on to be cast in many films including as Tom Broadbent in &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991) and White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent in &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993). A 1994 &quot;New York Times&quot; profile wrote, &quot;When Hollywood directors need someone who can personify governmental power, they often turn to him.&quot; He also appeared in several television shows including &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot; and (eventually) a role on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

==United States Senate tenure==
===Election campaigns===

In 1994, Thompson was elected to finish the remaining two years of Al Gore&#x27;s unexpired U.S. Senate term. During the 1994 campaign, Thompson&#x27;s opponent was longtime Nashville Congressman Jim Cooper. Thompson campaigned in a red pickup truck, and Cooper charged Thompson &quot;is a lobbyist and actor who talks about lower taxes, talks about change, while he drives a rented stage prop.&quot; In a good year for Republican candidates, Thompson defeated Cooper in a landslide, overcoming Cooper&#x27;s early 20% lead in the polls to defeat him by an even greater margin. On the same night Thompson was elected to fill Gore&#x27;s unexpired term, political newcomer Bill Frist, a Nashville heart surgeon, defeated three-term incumbent Democrat Jim Sasser, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for Tennessee&#x27;s other Senate seat, which was up for a full six-year term. The twin victories by Thompson and Frist gave Republicans control of both of Tennessee&#x27;s Senate seats for the first time since Sasser ousted incumbent Bill Brock in 1976.

In 1996, Thompson was reelected (for the term ending January 3, 2003) with 61% of the vote, defeating Democratic attorney Houston Gordon of Covington, Tennessee, even as Bill Clinton and running mate Al Gore narrowly carried the state by less than three percentage points on their way to re-election. During this campaign, Mike Long served as Thompson&#x27;s chief speechwriter.

===Committee assignments===

In 1996, Thompson was a member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs when the committee investigated the alleged Chinese attempts to influence American politics. Thompson says he was &quot;largely stymied&quot; during these investigations by witnesses declining to testify, claiming the right not to incriminate themselves or by simply leaving the country. Thompson explained, &quot;Our work was affected tremendously by the fact that Congress is a much more partisan institution than it used to be.&quot;

Thompson became committee chairman in 1997, but was reduced to ranking minority member when the Democrats took control of the Senate in 2001. Thompson served on the Finance Committee (dealing with health care, trade, Social Security, and taxation), the Intelligence Committee, and the National Security Working Group.

Thompson&#x27;s work included investigation of the &quot;Umm Hajul controversy&quot; which involved the death of Tennessean Lance Fielder during the Gulf War. During his term, he supported campaign finance reform, opposed proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and promoted government efficiency and accountability. During the 1996 presidential debates, he also served as a Clinton stand-in to help prepare Bob Dole.

On February 12, 1999, the Senate voted on the Clinton impeachment. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction, and 55, including Thompson, against. The obstruction of justice charge was defeated with 50, including Thompson, for conviction, and 50 against. Conviction on impeachment charges requires the affirmative votes of 67 senators.

===Campaign co-chairman for John McCain&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign===
In the 2000 Republican Party presidential primaries, Thompson backed former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander, who eventually succeeded Thompson in the Senate two years later. When Alexander dropped out, Thompson endorsed Senator John McCain&#x27;s bid and became his national co-chairman. After George W. Bush won the primaries, both McCain and Thompson were considered as potential running mates.

===Ratings===
Thompson&#x27;s rating from the American Conservative Union was 86.1 (1995 to 2002), compared to 89.3 for Bill Frist, and 82.3 for John McCain. Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) characterized her colleague this way: &quot;I believe that Fred is a fearless senator. By that I mean he was never afraid to cast a vote or take a stand, regardless of the political consequences.&quot; Thompson was &quot;on the short end of a couple of 99–1 votes&quot;, voting against those who wanted to federalize matters that he believed were properly left to state and local officials.

With Thompson&#x27;s decision to campaign for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, his Senate record received some criticism from people who say he was &quot;lazy&quot; compared to other senators. Critics say that few of his proposals became law, and point to a 1998 quote: &quot;I don&#x27;t like spending 14- and 16-hour days voting on &#x27;sense of the Senate&#x27; resolutions on irrelevant matters. There are some important things we really need to get on with—and on a daily basis, it&#x27;s very frustrating.&quot; Defenders say he spent more time in preparation than other senators. Paul Noe, a former staffer, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;On the lazy charge, I have to chuckle because I was there sometimes until 1 in the morning working with the man.&quot;

===Personal life during Senate tenure===

In the years after his divorce, Thompson was romantically linked to country singer Lorrie Morgan, Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher, future Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, and columnist Margaret Carlson.

In July 1996, Thompson began dating Jeri Kehn (born 1966) and the two married almost six years later on June 29, 2002. When he was asked in an Associated Press survey of the candidates in December 2007, to name his favorite possession he replied, tongue-in-cheek, &quot;trophy wife&quot;. The couple had two children together, a daughter Hayden born in 2003, and a son Samuel born in 2006.

On January 30, 2002, Thompson&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Thompson Panici died from a brain injury resulting from cardiac arrest after what was determined to be an accidental overdose of prescription drugs.

==Initial post-Senate life and career==
Thompson was not a candidate for reelection in 2002. He had previously stated that he was unwilling to make serving in the Senate a long-term career. While he announced in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks his intention to seek reelection (declaring, &quot;now is not the time for me to leave&quot;), upon further reflection, he decided against running for reelection. The decision seems to have been prompted in large part by the death of his daughter.

The only lobbying work Thompson did after leaving the Senate in 2003 was for the London-based reinsurance company Equitas Ltd. He was paid $760,000 between 2004 and 2006 to help prevent passage of legislation that Equitas said unfairly singled them out for unfavorable treatment regarding asbestos claims. Thompson&#x27;s spokesman Mark Corrallo said that Thompson was proud to have been a lobbyist and believed in Equitas&#x27; cause.

===Return to acting===
As Thompson prepared to depart the Senate, he resumed his acting career. In 2002, during the final months of his Senate term, Thompson joined the cast of the NBC television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, playing conservative District Attorney Arthur Branch, a role that he would ultimately portray for the next five years. Thompson began filming during the August 2002 Senate recess. He made occasional appearances in the same role on other TV shows, such as &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, and the pilot episode of &quot;Conviction&quot;.

During these years, Thompson also had roles in films including &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; (2005) and &quot;Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World&quot; (2005). He portrayed a fictional president of the United States in &quot;Last Best Chance&quot; (2005), as well as two historical presidents in TV movies: Ulysses S. Grant in &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (2007) and the voice of Andrew Jackson in &quot;Rachel and Andrew Jackson: A Love Story&quot; (2001).

Thompson, in 2007, again paused his acting career in order to pursue political options, this time stepping back from acting in order to accommodate a potential campaign for the presidency. On May 30, 2007, he asked to be released from the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; role, potentially in preparation for a presidential bid. Due to concerns about the equal-time rule, reruns featuring the Branch character were not shown on NBC while Thompson was a potential or actual presidential candidate, but TNT episodes were unaffected.

===Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma diagnosis===
Thompson was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma (NHL), a form of cancer, in 2004. In 2007, Thompson stated, &quot;I have had no illness from it, or even any symptoms. My life expectancy should not be affected. I am in remission, and it is very treatable with drugs if treatment is needed in the future—and with no debilitating side effects.&quot; Reportedly , Thompson&#x27;s NHL was the lowest of three grades of NHL, and was the rare nodal marginal zone lymphoma. It accounts for only 1–3% of all cases.

===Political activities===

From 2002 to 2005, Thompson was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, DC.

In March 2003, Thompson was featured in a commercial by the conservative nonprofit group Citizens United which advocated for the invasion of Iraq, &quot;When people ask what has Saddam done to us, I ask, what had the 9/11 hijackers done to us--before 9/11.&quot;

Thompson did voice-over work at the 2004 Republican National Convention. While narrating a video for that convention, Thompson observed: &quot;History throws you what it throws you, and you never know what&#x27;s coming.&quot;

After the retirement of Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in 2005, President George W. Bush appointed Thompson to an informal position to help guide the nomination of John Roberts through the United States Senate confirmation process. Roberts&#x27; nomination as associate justice was cancelled following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; he was renominated and confirmed as Chief Justice instead.

Until July 2007, Thompson was Chair of the International Security Advisory Board, a bipartisan advisory panel that reports to the Secretary of State and focuses on emerging strategic threats. In that capacity, he advised the State Department about all aspects of arms control, disarmament, international security, and related aspects of public diplomacy.

===Legal defense for Lewis Libby===

In 2006, he served on the advisory board of the legal defense fund for I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby Jr., who was indicted and later convicted of lying to federal investigators during their investigation of the Plame affair. Thompson, who had never met Libby before volunteering for the advisory board, said he was convinced that Libby was innocent. The Scooter Libby Legal Defense Fund Trust set out to raise more than $5 million to help finance the legal defense of Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s former chief of staff. Thompson hosted a fundraiser for the Libby defense fund at his home in McLean, Virginia. After Bush commuted Libby&#x27;s sentence, Thompson released a statement: &quot;I am very happy for Scooter Libby. I know that this is a great relief to him, his wife and children. This will allow a good American, who has done a lot for his country, to resume his life.&quot;

===Work as a radio analyst===
In 2006, he signed on with ABC News Radio to serve as senior analyst and vacation replacement for Paul Harvey. He used that platform to spell out his positions on a number of political issues. A July 3, 2007, update to Thompson&#x27;s ABC News Radio home page referred to him as a &quot;former ABC News Radio contributor&quot;, indicating that Thompson had been released from his contract with the broadcaster. He did not return after his campaign ended.

===Work as a columnist===
Thompson signed a deal with Salem Communications&#x27;s Townhall.com to write for the organization&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Townhall&quot;, from April 23, 2007, until August 21, 2007, and again from June 8, 2008, until November 17, 2008.

==2008 presidential campaign==

Thompson ran for the Republican nomination in the 2008 United States presidential election cycle. He won 11 delegates in the Republican primaries before dropping out of the race in January 2008.

On March 11, 2007, Thompson appeared on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; to discuss the possibility of a 2008 candidacy for the presidency. Two weeks later Thompson asked to be released from his television contract, potentially in preparation for a presidential bid. Thompson formed a presidential exploratory committee regarding his possible 2008 campaign for president on June 1, 2007, but unlike most candidate exploratory groups, Thompson&#x27;s organized as a 527 group.

Thompson continued to be mentioned as a potential candidate, but did not officially declare his candidacy. On June 12, he told Jay Leno on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that while he did not crave the presidency itself, he would like to do things that he could only do by holding that office. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article cited Thompson&#x27;s aides as saying on July 18 that he planned to enter the race just after Labor Day, followed by a national announcement tour.

On September 5, 2007, Thompson made his candidacy official, announcing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that &quot;I&#x27;m running for president of the United States&quot; and running an ad during a Republican presidential candidates&#x27; debate on &quot;Fox News&quot;. In both instances he pointed people to his campaign website to watch a 15-minute video detailing his platform. His campaign entrance was described as &quot;lackluster&quot; and &quot;awkward&quot; despite high expectations in anticipation of his joining the race. Thompson was endorsed by the Virginia Society for Human Life and several other anti-abortion organizations.

In nationwide polling toward the end of 2007, Thompson&#x27;s support in the Republican primary election was sliding, with Thompson placing either third or fourth in polls. On January 22, 2008, after attracting little support in the early primaries, he confirmed that he had withdrawn from the presidential race. In a statement issued by his campaign he said:

Today I have withdrawn my candidacy for President of the United States. I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort. Jeri and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people.

==Post-presidential campaign==
===Political activities===
Thompson spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention on September 2 in Minnesota, where he described in graphic detail presumptive Republican nominee John McCain&#x27;s torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese during his imprisonment and gave an endorsement of McCain for president.

Thompson campaigned in support of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

===Acting career===
Thompson signed an agreement to be represented as an actor by the William Morris Agency. In 2009, he returned to acting with a guest appearance on the ABC television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, and as William Jennings Bryan in the TV movie &quot;Alleged&quot; (2010), based on the Scopes Monkey Trial. Thompson portrayed Frank Michael Thomas in the CBS series &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, based on himself. He also had roles in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Secretariat&quot; (2010) and the horror film &quot;Sinister&quot; (2012). In 2014, he appeared in the film &quot;Persecuted&quot;, focusing on religious freedom, government surveillance, and censorship.

===Radio career===
On March 2, 2009, he took over Westwood One&#x27;s East Coast noon time slot, hosting the talk radio program &quot;The Fred Thompson Show&quot;, after Bill O&#x27;Reilly ended &quot;The Radio Factor&quot;. It was co-hosted for a time by his wife, Jeri. Thompson&#x27;s final show for Westwood One was aired on January 21, 2011. Douglas Urbanski took Thompson&#x27;s place in the Westwood One syndication lineup.

===Work as an advertising spokesman===
In May 2010, Thompson became an advertising spokesman for American Advisors Group, a reverse mortgage lender.

===Memoir===
Thompson&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Teaching the Pig to Dance: A Memoir of Growing up and Second Chances&quot;, was published in 2010.

===Death and funeral===
On the morning of November 1, 2015, Thompson died at the age of 73; the cause of death was a recurrence of lymphoma. His funeral was held on November 6, 2015, in Nashville with U.S. Senators John McCain and Lamar Alexander in attendance. He was interred at Mimosa Cemetery in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee later that day.

The Fred D. Thompson U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building was named in his honor pursuant to legislation signed into law in June 2017.

==Political positions==

Thompson said that federalism was his &quot;lodestar&quot;, which provides &quot;a basis for a proper analysis of most issues: &#x27;Is this something government should be doing? If so, at what level of government?&#x27;&quot;

Thompson said that &quot;&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was bad law and bad medical science&quot;; he felt that judges should not be determining social policy. However, he also said that the government should not criminally prosecute women who undergo early-term abortions. He did not support a federal ban on gay marriage, but would have supported a constitutional amendment to keep a state&#x27;s recognition of such marriages from resulting in all states having to recognize them.

He said that citizens are entitled to keep and bear arms if they do not have criminal records. The Gun Owners of America says that he voted pro-gun in 20 of 33 gun-related votes during his time in the Senate.

Thompson said that U.S. borders should be secured before considering comprehensive immigration reform, but he also supported a path to citizenship for illegal aliens saying, &quot;You&#x27;re going to have to, in some way, work out a deal where they can have some aspirations of citizenship, but not make it so easy that it&#x27;s unfair to the people waiting in line and abiding by the law.&quot; Thompson supported the U.S. 2003 invasion of Iraq
and was opposed to withdrawing troops, but believed that &quot;mistakes have been made&quot; since the invasion.

Thompson initially supported the McCain–Feingold campaign finance legislation, but he later said that certain parts should be repealed. He was skeptical that human efforts cause global warming and pointed to parallel warming on Mars and other planets as an example.

<text>Bruce James McFee (18 May 1961 – 9 September 2021) was a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region at the 2003 election. McFee served on the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Procedures and Justice Committees. He was involved in local campaigns to save Ferguson&#x27;s shipyard in Port Glasgow and to retain the name of the University of Paisley.

He had previously served as leader of the SNP group on Renfrewshire Council and was re-elected to the council in 2007, representing the Johnstone North, Kilbarchan and Lochwinnoch ward. He did not seek re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2007 and retired from local government at the 2012 Scottish local elections.

McFee suffered a stroke in March 2019, which saw him enter full-time care thereafter. He died in Paisley, Renfrewshire on 9 September 2021 at the age of 60.

<text>The National Trust of Australia, officially the Australian Council of National Trusts (ACNT), is the Australian national peak body for community-based, non-government non-profit organisations committed to promoting and conserving Australia&#x27;s Indigenous, natural and historic heritage. The umbrella body was incorporated in 1965, with member organisations in every state and territory of Australia.

== History ==
Modelled on the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty and inspired by local campaigns to conserve native bushland and preserve old buildings, the first Australian National Trusts were formed in New South Wales in 1945, South Australia in 1955 and Victoria in 1956; followed later in Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. The two Territory Trusts were the last to be founded, in 1976 (see below).

The driving force behind the establishment of the National Trust in Australia was Annie Forsyth Wyatt (1885–1961). She lived for much of her life in a cottage in Gordon, New South Wales, which is still standing. She was living in the Sydney suburb of St Ives when she died.

The organisation was incorporated in 1965. The umbrella body federates the eight autonomous National Trusts in each Australian state and internal self-governing territory, providing them with a national secretariat and a national and international presence.

==Description==
The trust is Australia&#x27;s national peak body for community-based, non-government non-profit organisations committed to promoting and conserving Australia&#x27;s Indigenous, natural and historic heritage.

Collectively, the constituent National Trusts own or manage over 300 heritage places (the majority held in perpetuity), and manage a volunteer workforce of 7,000 while also employing about 350 people nationwide, . Around visitors experience the properties and their collections in Australia each year.

== Constituent organisations ==
, the National Trust&#x27;s constituent organisations were:

===NSW===
In 1975, the National Trust moved into the former Fort Street High School building on Observatory Hill, after the girls&#x27; school moved to Petersham to be reunited with the boys&#x27; school, which had moved in 1916. The distinctive building, which retains its appearance from the time of its conversion to a school in 1849, is visible from the approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

<text>Formula Three, also called Formula 3, abbreviated as F3, is a third-tier class of open-wheel formula racing. The various championships held in Europe, Australia, South America and Asia form an important step for many prospective Formula One drivers.

==History==
Formula Three (adopted by the FIA in 1950) evolved from postwar auto racing, with lightweight tube-frame chassis powered by 500 cc motorcycle engines (notably Nortons and JAP speedway). The 500 cc formula originally evolved in 1946 from low-cost &quot;special&quot; racing organised by enthusiasts in Bristol, England, just before the Second World War; British motorsport after the war picked up slowly, partly due to petrol rationing which continued for a number of years and home-built 500 cc cars engines were intended to be accessible to the &quot;impecunious enthusiast&quot;. The second post-war motor race in Britain was organised by the VSCC in July 1947 at RAF Gransden Lodge, 500cc cars being the only post-war class to run that day. Three of the seven entrants were non-starters, and, of the four runners, all but one retired on the first lap, leaving Eric Brandon in his Cooper Prototype (T2) trailing round to a virtual walk-over at an average speed of , though his best lap (which was the fastest recorded for any 500) was .

Cooper came to dominate the formula with mass-produced cars, and the income this generated enabled the company to develop into the senior categories. Other notable marques included Kieft, JBS and Emeryson in England, and Effyh, Monopoletta and Scampolo in Europe. John Cooper, along with most other 500 builders, decided to place the engine in the middle of the car, driving the rear wheels. This was mostly due to the practical limitations imposed by chain drive but it gave these cars exceptionally good handling characteristics which eventually led to the mid-engined revolution in single-seater racing.
The 500cc formula was the usual route into motor racing through the early and mid-1950s (and stars like Stirling Moss continued to enter selected F3 events even during their GP careers). Other notable 500 cc Formula 3 drivers include Stuart Lewis-Evans, Ivor Bueb, Jim Russell, Peter Collins, Don Parker, Ken Tyrrell, and Bernie Ecclestone.

From a statistical point of view, Parker was the most successful F3 driver. Although coming to motor racing late in life (at age 41 in 1949), he won a total of 126 F3 races altogether, and was described by &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine (in his 1998 obituary) as &quot;the most successful Formula 3 driver in history&quot;. Although Stirling Moss was already a star by 1953, Parker beat him more than any other driver, and was Formula 3 Champion in 1952, again in 1953, and in 1954 he only lost the title by a half-point. He took the title for a third time in 1959.

500cc Formula Three declined at an international level during the late 1950s, although it continued at a national level into the early 60s, being eclipsed by Formula Junior for 1000 or 1100 cc cars (on a sliding scale of weights).

A one-litre Formula Three category for four-cylinder carburetted cars, with heavily tuned production engines, was reintroduced in 1964 based on the Formula Junior rules and ran to 1970. These engines (a short-stroke unit based on the Ford Anglia with a special 2-valve Cosworth or Holbay OHV down-draught head, initially pioneered by Brian Hart, being by far the most efficient and popular) tended to rev very highly and were popularly known as &quot;screamers&quot;; F3 races tended to involve large packs of slipstreaming cars. The &quot;screamer&quot; years were dominated by Brabham, Lotus and Tecno, with March beginning in 1970. Early one-litre F3 chassis tended to descend from Formula Junior designs but quickly evolved.

For 1971 new regulations allowing 1600 cc engines with a restricted air intake were introduced. The 1971–73 seasons were contested with these cars, as aerodynamics started to become important.

Two-litre engine rules were introduced for 1974, still with restricted air intakes. engine regulations remain basically unchanged in F3, a remarkable case of stability in racing regulations.

As the likes of Lotus and Brabham faded from F3 to concentrate on Formula One, F3 constructors of the 1970s included Alpine, Lola, March, Modus, GRD, Ralt, and Ensign.
By the start of the 1980s however, Formula Three had evolved well beyond its humble beginnings to something closely resembling the modern formula. It was seen as the main training ground for future Formula One drivers, many of them bypassing Formula Two to go straight into Grand Prix racing. The chassis became increasingly sophisticated, mirroring the more senior formulae – ground effects were briefly used in the early 1980s but were banned, in line with other FIA single-seater formulae; carbon fibre chassis started to be introduced from the mid-1980s.

Historically, March (up to 1981), Ralt (up to the early 1990s) and Reynard (1985–1992) had been the main chassis manufacturers in two-litre F3, with Martini fairly strong in France; Reynard pioneered use of carbon fibre in the mid-1980s replacing traditional aluminium or steel monocoque structures. Dallara however, after an unsuccessful Formula One project, focussed their attention on the formula in the early nineties and obliterated all the other marques with their F393. Within a couple of years, the chassis was considered a prerequisite to competitiveness, and today Dallara chassis are ubiquitous to the formula. In order to keep costs down, their chassis have had a three-year life-cycle, with only minor annual updates. It was agreed however to extend the life-cycle of the current F308 to four years to assist teams; this chassis however, has been replaced in 2012 with the new F312 chassis, intended to be run until 2017. Most F3 championships, most notably the British series, offer a secondary class for cars from the previous life-cycle in order to provide a cheap point of entry for lesser funded teams and drivers.

==F3 cars==
Formula Three cars are monocoque chassis, using slick racing tyres and wings. Currently, Dallara manufactures the overwhelming majority of F3 cars, though Mygale, Lola (formerly in partnership with Dome of Japan), Arttech, and SLC also have a limited output. In many smaller or amateur F3 racing series older cars are frequently seen. Usually these series are divided into two or more classes, to allow more participation.

Engines in FIA Formula 3 are all 3.4-litre, 6-cylinder naturally aspirated spec engines. 

Engines in others Formula 3 series must be built from a production model block (&quot;stock block&quot;), and often must be sealed by race or series organizers, so no private tuning can be carried out. Honda engines (prepared by Mugen) have perennially been popular, as have engines produced by Volkswagen, Alfa Romeo, or Renault. Currently the HWA-tuned Mercedes and the Volkswagen engines dominate the British and European series, with Mugen, TOM&#x27;S–Toyota, Opel, and Fiat being used by some teams.

==Championships and series==
Until the launch of the FIA Formula 3 Championship in 2019, there has never been a World Championship for Formula Three. In the 1970s and into the 1980s the European Formula Three Championship and British Formula 3 Championship (once one series had emerged from the competing British series in the 1970s) were the most prominent, with a number of future Formula One champions coming from them. France, Germany, and Italy also had important Formula Three series, but interest in these was originally subsidiary to national formulae – Formula Renault in France and Formula Super Vee in Germany. These nations eventually drifted towards Formula Three. The Italian series tended to attract older drivers who moved straight across from karting whereas in other nations drivers typically graduated to F3 after a couple of years in minor categories. The European series died out in the mid-1980s and the national series became correspondingly more important. For 2003, French and German F3, both suffering from a lack of competitive entrants, merged to recreate the Formula 3 Euro Series.

Brazil&#x27;s SudAm Formula Three Championship, which now has the most powerful engine of all Formula Three series, was known for producing excellent drivers who polished their skills in the British Formula 3 championship. Perhaps the most curious of all was the small All-Japan Formula Three Championship. Although few drivers spent a significant amount of time there, future stars such as Ralf Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve scored victories there. An Asian series was established in 2001 and grew to produce past A1 drivers for Indonesia and Australia.

===Special races===
In addition to the many national series, Formula Three is known for major non-championship races typically including entries from the national series, the best-known of which is the FIA Formula 3 World Cup (previously known as FIA Formula 3 Intercontinental Cup) at Macau. The first Formula Three Grand Prix of Macau was held in 1983 and won by Ayrton Senna. Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, and Takuma Sato have also won there. The Formula Three Grand Prix of Macau traditionally marks the end of the Formula Three season, with drivers from almost every national series participating.

Other major races include the Pau Grand Prix (from 1999 to 2006), the Masters of Formula 3 (traditionally held at Zandvoort), and the Korea Super Prix at Changwon. These events give fans in locations not visited by other major series a way to experience major international racing.

The Monaco F3 Grand Prix held until 1997 was also a famous special race. It was restored in 2005 only, as a part of the F3 Euro Series.

<text>John Ostashek (May 10, 1936 – June 10, 2007) was a Yukon politician. An entrepreneur, he was elected leader of the Yukon Party in June 1992 and led it to victory in the fall 1992 election in which he also won a seat in the legislature for the first time.

Ostashek declined to use the title Premier adopted by his predecessor, Tony Penikett and preferred to be called &quot;Government Leader&quot;. Ostashek&#x27;s minority government, which was kept in power with the support of right leaning independent MLAs, was a conservative one which instituted welfare reform and a reduction of public services. Soon after coming into power, his government signed land claims agreements with four First Nations communities in the Yukon which had been negotiated by the previous government.

Ostashek&#x27;s Yukon Party lost the 1996 election to the Yukon NDP though he retained his seat and became leader of the opposition. In the 2000 election however his Yukon Party was again defeated, this time by the Liberals with Ostashek losing his own seat. He subsequently resigned as Yukon Party leader and retired from politics.

He died on June 10, 2007, from cancer in Vancouver, after having been medevaced from Whitehorse the week before.

<doc id="553266" wikidata="Q592260" url="?curid=553266" title="Danube–Black Sea Canal">
<text>The Danube–Black Sea Canal () is a navigable canal in Romania, which runs from Cernavodă on the Danube river, via two branches, to Constanța and Năvodari on the Black Sea. Administered from Agigea, it is an important part of the waterway link between the North Sea and the Black Sea via the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal. The main branch of the canal, with a length of , which connects the Port of Cernavodă with the Port of Constanța, was built in 1976–1984, while the northern branch, known as the Poarta Albă–Midia Năvodari Canal, with a length of , connecting Poarta Albă and the Port of Midia, was built between 1983 and 1987.

Although the idea of building a navigable canal between the Danube and the Black Sea is old, the first concrete attempt was made between 1949 and 1953, when the communist authorities of the time used this opportunity to eliminate political opponents, so the canal became notorious as the site of labor camps, when at any given time, between 5,000 and 20,000 detainees, mostly political prisoners, worked on its excavation. The total number of prisoners used as labor force during this period is unknown, with the total number of deaths being estimated at several tens of thousands. The construction works of the Danube–Black Sea Canal were to be resumed 20 years later, in different conditions.

==Geography==
The course of the canal follows mostly the course of the former river Carasu, originally a tributary of the Danube. Therefore, hydrographically it also has the function of conveying the runoff from a drainage basin to the Black Sea.

The main branch extends from Cernavodă on the Danube to Poarta Albă. On this reach it goes near or through the settlements of Cernavodă, Saligny, Mircea Vodă, Medgidia, Castelu, and Poarta Albă. On this reach the canal is joined on the north bank by tributaries (from west to east): Valea Cișmelei, Valea Plantației, Agi Cabul, Castelu and Nisipari. On the south bank it is joined by tributaries (from west to east) Popa Nica and Medgidia.

At Poarta Albă the canal bifurcates into two branches. The main canal goes to the south, towards the Port of Constanța Sud Agigea. It passes near the settlements of Murfatlar, Cumpăna and Agigea. On its reach it is joined on the northeast bank by tributaries Valea Seacă and Lazu and on the southwest bank by the Siminoc, Șerplea, Potârnichea and Agigea.

The northern branch, the Poarta Albă–Midia Năvodari Canal, goes towards the Port of Midia. It passes near Nazarcea, Lumina, Ovidiu and Năvodari. On its reach it is joined by tributaries Cocoș, Nazarcea and Valea Adâncă.

===Motivation===
The main reasons for the building of the canal were to circumvent the Danube Delta which is difficult to navigate, shorten the distance to the Black Sea and several issues related to the loading and unloading of ships.

In its delta, the Danube is divided into three main branches, none of which is suited to optimal navigation: the Chilia branch is the deepest, but its mouths were not stable, which made navigation dangerous; the Sulina branch is not deep enough for maritime ships and it also used to be isolated from the railroad system; the Sfântu Gheorghe branch is shallow and sinuous.

At the time when the decision to build the canal was taken, it was officially announced that these works would also serve a secondary purpose, that of land reclamation, with the drainage of marshes in the area. Also during the construction period, the Danube–Black Sea Canal was advertised as a fast and direct connection between the Soviet Volga–Don Canal and Central Europe.

===Dimensions===
The main branch reduces the distance by boat from Constanța to Cernavodă by ca. . It has a width of and a depth of ; the northern arm has a length of , width of and a depth of . The radius of its sharpest bends is for the main branch, and , for the northern branch.

The waterway passes through the towns of Medgidia and Murfatlar, both of which have been turned into inland ports. It was designed to facilitate the transit of convoys comprising as much as six towed barges, up to 3,000 in tonnage each (respectively, a total of 18,000 in tonnage), in length and wide (ships of up to 5,000 in tonnage, as long as and with as much as in beam and in draft can also pass through the canal). The structure is bound by four locks (in Cernavodă and Agigea, and in Ovidiu and Năvodari, respectively).

In its final phase, the canal took over nine years to construct; of soil were excavated (greater than the amount involved in building the Panama and Suez canals), and of concrete were used for the locks and support walls.

==History==

===Precedents===
The earliest plans for building this canal were drawn in the late 1830s. The 1829 Treaty of Adrianople canceled the trade monopoly of the Ottoman Empire in the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, allowing these countries to build their own fleets by 1834. Both Romanian and non-Romanian ships used mostly the Danube port cities of Brăila and Galați, which saw an economic boom. But there were a number of barriers to this trade: the Ottomans controlled the navigation regime on the Danube, while the Russian Empire controlled access to the Black Sea in the Danube Delta, and there was little the Danubian Principalities could do to rectify this situation. Both countries welcomed the Austrian Empire&#x27;s 1834 decision, endorsed by Count István Széchenyi, to extend the steamboat navigation to the maritime Danube. The Austrian initiative was badly received by the Russians, who considered their trade through Odesa and ports in the Crimea threatened by the development of Brăila and Galați. Without resolving to direct measures, the Russian Empire, who controlled the Sulina branch, started to show rigidity, instituting on February 7, 1836, a compulsory quarantine on the island of Letea, collecting taxes to cover the Russian financial deficit, and by not performing maintenance for the navigation on the Sulina branch to remove the continuous deposits of sand.

This prompted the Austrians to conceive the idea of building a canal to connect the Danube with the Black Sea at the shortest point before the Delta, between Rasova or Cernavodă (&quot;Bogaz Köi&quot;) and Constanța (&quot;Küstendjie&quot;), and a parallel railway. The Austrian project, however, was rejected by the Ottoman Porte. Western diplomats and newspapers accused the Russian government that through bribing and intimidation, it determined the Ottoman officials to reject the proposal of Szechenyi&#x27;s company. In 1839, Széchenyi got the approval of his and Ottoman governments to ensure the transport of goods and people without getting to Sulina by a transshipment on dry land. Carts and coaches made a 7–8 hour trip from Cernavodă to Constanța, where people and goods were boarding other ships for Istanbul. The enterprise was scrapped after 4 years due to non-profitability because of a low number of passengers, high cost of transport, and poor conditions of cargo handling in the unfit roadstead of the port of Constanța.

In its place, a new Brăila–Istanbul route was established. However, by 1844, the depth of the Sulina branch had decreased to 7–9 feet, from 13–14 feet in 1836, due to lack of dredging by the Russian authorities which controlled the passage. The Austrian government made a new attempt to cut a canal, sending the military engineer Colonel Baron Karl von Bigaro to prospect the land. But the idea had to be abandoned again due to technical problem, first of all due to the unfitness of the port of Constanța for large international trade.

In 1850, the Moldavian scholar Ion Ionescu de la Brad proposed yet another project, supported by Ion Ghica and by the Scottish diplomat David Urquhart, the secretary of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Embassy in the Ottoman Empire. Ghica lobbied Brad&#x27;s project to Ahmed Vefik, who gave a negative response for fear of provoking Russia.

The Crimean War of 1854–1856, added a military and strategical dimension for this plan. The British and French allies landed at Varna in the summer of 1854, followed by the withdrawal of Russian troops from Wallachia and Moldavia and the advancement of Ottoman and Austrian ones. In 1855, the French government put forward an initiative, and the Ottomans approved it, for the cheapest solution: build a strategic road between Cernavodă and Constanța. Engineer Charles Lalanne was put in charge of these works, that started in the summer of 1855 and were finished by the year&#x27;s end. According to the newspaper &quot;Zimbrul&quot; of Iași, the work was performed by 300 physically strong men of moderate character selected in Moldavia and Wallachia.

The building of the road did not eliminate, however, the need for a canal, and the Austrian government renewed its persuading efforts. According to &quot;Gazeta de Transilvania&quot; in July 1855, Baron Karl Ludwig von Bruck, the Austrian Finance Minister, founded a stock company to build the desired canal. According to an article in &quot;Zimbrul&quot; on July 23, 1855, the project was of interest to Britain, the French Empire and the Austrian Empire, who were asking the Ottoman government to allot the concession of the canal and the fitting of the port of Constanța to a consortium under the direction of the three countries. The Ottomans were to lease a league of land on each side of the canal for 99 years, where colonist could be settled. Goods were to travel freely, with ships having to pay only a &quot;per tone&quot; tax, significantly lower than the one on the Sulina branch. According to the newspaper &quot;Steaua Dunării&quot; from January 24, 1856, the Sultan issued a &quot;firman&quot; to the Anglo-French–Austrian consortium Wilson–Morny–Breda, represented by Forbes Campbell, authorizing it to build the canal which was to be called Abdul Medjid. The 12 articles of the Concession Act were published in &quot;Bukurester Deutsche Zeitung&quot;.

The construction plans for the canal took a different turn with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on March 30, 1856, ending the war. Russia ceded the Danube mouths to the Ottomans and southern Bessarabia (lately organised as the Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to their vassal, Moldavia. The freedom of international navigation on the Danube was restored; passage taxes were canceled, police and quarantine rules were simplified; and the European Commission of the Danube was established, with representatives of seven powers: Britain, France, Austria, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. The commission was responsible for the clearing of the Danube mouths from deposits of the river, and when necessary with clearing natural barriers, with the goal of ensuring of good conditions for navigation. The effect was that Austria, Britain, and France changed their attitude to the project for a Danube–Black Sea canal. The newspaper &quot;Zimbrul&quot; announced on May 25, 1856 that the plan for building the canal was abandoned; instead a railroad line between Cernavodă and Constanța was to be built. After two and a half years of construction, the line was inaugurated on October 4, 1860. Following the opening of the line, goods were easily and inexpensively transported from Constanța by rail, so plans for a canal were again abandoned.

As the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (1859) remained formally Ottoman vassals, and moreover Dobruja was directly administered by the Ottomans, the idea to build the canal was not of interest to the Romanians at that time. But following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Romania acquired formal independence, lost again southern Bessarabia to Russia, but gained Dobruja. The idea to build a canal became a national issue, which could promote Romania&#x27;s international trade. However, in the following years the development of trade was concentrated mainly on the Sulina Canal. Another project was consequently rejected by King Carol I after consultations with Grigore Antipa. During World War I, Austro-Hungarian authorities taking part in the occupation of southern Romania proposed a canal from Cernavodă to Constanța, passing through Murfatlar, of which 10 miles between Cernavodă and Murfatlar would be in a tunnel and the rest of 27 miles would be in the open.

In 1927, the Romanian engineer Jean Stoenescu-Dunăre drafted a new set of plans. Afterwards, because of the Great Depression, World War II, and political turmoil in Romania (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;), construction did not start until 1949, after the establishment of the Romanian Communist regime.

===First attempt (1949–1953)===
The idea of starting the construction of the Danube–Black Sea Canal seems to have been suggested to Romanian leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin during a visit to the Moscow Kremlin in 1948. Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s chief of staff stated that Stalin indicated the canal as a means of getting rid of the rich peasants and of the so-called &quot;enemies of the people&quot; and promised support to the authorities in identifying the people hostile to the regime and by providing construction equipment for the canal. He also stated that Gheorghiu-Dej was not convinced by Stalin&#x27;s recommendations, suspecting that the canal was actually part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s expansion strategy. It has since been found out that Stalin&#x27;s initiative was based on a secret study, commissioned in 1947–1948, which recommended building a Soviet submarine base at the Port of Midia, which was suitable due to its proximity to the Bosphorus and because of the rocky foundation.

On May 25, 1949, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party was presented a report by Gheorghiu-Dej on the projected construction of a canal linking the Danube and the Black Sea and on the economic and cultural development of the neighboring area. Estimating that this important construction was an important component of the construction of socialism in Romania, the Politburo recommended that the project be submitted to the Council of Ministers for the approval of the immediate start of the preparatory work for the construction of the canal. On the same day Gheorghiu-Dej, at that time first vice-president of the Council of Ministers, presented his proposal to the council, presided by Petru Groza, which approved it immediately. Work started on June 29. In a speech held on August 22, 1949 Anna Pauker hailed the construction of the canal claiming &quot;we are building the canal without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie&quot;. Banners with this slogan were set up in all construction sites of the canal.

In October 1949, the authorities established a General Directorate to oversee both the works and the penal facilities, answering directly to the national leadership. Its first head was Gheorghe Hossu a former mechanic and tractor driver who had been promoted to the position of first-secretary of the Romanian Worker&#x27;s party in Tulcea County and administrator of the State Fisheries. He was replaced in 1951 by Meyer Grünberg, in turn replaced by Mihail Povstanschi under the name of Vasile Posteucă, who held the position from 1952 to 1953. According to historian Adrian Cioroianu, all three were insufficiently trained for the task they were required to accomplish. By 1952, the Directorate came under the direct supervision of the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the Securitate was allowed direct intervention on the construction site.

On July 18, 1953, the project came to a discreet halt (according to some sources, the closure had been ordered by Stalin himself, as early as 1952). From 1959, part of the works built between 1949 and 1953 was used for the &quot;Mircea Vodă irrigation complex&quot;, later developed into the &quot;Carasu irrigation system&quot;, while another part of the excavations was capitalized during the construction of the northern branch of the canal, 30 years later.

====Forced labor and repression====
Prison camps sprang up all along the projected canal route in the summer of 1949 and were quickly filled with prisoners brought from jails from throughout the country. These first arrivals were soon joined by newly arrested people who were sent to the canal in ever increasing numbers. By 1950 the forced labor camps set up along the length of the planned canal were filled to capacity; that year alone, up to 15,000 prisoners were held in those camps. In 1952, more than 80% of the workforce at the canal consisted of detainees. By 1953, the number of prisoners had swelled to 20,193, or 40,000, or as high as 60,000; other estimates put the number at 40,000 or 100,000 for the entire period. British historian and New York University professor Tony Judt assessed in his book, &quot;Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945&quot;, that, overall, one million Romanians had been imprisoned in various prisons and labor camps, including those on the path of the canal.

The construction effort surpassed the resources available to the Romanian economy in the 1950s. The canal was assigned inferior machinery, part of which had already been used on the Soviet Volga–Don Canal, and building had to rely on primitive techniques (most work appears to have been carried out using shovels and pickaxes, which was especially hard in the rocky terrain of Northern Dobruja). Detainees were allocated to brigades, usually run by common criminals, which were encouraged to use violence against their subordinates. In parallel, the region&#x27;s industrialization, destined to assist in the building effort, was never accomplished.

Sums allocated for prisoners&#x27; health, hygiene and nutrition declined dramatically over the years. Food rations were kept to a minimum, and prisoners would often resort to hunting mice and other small animals, or even consuming grass in an attempt to supplement their diet. 

Starting in summer 1949, the commander of the Canal security troops was lieutenant colonel Augustin Albon. According to the 2006 report of the Tismăneanu Commission, Albon employed torture methods against the detainees, and personally killed many of them. Other security officers who used often cruel and deadly methods with the prisoners were senior lieutenant Liviu Borcea, at the Midia Camp; captain Petre Burghișan, at the Galeș and Peninsula camps; lieutenant Chirion at Peninsula; captain , director of the Securitate&#x27;s Regional Directorate Constanța; and sergeant Grigore Ion Iliescu.

The prisoners were dispossessed farmers who had attempted to resist collectivization, former activists of the National Peasants&#x27; Party, the National Liberal Party, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the fascist Iron Guard, Zionist Jews, as well as Orthodox and Catholic priests. The canal was referred to as the &quot;graveyard of the Romanian bourgeoisie&quot; by the Communist authorities, and the physical elimination of undesirable social classes was one of its most significant goals.

According to Marius Oprea, the death rate among political prisoners at the canal was extremely high; for instance, in the winter of 1951–52, there were one to three detainees dying every day at the Poarta Albă camp, near Galeșu village. The Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania presented an estimate of several thousand deaths among the political prisoners used in the project, significantly higher than 656 officially recorded by an official report from 1968. Journalist Anne Applebaum had previously claimed that over 200,000 had died in its construction, as a result of exposure, unsafe equipment, malnutrition, accidents, tuberculosis and other diseases, over-work, etc., while political analyst Vladimir Socor had estimated the number of deaths to be &quot;considerably in excess of 10,000&quot;. According to Andrei Muraru, a historian and adviser to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, the project became known as &quot;The Death Canal&quot; (&quot;Canalul Morții&quot;). It has also been called &quot;a cesspool of immense human suffering and mortality&quot;. Investigations conducted by the Association of Former Political Prisoners of Romania (AFDPR) Constanța, based on death records from the villages found along the Canal route, indicate 6,355 &quot;Canal workers&quot; (a euphemism for detainees) died during the 1949–1953 period.

In parallel, authorities left aside sectors of employment for skilled workers, kept in strict isolation from all others, they were attracted to the site with exceptional salaries (over 5,000 lei per month), as well as for young people drafted into the Romanian Army and whose files indicated &quot;unhealthy origins&quot; (a middle-class family background). Their numbers fluctuated greatly (regular employees went from 13,200 in 1950 to 15,000 in 1951, to as little as 7,000 in early 1952, and again to 12,500 later in that year). At the same time, facilities meant to accommodate the projected influx of labor (including homes available on credit) were never actually completed. This was overlooked by the propaganda machine, which furnished Stakhanovite stories instead, according to which work quotas were surpassed by as much as 170%. Authorities also claimed the construction site was offering training to previously unskilled workers (as many as 10,000 in one official communiqué).

After the cessation of works, in 1953, the canal camps remained in existence for another year, and their prisoners progressively relocated, to similar conditions at other work sites in Northern Dobruja. Penal facilities on the canal site were shut down in mid-1954.

====Trial====
Blame for the debilitating and unsuccessful works was eventually placed on a group of alleged conspirators, who were indicted in a show trial in late 1952 on trumped-up charges of espionage, fraud, and sabotage. The inquiry was orchestrated by Iosif Chișinevschi.

Three people were executed (the engine driver Nichita Dumitrescu, and the engineers Aurel Rozei-Rozenberg and Nicolae Vasilescu-Colorado); others were imprisoned for various terms. Defendants in a second group, around the engineer Gheorghe Crăciun, were sentenced to various harsh penalties (including three life imprisonments). Torture was applied by a Securitate squad led by Alexandru Nicolschi, as a means to obtain forced confessions.

===Construction (1973–1987)===


In June 1973, the project, with a completely new design, was restarted by Nicolae Ceaușescu, who had previously ordered the rehabilitation of people sentenced in the 1952 trial, and who aimed to withdraw the Lower Danube from Soviet control (which had been established by the 1948 Danube Conference). In official propaganda, where the 1950s precedent was no longer mentioned, the canal was referred to as the Blue Highway (&quot;Magistrala Albastră&quot;).

The general designer of the works of the navigable canal and of the Port of Constanța Sud was the &quot;Design Institute of Road, Water and Air Transport&quot; (IPTANA) from Bucharest, while the &quot;Institute of Hydroelectric Studies and Design&quot; (ISPH) designed the works for the Danube and Cernavodă areas. New and large machinery, produced inside Romania, was introduced to the site. The southern arm was completed in May 1984, with the northern arm being inaugurated in October 1987.

The cost of building the canal is estimated to be around 2 billion dollars, and was supposed to be recovered in 50 years. However, as of 2005, it has an yearly income of only a little over 3 million euros.

In 2018, more than 32.9 million tonnes of cargo were carried over the Danube–Black Sea Canal (an increase of 4.7% compared to the previous year).

==In art==
For much of the 1950s, the Danube–Black Sea Canal was celebrated in agitprop literature (notably, in Geo Bogza&#x27;s 1950 reportage &quot;Începutul epopeii&quot;, &quot;The Beginning of the Epic&quot;, and in Petru Dumitriu&#x27;s &quot;Drum fără pulbere&quot;, &quot;Dustless Road&quot;), music (Leon Klepper&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Dunărea se varsă în mare&quot;, &quot;The Danube Flows to the Sea&quot;), and film (Ion Bostan&#x27;s 1951 &quot;Canalul Dunăre-Marea Neagră, o construcție a păcii&quot; – &quot;The Danube–Black Sea Canal, a Construction of Peace&quot;). During the 1980s, the song &quot;Magistrala Albastră&quot; (&quot;The Blue Freeway&quot;), performed by Dan Spătaru and Mirabela Dauer and using the Canal as its setting, was frequently broadcast in official and semi-official contexts.

During the period of liberalization preceding the &quot;July Theses&quot;, literature was allowed to make several references to the Canal&#x27;s penitentiary history. Examples include Marin Preda&#x27;s &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni&quot; and, most likely, Eugen Barbu&#x27;s &quot;Principele&quot; (by means of an allegory, set during the 18th century Phanariote rules). In 1973–1974, Ion Cârja, a former prisoner, wrote a book titled &quot;Canalul morții&quot; (&quot;The Death Canal&quot;) detailing his sufferings during incarceration; it was first published in Romania in 1993, after the Revolution of 1989. In György Dragomán&#x27;s 2005 novel, &quot;The White King&quot;, set in 1980s Romania, the main protagonist 11-year-old boy&#x27;s father is deported to a labor camp to work on the Danube–Black Sea Canal.

<text>A Matter of Life and Death is a 1946 British fantasy-romance film set in England during World War II.

Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the film stars David Niven, Roger Livesey, Raymond Massey, Kim Hunter and Marius Goring. The film was originally released in the United States under the title Stairway to Heaven, which derived from the film&#x27;s most prominent special effect: a broad escalator linking Earth to the afterlife.

In 1999, &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; placed 20th on the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of Best 100 British films. It ranked 90th in The &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time 2012 poll, regarded by some as the most authoritative in the world, and 78th in 2022.

==Plot==
In 1945, Squadron Leader Peter Carter, a Royal Air Force pilot, is flying a badly damaged and burning Lancaster bomber over the English Channel, after a mission over Germany. Carter is expecting to die, after ordering his crew to bail out, without revealing to them that his own parachute has been destroyed. The only radio operator receiving him is June, at a United States Army Air Forces base on the coast of England. Carter converses with June, before jumping from the Lancaster without a parachute.

Peter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the Other World, misses him in the thick fog over the English Channel. The airman wakes up on a beach near June&#x27;s base. At first, he assumes he is in the afterlife but, when a de Havilland Mosquito flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.

Peter meets June cycling back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a defence counsel from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one.

Peter&#x27;s visions are diagnosed by June&#x27;s fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury—chronic adhesive arachnoiditis from a slight concussion two years earlier—and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves&#x27; death allows him to act as Peter&#x27;s counsel.

Reeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife&#x27;s claim on him. The matter comes to a head—in parallel with Peter&#x27;s brain surgery—before a celestial court; the camera tracks back from an amphitheatre to reveal that it is as large as a spiral galaxy. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a multicultural mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.

Reeves and Farlan both make comparisons with the other&#x27;s nationality to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter&#x27;s open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, &quot;... nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love.&quot;

The jury rules in Peter&#x27;s favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it &quot;very generous&quot;, and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. In the operating room, the masked surgeon (whose face is revealed as that of the Judge) declares the difficult operation a success.

==Cast==
In order of appearance:

Cast notes:

Goring was offered the role of the Conductor, but insisted that he wanted to play Peter instead; however, Powell and Pressburger were set on Niven playing the part, and eventually told Goring that the Conductor was his only choice: if he turned it down, they would approach Peter Ustinov to play the part.

Powell and Pressburger went to Hollywood to cast the role of June with no possible actress in mind except, possibly, Betty Field, who was in a play in New York at the time. The suggestion of Kim Hunter came from Alfred Hitchcock, who had recently used her to read lines from behind the camera for Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s screen test for &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Hunter had stage experience and had been under contract to David O. Selznick for two years. Powell and Pressburger decided that she was right for the part almost immediately on their first meeting, and arranged with Selznick to use her.

Michael Trubshawe was an old drinking buddy of Niven&#x27;s and he was given a cameo in this picture by Niven.

==Production==
&quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; was filmed at D&amp;P Studios and Denham Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England, and on locations in Devon and Surrey. The beach scene was shot at Saunton Sands in Devon, and the village seen in the camera obscura was Shere in Surrey. Production took place from 2 September to 2 December 1945, used 29 sets, and cost an estimated £320,000, equivalent to £ in .

&quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; had an extensive pre-production period due to the complexity of the production: The huge escalator linking this world with the other, called &quot;Operation Ethel&quot; by the firm of engineers who constructed it under the aegis of the London Passenger Transport Board, took three months to make and cost £3,000, . &quot;Ethel&quot; had 106 steps, each wide, and was driven by a 12 hp engine. The full shot was completed by hanging miniatures. It has been claimed that the noise of the machinery prevented recording the soundtrack liveall scenes with the escalator were dubbed in post-production. However, in an interview incorporated into the Carlton DVD release, cinematographer Jack Cardiff recalls his surprise that it operated completely silently.

The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in Three-strip Technicolor, but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black-and-white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as &quot;Colour and Dye-Monochrome Processed in Technicolor&quot;. This reversed the effect in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Photographic dissolves between &quot;Technicolor Dye-Monochrome&quot; (the Other World) and Three-Strip Technicolor (Earth) are used several times during the film. There was a nine-month wait for film stock and Technicolor cameras because they were being used by the US Army to make training films. (As Conductor 71 remarks during an early transition, &quot;One is starved for Technicolor up there.&quot;)

Other sequences also presented challenges, such as the stopped-action table-tennis game for which Hunter and Livesey were trained by champions Alan Brooke and Viktor Barna; the scene where Carter washes up on the beach, the first scene filmed, where cinematographer Jack Cardiff fogged up the camera lens with his breath to create the look he wanted; and the long, 25-minute trial sequence, which required a set with a long by high backcloth.

==Release==
&quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; was chosen for the first ever Royal Film Performance on 1 November 1946 at the Empire Theatre, in London, in the presence of George VI and his wife. The performance was in aid of the Cinematograph Trade Benevolent Fund and £30,000 (£ in pounds) was raised. It then went into general release in the UK on 15 December 1946. The film subsequently had its US release in New York on 25 December 1946 under the name &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.

According to trade papers, the film was a &quot;notable box office attraction&quot; at British cinemas in 1947.

In 1986, the film was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its premiere in New York City, Bosley Crowther said &quot;the delicate charm, the adult humor and visual virtuosity of this Michael Powell—Emeric Pressburger film render it indisputably the best of a batch of Christmas shows...the wit and agility of the producers, who also wrote and directed the job, is given range through the picture in countless delightful ways: in the use, for instance, of Technicolor to photograph the earthly scenes and sepia in which to vision the hygienic regions of the Beyond (so that the heavenly &#x27;messenger&#x27;, descending, is prompted to remark, &#x27;Ah, how one is starved for Technicolor up there!&#x27;.)&quot;

According to a 2006 book, &quot;A spate of movies appeared just after the ending of the Second World War, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (1946), perhaps tapping into so many people&#x27;s experience of loss of loved ones and offering a kind of consolation.&quot;

In December 2017, a digitally restored version was shown in British cinemas. Kevin Maher, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, said the restoration was &quot;crisp&quot; whilst describing the film as being a &quot;definitive fantasy classic&quot; and also as &quot;essential viewing.&quot;

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; in 1999. The film underwent a 4K restoration at Sony Pictures Entertainment for a 2018 Criterion Collection blu-ray release.

==Analysis==

===Title===
According to Powell in his &quot;A Life in Movies&quot;, the United States was the only market in which the film&#x27;s name was changed, except that most European countries used &quot;A &quot;Question&quot; of Life and Death&quot; rather than &quot;A &quot;Matter&quot; of Life and Death&quot;. The American title was the idea of Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin, two lawyers just starting out in the film business, who would be marketing the film in the US, and insisted that no film had ever done well there with the word &quot;death&quot; in the title. When Pressburger countered with the hit film &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;, their response was to point out that it succeeded because the very fact that Death was on holiday meant that there would be no death in the film.

=== Carter&#x27;s visions ===
The film&#x27;s narrative does not clarify whether Carter&#x27;s visions are real, or hallucinatory. The fact that the same actor plays the celestial judge and the brain surgeon tends to indicate that they are a hallucination. To ensure that Carter&#x27;s symptoms – including his visions – were consistent with the diagnosis and treatment depicted, the filmmakers read and integrated a significant amount of medical research, according to Diane Broadbent Friedman.

Interpretations of Carter&#x27;s visions of the &quot;other world&quot; as supernatural, within the context of the film&#x27;s narrative, may be supported by elements of the plot. A key question, which is alluded to in the film&#x27;s dialogue, concerns the unlikelihood of Carter surviving the fall from his aircraft. (Nevertheless, in a small number of historical cases, people have survived falling from a great height, without suffering serious injury or permanent disability.) Likewise, two scenes set in the other world take place without Carter, namely Trubshawe&#x27;s arrival, and the prelude to the start of the trial. A third plot device, regarding a borrowed book, also seems to hint that the other world is real. However, these devices could all be explained as retrospective inventions of Carter&#x27;s mind, while he is unconscious.

===The other world===
The producers took pains never to refer to &quot;the other world&quot; as Heaven, as they felt that was restrictive. However, in the first minutes of the film, a very young Richard Attenborough appears as a dead airman registering in the &quot;other world&quot; and asking: &quot;It&#x27;s heaven, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;, while new arrivals are being measured for angel wings. This is followed by the &quot;other world&quot; female attendant commenting to Flying Officer Trubshawe that some people might think it would be &quot;heaven to be a clerk&quot;. An introductory title screen – repeated as the foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman – contains an explicit statement, however: &quot;This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war&quot;, but goes on to say &quot;Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental&quot;.

The architecture of the other world is noticeably modernist. It features a vast and open plan, with huge circular observation holes, beneath which the clouds of Earth can be seen. This vision was later the inspiration for the design of St. Paul&#x27;s Bus Station, Walsall in 2000, by architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris. The film&#x27;s amphitheatre court scene was rendered by BT in a TV advertisement c. 2002 as a metaphor for communication technology, especially the Internet.

===Identities and significance of the statues===
Lining the escalator are large statues (created by Eric Aumonier) of historically prominent men. A list of the names of the statues appears in Michael Powell&#x27;s handwriting on pages 49 and 50 of the script.

They are:

* Alexander the Great
* Ludwig van Beethoven
* Frédéric Chopin
* Confucius
* Benjamin Franklin
* Julius Caesar

Many of these have in common a characteristic beyond their prominence in politics, art and philosophy: in 1945 most were believed to have had epilepsy – as did John Bunyan, who is seen in the film serving as the conductor for Dr Reeves.

===Anglo-American relations===

The film was originally suggested by a British government department to improve relations between the Americans in the UK and the British public, following Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s contributions to this sphere in &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; two years earlier, though neither film received any government funding nor input on plot or production. There was a degree of public hostility towards American servicemen stationed in the UK prior to the D-Day invasion of Europe. They were viewed by some as latecomers to the war and as &quot;overpaid, oversexed and over here&quot; by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: the British pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry – against the British – is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War. Raymond Massey, portraying an American, was a Canadian national at the time the film was made, but became a naturalised American citizen afterwards.

===Chess===
David Niven was a fan of chess. Peter and June play chess while they await Dr Reeves. Then Conductor 71 &quot;borrows&quot; a chess book Peter has accidentally knocked off the table, Alekhine&#x27;s &quot;My Best Games of Chess 1924–1937&quot;. After the trial is won, Conductor 71 throws the book from the stairway; June finds it in his jacket pocket &quot;to serve the &#x27;was it a hallucination or did it really happen?&#x27; motif of the film&quot;, according to Mig Greengard. He also noted, &quot;Lots of chess in movies past and present, but I can&#x27;t recall another prominent appearance of a real chess book&quot;.

Ian Christie wrote, &quot;the chess plot may also be of more significance than at first appears. The Conductor tries to tempt Peter by offering him the opportunity to pit his skill against the great chess masters, including Philidor; and he &#x27;borrows&#x27; Alekhine&#x27;s famous book, only to return it in an extraordinary transitional shot which introduces the final sequence of Peter waking up in hospital. As a token of Peter&#x27;s life, the book tumbles from one photographic world to another within the same shot&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Radio===
The film was twice adapted for the American CBS Radio series &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, both with the title &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, starring Ray Milland on 27 October 1947 (episode 587) and featuring David Niven on 12 April 1955 (episode 918). The film was also adapted for the American NBC Radio series &quot;Screen Director&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; series as &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, airing on 26 July 1951 and starring Robert Cummings and Julie Adams.

A two-part adaptation by Ben Cottam was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 14 and 21 October 2023. Produced and directed by Simon Barnard, the cast included Will Tudor as Peter, Lydia West as June, Geoffrey McGivern as Reeves, Miles Jupp as Administrator 48 and Jonny Weldon as Bob Trubshawe.

===TV===
An adaptation titled &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; aired as a live performance on the American television show &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; on 9 April 1951 on NBC, starring Richard Greene.

===Theatre===
The film was adapted as the musical &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; at the King&#x27;s Head in Islington in November 1994. It was also made into a play by the Kneehigh Theatre for performances at the National Theatre in London, premiering in May 2007.

==In popular culture==
* A short clip from the film (in which Peter Carter asks June her name) was shown briefly in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics during the &quot;Frankie and June say...thanks Tim&quot; segment (June is named for its protagonist).
* J. K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe, while discussing the near-death or afterlife scenes from &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, said that the film was their favourite and was in mind by both when working on the scenes in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.
* A classic image from the film was included in a 2014 set of postage stamps, &quot;Great British Film&quot;, which honoured the nation&#x27;s most iconic films.
* A sketch in the second series of the comedy sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot; gently lampoons the scenes in which Carter&#x27;s character is conversing with June as his plane is stricken. In the sketch, June has several doomed airmen on the radio trying to get through at once (played by Kevin Eldon and Simon Pegg) and getting their lines crossed with each other.
*The title of &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;, a 2008 British Wallace and Gromit short produced by Aardman Animations, is a pun on the title of the film.
* The ending scene of the 2011 Marvel Comics film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; was inspired by &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;.
* &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; (1991) contains a scene which utilises the original staircase. At the beginning of the sequence when Bill and Ted are addressing God, there are two statues at the base of the staircase. One is of Michael Powell and the other is of David Niven, an homage to &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;.
* The cover art for the international release of Phil Collins&#x27; 1990 single &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot;, features a still from the pivotal operation scene.
* The 2020 Pixar film &quot;Soul&quot; depicts a stairway to the afterlife which is visually similar to the stairway in this film.

<text>Katrina Elizabeth Leskanich ( ; born April 10, 1960) is an American musician and the former lead singer of the British pop rock band Katrina and the Waves. Their song &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; was an international hit in 1985. In 1997, the band won the Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;. Both songs were written by Leskanich&#x27;s long-term bandmate Kimberley Rew.

== Early life ==
Leskanich was born in Topeka, Kansas. Her father was a Vietnam Veteran who became a colonel in the United States Air Force. Katrina and her five siblings (four sisters and one brother) moved frequently as children. The family arrived in the United Kingdom in 1976. She graduated from RAF Lakenheath high school in 1978.

== Early career ==
Mama&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;, a pop cover band from Feltwell, Norfolk, England, was founded in 1978. It featured Leskanich on vocals and keyboards, her then-boyfriend (and fellow American) Vince de la Cruz on vocals and lead guitar, and Marcos de la Cruz on drums. By late 1980, Alex Cooper had joined the band on drums, with Bob Jakins on bass. Mama&#x27;s Cookin&#x27; proceeded to gig steadily in England over the next two years, specializing in covers of songs by American acts.

In 1981, singer-songwriter Kimberley Rew joined Mama&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;, and the five-piece group was quickly renamed The Waves after a band Rew and Cooper had been in together in the mid-1970s. Rew initially fronted the Waves. However, over the first year of the Waves&#x27; existence, Rew began to write material for Leskanich to sing, and she was soon the primary vocalist. The Waves made their initial recorded appearances on a 1982 single (&quot;Nightmare&quot;/&quot;Hey, War Pig!&quot;); both tracks were included on the 1982 Rew solo album called &quot;The Bible of Bop&quot;. The Waves issued their debut EP, &quot;Shock Horror!&quot;, later in 1982. Around this time, bassist Jakins left the band. He was not replaced, as de la Cruz took over on bass, and the band was rechristened Katrina and the Waves.

== Katrina and the Waves ==
=== Early Canadian success (1983–84) ===
In early 1983, the fledgling band recorded—at their own expense—an LP of their original material to sell at gigs. Rew wrote all the songs on this LP, while Leskanich sang eight of the album&#x27;s ten tracks.

The LP was shopped around to various labels, but only Attic Records in Canada responded with an offer. Consequently, although they were based in England, Katrina and The Waves&#x27; first album &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; was released only in Canada.

The album garnered enough critical attention and radio play to merit a Canadian tour. In 1984, the group released a follow-up album in Canada (&quot;Katrina and the Waves 2&quot;), with Leskanich now handling all the lead vocals. The same year, their song &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; was covered by The Bangles, which added to their profile—with the group building a fan base with their recordings and extensive touring, major label interest began to build. Katrina and the Waves signed an international deal with Capitol Records in 1985.

=== &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; and international success (1985–89) ===
The band re-recorded, remixed, or overdubbed 10 songs from their earlier Canadian releases to create their self-titled international debut album in 1985.

The &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; album was a substantial critical and commercial success, and the group had a worldwide hit with the song &quot;Walking on Sunshine,&quot; (No. 9 US, No. 8 UK, a completely re-recorded, and substantially rearranged version of the song compared to its initial 1983 Canada-only release). A Grammy award nomination for &quot;Best New Artist&quot; followed, and a tour, both of which helped to spur sales of new releases. A follow-up single called &quot;Do You Want Crying&quot; (written by de la Cruz) also became a top 40 US hit, reaching No. 37 in the late summer of 1985.

The band&#x27;s follow-up album, entitled &quot;Waves&quot;, did not meet with the same measure of success as the first album. The album did spin off a minor UK and US hit in the form of the Rew-penned &quot;Is That It?&quot; (No. 70 US, No. 82 UK). &quot;Sun Street&quot; (a de la Cruz composition) was a UK Top 30 hit in 1986. However, Capitol dropped the band after the &quot;Waves&quot; album failed to meet expectations. The band subsequently recorded a 1989 album for Capitol-distributed SBK Records called &quot;Break of Hearts&quot;, a harder, more rock-oriented effort than their previous releases. The album included &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot;, which reached No. 16 in the US.

=== Downturn, come back, and breakup (1990–97) ===
Throughout the 1990s, Katrina and the Waves recorded fairly steadily, though most releases were available only in continental Europe and/or Canada. They also recorded the song &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; with Eric Burdon for the TV series &quot;China Beach&quot; in 1990.

On May 3, 1997, after having somewhat faded into obscurity, the band won the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 for the United Kingdom with &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;. Reacting to the win, Leskanich said it was the second landslide victory in a week; the song won by a record points margin, and Tony Blair had won the 1997 British general election two days previously. The song won by a then-record margin of 70 points over the Irish runner-up. The song went to No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart (becoming the band&#x27;s biggest-ever hit) and Katrina and The Waves performed an unprecedented four weeks running on the BBC One TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Katrina and the Waves broke up in 1999.

&quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; has been used in many advertisements and films, including:
* &quot;Ask Max&quot; (1986) Disney movie
* &quot;Secret of My Success&quot; (1987) Michael J Fox – walking on the treadmill
* &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1989) danced to on-screen by John Travolta
* &quot;Bean&quot; (1997)
* &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (2000) danced to by Jack Black
* &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000) with Christian Bale – to tone down a dark event
* &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; (2003) Eddie Murphy – opening sequence
* &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; (2014) Leona Lewis in musical featuring upbeat 1980s songs

Katrina and The Waves&#x27; song covers include:

* Bangles &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot; (1984)
* Dolly Parton &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; on her &quot;Treasures&quot; album (1996)
* Celine Dion &quot;That&#x27;s Just The Woman in Me&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Glee&quot; cast mash up of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; and Beyoncé &quot;Halo&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; has also been featured several times on &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;X Factor&quot; and &quot;The Voice&quot;.

&quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; continues to be one of the most popular songs from the 1980s with over 700 million streams
on Spotify, and over 6 million monthly listeners.

== Solo career ==
After the Waves broke up in 1999, Leskanich launched a solo career. She released her first solo CD, &quot;Katrina Leskanich&quot;, through Universal Records in Britain in 2005.

In February 2005, Leskanich participated in the Melodifestivalen 2005 pre-selection for Sweden&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest entry. She did a duet with the band &#x27;The Nameless&#x27; in the 4th semi final. Their song &#x27;As If Tomorrow Will Never Come&#x27; came 3rd in the semi-final, progressing to the Second Chance round, where they came 6th and did not qualify for the final.

In 2005, Leskanich reflected on sharing her name with a hurricane that devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast in late August and early September of that year, after the name &quot;Katrina and the Waves&quot; appeared on numerous news television shows, headlines, and blog postings that were covering her namesake hurricane. When a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter contacted her about this, she said: &quot;The first time I opened the paper and saw &#x27;Katrina kills 9,&#x27; it was a bit of a shock. ... I hope that the true spirit of &#x27;Walking on Sunshine&#x27; will prevail. I would hate for the title to be tinged with sadness, and I will have to do my part to help turn that around.&quot; She also stated that she hoped that &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot; would become an anthem for the Gulf Coast&#x27;s recovery.

To celebrate the 25th Anniversary of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, Leskanich released her first live album &quot;The Live Album&quot;, in July 2010. The album includes both a live version and a blues version of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;. &quot;I have performed &#x27;Walking on Sunshine&#x27; for so many years in so many different countries that it&#x27;s become the one constant in my life and the one thing I can count on to bring happiness to myself and others&quot; said Leskanich. As part of the 25th Anniversary celebrations, Leskanich also performed &#x27;Walking on Sunshine&#x27; on GMTV.

In September 2010, Leskanich re-released her solo album &quot;Turn The Tide&quot; with two bonus tracks: the club mix of &quot;They Don&#x27;t Know&quot; and the Espirito mix of &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;. In May 2011, Leskanich released an EP entitled &quot;Spiritualize&quot;. &quot;In 1999 I wrote, collected and compiled some songs I thought would come together for an uplifting and spiritual type of album. I thought I&#x27;d try to make this a bit more personal&quot; said Leskanich.

In 2013, Leskanich and her new band performed at festivals in the UK and Europe, including the San Fermín festival in Pamplona in Spain on Plaza del Castillo, and the Steinegg Festival in Italy. In 2014, Leskanich, a firm believer in animal rights, supported &quot;Wildlife Rocks&quot; with an acoustic performance. Other performers included Queen lead guitarist and founder of the Save Me organization, Brian May. The event raised awareness for vital wildlife projects, and was attended by several members of Parliament. The year end saw Leskanich perform on Hubei TV&#x27;s Global New Year Revelry in Beijing 

Leskanich released her second solo album, &quot;Blisland&quot;, which was inspired by the genre of music from her formative years. &quot;I wanted to record an album that reflected my love of all the genres of music I grew up listening to, from &quot;Peter Frampton Live&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) to Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot;. I fell in love with the South West of England; the beautiful beaches reminded me of California, and a little village called Blisland not only had a fantastic little pub but also gave me the perfect name for my new album.&quot;

In the summer of 2014 Leskanich performed at many UK and European festivals including Festival Too in Norfolk, Guilfest in Surrey, Audley End in Essex, Nostalgie Beach Festival in Belgium and the Flashback Festival at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. Leskanich went on to tour North America on the Retro Futura Tour with other 80s artists including Thompson Twins, Tom Bailey, Howard Jones, Midge Ure and China Crisis. In 2015 Leskanich performed at the Lasko Beer and Flowers festival in Slovenia, Rewind North at Capesthorne Hall, Pride Cymru, toured South Africa on the Rewind Tour and toured on her own in North America.

In 2016, Leskanich performed at festivals including We Love the 80s at the Telenor Arena in Oslo, Maspalomas Pride in Gran Canaria, Let&#x27;s Rock the Moor in Cookham, Let&#x27;s Rock Bristol, Let&#x27;s Rock Leeds, and took part in the BBC&#x27;s , toured Australia on the &#x27;Totally 80s&#x27; Tour and toured in Sweden during the summer.

In 2017 Leskanich performed at various festivals including the Lotos 2017 Music Festival in Boca Raton, Florida with other 80s and 90s artists including Boy George and Ace of Base, Let&#x27;s Rock Exeter, Let&#x27;s Rock London, Let&#x27;s Rock Southampton, Bristol Pride, and Manchester Pride. Leskanich toured the US with the Retro Futura Tour 2017 with 80s artists including Howard Jones, Paul Young, The English Beat and Modern English and in May 2017 released her first compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Katrina&quot;. In 2018 Leskanich released her first Christmas single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love&quot;. Leskanich also performed at Let&#x27;s Rock Xmas at the SSE Wembley Arena and for the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need Rocks the 80s charity fundraiser also at the SSE Wembley Arena.

In 2018 Leskanich performed on the 80&#x27;s Cruise with 80s artists including Billy Ocean and Rick Springfield and at various festivals in the UK and Europe including Let&#x27;s Rock Norwich, Let&#x27;s Rock Scotland, Let&#x27;s Rock Shrewsbury, Irlam Live in Manchester, W-Fest in Kluisbergen, Belgium.

2019 saw Leskanich performing at festivals around Europe including Yo Fui a EGB at Palau St Jordi in Barcelona, Donauinselfest in Vienna, Austria, Roze Zaterdag (Venlo Pride) in Venlo, Netherlands, Forever Young festival, Dublin, Ireland, Hestholmen Retrofestival in Norway, Skeikampenfestivalen, Gausdal in Norway, Top of the Top Sopot festival in Gdansk, Poland, and Gottschalks 80s TV show in Hanover, Germany.

In 2020, Leskanich was invited back to perform at Yo Fui a EGB at the Wizink Centre in Madrid and to the 80s Cruise where she was joined by other 80s artists including The B-52&#x27;s and Berlin (band).

The Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore the EBU decided to organize as an alternative. The name was inspired by the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; by Katrina and the Waves which won the Eurovision Song Contest 1997. Closing the show, most of the artists performed &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; from their respective home countries with Leskanich singing the last line.

In July 2020, Leskanich released the single &quot;Drive&quot; which garnered many plays on BBC Radio 2 and BBC local radio stations. This was followed by the release of her album, &quot;Hearts, Loves &amp; Babys&quot; and a second single, &quot;I Want to Love Again&quot;.

Covid-19 put an end to any further touring until the summer of 2021 when Leskanich performed at Rewind North, Rewind South, Back to the 80s 90s festival in Leicestershire and Feile an Phobail in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

In 2022 Leskanich performed at various festivals in the UK and Europe, including the Upton House Concerts in Poole, Fest i Vest in Stord, Norway, Bristol Pride, Ravnedalen Live in Kristiansand, Norway, Here and Now at Tamworth Castle, Night of the Proms in Koksijde, Belgium, City of Guitars in Locarno, Switzerland and Arena Suzuki in Verona in Italy.

Plus shows in the Faeroe Islands, Belgium, Norway, Estonia, Europride in Malta, 80s in the Sand in Cancun and The Greatest 80s tour of Sweden in November and December. 

Leskanich released a new single, &#x27;Shut Your Mouth&#x27; on 21 April 2023.

In 2024 Leskanich performed at Rewind Scotland in Perth, Rewind North in Macclesfield and Rewind South in Henley-on-Thames. And performed at UK festivals and Prides including AppFest, Boogietown, Liverpool Pride and the ABBA Eurovision celebration at Brighton Dome. In April Leskanich released a cover of Petula Clark&#x27;s &#x27;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&#x27; written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent which was Number One in the Heritage Chart in June. This was followed by a re-release of &#x27;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love&#x27; which reached Number 2 in the Heritage Chart in January 2025.

<text>Galactokinase is an enzyme (phosphotransferase) that facilitates the phosphorylation of α-D-galactose to galactose 1-phosphate at the expense of one molecule of ATP. Galactokinase catalyzes the second step of the Leloir pathway, a metabolic pathway found in most organisms for the catabolism of α-D-galactose to glucose 1-phosphate. First isolated from mammalian liver, galactokinase has been studied extensively in yeast, archaea, plants, and humans.

==Structure==

Galactokinase is composed of two domains separated by a large cleft. The two regions are known as the N- and C-terminal domains, and the adenine ring of ATP binds in a hydrophobic pocket located at their interface. The N-terminal domain is marked by five strands of mixed beta-sheet and five alpha-helices, and the C-terminal domain is characterized by two layers of anti-parallel beta-sheets and six alpha-helices. Galactokinase does not belong to the sugar kinase family, but rather to a class of ATP-dependent enzymes known as the GHMP superfamily. GHMP is an abbreviation referring to its original members: galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase. Members of the GHMP superfamily have great three-dimensional similarity despite only ten to 20% sequence identity. These enzymes contain three well-conserved motifs (I, II, and III), the second of which is involved in nucleotide binding and has the sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala.

===Sugar specificity===
Galactokinases across different species display a great diversity of substrate specificities. &quot;E. coli&quot; galactokinase can also phosphorylate 2-deoxy-D-galactose, 2-amino-deoxy-D-galactose, 3-deoxy-D-galactose and D-fucose. The enzyme cannot tolerate any C-4 modifications, but changes at the C-2 position of D-galactose do not interfere with enzyme function. Both human and rat galactokinases are also able to successfully phosphorylate 2-deoxy-D-galactose. Galactokinase from &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, on the other hand, is highly specific for D-galactose and cannot phosphorylate glucose, mannose, arabinose, fucose, lactose, galactitol, or 2-deoxy-D-galactose. Moreover, the kinetic properties of galactokinase also differ across species. The sugar specificity of galactokinases from different sources has been dramatically expanded through directed evolution and structure-based protein engineering. The corresponding broadly permissive sugar anomeric kinases serve as a cornerstone for &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; glycorandomization.

==Mechanism==

Recently, the roles of active site residues in human galactokinase have become understood. Asp-186 abstracts a proton from C1-OH of α-D-galactose, and the resulting alkoxide nucleophile attacks the γ-phosphorus of ATP. A phosphate group is transferred to the sugar, and Asp-186 may be deprotonated by water. Nearby Arg-37 stabilizes Asp-186 in its anionic form and has also been proven to be essential to galactokinase function in point mutation experiments. Both the aspartic acid and arginine active site residues are highly conserved among galactokinases. 

==Biological function==

The Leloir pathway catalyzes the conversion of galactose to glucose. Galactose is found in dairy products, as well as in fruits and vegetables, and can be produced endogenously in the breakdown of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Three enzymes are required in the Leloir pathway: galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. Galactokinase catalyzes the first committed step of galactose catabolism, forming galactose 1-phosphate.

==Disease relevance==

Galactosemia, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by decreased ability to metabolize galactose, can be caused by a mutation in any of the three enzymes in the Leloir pathway. Galactokinase deficiency, also known as galactosemia type II, is a recessive metabolic disorder caused by a mutation in human galactokinase. About 20 mutations have been identified that cause galactosemia type II, the main symptom of which is early onset cataracts. In lens cells of the human eye, aldose reductase converts galactose to galactitol. As galactose is not being catabolized to glucose due to a galactokinase mutation, galactitol accumulates. This galactitol gradient across the lens cell membrane triggers the osmotic uptake of water, and the swelling and eventual apoptosis of lens cells ensues.

<text>In molecular biology, phosphotransferases are proteins in the transferase family of enzymes (EC number 2.7) that catalyze certain chemical reactions. The general form of the phosphorylation reactions they catalyze is:

formula_1

Where P is a phosphate group and A and B are the donating and accepting molecules, respectively.

==Classification==
Phosphotransferases are generally classified according to the acceptor molecule.
*EC 2.7.1 Phosphotransferases with an alcohol group as acceptor
*EC 2.7.2 Phosphotransferases with a carboxy group as acceptor
*EC 2.7.3 Phosphotransferases with a nitrogenous group as acceptor
*EC 2.7.4 Phosphotransferases with a phosphate group as acceptor
*EC 2.7.9 Phosphotransferases with paired acceptors. In these reactions, a single triphosphate-nucleotide transfers two phosphates to two different acceptor molecules, resulting in a monophosphate-nucleotide and two phosphorylated products.

==Phosphotransferase system==
The phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a complex group translocation system present in many bacteria. The PTS transports sugars (such as glucose, mannose, and mannitol) into the cell. The first step of this reaction is phosphorylation of the substrate via phosphotransferase during transport. In the case of glucose, the product of this phosphorylation is glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P).
Due to the negative charge of the phosphate, this Glc-6P can no longer freely leave the cell. This is the first reaction of glycolysis, which degrades the sugar to pyruvate.

<text>John Donovan Cannon (April 24, 1922 – May 20, 2005) was an American actor. An alumnus of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, he is best known for his co-starring role of Chief of Detectives Peter B. Clifford in the television series &quot;McCloud&quot; with Dennis Weaver from 1970 until 1977, and for his part as the witness Lloyd Chandler who cleared Dr. Richard Kimble (David Janssen) in &quot;The Judgment&quot;, the series finale of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Films and television===

Cannon served in the United States Army during World War II. Cannon first appeared on television as Master Sergeant Sherman in the sitcom &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, also known as &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot;.

He appeared in a 1963 episode of &quot;Combat!&quot;, titled &quot;The Quiet Warrior&quot;, as a member of the American Intelligence.

In 1964, he appeared in the TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, as the evil killer “Pike Beecham” in the episode “Big Man, Big Target” (S10E10).

In 1965, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. The episode, titled “Completely Foolproof”, originally aired March 29, 1965.

In 1970 Cannon appeared as Roy Harkness on &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot;, the retitled name for the final season of TV western &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Hannah&quot;. He played a recurring character – a lawman named Harry Briscoe working for the Bannerman Detective Agency - in the 1971 to 1973 series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;. He guest-starred in many series over the years, including &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Lancer&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;Testimony of Two Men&quot; (1977) and &quot;Top of the Hill&quot; (1980). He was cast in several episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. His last television acting appearance was on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 1991.

He wore a toupee in most of his later roles. The exception was the &quot;Remington Steele&quot; episode &quot;Steele in the News&quot; (4 March 1983), in which Cannon played a TV news anchor who only wore his toupee while broadcasting. He also appeared (with his toupee), that same season (#2), of &quot;Remington Steele&quot; in episode 21 &quot;Hounded Steele&quot;. In the second season of &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1965–1966), he played Brig. Gen. Dave Creighton in the 34th episode of the series &quot;RX for a Sick Bird&quot;.

Cannon appeared in film roles, often as a cold-eyed villain. His film credits included &quot;An American Dream&quot; (1966), &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot; (1969), &quot;The Thousand Plane Raid&quot; (1969), &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot; (1969), &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; (1970), &quot;Lawman&quot; (1971), &quot;Scorpio&quot; (1973), &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; (1980), &quot;Death Wish II&quot; (1982) and &quot;Beyond Witch Mountain&quot; (1982).

===Stage===
Cannon was a founding member of Joseph Papp&#x27;s New York Shakespeare Festival, starring in their productions of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1956) and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1961).

He starred with James Earl Jones in the original off-Broadway production of Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Blood Knot&quot; (1964).

===Other Appearances===
In 1979, Cannon was the presenter in an instructional video demonstrating an MCA DiscoVision video disc player.

In 2019, Anders Enger Jenson sampled the original instruction video into his music track.

==Personal life==
Cannon married Alice McCamley, an actress and writer who appeared in Broadway productions including &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot;. In 1962, he and Colleen Dewhurst starred in his wife&#x27;s play &quot;Great Day in the Morning&quot;, based on her childhood in St. Louis.

Cannon died at his home in Hudson, New York, on May 20, 2005, at the age of 83. Alice suffered a debilitating stroke in 2014 and died in 2017.

<text>The Lane Transit District (LTD) is a public agency that provides public transportation in Lane County, Oregon, United States. The transit district serves the Eugene and Springfield metropolitan areas, including the neighboring cities of Coburg, Junction City, Creswell, Cottage Grove, Veneta, and Lowell. LTD began service in 1970 with 18 buses and two vans, and today carries roughly 10.5 million customers annually with a fleet of 111 buses. Many of LTD&#x27;s riders are students; University of Oregon and Lane Community College students ride by simply showing their student I.D. Student fees subsidize both programs, as well as limited late-night service until about 1 a.m. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

A board of directors, whose members are appointed by the Governor of Oregon, governs LTD. A combination of passenger fares, payroll taxes, and state and federal money fund the system.

According to LTD&#x27;s Website, LTD operates 111 buses, which includes both standard and low-floor buses, in length of 30-foot, 40-foot, and 60-foot (articulated buses) for regular services. Among those 111 vehicles, 11 of those are the 60-foot BRT vehicles used for EmX service. All LTD buses are wheelchair-accessible, since 1985. The district currently operates 45 hybrid-electric buses, and 11 electric buses.

== Climate Policy and Fleet Electrification ==

In March 2020, LTD passed its first-ever board-level climate policy, with a commitment to reduce emissions from the fleet by 75% by 2030 and by 100% by 2035. Additionally, the policy calls for working with local jurisdictions to create joint goals related to the intersection of transportation and land use.

The agency took delivery of the first of eleven electric buses from New Flyer in December 2020, with the remainder scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2021.

== EmX (Bus Rapid Transit in Eugene) ==

In addition to the fixed bus routes, LTD operates a bus rapid transit line from downtown Eugene to the Gateway area in north Springfield, via downtown Springfield. The BRT line, named the Emerald Express (EmX), began operations in January 2007. This is Oregon&#x27;s first Bus Rapid Transit line. The first corridor connects downtown Eugene to downtown Springfield and runs primarily along Franklin Boulevard. A second EmX corridor, the Gateway EmX extension, began service in January 2011. The Gateway EmX extension connects downtown Springfield and the Gateway area in north Springfield. LTD chose bus rapid transit after a review process during which several transportation options, including light rail, were considered. It concluded that this was the best option for Eugene-Springfield&#x27;s size and current transportation needs.

The West Eugene Extension is a 17-station extension of the existing EmX service west from its existing terminus at Eugene Station in downtown Eugene. The extension opened on September 17, 2017. The addition added 4.4 miles to EmX&#x27;s current line, while also adding a new bike lane, two new bike and pedestrian bridges, and 4.7 miles of new, wider sidewalks installed along West 6th, 7th, and 11th Avenues.

Future EmX line extensions to the Thurston neighborhood, Lane Community College, and LTD&#x27;s River Road station are currently under consideration.

<text>Red Heart was a joint venture between the Seven Network and Granada PLC between c. 1999 and 2001. It brought together all of its Australian parents&#x27; TV production resources, except those used for Seven&#x27;s news and soaps.

One theory states that Granada was looking to buy Seven&#x27;s core, through it eventually owning 100% of Red Heart. Red Heart may have also eventually controlled Seven&#x27;s news and soaps. This was a time when &quot;content is king&quot; was a popular idea.

Australia&#x27;s Broadcasting Services Act 1992 disallows foreign entities owning more than 15% of any TV station licence holder, but owning a company that provides a station with 100% of its content for 99% of its income is fine. (CanWest found another way around the law to own a majority stake of Network Ten).

However, Granada decided to pull out of Red Heart when it realised it could make more money selling Australian programs to other Australian broadcasters than it would just supplying Seven. It has been rare to see Australian-made Granada programs on the screen.

<text>Platybelodon (&quot;shovel tooth&quot;) is an extinct genus of large herbivorous proboscidean mammals related to modern-day elephants, placed in the &quot;shovel tusker&quot; family Amebelodontidae. Species lived during the middle Miocene Epoch in Africa, Asia and the Caucasus.

== History of discovery ==

=== Early years ===
In the summer of 1927, the remains of a proboscidean were recovered from the Miocene-age Tchokrak beds of the Kuban region (north Caucasus). The remains recovered were fragmentary, consisting of a partial skull and a nearly complete mandible (lower jaw) in one specimen, and a few disarticulated teeth and bones of others. On April 4, 1928, Russian palaeontologist Alexey Borissiak briefly described the remains, assigning to them the binomial name &quot;Platybelodon danovi&quot;. The etymology of the name is obscure, though it may translate to &quot;shovel tooth&quot;, &quot;broad tooth&quot;, or &quot;plate tooth&quot;. A year after his initial description, Borissiak, he published a more detailed diagnosis of the relevant specimens. Borissiak believed that &quot;P. danovi&quot;, represented a new branch of mastodont taxonomy, though did not provide a name.

On July 28, 1928, during the Central Asiatic Expeditions to Mongolia, Roy Chapman Andrews and Walter W. Granger came upon a series of mandibles and teeth in the Tung Gur locality. The following year, Henry Fairfield Osborn assigned them to &quot;Platybelodon&quot;, assigning to them the name &quot;Platybelodon grangeri&quot;, after Granger. AMNH 26202, the partial mandible of an adult, was designated as the type specimen.&quot;&quot;

== Distribution ==
&quot;P. grangeri&quot; fossils are known from China.

==Palaeobiology==
&quot;Platybelodon&quot; was previously believed to have fed in the swampy areas of grassy savannas, using its teeth to shovel up aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation. However, wear patterns on the teeth suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip bark from trees, and may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the &quot;shovel&quot; more like a modern-day scythe, grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree. Adults in particular might have eaten coarser vegetation more frequently than juveniles.

<text>The nucleus accumbens (NAc or NAcc; also known as the accumbens nucleus, or formerly as the nucleus accumbens septi, Latin for &#x27;nucleus adjacent to the septum&#x27;) is a region in the basal forebrain rostral to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle collectively form the ventral striatum. The ventral striatum and dorsal striatum collectively form the striatum, which is the main component of the basal ganglia. The dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic pathway project onto the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. Each cerebral hemisphere has its own nucleus accumbens, which can be divided into two structures: the nucleus accumbens core and the nucleus accumbens shell. These substructures have different morphology and functions.

Different NAcc subregions (core vs shell) and neuron subpopulations within each region (D1-type vs D2-type medium spiny neurons) are responsible for different cognitive functions. As a whole, the nucleus accumbens has a significant role in the cognitive processing of motivation, aversion, reward (i.e., incentive salience, pleasure, and positive reinforcement), and reinforcement learning (e.g., Pavlovian-instrumental transfer); hence, it has a significant role in addiction. In addition, part of the nucleus accumbens core is centrally involved in the induction of slow-wave sleep. The nucleus accumbens plays a lesser role in processing fear (a form of aversion), impulsivity, and the placebo effect. It is involved in the encoding of new motor programs as well.

== Structure ==
The nucleus accumbens is an aggregate of neurons which is described as having an outer shell and an inner core.

===Input===
Major glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens include the prefrontal cortex (particularly the prelimbic cortex and infralimbic cortex), basolateral amygdala, ventral hippocampus, thalamic nuclei (specifically the midline thalamic nuclei and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus), and glutamatergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The nucleus accumbens receives dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area, which connect via the mesolimbic pathway. The nucleus accumbens is often described as one part of a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.

Dopaminergic inputs from the VTA modulate the activity of GABAergic neurons within the nucleus accumbens. These neurons are activated directly or indirectly by euphoriant drugs (e.g., amphetamine, opiates, etc.) and by participating in rewarding experiences (e.g., sex, music, exercise, etc.).

Another major source of input comes from the CA1 and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus to the dorsomedial area of the nucleus accumbens. Slight depolarizations of cells in the nucleus accumbens correlates with positivity of the neurons of the hippocampus, making them more excitable. The correlated cells of these excited states of the medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens are shared equally between the subiculum and CA1. The subiculum neurons are found to hyperpolarize (increase negativity) while the CA1 neurons &quot;ripple&quot; (fire &gt; 50 Hz) in order to accomplish this priming.

The nucleus accumbens is one of the few regions that receives a high density of histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus (the sole source of histamine neurons in the brain).

===Output===
The output neurons of the nucleus accumbens send axonal projections to the basal ganglia and the ventral analog of the globus pallidus, known as the ventral pallidum (VP). The VP, in turn, projects to the medial dorsal nucleus of the dorsal thalamus, which projects to the prefrontal cortex as well as back to the ventral and to dorsal striatum. Other efferents from the nucleus accumbens include connections with the tail of the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, and the reticular formation of the pons.

===Shell===
The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcc shell) is a substructure of the nucleus accumbens. The shell and core together form the entire nucleus accumbens.

Location: The shell is the outer region of the nucleus accumbens, and – unlike the core – is considered to be part of the extended amygdala, located at its rostral pole.

Cell types: Neurons in the nucleus accumbens are mostly medium spiny neurons (MSNs) containing mainly D1-type (i.e., DRD1 and DRD5) or D2-type (i.e., DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) dopamine receptors. A subpopulation of MSNs contain both D1-type and D2-type receptors, with approximately 40% of striatal MSNs expressing both DRD1 and DRD2 mRNA. These mixed-type NAcc MSNs with both D1-type and D2-type receptors are mostly confined to the NAcc shell. The neurons in the shell, as compared to the core, have a lower density of dendritic spines, less terminal segments, and less branch segments than those in the core. The shell neurons project to the subcommissural part of the ventral pallidum as well as the ventral tegmental area and to extensive areas in the hypothalamus and extended amygdala.

Function: The shell of the nucleus accumbens is involved in the cognitive processing of reward, including subjective &quot;liking&quot; reactions to certain pleasurable stimuli, motivational salience, and positive reinforcement. That NAcc shell has also been shown to mediate specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, a phenomenon in which a classically conditioned stimulus modifies operant behavior. A &quot;hedonic hotspot&quot; or pleasure center which is responsible for the pleasurable or &quot;liking&quot; component of some intrinsic rewards is also located in a small compartment within the medial NAcc shell. Addictive drugs have a larger effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core.

===Core===
The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc core) is the inner substructure of the nucleus accumbens.

Location: The nucleus accumbens core is part of the ventral striatum, located within the basal ganglia.
Cell types: The core of the NAcc is made up mainly of medium spiny neurons containing mainly D1-type or D2-type dopamine receptors. The D1-type medium spiny neurons mediate reward-related cognitive processes, whereas the D2-type medium spiny neurons mediate aversion-related cognition. The neurons in the core, as compared to the neurons in the shell, have an increased density of dendritic spines, branch segments, and terminal segments. From the core, the neurons project to other sub-cortical areas such as the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. GABA is one of the main neurotransmitters in the NAcc, and GABA receptors are also abundant.

Function: The nucleus accumbens core is involved in the cognitive processing of motor function related to reward and reinforcement and the regulation of slow-wave sleep. Specifically, the core encodes new motor programs which facilitate the acquisition of a given reward in the future. The indirect pathway (i.e., D2-type) neurons in the NAcc core which co-express adenosine A2A receptors activation-dependently promote slow-wave sleep. The NAcc core has also been shown to mediate general Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, a phenomenon in which a classically conditioned stimulus modifies operant behavior.

==Cell types==
Approximately 95% of neurons in the NAcc are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which primarily express either D1-type or D2-type receptors; about 1–2% of the remaining neuronal types are large aspiny cholinergic interneurons and another 1–2% are GABAergic interneurons.
Compared to the GABAergic MSNs in the shell, those in the core have an increased density of dendritic spines, branch segments, and terminal segments. From the core, the neurons project to other sub-cortical areas such as the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. GABA is one of the main neurotransmitters in the NAcc, and GABA receptors are also abundant. These neurons are also the main projection or output neurons of the nucleus accumbens.

==Neurochemistry==
Some of the neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones that signal through receptors within the nucleus accumbens include:

Dopamine: Dopamine is released into the nucleus accumbens following exposure to rewarding stimuli, including recreational drugs like substituted amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine and morphine.

Phenethylamine and tyramine: Phenethylamine and tyramine are trace amines which are synthesized in neurons that express the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (AADC) enzyme, which includes all dopaminergic neurons. Both compounds function as dopaminergic neuromodulators which regulate the reuptake and release of dopamine into the Nacc via interactions with VMAT2 and TAAR1 in the axon terminal of mesolimbic dopamine neurons.

Glucocorticoids and dopamine: Glucocorticoid receptors are the only corticosteroid receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell. L-DOPA, steroids, and specifically glucocorticoids are currently known to be the only known endogenous compounds that can induce psychotic problems, so understanding the hormonal control over dopaminergic projections with regard to glucocorticoid receptors could lead to new treatments for psychotic symptoms. A recent study demonstrated that suppression of the glucocorticoid receptors led to a decrease in the release of dopamine, which may lead to future research involving anti-glucocorticoid drugs to potentially relieve psychotic symptoms.

GABA: A recent study on rats that used GABA agonists and antagonists indicated that GABAA receptors in the NAcc shell have inhibitory control on turning behavior influenced by dopamine, and GABAB receptors have inhibitory control over turning behavior mediated by acetylcholine.

Glutamate: Studies have shown that local blockade of glutamatergic NMDA receptors in the NAcc core impaired spatial learning. Another study demonstrated that both NMDA and AMPA (both glutamate receptors) play important roles in regulating instrumental learning.

Serotonin (5-HT): Overall, 5-HT synapses are more abundant and have a greater number of synaptic contacts in the NAcc shell than in the core. They are also larger and thicker, and contain more large dense core vesicles than their counterparts in the core.

== Function ==
===Reward and reinforcement===
The nucleus accumbens, being one part of the reward system, plays an important role in processing rewarding stimuli, reinforcing stimuli (e.g., food and water), and those which are both rewarding and reinforcing (addictive drugs, sex, and exercise). The predominant response of neurons in the nucleus accumbens to the reward sucrose is inhibition; the opposite is true in response to the administration of aversive quinine. Substantial evidence from pharmacological manipulation also suggests that reducing the excitability of neurons in the nucleus accumbens is rewarding, as, for example, would be true in the case of μ-opioid receptor stimulation. The blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD) in the nucleus accumbens is selectively increased during the perception of pleasant, emotionally arousing pictures and during mental imagery of pleasant, emotional scenes. However, as BOLD is thought to be an indirect measure of regional net excitation to inhibition, the extent to which BOLD measures valence dependent processing is unknown. Because of the abundance of NAcc inputs from limbic regions and strong NAcc outputs to motor regions, the nucleus accumbens has been described by Gordon Mogensen as the interface between the limbic and motor system.

The nucleus accumbens is causally related to the experience of pleasure. Microinjections of μ-opioid agonists, δ-opioid agonists or κ-opioid agonists in the rostrodorsal quadrant of the medial shell enhance &quot;liking&quot;, while more caudal injections can inhibit disgust reactions, liking reactions, or both. The regions of the nucleus accumbens that can be ascribed a causal role in the production of pleasure are limited both anatomically and chemically, as besides opioid agonists only endocannabinoids can enhance liking. In the nucleus accumbens as a whole, dopamine, GABA receptor agonist or AMPA antagonists solely modify motivation, while the same is true for opioid and endocannabinoids outside of the hotspot in the medial shell. A rostro-caudal gradient exists for the enhancement of appetitive versus fearful responses, the latter of which is traditionally thought to require only D1 receptor function, and the former of which requires both D1 and D2 function. One interpretation of this finding, the disinhibition hypothesis, posits that inhibition of accumbens MSNs (which are GABAergic) disinhibits downstream structures, enabling the expression of appetitive or consummatory behaviors. The motivational effects of AMPA antagonists, and to a lesser extent GABA agonists, is anatomically flexible. Stressful conditions can expand the fear inducing regions, while a familiar environment can reduce the size of the fear inducing region. Furthermore, cortical input from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) biases the response towards that of appetitive behavior, and infralimbic input, equivalent to the human subgenual cingulate cortex, suppresses the response regardless of valence.

The nucleus accumbens is neither necessary nor sufficient for instrumental learning, although manipulations can affect performance on instrumental learning tasks. One task where the effect of NAcc lesions is evident is Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT), where a cue paired with a specific or general reward can enhance instrumental responding. Lesions to the core of the NAcc impair performance after devaluation and inhibit the effect of general PIT. On the other hand, lesions to the shell only impair the effect of specific PIT. This distinction is thought to reflect consummatory and appetitive conditioned responses in the NAcc shell and the NAcc core, respectively.

In the dorsal striatum, a dichotomy has been observed between D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs, with the former being reinforcing and enhancing locomotion, and the latter being aversive and reducing locomotion. Such a distinction has been traditionally assumed to apply to the nucleus accumbens as well, but evidence from pharmacological and optogenetics studies is conflicting. Furthermore, a subset of NAcc MSNs express both D1 and D2 MSNs, and pharmacological activation of D1 versus D2 receptors need not necessarily activate the neural populations exactly. While most studies show no effect of selective optogenetic stimulation of D1 or D2 MSNs on locomotor activity, one study has reported a decrease in basal locomotion with D2-MSN stimulation. While two studies have reported reduced reinforcing effects of cocaine with D2-MSN activation, one study has reported no effect. NAcc D2-MSN activation has also been reported to enhance motivation, as assessed by PIT, and D2 receptor activity is necessary for the reinforcing effects of VTA stimulation. A 2018 study reported that D2 MSN activation enhanced motivation via inhibiting the ventral pallidum, thereby disinhibiting the VTA.

====Maternal behavior====
An fMRI study conducted in 2005 found that when mother rats were in the presence of their pups the regions of the brain involved in reinforcement, including the nucleus accumbens, were highly active. Levels of dopamine increase in the nucleus accumbens during maternal behavior, while lesions in this area upset maternal behavior. When women are presented pictures of unrelated infants, fMRIs show increased brain activity in the nucleus accumbens and adjacent caudate nucleus, proportionate to the degree to which the women find these infants &quot;cute&quot;.

===Aversion===
Activation of D1-type MSNs in the nucleus accumbens is involved in reward, whereas the activation of D2-type MSNs in the nucleus accumbens promotes aversion.

===Slow-wave sleep===

In late 2017, studies on rodents which utilized optogenetic and chemogenetic methods found that the indirect pathway (i.e., D2-type) medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens core which co-express adenosine A2A receptors and project to the ventral pallidum are involved in the regulation of slow-wave sleep. In particular, optogenetic activation of these indirect pathway NAcc core neurons induces slow-wave sleep and chemogenetic activation of the same neurons increases the number and duration of slow-wave sleep episodes. Chemogenetic inhibition of these NAcc core neurons suppresses sleep. In contrast, the D2-type medium spiny neurons in the NAcc shell which express adenosine A2A receptors have no role in regulating slow-wave sleep.

==Clinical significance==
===Addiction===
Current models of addiction from chronic drug use involve alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection. The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are ΔFosB, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). ΔFosB is the most significant gene transcription factor in addiction since its viral or genetic overexpression in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and behavioral effects (e.g., expression-dependent increases in self-administration and reward sensitization) seen in drug addiction. ΔFosB overexpression has been implicated in addictions to alcohol (ethanol), cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and substituted amphetamines, among others. Increases in nucleus accumbens ΔJunD expression can reduce or, with a large increase, even block most of the neural alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).

ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state through ΔFosB overexpression. Consequently, ΔFosB is the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards as well; in particular, ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward. Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that psychostimulants and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess cross-sensitization effects that are mediated through ΔFosB.

Similar to drug rewards, non-drug rewards also increase the level of extracellular dopamine in the NAcc shell. Drug-induced dopamine release in the NAcc shell and NAcc core is usually not prone to habituation (i.e., the development of drug tolerance: a decrease in dopamine release from future drug exposure as a result of repeated drug exposure); on the contrary, repeated exposure to drugs that induce dopamine release in the NAcc shell and core typically results in sensitization (i.e., the amount of dopamine that is released in the NAcc from future drug exposure increases as a result of repeated drug exposure). Sensitization of dopamine release in the NAcc shell following repeated drug exposure serves to strengthen stimulus-drug associations (i.e., classical conditioning that occurs when drug use is repeatedly paired with environmental stimuli) and these associations become less prone to extinction (i.e., &quot;unlearning&quot; these classically conditioned associations between drug use and environmental stimuli becomes more difficult). After repeated pairing, these classically conditioned environmental stimuli (e.g., contexts and objects that are frequently paired with drug use) often become drug cues which function as secondary reinforcers of drug use (i.e., once these associations are established, exposure to a paired environmental stimulus triggers a craving or desire to use the drug which they&#x27;ve become associated with).

In contrast to drugs, the release of dopamine in the NAcc shell by many types of rewarding non-drug stimuli typically undergoes habituation following repeated exposure (i.e., the amount of dopamine that is released from future exposure to a rewarding non-drug stimulus normally decreases as a result of repeated exposure to that stimulus).

===Depression===
In April 2007, two research teams reported on having inserted electrodes into the nucleus accumbens in order to use deep brain stimulation to treat severe depression. In 2010, experiments reported that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens was successful in decreasing depression symptoms in 50% of patients who did not respond to other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy. Nucleus accumbens has also been used as a target to treat small groups of patients with therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.

===Ablation===
To treat addiction and in an attempt to treat mental illness radiofrequency ablation of the nucleus accumbens has been performed. The results are inconclusive and controversial.

===Placebo effect===
Activation of the NAcc has been shown to occur in the anticipation of effectiveness of a drug when a user is given a placebo, indicating a contributing role of the nucleus accumbens in the placebo effect.

<text>Amebelodon is a genus of extinct proboscidean belonging to Amebelodontidae (the so-called shovel-tuskers). The most striking attribute of this animal is its lower tusks, which are narrow, elongated, and distinctly flattened with the degree of flattening varying among the different species. One valid species is known for this genus, which was endemic to North America. Other species once assigned to &quot;Amebelodon&quot; are now assigned to the genus &quot;Konobelodon&quot;, which was once a subgenus.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Amebelodon&quot; first appeared in the Great Plains and Gulf Coast regions of North America during the late Miocene, roughly 9 million years ago, and apparently became extinct on this continent sometime around 6 million years ago. The youngest record of &quot;Amebelodon&quot; is from a 5-million-year-old site in North America. The species &quot;Amebelodon floridanus&quot; was relatively small, a little smaller than living elephants, and was common in fossil sites from 9 to 8 million years ago. Other larger but somewhat younger common North American species include &quot;Amebelodon fricki&quot;. One lineage of species once assigned to &quot;Amebelodon&quot;, including &quot;Amebelodon britti&quot; and North African &quot;Amebelodon cyrenaicus&quot;, is now placed in a separate genus called &quot;Konobelodon&quot;, formerly considered to be a subgenus.

==Paleobiology==
Like other typical gomphotheres, &quot;Amebelodon&quot; possessed two sets of tusks, one upper set, (much like those found on modern elephants), and one lower set that extended from the very front of the lower jaws. However, as mentioned above, the lower tusks of the &quot;Amebelodon&quot; were distinctive in that they were relatively long, slender, and flattened. Because of the resemblance of these lower tusks to shovels, &quot;Amebelodon&quot; is commonly referred to as a &quot;shovel-tusked&quot; gomphothere (another shovel-tusked gomphothere that may or may not be closely related to &quot;Amebelodon&quot; is &quot;Platybelodon&quot;). There has long been an assumption that these lower tusks were actually used as shovels by the animal during feeding, presumably to dig up water plants. However, an analysis of wear patterns has shown that these lower tusks were most likely used in a variety of ways in addition to shoveling, including scraping bark from trees. Overall, the evidence indicates that this animal was a versatile browser (an animal that eats broad-leaved plants rather than grass), feeding in both wet and dry settings in a variety of ways. For reasons that are not clearly explained in the literature, &quot;Amebelodon&quot; is usually portrayed with a short, flap-like trunk (this is true of the associated picture). However, considerable evidence indicates that &quot;Amebelodon&quot; actually had a long, flexible trunk very much like that found in modern elephants, and that it probably was important for feeding, drinking, etc.

&quot;Amebelodon&quot; was once thought to be widespread, but a study of &quot;Konobelodon&quot; in 2012 shortened the genus&#x27; range span, with the specimens found in China moved to the genus &quot;Protanancus&quot;.

<text>The Government of Ireland () is the executive authority of Ireland, headed by the , the head of government. The government – also known as the cabinet – is composed of ministers, each of whom must be a member of the , which consists of and . Ministers are usually assigned a government department with a covering specific policy areas although provision exists for the appointment of a minister without portfolio.

The taoiseach must be nominated by the Dáil, the house of representatives. Following the nomination of the , the president of Ireland appoints the . The president also appoints members of the government on the nomination of the and their approval by the . The taoiseach nominates one member of the government as , the deputy head of government. The government is dependent on the Oireachtas to pass primary legislation and as such, the government needs to command a majority in the to ensure support and confidence for budgets and the passage of government legislation.

The 35th government of Ireland entered office on 23 January 2025 with Micheál Martin, leader of , as , and Simon Harris, leader of , as . It is a coalition government of , and a group of independent TDs, and was formed after negotiations following a general election in December 2024.

==Government==
Membership of the cabinet is regulated by Article 28 of the Constitution of Ireland and by the Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924 to 2020. The Constitution requires the government to consist of between seven and fifteen members, all of whom must be a member of the Oireachtas.

Since the formation of the 12th government of Ireland in 1966, all Irish cabinets have been formed with the constitutional maximum of fifteen ministers. The total sometimes falls below this number for brief periods following the resignation of individual ministers or the withdrawal of a party from a coalition.

No more than two members of the cabinet may be members of . All other members of the cabinet must be members of Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives. The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance must be members of the Dáil. In practice, however, the members of the cabinet are invariably members of the Dáil. Since the adoption of the 1937 Constitution, only two ministers have been appointed from the Seanad: Seán Moylan who served in 1957 as Minister for Agriculture and James Dooge who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1981 to 1982. Joseph Connolly, a member of the Free State Seanad, had served in the Executive Council of the Irish Free State from 1932 to 1933 as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and from 1933 to 1936 as Minister for Lands and Fisheries.

A member of the government in charge of a Department of State is designated a minister of the Government (before 1977 this position was termed &quot;Minister of State&quot;). For distinction, Ministers of State (known before 1977 as Parliamentary Secretaries) – informally called junior ministers – are not Ministers of the Government, but assist those ministers in their departments. A minister without portfolio may be appointed to the Government who is not the head of a Department of State; this occurred during the period known in Ireland as the Emergency when Frank Aiken served as Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures from 1939 until 1945. The functions of government ministers are frequently transferred between departments during cabinet reshuffles or after elections. On occasion, a department of state will cease to exist, its functions being transferred to another department. Such defunct ministerial positions include the Ministers for Labour, Posts and Telegraphs, Public Service and Supplies.

==Non-members attending cabinet==
Non-members have no voting rights at cabinet but may otherwise participate fully, and normally receive circulated cabinet papers on the same basis as a full member of government. Votes are rare, however, with the cabinet usually following the Taoiseach or working by consensus.

The government is advised by the Attorney General, who is not a member of the government, but who participates in cabinet meetings as part of their role as legal advisor to the government.

The Chief Whip may attend meetings of the cabinet, but is not a member of the government. In addition, the government can select other Ministers of State who may attend cabinet meetings. Up to three Ministers of State who regularly attend cabinet meetings may receive an allowance. This person is informally known as a &quot;super junior minister&quot;. Ministers of state attending cabinet in the 35th government are Mary Butler, Hildegarde Naughton, Noel Grealish, and Seán Canney. Trinity College Dublin law professor Oran Doyle has argued that this practice breaches cabinet confidentiality as required by the Constitution. In January 2025, opposition TDs Pa Daly and Paul Murphy challenged the attendance of ministers of state at cabinet.

==Term of office==
A new government is formed by the taoiseach appointed after each general election after receiving the nomination of the Dáil. All members of the government are deemed to have resigned on the resignation of the taoiseach. Therefore, a new government is appointed where there is a new taoiseach within a single Dáil term. The Constitution allows a Dáil term of no more than seven years, but a shorter period may be specified by law; this has been set as a maximum of five years. The taoiseach may at any time advise the president to dissolve the Dáil, prompting a new general election.

The taoiseach must retain the confidence of Dáil Éireann to remain in office. If the taoiseach ceases &quot;to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann&quot;, the taoiseach must resign unless they seek a dissolution of the Dáil which is granted by the president. This applies only in cases of a motion of no confidence or loss of supply (rejection of a budget), rather than the defeat of the government in other legislation or Dáil votes. The president retains absolute discretion to refuse to grant a dissolution to a taoiseach who has lost the confidence of the Dáil. To date, no President has refused the request of a Taoiseach to dissolve the Dáil.

The taoiseach can direct the president to dismiss or accept the resignation of individual ministers. When the taoiseach resigns, the entire government is deemed to have resigned as a collective. However, in such a scenario, according to the Constitution, &quot;the Taoiseach and the other members of the government shall continue to carry on their duties until their successors shall have been appointed&quot;.

On the dissolution of Dáil Éireann, ministers who were TDs cease to be members of the Oireachtas. However, the Constitution also provides that &quot;the members of the Government in the office at the date of a dissolution of Dáil Éireann shall continue to hold office until their successors shall have been appointed&quot;.

==Caretaker Government==
Where the resignation of the taoiseach and government is not immediately followed by the appointment by the president of a new taoiseach on the nomination of the Dáil, the outgoing government continues as a caretaker government to &quot;carry out their duties until their successors have been appointed&quot;. This has happened when no candidate was nominated for taoiseach when the Dáil first assembled after a general election, or, on one occasion, where a taoiseach had lost the confidence of the Dáil, but there was not a dissolution of the Dáil followed by a general election.

==Authority and powers==
The government of Ireland is both the and executive authority in Ireland. This is in contrast to some other parliamentary regimes, where the head of state is the nominal chief executive, though bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In Ireland, however, the Constitution explicitly vests executive authority in the government, not the president.

The executive authority of the government is subject to certain limitations. In particular:
*The state may not declare war, or participate in a war, without the consent of the Dáil. In the case of &quot;actual invasion&quot;, however, &quot;the Government may take whatever steps they may consider necessary for the protection of the State&quot;.

Government ministers are collectively responsible for the actions of the government. Each minister is responsible for the actions of his or her department. Departments of State do not have legal personalities. Actions of departments are carried out under the title of ministers even, as is commonly the case when the minister has little knowledge of the details of these actions. This contradicts the rule in common law that a person given a statutory power cannot delegate that power. This leads to a phrase in correspondence by government departments, &quot;the Minister has directed me to write&quot;, on letters or documents that the minister in question may never have seen.

If the government, or any member of the government, should fail to fulfil its constitutional duties, it may be ordered to do so by a court of law, by a writ of . Ministers who fail to comply may, ultimately, be found to be in contempt of court, and even imprisoned.

==History==
Prior to independence, the executive of the unilaterally declared Irish Republic was the Ministry of Dáil Éireann. This was in operation from 1919 to 1922. After the approval of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922, a Provisional Government of Ireland was established as the executive. The personnel of the Provisional Government overlapped with the Ministry of Dáil Éireann, but they were not identical. On the independence of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922, both executives were succeeded by the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. On 29 December 1937, on the coming into force of the Constitution of Ireland, the Eighth Executive Council of the Irish Free State became the First Government of Ireland.

The detail and structure of the Government of Ireland has its legislative basis in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924; it has been amended on a number of occasions, and these may be cited together as the Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924 to 2020 and are construed together as one Act.

All governments from 1989 to 2016 were coalitions of two or more parties. The first coalition government was formed in 1948. The Taoiseach has almost always been the leader of the largest party in the coalition, with the exceptions of John A. Costello, Taoiseach from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957 (a member of Fine Gael but not the party leader) and Leo Varadkar, from 2022 to 2024, and Simon Harris, from 2024 to 2025 (leaders of Fine Gael, in a three-party coalition where Fianna Fáil was the largest party).

==Public service==

The public service in Ireland refers to the totality of public administration in Ireland. As of Q3, 2016 the total number of employees in the Irish public service stands at 304,472 people. The Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform defines the public service as comprising seven sectors: the civil service, defence sector, education sector, health sector, justice sector, local authorities and non-commercial state agencies (such as Bord Bia, IDA Ireland and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities). Commercial state-owned bodies such as RTÉ, ESB Group and An Post are not part of the public service in Ireland.

The largest sector is the health sector with over 105,000 employees (largely in the Health Service Executive), followed by the education sector with approximately 98,450.

===Public service employees===
===Largest single public sector bodies by employees===
===Civil service===

The civil service of Ireland consists of two broad components, the &quot;Civil Service of the Government&quot; and the &quot;Civil Service of the State&quot;. While this partition is largely theoretical, the two parts do have some fundamental operational differences. The civil service is expected to maintain political impartiality in its work, and some parts of it are entirely independent of government decision-making.

==Current government of Ireland==

Micheál Martin was nominated as Taoiseach by Dáil Éireann on 23 January 2025 and appointed by the president. Martin nominated the government members, and after their approval by the Dáil, they were appointed by the president.

<text>Ten Tors is an annual weekend hike in early May, on Dartmoor, southwest England. Organized by the British Army, starting in 1960, it brings together teams of six young people, with the 2,400 young participants hiking to checkpoints on ten specified tors. The majority of entrants are schools, colleges, Scout groups and Cadet squadrons from South West England, though groups from across the UK have regularly taken part, as have teams from Australia and New Zealand. However, from 2012, only teams from the South West of England are eligible to take part, due to the large numbers of entrants.

== Event format ==
Teams of six are required to visit ten specified tors; on the top of each tor is a checkpoint. Each team is required to visit all of the specified checkpoints in order. Up to two members per team may fall out during the Challenge; teams falling below this number could merge in earlier years, while later rules required a badly reduced team to forfeit.

There are 26 different routes over three different distances, lettered from A to Z, using a total of 19 different manned tors: 12 Bronze (Junior) routes of for those aged 14 to 15 years; 10 Silver (Intermediate) routes of for those aged 16 to 17 years; and 4 Gold (Senior or Arduous) routes of for those aged 18 to 19 years, or 17-year-olds who completed a Silver or Bronze route previously.

The organisers stress that the event is not a race – although teams often compete to see who can finish first – but a test of endurance, navigation and survival skills, because of not just the distances and the challenging terrain, but potentially also the weather; conditions on Dartmoor can vary considerably and change suddenly. In 1996, for example, the event was struck by a heavy snow storm, leading to some teams still being out on the moor a day after the event was due to have finished; while in 1998 temperatures reached 26 °C (79 °F).

Participants arrive at Okehampton Camp on the Thursday or Friday before the hike, watch a safety briefing video and have their equipment checked, a thorough process known as scrutineering. Teams must carry all their food, clothing, tents, stoves, fuel, navigation equipment, maps, emergency rations and a first aid kit; they also collect drinking water from the moor and use water purification tablets. Each team has a nominated team leader, who is responsible for ensuring that the team&#x27;s route card is stamped at each tor.

All the teams start at 0700 on the Saturday from an area of flat land next to Anthony Stile, close to Okehampton Camp on the northern edge of Dartmoor. They stand in a semicircle and set off when a cannon fires. They have 34 hours to visit each of the ten tors on their route in the correct order. Teams must not pass through a checkpoint between 2200 on Saturday and 0600 on Sunday morning; nor may they pass the eighth tor until the Sunday. Those on 35 mile routes must camp at one of the manned tors on their route, while 45 and 55 mile teams may camp anywhere on the moor (minimum of 1km away from any checkpoints). Teams must arrive back at Anthony Stile by 1700 on the Sunday, having visited all ten tors on their route in order, to qualify for a medal and complimentary pasty. Teams that finish the challenge as a complete six also receive a certificate.

==History of the event==
The first Ten Tors Expedition took place in September 1960, with around 200 young people taking part. By 1980, the numbers had grown to more than 2,600. To protect the environment, the numbers are now limited to 2,400 individuals: 400 teams of four to six teenagers. The Army uses the event as a large scale logistics training exercise.

Until 1967, the event was organised by the Junior Leaders Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals. This responsibility passed to Headquarters South West District, and in 1986 to 43 (Wessex) Brigade, the regional Headquarters of the Territorial Army in the South West.

Since 1977, an additional event, The Jubilee Challenge, has been held for young people with physical or learning disabilities. This involves a selection of four routes of between , both on road and cross-country.

Many military units and civilian groups provide support for this event and the Jubilee Challenge, including the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, Exeter UOTC, 243 Field Hospital RAMC, 6th Battalion The Rifles, two Sea King HC4 helicopters from 848 Naval Air Squadron, 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment, two Gazelle helicopters from 7 Regiment Army Air Corps (Volunteers), Bristol UOTC, and the Dartmoor Rescue Group.

===1981===
The first ever Junior Army Team from Junior Leaders Regiment Royal Armoured Corps JLR RAC finished the Gold Course with 24 minutes to spare, despite several of the six-strong team having severe foot injuries. They were cheered home by an honour guard of Royal Marines and Paratroopers who walked with the boys over the last mile.

===1993===
&quot;Tavistock Times&quot; reports &quot;Hurricane Force&quot; winds during the event.

===1996===
A cold northerly wind on the Saturday of the 1996 event turned to rain and snow overnight. This continued through Sunday, accompanied by fog and driving wind. Requests from Tor party commanders, two of whom had their tents destroyed, added to pressure to abandon the event, and there was a mass evacuation of the moor on the Sunday afternoon, the first time the event had been terminated early. Fifty-one teams completed their routes, but no record remains of their success. Ten Tors, A History

===2001===
Ten Tors was cancelled in 2001 due to the foot and mouth epidemic, but went ahead the next year.

===2003===
(69% finished Complete, + 21% with fall-outs)

For the second year in succession the Plymouth DofE Award 45 team took the honour of leading the teams over the finish line, at 08:49 (Ten Tors Teams, 2003), improving on their time of 09:23 in 2002 (Ten Tors Teams, 2002)

===2004===
(75% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs)

In 2004, the Ten Tors record for earliest complete team home was broken by R1809, Dartmoor Plodders, with a time of 08:19. This stood until 2009.

===2005===
(52% finished Complete, + 29% with fall-outs)

In 2005, one of the original teams from the 1960 Ten Tors took part in the event, which was held on 14–15 May in particularly adverse weather conditions: constant rain on the Saturday, combined with a bitter wind, leading to an unusually high number of retirements.

===2006===
(76% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs)

In 2006, the event was held over the weekend of 13–14 May, with high temperatures on the Sunday resulting in several cases of dehydration.

===2007===

On Sunday 4 March 2007, Charlotte Shaw was swept away by the rain-swollen Walla Brook near Watern Tor, while training for the event. The rest of her group raised the alarm using a mobile phone, but despite her being evacuated by a Royal Navy helicopter within 20 minutes, she died later that night in Derriford Hospital, Plymouth. In December 2009 an inquest into the death was halted for the case to be considered for criminal charges. Several other groups were also evacuated by helicopter after weather conditions on Dartmoor deteriorated.

The event itself was abandoned at 21:30 on Saturday 12 May 2007, halfway through, due to severe weather conditions; the decision was influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15% on Saturday. Participants spent the night camped at a manned Tor, before being escorted off the moor by the military the following day.

===2008===
(61% finished Complete, + 25% with fall-outs)

From 2008, the event was much changed, with different routes and use of the moor to help bird conservation in the nesting season. Steeperton Tor and Hare Tor were dropped from the Tor list, and the pass from Dinger to Kitty Tor known as &quot;Death Valley&quot; was zoned off limits. Each team was permitted only four training walks on the north moor. A review of these changes . The 2008 event was a total contrast to the previous years, with temperatures in the low 20s Celsius, and participants dropping out because of dehydration rather than hypothermia.

===2009===
(80% finished Complete, + 13% with fall-outs)

In 2009, the Ten Tors&#x27; record for the earliest complete team home since the rule change was broken with a time of 08:17 by 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts.
For the first time, an all-girls team from Torquay Grammar School for Girls also broke the record for successfully completing the 35-, 45- and 55-mile events consecutively and with the same team members (Tamsin Owen, Joyce Nie, Francesca Hill, Amelia Skerritt, Rebecca Stanley, and Hannah Short).
There were fewer dropouts than in other years in almost perfect weather conditions.

===2010===
(79% finished Complete, + 14% with fall-outs)

2010 saw the 50th anniversary of the Ten Tors event. To mark the occasion the Duke of Edinburgh visited the event on Sunday morning to speak to finishers and present some with the commemorative 50 years medals. It also marked the first year that teams carried a GPS tracker which enabled the organisers and team managers to track the participants&#x27; progress directly. The first finishers were 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts (Joshua Owen, Matthew Ryder, Luke Hayward, Jacob Shah, Paul Moroz, and William Fordyce) and King Edward&#x27;s School Bath (Robert Wilcox, James Plumstead, Benjamin Smith, Edmond Venables (son of Stephen Venables), Jonathan Tracy, and Mark Humphreys) who walked over the line together at 7:37 to break the record for earliest finishers by 40 minutes, and also finishing four and a half hours ahead of any other team on their route. This also meant the scout group had crossed the line first for three consecutive years. Notable other finishers were the &#x27;Denbury Boys&#x27; who, made up of men who completed the first ever Ten Tors, successfully completed the 35 mile event.

===2011===
(81% finished Complete, + 14% with fall-outs)

The 2011, Challenge started under a clear blue sky, but cloud obscured the tops of *West Mill and *High Willhays even then. Cloud and a fresh breeze built up through the day, but by 17:50, a blue sky was breaking through. Sunday was very similar with the first finishers (M1306 - Downend Scouts, at 08:35 Route M listing, 2011) walking in under a blue sky, but again the cloud gathered through the day. Notes from the Event.

The largely overcast and cool weekend was almost perfect walking weather - of the 390 teams which started 374 (95%) walked over the finish line, and of those finishing teams 316 (81%) walked in with all six team members. Over the last fifteen years of the event, this is the highest percentage of both Finishing and Complete teams. Sixteen teams either retired (just 7, less than 2%) or were &#x27;crashed out&#x27;, but even here the statistics are impressive – in the previous 15 years teams are noted as stopping at their second Tor onwards. In 2011, the first teams to stop reached their fifth Tor before doing so.

It was also the 60th anniversary of Dartmoor as a National Park so everyone received a participant certificate.

===2012===
(75% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs)

The first team to reach the finish line was the Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School 45-mile team, who reached camp at 8:56am.

They were soon followed by both Torbay Explorer Scouts and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital School 45-mile team, who performed an excellent display of sportsmanship by finishing the last kilometre of the course side by side, despite a failure in the alarm of the QEH team, delaying the team by a full hour.

The first 35-mile team to cross the finish was Churcher&#x27;s College, Hampshire, getting back to cap with a record breaking time of 09:21 on the Sunday morning. This was also the first all-boy team to cross the finish, and second overall.

The first all-girl team to reach the finish line, The Maynard 35-mile team, got back to camp at 10:20, setting a new time record for the school. The Maynard 45-mile team also completed the challenge in a respectable time, finishing at 13:59.

The 2012 event was notable for the selfless efforts of one team, X2414 Kingsbridge Community College (55), who were on schedule to complete their route shortly after 16:00 when they diverted to answer the distress whistles of another team which had two of its members trapped chest deep in Raybarrow Pool. After calling in the Dartmoor Rescue Group and helping the other team, X2414 walked in at 17:19, almost twenty minutes after the close of the event - this would normally debar a team from receiving their awards. The Director Ten Tors, Brigadier Piers Hankinson, met the team at the finish and presented Kingsbridge with their gold medals.

The event weather, following days of heavy rain, was cloudless, sunny, and warm with 100% visibility. Notes from the Event, 2012

===2013===

(23% of participants did not finish)

The 2013 event went down in Ten Tors history as one of the most miserable. Organisers said that if the weather had come a day earlier then the event would have been cancelled. Swollen rivers from rain over the previous weeks meant that river crossings were hazardous; teams were offered advice on the best places to cross by Dartmoor Mountain Rescue. Some young people stayed at river crossings for a number of hours, selflessly helping others to cross whilst putting their own chances of finishing on hold.

Especially on Saturday, navigation became extremely difficult as fog and mist reduced visibility to as low as 10 metres: a few less experienced 35 mile teams did not even make their first tor. The weather lifted overnight and gave teams a break from the rain, but this brought near-freezing temperatures across the whole moor. Throughout Sunday the weather worsened again.

Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital School 45 mile team S1915 were the first team to make it across the finish line on the Sunday morning at 9:20.

Teams often choose odd dress code for crossing the finishing line. School uniform, kilts, miniskirts and Chinese dragons have all featured in the past. However, this year, the Launceston College 45 mile team decided to cross the line in brightly coloured morphsuits. Whilst the rain was beginning to lash down and the traditional Dartmoor high winds persisted, the team sacrificed their finishing time (12:15) to show the spirit and good humour that makes Ten Tors.
The finishing gate was left open for an extra 45 minutes. By 11:00 on Sunday morning, over 300 people had dropped out, and by the end of the day the number of people who would not complete had increased to over 500.

===2014===

(81% finished complete) 
The first team to finish was the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher&#x27;s College, Petersfield, Hants. They came over the line at 8:24am and was a mixed team: Olivia Hart, Francesca Hussell, Jerome Greig, Ben Kelson, Edward Rodge, and Owen Tutt, around 45 minutes ahead of all other teams. In the 55 mile event, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital School were the first to finish.

===2015===
(73.7% complete 18.9% with fall-outs)

This was the 55th anniversary of Ten Tors, and to celebrate this, two teams of veterans were given special permission to take part. They did one of the 55 mile routes on the 55th anniversary, all aged over 55 (some considerably so). Most of them had completed Ten Tors as teenagers in the 1970s whilst at Exeter School, but none had had the opportunity to do the 55 mile route. Apart from being too old, they followed all the rules, carrying all the same equipment as the young people. Both teams completed the challenge complete; fourteen veterans in all, albeit fairly late in the day on the Sunday.

===2016===
(73% complete 21 with fall-outs)

2016 saw warmer weather, getting up to 20 °C across the moor. The first team to cross the finish line was Torbay Scouts who took part in the 35-mile (56 km) route at 8:51. The first 55-mile team to cross the finish line was Colyton Grammar School. They crossed the finish line at 10:52, team consisting of: Matt Domhof, Frank Hartley, Charlie King, Zoe Kuyken, Ellie Marok, and Jonny Surtees (C).

The event also generated a light-hearted news story when the downdraught from a low-flying Royal Navy Merlin Mk3 helicopter blew away a row of portable toilets. They were not occupied at the time and there were no injuries.

Adults were awarded for long service to Ten Tors with 1 40+ Platinum award, 1 30+ Diamond award and 5 20+ gold awards, including Jack Barker, from the Erme and Yealm Hillwalking Club/Ivybridge Community College receiving the Platinum and Diamond; plus Paul Johnson &amp; Peter Challiss from Tavistock &amp; District Youth Forum, receiving Gold for 20yrs service.

===2017===
The event had the perfect weather conditions, with it not being too cold or too hot, leading to 84.9% of teams reaching the finish line complete. 
First to finish were 20th Torbay Scouts, arriving back at the base camp at 08:19 Sunday, followed by Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School B at 08:37, who finished almost an hour before anyone else on their route after walking for 2.5 hours. The first 55-mile team was that of Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School A, consisting of Joe Kingdon, Tom Snow, Matt Birdsall, Adam White, Harry Fox and Tom Gregory. They finished at 9:54, beating the previously held record for Route X, introduced in 2014, by 1hr35mins.

===2020===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was one of the only years in the event&#x27;s history (previously foot and mouth epidemic) that the event was cancelled unrelated to weather conditions. All prospective participants were given certificates for their efforts in training for the event.

===2023===
(91.2% of teams finished, 25.6% of teams finished with fall-outs, 8.8% of teams did not finish)

The 2023 Ten Tors event was a week earlier than usual, on the 28th-30th of April, due to the King&#x27;s coronation.

Jonathan Van-Tam gave a speech before the event started.

=== 2024 ===
Unusually high temperatures meant many participants crashed out due to heatstroke, with two 30-minute rest periods imposed during the event, one on each day. Ray Mears gave the commencement speech.

==Ten Tors Prayer==
Every year before the start of the event the following prayer is read.

&lt;poem&gt;
O God, who has made the earth of great beauty
and instilled in man a spirit for adventure,
we thank you for the beauty of nature
for the courage and vigour of youth
for companionship
and for the opportunity to enjoy these gifts

Go, we pray, with all who are setting out
on this great venture
among the tors of a unique and ancient moorland.
Grant that, by meeting each challenge and difficulty
with honest endeavour and unselfish courage
they may find a spirit of determination and
true comradeship
that will benefit themselves and those about them
both now and in the future.
Amen
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="553324" wikidata="Q7200857" url="?curid=553324" title="Plan-It-X Records">
<text>Plan-It-X Records (PIX) was an independent record label. Originally based in Georgetown, Indiana, PIX was based in Bloomington, Indiana following brief stints in Olympia, Washington, Gainesville, Florida, and Cairo, Illinois. The label released folk punk and pop punk music, including Against Me!&#x27;s &quot;Crime As Forgiven By&quot;, other releases include albums by This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb, Defiance, Ohio, Ghost Mice, Japanther, The Bananas, , and Antsy Pants and Fifteen.

==History==
Founded in 1994 by Samantha Jane Dorsett and Chris Clavin, Plan-It-X held a DIY punk ethic. The label sold all CDs for five dollars or less. PIX&#x27;s slogan reads: &quot;If it ain&#x27;t cheap, it ain&#x27;t punk&quot;. PIX attempted to demonstrate that the practices of major record labels do not need to be duplicated by independent record labels in order to be successful. They supported other small labels and encourage others to do so as well (and even go as far as to suggest starting your own label).
Clavin formerly played in the iconic folk punk band Ghost Mice and currently records albums and performs under the name Captain Chaos. Clavin was one of the founders of folk punk music and is a former band member of , The Devil Is Electric, The Ted Dancin&#x27; Machine, Peanucle, The Sissies, Tooth Soup and The Jammy Dodgers.

Beyond the release of musical albums, Plan-It-X has released a book by author Greg Wells (&quot;Complete Control: An Anthology 1997-2005&quot;), the zine My Friend Bubby, as well as a DVD featuring live performances of bands filmed during Plan-It-X Fest 2004 (see below). A documentary was released in 2010, put together from footage shot across the week of the 2006 Plan-It-X Fest. 

Clavin announced in 2016 that Plan-It-X would cease operations due to a variety of reasons, including the financial strain, and closed for good in 2018. 

== Plan-It-X Fest ==

In 2004 Plan-It-X Records celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a three-day festival in Bloomington, Indiana. A large portion of the bands involved with the label performed throughout the three-day event.

With the success of the 2004 fest, Plan-It-X decided to take the festival on the road the following year in 2005 with a number of their bands in a school bus. The school bus toured throughout the Eastern and Midwestern United States.

2006 saw the third Plan-It-X fest return to Bloomington as a six-day &quot;Punk Rock Summer Camp,&quot; with bands playing every night and workshops and other activities throughout the afternoon. Like the two previous fests, 2006&#x27;s fest raised money for charity. This year a total of $8,200 was split amongst three different charities.

2011 saw the fourth Plan-It-X Fest. It took place on June 24, 25, and 26 in Bloomington, Indiana. Like previous fests, this one was a benefit for several grassroots organizations. It also marked the release of PIX99, a book based on founder Samantha Dorsett&#x27;s life.

The 5th Plan-It-X Fest happened in 2012.

The 6th Plan-It-X Fest took place in 2014 in Spencer, IN.

The 7th and final Plan-It-X Fest took place in Spencer, IN from July 22 to the 24th, 2016. This festival was filmed for a short YouTube documentary by Punk With A Camera entitled &quot;And One For Good Luck - The Last Plan-It-X Fest&quot;. Artists performing included Ramshackle Glory, Ghost Mice, Terror Pigeon, The Wild, Pioneers Press author Adam Gnade, Super Famicom, Erin Tobey, Your Heart Breaks and many more.

<text>Diana Muldaur (born August 19, 1938) is an American film and television actress. Muldaur&#x27;s television roles include Rosalind Shays on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; and Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. She appeared in two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; in the late 1960s, playing different roles (Drs. Miranda Jones and Ann Mulhall). She has been nominated for an Emmy twice, as a supporting actress on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; in 1990 and 1991.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised on the Massachusetts island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Muldaur started acting in high school and continued on through college, graduating from Sweet Briar College in Virginia in 1960. She studied acting under Stella Adler, and made her name on the New York stage. She was at one point a board member of the Screen Actors Guild and was the first woman to serve as president of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (1983–1985).

==Early career==
In 1965, Muldaur landed the role of Ann Wicker in the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;. She then did a five-episode arc as Jeannie Orloff in the final season of Richard Chamberlain&#x27;s NBC medical drama &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;.

Various roles as a guest star in episodes of numerous television shows followed, including &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, a two-episode arc on the Ben Gazzara drama &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, and as a guest star in 1975 in &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; playing Kate Darby in the episode &quot;Terror Ship&quot;.

Collaborations between Muldaur and Burt Reynolds began when Muldaur appeared in an episode of &quot;Hawk&quot; (1966), a weekly procedural with Reynolds in the title role. Subsequently, they guest-starred in a third-season episode of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; (1968), and Muldaur guest-starred in an episode of Reynolds&#x27; series &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970).

In 1967, Muldaur guest-starred on the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; episode &quot;Fandango&quot; with James Arness. An excerpt of that episode&#x27;s dialogue was sampled on the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Wall&quot;, after &quot;Hey You&quot; and before the brief song &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot;

In 1968, she appeared in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes &quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot; as astrobiologist Lieutenant Commander/Dr. Ann Mulhall, and in &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot; as psychologist Dr. Miranda Jones. During this time, a friendship with creator Gene Roddenberry formed that led to him casting Muldaur as Marg in the television film &quot;Planet Earth&quot; (1974) with John Saxon. Later, she appeared as Dr. Katherine Pulaski in 20 episodes of the second season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1988–1989).

Muldaur&#x27;s first major role was as Belle in the ABC primetime serial &quot;Harold Robbins&#x27; The Survivors&quot; (1970)&quot;.&quot; The soap, intended as a comeback vehicle for Hollywood star Lana Turner, was cancelled early into the 1970 television season after 15 episodes.

==Supporting roles in films==
After the cancellation of &quot;The Survivors&quot;, Muldaur accepted a number of supporting roles in motion pictures, including &quot;The Swimmer&quot; (1968) with Burt Lancaster, football film &quot;Number One&quot; (1969), and psychological thriller &quot;The Other&quot; (1972) with Uta Hagen. She also appeared in Sidney J. Furie&#x27;s &quot;The Lawyer&quot; (1970), &quot;One More Train to Rob&quot; (1971) with George Peppard and the John Wayne crime drama, &quot;McQ&quot; (1974).

Muldaur appeared in the ensemble-apocalypse thriller &quot;Chosen Survivors&quot; (1974) with Jackie Cooper, Richard Jaeckel, and Barbara Babcock. In 1977, she played Elaine Mati, the concerned wife of mentally unstable doctor Telly Savalas in the independent film &quot;Beyond Reason&quot;.

==Other television guest-starring roles==
In 1967, Muldaur guest-starred on &quot;Mannix&quot; episode &quot;Coffin for a Clown&quot;. In 1971, she appeared as Rachel Bonham in &quot;The Men From Shiloh&quot; (rebranded name for the TV Western &quot;The Virginian&quot;) in the episode titled &quot;The Politician&quot;. Muldaur guest-starred in a first-season episode of &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;The Great Shell Game&quot; in 1971. In the second season of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; in 1973, opposite David Carradine, she guest-starred in the episode &quot;The Elixir&quot; playing a traveling-show woman who yearned for freedom from men—topical at the time—and starred in the pilot episode of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. In a 1972 &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; episode, she was a guest star along with Ricardo Montalbán.

She had a recurring role as Judge Eleanor Hooper on &quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot; during the show&#x27;s 1976–1978 run, and was a guest star in season two of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. Muldaur guest-starred on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, playing the part of Helen Banner, David Banner&#x27;s sister, in the season-three episode &quot;Homecoming&quot; in November 1979. In 1981, she played a nun in the fifth-season episode &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

In 1975, she made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; as Mrs. Bannister, a married woman who has an affair with a former cellmate of the series&#x27; title character. During this time, Muldaur also appeared on &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, among others. She appeared in the first season of Angela Lansbury&#x27;s &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

==Recurring television roles==

=== 1970s–1980s ===
Muldaur had a recurring role on the seven-season Dennis Weaver mystery series &quot;McCloud&quot; as Chris Coughlin, McCloud&#x27;s love interest. Her character was introduced in the pilot episode in 1970, and made her last of 16 appearances in April 1977. She reprised her role as Chris for the 1989 reunion movie &quot;The Return of Sam McCloud&quot;.

Muldaur was cast as conservationist Joy Adamson in the television drama &quot;Born Free&quot; about Elsa the Lioness. Filming for the ambitious project, which co-starred Gary Collins, took place in Kenya, and the NBC series, which debuted in the fall of 1974, lasted one season. Guest stars on &quot;Born Free&quot; included several of Muldaur&#x27;s future co-stars, including Alex Cord (&quot;Chosen Survivors&quot;) and Susan Dey (&quot;L.A. Law&quot;).

In 1979, Muldaur starred with David Huddleston in the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Hizzonner&quot;, which lasted just seven episodes and co-starred Kathy Cronkite, daughter of news presenter Walter Cronkite. She played the mayor&#x27;s secretary, Ginny.

First an Emmy-winning miniseries and then a weekly drama, &quot;A Year in the Life&quot; was a critical success for NBC, with a cast including Richard Kiley and Sarah Jessica Parker. As Dr. Alice Foley, Muldaur praised the show as an example of how television was becoming more realistic about women.

===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
Muldaur is known for playing &quot;dignified, sophisticated characters&quot;. Gene Roddenberry was already familiar with Muldaur from her second-season appearance in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode, &quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot;, and later in a third-season appearance in &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot;. He subsequently cast her in his 1973 TV movie &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. Consequently, for the second season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, Roddenberry chose her specifically to replace the outgoing Gates McFadden (who was let go at the insistence of the show&#x27;s first-season producer Maurice Hurley). Muldaur was cast to play the role of Dr. Pulaski, the new chief medical officer. &quot;We needed someone with a little more of an edge,&quot; Rick Berman explained of the choice. &quot;Kate&#x27;s a strong, confident woman with an edge who can hold her own with Captain Picard. Their relationship is not all that unlike the one between Kirk and McCoy ... although from the onset we had no intention of trying to duplicate the original team.&quot;

Muldaur said after her casting

Of Pulaski&#x27;s willingness to stand up to the captain, Muldaur said

Some television critics praised Muldaur&#x27;s performance, with one noting her &quot;wry, no-nonsense warmth that plays nicely off of some of the icier regulars&quot;. The addition of Muldaur, along with Whoopi Goldberg, also served to redress the absence of women from the principal cast, as the departure of McFadden and Denise Crosby had left only Marina Sirtis, a rapid attrition of women that recalled the imbalance of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

Ultimately, Muldaur found working on the syndicated show an &quot;unhappy&quot; experience, saying, &quot;The imagination and joy wasn&#x27;t there&quot;. &quot;Everybody was out for themselves. I don&#x27;t think they were happy to have me there.&quot; &quot;It wasn&#x27;t what I hoped it would be. I thought it would be wonderfully inventive and wonderfully creative, and I found it was not any of those things, but it did give me Trekkies. I love Trekkies. I find them very dear.&quot;

The character also proved unpopular with some fans, who among other things found her treatment of the lovable android Data to be mean-spirited. Muldaur left the series after a season. Show representatives denied that she had been fired, saying, &quot;Technically, she&#x27;s just not returning&quot;, while other sources said that her option had not been renewed. Roddenberry described Muldaur as &quot;a most talented actress&quot; and said that the decision &quot;to let her go was made solely because the hoped-for chemistry between her and the rest of the starship cast did not develop.&quot; Berman added, &quot;The thought of bringing Gates back was a good idea to us. The feeling was that we had perhaps made a mistake, and the best way to remedy it was to bring her back.&quot; The &quot;revolving door&quot; and the limited opportunities for female crew led critics to suggest that the mostly male series still had a problem featuring women.

===&quot;L.A. Law&quot;===
Muldaur subsequently earned two Emmy nominations for her role as lawyer Rosalind Shays on &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. Of Roz&#x27;s creation, by prolific television writer David E. Kelley, Muldaur said:

In one episode of the Stephen Bochco drama, Jill Eikenberry&#x27;s character Ann Kelsey tells Shays: &quot;If you were a man, you&#x27;d be applauded for your achievements.&quot; Muldaur insisted her character &quot;was just too strong for a lot of men&quot;.

Muldaur described the &quot;L.A. Law&quot; actors as &quot;the closest family&quot;, and said she was &quot;thrilled&quot; to play a villain like Shays after portraying &quot;everybody&#x27;s mistress for 20 years&quot;, and expressed fascination with the public reception for Shays:

The surprise scene where Roz and Leland are seen in bed together was ranked as the 38th-greatest moment in television in an issue of &quot;EGG&quot; magazine. Equally spectacular was Roz&#x27;s fatal exit from the show, falling down an elevator shaft. Muldaur joked: &quot;I was as shocked as everybody else. I thought maybe I had asked for too much money!&quot;

Jill Eikenberry, who played Ann Kelsey on &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, said on &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; that the whole &quot;L.A. Law&quot; cast loved the dynamic between Muldaur and Richard Dysart, and that they were all very sad to see Muldaur leave the show.

===Other television series===
In 1975, Muldaur appeared in one episode in the first season of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. In 1977, she guest-starred in the second episode (&quot;Mirror Image&quot;) of the short-lived CBS espionage series &quot;Hunter&quot;. Early in 1979, she guest-starred in the second episode (&quot;Dewey and Harold and Sarah and Maggie&quot;) of the NBC anthology series &quot;$weepstake$&quot;. In the early 1990s, she also guest-starred on two episodes of &quot;Matlock&quot;, as well as &quot;Empty Nest&quot; with Richard Mulligan and the pilot for Aaron Spelling&#x27;s &quot;Hearts Are Wild&quot;. Muldaur provided the voice of Dr. Leslie Thompkins on &quot;&quot; from 1992 to 1994.

==Television films==
In 1973, Muldaur co-starred in the television film &quot;Call to Danger&quot; as Carrie Donovon, a Justice Department investigator. In 1974, Muldaur starred in &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; presentation of &quot;Hog Wild!&quot; with John Ericson and Kim Richards for NBC. In 1979, she starred in the made-for-television film version of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; in which she played the role of Katie Keller, the mother of Helen Keller. The NBC film starred Melissa Gilbert and Patty Duke Astin.

In an attempt to capitalize on Burt Reynolds&#x27; international superstardom, Muldaur&#x27;s performance in the pilot episode of the Reynolds-Norman Fell crime series, &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970–1971) was edited together with a subsequent episode and repackaged as a 1980 ABC Movie of the Week titled &quot;Dan August: The Jealousy Factor&quot;.

In 1991, Muldaur played Lauren Jeffreys, the main client of Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) in the NBC television film &quot;Perry Mason and the Case of the Fatal Fashion&quot;. Muldaur had previously worked with Burr as a guest star on the detective series &quot;Ironside&quot; (1971) and his short-lived series &quot;&quot; (1977).

Her other television films include the &quot;Black Beauty&quot; miniseries (1977), &quot;Pine Canyon is Burning&quot; (1977), &quot;Maneaters Are Loose!&quot; (1978), &quot;The Word&quot; (1978), and Joseph Wambaugh&#x27;s two-hour film &quot;Police Story: A Cry for Justice&quot; (1978) with Dennis Weaver and Larry Hagman. Muldaur teamed with The Smothers Brothers for &quot;Terror at Alcatraz&quot; (1982) and turned in strong dramatic performances in &quot;Murder in Three Acts&quot; (1986) opposite Peter Ustinov and &quot;Locked Up: A Mother&#x27;s Rage&quot; (1991) with Jean Smart and Angela Bassett.

==Personal life==
Muldaur is a 1960 graduate of Sweet Briar College, a small, private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in central Virginia. She is the older sister of singer-songwriter Geoff Muldaur, who is the former husband of singer Maria Muldaur. She is also the aunt of singer-songwriter Jenni Muldaur and singer-songwriter Clare Muldaur-Manchon. She lived in Los Angeles from 1970 to 1991. Muldaur was married to actor James Vickery, her co-star on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, until his death from cancer in 1979. She then married writer and producer Robert Dozier (son of producer William Dozier), who died of prostate cancer in 2012. Muldaur is a former Airedale Terrier breeder and owner. At one point, Muldaur contemplated a face lift, noting in 2000 at the age of 61, &quot;You don&#x27;t see many people my age on television&quot;, but eventually decided against it, remarking, &quot;Somebody has to look the right age&quot;. Her stated ambition is &quot;to play all the great women&#x27;s roles... I&#x27;d love to play Lady Macbeth.&quot;

<text>An agglomeration community (, ) is a consortium of communes (municipalities) in France, created as a government structure by the Chevènement Law of 1999. It is one of four forms of intercommunality, less integrated than a or a communauté urbaine but more integrated than a communauté de communes. Agglomeration communities consist of a commune of at least 15,000 inhabitants (or a prefecture with less than 15,000 inhabitants) and its independent suburbs.

As of March 2020, there are 222 agglomeration communities in France (207 in metropolitan France and 15 in the overseas departments). The population (as of 2017) of the agglomeration communities ranges from 355,650 inhabitants (CA Grand Paris Sud Seine-Essonne-Sénart) to 29,289 inhabitants (CA Grand Verdun).

Several former communautés d&#x27;agglomération have been converted into communautés urbaines or métropoles, for instance those of Strasbourg, Rouen, Saint-Étienne and Caen.

<text> (; French for &quot;urban community&quot;) is the second most integrated form of intercommunality in France, after the &quot;Metropolis&quot; (). A is composed of a city (commune) and its independent suburbs (independent communes).

The first communautés urbaines were created by the French Parliament on 31 December 1966. Originally there were only four, found in the metropolitan areas of Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Strasbourg. Later, others were created in other metropolitan areas. The purpose of the communautés urbaines was to achieve cooperation and joint administration between large cities and their independent suburbs. This step often followed failed attempts to merge the communes within a metropolitan area. The status of the communauté urbaine was modified by the Chevènement Law of 1999. Since the creation of the métropoles in 2011, several former communautés urbaines have become métropoles, for instance Nice, Strasbourg, Marseille, Nancy and Dijon.

Unlike the case in either a communauté d&#x27;agglomération or communauté de communes, communes cannot leave a communauté urbaine freely.

As of April 2018, there are 11 communautés urbaines in France (all in metropolitan France), with a combined population of 2.43 million inhabitants (as of 2015, in 2018 limits). All of the urban areas in France with more than half a million inhabitants are a communauté urbaine or a métropole. Some communautés urbaines are relatively small; smaller than many communautés d&#x27;agglomération.

The communautés urbaines are each administered by a council called a &quot;conseil communautaire&quot; (community council), composed of a proportional representation of members of municipal councils of member towns. The council is headed by an executive composed of a president and vice-presidents elected by the council. The president is in many cases the mayor of the main or most populous city. The mayors of the others cities are often also vice-presidents of the executive, the deputies-mayors are often members of the council, as are some members of the towns&#x27; councils.

<doc id="553383" wikidata="Q1092661" url="?curid=553383" title="Moorland">
<text>Moorland or moor is a type of habitat found in upland areas in temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands and montane grasslands and shrublands biomes, characterised by low-growing vegetation on acidic soils. Moorland, nowadays, generally means uncultivated hill land (such as Dartmoor in South West England), but also includes low-lying wetlands (such as Sedgemoor, also South West England). It is closely related to heath, although experts disagree on what precisely distinguishes these types of vegetation. Generally, moor refers to highland and high rainfall zones, whereas heath refers to lowland zones which are more likely to be the result of human activity.

Moorland habitats mostly occur in tropical Africa, northern and western Europe, and South America. Most of the world&#x27;s moorlands are diverse ecosystems. In the extensive moorlands of the tropics, biodiversity can be extremely high. Moorland also bears a relationship to tundra (where the subsoil is permafrost or permanently frozen soil), appearing as the tundra and the natural tree zone. The boundary between tundra and moorland constantly shifts with climatic change.

== Heather moorland ==
Heathland and moorland are the most extensive areas of semi-natural vegetation in the British Isles. The eastern British moorlands are similar to heaths but are differentiated by having a covering of peat. On western moors, the peat layer may be several metres thick. Scottish &quot;muirs&quot; are generally heather moors, but also have extensive covering of grass, cotton-grass, mosses, bracken and under-shrubs such as crowberry, with the wetter moorland having sphagnum moss merging into bog-land.

There is uncertainty about how many moors were created by human activity. Oliver Rackham writes that pollen analysis shows that some moorland, such as in the islands and extreme north of Scotland, are clearly natural, never having had trees, whereas much of the Pennine moorland area was forested in Mesolithic times. How much the deforestation was caused by climatic changes and how much by human activity is uncertain.

== Ecology ==
A variety of distinct habitat types are found in different world regions of moorland. The wildlife and vegetation forms often lead to high endemism because of the severe soil and microclimate characteristics. An example of this is the Exmoor Pony, a rare horse breed which has adapted to the harsh conditions in England&#x27;s Exmoor.

In Europe, the associated fauna consists of bird species such as red grouse, hen harrier, merlin, golden plover, curlew, skylark, meadow pipit, whinchat, ring ouzel, and twite. Other species dominate in moorlands elsewhere. Reptiles are few due to the cooler conditions. In Europe, only the common viper is frequent, though in other regions moorlands are commonly home to dozens of reptile species. Amphibians such as frogs are well represented in moorlands. When moorland is overgrazed, woody vegetation is often lost, being replaced by coarse, unpalatable grasses and bracken, with a greatly reduced fauna.

Some hill sheep breeds, such as Scottish Blackface and the Lonk, thrive on the austere conditions of heather moors.

== Management ==
Burning of moorland has been practised for a number of reasons, for example, when grazing is insufficient to control growth. This is recorded in Britain in the fourteenth century. Uncontrolled burning frequently caused (and causes) problems and was forbidden by statute in 1609. With the rise of sheep and grouse management in the nineteenth century, it again became common practice. Heather is burnt at about 10 or 12 years old when it will regenerate easily. Left longer, the woodier stems will burn more aggressively and will hinder regrowth. Burning of moorland vegetation needs to be very carefully controlled, as the peat itself can catch fire, and this can be difficult if not impossible to extinguish. In addition, uncontrolled burning of heather can promote alternative bracken and rough grass growth, which ultimately produces poorer grazing. As a result, burning is now a controversial practice; Rackham calls it &quot;second-best land management&quot;.

Mechanical cutting of the heather has been used in Europe, but it is important for the material to be removed to avoid smothering regrowth. If heather and other vegetation are left for too long, a large volume of dry and combustible material builds up. This may result in a wildfire burning out a large area, although it has been found that heather seeds germinate better if subject to the brief heat of controlled burning.

In terms of managing moorlands for wildlife, in the UK, vegetation characteristics are important for passerine abundance, whilst predator control benefits red grouse, golden plover, and curlew abundances. To benefit multiple species, many management options are required. However, management needs to be carried out in locations that are also suitable for species in terms of physical characteristics such as topography, climate and soil.

== In literature ==

The development of a sensitivity to nature and one&#x27;s physical surroundings grew with the rise of interest in landscape painting, and particularly the works of artists that favoured wide and deep prospects, and rugged scenery. To the English Romantic imagination, moorlands fitted this image perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of the story by placing it within a heightened and evocative landscape. Moorland forms the setting of various works of late Romantic English literature, ranging from the Yorkshire moorland in Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; by Frances Hodgson Burnett to Dartmoor in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Holmesian mystery &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. They are also featured in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; representing the heroine&#x27;s desolation and loneliness after leaving Mr Rochester.

Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Famous Five&quot; series featured the young protagonists adventuring across various moorlands where they confronted criminals or other individuals of interest. Such a setting enhanced the plot as the drama unfolded away from the functioning world where the children could solve their own problems and face greater danger. Moorland in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire is the setting for Walter Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Pendle Witches&quot;, the true story of some of England&#x27;s most infamous witch trials. In Erin Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Warriors&quot; series, one of the four Clans, WindClan, lives in the moorland alone.

Michael Jecks, author of Knights Templar Mysteries, sets his books in and around Dartmoor, England. Paul Kingsnorth’s &quot;Beast&quot; is also set on a western English moor, using the barren landscape and fields of heather to communicate themes of timelessness and distance from civilization.

<doc id="553384" wikidata="Q1170214" url="?curid=553384" title="The Problem of Thor Bridge">
<text>&quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes short story by Arthur Conan Doyle collected in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1927). It was first published in 1922 in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; (UK) and &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; (US).

==Plot==

Neil Gibson, the Gold King and former senator from &quot;some Western state&quot;, approaches Sherlock Holmes to investigate the murder of his wife Maria in order to clear his children&#x27;s governess, Grace Dunbar, of the crime. It soon emerges that Mr Gibson&#x27;s marriage had been unhappy and he treated his wife very badly. He had fallen in love with her when he met her in Brazil, but soon realised they had nothing in common. He became attracted to Miss Dunbar; since he could not marry her, he had attempted to please her in other ways, such as trying to help people less fortunate than himself.

Maria Gibson was found lying in a pool of blood on Thor Bridge with a bullet through the head and note from the governess, agreeing to a meeting at that location, in her hand. A recently discharged revolver with one shot fired is found in Miss Dunbar&#x27;s wardrobe. Holmes agrees to look at the situation in spite of the damning evidence.

From the outset, Holmes observes some rather odd things about the case. How could Miss Dunbar so coolly and rationally have planned and carried out the murder and then carelessly tossed the murder weapon into her wardrobe? What was the strange chip on the underside of the bridge&#x27;s stone balustrade? Why was Mrs Gibson clutching the note from Miss Dunbar when she died? If the murder weapon was one of a matched pair of pistols, why couldn&#x27;t the other one be found in Mr Gibson&#x27;s collection?

Holmes uses his powers of deduction to solve the crime, and demonstrates, using Watson&#x27;s revolver, how it was perpetrated: Mrs Gibson, outraged and jealous of Miss Dunbar&#x27;s relationship with her husband, resolved to end her own life and frame her rival for the crime. After arranging a meeting with Miss Dunbar, requesting her to leave her response in a note, Mrs Gibson tied a rock on a piece of string to the end of a revolver, and shot herself, the rock pulling the revolver over the side of the bridge; the revolver found in Miss Dunbar&#x27;s wardrobe was the other pistol of the pair, which had been fired off in the woods earlier, and the chip in the bridge was caused by the pistol hitting the stonework as it was pulled off by the rock. Holmes&#x27;s reconstruction reproduces the damage to the balustrade of the bridge. He asks the police to drag the lake for the revolvers of Watson and Gibson.

==Commentary==
The story is notable within the Sherlock Holmes canon for the initial reference to a tin dispatchbox, located within the vaults of the Cox and Co. Bank at Charing Cross in London, where Dr. Watson kept the papers concerning some of Holmes&#x27; unsolved or unfinished cases. According to Watson: &quot;Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world&quot;. The unknown fate of Phillimore has been a subject for many subsequent stories including: &quot;The Disappearance of Mr. James Phillimore&quot; by Ellery Queen; &quot;The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle&quot; by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr; &quot;The Enigma of the Warwickshire Vortex&quot; by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre; &quot;The Problem of the Sore Bridge&quot; by Philip J. Farmer; one episode of the Italian comic book series &quot;Storie di Altrove&quot; (a spin-off from the more famous Martin Mystère); Bert Coules&#x27;s BBC Radio adaptation &quot;The Singular Inheritance of Miss Gloria Wilson&quot; from &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;; and two books by Marvin Kaye, &quot;The Incredible Umbrella&quot; (Doubleday, 1979) and &quot;The Amorous Umbrella&quot; (Doubleday, 1981). Also mentioned are the case of Isadora Persano, &quot;who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science&quot; and that of the cutter &quot;Alicia&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in two parts in February and March 1922, and in the US in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in the same months. The story was published with seven illustrations by A. Gilbert in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with six illustrations by G. Patrick Nelson in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
&quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot; was adapted as a short silent film titled &quot;The Mystery of Thor Bridge&quot; in 1923 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.

The story was adapted for the Sherlock Holmes 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing, but the episode is now lost.

The story was also dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV&#x27;s series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett with Daniel Massey as Neil Gibson, Celia Gregory as Maria Gibson, and Catherine Russell as Grace Dunbar.

A similar framing method is used in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, Season 8, Episode 17 (1992) &quot;To the Last Will I Grapple with Thee&quot;.

In the 2005 &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Who Shot Sherlock?&quot; (Season 5, Episode 11), the method of killing was mostly similar, with changes including the chip coming off the gun instead of the stonework (of a fireplace). But rather than a suicide staged to frame one of the suspects, it turned out another suspect had staged the death.

The professor in &quot;Elementary&quot;, Season 1, Episode 9 (2012), has the same motive as Mrs Gibson and a similar framing method. The same cause of death deduced by Holmes in this story is used in the opening sequence of the same series, Season 2, Episode 9 (2013), with the same intent of throwing suspicion on to another party.

===Radio and audio dramas===
&quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot; was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 16 March 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another radio dramatisation of the story aired on 13 June 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; as an episode that aired on 3 November 1940. Another adaptation of the story aired on 1 October 1945. Both episodes starred Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.

A radio adaptation titled &quot;Thor Bridge&quot; aired in 1962 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was dramatised by Michael Hardwick. Robert Ayres played J. Neil Gibson.

&quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring William Hootkins as J. Neil Gibson.

In 2012, the story was adapted for radio as part of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2023, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a thwo-episodes adventure called &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Literature===
&quot;The Problem of Three-Toll Bridge&quot; by fantasy author Josh Reynolds, featuring sage-detective Zavant Konniger and his halfling manservant Vido, was published 2012 in issue 25 of Warhammer Fantasy magazine &quot;Hammer and Bolter&quot;.

<doc id="553388" wikidata="Q824910" url="?curid=553388" title="Commissioner of Yukon">
<text>The commissioner of Yukon () is the representative of the Government of Canada in the Canadian federal territory of Yukon. The commissioner is appointed by the federal government and, in contrast to the governor general of Canada or the lieutenant governors of the Canadian provinces, is not a viceroy and therefore not a direct representative of the Canadian monarch in the territory &quot;eo ipso&quot;.

==List of commissioners==
===Commissioners (1894–1918)===
Before the Yukon became a Territory on June 13, 1898, the Dominion agent/gold commissioner (Constantine and Fawcett) and the chief executive officer of the Yukon (Walsh for the first part of his term) was the Yukon representative.
===Gold commissioners===
The offices of Commissioner and Administrator were abolished in 1918. Office replaced by the &quot;Gold Commissioner&quot; who was responsible to the federal Minister of the Interior (and since 1936 the Minister of Mines and Resources). Gosselin was not a Commissioner 
===Comptrollers===
The positions of Gold Commissioner and Comptroller were combined in 1932 with the Comptroller being the title for the chief executive. The title was changed to &quot;Controller&quot; in 1936.
===Commissioners (1948–present)===

In 1948, the title of chief executive once again became &quot;Commissioner&quot;. By the 1960s, the Commissioner had formed an executive committee that included some members of the elected Territorial Council, in essence a cabinet. (By the mid-1970s, the Territorial Council was referring to itself as a Legislative Assembly, and its members MLAs rather than Councillors.) Beginning in 1978, Yukon had party government with a &quot;Government Leader&quot;.

In October 1979, federal minister Jake Epp (Indian Affairs and Northern Development) issued a letter, often known as the Epp letter, instructing the Commissioner to assume a role similar to that of a provincial Lieutenant-Governor, and devolving leadership of the day-to-day government to the majority leader of the &quot;legislative assembly&quot; (territorial council), to whom the Epp letter granted the authority to use the title Premier. At that time, the government leader added a fifth elected member to the committee, which became an executive council.

Subsequent federal ministers did not revoke this authority and instruction, which was eventually codified in amendments to the Yukon Act, along with redesignation of the legislative assembly from territorial council. The process, particularly since 1979, has devolved powers from the federal government to the territorial government, bringing authority which is normally reserved by the Articles of Confederation for provinces to the territory.

Reason Foundation publishes the &quot;Annual Privatization Report&quot;, which reports on news and trends in U.S. outsourcing, privatization, and public-private partnerships. &quot;Privatization Watch&quot; is another of the Foundation&#x27;s privatization publications published quarterly. &quot;Innovators in Action&quot; is an annual publication that advocates shrinking the size and scope of government, usually through privatization. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens wrote columns for this publication in 2007.

===&quot;Annual Highway Report&quot;===
Reason Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Annual Highway Report&quot; ranks each state&#x27;s transportation system on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. In 2021, the report ranked North Dakota, Virginia, Missouri, Kentucky, and North Carolina as having the most cost-effective highway systems, with New Jersey, Rhode Island, Alaska, Hawaii, and New York having &quot;the worst combination of highway performance and cost-effectiveness.&quot;

===&quot;Reason&quot; magazine===

Reason Foundation&#x27;s primary publication is the magazine, &quot;Reason&quot;, which was first published in 1968 by Lanny Friedlander, and was originally an infrequently published mimeographed magazine. In 1970, Robert Poole purchased &quot;Reason&quot; with Manuel S. Klausner and Tibor R. Machan, who set the magazine on a more regular publication schedule. The magazine covers politics, culture, and ideas through a mix of news, analysis, commentary, and reviews.

&quot;Reason&quot; and Reason Online are editorially-independent publications of the foundation. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine won three Los Angeles Press Club awards in 2008.

==Policy areas==

===Privatization===
Reason Foundation co-founder Robert Poole &quot;is credited as the first person to use the term &#x27;privatization&#x27; to refer to the contracting-out of public services and is the author of the first-ever book on municipal privatization, &quot;Cutting Back City Hall&quot;, published by Universe Books in 1980.&quot; The book was very influential, notably, by providing the intellectual support for Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s privatization efforts in the United Kingdom. Thatcher wrote in the foundation&#x27;s &quot;Annual Privatization Report 2006&quot;, &quot;State control is fundamentally bad because it denies people the power to choose and the opportunity to bear responsibility for their own actions. Conversely, privatisation shrinks the power of the state and free enterprise enlarges the power of the people.&quot;

The Reason Foundation supports the privatization of (or public-private partnerships for) almost all government functions. Leonard Gilroy, Reason Foundation&#x27;s director of government reform, describes privatization as &quot;a strategy to lower the costs of government and achieve higher performance and better outcomes for tax dollars spent.&quot; Gilroy also notes that &quot;If badly executed, privatization like any other policy can fail. Taxpayers are no better off, and may be worse off, if a service is moved from a government agency to an incompetent or inefficient private business.&quot;

===Transportation===
In 2005, Reason was engaged in several transportation policy endeavors. Poole served as the director of transportation policy. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;[f]or 17 years, Mr. Poole has been the chief theorist for private solutions to gridlock. His ideas are now embraced by officials from Sacramento to Washington.&quot;

===Education===
Reason Foundation advocates for education reform through expanded school choice initiatives. Reason&#x27;s director of education and child welfare, Lisa Snell, authored a study in 2009 entitled &quot;Weighted Student Formula Yearbook 2009&quot;, which examined school districts using student-based &quot;backpack funding.&quot; Snell is also: &quot;an advisory board member to the National Quality Improvement Center for the Children&#x27;s Bureau; on the charter school accreditation team for the American Academy for Liberal Education; and serves as a board member for the California Virtual Academy.&quot;

===Municipal broadband===
In 2006, Reason Foundation issued a report criticizing a municipal Wi-Fi project iProvo in Provo, Utah as financially unstable and ineffective at lowering Internet costs or raising broadband use. iProvo proponents responded vigorously with a white paper rebutting Reason&#x27;s conclusions.

In 2008, Reason issued a follow-up report entitled, &quot;iProvo Revisited: Another Year and Still Struggling&quot;. According to Reason, the predictions in its first report had proven true: &quot;iProvo&#x27;s total losses are likely to exceed $10 million by the end of this fiscal year – and that figure doesn&#x27;t include the $39.5 million borrowed to launch the project, most of which still needs to be paid back.&quot; Reason called for the city to &quot;cut its losses&quot; and sell the network to a private company. Shortly after the 2008 report was issued, the mayor of Provo, Lewis Billings, who had been highly critical of the Reason reports, announced that iProvo would in fact be sold to a private enterprise, Broadweave, for $40 million.

===Climate change===
In 2005, &quot;Reason&quot; magazine&#x27;s science writer Ronald Bailey wrote a column declaring that climate change is both real and anthropogenic. He wrote, &quot;Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up. All data sets – satellite, surface, and balloon – have been pointing to rising global temperatures.&quot;

In 2006, Bailey wrote an article entitled &quot;Confessions of an Alleged ExxonMobil Whore: Actually no one paid me to be wrong about global warming. Or anything else.&quot; In the article Bailey explains how increasing public rebuff changed his mind on climate change.

According to DeSmog, &quot;Reason&quot; is skeptical of the negative impact of climate change.

===War in Iraq===
The Reason Foundation was critical of the cost of the war in Iraq. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine&#x27;s May 2008 cover story, &quot;Trillion Dollar War&quot;, discussed what it viewed as the dubious ways in which the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have been funded by Congress, the military–industrial complex, and the Bush administration.

===Health care===
On August 25, 2010, ReasonTV published a video entitled, &quot;Wheat, Weed and Obamacare: How the Commerce Clause Made Congress All-Powerful&quot;, as part of an effort to question the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also known as Obamacare. The video has been credited with popularizing the argument in conservative circles that PPACA&#x27;s individual mandate to buy health insurance is constitutionally equivalent to requiring consumers to buy particular types of fruits or vegetables. This argument was ultimately articulated by Justice Antonin Scalia, who suggested during oral argument of the PPACA cases that if Congress has the power to require Americans to buy health insurance, then &quot;Therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.&quot;

==Bastiat Prize==
Reason Foundation issued an annual Bastiat Prize (named after Frédéric Bastiat) to recognize writing that &quot;best demonstrates the importance of freedom with originality, wit and eloquence&quot;. Awardees include Bari Weiss, Radley Balko, Daniel Hannan, Robert Graboyes, Ross Clark, Virginia Postrel, Tom Easton, Bret Stephens, Amit Varma, Jamie Whyte, Tim Harford, Robert Guest, Brian Carney, and Amity Shlaes.

==Drew Carey Project and Reason TV==
Comedian and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; host Drew Carey serves on the board of trustees at Reason Foundation. According to an interview by Katherine Herrup of &quot;The New York Sun&quot; with Nick Gillespie (current editor-in-chief of Reason TV), Carey initially proposed the idea for Reason TV after reading &quot;Reason&quot; magazine for years. He then both appeared in and narrated many videos produced by Reason TV.

One of the collaboration&#x27;s first projects, Carey&#x27;s video criticizing the Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s medical marijuana raids, received significant national attention, Some of his other videos for the foundation have promoted free trade; criticized the government&#x27;s raids of local poker games and an Arizona attempt to ban dancing in a family restaurant (&quot;Footloose in Arizona&quot;); highlighted a ban on bacon-wrapped hot dogs in Los Angeles; detailed abuse of eminent domain laws; called for more toll roads to relieve congestion; argued for deregulation of organ donation (including kidneys and other organs); and called for immigration reform.

Reason TV produced a full-length documentary entitled &quot;Reason Saves Cleveland with Drew Carey&quot; applying success stories from around the United States to &quot;save Cleveland.&quot; The documentary was awarded &quot;Best Advocacy Journalism&quot; at the 53rd Annual Southern California Journalism Awards by the Los Angeles Press Club.

==Oath of Presidential Transparency==

Reason Foundation and a bipartisan group of more than thirty other organizations asked all of the 2008 U.S. presidential candidates to sign a pledge promising that, if elected, they would deliver the most transparent presidency in history and guaranteeing the executive branch would adhere to the concepts of open government. The candidates who signed the oath were: Sen. Barack Obama (D–Illinois), Rep. Ron Paul (R–Texas), Sen. Sam Brownback (R–Kansas), former Sen. Mike Gravel (D–Alaska), Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D–Ohio), Libertarian candidate Bob Barr, and John Cox.

Reason Foundation&#x27;s vice president of research Adrian Moore said of the oath, &quot;The next president should be committed to transparency and accountability. Redesigning the federal government, so that it is more accountable to taxpayers and businesses, is a nonpartisan issue. Transparency will help produce a government focused on results instead of our current system, which is plagued by secrecy, wasteful spending and pork projects.&quot;

Then-Senator Barack Obama echoed those sentiments saying, &quot;Every American has the right to know how the government spends their tax dollars, but for too long that information has been largely hidden from public view. This historic law will lift the veil of secrecy in Washington and ensure that our government is transparent and accountable to the American people.&quot;

<text>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) is the United States&#x27; official memorial to the Holocaust. Adjacent to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the USHMM provides for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history. It is dedicated to helping leaders and citizens of the world confront hatred, prevent genocide, promote human dignity, and strengthen democracy.

== Overview ==

In 2008, the museum had an operating budget of $120.6 million. a staff of about 400 employees, 125 contractors, 650 volunteers, 91 Holocaust survivors, and 175,000 members. It had local offices in New York City, Boston, Boca Raton, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas.

Since its dedication on April 22, 1993, the museum has had nearly 40 million visitors, including more than 10 million school children, 99 heads of state, and more than 3,500 foreign officials from over 211 countries and territories. The museum&#x27;s visitors came from all over the world, and less than 10 percent are Jewish. In 2008, its website had 25 million visits, from an average of 100 countries daily. Thirty-five percent of these visits were from outside the United States.

The USHMM&#x27;s collections contain more than 12,750 artifacts, 49 million pages of archival documents, 85,000 historical photographs, a list of over 200,000 registered survivors and their families, 1,000 hours of archival footage, 93,000 library items, and 9,000 oral history testimonies. It also has teacher fellows in every state in the United States and, since 1994, almost 400 university fellows from 26 countries.

Researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have documented 42,500 ghettos and concentration camps created by the Nazis throughout German-controlled areas of Europe from 1933 to 1945.

The museum is located geographically in the same cluster as the Smithsonian museums.

==History==

On November 1, 1978, President Jimmy Carter established the President&#x27;s Commission on the Holocaust, chaired by Elie Wiesel, a prominent author, activist, and Holocaust survivor. Its mandate was to investigate the creation and maintenance of a memorial to victims of the Holocaust and an appropriate annual commemoration to them. The mandate was a joint effort of Wiesel and Richard Krieger (the original papers are on display at the Jimmy Carter Museum). On September 27, 1979, the Commission presented its report to the President, recommending the establishment of a national Holocaust memorial museum in Washington, D.C., with three main components: a national museum/memorial, an educational foundation, and a Committee on Conscience.

After a unanimous vote by the United States Congress in 1980 to establish the museum, the federal government made available of land adjacent to the Washington Monument for construction. Under the founding director Richard Krieger, and subsequent director Jeshajahu Weinberg and chairman Miles Lerman, nearly $190 million was raised from private sources for building design, artifact acquisition, and exhibition creation. In October 1988, President Ronald Reagan helped lay the cornerstone of the building, designed by architect James Ingo Freed. Dedication ceremonies on April 22, 1993, included speeches by American President Bill Clinton, Israeli President Chaim Herzog, Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, and Elie Wiesel. On April 26, 1993, the museum opened to the general public. Its first visitor was the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet.

=== Attacks ===
In 2002, a federal jury convicted white supremacists Leo Felton and Erica Chase of planning to bomb a series of institutions associated with American black and Jewish communities, including the USHMM. 

On June 10, 2009, 88-year-old James von Brunn, an antisemite, shot Museum Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns. Special Police Officer Johns and von Brunn were seriously wounded and transported by ambulance to the George Washington University Hospital. Special Police Officer Johns later died of his injuries; he is permanently honored in an official memorial at the USHMM. Von Brunn, who had a previous criminal record, died before the conclusion of his federal criminal trial, in Butner federal prison in North Carolina.

==Architecture==
Designed by the architect James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, in association with Finegold Alexander &amp; Associates, the USHMM is created to be a &quot;resonator of memory&quot;. (Born to a Jewish family in Germany, Freed came to the United States at the age of nine in 1939 with his parents, who fled the Nazi regime.) The outside of the building disappears into the neoclassical, Georgian, and modern architecture of Washington, D.C. Upon entering, each architectural feature becomes a new element of allusion to the Holocaust. In designing the building, Freed researched post-World War II German architecture and visited Holocaust sites throughout Europe. The Museum building and the exhibitions within are intended to evoke deception, fear, and solemnity, in contrast to the comfort and grandiosity usually associated with Washington, D.C., public buildings.

Other partners in the construction of the USHMM included Weiskopf &amp; Pickworth, Cosentini Associates LLP, Jules Fisher, and Paul Marantz, all from New York City. The structural engineering firm was Severud Associates. The Museum&#x27;s Meyerhoff Theatre and Rubenstein Auditorium were constructed by Jules Fisher Associates of New York City. The Permanent Exhibition was designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates.

==Exhibitions==
The USHMM houses two exhibitions open continuously since 1993 as well as rotating exhibitions on topics related to the Holocaust and human rights.

===Hall of Remembrance===
The Hall of Remembrance is the USHMM&#x27;s official memorial to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Visitors can light candles and view the eternal flame in the hexagonal hall.

===Permanent Exhibition===
Using more than 900 artifacts, 70 video monitors, and four theaters showing historic film footage and eyewitness testimonies, the USHMM&#x27;s Permanent Exhibition is the most visited exhibit at the Museum. Upon entering large industrial elevators on the first floor, visitors are given identification cards, each of which tells the story of a person such as a random victim or survivor of the Holocaust. Upon exiting these elevators on the fourth floor, visitors walk through a chronological history of the Holocaust, starting with the Nazi rise to power led by Adolf Hitler, 1933–1939. Topics dealt with include Aryan ideology, Kristallnacht, antisemitism, and the American response to Nazi Germany. Visitors continue walking to the third floor, where they learn about ghettos and the Final Solutionthe Nazis&#x27;s plan for the genocide of the Jews of Europeduring which the Nazis murdered six million Jews, many in gas chambers. The Permanent Exhibition ends on the second floor with the liberation of Nazi concentration camps by Allied forces; it includes a continuously looped film of Holocaust survivor testimony. First-time visitors spend an average of two to three hours in this self-guided exhibition. Due to certain images and subject matter, it is recommended for visitors 11 years of age and older.

=== Remember the Children: Daniel&#x27;s Story ===
&quot;Remember the Children: Daniel&#x27;s Story&quot; is an exhibition designed to explain the Holocaust to elementary and middle school children. Opened in 1993, it follows true stories about children during the Holocaust. Daniel is named after the son of Isaiah Kuperstein, who was the original curator of the exhibit. He worked together with Ann Lewin and Stan Woodward to create the exhibit. Because of its popularity with families, it is still open to the public today.

=== Stephen Tyrone Johns Memorial ===
In October 2009, the USHMM unveiled a memorial plaque in honor of Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns. In response to the outpouring of grief and support after the shooting on June 10, 2009, it has also established the &quot;Stephen Tyrone Johns Summer Youth Leadership Program&quot;. Each year, 50 outstanding young people from the Washington, D.C. area will be invited to the USHMM to learn about the Holocaust in honor of Johns&#x27; memory.

===A Dangerous Lie (2006)===
&quot;A Dangerous Lie: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; was a special exhibition about the 1903 Russian antisemitic canard, &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. The exhibit was curated by Daniel Greene.

The exhibit explained that in the early 20th century and during Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, it was widely accepted that the &quot;Protocols&quot; documented an actual conspiracy by a small cabal of Jews to control the world for nefarious purposes, and that government and media in some countries continue to promote the &quot;Protocols&quot; as proof that such a Jewish conspiracy to control the world exists. It details the manner in which Henry Ford was responsible for popularizing the fake &quot;Protocols&quot; in his newspaper, The Dearborn Independent.

==Permanent collection==
The Museum&#x27;s holdings included art, books, pamphlets, advertisements, maps, film and video historical footage, audio and video oral testimonies, music and sound recordings, furnishings, architectural fragments, models, machinery, tools, microfilm and microfiche of government documents and other official records, personal effects, personal papers, photographs, photo albums, and textiles. This information can be accessed through online databases or by visiting the USHMM. Researchers from all over the world come to the USHMM Library and Archives and the &quot;Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors&quot;. In March 2024, the museum announced that it acquired the Centropa collection, a collection that contains rare testimonies of Holocaust survivors living in post-war communist countries.

===Museum gallery===
==Financial administration==
The USHMM operates on a mixed federal and private revenue budget. For the 2014–2015 fiscal year, the museum reported total revenues of $133.4 million; $81.9 million and $51.4 million from private and public sources, respectively. Nearly the entirety of private funds come from donations. Expenses totaled of $104.6 million, with a total of $53.5 million used to pay 421 employees. Net assets tallied $436.1 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $319.1 million is classified as long-term investments, including the museum&#x27;s endowment.

==Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies==
In 1998, the museum established the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies (CAHS). Working with the Academic Committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the CAHS supports research projects and publications about the Holocaust (including a partnership with Oxford University Press to publish the scholarly journal &quot;Holocaust and Genocide Studies&quot;), helps make accessible collections of Holocaust-related archival material, supports fellowship opportunities for pre- and post- doctoral researchers, and hosts seminars, summer research workshops for academics, conferences, lectures, and symposia. The CAHS&#x27;s Visiting Scholars Program and other events have made the USHMM one of the world&#x27;s principal venues for Holocaust scholarship.
==Committee on Conscience==
The Museum contains the offices of the Committee on Conscience (CoC), a joint United States government and privately funded think tank, which by presidential mandate engages in global human rights research. Using the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, approved by the United Nations in 1948 and ratified by the United States in 1988, the CoC has established itself as a leading non-partisan commenter on the Darfur genocide, as well as the war-torn region of Chechnya in Russia, a zone that the CoC believes could produce genocidal atrocities. The CoC does not have policy-making powers and serves solely as an advisory institution to the American and other governments.

==National Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust==

In addition to coordinating the National Civic Commemoration, events are held during the week of the Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust on a theme designated each year by the USHMM.

==National Institute for Holocaust Education==
The USHMM conducted several programs devoted to improving Holocaust education. The &quot;Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Conference for Teachers&quot;, conducted in Washington, D.C., attracted around 200 middle school and secondary teachers from around the United States each year. The Education Division offered workshops around the United States for teachers to learn about the Holocaust, to participate in the Museum Teacher Fellowship Program (MTFP), and to join a national corps of educators who served as leaders in Holocaust education in their schools, communities, and professional organizations. Some MTFP participants also participated in the Regional Education Corps, an initiative to implement Holocaust education on a national level.

Since 1999, the USHMM also provided public service professionals, including law enforcement officers, military personnel, civil servants, and federal judges with ethics lessons based in Holocaust history. In partnership with the Anti-Defamation League, more than 21,000 law enforcement officers from worldwide and local law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and local police departments have been trained to act in a professional and democratic manner.

==Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos==

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945&quot; is a seven-part encyclopedia series that explores the history of the concentration camps and the ghettos in German-occupied Europe during the Nazi era. The series is produced by the USHMM and published by the Indiana University Press. The work on the series began in 2000 by the researchers at the USHMM&#x27;s Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies. Its general editor and project directory is the American historian Geoffrey P. Megargee. As of 2017, two volumes have been issued, with the third being planned for 2018.

Volume I covers the early camps that the SA and SS set up in the first year of the Nazi regime, and the camps later run by the SS Economic Administration Main Office and their numerous sub-camps. The volume contains 1,100 entries written by 150 contributors. The bulk of the volume is dedicated to cataloguing the camps, including locations, duration of operation, purpose, perpetrators and victims. Volume II is dedicated to the ghettos in German-occupied Eastern Europe and was published in 2012. In some cases, archival material now housed at the Center has allowed the post-mortem reconstruction of considerable achievements, such as the work of Lodz ghetto artist Melania Fogelbaum and others, which would otherwise have been lost to Nazi extermination and total war terror.

==Outreach ==
Through its online exhibitions, the Museum published the Holocaust Encyclopedia—an online, multilingual encyclopedia detailing the events surrounding the Holocaust. It is published in all six of the official languages of the United Nations—Arabic, Mandarin, English, French, Russian, and Spanish, as well as in Greek, Portuguese, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. It contains thousands of entries and includes copies of the identification card profiles that visitors receive at the Permanent Exhibition. 

The Genocide Prevention Mapping Initiative is a collaboration between the USHMM and Google Earth. It seeks to collect, share, and visually present to the world critical information on emerging crises that may lead to genocide or related crimes against humanity.

==Elie Wiesel Award==
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Award, established in 2011, &quot;recognizes internationally prominent individuals whose actions have advanced the Museum’s vision of a world where people confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.&quot; It has been renamed the Elie Wiesel Award in honor of its first recipient.

==Governance==
The museum is overseen by the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which includes 55 private citizens appointed by the President of the United States, five members of the United States Senate, and five members of the House of Representatives, and three ex-officio members from the Departments of State, Education, and the Interior.

Since the museum opened, the council has been led by the following officers:

*Chairman Elie Wiesel; 1980–1986
*Chairman Harvey M. Meyerhoff; 1987–1993
*Chairman Miles Lerman and Vice Chairman Ruth B. Mandel, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993; through 2000
*Chairman Rabbi Irving Greenberg, appointed by President Clinton in 2000; through 2002
*Chairman Fred S. Zeidman, appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002; and Vice Chairman Joel M. Geiderman, appointed by President Bush in 2005; through 2010
*Chairman Tom A. Bernstein; 2010–2017
*Chairman Howard M. Lorber; 2017–2022
*Chairman Stuart Eizenstat, 2022–present

The council has appointed the following as directors of the museum:

*Jeshajahu Weinberg, 1987–94
*Walter Reich, 1995–98
*Sara J. Bloomfield, 1999–present

==Controversy==
The museum was criticized for refusal to address alleged incidents of genocide in non-Jewish contexts, such as the Syrian civil war. In June 2019, the USHMM took part in a public debate about the inappropriate use of Holocaust-related terminology after U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the detention camps along the southern U.S. border &quot;concentration camps&quot;, and used the phrase &quot;Never Again&quot;. The USHMM published a statement declaring that it &quot;unequivocally rejects efforts to create analogies between the Holocaust and other events, whether historical or contemporary.&quot; A group of historians and scholars responded with an open letter portraying the stance of the museum as &quot;a radical position that is far removed from mainstream scholarship on the Holocaust and genocide.&quot; They claimed it &quot;made learning from the past almost impossible.&quot;

<doc id="553436" wikidata="Q4774835" url="?curid=553436" title="2004 Antiguan general election">
<text>General elections were held in Antigua and Barbuda on 23 March 2004. The result was a victory for the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP), which defeated the incumbent Antigua Labour Party. Baldwin Spencer, leader of the UPP, replaced Lester Bird as Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, with Bird being one of eight Labour MPs to lose his seat. Spencer became only the second Prime Minister from outside the Bird family or the Labour Party.

Bird had been Prime Minister since 1994, when he succeeded his father, Vere Bird, who had been Prime Minister from independence in 1981, having previously served as Chief Minister or Premier of Antigua since 1960 with the exception of the 1971–1976 period.

==Campaign==
The Bird family was widely accused of corruption and nepotism. The &quot;Jamaica Observer&quot; noted that &quot;Bird&#x27;s government had been badly damaged by scandals that in recent years have centred on allegations of bribery, misuse of funds in the national health insurance plan, and a 13-year-old girl&#x27;s charges that he and his brother used her for sex and to procure cocaine. Bird, 72, denied the last charges and organised an inquiry that found no evidence.&quot;

Bird&#x27;s brother, Vere Bird, Jr., was accused of involvement with the Medellin drug cartel in 1989. He lost his Cabinet post, but was not prosecuted.

==Conduct==
An observer team from the Caribbean Community praised the peaceful vote and said the results &quot;clearly reflect the will of the people&quot;. Among recommendations, it urged the Electoral Commission to strengthen its independence. Previous elections in Antigua and Barbuda had been followed by allegations of electoral irregularities favouring the government.

==Results==
The vote in the seat of Barbuda ended in a draw between the Barbuda People&#x27;s Movement, an ally of the UPP, and the Barbuda People&#x27;s Movement for Change, an ally of the ALP, with each candidate receiving 400 votes. A by-election was held on 20 April, which saw Trevor Walker of the BPM elected, with 408 votes against 394 for the BPMC candidate, Arthur Nibbs.

<text>The Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology () commonly known by its acronym BUET, is a public technological research university in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. Founded in 1876 as the Dacca Survey School and gaining university status in 1962, it is the oldest institution for the study of engineering, architecture, and urban planning in the country.

BUET is considered to be the most prestigious university in Bangladesh for science and research. A large number of BUET alumni are active in notable engineering and non-engineering roles in Bangladesh and abroad.

==History==
Dacca Survey School was established in 1876 at Nalgola, west of the current Sir Salimullah Medical College campus, in Old Dhaka by the government of Bengal under British Raj. It offered two-year engineering and survey courses toward the Sub-Overseer&#x27;s examination, which certified land surveyors.

According to a report on public instruction in Bengal, on 31 March 1903, Dhaka Survey School had 117 students of which 103 were Hindus and 14 were Muslims. In 1908, the school started to offer diploma degrees. Nawab Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah, a philanthropist and Nawab of Dhaka, endowed donations for developing the survey school. After his death in 1901, his son, the then Nawab of Dhaka, Sir Khwaja Salimullah released the grant in 1902 in accordance with his late father&#x27;s wish. As an acknowledgement of this contribution, the school was renamed to Ahsanullah School of Engineering in 1908.

The school offered three-year diploma courses in civil engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering in 1908. In 1912, the university was moved to its present premises. In 1938, A. K. Fazlul Huq, the then Prime Minister of Bengal, appointed Hakim Ali as the principal of the school.

After the partition of India in 1947, Chief Minister of East Bengal Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin approved the school to be upgraded to Ahsanullah Engineering College, as a faculty of engineering under the University of Dhaka, offering four-year bachelor&#x27;s course in civil, electrical, mechanical, chemical and metallurgical engineering.

In 1948, the government of East Bengal granted recognition to the engineering college. Ali became the first principal of the college. In 1951, TH Mathewman was appointed the next principal. M. A. Rashid succeeded him in 1954 as the first Bengali principal of the college and held the post until 1960. In 1956, a new course curriculum and the semester system were introduced at the college.

On 1 June 1962, in order to create facilities for postgraduate studies and research, the college was upgraded to East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology (EPUET), becoming the fourth university of the then East Pakistan. Rashid was appointed the first vice-chancellor of the university.

A partnership with the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (renamed Texas A&amp;M University) was forged, and professors from A&amp;M came to teach and formulate the curriculum. During this period, EPUET offered courses in mechanical, electrical, civil, metallurgical, and chemical engineering, and architecture.

After the liberation war of 1971, and Bangladesh&#x27;s independence, EPUET was renamed to Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).

In 2002, a first year student in the chemical engineering department, Sabekun Nahar Sony, was killed during a factional clash between two feuding groups of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) at BUET. The two factions exchanged gunfire and she was caught in the line of fire.
In 2007, BUET celebrated 60 years (1947–2007) of engineering education in Bangladesh by arranging a 6-month-long series of programs and events.

In October 2019, sophomore Abrar Fahad was tortured and beaten to death in Sher-e-Bangla Hall, allegedly by members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the ruling Awami League party. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that beatings and torture by the BCL were common in the dormitories. Fahad&#x27;s murder sparked nearly two months of student protests against violent ragging and bullying at the residence halls. The protests ended after university authorities met student demands. They expelled for life 25 students allegedly involved in the killing, expelled a further 15 from their places in Ahsan Ullah Hall, Suhrawardy Hall, and Titumir Hall, handed down various suspensions and warnings, and adopted new penalties for ragging and political activities.

In February 2021, BUET and Chinese multinational technology company Huawei signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish the first ICT Academy in Bangladesh on BUET campus.

On 21 June 2021, BUET and Saitama University, Japan signed second renewal of the agreement on academic exchange and the memorandum on student exchange between the two institutions. Saitama University (SU) and BUET have had a long-standing relationship for the past 20 years.

In January 2022, BUET was ranked 1st among Bangladeshi and 1589th among global educational institutions in the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities.

<doc id="553460" wikidata="Q860831" url="?curid=553460" title="The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes">
<text>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, first published late in 1893 with 1894 date. It was first published in the UK by G. Newnes Ltd., and was published in the US by Harper &amp; Brothers in February 1894. It was the second collection featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, following &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Like the first it was illustrated by Sidney Paget.

The twelve stories were originally published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; from December 1892 to December 1893 as &quot;The Adventures&quot; number 13 to 24. For instance, &quot;The Final Problem&quot; was published under the subheading &quot;XXIV.—The Adventure of the Final Problem.&quot; In the United States, the stories were first published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly,&quot; except for &quot;The Final Problem,&quot; which appeared in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

Doyle determined that these would be the last Holmes stories, and intended to kill off the character in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Reader demand stimulated him to write another Holmes novel in 1901–1902, &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, set before &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. The next year a new series, &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, begins with the aftermath of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, in which it is revealed that Holmes actually survived.

==Contents==
The sequence of stories matches that of the magazine series, December 1892 to December 1893, when &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot; was published in two parts, October and November.
# &quot;The Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot; – not in the first British edition, nor many other eds.
# &quot;The Adventure of the Yellow Face&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Stockbroker&#x27;s Clerk&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot;
# &quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Reigate Squire&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot; 
# &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot; 
# &quot;The Final Problem&quot;

===Omissions of &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;===
The first London edition of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1894 did not include &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;, although all twelve stories had appeared in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;. The first U.S. edition included the story, but it was very quickly replaced with a revised edition that omitted it. The reasoning behind the suppression is unclear. In Britain the story was apparently removed at Doyle&#x27;s request as it included adultery and so was unsuitable for younger readers. This may have also been the cause for the rapid removal of the story from the U.S. edition, and some sources state that the publishers believed the story was too scandalous for the American public.

As a result, this story was not republished until many years later, when it was added to &quot;His Last Bow&quot;. Today, most American editions of the canon include it with &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, while most British editions keep the story in its original place in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Additionally, when the story was removed from the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, its opening pages, where Holmes emulates Dupin, were transferred to the beginning of &quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot;. In some later U.S. editions of the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, which still omit &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;, this transfer still appears.

==Adaptations==
Several series have included adaptations of all or almost all of the stories in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. All the stories in the collection were adapted as short films for the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series (1921–1923), and as part of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1930–1936). All except &quot;The Yellow Face&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot; were dramatised in the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1939–1950), and all except &quot;The Yellow Face&quot; and &quot;The &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot; were adapted for BBC radio in the Sherlock Holmes 1952–1969 radio series.

Eight of the stories were adapted as episodes of the Granada television series (1984–1994). Only one story, &quot;The Cardboard Box&quot; was adapted for the last part of the series which had the title &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. All the stories in the collection were adapted for BBC Radio 4 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1989–1998 radio series, and all were adapted for the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2005–2016). The individual stories included in the collection have also been adapted for various other productions.

<text>The commissioner of the Northwest Territories () is the Government of Canada&#x27;s representative in the Northwest Territories. Similar in certain functions to a lieutenant governor, the commissioner swears in the members of the legislative assembly, swears in members of the executive council, assents to bills, opens sessions of the legislative assembly, and signs other government documents such as Orders in Council.

Earlier commissioners were mostly deputy ministers in various ministries (Minister of the Interior, Mines, Mines and Resources).

As commissioners are appointed by the Government of Canada, they are not a vice-regal representative in the territory — that is, unlike in Canada&#x27;s provinces, there is no such thing as a &quot;territorial Crown&quot; analogous to the provincial Crowns. The commissioner represents the federal government and must follow any instructions of the Cabinet or the relevant federal minister, currently the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs.

Since 1980, the territories have had self-government, with the legislature choosing a government leader or premier, in addition to electing members of parliament to the Parliament of Canada.

<doc id="553466" wikidata="Q1129378" url="?curid=553466" title="The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes">
<text>The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes is the final set of twelve (out of a total of fifty-six) Sherlock Holmes short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle first published in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; between October 1921 and April 1927.

==Title of collection==
The first British edition of the collection, published by John Murray, and the first American edition, published by George H. Doran Co., were both published in June 1927. However, they had slightly different titles. The title of the British collection was &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (hyphenated &quot;Case-Book&quot;), whereas the title of the American edition was &quot;The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (&quot;Case Book&quot; as two words).

Further confusing the issue of the title, some later publishers released the collection under the title &quot;The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (&quot;Casebook&quot; as a single word).

==Contents==
The first edition of &quot;The Case-Book&quot;, published by John Murray in 1927, does not present the stories in the order in which they were published:
==Copyright history and challenges==
In the United States, two of the short stories from &quot;The Case-Book&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place&quot;, were the last two Sherlock Holmes works by Doyle still protected by copyright. They entered the public domain on 1 January 2023, the year after the 95th anniversary of the stories&#x27; publication. The copyrights expired on 1 January 1981 in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. In the United Kingdom, its copyright was later revived in 1995, expiring again on 1 January 2001.

The Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. claimed they held the American copyrights. The company had a web page setting out its views about other claimants to those rights.

In 2013, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois handed down a ruling about copyright protection, not for the stories themselves, but for the characters of Holmes and Watson. The defendant in the case was Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. The plaintiff was well-known Sherlockian editor, and Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, Leslie S. Klinger. In the case of &quot;Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate Ltd.&quot;, the court ruled that the Holmes and Watson characters as described in the &quot;story elements&quot; that stem from most of the stories—those published before 1924—are in the public domain.

==Literary significance and reception==
Although some of the stories are comparable with Doyle&#x27;s earlier work, this collection is often considered a lesser entry in the Sherlock Holmes canon. Kyle Freeman, author of the introduction to &quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot;, is particularly critical of &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot; and &quot;The Three Gables&quot;, stating that &quot;[a]lmost nothing about either of &#x27;The Mazarin Stone&#x27; or &#x27;The Three Gables&#x27; has the true ring of Conan Doyle&#x27;s style about them.&quot;

Two authors who have written novels using Sherlock Holmes as a character, British writer David Stuart Davies and American author and director Nicholas Meyer have criticised stories from this collection. Davies has commented that &quot;The Creeping Man&quot; &quot;veers towards risible science fiction&quot;. In his 1974 novel &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, Meyer&#x27;s Watson claims that this entry, as well as three others from the &quot;Case-Book&quot; (&quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot;, &quot;The Three Gables&quot; and &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;), are forged &quot;drivel&quot;.

David Timson noted the new era of the 1920s in an introduction to &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;:
&quot;It seems amazing therefore that a new series of Sherlock Holmes stories should have appeared as late as the 1920s. But despite the 1920s being the age of jazz and the flapper, where such items as telephones, electric light, electric bells, motor cars, and gramophones were becoming commonplace, the Holmes phenomenon showed no signs of diminishing. The stories, despite being set for the most part in the early 1900s, were still as eagerly read as ever. Indeed, modern technology was encouraging Holmes&#x27;s popularity. By 1921 the developing silent film industry already had 15 Sherlock Holmes adaptations on its shelves, including a full-length &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. Between 1921 and 1927 Conan Doyle once again returned to his great creation for 12 more stories which were first published in The Strand, and then published collectively as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1927.&quot;

Recognizing that some reviewers have found the short stories in this collection as not like Conan Doyle&#x27;s style, Timson suggests that
&quot;In these stories, Conan Doyle seems to be struggling to find a new narrative style. Nine are related by Watson as the reader would expect, but one is narrated in the third person, and two by Holmes himself. Watson is at pains in the opening narrative to &quot;Thor Bridge&quot; to explain the change: &#x27;In some [cases] I was myself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person.&#x27; ... Conan Doyle’s struggle to ring the changes on what had become for him a tired formula reflected his personal literary journey: he was reluctant to write fiction at all by the 1920s in view of his commitment to spiritualism.&quot;

Three stories of the collection are not narrated by Dr Watson, unlike most Sherlock Holmes stories. &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot; is narrated in the third person, since it was adapted from a stage play in which Watson hardly appeared. &quot;The Blanched Soldier&quot; and &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; are both narrated by Holmes himself, the latter being set after his retirement.

==Adaptations==
Some series have featured adaptations of all the stories in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, including the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1930–1936) and the later radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1939–1950). All but two of the stories in the collection were dramatised for radio as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1952–1969 radio series.

The stories in the collection, except &quot;The Blanched Soldier&quot;, &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, and &quot;The Retired Colourman&quot;, were adapted into episodes of the Granada television series (1984–1994). &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot; and &quot;The Three Garridebs&quot; were combined for one episode, and elements of &quot;The Veiled Lodger&quot; were incorporated into the Granada adaptation of &quot;The Noble Bachelor&quot;. &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 1994–1995 as part of the Sherlock Holmes 1989–1998 radio series. All the stories in the collection were adapted as episodes of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2005–2016). Other adaptations of stories within the collection have also been produced.

<doc id="553468" wikidata="Q212553" url="?curid=553468" title="Melamine">
<text>Melamine is an organic compound with the formula C3H6N6. This white solid is a trimer of cyanamide, with a 1,3,5-triazine skeleton. Like cyanamide, it contains 66% nitrogen by mass, and its derivatives have fire-retardant properties due to its release of nitrogen gas when burned or charred. Melamine can be combined with formaldehyde and other agents to produce melamine resins. Such resins are characteristically durable thermosetting plastic used in high–pressure decorative laminates such as Formica, melamine dinnerware including cooking utensils, plates, and plastic products, laminate flooring, and dry erase boards. Melamine foam is used as insulation and soundproofing material, and in polymeric cleaning products such as Magic Eraser.

Melamine-formaldehyde resin tableware was evaluated by the Taiwan Consumers&#x27; Foundation to have 20,000 parts per billion of free melamine that could migrate out of the plastic into acidic foods if held at for two hours, such as if food were kept heated in contact with it in an oven. 

Melamine gained infamy because Chinese food producers Sanlu Group added it to baby formula in order to increase the apparent protein content, causing the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. Ingestion of melamine may lead to reproductive damage, or bladder or kidney stones, and bladder cancer. It is also an irritant when inhaled or in contact with the skin or eyes. The United Nations&#x27; food standards body, the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; Commission, has set the maximum amount of melamine allowed in powdered infant formula to 1 mg/kg and the amount of the chemical allowed in other foods and animal feed to 2.5 mg/kg. While not legally binding, the levels allow countries to ban importation of products with excessive levels of melamine.

== Etymology ==
The German word &quot;Melamin&quot; was coined by combining the words melam (a derivative of ammonium thiocyanate) and amine. Melamine is, therefore, unrelated etymologically to the root (, meaning &#x27;black&#x27; in Greek), from which the words melanin, a pigment, and melatonin, a hormone, are formed.

== Uses ==

=== Plastics and building materials ===
In one large-scale application, melamine is combined with formaldehyde and other agents to produce melamine resins. Such resins are characteristically durable thermosetting plastic used in high-pressure decorative laminates such as Wilsonart, melamine dinnerware, laminate flooring, and dry erase boards. Melamine cookware is not microwave-safe, and can be identified from the fact it is &quot;slightly heavier and noticeably thicker than its plastic counterparts.&quot;

Melamine foam is used as insulation, soundproofing material and in polymeric cleaning products, such as Magic Eraser.

Melamine is one of the major components in Pigment Yellow 150, a colorant in inks and plastics.

Melamine also is used in the fabrication of melamine polysulfonate, used as a superplasticizer for making high-resistance concrete. Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as a cement admixture to reduce the water content in concrete while increasing the fluidity and the workability of the mix during handling and pouring. It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime.

=== Fertilizers ===
Melamine was once envisioned as fertilizer for crops during the 1950s and 1960s because of its high (66% by mass) nitrogen content. However, melamine is much more expensive to produce than other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea. The mineralization (degradation to ammonia) for melamine is slow, making this product both economically and scientifically impractical for use as a fertilizer.
=== Fire-retardant additives ===
Melamine and its salts are used as fire-retardant additives in paints, plastics, and paper. A melamine fiber, Basofil, has low thermal conductivity, excellent flame resistance and is self-extinguishing; this makes it useful for flame-resistant protective clothing, either alone or as a blend with other fibres.

=== Food additive ===
Melamine is sometimes illegally added to food products in order to increase the apparent protein content. Standard tests, such as the Kjeldahl and Dumas tests, estimate protein levels by measuring the nitrogen content, so they can be misled by the addition of nitrogen-rich, but non-proteinaceous compounds such as melamine. There are instruments available today that can differentiate melamine nitrogen from protein nitrogen.

=== Medicine ===
Melamine derivatives of arsenical drugs are potentially important in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis.

Melamine use as non-protein nitrogen (NPN) for cattle was described in a 1958 patent. In 1978, however, a study concluded that melamine &quot;may not be an acceptable non-protein N source for ruminants&quot; because its hydrolysis in cattle is slower and less complete than other nitrogen sources such as cottonseed meal and urea.

== Toxicity ==
The short-term lethal dose of melamine is on a par with common table salt, with an LD50 of more than 3 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists explained that when melamine and cyanuric acid are absorbed into the bloodstream, they concentrate and interact in the urine-filled renal tubules, then crystallize and form large numbers of round, yellow crystals, which in turn block and damage the renal cells that line the tubes, causing the kidneys to malfunction and lead to kidney stones, kidney failure, and death. Signs of melamine toxicity can include irritability, blood in the urine, little to no urine, symptoms of kidney infection, or high blood pressure.

The European Union set a standard for acceptable human consumption (tolerable daily intake or TDI) of melamine at 0.2 mg per kilogram of body mass (previously 0.5 mg/kg), Canada declared a limit of 0.35 mg/kg, and the US FDA&#x27;s limit was put at 0.063 mg/kg (previously 0.63 mg/kg). The World Health Organization&#x27;s food safety director estimated that the amount of melamine a person could stand per day without incurring a bigger health risk, the TDI, was 0.2 mg per kilogram of body mass.

Toxicity of melamine can be mediated by intestinal microbiota. In culture, &quot;Raoultella terrigena&quot;, which rarely colonizes mammalian intestines, was shown to convert melamine to cyanuric acid directly. Rats colonized by R&quot;. terrigena&quot; showed greater melamine-induced kidney damage compared to those not colonized.

=== Acute toxicity ===
Melamine is reported to have an oral median lethal dose (LD50) of 3248 mg/kg based on rat data. It is also an irritant when inhaled or in contact with the skin or eyes. The reported dermal LD50 is greater than 1000 mg/kg for rabbits. A study by Soviet researchers in the 1980s suggested that melamine cyanurate, commonly used as a fire retardant, could be more toxic than either melamine or cyanuric acid alone. For rats and mice, the reported LD50 for melamine cyanurate was 4.1 g/kg (given inside the stomach) and 3.5 g/kg (via inhalation), compared to 6.0 and 4.3 g/kg for melamine and 7.7 and 3.4 g/kg for cyanuric acid respectively.

A toxicology study in animals conducted after recalls of contaminated pet food concluded that the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in diet does lead to acute kidney injury in cats. A 2008 study produced similar experimental results in rats and characterized the melamine and cyanuric acid in contaminated pet food from the 2007 outbreak. A 2010 study from Lanzhou University attributed kidney failure in humans to uric acid stone accumulation after ingestion of melamine resulting in a rapid aggregation of metabolites such as cyanuric acid diamide (ammeline) and cyanuric acid. A 2013 study demonstrated that melamine can be metabolized to cyanuric acid by gut bacteria. In particular, &quot;Klebsiella terrigena&quot; was determined to be a factor in melamine toxicity. In culture, &quot;K. terrigena&quot; was shown to convert melamine to cyanuric acid directly. Cyanuric acid was detected in the kidneys of rats administered melamine alone, and the concentration after Klebsiella colonization was increased.

=== Chronic toxicity ===
Ingestion of melamine may lead to reproductive damage, or bladder or kidney stones, which can lead to bladder cancer.

A study in 1953 reported that dogs fed 3% melamine for a year had the following changes in their urine: (1) reduced specific gravity, (2) increased output, (3) melamine crystalluria, and (4) protein and occult blood.

A survey commissioned by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians suggested that crystals formed in the kidneys when melamine combined with cyanuric acid, &quot;don&#x27;t dissolve easily. They go away slowly, if at all, so there is the potential for chronic toxicity.&quot;

===Metabolism===
Melamine is a metabolite of cyromazine, a pesticide. It has been reported that cyromazine can also be converted to melamine in plants.

=== Treatment of urolithiasis ===
Fast diagnosis and treatment of acute obstructive urolithiasis may prevent the development of acute kidney failure. Urine alkalinization and stone liberalization have been reported to be the most effective treatments in humans.

== Regulation in food and feed ==
The United Nations&#x27; food standards body, Codex Alimentarius Commission, has set the maximum amount of melamine allowed in powdered infant formula to 1 mg/kg and the amount of the chemical allowed in other foods and animal feed to 2.5 mg/kg. While not legally binding, the levels allow countries to ban importation of products with excessive levels of melamine.

== Synthesis and reactions==
Melamine was first synthesized by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1834. In early production, first calcium cyanamide was converted into dicyandiamide, which was heated above its melting temperature to produce melamine. Today most industrial manufacturers use urea in the following reaction to produce melamine:

In the first step, urea decomposes into cyanic acid and ammonia:
Cyanic acid polymerizes to cyanuric acid, which condenses with the liberated ammonia forming melamine. The released water reacts with cyanic acid, which helps to drive the reaction:
The above reaction can be carried out by either of two methods: catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production. In one method, molten urea is introduced onto a fluidized bed with catalyst for reaction. Hot ammonia gas is also present to fluidize the bed and inhibit deammonization. The effluent then is cooled. Ammonia and carbon dioxide in the off-gas are separated from the melamine-containing slurry. The slurry is further concentrated and crystallized to yield melamine. Major manufacturers and licensors such as Orascom Construction Industries, BASF, and Eurotecnica have developed some proprietary methods.

The off-gas contains large amounts of ammonia. Therefore, melamine production is often integrated into urea production, which uses ammonia as feedstock.

Crystallization and washing of melamine generates a considerable amount of waste water, which may be concentrated into a solid (1.5–5% of the weight) for easier disposal. The solid may contain approximately 70% melamine, 23% oxytriazines (ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid), 0.7% polycondensates (melem, melam, and melon). In the Eurotecnica process, however, there is no solid waste and the contaminants are decomposed to ammonia and carbon dioxide and sent as off gas to the upstream urea plant; accordingly, the waste water can be recycled to the melamine plant itself or used as clean cooling water make-up.

Melamine reacts with acid and related compounds to form melamine cyanurate and related crystal structures, which have been implicated as contaminants or biomarkers in Chinese protein adulterations.

==Drug derivatives==
Melamine is part of the core structure for a number of drugs including almitrine, altretamine, cyromazine, ethylhexyl triazone, iscotrizinol, meladrazine, melarsomine, melarsoprol, tretamine, trinitrotriazine, and others.

== Production in mainland China ==
Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, both consumption and production of melamine grew considerably in mainland China. By early 2006, melamine production in mainland China is reported to be in &quot;serious surplus&quot;.
Between 2002 and 2007, while the global melamine price remained stable, a steep increase in the price of urea (feedstock for melamine) has reduced the profitability of melamine manufacturing. Currently, China is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of melamine, while its domestic consumption still grows by 10% per year. However, reduced profit has already caused other joint melamine ventures to be postponed there.

Surplus melamine has been an adulterant for feedstock and milk in mainland China for several years now because it can make diluted or poor quality material appear to be higher in protein content by elevating the total nitrogen content detected by some simple protein tests. Actions taken in 2008 by the Government of China have reduced the practice of adulteration, with the goal of eliminating it. As a result of the Chinese milk scandal, court trials began in December 2008 for six people involved in adding melamine in food products, ending in January 2009 with two of the convicts being sentenced to death and executed.

== Melamine poisoning by tainted food ==
Melamine has been involved in several food recalls after the discovery of severe kidney damage to children and pets poisoned by melamine-adulterated food.

=== 2007 animal-feed recalls ===
In 2007, a pet food recall was initiated by Menu Foods and other pet food manufacturers who had found their products had been contaminated and caused serious illnesses or deaths in some of the animals that had eaten them. In March 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration reported finding white granular melamine in the pet food, in samples of white granular wheat gluten imported from a single source in China, Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology as well as in crystalline form in the kidneys and in urine of affected animals. Further vegetable protein imported from China was later implicated.

In April 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the addition of &quot;melamine scrap&quot; into fish and livestock feed to give the false appearance of a higher level of protein was an &quot;open secret&quot; in many parts of mainland China, reporting that this melamine scrap was being produced by at least one plant processing coal into melamine. Four days later, the New York Times reported that, despite the widely reported ban on melamine use in vegetable proteins in mainland China, at least some chemical manufacturers continued to report selling it for use in animal feed and in products for human consumption. Li Xiuping, a manager at Henan Xinxiang Huaxing Chemical in Henan Province, stated, &quot;Our chemical products are mostly used for additives, not for animal feed. Melamine is mainly used in the chemical industry, but it can also be used in making cakes.&quot; Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group, the company reported by the New York Times as producing melamine from coal, produces and sells both urea and melamine but does not list melamine resin as a product.

Another recall incident in 2007 involved melamine which had been purposely added as a binder to fish and livestock feed manufactured in the United States. This was traced to suppliers in Ohio and Colorado.

=== 2008 Chinese outbreak ===

In September 2008, several companies, including Nestlé, were implicated in a scandal involving milk and infant formula which had been adulterated with melamine, leading to kidney stones and other kidney failure, especially among young children. By December 2008, nearly 300,000 people had become ill, with more than 50,000 infant hospitalizations and six infant deaths. In a study published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, it was reported that melamine exposure increased the incidence of urinary tract stones by seven times in children. Melamine may have been added to fool government protein content tests after water was added to fraudulently dilute the milk. Because of melamine&#x27;s high nitrogen content (66% by mass versus approximately 10–12% for typical protein), it can cause the protein content of food to appear higher than the true value. Officials estimate that about 20% of the dairy companies tested in China sell products tainted with melamine. On January 22, 2009, three of those involved in the scandal (including one conditional sentence) were sentenced to death in a Chinese court.

In October 2008, &quot;Select Fresh Brown Eggs&quot; exported to Hong Kong from the Hanwei Group in Dalian in northeastern China were found to be contaminated with nearly twice the legal limit of melamine. York Chow, the health secretary of Hong Kong, said he thought animal feeds might be the source of the contamination and announced that the Hong Kong Centre for Food Safety would henceforward be testing all mainland Chinese pork, farmed fish, animal feed, chicken meat, eggs, and offal products for melamine.

As of July 2010, Chinese authorities were still reporting some seizures of melamine-contaminated dairy product in some provinces, though it was unclear whether these new contaminations constituted wholly new adulterations or were the result of illegal reuse of material from the 2008 adulterations.

On characterization and treatment of urinary stones in affected infants, &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; printed an editorial in March 2009, along with reports on cases from Beijing, Hong Kong and Taipei.

Urinary calculi specimens were collected from 15 cases treated in Beijing and were analyzed as unknown objects for their components at Beijing Institute of Microchemistry using infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and high performance liquid chromatography. The result of the analysis showed that the calculus was composed of melamine and uric acid, and the molecular ratio of uric acid to melamine was around 2:1.

In a 2009 study of 683 children diagnosed in Beijing in 2008 with nephrolithiasis and 6,498 children without nephrolithiasis aged &lt; 3 years, investigators found that in children exposed to melamine levels &lt; 0.2 mg/kg per day, the risk for nephrolithiasis was 1.7 times higher than in those without melamine exposure, suggesting that the risk of melamine-induced nephrolithiasis in young children starts at a lower intake level than the levels recommended by the World Health Organization.

In a study published in 2010, researchers from Beijing University studying ultrasound images of infants who fell ill in the 2008 contamination found that while most children in a rural Chinese area recovered, 12 per cent still showed kidney abnormalities six months later. &quot;The potential for long-term complications after exposure to melamine remains a serious concern,&quot; the report said. &quot;Our results suggest a need for further follow-up of affected children to evaluate the possible long-term impact on health, including renal function.&quot; Another 2010 follow-up study from Lanzhou University attributed the uric acid stone accumulation after ingestion of melamine to a rapid aggradation of metabolites such as cyanuric acid diamide (ammeline) and cyanuric acid and reported that urine alkalinization and stone liberalization were the most effective treatments.

Until the 2007 pet food recalls, melamine had not routinely been monitored in food, except in the context of plastic safety or insecticide residue.

Following the deaths of children in China from powdered milk in 2008, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in Belgium set up a website about methods to detect melamine. In May 2009, the JRC published the results of a study that benchmarked the ability of labs around the world to accurately measure melamine in food. The study concluded that the majority of labs can effectively detect melamine in food.

In October 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new methods for the analysis of melamine and cyanuric acid in infant formulations in the Laboratory Information Bulletin No 4421. Similar recommendations have been issued by other authorities, like the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, both based on liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC/MS) detection after hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation.

The existing methods for melamine determination using a triple quadrupole liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC/MS) after solid phase extraction (SPE) are often complex and time-consuming. However, electrospray ionization methods coupled with mass spectrometry allow a rapid and direct analysis of samples with complex matrices: the native liquid samples are directly ionized under ambient conditions in their original solution. In December 2008, two new fast and inexpensive methods for detecting melamine in liquids have been published.

Ultrasound-assisted extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EESI-MS) has been developed at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) by Zhu, Chingin et al., (2008) for a rapid detection of melamine in untreated food samples. Ultrasounds are used to nebulize the melamine-containing liquids into a fine spray. The spray is then ionised by extractive electrospray ionisation (EESI) and analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). An analysis requires 30 seconds per sample. The limit of detection of melamine is a few nanograms of melamine per gram of milk.

Huang et al. (2008) have also developed at Purdue University (US) a simpler instrumentation and a faster method by using a low-temperature plasma probe to ionize the samples. The major obstacles being solved, the ESI-MS technique allows now high-throughput analysis of melamine traces in complex mixtures.

The Melaminometer
was a hypothetical design for a synthetic biology circuit, to be used for detecting melamine and related chemical analogues such as cyanuric acid. The conceptual project is hosted at OpenWetWare as open source biology in collaboration with DIYbio and has been discussed in various newspapers in the context of homebrew biotechnology. As of October 2009, the design has not been verified.

Because melamine resin is often used in food packaging and tableware, melamine at ppm level (1 part per million) in food and beverage has been reported due to migration from melamine-containing resins. Small amounts of melamine have also been reported in foodstuff as a metabolite product of cyromazine, an insecticide used on animals and crops.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a test method for analyzing cyromazine and melamine in animal tissues. In 2007, the FDA began using a high performance liquid chromatography test to determine the melamine, ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid contamination in food. Another procedure is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

Member states of the European Union are required under Commission Decision 2008/757/EC to ensure that all composite products containing at least 15% of milk product, originating from China, are systematically tested before import into the Community and that all such products which are shown to contain melamine in excess of 2.5 mg/kg are immediately destroyed.

==Detection in biological specimens==
The presence of melamine in urine specimens from children who consumed adulterated milk products has been determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

== Melamine on metal surfaces ==
It is reported that melamine molecules adsorbed on gold or silver surface tend to arrange into honeycomb or closed-packed structures. Such a self-assembly occurs due to the inter-molecular hydrogen bond interaction. This ordering was further investigated using classical Monte Carlo and DFT methods.

<doc id="553469" wikidata="Q401053" url="?curid=553469" title="Grumman F-9 Cougar">
<text>The Grumman F9F/F-9 Cougar is a carrier-based jet-powered fighter aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Grumman.

It was developed during the early 1950s on behalf of the United States Navy (US Navy) and United States Marine Corps (USMC), which were keen to quickly introduce a naval fighter equipped with a swept wing. Grumman&#x27;s design team decided to adapt its earlier F9F Panther, replacing the straight wing of the Panther with a new swept wing. Thrust was also increased with the installation of a newer and more powerful engine. Nevertheless, the aircraft remained limited to subsonic speeds. The first prototype (XF9F-6), which was produced by modifying an existing Panther, performed its maiden flight on 20 September 1951. The Navy considered the Cougar to be an updated version of the Panther, despite having a different official name, and thus Cougars started off from F9F-6.

During December 1952, the F9F-6 was introduced to service, VF-32 being the first squadron to receive the type; while developed at a relatively rapid pace, the Cougar&#x27;s arrival was too late for it to engage in active combat during the Korean War. While initial production aircraft were powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney J48 turbojet engine, the F9F-7 were furnished by an Allison J33 powerplant instead. In the mid 1950s, the improved F9F-8 was introduced, which had a lower stall speed, improved handling when flown at high angles of attack, and increased range. The twin-seat F9F-8T was procured by the US Navy to perform various forms of training. The F9F-8P photo-reconnaissance variant was created by converting existing F9F-8s; most of the modifications were made to the aircraft&#x27;s nose.

On 1 April 1954, US Navy Cougars established a new transcontinental crossing record. The US Navy&#x27;s flight demonstration team, the Blue Angels, adopted the type in place of its Panthers. The Cougar gained a favourable reputation as a highly maneuverable and easy to fly aircraft. The only foreign air service that operated the Cougar was the Argentine Naval Aviation. The F9F-8 was withdrawn from front-line duties during the late 1950s, having been replaced by more capable aircraft such as the F11F Tigers and F8U Crusaders. While the Naval Reserves flew Cougars into the mid-1960s, only the TF-9J trainer model saw actual combat, having been deployed as a Forward Air Control aircraft during the Vietnam War. Following its withdrawal from active service, many F9F-6s were used as unmanned drones for combat training, designated F9F-6D, or as drone controllers, designated F9F-6K.

==Design and development==
===Early development===
Rumors that the Soviet Union had produced a swept wing fighter had circulated a year before the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 first appeared at air shows in 1949. Despite the level of activity taking place with swept wing aircraft, the US Navy was not initially focused on the development of such aircraft. This was largely because the US Navy&#x27;s focus at the time was defending the battle group against high speed, high altitude bombers with interceptors, as well as escorting medium-range carrier-based bombers in all weather conditions; air-to-air combat was of less interest at that time. Nonetheless, the US Navy appreciated the importance of getting a capable carrier-based swept wing jet fighter. Grumman was awarded a contract for the development of a swept-wing fighter jet in early 1951. The arrival of the MiG-15, which easily outclassed straight-wing fighters in the air war over North Korea, was a major factor.

Development proceeded at a relatively rapid pace, in part due to Grumman&#x27;s pre-existing experience of studying prospective derivatives of the Panther guiding several of their design choices. One example of this was the design team&#x27;s decision to retain the center fuselage section of the Panther relatively unchanged, as studies of various alternative arrangements had been determined to have introduced center of gravity issues that in turn would have compelled substantial redesigns of other elements of the aircraft, including its propulsion. Instead, the aircraft shared the Panther&#x27;s engine, landing gear, and various other systems. By changing as little as possible, the company was able to produce a swept wing fighter for the US Navy in mere months, rather than the years involved in delivering a clean-sheet design.

However, it was necessary to implement various design changes. To effectively accommodate the switch from a straight wing to a swept one, it was necessary to delete the two 120-gallon tip tanks, as in combination with the swept wing there would have been too great a negative impact upon the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity; for the same reason, only a single hardpoint was fitted under each wing. Instead, internal fuel tanks housed within the wing were adopted, although these had less capacity than the tip tanks had. The leading edge flaps present on the Panther were deleted in favour of a slats, while the trailing edge slats and fuselage-mounted flaps were both redesigned to be effective with the swept wing. The modified fuselage flaps could also function as a second set of air brakes.

===Early flights===

Three &quot;XF9F-6&quot; prototypes, two airworthy and one static test airframe, were rapidly produced by modifying existing Panthers straight off the production line. On 20 September 1951, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Grumman test pilot Fred Rowley, only six months following the contract&#x27;s awarding. Few meaningful problems were encountered during flight testing, most being quickly resolved or accepted on the basis of the perceived urgency for such an aircraft to be made available. The Cougar proved itself to be a definitive step forward; some pilots claimed the type to have superior handling at approach speeds than the preceding Panther. In a full-power vertical dive, it could break the sound barrier without experiencing buffeting or major undesirable flight characteristics. In level flight, the aircraft remained only capable of subsonic flight, however, the critical Mach number was increased from 0.79 to 0.86 at sea level, and to 0.895 at 35,000 ft (10,000 m), thus delivering markedly improved performance than its predecessor.

However, both roll and pitch control were deemed to not satisfy the requirements. The original roll control arrangement, a combination of unboosted ailerons and hydraulically-actuated spoilers (referred to as &quot;flaperons&quot;), were insufficient when operated via mechanical linkage alone without hydraulic pressure, thus were redesigned. Wing fences were added and the spoilers extended from the fences to the tips of the wing, while the flaperons were divided into two halves, the inbound set being powered by a separate hydraulic system.

Pitch control was initially achieved via a conventional elevator and horizontal stabilizer, the rudder pedals controlled the section of the rudder beneath the horizontal tail surface, while the upper portion of the rudder was controlled by a yaw damper. However, this arrangement was unsuited to high speed flight, thus a powered &quot;flying tail&quot; was adopted. As such, the Cougar was capable of flying safely and easily even without the upper portion of the tail being present.

===F9F-6===
The initial production model was the &quot;F9F-6&quot;; a total of 646 airframes were delivered between mid-1952 and July 1954. The F9F-6 first flew on 20 September 1951, seven months after Grumman signed a contract with the Navy for swept-wing fighter. The first 30 production aircraft used the same J42 P-6 engine used in the F9F-5, but was then replaced by the more powerful J42 P-8 with of thrust. The J42 was a licensed version of the Rolls-Royce Nene.

Armament was four 20 mm (.79 in) AN/M3 cannons in the nose and provisions for two bombs or drop tanks under the wings. Most were fitted with a UHF homing antenna under the nose, and some were fitted with probes for inflight refuelling. The F9F-6 used an Aero 5D-1 weapons sight with an APG-30A gun-ranging radar. The F9F-6 was later designated F-9F in 1962. Sixty were built as F9F-6P reconnaissance aircraft with cameras instead of the nose cannon.

After withdrawal from active service, many F9F-6s were used as unmanned drones for combat training, designated F9F-6D, or as drone controllers, designated F9F-6K. The F9F-6K and the F9F-6D were redesignated the QF-9F and DF-9F, respectively.

===F9F-7===
The F9F-7 referred to the next batch of Cougars that were given the Allison J33 also found in the F9F-4, instead of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J48. A total of 168 were built, but the J33 proved both less powerful and less reliable than the J48. Almost all were retrofitted with the J48 engine, and were thus indistinguishable from F9F-6s. These were redesignated F-9H in 1962.

====Flexible deck testing====
The Navy used two modified F9F-7s to conduct experiments landing on British-inspired flexible decks which did not require the use of landing gear. The reasoning was that since an airplane&#x27;s landing gear comprises some 33% of the total weight, a plane without landing gear would gain a greater range and would be able to carry more ordnance. The aircraft were fitted with a false bottom under the center fuselage to help balance the plane during landings on the flex-deck made up of a lubricated rubberized fabric. The deck, built by Goodyear was thick and featured several arresting cables. The planes were launched using a ramp and a handling dolly which served as temporary landing gear. The two F9F-7 aircraft in the test were equipped with the powerful J48-P8 engine instead of the Allison J33 engine originally used with the F9F-7. While the landing tests yielded positive results and proved that landing was clearly possible, the project was terminated in 1955 as it would have been difficult to move the aircraft around the carrier deck once they landed. It also required a highly skilled pilot to perform the landings and would have made it impossible to divert to a land base if necessary.

===F9F-8===
Work on the F9F-8 began in April 1953 with three goals: lower the airplane&#x27;s stall speed, improve aircraft control at high angles of attack, and increase range. It featured an 8 in (20 cm) stretch in the fuselage and modified wings with a greater chord, an increased area (from ), and a dogtooth. The airframe changes improved low-speed and high angle of attack flying, and gave more room for fuel tanks. The top speed was and minimum catapult speed was lowered to . It also was now capable of breaking the sound barrier in a steep dive. All four ammunition boxes were mounted above the guns, in contrast to the split location of most previous F9Fs including the Panther. Visibility, which was already very good was improved with the F9F-8. 601 aircraft were delivered between April 1954 and March 1957. Late production F9F-8 aircraft were given the ability to carry four AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles under the wings (the first Navy aircraft to deploy with the missiles). Most earlier aircraft were later modified to carry Sidewinders. A number were given also nuclear bombing equipment. The F9F-8 was redesignated F-9J in 1962. The F9F-8B aircraft were F9F-8s converted into single-seat attack fighters, later redesignated AF-9J. The Navy acquired 377 two-seat F9F-8T trainers between 1956 and 1960. They were used for advanced training, weapons training, and carrier training, and served until 1974. They were armed with twin 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and could carry a full bombs or missiles load. In the 1962 redesignation, these were later called TF-9J.

====Aerial reconnaissance====
A total of 110 F9F-8Ps (photo-reconnaissance) were produced with an extensively modified nose carrying cameras. They were withdrawn after 1960 to reserve squadrons. In 1962, remaining F9F-6P and F9F-8P aircraft were re-designated RF-9F and RF-9J respectively.

Modifications of F9F-8 to convert to F9F-8P:
* The modification to eliminate the guns and related equipment and incorporate the photographic equipment and automatic pilot and their controls and instruments has resulted in the following changes:
* Rearrangement of electronics equipment installed in the area enclosed by the fuselage nose section, lengthening of this section by , and shortening of the sliding nose section.
* Rearrangement of the left and right consoles and the main instrument panel to provide space for the controls associated with the additional equipment.
* Some minor changes of the fuselage structure and equipment installations to provide for the necessary ducting control for hot air from the engine compressor, which is used for defrosting the camera windows and heating the camera compartment.
* Removal of all armament, the Armament Control System, and the AN/APG-30 radar system, and installation of an additional armor plate bulkhead.

===Flight characteristics and deployment===
The F9F was known to be highly maneuverable and easy to fly. Corky Meyer, who flew both the F9F Cougar and North American FJ-3 Fury, noted that compared to the latter the Cougar had a higher dive speed limit (Mach 1.2 vs Mach 1), a higher maneuvering limit of 7.5-g (compared to 6-g), and greater endurance.

&quot;[The] Combat Air patrol mission was for two hours on station at from the carrier. This required 2+30 takeoff, cruise, and landing endurance plus reserves. The F9F-6 could perform a three-hour CAP mission on internal fuel. The FJ-2 and -3 with external tanks had less than 1+30 mission time and the FJ-4 just met the mission requirement.&quot;

The F9F Cougar was also a capable multi-role aircraft, which may explain why it was deployed less often than dedicated fighters. In spite of engine problems that plagued the FJ-3, it was deployed for a longer period than the F9F Cougar. This was more likely attributable to the fact the F9F had an attack role that was being superseded by new jets such as A4D-1 Skyhawk, rather than any deficiency as a fighter.

&quot;The reason the FJ-3 was deployed a little longer and a little more often (19 times vs 16) in fighter squadrons than the F9F-8 probably wasn&#x27;t because it was the better fighter. More likely it was because it has a minimal capability as an attack aircraft, whereas the F9F-8 was good for that too, including nuclear weapon delivery. In effect the F9F-8 was a jet attack placeholder along with the F7U-3M, while the pipeline was being filled with the FJ-4Bs and A4Ds. As a result, the FJ-3 was the designated day fighter by default on most deployments.&quot;

==Operational history==

===United States===
The first F9F-6s were assigned to fleet squadron VF-32 at the end of 1952. The first F9F Cougar squadron to actually deploy was VF-24, assigned to in August 1953. It arrived too late to the Korean theater to participate in the air war.

F9F-8s were withdrawn from front-line service in 1958–59, replaced by F11F Tigers and F8U Crusaders. The Naval Reserves used them until the mid-1960s, but none of the single-seat versions were used in the Vietnam War.

The only version of the Cougar to see combat was the TF-9J trainer (known as F9F-8T until 1962) during the Vietnam War. Detachments of four Cougars served with US Marines Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 11 (H&amp;MS-11) at Da Nang and H&amp;MS-13 at Chu Lai, where they were used for fast-Forward Air Control and the airborne command role, directing airstrikes against enemy positions in South Vietnam between 1966 and 1968.

The TF-9J two-seat trainer had a long service with the U.S. Navy. It served as the Navy&#x27;s advanced flight trainer for more than two decades. The proposed Cougar modification (re-engined with a J52 engine) was rejected, and the Navy selected the TA-4F Skyhawk. The last Cougar was phased out when Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) re-equipped in February 1974. A F9F-8T, BuNo 14276, is displayed at the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida.

====Transcontinental speed record====
The US Navy used the F9F Cougar to set the transcontinental crossing record on April 1, 1954. Three pilots from fleet fighter squadron VF-21 completed the flight in under four hours with LCDR F.X. Brady setting the quickest time of 3 hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds. This was the first time the distance had been covered in under four hours. The three F9F-6 aircraft refueled over Kansas from a North American AJ Savage, using an experimental refueling probe mounted on the nose.

====Blue Angels====
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s flight demonstration team, the Blue Angels flew four different variants of F9Fs from the F9F-2 Panther to the F9F-8. The Blue Angels replaced their six F9F-5 Panthers with six F9F-6s in 1953. This was short lived however and the Navy subsequently took them for fleet use without using the planes in an air show. The F9F-6s were then replaced with overhauled F9F-5s until 1954 when the Blue Angels switched to the F9F-8. The Blue Angels used the F9F-8 until 1957 they were replaced by the Grumman F11F-1 Tiger, although one two-seat F9F-8T was retained for press and VIP flights.

===Argentina===
The only foreign air arm to use the F9F Cougar was the Argentine Naval Aviation, who also used the F9F Panther as well. Two F9F-8T trainers were acquired in 1962, and served until 1971. The Cougar was the first jet to break the sound barrier in Argentina. One aircraft (serial 3-A-151) is on display at the Naval Aviation Museum (MUAN) at Bahía Blanca, while the other was sold to a customer in the United States and subsequently lost in an accident on 31 October 1991.

<text>Major Ralph Lowell (July 23, 1890 – May 15, 1978) was a World War I veteran, banker, and philanthropist from Boston.

Lowell was born in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, to John and Mary Emlen Lowell (Lowell 1899, p 302). Lowell graduated from Harvard College in 1912. He married Charlotte Loring (1897–1981) on September 1, 1917.

==Career==
Ralph Lowell chose to pursue a career in banking and finance, as his family had a long history in business and banking in Boston. He eventually became president of the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. And in 1955, Ralph received an LL.D. from Bates College.

==Philanthropist==
Lowell was appointed as the sole Trustee of the Lowell Institute, in 1943, upon the death of his cousin, Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell. Lowell would serve as Trustee of the Lowell Institute for the rest of his life and named his son, John Lowell, to succeed him.

In cooperation with another Harvard President, James B. Conant, Lowell used his position at the Institute to help found the WGBH radio and television stations. He served as president on the board of the WGBH Educational Foundation from 1951 into the 1970s.

;Grand Bostonian
:&quot;In 1973, Lowell was one of seven citizens officially recognized as &#x27;Grand Bostonians&#x27; for lives that &#x27;mirrored the spirit and dignity that have made Boston and its people so extraordinary.&#x27; The years of Lowell&#x27;s philanthropic and civic works paralleled significant transformations in the political, social, and cultural landscape of Boston, and his remarkable achievements reflect his key role in the making of a &#x27;New Boston&#x27; during the mid-twentieth century.&quot; (Gelfand 1998)

Lowell died in Boston on May 15, 1978, of pneumonia at the age of eighty-seven and was buried in the Old Westwood Cemetery in Westwood, Massachusetts.

<doc id="553487" wikidata="Q1846692" url="?curid=553487" title="Formica (plastic)">
<text>Formica is a laminated composite material invented at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States in 1912. Originally used to replace mica in electrical applications, it has since been manufactured for multiple applications. It has been produced by Formica Group manufacturing sites across the globe since. Formica Group are best known for the company&#x27;s classic product: a heat-resistant, wipe-clean laminate of paper with melamine resin.

The mineral mica was commonly used at that time for electrical insulation. Because the new product acted as a substitute &quot;for mica&quot;, Faber used the name &quot;Formica&quot; as a trademark. The word already existed as the scientific name for wood ants, from which formic acid and the derivative formaldehyde compound used in the resin were first isolated.

== Founding and initial product development ==
Formica laminate was invented in 1912 by Daniel J. O&#x27;Conor and Herbert A. Faber, while they were working at Westinghouse, resulting in a patent filing on 1 February 1913. U.S. Patent No. 1,284,432 was granted on 12 November 1918. O&#x27;Conor and Faber originally conceived it as a substitute for mica used as electrical insulation, made of wrapped woven fabric coated with Bakelite thermosetting resin, then slit lengthwise, flattened, and cured in a press.

Immediately afterwards, O&#x27;Conor and Faber left Westinghouse to establish a business based on the product, enlisting lawyer and banker John G. Tomlin as an investor. Tomlin provided $7,500 capital as a silent business partner. The company began operations on 2 May 1913, and was immediately successful: by September, Formica Products Company employed eighteen people trying to fill the demand for electrical parts for Bell Electric Motor, Ideal Electric, and Northwest Electric.

After the General Bakelite Company decided to sell resin for sheet insulation only to Westinghouse, allowing the Formica company other shapes with smaller markets, they switched to a similar competitive phenolic resin, Redmanol. After patent litigation favorable to Baekeland in 1922, the Redmanol Chemical Products Company was merged with the General Bakelite Company (founded by Baekeland in 1910) and the Condensite Company (founded by J. W. Aylesworth) to form The Bakelite Corporation.

An important application devised in the 1920s was the use of phenolic laminate fabric for gears; cut on conventional hobbing machines, the gears were tough and quiet, which was important for automotive timing gears. By 1932, the Formica Insulation Company was producing 6,000 gear blanks per day for Chevrolet and other car makers.

In 1927, Formica Insulation Company obtained a patent on an opaque barrier sheet that allowed the use of rotogravure printing to make wood-grained or marble-surfaced laminate, the first of many innovations that were to associate the name &quot;Formica&quot; with decorative interior products.

In 1938, melamine thermosetting resin was developed by American Cyanamid Company. It resisted heat, abrasion and moisture better than phenolic or urea resins and could be used to make more colors; soon after, the Formica Corporation was buying the entire output of melamine from American Cyanamid.

During World War II, it manufactured &quot;Pregwood&quot; plastic-impregnated wooden aeroplane propellers and bomb parts. Post-war, engineering uses declined, ceasing in 1970 in favor of decorative laminates.

The company was headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, for many years. After WWII, it entered the European market through a license agreement.

== Acquisition by American Cyanamid ==

In 1956, American Cyanamid acquired Formica Corporation. The principal reason was to have a captive buyer for melamine, as Cyanamid was one of the largest producers. However, this was soon thwarted due to an anti-trust action by the US Department of Justice. Through a settlement agreement in 1964, American Cyanamid was required to sell its melamine plant at Willow Island, West Virginia.

Cyanamid operated Formica Corporation as a fully consolidated subsidiary, rather than as an operating division, allowing it to retain the term &quot;Formica&quot; as a corporate name. This gave added protection to the trademark, helping to protect the word from becoming generic—which had been tried by many competitors, against whom Cyanamid gained legal injunctions—to protect this valuable trademark name. Historically, trademarks owned by other corporations which had become generic words, such as &quot;shredded wheat&quot;, were no longer the exclusive property of their originators. Cyanamid resolutely defended the Formica brand name.

Dan O&#x27;Conor, son of the inventor, remained as president of Formica Corporation after the acquisition. He was named vice president of Cyanamid in 1960 and executive vice president four years later. In 1967, O&#x27;Conor was paralyzed in an automobile accident and resigned from the company. He died in 1974 at the age of 57.

In October 1984, American Cyanamid sold its Formica brand in a management buyout that also included executives from Shearson/American Express. After the sale, Formica group diversified with products such as solid surfacing and metal laminates.

== 21st century ==

In 2007, Fletcher Building group purchased Formica Corp. from private equity investors Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and Oaktree Capital Management, LLC for $700 million. In 2018, Fletcher Building announced plans to sell Formica to Broadview Holdings (parent of Trespa) for NZD $1.226 billion (US$840 m); the sale was finalised the following year.

<doc id="553490" wikidata="Q2902996" url="?curid=553490" title="United States Army enlisted rank insignia">
<text>The chart below shows the current enlisted rank insignia of the United States Army, with seniority, and pay grade, increasing from right to left. The enlisted ranks of corporal (E-4) and higher are considered non-commissioned officers (NCOs). The rank of specialist is also in pay grade E-4, but does not hold non-commissioned officer status; it is common that a soldier may never hold the rank of corporal, and instead be promoted from specialist to sergeant, attaining junior NCO status at that time.


In the beginning, U.S. Army enlisted rank was indicated by colored epaulets. The use of chevrons came into being in 1821, with the orientation changing over time from point-down to point-up and back again, to the point-down orientation seen in the American Civil War. Around the turn of the 20th century, point-up wear of chevrons returned and has remained so.

==History==
===1775–1821: epaulets===

From the creation of the United States Army to 1821, non-commissioned officer (NCO) and staff non-commissioned officer (SNCO) rank was distinguished by the wearing of usually worsted epaulets.

From 1775 to 1779, sergeants and corporals wore one epaulet on the right shoulder, corporals of green color, sergeants of red color.

In 1779, (SNCOs) were authorized two silk epaulets, sergeants two worsted and corporals one worsted on the right shoulder. The color was white (infantry), yellow (artillery), or blue (dragoons). In practice it seems the prescribed blue epaulettes for cavalry NCO never came in wide use while the wearing of white epaulettes prevailed.

By 1783/84, the Continental Army was discharged. For a few weeks, only 55 artillerymen at West Point and 25 men at Fort Pitt were to remain. In August 1784, the 700 men strong First American Regiment (including two companies of artillery) was organized as kind of an army substitute. In October 1786 by approval of Congress, this force should expand to a &quot;Legionary Corps&quot; of additional infantry, rifle troops, artillery, and dragoons. But this project never materialized. In 1791, the Second Regiment of Infantry was raised and organized as the First Regiment. Both units amalgamated in 1792 with the Legion of the United States, including artillery and dragoons (the first federal mounted force since the discharge of the Continental Light Dragoons in 1783), that then transformed into the US Army in 1796.

Uniform regulations dated January 30, 1787 prescribed, SNCOs wore two silver silk epaulets, sergeants two worsted and corporals one worsted. In the same year, the epaulets&#x27; color of cavalry NCOs officially changed from blue to white. At that time the federal mounted force of two troops of dragoons existed only on paper and never got beyond the planning stage (see above).

In 1799, red worsted epaulets were prescribed for all NCOs in all branches: SNCOs on both shoulders, sergeants on the right shoulder, corporals on the left. Chief musicians were identified by two white epaulets. Shortly after, in the year 1800, the color of the epaulets was changed to yellow, for chief musicians in to blue. In reality, the artillery NCOs ignored the order of 1799 and maintained their yellow epaulets, as did a company of bombardiers, sappers, and miners recruited during the War of 1812. In 1802 the infantry NCOs switched back to their former white epaulets. By 1808 dragoons were wearing white and riflemen yellow. SNCOs probably wore two worsted epaulettes with crescent, sergeants two plain worsted epaulettes, and corporals wore one epaulette on the right shoulder. Sergeants were given two epaulets once again in 1812.

===1821–1832: chevrons and &quot;wings&quot; vs. epaulettes===
From 1821 to 1832, enlisted personnel wore dark blue &quot;wings&quot; trimmed in yellow (infantry, in white) on each shoulder and a horizontal row of four yellow (infantry, white) buttons on each cuff. This precluded the use of epaulets. Rank was shown by a single, point up, chevron. Sergeants major and quartermaster sergeants wore the chevron on both upper sleeves, principal musicians and sergeants on both lower sleeves and corporals on the right upper sleeve. The chevrons were yellow for artillery and white for infantry. The regulations prescribe black chevrons for riflemen but that regiment had been abolished.

In 1825 this system was changed. Sergeants major, quartermaster sergeants and principal musicians now wore a chevron and an arc on both upper sleeves, sergeant a chevron on both upper sleeves and corporals a chevron on both lower sleeves.

===1832–1851: epaulettes and slash flaps===
The above system was superseded in 1832. At that time, enlisted personnel wore a pair of yellow (infantry, white) cloth epaulets with 2 1/2&quot; long and 1/2&quot; in diameter gold (possibly silver for infantry) fringe for senior NCOs, 1/4” diameter worsted fringe for sergeants and 1/8’ inch worsted fringe for corporals (privates wore very short fringe). Senior NCOs wore a coat with two rows of ten buttons that ended 3 1/2&quot; above the knees, while all other enlisted personnel had single-breasted coats with nine buttons that ended 7&quot; above the knees. Senior NCOs would have worn a crimson colored sash and a yellow or white aiguillette.

In addition, there were on the cuffs a slash flap with yellow (infantry, white) lace and a vertical row of several golds (infantry, silver) buttons depending on grade: senior sergeants wore four flaps and buttons, sergeant wore three flaps and buttons, corporals and privates wore two flaps and buttons. A sergeant-major of artillery had a red plume on the dress hat and a sergeant major of infantry a white plume; quartermaster sergeants in both branches had a light blue plume. Principal or chief musicians were only in the infantry and wore a white plume. A first or orderly sergeant had no plume but wore the uniform of a sergeant with a red waist sash.

By 1834 the epaulets for senior NCOs were the same as those for lieutenants (gold for artillery or silver for infantry with 1/8” wide fringe). Unlike lieutenants the fringe was worsted in yellow for artillery and white for infantry.

When a regiment of dragoons was added in 1833, the prescribed uniforms had a simple pointed cuff and metal shoulder scales. Senior NCOs were distinguished by aiguillettes and yellow sashes. Sergeants wore three yellow point down chevrons on both upper sleeves and corporals two. The yellow sash was also worn by first sergeants.

By 1839 ordnance sergeants wore the uniform of an artillery sergeant major with no aiguillette and a dark blue trouser stripe.

In 1845, horse artillery companies were allowed dragoon-like uniforms with red chevrons.

===Chevrons on fatigue jackets 1833–1847===
The use of the sergeant&#x27;s and corporals&#x27;s chevrons by dragoons beginning in 1833 is described in regulations as part of the description of the dress coat. This would seem to indicate that they were not worn on the fatigue jacket. However a price list from the era shows higher prices for sergeant&#x27;s and corporal&#x27;s jackets due to the addition of the chevrons. Therefore, it is probable that sergeants and corporals wore the chevrons on their fatigue jackets with first sergeants and senior NCOs being distinguished by their sashes.

This would have also applied to the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen created in 1846, especially since they were only allowed the fatigue jackets.

It is also possible, if not probable, that sergeants and corporals of other branches were wearing chevrons on their jackets prior to 1847.

===Chevrons 1851–1902===

In 1851 the army did a major overhaul of its uniforms. This introduced colors for each branch. Chevrons were to be of these colors. The 1851 colors were Saxony blue for infantry (changed to sky blue by 1857), red for artillery, yellow for engineers, orange for dragoons, green for mounted riflemen and crimson for ordnance.

Chevrons were now worn point down.

In 1872 the construction of chevrons was changed to a single piece of colored cloth with the chevrons and arcs outlined in heavy black stitching. At this time engineers switched from yellow that they had shared with cavalry since 1858 to red with the stitching done in white. This began the concept of some branches having two colors.

In 1884 the chevrons on dress uniforms were changed to a single piece of colored cloth with the chevrons and arcs made of gold lace. Engineers added white stitching around the lace.

Chevrons were worn on coats, but were not worn on shirts. In fact shirts are barely mentioned in regulations. During the Spanish–American War in 1898 shirts were worn without coats due to the warm climates in which it was fought. The army allowed chevrons on shirts in July. The large coat chevrons did not fit on shirt sleeves so soldiers began to fashion smaller versions of their chevrons. The army gave preliminary approval of smaller chevrons in 1900. Full implementation was superseded by a change in uniforms in 1902.
===1902–present: chevrons point up===

====1902–1920====
With the 1902 uniform change the smaller shirt sized chevrons were prescribed for all uniforms. They were to be worn point up. The chevrons were in the branch colors on a blue, white, khaki or olive drab background.

The branch colors in 1902 were,
*&quot;Cavalry:&quot; Yellow
*&quot;Artillery:&quot; Red
*&quot;Infantry:&quot; Light Blue
*&quot;Quartermaster’s Department (including USMA Detachment):&quot; Buff
*&quot;Substance Department:&quot; Grey
*&quot;Medical Department &amp; Hospital Corps:&quot; Maroon and White
*&quot;Corps of Engineers:&quot; Red and White
*&quot;Ordnance Department:&quot; Black and red
*&quot;Signal Corps:&quot; Orange and White

There were 34 enlisted ranks to be shown in these nine colors, each on four different backgrounds. This was more than the army&#x27;s supply system could handle. In 1904 the colored chevrons were restricted to the dress blue coat. On olive drab, khaki and white uniforms the chevrons would be made of olive drab shirting flannel on the appropriate colored background to match the coat.

Implementation of the new chevrons was slow. In 1905 the army ordered that any of the older larger chevrons still in use would also be worn point up.

According to Army Regulations of 1904 the ranks and grades were:

12. Regimental Sergeant Major,
 Sergeant Major Senior Grade,
 Master Electrician,
 Master Signal Electrician.

13. Ordnance Sergeant,
 Post Commissary Sergeant,

The white coat was restricted to medical personnel in 1907, the khaki coat was abolished in 1911 and the blue coat was suspended in 1917. This left only the olive on olive chevrons that were used through World War I.

Wartime reorganization left the army with 55 enlisted ranks serving in 18 branches by 1918. Attempts were made to eliminate branch specific distinctions and the wear of chevrons was restricted to the right sleeve only in order to simplify the supply situation.

After the war the army continued these reforms by changing the insignia for a private first class from the branch insignia to a single arc and eliminating the concept of the background of a chevron had to match the garment it was worn on.

In 1920 some color was added to certain chevrons and even a white navy petty officer&#x27;s eagle was added to the insignia of master engineers and quartermaster sergeants. These new insignia were never issued due to a major change in enlisted ranks and insignia later in 1920.

====1920–1942====
The biggest change in the history of US Army enlisted ranks came on June 4, 1920. On that day congress passed a law that changed how enlisted ranks were managed. It created seven pay grades, numbered one to seven with one being the highest, and gave the president the authority to create whatever ranks were necessary within those grades. Prior to this enlisted ranks had been created by law. The laws usually laid out the size and shape of the army branch by branch, creating different ranks structures for each branch. This law ended branch specific ranks.

The law specified what percentage of the enlisted strength of the army were allowed in each of the seven grades. The first grade would contain .6% of the army&#x27;s enlisted men, the second grade 1.8%, the third grade 2%, the fourth and fifth grades 9.5%, the sixth grade 25% and the remaining 51.6% in the seventh grade. Men in the sixth and seventh grades could be rated as specialists and get extra pay. This replaced the specialist ranks such as cooks or artificers. There were six classes of specialists in both grades. Specialists first class could only be .7% of the authorized strength of the sixth and seventh grades. Specialists second class were restricted to 1.4%, specialists third class 1.9%, specialists fourth class 4.7%, specialists fifth class 5% and specialists sixth class 15.2%.

The army implemented the new law on June 19, 1920. The new executive authority was used to reduce the large number of ranks in use at the time to eight, plus the specialists.

Grade One was now the rank of Master Sergeant. It was created from the ranks of Regimental Sergeant Major. Sergeant Major Senior Grade, Quartermaster Sergeant Senior Grade, Master Hospital Sergeant, Master Engineer Senior Grade, Master Electrician, Master Signal Electrician, Engineer, Regimental Supply Sergeant, the senior 25% of Ordnance Sergeants, the senior 50% of Master Gunners and the Band Sergeants and Assistant Band Leader of the West Point Band.

Grade Two was now the rank of Technical Sergeant. It came from the ranks of Hospital Sergeant, Master Engineer Junior Grade, the junior 75% of Ordnance Sergeants, Electrician Sergeant First Class, Assistant Engineer, Quartermaster Sergeant and Electrician Sergeants from the Artillery School at West Point. Also in Grade Two the rank of First Sergeant was continued.

Grade Three was now the rank of Staff Sergeant. It came from the ranks ofSquadron or Battalion Sergeant Major, Squadron or Battalion Supply Sergeant, Sergeant Major Junior Grade, Sergeant First Class, the junior 50% of Master Gunners, Assistant Band Leader except from the West Point Band, Sergeant Bugler, Electrician Sergeant, Radio Sergeant, Color Sergeant and Sergeant of Field Music from the West Point Band.

The rank of Sergeant was placed in Grade Four. It absorbed the ranks of BandSergeant, Stable Sergeant, Mess Sergeant and Supply Sergeant.

The rank of Corporal was placed in Grade Five. It absorbed the ranks of Band Corporal and Corporal Bugler.

The rank of Private First Class was placed in Grade Six, and the rank of Private was placed in grade seven. Within those two grades Musicians First Class in the West Point Band were rated as Specialists First Class. Oilers in the Mine Planter Service were rated as Specialists Second Class. Stewards and Firemen in the Mine Planter Service, Musicians Second Class in the West Point Band and all other Musicians First Class were rated as Specialists Third Class. Chief Mechanics, Horseshoers, Cooks, Musicians Third Class in the West Point Band and all other Musicians Second Class were rated as Specialists Fourth Class. Chauffeurs First Class, Chauffeurs, all other Musicians Third Class, Saddlers, Assistant Stewards and Deck Hands in the Mine Planter Service, Mechanics and Wagoners were rated as Specialists Fifth Class. Buglers First Class and Buglers were rated as Specialists Sixth Class. The ranks of Farrier and Aviator are not listed in the order.

The new ranks were shown by olive drab chevrons on a dark blue background. Master Sergeant&#x27;s wore three chevrons and three arcs, Technical Sergeants three chevrons and two arcs, First Sergeants three chevrons two arcs and the traditional lozenge, Staff Sergeants three chevrons and one arc, Sergeants three chevrons, Corporals two and Privates First Class one. They were worn on the left sleeve until 1921 when they were placed on both sleeves.

Specialists were to wear the insignia of their grade, one chevron for Grade six or none for Grade Seven. Unofficially many specialists, at least in Grade Six wore one chevron with branch insignia in the angle and one to six arcs.

Khaki on dark blue chevrons were created in 1936 for use on khaki uniforms.

====1942–1948====

In 1942, there were several reforms. The pay was increased for all ranks for the first time in two decades, and combat pay was introduced. The rank of the first sergeant was moved to Grade One and the specialist ranks were abolished. The specialist ranks were replaced by the distinct ranks of technician third grade (equivalent to a staff sergeant), technician fourth grade (equivalent to a sergeant), and technician fifth grade (equivalent to a corporal). Technicians were inferior to non-commissioned officers of the same grade but superior to all grades below them. They had the same insignia as the regular rank of their grade, but with a cloth &quot;T&quot; inset below their stripes.

====1948–1956====
With the Career Compensation Act of October 12, 1949, the pay grades were broken up into seven &quot;E&quot; (enlisted and non-commissioned officer), four &quot;W&quot; (warrant officer), and eight &quot;O&quot; (officer) grades. The technician&#x27;s ranks were abolished and were absorbed into their equivalent line ranks. The rank of private was divided into two ranks of private (Grade E1 and Grade E2), and private first class (Grade E3). Corporal was regraded as Grade E4. Sergeant (Grade E5) was a career soldier rank and its former three-chevron insignia was abolished and replaced with the three chevrons and an arc of the rank of staff sergeant. The rank of staff sergeant was discontinued and the rank of technical sergeant (Grade E6) was renamed sergeant first class. The ranks of first sergeant and master sergeant were placed in (Grade E7).

In 1948, the old olive on blue insignia was abolished. In their place was a new system of smaller (2 inches wide) and narrower chevrons and arcs that were instead differenced by color called the &quot;Goldenlite&quot; system - with subdued dark blue stripes on bright yellow backing for combat arms and yellow stripes on dark blue for support arms. They were not popular. Combat-arm NCOs found their stripes were hard to identify unless the viewer was very close, making it hard to rally and lead troops. Support-arm NCOs found their stripes too small to be easily seen at a distance, making it hard to tell their seniority at a glance. When the US Army entered the Korean War, it was found that troops in combat abandoned the new insignia. They either used the support arm stripes, purchased the old larger olive-on-blue stripes from post exchanges or Army / Navy stores, or used hand-cut or tailor-made copies. The small &quot;Goldenlite&quot; stripes were abandoned in February 1951 and the dark-blue-on-yellow insignia was abolished. Larger 3-inch-wide olive-drab-on-dark-blue stripes were adopted for servicemen.

In 1950, the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC) were issued new Goldenlite yellow-on-brown insignia for wear with the taupe WAC uniform. It was the same size as the men&#x27;s small 2-inch-wide Goldenlite stripes. (Female personnel would wear the smaller 2-inch insignia until 1998, well after male personnel was issued larger, 3-inch-wide insignia in 1951.) In 1951, WACs were assigned surplus men&#x27;s Goldenlite-yellow-on-dark-blue stripes for wear with olive drab or fatigue uniforms. Also in 1951, the optional white WAC dress uniform was now authorized for wear by enlisted and NCO ranks and 2-inch Goldenlite yellow-on-white stripes were created to be worn with it.

In 1955 (as stated in Army Regulation 615–15, dated 2 July 1954), new grade structures were announced reactivating the specialist rank: specialist 3rd class (E-4, or SP3), specialist 2nd class (E-5, or SP2), specialist 1st class (E-6, or SP1) and master specialist (E-7, or MSP). The specialist insignia was the same smaller and narrower size as the old Goldenlite stripes to differentiate specialists from non-commissioned officers.

====1956–1985====

In 1956, the Army began wearing polished black leather boots instead of the traditional unpolished russet leather (as late as the early 1980s, older soldiers who had served before 1956 said they were in the &quot;brown boot&quot; army.), and the army green uniform (with Goldenlite-Yellow-on-green rank stripes) was adopted. The new enlisted rank insignia were then used on all Army uniforms (e.g., green, khaki, and fatigue). Enlisted rank insignia with a blue background was worn on the army blue dress uniform and a white background on the army white uniform.

In 1957, a 2-inch-wide set of Goldenlite-yellow-on-blue stripes were worn with the new optional army blue WAC dress uniform. In 1959, a 2-inch-wide set of Goldenlite-yellow-on-green stripes were worn with the new army green WAC duty uniform; they replaced the taupe WAC service uniform by 1961. Although the WAC was disestablished in 1978, the army green WAC uniform would be in use until 1985.

In 1958, as part of a rank restructuring, two pay grades and four ranks were added: sergeant (E-5) returned to its traditional three chevron insignia, E-6 became staff sergeant, which had been eliminated in 1948 (with its previous three chevrons and one arc insignia), sergeant first class became E-7, master sergeant became E-8, which included first sergeant and specialist 8; and E-9, which included sergeant major and specialist 9. In 1959, the specialist insignia was made the same size and width as non-commissioned officer&#x27;s stripes. In 1961, the wearing of large Goldenlite-yellow-on-green stripes was adopted for use on all Army uniforms (green, khaki, and fatigue) except for the Army dress blue uniform, which used large insignia with a blue background and army white uniform that used a white background. In 1965, the ranks of specialist 8 and specialist 9 were discontinued. 
In 1966, the rank of Sergeant Major of the Army was established, its holder an advisor to the Army chief of staff. Considered a higher grade than sergeant major (or than command sergeant major from 1968), the Sergeant Major of the Army didn&#x27;t receive its unique rank insignia until 1979. In 1968, the rank of command sergeant major was established as an assistant to the commanding officer at battalion, brigade, division, and corps levels. Also, that year the insignia of the private first class received one arc under the chevron. In 1978, the rank of specialist 7 was discontinued. In 1975, brass enlisted rank pins were created for wear on black epaulets with the Army green shirt and black &quot;wooly-pully&quot; sweater. In 1985, the ranks of specialist 5 and specialist 6 were discontinued.

====2000–present====

In 2006, the blue Army Service Uniform (ASU) was adopted to replace the army green uniform, and the yellow-on-blue stripes were reintroduced.

Subsequently, the blue uniform was returned to formal dress use only in 2020, as the army reintroduced a green daily service uniform modeled after the pinks and greens officers service uniform from World War II. The enlisted insignia on this uniform is pale tan stripes on an olive green background.

==Command roles==

The headquarters of each company-sized unit is assigned a senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) who, as the highest-ranking enlisted person in the company/battery/troop, monitors the enlisted personnel and is their advocate with the commanding officer. This position is known as the &quot;first sergeant,&quot; though the person carrying that title does not have to have that rank. In a battalion or larger unit, the senior NCO is a sergeant major. The rank of sergeant major is usually carried by the senior NCO of the S-3 staff section in a battalion, regiment, or a brigade, and in most staff sections in larger units. The command sergeant major fills an advisory function, assisting the commander of a battalion, regiment, brigade, or higher formation in personnel matters. The Sergeant Major of the Army has a similar role assisting the Army Chief of Staff.

In terms of command, the rank of a person typically determines what job and command the soldier has within a unit. For personnel in US Army mechanized infantry, a Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (M2A2) is commanded by a Staff Sergeant, the gun is manned by a Specialist or Sergeant and the driver is Specialist or below. For armor, the Abrams main battle tank (M1A2) is commanded by a captain, lieutenant, sergeant first class or staff sergeant, the gunner is a staff sergeant or sergeant, and the driver and loader are specialists or below.

==Forms of address==

Forms of address specified in Army Regulation AR 600-20 &quot;Army Command Policy&quot; are: &quot;Sergeant Major&quot; and &quot;First Sergeant&quot; for those holding those ranks, and &quot;Sergeant&quot; for master sergeants, sergeants first class, staff sergeants, and sergeants. Corporals and specialists are addressed by their rank. Privates first class and privates (both PV1 and PV2) can all be addressed as &quot;Private&quot;.

In some cases, informal titles are used. &quot;Top&quot; is commonly used as an informal address to first sergeants or anyone serving as a company first sergeant. In field artillery units a platoon sergeant (usually an E-7) is informally referred to as &quot;Smoke&quot; (from &quot;chief of smoke&quot;, a reference to when units fired as whole batteries of between four and six guns, and the senior NCO position was &quot;Chief of Firing Battery&quot;). The junior E-7 position is designated as &quot;Gunnery Sergeant&quot; and similar to the USMC usage, is typically referred to as &quot;Gunny&quot;. Field artillery cannon sections are led by section chiefs (usually an E-6) are often informally called &quot;Chief&quot;. This does not seem to be common in other section-based unit subdivisions such as staff sections. In some smaller units, with more tight-knit squads, soldiers might call their squad leader &quot;Boss&quot;, or a similar respectful term. A habit that has all but died out is the addressing of a platoon sergeant, in any unit other than artillery, being affectionately called a &quot;platoon daddy&quot; in casual conversation or jest (but never in any official communication of any type). In some training units (BCT and AIT or OSUT), trainees are called &quot;Private&quot;, regardless of the rank worn. Special titles, such as &quot;drill sergeant&quot; and &quot;gunnery sergeant&quot; are specific to certain jobs (position title), and should not be confused for actual rank. Other services differ, such as the Marine Corps, which address each other by full rank.

Some terms are used jokingly when referring to a soldier&#x27;s rank. For instance, specialists are sometimes jokingly referred to as &quot;The E-4 Mafia&quot; (referring to their pay grade of E-4), &quot;Command Private Major&quot;, &quot;Specialist Major&quot;, &quot;Full-Bird Private&quot; (from the eagle on their shield), &quot;Sham Shield&quot; (from their stereotype of &quot;shamming it&quot;, or malingering), &quot;PV4&quot;, or &quot;Spec-4&quot; (about the old specialist grades, which at one point went up to Specialist 9).

An E-2 Private may be referred to as &quot;Private 2nd Class&quot;. Privates (PV2) rank insignia are sometimes called &quot;Mosquito Wings&quot; (from the appearance of the single chevron).

Privates are called &quot;Buck Privates&quot; because they are the lowest rank of private. An E-1 Private may be referred to as &quot;E-Nothing&quot;, or &quot;PV-Nothing&quot; (as opposed to PV2, the next rank) due to their lack of rank insignia. E-1 Privates were also called a &quot;Fuzzy&quot; or &quot;E-Fuzzy&quot; during the War on Terror era due to the bare velcro patch-holders on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU).

<doc id="553494" wikidata="Q732358" url="?curid=553494" title="Nomarch">
<text>A nomarch (, Great Chief) was a provincial governor in ancient Egypt; the country was divided into 42 provinces, called nomes (singular , plural ). A nomarch was the government official responsible for a nome.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;nome&quot; is derived from &quot;nomós&quot; &quot;province, district&quot;. &quot;Nomarch&quot; is derived from &quot;nomárkhēs&quot;: &quot;province&quot; + &quot;ruler&quot;.

==Egyptian history==
The division of the Egyptian kingdom into nomes can be documented as far back as the reign of Djoser of the 3rd Dynasty in the early Old Kingdom, c. 2670 BCE, and potentially dates even further back to the Predynastic kingdoms of the Nile valley. The earliest topographical lists of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt date back to the reign of Nyuserre Ini, of the mid 5th Dynasty, from which time the nomarchs no longer lived at royal capital but stayed in their nomes.

The power of the nomarchs grew with the reforms of Nyuserre&#x27;s second successor, Djedkare Isesi, which effectively decentralized the Egyptian state. The post of nomarch then quickly became hereditary, thereby creating a virtual feudal system where local allegiances slowly superseded obedience to the pharaoh. Less than 200 years after Djedkare&#x27;s reign, the nomarchs had become the all-powerful heads of the provinces. At the dawn of the First Intermediate Period, the power of the Pharaohs of the 8th Dynasty had diminished to the extent that they owed their position to the most powerful nomarchs, upon whom they could only bestow titles and honours.

The power of the nomarchs remained important during the later royal revival under the impulse of the 11th Dynasty, originally a family of Theban nomarchs. Their power diminished during the subsequent 12th Dynasty, setting the stage for the apex of royal power during the Middle Kingdom.

==Later re-use of the term==
The title &quot;nomarch&quot; continued to be used into the Roman period.

The title is also in use in modern Greece for the heads of the prefectures of Greece, which were also titled &quot;nomos&quot; (pl. νομοί, &quot;nomoi&quot;; νομαρχία, &quot;nomarchia&quot; also being used to refer to the area within a nomarch&#x27;s purview).

<doc id="553500" wikidata="Q5786" url="?curid=553500" title="Arch of Constantine">
<text>The Arch of Constantine () is a triumphal arch in Rome dedicated to the emperor Constantine the Great. The arch was commissioned by the Roman Senate to commemorate Constantine&#x27;s victory over Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in AD 312. Situated between the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill, the arch spans the &quot;Via Triumphalis&quot;, the route taken by victorious military leaders when they entered the city in a triumphal procession. Dedicated in 315, it is the largest Roman triumphal arch, with overall dimensions of high, wide and deep. It has three bays, the central one being high and wide and the laterals by each. The arch is constructed of brick-faced concrete covered in marble.

The three-bay design with detached columns was first used for the Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum (which stands at the end of the triumph route) and repeated in several other arches now lost.

Though dedicated to Constantine, much of the sculptural decoration consists of reliefs and statues removed from earlier triumphal monuments dedicated to Trajan (98–117), Hadrian (117–138) and Marcus Aurelius (161–180), with the portrait heads replaced with his own.

== History ==
The arch, which was constructed between 312 and 315, was dedicated by the Senate to commemorate ten years (&quot;a decennia&quot;) of Constantine&#x27;s reign (306–337) and his victory over the then reigning emperor Maxentius (306–312) at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312, as described on its attic inscription, and officially opened on 25 July 315. Not only did the Roman senate give the arch for Constantine&#x27;s victory, they also were celebrating decennalia: a series of games that happened every decade during the Roman Empire. On these occasions they also said many prayers and renewed both spiritual and mundane vows. However, Constantine had actually entered Rome on 29 October 312, amidst great rejoicing, and the Senate then commissioned the monument. Constantine then left Rome within two months and did not return until 326.

The location, between the Palatine Hill and the Caelian Hill, spanned the ancient route of Roman triumphs (&quot;Via triumphalis&quot;) at its origin, where it diverged from the &quot;Via sacra&quot;. This route was that taken by the emperors when they entered the city in triumph. This route started at the Campus Martius, led through the Circus Maximus, and around the Palatine Hill; immediately after the Arch of Constantine, the procession would turn left at the Meta Sudans and march along the &quot;Via sacra&quot; to the Forum Romanum and on to the Capitoline Hill, passing through both the Arches of Titus and Septimius Severus.

During the Middle Ages, the Arch of Constantine was incorporated into one of the family strongholds of ancient Rome, as shown in the painting by Herman van Swanevelt, here. Works of restoration were first carried out in the 18th century, the last excavations have taken place in the late 1990s, just before the Great Jubilee of 2000. The arch served as the finish line for the marathon athletic event for the 1960 Summer Olympics.

The arch was damaged after sustaining a direct hit from a lightning strike on 3 September 2024.

=== Controversy ===
There has been much controversy over the origins of the arch, with some scholars claiming that it should no longer be referred to as Constantine&#x27;s arch, but is in fact an earlier work from the time of Hadrian, reworked during Constantine&#x27;s reign, or at least the lower part. Another theory holds that it was erected, or at least started, by Maxentius, and one scholar believed it was as early as the time of Domitian (81–96).

=== Symbolism ===
Maxentius&#x27;s reputation in Rome was influenced by his contributions to public building. By the time of his accession in 306 Rome was becoming increasingly irrelevant to the governance of the empire, most emperors choosing to live elsewhere and focusing on defending the fragile boundaries, where they frequently founded new cities.

These factors contributed to Maxentius&#x27; ability to seize power. In contrast to his predecessors, Maxentius concentrated on restoring the capital; his epithet was &quot;conservator urbis suae&quot; (preserver of his city). Thus, Constantine was perceived as the deposer of one of the city&#x27;s greatest benefactors, and needed to acquire legitimacy. Much controversy has surrounded the patronage of the public works of this period. Issuing a damnatio memoriae, Constantine set out to systematically erase the memory of Maxentius. Consequently, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the patronage of early fourth century public buildings, including the Arch of Constantine, which may originally have been an Arch of Maxentius.

==Sculptural style==
Constantine&#x27;s Arch is an important example, frequently cited in surveys of art history, of the stylistic changes of the 4th century, and the &quot;collapse of the classical Greek canon of forms during the late Roman period&quot;, a sign the city was in decline, and would soon be eclipsed by Constantine&#x27;s founding of a new capital at Constantinople in 324. The contrast between the styles of the re-used Imperial reliefs of Trajan, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius and those newly made for the arch is dramatic and, according to Ernst Kitzinger, &quot;violent&quot;, that where the head of an earlier emperor was replaced by that of Constantine the artist was still able to achieve a &quot;soft, delicate rendering of the face of Constantine&quot; that was &quot;a far cry from the dominant style of the workshop&quot;. It remains the most impressive surviving civic monument from Rome in Late Antiquity, but is also one of the most controversial with regards to its origins and meanings.

Kitzinger compares a roundel of Hadrian lion-hunting, which is &quot;still rooted firmly in the tradition of late Hellenistic art&quot;, and there is &quot;an illusion of open, airy space in which figures move freely and with relaxed self-assurance&quot; with the later frieze where the figures are &quot;pressed, trapped, as it were, between two imaginary planes and so tightly packed within the frame as to lack all freedom of movement in any direction&quot;, with &quot;gestures that are &quot;jerky, overemphatic and uncoordinated with the rest of the body&quot;. In the 4th century reliefs, the figures are disposed geometrically in a pattern that &quot;makes sense only in relation to the spectator&quot;, in the &quot;largesse&quot; scene (below) centred on the emperor who looks directly out to the viewer. Kitzinger continues: Gone too is the classical canon of proportions. Heads are disproportionately large, trunks square, legs stubby ... Differences in the physical size of figures drastically underline differences of rank and importance which the second-century artist had indicated by subtle compositional means within a seemingly casual grouping. Gone, finally are elaboration of detail and differentiation of surface texture. Faces are cut rather than modeled, hair takes the form of a cap with some superficial stippling, drapery folds are summarily indicated by deeply drilled lines.

The commission was clearly highly important, if hurried, and the work must be considered as reflecting the best available craftsmanship in Rome at the time; the same workshop was probably responsible for a number of surviving sarcophagi. The question of how to account for what may seem a decline in both style and execution has generated a vast amount of discussion. Factors introduced into the discussion include: a breakdown of the transmission in artistic skills due to the political and economic disruption of the Crisis of the Third Century,influence from Eastern and other pre-classical regional styles from around the Empire (a view promoted by Josef Strzygowski (1862–1941), and now mostly discounted), the emergence into high-status public art of a simpler &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;Italic&quot; style that had been used by the less wealthy throughout the reign of Greek models, an active ideological turning against what classical styles had come to represent, and a deliberate preference for seeing the world simply and exploiting the expressive possibilities of a simpler style. The sculptors of Constantine&#x27;s time were more interested in symbolism: both symbolism for religion as well as symbolism for history. One factor that cannot be responsible, as the date and origin of the Venice Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs show, is the rise of Christianity to official support, as the changes predated that.

The stylistic references to the earlier arches of Titus and Septimius Severus, together with the incorporation of &quot;spolia&quot; from the times of other earlier emperors may be considered a deliberate tribute to Roman history.

==Iconography==
The arch is heavily decorated with parts of older monuments, which assume a new meaning in the context of the Constantinian building. As it celebrates the victory of Constantine, the new &quot;historic&quot; friezes illustrating his campaign in Italy convey the central meaning: the praise of the emperor, both in battle and in his civilian duties. The other imagery supports this purpose: decoration taken from the &quot;golden times&quot; of the Empire under the 2nd century emperors whose reliefs were re-used places Constantine next to these &quot;good emperors&quot;, and the content of the pieces evokes images of the victorious and pious ruler.

Another explanation given for the re-use is the short time between the start of construction (late 312 at the earliest) and the dedication (summer 315), so the architects used existing artwork to make up for the lack of time to create new art. It could be that so many old parts were used because the builders themselves did not &quot;feel&quot; the artists of their time could do better than what had already been done by different people. As yet another possible reason, it has often been suggested that the Romans of the 4th century truly did lack the artistic skill to produce acceptable artwork, and were aware of it, and therefore plundered the ancient buildings to adorn their contemporary monuments. This interpretation has become less prominent in more recent times, as the art of Late Antiquity has been appreciated in its own right. It is possible that a combination of those explanations is correct.

===Attic===
On the top of each column, large sculptures representing Dacians can be seen, which date from Trajan. Above the central archway is the inscription, forming the most prominent portion of the attic and is identical on both sides of the arch. Flanking the inscription on both sides are four pairs of relief panels above the minor archways, eight in total. These were taken from an unknown monument erected in honour of Marcus Aurelius. On the north side, from left to right, the panels depict the emperor&#x27;s return to Rome after the campaign (&quot;adventus&quot;), the emperor leaving the city and saluted by a personification of the Via Flaminia, the emperor distributing money among the people (&quot;largitio&quot;), and the emperor interrogating a German prisoner. On the south side, from left to right, are depicted a captured enemy chieftain led before the emperor, a similar scene with other prisoners (illustrated below), the emperor speaking to the troops (&quot;adlocutio&quot;), and the emperor sacrificing a pig, sheep and bull (&quot;suovetaurilia&quot;). Together with three panels now in the Capitoline Museum, the reliefs were probably taken from a triumphal monument commemorating Marcus Aurelius&#x27; war against the Marcomanni and the Sarmatians from 169–175, which ended with Marcus Aurelius&#x27; triumphant return in 176. On the &quot;largitio&quot; panel, the figure of Marcus Aurelius&#x27; son Commodus has been eradicated following the latter&#x27;s &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;.

From the same time period the two large (3 m high) panels decorating the attic on the east and west sides of the arch show scenes from Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars. Together with the two reliefs on the inside of the central archway, these came from a large frieze celebrating the Dacian victory. The original place of this frieze was either the Forum of Trajan, or the barracks of the emperor&#x27;s horse guard on the Caelius.
===Main section===
The general layout of the main façade is identical on both sides of the arch, consisting of four columns on bases, dividing the structure into a central arch and two lateral arches, the latter being surmounted by two round reliefs over a horizontal frieze. The four columns are of Corinthian order made of Numidian yellow marble (&quot;giallo antico&quot;), one of which has been transferred into the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano and was replaced by a white marble column. The columns stand on bases (plinths or socles), decorated on three sides. The reliefs on the front show &quot;Victoria&quot;, either inscribing a shield or holding palm branches, while those to the side show captured barbarians alone or with Roman soldiers. Though Constantinian, they are modelled on those of the Arch of Septimius Severus (and the destroyed &quot;Arcus novus&quot;), and may be considered as a &quot;standard&quot; item.

The pairs of round reliefs above each lateral archway date to the times of Emperor Hadrian. They display scenes of hunting and sacrificing: (north side, left to right) hunt of a boar, sacrifice to Apollo, hunt of a lion, sacrifice to Hercules. On the south side, the left pair show the departure for the hunt (see below) and sacrifice to Silvanus, while those on the right (illustrated on the right) show the hunt of a bear and sacrifice to Diana. The head of the emperor (originally Hadrian) has been reworked in all medallions: on the north side, into Constantine in the hunting scenes and into Licinius or Constantius I in the sacrifice scenes; on the south side, vice versa. The reliefs, &quot;c.&quot; 2 m in diameter, were framed in porphyry; this framing is only extant on the right side of the northern façade. Similar medallions, of Constantinian origin, are located on the small sides of the arch; the eastern side shows the Sun rising, on the western side, the Moon. Both are on chariots.

The spandrels of the main archway are decorated with reliefs depicting victory figures with trophies (illustrated below), those of the smaller archways show river gods. Column bases and spandrel reliefs are from the time of Constantine.
==== Constantinian frieze ====
The horizontal frieze below the round reliefs are the main parts from the time of Constantine, running around the monument, one strip above each lateral archway and including the west and east sides of the arch. These &quot;historical&quot; reliefs depict scenes from the Italian campaign of Constantine against Maxentius which was the reason for the construction of the monument. The frieze starts at the western side with the Departure from Milan (Profectio). It continues on the southern, face, with the Siege of Verona () on the left (South west), an event which was of great importance to the war in Northern Italy. On the right (South east) is depicted the Battle of the Milvian Bridge () with Constantine&#x27;s army victorious and the enemy drowning in the river Tiber. On the eastern side, Constantine and his army enter Rome (); the artist seems to have avoided using imagery of the triumph, as Constantine probably did not want to be shown triumphant over the Eternal City. On the northern face, looking towards the city, are two strips with the emperor&#x27;s actions after taking possession of Rome. On the left (North east) is Constantine speaking to the citizens on the Forum Romanum (), while to the right (North west) is the final panel with Constantine distributing money to the people (Liberalitas).
===Inner sides of the archways===
In the central archway, there is one large panel of Trajan&#x27;s Dacian War on each wall. Inside the lateral archways are eight portraits busts (two on each wall), destroyed to such an extent that it is no longer possible to identify them.

==Inscriptions==
The main inscription on the attic would originally have been of bronze letters. It can still be read easily; only the recesses in which the letters sat, and their attachment holes, remain. It reads thus, identically on both sides (with abbreviations completed in parentheses): 

:To the Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantinus, the greatest, pious, and blessed Augustus: because he, inspired by the divine, and by the greatness of his mind, has delivered the state from the tyrant and all of his followers at the same time, with his army and just force of arms, The Senate and Roman People have dedicated this arch, decorated with triumphs.

The words &quot;instinctu divinitatis&quot; (&quot;inspired by the divine&quot;) have been greatly commented on. They are usually read as sign of Constantine&#x27;s shifting religious affiliation: The Christian tradition, most notably Lactantius and Eusebius of Caesarea, relate the story of a vision of God to Constantine during the campaign, and that he was victorious in the sign of the cross at the Milvian Bridge. The official documents (esp. coins) still prominently display the Sun god until 324, while Constantine started to support the Christian church from 312 on. In this situation, the vague wording of the inscription can be seen as the attempt to please all possible readers, being deliberately ambiguous, and acceptable to both pagans and Christians.
As was customary, the vanquished enemy is not mentioned by name, but only referred to as &quot;the tyrant&quot;, drawing on the notion of the rightful killing of a tyrannical ruler; together with the image of the &quot;just war&quot;, it serves as justification of Constantine&#x27;s civil war against Maxentius.

Two short inscriptions on the inside of the central archway transport a similar message: Constantine came not as conqueror, but freed Rome from occupation:
: (liberator of the city) — (founder of peace)

Over each of the small archways, inscriptions read:
:
They give a hint on the date of the arch: &quot;Solemn vows for the 10th anniversary – for the 20th anniversary&quot; and &quot;as for the 10th, so for the 20th anniversary&quot;. Both refer to Constantine&#x27;s &quot;decennalia&quot;, i.e. the 10th anniversary of his reign (counted from 306), which he celebrated in Rome in the summer of 315. It can be assumed that the arch honouring his victory was inaugurated during his stay in the city.

<text>Gort ( or ) is a town of around 2,800 inhabitants in County Galway in the west of Ireland. Located near the border with County Clare, the town lies between the Burren and the Slieve Aughty and is served by the R458 and R460 regional roads, which connect to the M18 motorway.

==Etymology==
Gort is short for the complete Irish name, &quot;Gort Inse Guaire&quot; (&quot;gort:&quot; a meadow, field, &quot;inse:&quot; an island, and &quot;Guaire:&quot; a proper name) and translates to &quot;field of Guaire&#x27;s island&quot;.

== History ==
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes ringfort, souterrain and holy well sites in the townlands of Gort, Ballyhugh, Cloghnakeava, Cloonnahaha and Lavally. In 2022, a large Bronze Age fort, located in Coole Park near Gort, was dated between 800 and 1200 BCE during archaeological work in the Burren lowlands.

The Guaire in &quot;Gort Inse Guaire&quot; refers to King Guaire &quot;The Generous&quot; (Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin), the seventh century King of Connacht. Guaire reputedly kept royal residences in Gort on a small island on the Gort river and also built a fort in nearby Kinvara named Dunguaire (&quot;Fort of Guaire&quot; in Irish). He was the patron of his first cousin St. Colman MacDuagh (giving him the land for Kilmacduagh monastery)

During the Middle Ages the chiefs of Cenél Áeda na hEchtge, the O&#x27;Shaughnessys (&quot;Ó Seachnasaigh&quot;, a clan descended from Guaire Aidhneach), had their principal stronghold in Gort, a castle on the island site which later became a cavalry barracks. The castle, and manor house, were put under siege in 1652 by Cromwellian forces. The structures were taken, burned, and later destroyed.

At the end of the 17th century, the O&#x27;Shaughnessy lands were confiscated and granted to Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet, whose grandson was John Prendergast Smyth, 1st Viscount Gort. The centre of the town was built at this time (the late period in Georgian architecture) according to Lord Gort&#x27;s plans. It was designed around a large triangular market.

In the 18th and 19th century, the Gort Races took place at the Newtown Course. There were prizes and this was hosted by the local landlords for the &quot;turf loving gentry of both provinces&quot; [Munster and Connacht].

There was a large flour mill built along the river in 1806, it was 4 stories tall, with a wooden wheel, and very active. It operated until 1966. It was sold to the Gort Co-operative Mart and destroyed in 1985.

The Great Famine caused hardship and destitution in Gort, with a decrease in the population in the mid-19th century. Many people emigrated to Canada and the United States, while others fell ill and died. In 1841, the town had a population of 3,056, in 1861 the population was 2,097. There was unrest among the population, as well as rampant theft. There were also a number of relief and work schemes in the area. Gort&#x27;s Fever Hospital, and the adjacent workhouse, were built at this time.

Coole House, Lady Gregory&#x27;s home, served as a base for the Irish Literary Revival in the late 1800s and early 20th century. There is an &quot;Autograph Tree&quot;, still there, that has the carved initials of some of her notable guests: George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Seán O&#x27;Casey, Jack B. Yeats, John M. Synge, and Lady Margaret Sackville. W. B. Yeats bought a tower house, Thoor Ballylee, from the Gregorys, restored it, and made it his summer residence in the 1920s. Yeats wrote about the restoration using &quot;smithy work from the Gort forge&quot;. Jack B. Yeats painted and drew scenes of everyday life in Gort.

As a barracks town, Gort had a strong presence of Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921). A young woman, Eileen Quinn, was shot dead while holding her infant just outside of the town by the Auxiliary Division of the RIC on 1 November 1920 – in what has been described as &quot;essentially a drive-by shooting&quot;. On November 26 the Loughnane brothers were interrogated in the Gort barracks before being &quot;tied to the tailgate of a lorry and dragged to Drumharsna Castle&quot; and killed by the RIC. The British forces conducted raids, tortured, stole, and terrorised people in Gort and the area. Beatings took place at the Gort barracks. The town also hosted the military court.

Starting in the early 2000s, there was an influx of Brazilian immigrants to Gort; in 2006, they made up around 30% of the town&#x27;s population. The town hosts celebrations of Brazilian Carnival and a branch of Brazilian evangelical church Assembléia de Deus, and the local Catholic church holds services in both English and Portuguese.

== Geography ==
Gort is in County Galway and lies just north of the border with County Clare. This is on the old Galway to Limerick road (now the R458), and is about halfway between Ennis and Loughrea. It is around by road from Galway City.

The town straddles the Gort River, a river that &quot;disappears&quot; underground several times between its source and Galway Bay. Gort is in a valley between the exposed limestone region of the Burren, and the peaty hills of the Slieve Aughty.

The town is in the historical territory of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne also known as Maigh Aidhne (&quot;the plain of Aidhne&quot;), which is within the diocese of Kilmacduagh (&quot;Cill Mhic Dhuach&quot;). Gort stands in 3 parishes and 3 townlands, namely Beagh, Kilmacduach and Kiltartan, each in the barony of Kiltartan.

==Population==

As of the 2016 census, Gort had around 3,000 inhabitants and was one of the most diverse towns in Ireland, with 26.6% being non-Irish.

According to the 2006 census, approximately 40% of the residents of Gort were non-Irish, mainly Brazilians. These people originally came to work in the meat processing plants in Gort, where the pay is generally much higher than in similar plants in Brazil. According to Claire Healy&#x27;s &quot;Irish Migration Studies in Latin America&quot;, a &quot;large community of Brazilians now live, work and attend school in Gort, gradually altering the appearance and the character of the town&quot;. By the time of the 2011 census, non-Irish nationals accounted for 27.2% of the population. The largest group (417 people) were still Brazilians, followed by UK nationals (81).

== Economy ==
Gort was once an agricultural market town. As of the 21st century, it is home to a Lidl, an Aldi, and a Supervalu. It was one of the worst affected towns in Ireland in the post-2008 recession. According to a 2019 &quot;Irish Times&quot; article, &quot;[b]etween 2006 and 2011, it lost 400 jobs and 14 per cent of its population. Jobs were lost with the closure of Duffy Meats, a factory in which many Brazilians had been working, and also when the construction industry imploded&quot;.

Gort Co-operative Mart was founded in 1962, operated in the town until 1996, when it moved 2.5 kilometres out of the centre. As of 2020, approximately 16,500 cattle and 7,000 sheep &quot;passed through its gate with a €15.6 million turnover&quot;.

There are three factories in town: counter fabricator Top Form, electronics maker Lisk, and medical device maker Natus.

In December 2022, An Bord Pleanála overturned a Galway County Council planning decision and permission was granted for a biogas plant near the town. As of August 2023, a challenge against this decision was being heard by the High Court.

=== Tourism ===

According to a 2019 Irish Times article, local business people saw tourism as an important sector to expand in the town. Gort has a number of bars and restaurants, and guest accommodation. The websites of Fáilte Ireland and the &quot;Burren Lowlands&quot; destination marketing group, list nearby tourist destinations as The Burren, Coole Park Visitor Centre &amp; Gardens, Kilmacduagh cathedral churches and round tower, Thoor Ballylee, and Kiltartan Gregory Museum.

== Culture ==
A number of the town&#x27;s cultural organisations are grouped under an umbrella organisation, the Gorgeous Gort Forum. The Wild Swans Theatre Company is a local group of actors which put on plays in St. Colman&#x27;s Hall. The Cooley Collins Festival is a traditional Irish music event that takes place at the end of October. There is a museum dedicated to Lady Gregory, Kiltartan Gregory Museum, in an old schoolhouse. The Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society keeps Yeat&#x27;s 15th-century tower house open with events, a studio, and tours. Guaire Magazine is a magazine on local history and culture, it dates back to the mid-1970s. Since 1981, the town hosts the annual Gort and District Show, a community event which awards prizes in a number of categories from photography and crafts, to flowers and ponies. There is a Gort Arts Collective of 40 plus regional artists which organised a small St. Brigid&#x27;s Day festival in 2023.

== Places of interest ==
Gort has a number of buildings of architectural interest, being a well preserved planned Georgian period market town.

There is a mid-19th century Weigh House in the centre of the old square, as well as a 1933 marble sculpture of Christ the King by the Irish sculptor Albert Power. The town hall is a former 19th century school which is now used for community theatre. There is a large Catholic church, St. Colman&#x27;s Church (built 1825), with a public park, Canon Quinn Park, behind. The old Church of Ireland church, built , is now the public library. The Gort River Walk, opened a 3 km looped walking trail along the Gort River with a new bridge in October 2022.

Next to the river and the original bridge (constructed in 1771) is Bridge House, the original residence of Lord Gort before the move to Lough Cutra Castle. This house, dated around 1770, has since been added to and was a Sisters of Mercy convent from 1857 until 2022, with a primary school on the grounds. As of 2022 it houses Ukrainian refugees.

== Sports ==
Gort GAA club was founded in 1884 and is primarily dedicated to its hurling team. The town also has a rugby club, the Gort Gladiators, and two football (soccer) teams, Coole Football Club and Gort United Football Club. There is also the Gort Golf Club.

Cliona D&#x27;Arcy, of Gort, won the heavyweight gold medal at the 2022 IBA Youth World Boxing Championships, becoming the first Irish woman to do so.

== Transport ==

=== Motorway ===
Gort is accessible from the M18 motorway from Shannon to Galway, at Junction 16. The M18 ends at junction 18 of the M6 motorway. The road continues northbound as the M17 towards Tuam and Sligo. The segment from Ennis to Gort of the M18 motorway bypass of the town was officially opened on 12 November 2010. This was followed by the Gort to Tuam section which opened on 27 September 2017.

=== Rail ===
Gort railway station opened on 15 September 1869 and was closed for goods traffic on 3 November 1975 and for passenger traffic on 5 April 1976. It was reopened in 2010 as part of the Western Railway Corridor project.

Local director Keith Walsh and producer Jill Beardsworth made the film &quot;When All is Ruin Once Again&quot;, a &quot;highly personal documentary essay&quot; shot in, and about, Gort and neighbouring village Crusheen, in 2018. It won several awards and was considered in an RTE review to be a &quot;masterpiece of cinema&quot; and &quot;beautiful but philosophically shaky&quot; by The Irish Times.

<text>Pangasinan (&quot;Pangasinense&quot;) is an Austronesian language, and one of the eight major languages of the Philippines. It is the primary and predominant language of the entire province of Pangasinan and northern Tarlac, on the northern part of Luzon&#x27;s central plains geographic region, most of whom belong to the Pangasinan ethnic group. Pangasinan is also spoken in southwestern La Union, as well as in the municipalities of Benguet, Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija, and Zambales that border Pangasinan. A few Aeta groups and most Sambal in Central Luzon&#x27;s northern part also understand and even speak Pangasinan as well.

==Classification==
The Pangasinan language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian languages branch of the Austronesian languages family.
Pangasinan is similar to other closely related Philippine languages, Malay in Malaysia (as Malaysian), Indonesia (as Indonesian), Brunei, and Singapore, Hawaiian in Hawaii and Malagasy in Madagascar. The Pangasinan language is very closely related to the Ibaloi language spoken in the neighboring province of Benguet, located north of Pangasinan. Pangasinan is classified under the Pangasinic group of languages.

The other Pangasinic languages are:
*Ibaloi
*Karao
*Iwaak
*Kalanguya/Kallahan

==Geographic distribution==
Pangasinan is the official language of the province of Pangasinan, located on the west central area of the island of Luzon along Lingayen Gulf. The people of Pangasinan are also referred to as Pangasinense. The province has a total population of 2,343,086 (2000), of which 2 million speak Pangasinan. As of 2020, Pangasinan is ranked tenth on the leading languages generally spoken at home in the Philippines with only 334,759 households still speaking the language. Pangasinan is spoken in other Pangasinan communities in the Philippines, mostly in the neighboring provinces of Benguet, La Union, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Zambales, and Nueva Vizcaya, and has varying speakers in Metro Manila, Cagayan, Isabela, Bulacan, Bataan, Aurora, Quezon, Cavite, Laguna, Mindoro, Palawan and Mindanao especially in Soccsksargen, Davao Region, Caraga, Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental.

==History==
Austronesian speakers settled in Maritime Southeast Asia during prehistoric times, perhaps more than 5,000 years ago. The indigenous speakers of Pangasinan are descendants of these settlers, who were probably part of a wave of prehistoric human migration that is widely believed to have originated from Southern China via Taiwan between 10 and 6 thousand years ago.

The word &quot;Pangasinan&quot; means &#x27;land of salt&#x27; or &#x27;place of salt-making&#x27;; it is derived from the root word &quot;,&quot; the word for &#x27;salt&#x27; in Pangasinan. &quot;Pangasinan&quot; could also refer to a &#x27;container of salt or salted products&#x27;; it refers to the ceramic jar for storage of salt or salted-products or its contents.

===Literature===
Written Pangasinan and oral literature in the language flourished during the Spanish and American period. Writers like Juan Saingan, Felipe Quintos, Narciso Corpus, Antonio Solis, Juan Villamil, Juan Mejía and María C. Magsano wrote and published in Pangasinan. Felipe Quintos, a Pangasinan officer of the Katipunan, wrote &quot;()&quot;, a history of the Katipunan revolutionary struggle in Pangasinan and surrounding provinces. Narciso Corpus and Antonio Solis co-wrote , a short love story. (Lingayen, Pangasinan: Gumawid Press, 1926)

Juan Villamil translated José Rizal&#x27;s &quot;Mi último adiós&quot; in Pangasinan. Pablo Mejia edited , a news magazine, in the 1920s. He also wrote , a biography of Rizal. Magsano published , a literary magazine. Magsano also wrote , a romance novel. &quot;Pangasinan Courier&quot; published articles and literary works in Pangasinan. &quot;Pioneer Herald&quot; published , a literary supplement in Pangasinan. Many Christian publications in Pangasinan are widely available.

Many Pangasinan are multilingual and proficient in English, Filipino, and Ilocano. However, the spread and influence of the other languages is contributing to the decline of the Pangasinan language. Many Pangasinan people, especially the native speakers are promoting the use of Pangasinan in the print and broadcast media, Internet, local governments, courts, public facilities and schools in Pangasinan. In April 2006, the creation of Pangasinan Wikipedia was proposed, which the Wikimedia Foundation approved for publication on the Internet.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Pangasinan has the following vowel phonemes:

In native vocabulary, /i/ and /u/ are realized as [i ~ ɪ ~ ɛ] and [u ~ ʊ ~ ɔ]. The close variants [i]/[u] are only used in stressed open syllables, while the open-mid variants [ɛ]/[ɔ] occur in open and closed final syllables before a pause. The default variants [ɪ]/[ʊ] occur in all other environments.

Some speakers have /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ as distinct phonemes, but only in loanwords.

===Consonants===
Pangasinan is one of the Philippine languages that do not exhibit []-[d] allophony, they only contrast before consonants and word-final positions; otherwise, they become allophones where [d] is only located in word-initial positions and after consonants &amp; [] is only pronounced between vowels. Before consonants and word-final positions, [] is in free variation with trill [r]. In Spanish loanwords, [d] and [] contrast in all word positions.

All consonantal phonemes except may be a syllable onset or coda. The phoneme rarely occurs in coda position. Although the Spanish word &#x27;clock&#x27; would have been heard as , the final is dropped resulting in . However, this word also may have entered the Pangasinan lexicon at early enough a time that the word was still pronounced , with the &quot;j&quot; pronounced as in French, resulting in in Pangasinan. As a result, both and occur.

The glottal stop is not permissible as coda; it can only occur as onset. Even as an onset, the glottal stop disappears in affixation. Glottal stop &quot;sometimes&quot; occurs in coda in words ending in vowels, only before a pause.

==Grammar==
===Sentence structure===
Like other Malayo-Polynesian languages, Pangasinan has a verb–subject–object word order. Pangasinan is an agglutinative language.

===Pronouns===

====Personal====
===Noun affixes===
Benton (1971) lists a number of affixes for nouns. Benton describes affixes in Pangasinan as either &quot;nominal&quot; (affixes attached directly to nouns) and &quot;nominalizing&quot; (affixes which turn other parts of speech into nouns). Benton also describes &quot;non-productive affixes&quot;, affixes which are not normally applied to nouns, and only found as part of other pre-existing words. Many of these non-productive affixes are found within words derived from Spanish.

==Writing system==
Modern Pangasinan consists of 27 letters, which include the 26 letters of the basic Latin alphabet and the Pangasinan digraph &quot;ng&quot;:

The ancient people of Pangasinan used an indigenous writing system called Kuritan. The ancient Pangasinan script, which is related to the Tagalog Baybayin script, was derived from the Javanese Kawi script of Indonesia and the Vatteluttu or Pallava script of South India.

The Latin script was introduced during the Spanish colonial period. Pangasinan literature, using the indigenous syllabary and the Latin alphabet, continued to flourish during the Spanish and American colonial period. Pangasinan acquired many Spanish and English words, and some indigenous words were Hispanicized or Anglicized. However, use of the ancient syllabary has declined, and not much literature written in it has survived.

==Loanwords==

Most of the loan words in Pangasinan are Spanish, as the Philippines was ruled by Spain for more than 300 years. Examples are (&#x27;place&#x27;), (from &quot;poder&quot;, &#x27;power, care&#x27;), (from , &#x27;against&#x27;), (, &#x27;green&#x27;), (, &#x27;spirit&#x27;), and (&#x27;holy, saint&#x27;).

==Examples==

<doc id="553525" wikidata="Q204600" url="?curid=553525" title="Norman Haworth">
<text>Sir Walter Norman Haworth FRS (19 March 1883 – 19 March 1950) was a British chemist best known for his groundbreaking work on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) while working at the University of Birmingham. He received the 1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his investigations on carbohydrates and vitamin C&quot;. The prize was shared with Swiss chemist Paul Karrer for his work on other vitamins.

Haworth worked out the correct structure of a number of sugars, and is known among organic chemists for his development of the Haworth projection that translates three-dimensional sugar structures into convenient two-dimensional graphical form.

==Academic career==

Having worked for some time from the age of fourteen in the local Ryland&#x27;s linoleum factory managed by his father, he studied for and successfully passed the entrance examination to the University of Manchester in 1903 to study chemistry. He made this pursuit in spite of active discouragement by his parents. He gained his first-class honours degree in 1906. After gaining his master&#x27;s degree under William Henry Perkin Jr., he was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 and studied at the University of Göttingen earning his PhD in Otto Wallach&#x27;s laboratory after only one year of study. A DSc from the University of Manchester followed in 1911, after which he served a short time at the Imperial College of Science and Technology as Senior Demonstrator in Chemistry.

In 1912 Haworth became a lecturer at United College of University of St Andrews in Scotland and became interested in carbohydrate chemistry, which was being investigated at St Andrews by Thomas Purdie (1843–1916) and James Irvine (1877–1952). Haworth began his work on simple sugars in 1915 and developed a new method for the preparation of the methyl ethers of sugars using methyl sulfate and alkali (now called Haworth methylation). He then began studies on the structural features of the disaccharides. Haworth organised the laboratories at St Andrews University for the production of chemicals and drugs for the British government during World War I (1914–1918).

He was appointed Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Armstrong College (Newcastle upon Tyne) of Durham University in 1920. The next year Haworth was appointed Head of the Chemistry Department at the college. It was during his time in the North East of England that he married Violet Chilton Dobbie.
In 1925 he was appointed Mason Professor of Chemistry at the University of Birmingham (a position he held until 1948). Among his lasting contributions to science was the confirmation of a number of structures of optically active sugars: by 1928, he had deduced and confirmed, among others, the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. He published a classic text in 1929, &quot;The Constitution of Sugars&quot;.

In 1933, working with the then Assistant Director of Research (later Sir) Edmund Hirst and a team led by post-doctoral student Maurice Stacey (who in 1956 rose to the same Mason Chair), having properly deduced the correct structure and optical-isomeric nature of vitamin C, Haworth reported the synthesis of the vitamin. Haworth had been given his initial reference sample of &quot;water-soluble vitamin C&quot; or &quot;hexuronic acid&quot; (the previous name for the compound as extracted from natural products) by Hungarian physiologist Albert Szent-Györgyi, who had codiscovered its vitamin properties along with Charles Glen King, and had more recently discovered that it could be extracted in bulk from Hungarian paprika. In honour of the compound&#x27;s antiscorbutic properties, Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed the new name of &quot;a-scorbic acid&quot; for the molecule, with L-ascorbic acid as its formal chemical name. During World War II, he was a member of the MAUD Committee which oversaw research on the British atomic bomb project.

== Recognition ==
Haworth is commemorated at the University of Birmingham in the Haworth Building, which houses most of the University of Birmingham School of Chemistry. The School has a Haworth Chair of Chemistry, held by Professor Nigel Simpkins from 2007 until his retirement in 2017, and by Professor Neil Champness since 2021.

In 1977 the Royal Mail issued a postage stamp (one of a series of four) featuring Haworth&#x27;s achievement in synthesising vitamin C and his Nobel prize.

He also developed a simple method of representing on paper the three-dimensional structure of sugars. The representation, using perspective, now known as a Haworth projection, is still widely used in biochemistry.

==Personal life==
In 1922 he married Violet Chilton Dobbie, daughter of Sir James Johnston Dobbie. They had two sons, James and David.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1928.

He was knighted in the 1947 New Years Honours list.

He died suddenly from a heart attack on 19 March 1950, his 67th birthday.

<text>Sir Ronald Darling Wilson, (23 August 192215 July 2005) was a distinguished Australian lawyer, judge and social activist serving on the High Court of Australia between 1979 and 1989 and as the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission between 1990 and 1997.

Wilson is probably best known as the co-author with Mick Dodson of the 1997 &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report into the Stolen Generation which led to the creation of a National Sorry Day and a walk for reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 2000 with an estimated people participating. Wilson was also one of three judges sitting on The WA Inc Royal Commission in the early 1990s which eventually led to former Premier Brian Burke being jailed in March 1997.

==Early life and academic background==
Wilson was born in Geraldton, in Western Australia (WA) on 23 August 1922. His early life was marked by sorrow and hardship. When he was four years old his mother died. At the age of seven his father, also a lawyer, suffered a stroke and spent the next five years in a hospice. His older brother became a father figure to him and for years the family faced financial struggles. At the age of 14, Wilson left formal schooling and took his first job as a messenger with the Geraldton Local Court.

In September 1941, following the outbreak of World War II, Wilson enlisted in the army reserve, which was known at the time as the Militia (service no. W46518) and was posted to the 44th Battalion. The battalion was part of a Special Mobile Force stationed in coastal areas between Perth and Geraldton, to respond in the event of an attack by Japanese forces.

Transferring to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in July 1942, Wilson (service no. 427404) received pilot training under the Empire Air Training Scheme, and was posted to the UK, for operations with Royal Air Force (RAF) formations. At the end of the war he was serving with No. 287 Squadron RAF, an anti-aircraft cooperation unit (i.e. it assisted in the training of anti-aircraft gunners). Wilson flew Spitfires, among other types of aircraft. He was discharged from the RAAF on 14 February 1946, with the rank of Flying Officer.

After returning to Australia, Wilson enrolled in the University of Western Australia finishing with a law degree in 1949. He later completed a Master of Laws degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957, as a Fulbright scholar.

==Early legal career==
Wilson was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in 1951. He had a rapid rise in his legal career, becoming Crown Prosecutor for Western Australia in 1959, only eight years after starting work as a lawyer. In 1963, he was admitted as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, at the time, the youngest ever in Western Australia. As a prosecutor, Wilson earned the nickname of the &quot;Avenging Angel&quot;.

In 2002 and 2005 two men he had prosecuted for murder have had their convictions overturned: John Button, who was convicted in 1963 of the manslaughter of his girlfriend Rosemary Anderson had his conviction overturned by the Western Australian Court of Appeal. Darryl Beamish who had been convicted of the 1959 murder of Jillian Brewer had his conviction overturned in 2005. Perth serial killer, Eric Edgar Cooke, confessed to both offences before he was hanged for other murders, but was not believed by authorities. The convictions were eventually overturned in 2002.

In 1969, Wilson became the Solicitor-General of Western Australia. He served in that position for ten years working under both Labor and Liberal governments.

==High Court Justice, 1979-1989==

The Fraser Government appointed Wilson to the High Court of Australia in 1979 and was the first member of the Court from Western Australia. Wilson adopted a federalist position on the court; and was frequently in the minority on issues relating to the scope of the Commonwealth&#x27;s external affairs legislative power.

In &quot;Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen&quot;, Wilson was in the minority in holding that the external affairs power in the Australian constitution applied only to relationships outside Australia. The majority of the High Court found that the treaty need only apply to issues of clear international concern. The majority held the Federal Parliament had the power to pass the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; as a result of Australia being a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

In &quot;Commonwealth v Tasmania&quot;, the external affairs power was again the central issue. The new Hawke Government had used the external affairs power as the basis for passing legislation preventing the Tasmanian Government from building a hydro-electric dam on the Franklin River. Wilson considered that the external affairs power did not give the Federal Parliament authority to pass such legislation as it could obtain power to pass any form of legislation it wished by simply entering into a treaty with another power. Chief Justice Harry Gibbs and Daryl Dawson were the other judges joining Wilson in the dissenting judgement.

Wilson dissented on the first Mabo case of 1988, with the majority finding that the , which attempted to retrospectively abolish native title rights, was not valid according to the .

Wilson retired from the High Court in 1989, aged 67 years.

==Commissioner, 1990-1997==

In 1990 the Hawke Government appointed Wilson as the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, where he served until his retirement in 1997. During his term as Human Right Commissioner, Wilson also served as Deputy Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1991 to 1994.

Wilson was Chancellor of Murdoch University between 1980 and 1995. The &quot;Ronald Wilson Prize in Law&quot; was first awarded by Murdoch University in 1993 to the graduate who best combines distinguished academic performance in law units with qualities of character, leadership and all-round contribution to the life of the university.

===&quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report===
Wilson and Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal Social Justice Commissioner, jointly led the National Inquiry into the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families and communities. Wilson and Dodson visited every state in Australia over the 17-month duration of the Inquiry and heard testimony from 535 aboriginals with 600 more making submissions. Wilson wrote after the completion of the report: &quot;In chairing the National Inquiry (...) I had to relate to hundreds of stories of personal devastation, pain and loss. It was a life-changing experience.&quot; The Inquiry produced a report called &quot;Bringing Them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families&quot; which was tabled in Federal Parliament. &quot;Between 1910 and 1970, up to 100,000 Aboriginal children were taken from their parents and put in white foster homes&quot;. It found that Australia was in breach of international law, called for a national compensation fund and recommended a national &quot;sorry day&quot;.

The report was welcomed by Aboriginal Australians but widely criticised by conservatives. Anthropologist Ron Brunton said the claims of genocide were an &quot;embellishment&quot;; with social commentator Robert Manne and academic Hal Wootten disputing Brunton&#x27;s claims. The Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, refused to issue an apology instead stating his regret. The Parliaments of NSW, Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria passed motions apologising for the maltreatment. The first National Sorry Day was held in 1998 and attracted widespread participation while, in 2000, an estimated people walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of reconciliation. In 2008, Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister issued an apology to the Stolen Generation on behalf of the Australian people.

===The WA Inc Royal Commission===
Carmen Lawrence appointed Wilson as one of the three eminent jurists conducting The WA Inc Royal Commission. The Royal Commission was chaired by Geoffrey Kennedy and the third member was Peter Brinsden with a brief &quot;to inquire into and report&quot; whether there had been &quot;corruption, illegal conduct, improper conduct, or bribery&quot; on the part of any person or corporation in the &quot;affairs, investment decisions and business dealings of the Government of Western Australia or its agencies&quot;. In its 1992 report, the Royal Commission said &quot;The commission has found conduct and practices on the part of certain persons involved in government in the period 1983 to 1989 such as to place our government system at risk.&quot; It was particularly critical of the behaviour of former Premier Brian Burke who was subsequently convicted for two years on charges of fraudulent behavior in 1994.

==Church and social leadership==
Throughout his life, Wilson was an active participant in first the Presbyterian Church of Australia and then the Uniting Church in Australia. He held a range of senior positions in the Church including Moderator of Assembly, Presbyterian Church in Western Australia (1965); Moderator, Synod of Western Australia, Uniting Church in Australia (1977-1979); President of the Assembly, Uniting Church in Australia (1988-1991), the first layperson to hold that post; and President of the Australian Chapter of the World Conference on Religion and Peace (1991-1996).

He was particularly concerned with encouraging the broad Australian community to gain an understanding of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history. In retirement, he travelled widely to Aboriginal and church events, and was an active member of a refugee education scheme near his home.

==Honours==
In 1978 Wilson was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for services to the community in Western Australia. The following year he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for services as a Justice of the High Court of Australia. On 26 January 1988, Wilson was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to the law.

In addition, Wilson was awarded the Centenary Medal on 1 January 2001 for service as a Justice of the High Court of Australia and to human rights.

He has been conferred with honorary degrees from the University of Western Australia (Doctor of Laws), Keimyung University (Doctor of Education), and Murdoch University (Doctor of the University).

==Personal life==
Sir Ronald married Leila Smith in April 1950; and together they had five children and nine grandchildren.

<doc id="553533" wikidata="Q1722406" url="?curid=553533" title="Receptionist">
<text>A receptionist is an employee taking an office or administrative support position. The work is usually performed in a waiting area such as a lobby or front office desk of an organization or business. The title &quot;receptionist&quot; is attributed to the person who is employed by an organization to receive or greet any visitors, patients, or clients and answer telephone calls. The term front desk is used in many hotels for an administrative department where a receptionist&#x27;s duties also may include room reservations and assignment, guest registration, cashier work, credit checks, key control, and mail and message service. Such receptionists are often called &quot;front desk clerks&quot;. Receptionists cover many areas of work to assist the businesses they work for, including setting appointments, filing, record keeping, and other office tasks.

==Responsibilities ==

The business duties of a receptionist may include answering visitors&#x27; enquiries about a company and its products or services, directing visitors to their destinations, sorting and handing out mail, answering incoming calls on multi-line telephones or, earlier in the 20th century, a switchboard, setting appointments, filing, records keeping, keyboarding/data entry and performing a variety of other office tasks, such as faxing or emailing. Some receptionists may also perform bookkeeping or cashiering duties. Some, but not all, offices may expect the receptionist to serve coffee or tea to guests, and to keep the lobby area tidy.

A receptionist may also assume some security guard access control functions for an organization by verifying employee identification, issuing visitor passes, and observing and reporting any unusual or suspicious persons or activities. 

A receptionist is often the first business contact a person will meet at any organization. Organizations usually expect that the receptionist maintains a calm, courteous and professional demeanor at all times, regardless of the visitor&#x27;s behavior. Some personal qualities that a receptionist is expected to possess in order to do the job successfully include attentiveness, a well-groomed appearance, initiative, loyalty, maturity, respect for confidentiality and discretion, a positive attitude and dependability. At times, the job may be stressful due to interaction with many different people with different types of personalities, and being expected to perform multiple tasks quickly.

==Opportunities for advancement==

Depending on the industry a receptionist position can have opportunities for networking in order to advance to other positions within a specific field. Some people may use this type of job as a way to familiarize themselves with office work, or to learn of other functions or positions within a corporation. Some people use receptionist work as a way to earn money while pursuing further educational opportunities or other career interests such as in the performing arts or as writers.

While many persons working as receptionists continue in that position throughout their careers, some receptionists may advance to other administrative jobs, such as a customer service representative, dispatcher, interviewers, secretary, production assistant, personal assistant, or executive assistant. In smaller businesses, such as a doctor&#x27;s or a lawyer&#x27;s office, a receptionist may also be the office manager who is charged with a diversity of middle management level business operations. For example, in the hotel industry, the night-time receptionist&#x27;s role is almost always combined with performing daily account consolidation and reporting, more particularly known as night auditing.

When receptionists leave the job, they often enter other career fields such as sales and marketing, public relations or other media occupations.

A few famous people were receptionists in the beginning, such as Betty Williams, a co-recipient of the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize. A number of celebrities had worked as receptionists before they became famous, such as singer/songwriter Naomi Judd and Linda McCartney, photographer, entrepreneur and wife of Paul McCartney. Other famous people who began their careers as receptionists or worked in the field include civil rights activist Rosa Parks and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.

==Evolution and new technology==
Some small-to-medium-sized business owners hire a live remote receptionist in lieu of a full-time, in-house receptionist, thanks to advances in communications technology. As the phrase itself suggests, a live remote receptionist deals with phone calls for a company in another location using telephony private branch exchange (PBX) servers. Most modern receptionist services can take messages, screen and forward calls, answer basic FAQs, and fill out web forms. Many services can also schedule appointments and take credit card orders. Some of the older receptionist services have been around for decades, but these often operate very differently from modern services.

Advances in touch screen and 2-way video technology is changing the way some receptionist work. New types of virtual video receptionist systems now allows for live, in-house or remote receptionists to manage office lobby areas from remote locations. These virtual receptionists not only answer phones but also greet walk-in visitors by utilizing a motion detection camera to &quot;see&quot; visitors as they enter the building. The remote receptionist is then displayed in a video window on a wall-mounted LCD, kiosk or desktop all-in-one computer. The video receptionist and visitors can then communicate via 2-way video, allowing the receptionist to manage one or many office lobby areas from a central location.

The advancement of office automation has eliminated some receptionists&#x27; jobs. For example, a telephone call could be answered by an automated attendant. However, a receptionist who possesses strong office/technical skills and who is also adept in courtesy, tact and diplomacy is still considered an asset to a company&#x27;s business image, and is still very much in demand in the business world.

<doc id="553545" wikidata="Q1437271" url="?curid=553545" title="Forever Young (Alphaville album)">
<text>Forever Young is the debut studio album by German synth-pop band Alphaville. It was released on 27 September 1984 by Warner Music Group. Four singles supported the album: &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, &quot;Sounds Like a Melody&quot;, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, and &quot;Jet Set&quot;. The album charted well, hitting the top 20 in six European countries and reaching number 1 in Norway and Sweden. Alphaville followed up with their second album in 1986 with the release of &quot;Afternoons in Utopia&quot;.

The album was re-released in a &quot;super deluxe&quot; edition in March 2019.

==Background==
The band released the single &quot;Big in Japan&quot; before the album had finished recording, and its success surprised the band and label. The band said, &quot;&#x27;[Big in Japan]&#x27; beamed us up into showbiz heaven, half of the album was still to be written. So, while we were in the middle of composing and arranging the residual songs, we were sort of overtaken by our future selves. … Once we wore tattered jeans and sweaty leather jacks … now we were homeless millionaires living in hotel suites and airports.&quot; Their sudden and unexpected success affected the rest of the album. In 1986, singer Marian Gold recalled that he &quot;bought an album of an unknown British band named Big in Japan. As you know, there&#x27;s a considerable musical market in Japan. If you wanted to become famous, what you should do was to form a hard rock group and then release an album over there; it would definitely sell well... so the story went ... The statement fitted well to my storyline about a couple of drug addicted lovers and moreover provided the title for the prospective song.&quot;

The first three tracks the band recorded were &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, &quot;Seeds&quot;, which was released as the B-side to &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, and &quot;Forever Young&quot;, which was originally recorded as an up-tempo track. The band was not happy with the fast version of &quot;Forever Young&quot;, and the recording of the track had come to a halt while the band figured out what to do with the song. It was producer Andreas Budde who suggested turning the track into a ballad, which is how the song was released.

The band had planned to release &quot;Forever Young&quot; as their second single, to follow the success of &quot;Big in Japan&quot;. However, record studio executives requested that the band release an additional song between the two singles, and as a result, &quot;Sounds Like a Melody&quot; was written and arranged in just two days. Of the experience, Gold said &quot;the whole affair felt like an insult to our naive hippie instincts. Writing music exclusively for the sake of commercial success seemed like the sell-out of our virtual beliefs. On the other hand, did this not open up possibilities for wonderful games to play in the brave new world of pop music?&quot;. This corporate pressure caused Gold to dislike the song and he refused to play it live for over 15 years.

Some songs they wrote for the album were sung in German (&quot;Blauer Engel&quot;, &quot;Traumtänzer&quot;, and &quot;Leben Ohne Ende&quot;), but none of the songs ended up making it on the actual release, instead being released as B-sides or on later retrospective albums. Colin Pearson, who co-produced the album, said that Marian Gold would occasionally have problems with lyrics, and then he would remember that Gold was writing in a foreign language.

Band member Bernhard Lloyd said the album was recorded using equipment such as the Roland TR-808 and Linn LM-1 drum machines, a Roland System-100M, an ARP String Ensemble and a Roland SDE 200 Digital Delay machine. The album was recorded on Tascam 8-track tapes, and they used a Friendchip SRC machine to synchronize all the tracks.

The iconic cover art for the album is by .

==Songs==
The song &quot;Summer in Berlin&quot; contains references to the East German uprising of 1953, which occurred on 17 June 1953. When the compilation album &quot;Alphaville Amiga Compilation&quot; was assembled for release in East Germany in 1988, the song &quot;Summer in Berlin&quot; was submitted for inclusion, but rejected &quot;for political reasons.&quot;

&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; was written after &quot;Big in Japan&quot; was released, and the band said &quot;everything changes when you&#x27;re number one. The world becomes a big shopping mall where all is for free, people, objects, what-ever. There is something vulgar about all this.&quot;

In 1988, Gold said that &quot;&#x27;In the Mood&#x27; is very likely about us, about how we felt in 1984, though we didn&#x27;t realize that when we wrote it. The rocket-like success of &quot;Big in Japan&quot; was mind-blowing and irritating at the same time and we were scandalized by a horror of losing our artistic innocence ever since we had signed that record-deal.&quot;

On the song &quot;The Jet Set&quot;, Gold said of the song, &quot;We didn&#x27;t intend to write a proper song; it was supposed to be some kind of jingle that advertises things money can&#x27;t buy: anarchy, freedom, love, fun and a piece of the end of the world.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Reviews were generally positive, with one reviewer calling it &quot;a classic synth pop album&quot; and &quot;a wonderfully fun ride from start to finish.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The album fared well in parts of Europe, but it failed to make an impact on the UK charts or in the US, faring no better than number 180.

The single &quot;Big in Japan&quot; made a surprise entry onto the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 66, where it stayed on the chart for several weeks.

Although the title track &quot;Forever Young&quot; was re-released several times as a single by the band&#x27;s label in the hope of it becoming a hit in the United States, it did not reach any higher than number 65 on the Hot 100. Although it reached one position higher than &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, it quickly fell into obscurity and &quot;Big in Japan&quot; remains their biggest-selling single in the US. &quot;Big in Japan&quot; also managed to peak at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, while &quot;Forever Young&quot; was also considered a commercial failure there, reaching number 98.

==Re-release==
On 15 March 2019, the album was remastered for the first time for its 35th anniversary. The package comes with two additional CDs, one with original single versions, B-sides and remixes and the other with 16 original demos. The other disc is a DVD that includes a 60-minute documentary and promo videos. There is also a super deluxe edition that includes the new remaster on vinyl and comes with a 24-page vinyl-sized booklet, created by the art director of the original album in close collaboration with the band and contains a variety of rare and unpublished photos, sleeve notes and various other testimonies.

<doc id="553547" wikidata="Q1369202" url="?curid=553547" title="NEC V20">
<text>The NEC V20 is a microprocessor that was designed and produced by NEC. It is both pin compatible and object-code compatible with the Intel 8088, with an instruction set architecture (ISA) similar to that of the Intel 80188 with some extensions. The V20 was introduced in March 1984.

== Features ==
The V20&#x27;s die comprised 63,000 transistors; more than double the 29,000 of the 8088 CPU. The chip was designed for a clock duty cycle of 50%, compared to the 33% duty cycle used by the 8088. The V20 has two 16-bit wide internal databuses, allowing two data transfers to occur concurrently. Differences like that meant that a V20 could typically complete more instructions in a given time than an Intel 8088 running at the same frequency.

The V20 was fabricated in 2-micron CMOS technology. Early versions ran at speeds of 5, 8, and 10 MHz. In 1990, an upgrade to the fabrication process technology resulted in the V20H and V20HL, with improved performance and reduced power consumption. Later versions added speeds of 12 and 16 MHz. The V20HLs were also completely static, allowing their clock to be stopped.

The V20 was described as 16-bits wide internally. It used an 8-bit external data bus that was multiplexed onto the same pins as the low byte of the address bus. Its 20-bit wide address bus was able to address 1 MB of memory.

The V20 was reported to have been compatible with the Intel 8087 floating-point unit (FPU) coprocessor. NEC also designed their own FPU, the , which was cancelled before reaching production. They followed this with a revised design, the μPD72191, but it is unclear how many, if any, of this second part were produced.

The V30, a nearly identical CPU with a 16-bit wide external data bus, debuted on March 1, 1984. It was pin and object-code compatible with the Intel 8086.

==ISA extensions==

The V20&#x27;s ISA includes several instructions not executed by the 8088, with instructions for bit manipulation, packed BCD operations, multiplication, and division. They also include new real-mode instructions from the Intel 80286.

The codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 instructions were able to add, subtract, and compare huge packed binary-coded decimal numbers stored in memory. Instructions codice_4 and codice_5 rotate four-bit nibbles. Another family consisted of the codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, and codice_9 instructions, which test, set, clear, and invert single bits of their operands, but are far less efficient than the later i80386 equivalents codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, and codice_13; neither are their encodings compatible. There were two instructions to extract and insert bit fields of arbitrary lengths (codice_14, codice_15). And finally, there were two additional repeat prefixes, codice_16 and codice_17, which amended the original codice_18 and codice_19 instructions for scanning a string of bytes or words (with instructions codice_20 and codice_21) while a less or not less condition remained true.

The V20 offered a mode that emulated an Intel 8080 CPU. A codice_22 instruction is issued to start 8080 emulation. The operand of the instruction specifies an interrupt number whose vector contains the segment:offset where emulation is to begin. To end, a codice_23 instruction is issued in 8080 code. One feature not often employed is the codice_24 (call native) which issues an 8086-type interrupt call that enables x86 code (which returns using an codice_25) to be mixed in with 8080 code.

Another mode put the processor into a power-saving state via a codice_26 instruction.

== Lawsuits ==
In 1982, Intel sued NEC over the latter&#x27;s μPD8086 and μPD8088. This suit was settled out of court, with NEC agreeing to license the designs from Intel.

In late 1984, Intel again filed suit against NEC, claiming that the microcode in the V20 and V30 infringed its patents for the 8088 and 8086 processors. NEC software engineer Hiroaki Kaneko had studied both the hardware design of the Intel CPUs and the original Intel microcode.

In its ruling, the court determined that the microcode in the control store constitutes a computer program, and so is protected by copyright. They further found Intel to have forfeited their copyright by neglecting to ensure that all second-source chips were suitably marked. The court also determined that NEC did not simply copy Intel&#x27;s microcode, and that the microcode in the V20 and V30 was sufficiently different from Intel&#x27;s to not infringe Intel&#x27;s patents.

The judge in the case accepted NEC&#x27;s &quot;cleanroom&quot; evidence. He also approved of NEC&#x27;s use of reverse engineering with respect to the creation of NEC&#x27;s Rev.2 microcode, without commenting on it with respect to the Rev.0 code.

<text>USS &quot;Briscoe&quot; (DD-977), named after Admiral Robert Pearce Briscoe USN, was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was laid down 21 July 1975, launched 28 December 1976 and commissioned 3 June 1978. The ship operated from Norfolk, Virginia during her entire 25-year career. When decommissioned, she was part of Destroyer Squadron 22.

==History==

&quot;Briscoe&quot; conducted firing trials in 1981–1982 in support of the SALGP (Semi-Active Laser Guided Projectile) off the coast of Vieques, Puerto Rico. These projectiles were fired from the 5 inch (127 mm) gun at a range in excess of . While in flight, an optical sensor would detect the signature of a laser-painted target on shore and convert the shell to an actively homing rocket for pinpoint destruction of moving and stationary targets on shore.
Participated in Operation Urgent Fury, the liberation of Grenada, and in the Multi-National Peacekeeping Forces off the coast of Lebanon, and in Baltic Operations 1990. &quot;Briscoe&quot; also participated as a member of Middle East Forces deploying twice to the North Red Sea conducting Maritime Interception Operations in support of U.N. sanctions against Iraq. &quot;Briscoe&quot; established a U.S. record of 275 merchant vessel boardings in the North Red Sea during the first of her two deployments to the area.

In her second North Red Sea deployment in March 1994, &quot;Briscoe&quot; responded to a distress call on 19 May 1994 from an Egyptian passenger ferry, the Al-Qamar Al-Saudi Al-Misri. Briscoe acted as the On-Scene Commander for the ensuing rescue efforts for the over 500 passengers, coordinating the actions of the numerous vessels in the area.

In 1996, &quot;Briscoe&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean and Black Sea for a six-month period. Deployed with Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 44 (Detachment 5), &quot;Briscoe&quot; in Exercise Atlas Hinge with the Tunisian navy and Exercise Shark Hunt and Jaws, an undersea warfare exercise against U.S. submarines in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean Sea.

&quot;Briscoe&quot; took part in Exercise Classica 96, from 31 August through 9 September, in the spirit of Partnership for Peace. Ships from the U.S. 6th Fleet, Black Sea and Mediterranean littoral nations (including Italy, Ukraine, Greece.

In 1999, at President Bill Clinton&#x27;s orders, warships of the U.S. Navy assisted in the search for the crashed plane of John F. Kennedy Jr. With the permission of Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a public memorial service for Kennedy was held aboard the &quot;Briscoe&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.
Routine deployment workups were interrupted in 2001, as &quot;Briscoe&quot; responded to help provide aerial defense of the U.S. East Coast after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2002, &quot;Briscoe&quot; deployed as part of the Harry S. Truman Battle Group in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;Briscoe&quot; was one of the first ships to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles on targets in Iraq, firing in total 25 missiles.

&quot;Briscoe&quot; was decommissioned 2 October 2003. She was disposed of as a target in support of a fleet training exercise on 25 August 2005. She lies at at a depth of .

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The ship&#x27;s coat of arms is a reflection of the naval career of Admiral Robert Pearce Briscoe.

Standing boldly at the base of the shield is the Lion of St. Mark, which refers to the Admiral&#x27;s leadership as Commander in Chief of Allied Southern Forces Europe. The fess and wavy bar, immediately above the Lion of St. Mark, suggest flowing water passing warships and small land areas. This is reminiscent of the Northern Solomon Islands where Admiral Briscoe commanded the in World War II several important engagements. The shield is completed by four stars, symbolic of Admiral Briscoe&#x27;s leadership achievement and rank.

Atop the shield is a crest symbolic of further achievement in a long and successful career. The trident, symbol of Triton, ruler of the seas, refers to the United States Naval Academy where the Admiral served as a student, instructor and department head. The flash represents Prometheus&#x27; gift of science to mankind and alludes to Admiral Briscoe as one of the pioneers of modern electronics development in the Navy. The cross refers to the Navy Cross Admiral Briscoe received for his actions in the North Solomon Campaign. The crest is completed by the Taegeuk which denotes the Admiral&#x27;s Far East Naval Command.

The coat of arms is summed up by the ship&#x27;s motto &quot;Efficiency and Valor&quot;, given to the ship by former chief of naval operations, Admiral Robert Carney, as a tribute to his close friend.

<text>Damage Incorporated is a first-person shooter for Mac OS using the &quot;Marathon 2&quot; engine and published by MacSoft in 1997. It was ported to Microsoft Windows.

==Gameplay==
The player commands a squad of four marines in counter-terrorism operations. Visuals are displayed using the &quot;Marathon&quot; engine&#x27;s multi-floor 2.5D system. It includes a networked deathmatch mode.

==Reception==
&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;If you enjoy first-person shooters, you&#x27;re going to find a lot to like about this.&quot;

&quot;MacHome Journal&quot; chose &quot;Damage Incorporated&quot; for the &quot;Best Action Game&quot; category in their &quot;Home Choice Awards.&quot; They wrote, &quot;With the incorporation of the teamwork concept into a 3-D shooter, &quot;Damage Incorporated&quot; provides additional strategy and immersiveness in an exhilarating marine strike force game for a mere $30.&quot;

&quot;MacWorld&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Damage Incorporated&quot;&#x27;s creator admits he has no real military knowledge, and it shows.&quot; The reviewer concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s a valiant attempt to advance the first-person shooter genre by incorporating a strategic element, but poor design and uneven implementation sabotage it.&quot;
