<text>The Kai Islands (also Kei Islands) of Indonesia are a group of islands in the southeastern part of the Maluku Islands, located in the province of Maluku. The Moluccas have been known as the Spice Islands due to regionally specific plants such as nutmeg, mace, and cloves that originally intrigued the European nations of the 16th century. The coastal zone of the islands are identified as a site of highest marine biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle.

== Geography ==

The Kai Islands are a part of the Wallacea, the group of Indonesian islands that are separated by deep water from both the Asian and Australian continental shelves, and were never linked to either continent. As a result, the Kai Islands have few native mammals and are a part of the Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. Kai Besar in particular is mountainous and densely forested. Kai is famous for the beauty of its beaches, notably in Pasir Panjang.

The indigenous inhabitants call the islands Nuhu Evav (Evav Islands) or Tanat Evav (Evav Land), but they are known as Kai to people from neighboring islands. The islands are on the edge of the Banda Sea, south of the Bird&#x27;s Head Peninsula of New Guinea, west of the Aru Islands, and northeast of the Tanimbar Islands.

The Kai islands are made up of numerous islands, including:

Within southeast Maluku Regency:
* Kai Besar or Nuhu Yuut or Nusteen (Great Kai)
* Kai Kecil or Nuhu Roa or Nusyanat (Little Kai)
* Tanimbar Kai or Tnebar Evav
Within the city of Tual:
* Kai Dulah or Du
* Dulah Laut or Du Roa
* Kuur
* Taam
* Tayandu Islands (Tahayad)

The Kai Islands&#x27; total land area is and had a population of 154,524 at the 2010 Census, including the independent city of Tual; the 2020 Census gave a figure of 209,791. By mid-2022 this had increased to an officially estimated 217,344.

== Climate ==
The Kai Islands reside in a topical zone in close proximity to the equator, leading to an average temperature of , and an average low of . During the months from April to September, the islands experience a dry season where rain is scarce.

=== Environmental concerns ===
A report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified an acceleration in the rate of sea level rising, potentially causing the Indonesian islands to sink. This scenario could also lead to changes in Indonesia&#x27;s territorial and maritime boundaries, posing a legal and environmental challenge for the country and threatening Indonesia&#x27;s status as an archipelagic country.

== Administrative divisions ==
The Kai Islands consist of the two distinct second-tier administrations, both in Maluku Province. The Southeast Maluku Regency (Maluku Tenggara) is sub-divided into eleven administrative districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;); its administrative centre is the town of Langpur. Though it is geographically in the Kai Islands, the city of Tual forms a separate regency-level administration and is not part of the Southeast Maluku Regency. It includes a number of islands in the geographical Kai Islands, and it is itself sub-divided into five districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;).

These two entities, with their administrative capitals, are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2022:

== Culture ==
=== History ===

Local history holds that ancestors of contemporary Kai islanders came from Bali, part of the expanding Majapahit kingdom from the western archipelago. The village of Ohoi-Ewur (first Raja Ewab: Raja Ohoi-Ewur = Raja Tabtut) on Kai Kecil or Nuhuroa island was the arrival point for the Balinese aristocrats and their army. They stayed in the village with local residents. As a result, Ohoi-Ewur became a seat of government, where the local law (&quot;Larvul Ngabal&quot;) – Red Blood and Balinese Spear – was developed at the initiative of the royal princess Dit Sakmas.

Evidence for these stories include an inheritance and a harbor named &#x27;Bal Sorbay&#x27; (Bali Surabaya) on Kai Kecil which is, presumably, the harbor at which the royals arrived.

It is recognized by Kai islanders that some of their ancestors came from other places such as Sumbawa island (Sumbau), Buton (Vutun) in Sulawesi, Seram (Seran) and Gorom (Ngoran) islands in the Central Moluccas, and the sultanates of Jailolo (Dalo) and Ternate (Ternat) as well.

The tiny island of Tanimbarkei is not part of Tanimbar, as the name might suggest, but is one of the Kai Islands. It is inhabited by fewer than 1000 very traditional people. Half of the population call themselves Hindus, but are more or less practicing ancestor worship.

After the 1999 clashes between the Muslim and Christian populations in Ambon, similar inter-communal clashes swept through Kai but quickly calmed down.

All of the islands depend on 22 ratshcaap, or traditional local leaders called Rat or Raja, as kings of customary law.

=== Languages ===
The official language in the Kai Islands is Indonesian, although local languages exist between regions.

Three Austronesian languages are spoken on the Kai Islands; Keiese is the most widely spoken, in 207 villages on Kai Kecil, Kai Besar, and surrounding islands. Kurese is spoken on Kur Island and nearby Kaimeer, where Kai is used as a lingua franca. Bandanese is spoken in the villages of Banda-Eli (Wadan El) and Banda-Elat (Wadan Elat) on the west and northeastern side of Kai Besar. Banda speakers originally came from the Banda Islands, but the language is no longer spoken there.

There is no native writing system for the Keiese language. Dutch Catholic missionaries wrote the language using a variation of the Roman alphabet.

=== Musical instruments ===
Some Kai musical instruments include:

* &quot;Savarngil&quot;: A small native flute from 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) long, open at both ends with six fingerholes placed along the pip. It is made of bamboo and keyless.
* &quot;Tiva&quot;: Single headed drums, consist of a calf skin membrane which is stretched over an enclosed space or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel.
* &quot;Dada&quot;: A medium-size gong in size, with a crashing sound and a raised boss or nipple in the center.

=== Religion ===
The predominant religion in the Kai Islands is Christianity, where unlike like much of the surrounding area there are more Catholics (44%) than Protestants (26%). Consequently, the islands are regarded as the center of Catholicism in all of Maluku.

A primary minority in the region consists of Muslims (28%) and half of the people who live on the small island of Tanimbarkei practice a variant of the Hindu religion, which involves a form of ancestor worship.

=== Mythology ===
Their story of creation is an earth-diver myth that involves sending a dog down to the earth, who brings up his sandy paws. There were three brothers and two sisters in the upper sky-world. While fishing one day, Parpara, the youngest of the brothers, lost a fish-hook which he had borrowed from Hian, his oldest brother. Angered by the loss of the hook, Hian demanded that it be found and returned to him. After much fruitless search, the Parpara met a fish who asked him what his trouble was, and who, on learning the facts, promised to aid in the search. At length they discovered another fish who was very ill because of something stuck in its throat. The object proved to be the long-lost hook, which the friendly fish delivered to Parpara, who thus was able to restore it to its owner.Parpara, however, determined to have his revenge upon his brother, and so he secretly fastened a bamboo vessel full of palm liquor above Hian&#x27;s bed in such a way that when the latter rose, he would be almost certain to upset it. The expected happened, and Parpara then demanded of his brother that he return to him the spilled liquor. Hian endeavoured, of course fruitlessly, to gather it up, and in his efforts dug so deeply into the ground that he made an opening clear through the sky-world.Wondering what might lie below, the brothers determined to tie one of their dogs to a long rope and lower him through the aperture; and when they had done this, and the dog had been drawn up again, they found white sand sticking to his feet, whereupon they resolved to go down themselves, although the other inhabitants of the heaven-world refused to accompany them thither. Sliding down the rope, the three brothers and one of the sisters, together with their four dogs, safely reached the world which lay below, and which was thus discovered for the first time. As the second sister was descending, however, one of the brothers chanced to look up, at which his sister was so ashamed that she shook the rope and was hauled up by the other sky-people. In this way the three brothers with their sister were the first occupants of the world and became the ancestors of the human race.

=== Agriculture ===
The soil on Kai Kecil is of poor quality; slash-and-burn agriculture is common. Fishing is usually done around Trepang, and cultured pearls are harvested in Kai Kecil.

== Meti Kei ==
Meti Kei is an annual natural phenomenon occurring for a few weeks, and celebrated with a festival between October 22 and 23, where the ocean recedes up to 6 km, allowing for one to walk to other islands normally separated by water.

He is known for his roles in the films &quot;The Boys of St. Vincent&quot;, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, &quot;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&quot;, &quot;Fido&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, and &quot;Scream VI&quot;, in particular for his role as Eugene Kittridge in &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, as well as for numerous television programs in both guest and starring roles, including a regular role as Conrad Grayson on the ABC primetime soap opera &quot;Revenge&quot;, a loose adaptation of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. 

Czerny has received the Theatre World Award and two Gemini Awards, and was nominated for the Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;The Other Half&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Czerny was born on 8 February 1959 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the youngest of three children to Polish Canadian parents.
 His father worked as a welder, and his mother worked in a bakery.

Czerny attended York University in Toronto.

== Career ==
Czerny received formal training at the National Theatre School in Montreal. After graduating in 1982, he went on to perform onstage across Canada, from Ottawa&#x27;s National Arts Centre to Edmonton&#x27;s Citadel Theatre and the Stratford Festival.

By the late 1980s, he had established himself as a seasoned veteran of Canadian theatre—a long way from Lucky Larry, his first role. Czerny got his start acting in musicals at Humberside Collegiate Institute in Toronto, under the direction of Janet Keele. Czerny played the role of the husband of the title character in &quot;Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story&quot;.

In 2007, he appeared in the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot;, playing the Duke of Norfolk.

In 2011, Czerny was cast opposite Madeleine Stowe, as the powerful patriarch Conrad Grayson, a series regular role, in ABC soap-type series &quot;Revenge&quot;. His character was stabbed at the end of season 3 and in the first episode of the fourth season it was revealed he had died. He later returned to the series in unseen flashback sequences in one season 4 episode. In 2016, Czerny was cast in the ABC thriller series &quot;Quantico&quot; for the recurring role of CIA director Matthew Keyes.

Czerny is widely regarded as a character actor, often playing villainous, authoritative, or bureaucratic characters.

Daly was first elected to office in 2000 in a near sweep for progressive candidates in supervisorial races. He ran on his credentials as a housing advocate in the Mission District. Daly was re-elected in 2002 and 2006. Daly received 8,472, 6,642, and 8,968 votes respectively in the three contested elections.

===Housing and homelessness===
Daly&#x27;s legislative record focused primarily on housing and homelessness. He sponsored legislation to help low-income tenants of Single-room occupancy (SRO) residential hotels, many of whom were located in his district. In 2005, Daly negotiated a planned development on Rincon Hill, where the property was rezoned to allow for high-rise development in exchange for a higher percentage of affordable housing units and &quot;community benefits&quot; to non-profits in the area. Daly also received unanimous support for a plan to demolish and rebuild an apartment complex at Trinity Plaza in exchange for 590 affordable units. This was the first time in California history that a housing developer voluntarily allowed new construction to be covered by rent control.

Critics of Daly&#x27;s housing policies point to his attempt to ban tenancy-in-common apartment conversions, which they believe allow middle-income people to buy property in San Francisco.

In June 2006, Daly sponsored the Eviction Disclosure Ordinance, which required real estate agents to inform buyers whether a tenant was evicted from a property they wished to purchase. The ballot proposition won with 52 percent of the vote.

In March 2007, Daly, chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, introduced a proposal that would appropriate $28 million for affordable housing. In April 2007, Daly introduced another proposal that would appropriate an additional $15 million in services for seniors and families. Eight members of the Board of Supervisors passed the affordable housing measure, but Mayor Gavin Newsom refused to spend the money.

===Progressive convention===
In June 2007, Daly organized a &quot;Progressive Convention&quot; to find a candidate to run against popular Mayor Gavin Newsom. Daly stated that if the convention could not choose a candidate, he himself would run. But when the Progressive Convention did not nominate anyone, Daly declined to run himself. He said that he wanted to spend time with his family and that his wife was due to give birth shortly before the mayoral election.

===Elimination of Police Chief post===
Daly suggested putting a charter amendment before voters in the November 2007 municipal election calling for elimination of the police chief post. Instead, the elected sheriff would oversee all law enforcement in the city and county of San Francisco. The suggestion arose from Daly&#x27;s disagreements with Police Chief Heather Fong about the placement and use of police patrols. &quot;If they keep the attacks on me, I&#x27;ll keep moving forward what I think is good public policy,&quot; Daly said. &quot;What they fear is the end of their reign of terror in San Francisco.&quot;

===Opposition to the Blue Angels===
In June 2007, Daly announced that he was working with anti-war activist organizations such as Code Pink, Global Exchange and Veterans for Peace and considering introducing a proposal to ban the Blue Angels from flying during San Francisco&#x27;s Fleet Week. Following significant negative public response and media inquiries, Daly announced that he had decided against making this proposal, blaming reporters at the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; for his inability to move forward with this controversial proposal.

===Removal from Budget Committee chairmanship===
On June 15, 2007, Board President Aaron Peskin removed Daly as chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee shortly before it was to finalize the $6.06 billion budget proposed by Mayor Gavin Newsom. Explaining why he removed Daly, Peskin cited Daly&#x27;s bitter public conflict with the mayor over budget priorities. &quot;Fundamentally,&quot; he said, &quot;the budget process is about public policy and not about personality and it is important that we stay committed to having an outcome that ensures we have a budget that reflects the values of the people of San Francisco.&quot;

===Canceling of the San Francisco Grand Prix===
Daly, along with Aaron Peskin, was instrumental in the canceling of the San Francisco Grand Prix, a world-class bicycle race held from 2001 to 2005, because of disagreements over the amount to be paid for traffic and crowd control and because the race&#x27;s backers owed the city $89,924. In 2001 Mayor Willie Brown, who supported the race, allowed its organizers to incur a $350,000 debt and later ordered city officials to forgive that debt. Critics alleged that the race was canceled for political reasons including pressure from Peskin&#x27;s constituents over parking issues. In Daly&#x27;s personal blog, he referred to one of the chief backers of the race, San Francisco banker Thom Weisel, as a &quot;multi-millionaire Republican politico&quot;. The race, which was organized as a 1.HC event and in 2005 was part of the UCI America Tour attracted hundreds of thousands of spectators as well as world-class athletes such as seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, and was regarded as one of the country&#x27;s most challenging, particularly for its famously difficult 18% grade Fillmore and Taylor street climbs. Mayor Gavin Newsom, who also supported the race, said it provided cultural, social, and economic benefit to San Francisco. A 2005 study commissioned by the San Francisco Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau found the Labor Day weekend race generated $10.2 million for city businesses that year.

===Olympic torch resolution===
On March 20, 2008, Daly introduced a resolution which criticized the human rights record of China and urged officials representing San Francisco during the upcoming Olympic torch ceremonies (scheduled for April 9, 2008) to &quot;make publicly known that the 2008 Summer Games torch is received with alarm and protest.&quot; Daly&#x27;s resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests in relation to the Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay will be the first time in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. Daly stated, &quot;[T]he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can look you in the face and tell you the Olympics are limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that&#x27;s a good poker player.&quot; Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated &quot;free-speech zones&quot; stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t see why we should break from our pattern of how we handle mass protests or demonstrations for China.&quot; San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has &quot;very serious concerns&quot; about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is &quot;privileged&quot; to be the torch&#x27;s only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time &quot;to focus on the things that unite us and not divide us.&quot; In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend &quot;their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;

===Appointments to Public Utilities Commission ===
On October 22, 2003, during his one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown traveled to Tibet, Daly appointed two members to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown&#x27;s consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown&#x27;s absence. Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that &quot;[The appointments] were made by a person who was supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... [It was] a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city.&quot; Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, &quot;When you conspire and calculate what you intend to do several days before you&#x27;re designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It&#x27;s like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it.&quot; Brown said he found out about Daly&#x27;s actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a &quot;coup.&quot;

Nonetheless, the City Attorney stood behind its legal opinion and environmentalist and former Sierra Club president Adam Werbach was later sworn in. The second appointee, architect Robin Chiang, was rescinded because Brown had already made one appointment, Andrew Lee, son of one of Brown&#x27;s fund-raiser Julie Lee, who was convicted of mail fraud and witness tampering on July 12, 2008. Daly and his allies on the board said Andrew Lee represented political patronage at its worst. According to John Rizzo, vice chairman of the Bay chapter of the Sierra Club, Daly&#x27;s appointments would add &quot;expertise to the SFPUC that was greatly lacking and is a great improvement&quot; Brown said that Daly&#x27;s action went beyond betrayal and that he considers his relationship with Daly, who he had praised in recent months, over. The custom of assigning the acting mayor position to supervisors on a basis was discontinued as a result of Daly&#x27;s appointments. Daly said by way of explanation for his actions, &quot;I&#x27;m an activist. I had an opportunity, and I took it. I stand by what I did. It was the right thing.&quot;

===Controversies===
Daly has a reputation for having a fiery demeanor. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Daly is &quot;either a hothead or a passionate advocate—depending on whose side you are on.&quot;

In 2001, Daly nearly came to blows with Mayor Willie Brown after Daly brought homeless activists to a meeting that was supposed to be &quot;private.&quot; Asked to apologize, Daly replied, &quot;I will apologize that I was lured into the mayor&#x27;s finger-pointing politics.&quot; In November 2004, fellow supervisor Michela Alioto-Pier lodged a petition for censure against Daly after he told a landlord advocate to &quot;fuck off&quot; at a tenants&#x27; rights hearing (the petition failed by a vote of 8-2).

In 2001, Daly famously told his colleagues at a Supervisors&#x27; meeting, &quot;I&#x27;m not feeling the love,&quot; when they rejected his proposals for balancing the budget, as he stormed out of the room. In 2002, Daly was arrested after a confrontation with police over a land use dispute concerning Hastings Law School, and reportedly told the arresting officer that he would have him fired; no charges were filed.

In June 2007, after learning that an attempted budget maneuver would be unsuccessful, Daly, according to &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross, &quot;went ballistic — singling out fellow progressive leader Ross Mirkarimi for a tongue lashing so heated that fellow supervisors joked about calling in the SWAT team to cool things down&quot;.

On June 19, 2007, during a Board of Supervisors meeting, Daly suggested that Mayor Gavin Newsom uses cocaine and is a hypocrite for proposing public health cuts for substance abuse treatment for the poor. Daly stated that it was ironic of Newsom to propose cuts to a drug treatment program, &quot;while the mayor of San Francisco artfully dodges every question about allegations of his own cocaine use.&quot; The mayor&#x27;s press secretary said Daly&#x27;s remarks were &quot;sleazy politics of personal destruction.&quot; The Board of Supervisors President stated that &quot;Supervisor Daly&#x27;s comments were conduct unbecoming and do not represent the position of the Board of Supervisors or its president.&quot; The editorial board of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; recommended censuring Daly.

During an August 7, 2008, Rules Committee hearing after Daly had presented his resolution to turn the San Francisco Zoo into a rescue facility and when he was out of the room, a student from Lowell High School who had waited two hours for her chance to speak in support of the zoo, began to cry at the podium, because she, like the other speakers, was only allowed one minute to speak. Normally at Board of Supervisors hearings, speakers have 2–3 minutes to speak, but time is limited by the discretion of the chair often to shorter periods of time, especially if there are a large number of speakers. This was the second time the item had been heard in committee, and Chris Daly chose to limit public comment to one minute, so that another item regarding black flight from the City could be heard at that same hearing. Carl Friedman, the Director of the San Francisco Department of Animal Care and Control, said, &quot;There were a lot of young people there who have never been to a government meeting. For this to be their first experience was embarrassing.&quot; When asked about the situation, the student responded, &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean to cry, I just kind of lost it. I thought they were supposed to listen to us.&quot;

On April 21, 2009, at a Democratic Party fundraising lunch, members of the Building and Construction Trades Council called on Party Chairman Aaron Peskin and Daly to resign over their support for the voter-approved Historic Preservation Commission.

In 2009, questions began to arise whether Chris Daly actually lived in San Francisco. He purchased a home in Fairfield, California, and sent his family to live there. San Francisco law requires supervisors to live in the district which they represent. . On January 8, 2010, Daly announced to the Board of Supervisors&#x27; Rules Committee, &quot;I vow to use the word &quot;fuck&quot; in each of my remaining Board of Supervisors meetings.&quot;

On July 27, 2010, Daly called for at least 50 percent of proposed new Hunters Point housing be affordable. He stated that although it would be impossible for Lennar (the project&#x27;s Miami-based developer) to meet this expanded affordability requirement, that nevertheless shouldn&#x27;t be a concern. If the project becomes too expensive for local residents to move in, &quot;there&#x27;s going to be a pretty new neighborhood, with lots of white folks living in the Bayview,&quot; Daly said. Michael Cohen, head of the mayor&#x27;s Office of Economic and Workforce Development, stated that Daly&#x27;s amendment was a deal-killer, because &quot;the project is not financially viable at 50 percent affordable.&quot;

Susan King, a past spokesperson for San Francisco&#x27;s Green Party, said about Daly, &quot;At the end of the day, I totally appreciate the fact that he is out there in the trenches. It&#x27;s not 100 percent that I agree with him, but you know where his heart is and where his values are.&quot; Nathan Nayman, executive director of the Committee on Jobs (a pro-business PAC that receives contributions from corporate donors and promotes economic development
), said &quot;Chris Daly has given the Board of Supervisors a black eye that refuses to heal. He&#x27;s maniacal and he&#x27;s been given to outbursts on a regular basis.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot; says that &quot;Daly&#x27;s a hard worker, has a solid record...is popular in his district...is more than a good supervisor... He&#x27;s part of the class of 2000, one of a crew of activists who swept into power in the first district elections as a rebellion against the developer-driven politics of then-mayor Willie Brown.&quot;
The Berkeley Planet said &quot;Chris Daly [has] a strong progressive record in [his] legislative bod[y]... first elected because [he] engaged [his] district&#x27;s most disenfranchised population.&quot;

==Post-electoral career==
After leaving the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Daly moved to Fairfield, California. He purchased Buck Tavern, a bar on Market Street in San Francisco. He operated the bar until October 2012, when the lease expired and he chose not to renew. In February 2012, Daly took a job with Local 1021 of the Service Employees International Union in San Francisco. He left that job in September 2014. In 2016, he started working for the Nevada State Education Association, the state teacher union based in Las Vegas.

<text>David Frederick Malin (born 28 March 1941) is a British-Australian astronomer and photographer. He is principally known for his spectacular colour images of astronomical objects. A galaxy is named after him, Malin 1, which he discovered in 1986 and which is the largest spiral galaxy so far discovered.

==Career==
Malin was born in 1941 and raised in Heywood, Greater Manchester, in the north of England. He was trained as a chemist and originally worked as a microscopist. In 1975 he moved to Sydney to take up a job with the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), now the Australian Astronomical Observatory.

Whilst working at the AAO, Malin developed several photographic processing techniques to maximise the ability to extract faint and low contrast detail from the non-linear response and high densities of photographic plates.

These techniques were initially devised to enhance the scientific return from photography, but Malin is now best known for the series of three-colour wide field images of deep space objects which have been widely published as posters and in books around the world. Most professional astronomical photographs are monochromatic; if colour pictures are required, three images are needed. During his career at the AAO, Malin made about 150 three-colour images of deep sky objects, mostly using plates taken with the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the UK Schmidt Telescope.

The true-colour images are assembled from three separate monochromatic photographs taken through red, green and blue filters. Each photographic plate is a special black and white emulsion designed for low light conditions and is further enhanced for low light sensitivity by baking in a nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere. The exposure times are relatively long, varying between 5–60 minutes for each colour, depending on the luminosity of the object. The colour image is re-assembled in the darkroom, where further techniques such as unsharp masking to enhance fine detail might also be applied.

In 1986 he discovered Malin 1, a giant spiral galaxy located away in the constellation Coma Berenices, near the North Galactic Pole. it is the largest spiral galaxy so far discovered, with an approximate diameter of .

Since the early 1990s, silver-based astrophotography has been largely superseded by digital sensors, but many of the technical advances Malin introduced to the field have been carried over to processing astrophotography on computers.

Malin has published over 250 academic papers on the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and ten books.

In 2001 he retired from the AAO to concentrate on his own business, David Malin Images, which manages his image collection along with those of related photographers.

<text>William Charles DeMott II (born November 10, 1966) is an American retired professional wrestler, road agent, and trainer. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Hugh Morrus and World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) under his real name. DeMott also performed as Crash the Terminator in both Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Japan.

Generally used as a jobber to the stars in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion&#x27;s dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship twice. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company&#x27;s &quot;Tough Enough&quot; program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE&#x27;s developmental territories Deep South Wrestling, Florida Championship Wrestling, and NXT; after working for WWE a total of 14 years between 2001 and 2015. In 2015, he resigned from his role in response to numerous allegations of misconduct in relation throughout his role as trainer in various WWE developmental territories.

==Early life==
William Charles DeMott II was born on November 10, 1966, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He grew up in Paramus, New Jersey, graduating from Paramus High School in 1983.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1988–1996)===
DeMott was trained by Johnny Rodz in Rodz&#x27;s New York City wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the Americas Wrestling Federation and started using the name Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found partial success, first capturing the AWF World Heavyweight Title from Steve Strong in Puerto Rico, before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning the World Tag Team Championship with Mr. Pogo. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.

On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation at a Monday Night Raw taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He competed in two other matches at a two day taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge. He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where he won the latter promotion&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a battle royal in 1995.

===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993–1994)===
He wrestled for Eastern Championship Wrestling for a short time under his &quot;Crash the Terminator&quot; name. At Ultimate Jeopardy in March 1994 he defeated the Pitbull. His final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995–2001)===

====Dungeon of Doom (1995–1998)====

In 1995, DeMott was signed to a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) contract at the behest of Kevin Sullivan who had been impressed by him. He debuted in dark matches as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange gimmick that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of The Dungeon of Doom as &quot;The Laughing Man&quot; Hugh Morrus (a pun on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a vignette inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his (kayfabe) father, The Master, that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him &quot;the man from the Isle of Nowhere.&quot;

====First Family (1997–2000)====

Upon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom in mid-1997, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to Bill Goldberg during the September 22, 1997 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

As a part of the growing hardcore wrestling style in WCW, Morrus joined Jimmy Hart&#x27;s First Family stable in 1998. Although the Family found success and received a push following a victory over their rivals The Revolution, the stable was suddenly disbanded in 1999. At this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW.

====Misfits In Action (2000–2001)====

DeMott returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but squashing a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.

After getting on Russo&#x27;s bad side (in kayfabe), Morrus was fired from his New Blood stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Booker T) formed the comedic Misfits in Action stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable&#x27;s leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against Filthy Animals.

The group&#x27;s comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel Team Canada, the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada&#x27;s leader and United States Heavyweight Champion Lance Storm, with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a turncoat &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan in a handicap match on October 29 at Halloween Havoc to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at Mayhem.

After his feud with Storm, the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; Bill Goldberg grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said &quot;Hey, Goldberg&#x27;s streak had to start somewhere, my friend.&quot;

At Sin on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to Shane Douglas. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were honorably discharged, which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) bought out WCW.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2008)===

====The Alliance (2001–2002)====
When WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of The Invasion angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of The Alliance. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; by attacking Edge. Aside from a pay-per-view match at Invasion on July 22 where he, Shawn Stasiak and Chris Kanyon defeated Big Show, Billy Gunn and Albert and an Intercontinental Championship match on the August 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; which he lost to Edge via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company&#x27;s secondary shows &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Jakked&quot; much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he took on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at Survivor Series following Team Alliance&#x27;s loss to Team WWF, Morrus was kayfabe fired by Vince McMahon. While off television, Morrus performed at house shows and worked in company&#x27;s developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with Raven to defeat Lance Cade and Steve Bradley to win the Tag Team Championship on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later to Cade and Bradley.

====SmackDown! (2002–2004)====
In April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of &quot;Jakked&quot; alongside fellow WCW alumnus Chavo Guerrero Jr. and defeated The Hurricane and Funaki. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on &quot;Jakked&quot; and later &quot;Velocity&quot; until late July 2002, when he was legitimately injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of Tough Enough&quot;, WWE&#x27;s reality television show.

When he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot; under his real name. DeMott made his &quot;SmackDown!&quot; debut on December 5 as a heel, where he defeated Funaki in a squash match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a push that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, Shannon Moore, Chuck Palumbo, Crash Holly, and Rikishi weekly on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to &quot;Velocity&quot; beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a face turn that also saw him tell knock-knock jokes as part of the turn. As the gimmick failed to get over, he remained on &quot;Velocity&quot; while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus Chris Kanyon. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the color commentator for &quot;Velocity&quot;, beginning on the November 1 episode, and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.

====Deep South Wrestling (2004–2008)====
When &quot;Tough Enough 4&quot; wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to &quot;Velocity&quot;. Instead, he became a full-time trainer for WWE and began working in the company&#x27;s Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. DeMott also worked as a booker for DSW, although his direction in the promotion received criticism, most notably by former WWE developmental wrestler Kenny Omega, who soon requested to be released from his developmental contract due to poor treatment. DeMott was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007, with Tom Prichard taking his place as DSW&#x27;s head trainer.

In March 2015, Devon Nicholson described an incident from 2006 that DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE&#x27;s Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident in which Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked stinkfaces to Zack Ryder and Melissa Coates while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) in order to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with because they wanted to skip the session.

===Independent circuit (2007–2011)===
After parting ways with WWE, DeMott competed for several independent promotions, including the Carolina Wrestling Association and the United Wrestling Federation. In addition to wrestling, he also began operating his own wrestling school called New Energy Wrestling School from 2009 to 2010 in McDonough, Georgia, while also running a brief series of wrestling events in Locust Grove, Georgia. Demott wrestled his last match in 2011.

===Return to WWE (2011–2016)===
==== Return as trainer (2011–2016) ====
In 2011, WWE announced that DeMott would return to the company to perform as the head trainer on the revived &quot;Tough Enough&quot; series. Following the conclusion of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, DeMott replaced Tom Prichard as the head trainer for the Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory on June 2, 2012. After FCW was rebranded into NXT, DeMott retained his position as the head trainer, and continued in that role when the WWE Performance Center was opened in 2013. He was featured as a trainer in the &quot;WWE 2K15&quot; video game.

DeMott resigned from WWE on March 6, 2015 following multiple online wrestling news reports of accusations of misconduct and abuse by a dozen-plus former WWE trainees (see below) -- allegations DeMott defiantly denied.

==== Allegations of misconduct and departure (2015) ====
Several former FCW, DSW, and NXT employees previously working within or with the WWE developmental system made public allegations of misconduct by DeMott during his time as trainer, including accusing DeMott of making trainees perform dangerous drills, physically assaulting and bullying trainees, using homophobic and racial slurs amongst other derogatory terms, letting trainees train while naked, and condoning sexual harassment. These allegations were made by Kevin Matthews, Mike Bucci, Ivelisse Vélez, and Devon Nicholson in 2012, Chad Baxter and Chase Donovan in 2013, Curt Hawkins in 2014, as well as several wrestlers including Judas Devlin, Briley Pierce, Brandon Traven, Derrick Bateman, independent wrestler Terra Calaway, and Kenny Omega from late February to March 2015. Devlin and Traven stated they had submitted complaints to WWE management about DeMott in March 2013 when still WWE employees; they publicized those complaints in 2015. WWE released statements regarding some of the claims that came to light in 2013 and 2015, stating it had investigated the matter and had found no wrongdoing. Pierce questioned the thoroughness of WWE&#x27;s investigations, saying WWE did not question him despite Pierce being one of the alleged victims. The allegations caused a strongly negative reaction on social media in March 2015, with the #FireDeMott hashtag trending on Twitter. On March 6, 2015, DeMott publicly denied the allegations on Twitter, but also announced his resignation from WWE &quot;to avoid any embarrassment or damage&quot; to the company.

During a May 2015 podcast with Vince Russo, Vélez asserted that her reporting DeMott&#x27;s alleged misconduct in 2012 to WWE officials was the likely reason WWE released her (i.e., as retribution) shortly thereafter.

<text>Variations on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 35, is a work for piano composed in 1863 by Johannes Brahms, based on the Caprice No. 24 in A minor by Niccolò Paganini.
==Structure==

The work consists of two books. Each book opens with the theme, Paganini&#x27;s Caprice No. 24 in A minor, followed by fourteen variations. The final variation in each section is virtuosic and climactic.

Brahms intended the work to be more than simply a set of theme and variations; each variation also has the characteristic of a study. He published it as Studies for Pianoforte: Variations on a Theme of Paganini. The work was dedicated to the piano virtuoso Carl Tausig.
It is well known for its harmonic depth and extreme physical difficulty. A particular emphasis of the technical challenges lie on hand independence, with the left hand often mirroring the right hand throughout the piece or having its own set of obstacles.

David Dubal describes it as &quot;a legend in the piano literature,&quot; and &quot;fiendish,&quot; &quot;one of the most subtly difficult works in the literature.&quot; Clara Schumann called it &quot;Hexenvariationen&quot; (Witch&#x27;s Variations) because of its difficulty. Dubal quotes critic James Huneker:
“Brahms and Paganini! Was ever so strange a couple in harness? Caliban and Ariel, Jove and Puck. The stolid German, the vibratile Italian! Yet fantasy wins, even if brewed in a homely Teutonic kettle ... These diabolical variations, the last word in the technical literature of the piano, are also vast spiritual problems. To play them requires fingers of steel, a heart of burning lava and the courage of a lion.”

<text>Kenneth Marc Duberstein (April 21, 1944 – March 2, 2022) was an American lobbyist who served as U.S. president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s White House Chief of Staff from 1988 to 1989.

==Early life and education==
Duberstein was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Jewel (Falb), a teacher, and Aaron Duberstein, a fundraiser for the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School and Franklin and Marshall College (A.B. 1965) and American University (M.A. 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989. While in college he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau.

==Political career==
Duberstein began his public service on Capitol Hill as an intern for Senator Jacob K. Javits. His other early government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Gerald Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration.

During Reagan&#x27;s eight years in office, he had two stints in the White House. His first was as Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1981–1983). His major accomplishment of this period was pushing Reagan&#x27;s economic agenda through a Democratic House of Representatives, including the 1982 Tax Bill. Duberstein was described as Reagan&#x27;s invisible link to Congress. He was at the center of the Administrations push for the bill, working on both sides of the political divide. His second stint was also for two years, first as Deputy Chief of Staff and then for the final six months of the Reagan presidency as White House Chief of Staff (1988–1989). Eight days after Reagan was on TV and acknowledged the Iran–Contra affair, Duberstein took over as chief of staff. Around that time, it was revealed that Nancy Reagan had used an astrologer to determine dates for the president&#x27;s public appearances. Reagan&#x27;s presidency had reached a low point; approval rating was at 37%. His promotion was called a wake-up call for a &quot;drowsy White House&quot;. He came to the job with energy, loyalty, hard work and enthusiasm, having earned the nickname Duderdog; and he made sure to call Nancy twice a day. He had Reagan give a mea culpa address to the nation; poll numbers went right up and the presidency had been turned around.

Duberstein is said to have been the first Jewish person to be White House Chief of Staff.

Between his White House appointments, he was vice-president and director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development and was a lobbyist as vice president of Timmons &amp; Company. Prior to 1987, he served on the Commission for the Preservation of America&#x27;s Heritage Abroad, succeeded by Betty Heitman, previously co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.

==Later career==

In January 1989, Duberstein was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by Reagan. He was the chairman of the Ethics Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee and served as vice chairman of the independent Special Bid Oversight Reform Commission for the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also appeared on Bloomberg alongside John Podesta, and had 23 appearances on C-SPAN. Beginning in season five, Duberstein was a consultant for the TV show &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

In 2013, Duberstein was a signatory to an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage in the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case. His position succeeded, as the court would go on to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in California.

===Lobbyist===

Duberstein transitioned from the White House to lobbyist; he was successful, and his insight and advice was sought by leaders of both parties. Duberstein founded The Duberstein Group Inc. in 1987. It is a consulting services company providing corporate consulting and government relations services. Among its client are Amazon, BP and MLB. Duberstein was hired by Russian authorities, via Goldman Sachs, to lobby against the Magnitsky Bill (as known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act), a bill in the U.S. Congress &quot;to impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation&quot;. Duberstein showed discretion and did not discuss his work, leading to an &quot;air of mystery&quot; about him and what he did for his clients.

===Education activities===
In 2020, he established the Public Service Internship Endowment at his alma mater, Franklin and Marshall, assisting F&amp;M students who secure unpaid internships in public service in Washington, D.C. He was on the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees from 1994 to 2010, and then became an emeritus trustee. A space at the Franklin and Marshall Patricia E. Harris Center for Business, Government and Public Policy is named for him, the &quot;Duberstein West Wing&quot;. He spoke at the dedication of the center and led fund raising for the building&#x27;s renovations. At Harvard Kennedy School, he chaired a senior advisory committee and was a “constant and inspiring presence” to students.

===Political adviser===
He was an adviser to former deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage, according to syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who said that Duberstein was a source for David Corn&#x27;s and Michael Isikoff&#x27;s book about the Valerie Plame affair in which Armitage was found to be the one who leaked Plame&#x27;s CIA status to Novak.

Duberstein and Colin Powell became close during his time as chief of staff and Powell&#x27;s position as National Security Advisor in the Reagan White House. When Powell considered a 1996 presidential run, he was advised by Duberstein. Duberstein guided him to &quot;play the press&quot; and win over Republican leaders. Powell ended up not making the run. When Powell&#x27;s reputation was damaged by his role in the 2003 Iraq War, he used Duberstein to act as a consigliere to repair his name.

Duberstein guided Supreme Court justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas through their ritualistic confirmation proceedings. Other high level appointees he advised and guided through confirmation hearings included CIA director Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. His business partner, Michael S. Berman, a Democrat, performed similar tasks for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

===Boards===
Duberstein enjoyed lucrative posts on countless boards of directors, including The Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips, the Fleming Companies, Inc., and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. He was also on the Board of Governors for the American Stock Exchange and NASD, and served on the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae. He served on the advisory board for Washington, DC–based non-profit America Abroad Media.

==Personality==
Duberstein, a &quot;back-slapping Brooklyn native,&quot; was one of the most connected Washington people. &quot;A permanent Washington fixture,&quot; he was a regular at Washington parties and network talk shows. A gregarious and rumpled, wise-cracking ‘people person’ of relentless optimism and energy...the consummate Washington insider and institutionalist, a big man with an easy smile and a generous laugh who could be hard-nosed, loved gossiping with reporters, believed in bipartisanship and offered his advice to anyone who askedespecially those who succeeded him in the chief of staff job. Duberstein noted that as a Brooklynite he always enjoyed working with people. As a &quot;cultivator&quot; of the press he was generally discreet, refusing to be quoted by name, even for articles about himself. He was forever loved by the Washington press for all the leaking he did during the Reagan years; and, &quot;he loved being Ken Duberstein.&quot;

==Political views==
Duberstein was a politically moderate Rockefeller Republican, fiscally conservative and socially moderate. Before John McCain secured the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Duberstein made inquiries about running the transition team; McCain was not interested. He later broke from his party in the election and supported Obama; commenting on the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice-president, he said: “Even at McDonald&#x27;s, you’re interviewed three times before you’re given a job.&quot;

==Personal life, health and death==
Duberstein was married three times, with his first two marriages, to Marjorie Duberstein and Sydney Duberstein, ending in divorce. He had a daughter from the first marriage and three children from the second. He was then married to Jacqueline Fain, a former TV producer, for 18 years until his death. At their 2003 wedding, Supreme Court Justice David Souter was the officiant and Marvin Hamlisch provided the music. He had a history of kidney disease, and in 2014, received a kidney transplant; his son was the donor. After a long illness, Duberstein died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington on March 2, 2022, at the age of 77. The funeral was at Washington Hebrew Congregation

<doc id="556600" wikidata="Q913624" url="?curid=556600" title="Tanimbar Islands">
<text>The Tanimbar Islands, also called Timur Laut, are a group of about 65 islands in the Maluku province of Indonesia. The largest and most central of the islands is Yamdena; others include Selaru to the southwest of Yamdena, Larat and Fordata to the northeast, Maru and Molu to the north, and Seira, Wuliaru, Selu, Wotap and Makasar to the west. The Indonesian phrase &quot;timur laut&quot; means &quot;east of the sea&quot; or &quot;northeast&quot;.

The Tanimbar Islands are administered as the &quot;Tanimbar Islands Regency&quot; (), a regency of Maluku. The Regency covers a land area of 10,102.92 km2, and it had a population of 105,341 at the 2010 census, rising to 123,572 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 130,278. The principal town and administrative centre lies at Saumlaki.

==Geography==
Geographically, the northeast islands are still part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. The Aru Islands and Kai Islands lie to the northeast, and Babar Island and Timor lie to the west. The islands separate the Banda Sea and the Arafura Sea. The total land area of the Islands is 10,102.92 km2 (3,900.76 sq mi).

The largest of the group is Yamdena. Yamdena Island has a range of thickly forested hills along its eastern coast, while its western coast is lower. Saumlaki is the chief town, located on the south end of Yamdena. Other islands include Larat, Selaru, and Wuliaru.

The population was 123,572 at the 2020 census, of whom about 94% are Christian, and the remainder Muslim or other. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 130,278.

The tiny island of Tanimbarkei is not part of Tanimbar, but of the Kai Islands and inhabited by less than 1,000 very traditional people.

The Tanimbar Islands are part of the Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests ecoregion.

==History==
In modern history, the Tanimbar islands (as the Aru Islands) were mentioned in the 16th century maps of Lázaro Luís (1563), Bartolomeu Velho (c. 1560), Sebastião Lopes (1565), in the 1594 map of the East Indies entitled &quot;Insulæ Moluccæ&quot; by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, and in the map of &quot;Nova Guinea&quot; of 1600 (based on Portuguese sources). The Tanimbar Islands were sighted and possibly visited by Portuguese navigators such as Martim Afonso de Melo Jusarte around 1522–1525, who traveled around the archipelagos of Aru (with the reference &quot;Here wintered Martin Afonso de Melo&quot;) and Tanimbar, and possibly Gomes de Sequeira in 1526.

The Tanimbar Islands were part of the Dutch East Indies. During World War II the Dutch sent a detachment of 13 soldiers led by KNIL sergeant Julius Tahija to the town of Saumlaki in the Tanimbar Islands in July 1942. Japanese ships entered the bay at Saumlaki on 30 July and small boats were used to get to the jetty. The Japanese filed in ranks on the jetty and wanted to march in close order into Saumlaki. The garrison opened fire at close range with their two light machine guns. The Japanese retreated to their boats leaving several dead on the jetty. Subsequent enemy landings, however, were made elsewhere while the Japanese ships opened fire on the defenders’ position. Six of the Dutch soldiers were killed and the survivors were driven into the bush. On 31 July, a vessel carrying an Australian Army contingent arrived at the jetty at Saumlaki, unaware that the town had fallen to the Japanese. The vessel was fired on from the shore, and the commander of the landing party was killed. The Australians retreated to Darwin. Afterwards, the members of the Dutch garrison came under naval gunfire from the Japanese; this inflicted some casualties, and was followed by attacks by Japanese infantry on a wider front. Seven surviving members of the garrison then boarded a sailing ship and escaped to Australia.

==Economy==
Important products are copra, tortoiseshell, and &quot;trepang&quot; (an edible sea cucumber). Recently, the Japanese oil and gas corporation Inpex intended to develop the Masela Block Project with billions of tonnes of natural gas produced. Offshore facilities will be located on the Tanimbar Island.

<text>Saeb Muhammad Salih Erekat ( &quot;Ṣāʼib ʻUrayqāt&quot;; also &quot;ʻRēqāt, Erikat, Erakat, Arekat&quot;; 28 April 195510 November 2020) was a Palestinian politician and diplomat who was the secretary general of the executive committee of the PLO from 2015 until his death in 2020. He served as chief of the PLO Steering and Monitoring Committee until 12 February 2011. He participated in early negotiations with Israel and remained chief negotiator from 1995 until May 2003, when he resigned in protest from the Palestinian government. He reconciled with the party and was reappointed to the post in September 2003.

==Personal life and education==
Erekat was born in Abu Dis. He was a member of the Palestinian branch of the Erekat family, itself a branch of the Howeitat tribal confederation. Erekat was one of seven children, with his brothers and sisters living outside of Israel or the Palestinian territories. He was 12 years old when the Israelis occupied the West Bank, and was detained by them a year later for writing anti-occupation graffiti, posting fliers and throwing stones.

In 1972, Erekat moved to San Francisco, California, to attend college. He spent two years at City College of San Francisco, a two-year community college. He then transferred to San Francisco State University. There, Erekat received a BA in international relations (in 1977) and an MA in political science (in 1979). He completed his PhD in peace and conflict studies at the University of Bradford in England (in 1983).

Erekat was married to Neameh, and was the father of twin daughters Dalal and Salam; and two sons, Ali and Muhammad.

==Career==
=== Academia ===
After gaining his doctorate in England, Erekat moved to the West Bank town of Nablus to lecture in political science at An-Najah National University.

=== Al-Quds editor ===
He served for 12 years on the editorial board of the locally widely circulated Palestinian newspaper, &quot;Al-Quds&quot;.

===Politics===
In 1991, Erekat was deputy head of the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Conference and the subsequent follow-up talks in Washington D.C. between 1992 and 1993. In 1994, he was appointed the Minister for Local Government for the Palestinian National Authority and also the Chairman of the Palestinian negotiation delegation. In 1995, Erekat served as Chief Negotiator for the Palestinians during the Oslo period. He was then elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996, representing Jericho. As a politician, Erekat was considered to be a Yasser Arafat loyalist, including the Camp David meetings in 2000 and the negotiations at Taba in 2001. Erekat was also, along with Arafat and Faisal Husseini, one of the three high-ranking Palestinians who asked Ariel Sharon not to visit Al-Aqsa in September 2000, an event which was followed by the Second Intifada. He also acted as Arafat&#x27;s English interpreter. When Mahmoud Abbas was nominated to serve as Prime Minister of the Palestinian Legislative Council in early 2003, Erekat was slated to be Minister of Negotiations in the new cabinet, but he soon resigned after he was excluded from a delegation to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. This was interpreted as part of an internal Palestinian power struggle between Abbas and Arafat. Erekat was later reappointed to his post and participated in the 2007 Annapolis Conference, where he took over from Ahmed Qurei during an impasse and helped hammer out a joint declaration.

He resigned from his post as chief negotiator on 12 February 2011 citing the release of the Palestine Papers. In July 2013, however, he was still holding the function. In 2015, he became the secretary-general of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He later promoted a plan for the basis for new talks with international diplomats including Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump&#x27;s son-in-law and special adviser.

===Legacy===
Erekat was one of the more prominent Palestinian spokespeople in the Western media. He wrote extensively in the media about Palestinian statehood, and was a vocal critic of the Trump administration&#x27;s peace plan.

Erekat at one time maintained good relations with his counterpart negotiators, in which Israeli justice minister Tsipi Livni mentioned that her talks with Erekat were always honest, and there was mutual respect despite frequent disagreements. In addition, Erekat took his American counterpart, Martin Indyk, on a tour of Hisham&#x27;s Palace near Jericho.

==Health issues and death==
On 8 May 2012, Erekat was hospitalized in Ramallah after suffering a heart attack.
On 12 October 2017, he had a lung transplant at Inova Fairfax Hospital in northern Virginia, United States.
Erekat, who was suffering from pulmonary fibrosis, tested positive for COVID-19 on 9 October 2020. On 18 October, he was sent to the Israeli Hadassah Ein Karem hospital in Jerusalem in critical condition. On 21 October, his daughter said on Twitter that he underwent a bronchoscopy to examine the condition of his respiratory system. Erekat died of complications from COVID-19 on 10 November 2020, at the age of 65. He was interred in the cemetery in Jericho.

<doc id="556611" wikidata="Q672908" url="?curid=556611" title="Sleeping with Ghosts">
<text>Sleeping with Ghosts is the fourth studio album by British alternative rock band Placebo. It was recorded from late 2002 to early 2003 and released on 1 April 2003 by record labels Virgin and Hut.

&quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart, and received a generally favourable reaction from music critics.

== Content ==

Frontman Brian Molko, who is known to be a fan of the band Sonic Youth, references lyrics from their album &quot;Sister&quot; on &quot;Plasticine&quot; (&quot;Beauty lies inside the eye of another youthful dream&quot; directly references &quot;Beauty lies in the eyes of another&#x27;s dream&quot; from Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Beauty Lies in the Eye&quot;).

The album has several songs based on a theme of relationships, such as relationships that end badly (&quot;The Bitter End&quot;), power struggles in relationships (&quot;Special Needs&quot;) or the idea that some are meant to be eternal soulmates (the title track). Brian Molko told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine: &quot;I&#x27;m looking back to what&#x27;s happened in my past emotional decade, trying to understand it. Trying to exorcise the ghosts and the demons of relationships past. It&#x27;s the old cliché of it being therapeutic but it does work for me in that way.&quot;

Another interview has Molko explaining:

The album title&#x27;s about carrying the ghosts of your relationships with you, to the point where sometimes a smell or a situation or an item of clothing they bought brings a person back. For me it&#x27;s about the relationship that you have with your memories. They inhabit your dreams sometimes. There can be a lot in the future that&#x27;s gonna remind you of the ghost of relationships past. So I see the album as a collection of short stories about a handful of relationships. Most of them mine. In a way writing the songs helps me to get a lot of the nasty feelings off my chest and put them in a box, and therefore have a bit more of an objective discourse with those emotions because you&#x27;ve done something positive with them, you&#x27;ve rid yourself of them.

== Release ==

&quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; was released on 1 April 2003. The CD came with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. It reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart.

A Special Edition version of the album was released on 22 September 2003 worldwide, featuring a diverse selection of cover versions that the band had recorded in previous years. This was re-released as a download-only album in 2007 under the name &quot;Covers&quot;. This is their last album released under Hut.

== Reception ==
&quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; received &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot; from critics, and holds an approval rating of 64 out of 100 on Metacritic.

Michael Idov of Pitchfork wrote &quot;No peaks, no gorges, just a steady oscillation between adequate and inspired. &quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; is a remarkably level collection of guitar pop, simultaneously less glammy and less pungent than Placebo&#x27;s earlier stuff.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote &quot;There&#x27;s some terrific and accessible stuff here [...] but the result is still an album that retreads old Placebo themes.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine called it &quot;spikily brilliant&quot;.

<text>Colonel Samuel Richard Tickell (19 August 1811 – 20 April 1875) was an English soldier, artist, linguist and ornithologist in India and Burma.

==Biography==
Tickell was born at Cuttack in India to Captain Samuel Tickell (of the 8th regiment of the Bengal Native Infantry) and Mary née Morris. His grandfather was Richard Tickell the English playwright and satirist. Lieutenant General Richard Tickell was a first cousin once removed.

Samuel Tickell was educated in England with a training at Addiscombe from 1827 to 1829, returning at age nineteen to join the Bengal Native Infantry in 1829. He served in the 31st Bengal Native Infantry during the Kol campaign (1832–33). He was made commander of Brian Hodgson&#x27;s military escort to Kathmandu from 1834. He returned to Bengal in 1843, and after his promotion to captain in 1847 he was moved to Arakan, lower Burma. He applied to serve as revenue surveyor in Bhagalpur in 1848 but found himself without experience and let his assistants work on surveys while he carried out administrative duties. The survey work was ridden with errors and in 1849 he handed over charge and returned to Arakan.

During his time in India, Tickell made important contributions to the country&#x27;s ornithology and mammalology, with field observations and the collections of specimens. He contributed to volume 17 of the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot;. Volume 18 included a report by Tickell from Burma. He wrote under the pen-name of &quot;Ornithognomon&quot; and &quot;Old Log&quot;. Hume noted that many of the notes written as &quot;Ornithognomon&quot; in the &quot;Field&quot; were based on observations of another amateur ornithologist, Frederic Wilson. Tickell married Maria Georgiana, daughter of J.W. Templer at Bankura on 11 July 1844.

Tickell retired in 1865 and lived for a period in France before settling in the Channel Islands. In 1870, while fishing on the coast of Brittany, he suffered an eye inflammation which eventually made him blind. Tickell had been working on a seven-volume work entitled &quot;Illustrations of Indian Ornithology&quot;, but his deteriorating eyesight forced him to abandon it. Before his death he donated the unfinished work to the Zoological Society of London. These works were bound into fourteen volumes. These included one on &quot;the fishes collected in the seas and freshwaters of British Burma from 1851-64&quot; with watercolour illustrations, a field of study which had been examined by very few fish taxonomists, the earliest work being by Francis Day; a volume on mammals (214 pages); a volume on &quot;insects, reptiles, amphibians, arachnids and crustaceans&quot; (256 pages); and the remaining volumes on birds. Of these seven volumes were titled &quot;Indian Ornithology&quot; and included 276 species illustrated of a total of 488 species described. In addition there were two volumes titled &quot;Tickell Aves&quot; with descriptions and watercolour illustrations which were based on two draft volumes of &quot;Tickell Aves MS&quot; I &amp; II. The work showcased his excellent artistic abilities, including paintings of birds in natural habitats as well as ink vignettes showing scenes from Indian life.

Tickell died in Cheltenham.

A number of birds were named after Tickell, including:

*Tickell&#x27;s flowerpecker, &quot;Dicaeum erythrorhynchos&quot;
*Tickell&#x27;s leaf warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus affinis&quot;
*Tickell&#x27;s thrush, &quot;Turdus unicolor&quot;
*Tickell&#x27;s brown hornbill, &quot;Anorrhinus tickelli&quot;;

and possibly one species after his wife, given the feminine or plural form (i.e. honouring the Tickell couple), though this isn&#x27;t made clear in the original description:
*Tickell&#x27;s blue flycatcher, &quot;Cyornis tickelliae&quot;.

Tickell was also interested in linguistics and wrote a series of articles on the grammatical structure of the Ho language.

<doc id="556620" wikidata="Q7437975" url="?curid=556620" title="Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party">
<text>The Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party (SSCUP), later the All-Scotland Pensioners Party from March 2011, was a minor Scottish political party. It was formed on 3 February 2003, in time to contest that year&#x27;s elections to the Scottish Parliament. The leading figure in its formation and its first leader was John Swinburne, previously a director of Motherwell Football Club. Swinburne was inspired to form the party after reading the UK government&#x27;s plans for pensions in December 2002: he felt it was unfair that people might have to work longer in the future and consequently have less time to enjoy their retirement.

To fight elections, the SSCUP registered with the UK Electoral Commission and under the provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the party also registered alternative names for use on ballot papers, including &quot;Scottish Senior Citizens and Pensioners&quot;, and &quot;Alliance of Scots Greys&quot;.

On the same day the SSCUP was launched, the Scottish Pensioners Party was formed in Fife. The SSCUP made an electoral pact with this party for the Scottish Parliamentary elections, whereby they did not stand candidates against each other. Former Scottish international footballers Billy McNeill, who played for Celtic and Eric Caldow, who played for Rangers, both stood for the SSCUP in these elections.

John Swinburne was the SSCUP&#x27;s sole representative in the Scottish Parliament, representing Central Scotland from 2003 until 2007.

==Party aims and elections==
The party listed nine key aims on its website:
# An index-linked basic weekly state pension of £160 for all senior citizens
# Remove all senior citizens from poverty in Scotland
# Abolition of means-testing for senior citizens
# Replace council tax with a fairer system based on ability to pay
# Local authorities to set up more residential homes for senior citizens
# Free nationwide travel for all senior citizens - outside peak travelling times
# 50% reduction in television licences for senior citizens aged 60 to 75
# 50% reduction in vehicle excise duty for all senior citizens
# Establish a Scottish Lottery, with all profits going back into the community

In the 2007 Scottish Election the SSCUP lost its only seat in Holyrood, despite polling as the sixth best party and a slight increase in its vote share. However, that was possibly due to the party putting up more candidates. In 2011 their vote decreased, but they still remained the sixth placed party.

The party was de-registered in 2015.

<text>Black Isle Studios is a division of the developer and publisher Interplay Entertainment formed in 1996 that develops role-playing video games. It has published several games from other developers.

Black Isle is based in Irvine, California. The idea for the division&#x27;s name came from the Black Isle in Scotland – founder Feargus Urquhart&#x27;s ancestral country. Black Isle Studios is most famous for its work on the &quot;Fallout&quot; series as well as the critically acclaimed &quot;&quot;. They achieved success with the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series of role-playing video games, though they only published the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series. In 1999, IGN&#x27;s RPG Vault gave it the award for a Developer of the Year. The company was closed in late 2003 due to Interplay&#x27;s financial troubles.

Interplay briefly revived the Black Isle name in August 2012 with the intention of producing new role-playing games under that label. Black Isle Studios released &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; remastered in May 2021.

==History==

Created in 1996 by Feargus Urquhart, the studio was named Black Isle after Urquhart&#x27;s homeland. The studio, although credited for the creation of &quot;Fallout&quot; was, in fact, not responsible for the game. Rather a key portion of the original studio came from the team that made &quot;Fallout&quot;. When developing &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, several employees left Interplay to form Troika Games after they &quot;were unable to come to an agreement with Interplay as to how [their] next team should be structured.&quot; The remaining team would go on to release such critically acclaimed games as &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;. The studio also released critically acclaimed &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; developed by BioWare.

In the years leading to the closure of Black Isle, Interplay&#x27;s financial difficulties would worsen, leading for the team to cancel anticipated games as &quot;Black Isle&#x27;s Torn&quot; and &quot;Stonekeep 2: Godmaker&quot;, releasing only &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;, publishing &quot;&quot; and developing &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot;. On December 8, 2003, in the midst of serious financial difficulties, Interplay laid off the entire Black Isle Studios staff, which also resulted in the cancellation of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III: The Black Hound&quot;, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance III&quot; and the original &quot;Fallout 3&quot;.

In 2012, Interplay had been trying for several years to get the troubled &quot;Project V13&quot; off the ground. Originally conceived as a massively multiplayer online game set in the world of &quot;Fallout&quot;, the project suffered a significant setback when Interplay lost all rights to use the Fallout brand. As part of their efforts to restart the project anew, Interplay revived Black Isle Studios with two of its original team members and began a crowdfunding campaign to fund a prototype in 2012. The campaign did not raise sufficient funds to develop a playable prototype, and communications from Interplay and Black Isle about the project had ceased completely by early 2014.

<text>was a Japanese samurai and the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late shogunate period. He was one of the best swordsmen of the Shinsengumi.

==Background==
He was born in 1842 or 1844 from a samurai family in the Shirakawa Domain&#x27;s Edo mansion. His great-grandfather was Okita Kan&#x27;emon (d. 1819) and his grandfather was Okita Sanshiro (d. 1833.) His father, Okita Katsujiro, died in 1845; he had two older sisters, Okita Mitsu (1833–1907) and Okita Kin (1836–1908). In 1846, in order to marry the adopted son of the Okita family, Okita Rintarō (1826–1883), his oldest sister Okita Mitsu became an adopted daughter of Kondo Shusuke in name. Kondo Shusuke was the third master of the &quot;Tennen Rishin-ryū&quot; and Okita started training at the &quot;Shieikan&quot; with him around the age of nine. By that time, Kondo Shusuke had already adopted Shimazaki Katsuta (the later Kondō Isami), but Hijikata Toshizō had not yet enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryū school. Okita proved to be a prodigy; he mastered all the techniques and attained the &quot;Menkyo Kaiden&quot; scroll (&quot;license of total transmission&quot;) in the &quot;ryū&quot; at the age of eighteen or so.

In 1861, Okita became Head Coach (&quot;Jukutou&quot;) at the Shieikan. Even though he was often commented to be honest, polite, and good-natured by those around him, he was also known to be a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students.

==Shinsengumi period==
Okita changed his name to Okita Sōji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi some time before his departure with the Rōshigumi to Kyoto on March 26, 1863. However, the Rōshigumi was disbanded upon their arrival there on April 10, 1863, while the rest returned to Edo. Okita and several other founding members remained behind in Mibu to form the Mibu Rōshigumi, which would later be renamed as the Shinsengumi on August 18, 1863. Okita was the second youngest among the Shieikan members, most likely with Tōdō Heisuke being the youngest. His brother-in-law Okita Rintarō, also a practitioner of the Tennen Rishin-ryū, became a commander of the &quot;Shinchōgumi&quot; (the Shinsengumi&#x27;s brother league in Edo.)

Okita Sōji soon became a &quot;Fukuchō Jokin&quot; (vice-commander&#x27;s assistant) of the Shinsengumi. He was one of the members involved in the Serizawa Kamo (one of the original commanders of the Shinsengumi) and the Uchiyama Hikojiro assassinations in 1863.

Mediocre with the shinai, a master of the bokken/bokutou and bo staff, a fascinating trendsetter of the katana, his signature technique was named the &quot;Hyakkidou-ri&quot; (which roughly translates as &quot;no light blade&quot; or &quot;unenlightened blade&quot;) or &quot;Sandanzuki&quot; (which translates as &quot;Three Piece Thrust&quot;), a technique that could attack one&#x27;s neck, left shoulder, and right shoulder with one strike. (The Mumyo-ken supposedly could hit all three points simultaneously, but this is an embellishment.) The Mumyo-ken was his own invention and may have been derived from an invention of Hijikata&#x27;s, the Hirazuki.

It is a popular conception by the public that his tuberculosis was first discovered when he fainted during the Ikedaya incident, mostly due to the depiction appearing in a famous work chronicling the Shinsengumi as well as a number of period dramas based upon it. Some sources on the other hand say that he contracted the disease after that. Both theories are fairly reasonable, as tuberculosis can kill quickly (in weeks), or very slowly (many years). However, one should note that people rarely survived the disease longer than a year once it progressed to the point that they would collapse, and Okita did not die until four years after the affair. Some researchers now believe he instead collapsed due to some other ailment, such as anemia or heat stroke. While many of Shinsengumi fans believe that Yoshida Toshimaro was killed by Okita during the Ikedaya Affair (based on Shimosawa Kan and Shiba Ryōtarō&#x27;s fiction), it is a historical inaccuracy.

Based on Shiba Ryoutarou&#x27;s fiction, many also believe that Okita and Hijikata were like brothers. In history, Yamanami Keisuke was the vice-commander Okita shared a brotherly relationship with. Yamanami&#x27;s &quot;seppuku&quot; (with Okita as his second) in 1865 was an extremely painful incident in Okita&#x27;s short life. There is no record showing that Hijikata and Okita were close; it is debatable whether Okita even got along with Hijikata.

In 1865, Okita became the captain of the first unit of the Shinsengumi and also served as a kenjutsu instructor; later that year, he was appointed by Kondo Isami to be the fifth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryu after him.

Although highly unlikely, it was rumored that he wielded a famous katana called &quot;Kiku-ichimonji&quot;. However, he surely owned a set of &quot;Kaga Kiyomitsu&quot; (a katana and a wakizashi) and his so-called &quot;Kikuichimonji Norimune&quot; was likely a &quot;Yamashiro Kunikiyo&quot; instead.

==Death==
During the Boshin War, after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in the first month of the year Keiō-4, Okita went into Matsumoto Ryōjun&#x27;s hospital in Edo. He then moved to a guesthouse with Okita Rintarou, Okita Mitsu, and their children. When the shogunate forces (including the Shinsengumi and the Shinchōgumi) retreated to the Tōhoku region, Okita remained in Edo alone. He died from tuberculosis on July 19 (the 30th day of the fifth month, by the lunar calendar), 1868. Later that night, he was buried at Senshō-ji Temple in Azabu, Edo, under his birth name (with Okita Sōji listed in the death records). The claim that Okita died when he was 25 is based on the theory that he was born in 1844 and therefore was 25 by East Asian age reckoning when he died in 1868.

The Senshō-ji Temple cemetery had been open to the public for years until the release of NHK&#x27;s Taiga drama, &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;, in 2004, which generated newfound interest in the Shinsengumi and Okita. Many visitors flocked to the temple to see his grave, resulting in the temple&#x27;s cemetery becoming restricted to the public, except for one day each year in June.

==Name==
&quot;Okita&quot; (沖田) was his family name; &quot;Sōji&quot; (総司) was his given name; &quot;Fujiwara&quot; (藤原) was his family clan (the surname of his ancestors); &quot;Kaneyoshi&quot; (房良) was his , a formal given name (like a middle name for gentlemen equivalent). It is unclear whether Okita changed his name to &quot;Okita Sōji Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot; in 1863 or in 1862 (or less likely, in 1861.) There is a theory that he changed his name to Sōji because some people around him called him &quot;Sō-Ji&quot; (short for Sōjirō.) Other than his full name, he could be referred as &quot;Okita Sōji&quot; or &quot;Okita Sōji Kaneyoshi&quot;. In writing, he was sometimes referred as &quot;Fujiwara no Kaneyoshi&quot; (formal name used in writing) or &quot;Okita Kaneyoshi&quot; (like the &quot;initials&quot; for his full name.)


==In popular culture==
Like the other members of the Shinsengumi, fictionalized accounts of Okita&#x27;s life and actions appear in novels, period dramas and anime/manga series. Although his given name is sometimes pronounced as &quot;Soushi&quot; in the fictional world, it is actually &quot;Sōji&quot;.

*In the 2004 Japanese drama &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;, Okita was played by Tatsuya Fujiwara.
*Okita is a main character in the anime/manga &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;, which takes more liberties with history.
*He is the protagonist of the 2004 manga oneshot &quot;Because Goodbyes are Coming Soon&quot; by Makoto Yukimura.
*Okita is mentioned in the anime and manga series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, which takes place during and after the Meiji Revolution in Japan. He makes a major appearance in the OVA and is briefly shown during the Kyoto Arc (before the character based on the portrayal of Okita Sōji in the novel &quot;Shinsengumi Keppūroku&quot;, Seta Sōjirō, makes his appearance); in the manga, Okita is also shown during the Jinchū Arc. However, some of the translations of the English dub are incorrect. In the OVA English dub, Okita is portrayed as a subordinate of Saito Hajime, when in fact he was his equal or superior in rank and kenjutsu skills. At the end of the OVA when he finally confronts Kenshin, another Shinsengumi member called Okita a lieutenant in the English dubbed track, when in fact he was the captain of the first troop. In the Japanese dub, the unknown Shinsengumi member correctly refers to him as: 組長 Kumichô. During his brief appearance in the anime, he is shown coughing and having pain in his chest, a reference to his death by tuberculosis.
*In the anime series, &quot;Intrigue in the Bakumatsu - Irohanihoheto&quot;, Okita is depicted as an old acquaintance of the protagonist, Akizuki Yōjirō.
*Okita is also one of the main playable characters in the Xbox video game &quot;Kengo: The Legend of the 9 Samurai&quot;.
*In an episode of the anime &quot;Ghost Sweeper Mikami&quot;, ghost-hunter Mikami Reiko gets inside of a haunted movie about the Bakumatsu and meets Okita, who is depicted as a crazy guy who thinks only of killing people (obvious pun on his usual portrayal, which also is a foil to the show&#x27;s rendition of Hijikata.) In the anime/manga series &quot;Shura no Toki&quot;, Okita&#x27;s (fictional) last battle before succumbing to his sickness is with Mutsu Izumi from the &quot;Mutsu Enmei Ryuu&quot;, an unarmed martial art. Their duel was a request from Okita himself from years before. Okita appears during a flashback in &quot;Kido Shinsengumi: Moeyo Ken&quot; (which features Okita&#x27;s fictional daughter Kaoru as one of the three main characters of the series). He also appears in the short OVA &quot;Hijikata Toshizou: Shiro no Kiseki&quot;, which attempts a proper portrayal of the Shinsengumi.
*Okita is the male protagonist in the manga &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot;, a fictional story about the Shinsengumi during the late Tokugawa shogunate, in which Okita trains a young girl to be one of the Shinsengumi in order to avenge her father and older brother. He is also featured in the manga &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot;.
*He is depicted in the 1999 live-action film &quot;Gohatto&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Taboo&quot;), the 2003 Japanese film &quot;When the Last Sword Is Drawn&quot;, video game series &quot;Shinsengumi Gunrou-den&quot; (as the protagonist), video game series &quot;Fu-un Shinsengumi,&quot; video game series &quot;Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi,&quot; and video game &quot;Chaos Wars.&quot;
*The popular Japanese conception of Okita is that his character and his swordsmanship were of the highest purity. In Shiba Ryotaro&#x27;s novels, he joined the Shinsengumi not because of his political beliefs but rather out of his loyalty for Kondo Isami and his (fictional) friendship with Hijikata Toshizo.
*His anime, manga, and TV depictions tend to be as a handsome young man, sometimes a bishōnen. The Latin American dub of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, even mistook Okita for a woman. In fact, in a 1991 movie, &quot;Bakumatsu Jūnjōden&quot; (幕末純情伝), he is portrayed as a boyish woman. In a 2003 theatrical production of the same name (which has been renewed every few years), (s)he&#x27;s been portrayed over the years by actresses such as Ryōko Hirosue, Satomi Ishihara, Mirei Kiritani and Rena Matsui.
*Soushi Yukimi, from the anime series &quot;Soar High! Isami&quot; is inspired and based on Okita Sōji.
*Okita appeared in the anime and manga series &quot;Yaiba&quot; as a fictional grandnephew of the historical Shinsengumi member of the same name. And also in Case Closed as a Kendo Rival of Heiji Hattori.
*Okita Sougo, from the anime/manga &quot;Gintama&quot;, is loosely based on Okita Sōji.
*Okita is loosely portrayed in the Japanese otome game, &quot;Hakuouki&quot; (薄桜鬼), along with other Shinsengumi members. They are samurais who develop vampiristic qualities as the game progresses. He is also portrayed in the anime adaptation of the game. In this franchise, Okita is a skilled warrior who develops a case of tuberculosis. He drinks the ochimizu, a potion which transforms him into a rasetsu.
*In the Japanese video game &quot;Sengoku Rance&quot; by Alicesoft, a female version of Okita plays a minor role, Okita Nozomi. Okita Nozomi can be recruited from the Shinsengumi in the game as a commander, and is one of the best swordsmen in the game. She is also seen constantly coughing up blood and is later diagnosed with the &quot;Cough-Cough Disease&quot;.
*The digital comic &quot;Okita and the Cat&quot; deals with the anecdotal last days of Okita Sōji. The former swordsman is depicted as a pleasant raconteur despite his disease, though he&#x27;s secretly frustrated at his inability to stand by his comrades. The comic, by Josh Hechinger and mpMann, was released for Apple mobile devices in August 2010 through Arrow Publications.
*In the 2012 video game and anime &quot;Inazuma Eleven GO 2: Chrono Stone&quot;, Okita appears during the late stages of his life, but is shown playing soccer against Sakamoto Ryōma, and fuses with Tsurugi Kyōsuke to create &quot;a speedy striker as quick as lightning, who cuts up the field like a lightning bolt&quot;.
*Okita appears in the volume 13 of &quot;High School DxD&quot; as a member of the Lucifer group, as the Devil Knight of Sirzechs Lucifer, stated to have been reincarnated as a Devil after his historical death from tubercluosis as a human.
*In the gag manga &quot;Fate/KOHA-ACE&quot;, a spin-off of the &quot;Fate&quot; franchise created by Kinoko Nasu, the Saber-class servant, dubbed &quot;Sakura Saber,&quot; is the spirit of Okita Souji. In this fictional incarnation, Okita is a woman. Sakura Saber also appears as a Servant in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, and gets her own spinoff &quot;Fate/Type Redline&quot;.
*In the eroge franchise &quot;ChuSinGura 46+1&quot; which depicts male historical figures as young girls, Okita is a cyan-haired, amber-eyed girl.
*In the anime &quot;Touken Ranbu&quot;, Okita is frequently shown in Yamatonokami Yasusada&#x27;s flashbacks or dreams to be consumed by his disease during a raid relating to the Ikeda Inn Incident. Okita is shown to have long, black hair and blue eyes.
*In the otome game &quot;Destined to Love&quot;, Okita is shown as a character with brown hair and brown eyes, and barely take cares of himself. He has his own route in the game.
*Another otome game &quot;©2015 Spaceout Inc.&quot; features Isami Kondo, Hijikata Toshizo and Soji Okita as suitors for main character. It also has other side characters like Matsumoto Ryojun, Ryoma Sakamoto and Saito Hajime.
*In otome game Era of Samurai: Code of Love which developed by Voltage inc, Okita Soji along with Hijikata Toshizo, Harada Sanosuke, Saito Hajime, Kondo Isami and Shinsaku Takasugi were featured as a love interest for main character.
*In the 2014 spin-off game from the &quot;Yakuza&quot; series, Ryu Ga Gotoku Ishin!, Okita Soji is visually based on series regular Goro Majima and the two share a voice as well. The game takes place in the Bakumatsu period and has the protagonist, as Sakamoto Ryouma, joining the Shinsengumi, of which Okita is a division captain.
*In the anime &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; (2018) and its sequel, &quot;Bakumatsu Crisis&quot; (2019), Okita Soji plays a key antagonist role as a member of the Shinsengumi under the command of Mugensai. Other key members of the Shinsengumi such as Isami Kondo, Yamazaki Susumu and Hijikata Toshizo are also featured, in addition to Takasugi Shinsaku.
*In the manga &quot;Shuumatsu no Valkyrie&quot;, Okita Soji is chosen to represent Humanity in a tournament against the gods of multiple pantheons to determine the fate of Humanity. It is shown that within the show, Okita&#x27;s fighting style is on the basis of agility.
*The name of the main character Tokita Sōjin from the visual novel video game &quot;Sen no Hatou, Tsukisome no Kouki&quot; (2017) is a tribute to Okita Soji.
*He is portrayed by Nijiro Murakami in the 2021 movie Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning

<doc id="556628" wikidata="Q621820" url="?curid=556628" title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive">
<text>The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) is a European Community Directive, numbered 2012/19/EU, concerned with waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Together with the RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU, it became European Law in February 2003. The WEEE Directive set collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods, with a minimum rate of per head of population &quot;per annum&quot; recovered for recycling by 2009. The RoHS Directive set restrictions upon European manufacturers as to the material content of new electronic equipment placed on the market.

The symbol adopted by the European Council to represent waste electrical and electronic equipment comprises a crossed-out wheelie bin with or without a single black line underneath the symbol. The black line indicates that goods have been placed on the market after 2005, when the Directive came into force. Goods without the black line were manufactured between 2002 and 2005. In such instances, these are treated as &quot;historic WEEE&quot; and fall outside reimbursement via producer compliance schemes.

The origins of the black line (or bar) stem from Directive 2012/19/EU referencing European standard EN 50419. This standard gives two options for marking of equipment manufactured after 13 August 2005, namely 1) adding the date of manufacture to the label or 2) applying the line/bar underneath the bin logo.

==Directive revisions==

The directive has undergone a number of minor revisions since its inception in 2002 (Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003). These include updates in 2006 and 2009.

After nine years the Directive was seen as failing to achieve some of its goals, hence the legislation had been amended again. On 20 December 2011 the European Parliament and the European Council agreed on amendments to the Directive, subject to a second-reading vote, which was taken on 19 January 2012.

The changes affect the method for calculating collection rates, which were previously per inhabitant per year. To provide a transitional period of seven years to introduce the revised method of calculation, the present method is retained for the first four years from the time the amended Directive comes into force. For the next three years, commencing with the fifth year after the amendment, the calculation of collection rates will be revised to 45% of the weight of E&amp;E products entering the market. Once this seven years transitional period is over, EU member states will individually select the actual collection options they wish to use.

The overall aim was for the EU to recycle at least 85% of electrical and electronics waste equipment by 2016.

==Member state implementation==
The directive imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the manufacturers or distributors of such equipment. It requires that those companies establish an infrastructure for collecting WEEE, in such a way that &quot;Users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE at least free of charge&quot;. The directive saw the formation of national &quot;producer compliance schemes&quot;, into which manufacturers and distributors paid an annual fee for the collection and recycling of associated waste electronics from household waste recycling centres.

==Amending acts and secondary legislation==
Directive 2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has replaced Directive 2002/96/EC. Several amending acts and secondary legislation have been established to support and enhance the implementation of this directive.

One such act is Commission Decision 2005/369/EC of 3 May 2005, which laid down rules for monitoring the compliance of Member States and established data formats for the purposes of Directive 2002/96/EC on WEEE. Additionally, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/699 of 18 April 2017 established a common methodology for calculating the weight of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market in each Member State and for calculating the quantity of WEEE generated by weight in each Member State. Further, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2193 of 17 December 2019 set forth rules for the calculation, verification, and reporting of data, along with establishing data formats for the purposes of Directive 2012/19/EU on WEEE.

==Categorisations of WEEE==
Annex II of Directive 2012/19/EU includes an indicative list of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) that falls under the categories outlined in Annex I. From the reference year 2019 onwards, all EEE must be classified within six product categories specified in Annex III. These categories are:

#Temperature exchange equipment
#Screens, monitors, and equipment containing screens with a surface greater than 100 cm2
#Lamps
#Large equipment (any external dimension more than 50 cm), which includes but is not limited to household appliances, IT and telecommunication equipment, consumer equipment, luminaires, equipment for reproducing sound or images, musical equipment, electrical and electronic tools, toys, leisure and sports equipment, medical devices, monitoring and control instruments, automatic dispensers, and equipment for the generation of electric currents. This category excludes equipment included in categories 1 to 3.
#Small equipment (no external dimension more than 50 cm), which includes but is not limited to household appliances, consumer equipment, luminaires, equipment for reproducing sound or images, musical equipment, electrical and electronic tools, toys, leisure and sports equipment, medical devices, monitoring and control instruments, automatic dispensers, and equipment for the generation of electric currents. This category excludes equipment included in categories 1 to 3 and 6.
#Small IT and telecommunication equipment (no external dimension more than 50 cm).

==UK implementation==
Prior to the implementation of the WEEE directive in the UK, waste electronic and electrical equipment was disposed of in the household (municipal) waste stream. Post the introduction of the Hazardous Waste Regulations, exclusions apply to electrical and electronic equipment that are deemed hazardous. Hazardous wastes are derived (issued with a universal EU descriptor) from the European Waste Catalogue (known in the UK as the List of Wastes), which denotes wastes with a six digit number in three sets of two. Hazardous wastes are denoted with an asterisk at the end of the number. Hazardous electronic wastes comprise:

* Uninterruptible power supplies, lead–acid batteries
* Cathode-ray tubes (televisions, computer monitors)
* Fluorescent tubes, backlights to laptop screens, thin-film transistors
* Electrical/electronic equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)
* Fridges and freezers, due to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), an ozone-depleting substance. As of 2012 revisions to the regulations, all refrigerants are considered Hazardous.

WEEE that is delivered to household waste recycling centres (HWRC), also known as designated collection facilities (DCFs), is collected by or delivered to approved authorised treatment facilities (AATFs). The waste electrical and electronic equipment is then weighed and categorised in accordance with the directive.

Post re-processing (recycling), total volumes of each category are reported to the producer compliance scheme and the reprocessor is reimbursed accordingly. Totals of obligated WEEE for all AATFs are collated by the environment agency on a quarterly basis and reported to the EU.

Historically, there were problems with the implementation of the producer compliance schemes due to a &quot;double counting&quot; and reporting of reprocessed WEEE to producer compliance schemes. This arose where obligated WEEE was partially treated by the first AATF to receive the waste, prior to it being passed onto a second AATF for further treatment. Both the first and second AATF would then claim against the same waste electronics, resulting in a &quot;net debt&quot; against the wastes being treated.

Additional legislation that applies is:
* The Environmental Protection (Duty of Care) Regulations 1991
* Hazardous Waste Regulations (England &amp; Wales) 2005
* Waste Framework Directive, or Directive 2008/98/EC

The management of WEEE is applied via the waste hierarchy, with particular emphasis upon reduction of waste arising, re-use of equipment and recycling (recovery) of materials: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. In January 2012, proposals were debated by the European Parliament to recast the WEEE Directive. The proposals included increasing recycling rates. Having been adopted by member states, the re-drafted directive now requires higher recovery rates of &quot;per capita&quot; &quot;per annum&quot; as opposed to previous figures of &quot;per capita&quot;.

===Public awareness===

In April 2005 the Royal Society of Arts in the UK (in conjunction with Canon) unveiled a 7 m tall sculpture titled &quot;WEEE Man&quot; on London&#x27;s South Bank, made from 3.3 tonnes of electrical goods—the average amount of electrical waste one UK individual creates in a lifetime. It was designed by Paul Bonomini and fabricated by Stage One Creative Services. The giant figure was subsequently moved to the Eden Project in Cornwall as part of a UK tour.

<doc id="556630" wikidata="Q270892" url="?curid=556630" title="Symphony No. 8 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 8 in C minor, Op. 65, by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in the summer of 1943, and first performed on 4 November of that year by the USSR Symphony Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky, to whom the work is dedicated. It briefly was nicknamed the &quot;Stalingrad Symphony&quot; following the first performance outside the Soviet Union in 1944.

Music critics have ranked it among the composer&#x27;s finest scores. David Haas has argued that the work falls within the tradition of other C minor &quot;tragedy to triumph&quot; symphonies, such as Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth, Brahms&#x27; First, Bruckner&#x27;s Eighth, and Mahler&#x27;s Second, although there is considerable disagreement over the level of optimism present in the final pages. Shostakovich&#x27;s friend Isaac Glikman called this symphony &quot;his most tragic work&quot;. The work, like many of his symphonies, breaks some of the standard conventions of symphonic form and structure. Shostakovich clearly references themes, rhythms and harmonies from his previous symphonies, most notably Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 7.

==Movements==
The work consists of five movements:

The first movement, which runs roughly half an hour, is by far the longest. It opens with a dramatic motif played fortissimo in octaves, characterised by David Haas in his study as a &quot;fate&quot; motif:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \new Staff \with { midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; }
 \relative c&quot; {
 \tempo &quot;Adagio&quot; 8 = 80
 \key c \major

 g4~ g8.. ges32-.) f2~ |
 f4~ f8. es32 d es2~ |
 es4 f2 ges8. f32 es |
 d8
»
&lt;/score&gt;

However, the motif is immediately replaced by the two subjects of this sonata form movement, both lyrical in character. In the development section, the second subject is transformed before march motifs come to dominate. The recapitulation sees a dissonant version of the fate motif displaced by a cor anglais solo which restates the second subject.

The composer described the short second movement allegretto as &quot;a march with elements of a scherzo&quot;:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \new Staff
 \tempo &quot;Allegretto&quot; 4 = 132

 &lt;es es,&gt;4 &lt;e e,&gt; &lt;f f,&gt;2~ |
 q8
 }
&lt;/score&gt;

The third movement (conventionally described as a toccata) is again short, driven onwards by motor rhythms:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \new Staff \with {midiInstrument = &quot;viola&quot;} {
 \relative c {
 \clef alto
 \tempo &quot;Allegro non troppo&quot; 2 = 152
 \key e \minor
 \time 2/2
 e4^&quot;Va&quot;-\markup{\dynamic f \italic { marcatissimo }} g b g |
 e g b g |
 a b a b |
 g a g a |
 fis g a g |
 fis g a g |
 fis g a b |
 c d c d | b
 }
»&lt;/score&gt;

This movement has been interpreted as a depiction of battle, or (by Kurt Sanderling) as &quot;the crushing of the individual&quot; by the Soviet system. It finally erupts into a &quot;massive climax of self-destruction&quot;, leading to the penultimate movement, a subdued passacaglia. This in turn, as in Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, leads directly into the C major finale. However, in contrast to Beethoven&#x27;s exuberant conclusion, Shostakovich provides a pastoral rondo in which solo woodwinds again dominate. The movement begins with a passage for solo bassoon, and ends quietly with both pizzicato and sustaining strings; for some additional color, a solo flute joins in for the last note of the motive, at the very bottom of its range. The pizzicato material is an inverted version of the symphony&#x27;s opening fate motif, and is connected by Haas to a similar passage for soprano voice in the fifth movement of Mahler&#x27;s Second. Here, however, there is no resurrection: &quot;The hero who announced himself using the voices of cor anglais and bassoon has not clearly triumphed, merely survived&quot;.

The weight of the first and final movements of the symphony is centered on simultaneous crescendos of the snare and bass drums, while trumpets call to the pinnacle which is overlaid by woodwind trills.

A second interval is used as a motif throughout the symphony: C–B–C in the opening motif of the first movement, D–C–D in the theme of the second movement, E–F–E in the third movement (here separated by an octave), and C–D–C in the last movement.

== Instrumentation ==
The symphony is scored for a large orchestra which consists of 4 flutes (3rd and 4th doubling piccolos), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 B-flat clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, tambourine, cymbals, snare drum, triangle, xylophone, tamtam, and strings.

==Reception==
In a letter to Glikman, the composer wrote:

I am sure that it will give rise to valuable critical observations which will both inspire me to future creative work and provide insights enabling me to review that which I have created in the past. Rather than take a step backward I shall thus succeed in taking one forward.
It was indeed not well received, although reviews were tepid rather than scathing. The bleak tone, and in particular the lack of an optimistic conclusion, made it unsuitable as propaganda at home or abroad. Shostakovich&#x27;s friend Ivan Sollertinsky noted that, &quot;the music is significantly tougher and more astringent than the Fifth or the Seventh and for that reason is unlikely to become popular&quot;. The symphony was criticized by Sergei Prokofiev and others at a Composers&#x27; Plenum in March 1944, and after the Zhdanov decree of 1948 it was effectively banned until eight years later. The symphony was rehabilitated in October 1956, in a performance by the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Samuil Samosud.

It was introduced to the western hemisphere during World War II by CBS correspondent Bill Downs, who returned from the Moscow bureau to the United States with the score.

<text>The Fishing Party was a political party in Scotland formed and officially registered in 2003. Largely a single-issue party, its formation was prompted by those involved in the fishing industry angry at cuts in the quantity of fish they were being allowed to catch as a result of the European Union Single Fisheries Policy. The rationale behind its formation was that they were in the best position to represent the fishing industry as they were part of it themselves. The party was led by George Geddes, formerly vice chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers&#x27; Association, supported by the then Chairman Mike Park, with the aim of securing seats in the Scottish Parliament. The party was supported by Albert McQuarrie, the former Conservative Member of Parliament for Banff and Buchan, but he refused to stand as a candidate on the grounds of age.

There was speculation that this might result in the loss of votes for the Scottish National Party, as traditionally it has won the majority of the votes of those involved in the Scottish fishing industry. However, the Fishing Party did not win any seats in the 2003 election to the Scottish Parliament. Its only candidate, George Geddes, received 5,566 votes (2.28%) on the regional list in North East Scotland. The best result was in the Banff and Buchan Scottish constituency, where the party polled 2,007 votes (7.7%). The party did not stand any candidates in the single-member constituencies.

The party was deregistered as a political party with the Electoral Commission on 23 March 2004.

<doc id="556633" wikidata="Q112481674" url="?curid=556633" title="Enfilade and defilade">
<text>Enfilade and defilade are concepts in military tactics used to describe a military formation&#x27;s exposure to enemy fire. A formation or position is &quot;in enfilade&quot; if weapon fire can be directed along its longest axis. A unit or position is &quot;in defilade&quot; if it uses natural or artificial obstacles to shield or conceal itself from enfilade and hostile fire. The strategies, named by the English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, use the French &quot;&quot; (&quot;to put on a string or sling&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;to slip away or off&quot;) spoken by English nobility of the time.

Enfilade fire—gunfire directed against an enfiladed formation or position—is also commonly known as &quot;flanking fire&quot;. Raking fire is the equivalent term in naval warfare. Strafing, firing on targets from a flying platform, is often done with enfilade fire. It is a very advantageous, and much sought for, position for the attacking force.

== Enfilade ==


A formation or position is &quot;in enfilade&quot; if weapon fire can be directed along its longest axis. For instance, a trench is enfiladed if the opponent can fire down the length of the trench. A column of marching troops is enfiladed if fired on from the front or rear such that the projectiles travel the length of the column. A rank or line of advancing troops is enfiladed if fired on from the side (from the flank).

The advantages of enfilading missiles have been appreciated since antiquity, whether in pitched battles such as the Battle of Taginae or in fortifications designed to provide the defenders with opportunities to enfilade attacking forces. Although sophisticated archery tactics grew rare in Western Europe during the Early Middle Ages, enfilade fire was reemphasized by the late medieval English using ranked archers combined with dismounted knights, first employed at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332 and used to devastating effect against the French in the Hundred Years War. The benefit of enfilading an enemy formation is that, by firing along the long axis, it becomes easier to hit targets within that formation. Enfilade fire takes advantage of the fact that it is usually easier to aim laterally (traversing the weapon) than to correctly estimate the range to avoid shooting too long or short. Additionally, both indirect and direct fire projectiles that might miss an intended target are more likely to hit another valuable target within the formation if firing along the long axis.

When planning field and other fortifications, it became common for mutually supporting positions to be arranged so that it became impossible to attack any one position without exposing oneself to enfilading fire from the others, this being found for example in the mutually supporting bastions of star forts, and the caponiers of later fortifications.

Fire is delivered so that the long axis of the target coincides or nearly coincides with the long axis of the beaten zone.

== Defilade ==

A unit or position is &quot;in defilade&quot; if it uses natural or artificial obstacles to shield or conceal. For an armored fighting vehicle (AFV), defilade is synonymous with a hull-down or turret-down position.

Defilade is also used to refer to a position on the reverse slope of a hill or within a depression in level or rolling terrain. Defiladed positions on hilltops are advantageous because &quot;dead space&quot; – a space that cannot be engaged with direct fire – will be created in front of the position. Ideally, this dead space should be covered by the interlocking fields of fire of other nearby positions, and/or by pre-planned indirect fire such as mortars or other forms of artillery.

In the case of antitank weapons, and especially short-range man-portable antitank rockets, defiladed positions behind a hill have several important advantages. This is because the dead space created by the intervening crest of the hill prevents an approaching tank from using the range of its direct-fire weapons, and neither the attacker nor defender will have a clear shot until the tank is within range of the defending antitank weapon. In such engagements the tank is usually at a further disadvantage because the defender will often be camouflaged while the attacking tank will be silhouetted against the sky, giving the defender an easier shot.

In addition, if the tank fails to detect the defending antitank weapon while the tank is still defiladed, but advances beyond that position to the crest of the hill, it may expose the relatively thinner armor of its lower hull or belly to the defender. Early detection and elimination of antitank threats is an important reason that tanks attack with infantry support.

Artificial entrenchments can provide defilade by allowing troops to seek shelter behind a raised berm that increases the effective height of the ground, within an excavation that allows the troops to shelter below the surface of the ground or a combination of the two. The same principles apply to fighting positions for artillery and armored fighting vehicles.

== Enfilade–defilade combination ==
A unit sited in defilade threatens an enemy that decides to pass it and move forward, because the enemy would be put in an enfiladed position when moving in a rank. The friendly unit would be in a position that is shielded by terrain from direct enemy fire, while still being able to fire on the enemy in an effective manner.

<text>&quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; is a song by the English rock band The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney) and released on the 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It was one of the first songs McCartney wrote; he was about 14, probably in April or May 1956. The song was recorded in a different key than the final version; it was sped up at McCartney&#x27;s request to make his voice sound younger. It prominently features a trio of clarinets (two B clarinets and one bass clarinet).

==Composition==
Paul McCartney wrote the melody to &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; when he was about 14, probably at 20 Forthlin Road in April or May 1956. In 1987, McCartney recalled, &quot;Rock and roll was about to happen that year, it was about to break, [so] I was still a little bit cabaret minded&quot;, and in 1974, &quot;I wrote a lot of stuff thinking I was going to end up in the cabaret, not realizing that rock and roll was particularly going to happen. When I was fourteen there wasn&#x27;t much of a clue that it was going to happen.&quot; 

The song is sung by a young man to his lover, and is about his plans of their growing old together. Although the theme is ageing, it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn suggests it was McCartney&#x27;s second composition, after &quot;Call It Suicide&quot; but before &quot;I Lost My Little Girl&quot;. It was in the Beatles&#x27; setlist in their early days as a song to perform when their amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Lewisohn and George Martin speculated that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in December 1966 because his father, Jim McCartney, had turned 64 earlier that year.

In 1967, John Lennon said of the song, &quot;Paul wrote it in the Cavern days. We just stuck a few more words on it like &#x27;grandchildren on your knee&#x27; and &#x27;Vera, Chuck and Dave&#x27;… this was just one that was quite a hit with us.&quot; In 1972, Lennon said, &quot;I think I helped Paul with some of the words, like &#x27;Vera, Chuck and Dave&#x27; and &#x27;Doing the garden, digging the weeds&#x27;&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s contribution of the children&#x27;s names were likely made in the studio. McCartney&#x27;s manuscript for the song sold for $55,700 () at Sotheby&#x27;s, London in September 1994.

The song uses applied dominants more than the rest of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, in the refrain (B–2–3), in a tonicization of VI in the bridge (B) and, as musicologist Walter Everett puts it, in &quot;the wide array of jaunty chromatic neighbors and passing tones comparable to those in McCartney&#x27;s dad&#x27;s &#x27;Walking in the Park with Eloise&#x27;&quot;.

===Instrumentation===
A clarinet trio (two B clarinets and a bass clarinet) features prominently in the song. Martin said they were added at McCartney&#x27;s request to &quot;get around the lurking schmaltz factor&quot; by using them &quot;in a classical way&quot;. One clarinet provides an alto countermelody in the third verse. The bass clarinet doubles McCartney&#x27;s bass for the retransitional of V7 at C–1–2. During the chorus, the clarinets add texture by playing legato quarter notes while the bass clarinet plays staccato quarter notes. In the song&#x27;s final verse, the clarinet is played in descant with McCartney&#x27;s vocal. Supporting instruments include piano, bass, drum set, tubular bells and electric guitar.

==Recording==
The Beatles recorded two takes of the song on 6 December 1966, during one of the first sessions for the as-yet-unnamed album that became &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Martin produced, supported by engineers Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald. McCartney overdubbed his lead vocal onto take two without the other Beatles present on 8 December. On 20 December, McCartney, Lennon and George Harrison overdubbed backing vocals and Ringo Starr added the sound of bells.

Martin made two reduction mixes (takes three and four) with the latter best. On 21 December, session musicians Robert Burns, Henry MacKenzie and Frank Reidy overdubbed two clarinets and a bass clarinet onto take four. Emerick later said, &quot;The clarinets on that track became a very personal sound for me; I recorded them so far forward that they became one of the main focal points.&quot; Martin recalled, &quot;I remember recording it in the cavernous Number One studio at Abbey Road and thinking how the three clarinet players looked as lost as a referee and two linesmen alone in the middle of Wembley Stadium.&quot; On the same day, Martin remixed the song for mono three times, although this was only a demo version. He made four new mono mixes on 29 December. 

On 30 December, unsatisfied by all of these attempts, McCartney suggested speeding up the track to raise it by around a semitone from its original key of C major to D major. Martin remembers that McCartney suggested this change to make his voice sound younger. McCartney said, &quot;I wanted to appear younger, but that was just to make it more rooty-tooty; just lift the key because it was starting to sound turgid.&quot; Martin, Emerick and Richard Lush made the sped-up remix from take four on 17 April 1967. Musicologist Michael Hannan said of the completed track: &quot;The rich timbres of the clarinets give the mix a fuller, fatter sound than many of the other tracks on the album.&quot;

==Release==
The song was nearly released on a single as the B-side of either &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; or &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. It was instead held over to be included as an album track. Everett said the protagonist of &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band concept, but that he believes the song is thematically unconnected to the rest of the album.

According to author George Case, contemporary listeners perceived all the songs on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as drug-inspired, with 1967 marking the pinnacle of LSD&#x27;s influence on pop music. Some fans viewed the lyric &quot;digging the weeds&quot; from &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; as a possible drug allusion. In August 1967, &quot;The Beatles Book&quot; published an article discussing whether the album was &quot;too advanced for the average pop fan&quot;. One reader complained that all the songs except &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; were &quot;over our heads&quot;, adding, &quot;The Beatles ought to stop being so clever and give us tunes we can enjoy.&quot;

&quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; was included in the Beatles&#x27; 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. It was also used over the opening credits of the 1982 film &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;.

Giles Martin remixed the song for inclusion on the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary release in 2017. He mixed it from the original tapes rather than their subsequent mixdowns. Take 2 of the song was included as a bonus track on the deluxe edition.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Lillian Ross described &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; as a charming and tasteful parody, &quot;but, like the best parody, it is written with affection, and it has an excellence in its own right, independent of its value as parody.&quot; Peter Clayton of &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine called the song a pastiche of George Formby, but added it has &quot;a kind of gentle affectionateness about it – and a certain meaty substance – which raise it well above mere kidding&quot;. In his review of the album for &quot;The Times&quot;, William Mann calls the song a vaudeville number, &quot;which comments pointedly on this old-time vogue and its relevance for modern beat song.&quot;

In Richard Goldstein&#x27;s scathing review of the album for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he said that the song is not mocking in tone, but complained that &quot;an honest vision is ruined by the background which seeks to enhance it.&quot;

In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald describes the song as &quot;aimed chiefly at parents, and as a result got a cool reception from the group&#x27;s own generation&quot;. He adds that the song borrows heavily from Formby&#x27;s English music hall style while invoking the illustrator Donald McGill&#x27;s seaside postcards. Allan Moore views it as a synthesis of ragtime and pop, adding that its position following Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Within You Without You&quot; – a blend of Indian classical music and pop – demonstrates the diversity of the album&#x27;s material. He says the music hall atmosphere is reinforced by McCartney&#x27;s vocal delivery and the recording&#x27;s use of chromaticism, a harmonic pattern that can be traced to Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;The Ragtime Dance&quot; and Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;. He says the complementary nature of young and old found in the song influenced the composition of Oasis&#x27;s 1995 song &quot;She&#x27;s Electric&quot;.

Tim Riley writes that &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; represents &quot;the McCartney side of Elvis&#x27;s corny hokum&quot;. Walter Everett agrees with Riley&#x27;s description, adding, &quot;this penchant for the audience-charming vaudeville sketch led to McCartney preferences that Lennon detested the most.&quot; BBC Music critic Chris Jones calls the song &quot;pure nostalgia for his parents&#x27; golden age&quot; and cites it as an example of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; being &quot;less a kicking out of the jams, more a spreading them on scones at teatime&quot;.

==Personnel==
According to MacDonald and Lewisohn:

The Beatles
*Paul McCartney– lead vocals, piano, bass
*John Lennon– backing vocals, guitar
*George Harrison– backing vocals, guitar
*Ringo Starr– drums, chimes

Additional musicians
*Robert Burns– clarinet
*Henry MacKenzie– clarinet
*Frank Reidy– bass clarinet

==Legacy==
On the occasion of McCartney&#x27;s 64th birthday in June 2006, a month after the singer&#x27;s separation from his wife Heather Mills, Paul Vallely of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote an appreciation that focused on the song&#x27;s message. Describing McCartney&#x27;s birthday as &quot;a cultural milestone for a generation&quot;, Vallely said the widespread support for McCartney and corresponding derision of Mills &quot;tells us more about us than it does about her&quot;. To mark the occasion, McCartney&#x27;s grandchildren recorded a new version of &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; for him at Abbey Road. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sam Roberts likened McCartney&#x27;s failure to fulfil the song&#x27;s promise of retirement-age contentment with Mills to America&#x27;s divorce rates and other socioeconomic problems afflicting citizens in their sixties.

<doc id="556639" wikidata="Q633031" url="?curid=556639" title="The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One">
<text>Prodigy Present: The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One is a 1999 solo mix album by Liam Howlett of The Prodigy (the latter used as a moniker in this case), initially produced for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s mix show &quot;The Breezeblock&quot;.

There are more than 48 tunes from many artists mixed, scratched and cut. The album came about as a result of a 1998 guest DJ appearance by Howlett on Mary Anne Hobbs&#x27;s &quot;Breezeblock&quot; show on BBC Radio 1, producing a similar set.

In a bid to stop popular bootleg copies of the show, an official album was released, essentially an extended version of the &quot;Breezeblock&quot; mix. The two mixes are not exactly the same as permission to use certain tracks was not forthcoming. Most notable is the removal of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, which was also left off The Chemical Brothers&#x27; &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out DJ Mix&quot; but was included in the earlier promo release, &quot;Radio 1 Anti-Nazi Mix&quot;.

==Reception==
* Alternative Press (10/00, p. 120) – Included in AP&#x27;s &quot;10 Essential DJ-Mix Albums&quot; – &quot;Dark, raw and furious&quot;
* Muzik (1/00, p. 84) – Ranked #9 in Muzik&#x27;s &quot;Compilations of the Year &#x27;99&quot; – &quot;...as this glorious mash of styles signifies, Liam Howlett knows a thing or two about pop music... The track sequencing is equally inspiring.&quot;

<text>Robert Thomas Christgau ( ; born April 18, 1942) is an American music journalist and essayist. Among the most influential music critics, he began his career in the late 1960s as one of the earliest professional rock critics and later became an early proponent of musical movements such as hip hop, riot grrrl, and the import of African popular music in the West. He was the chief music critic and senior editor for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; for 37 years, during which time he created and oversaw the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. He has also covered popular music for &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Creem&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, NPR, &quot;Blender&quot;, and &quot;MSN Music;&quot; he was a visiting arts teacher at New York University. CNN senior writer Jamie Allen has called Christgau &quot;the E. F. Hutton of the music world—when he talks, people listen.&quot;

Christgau is best known for his terse, letter-graded capsule album reviews, composed in a concentrated, fragmented prose style featuring layered clauses, caustic wit, one-liner jokes, political digressions, and allusions ranging from common knowledge to the esoteric. His writing is often informed by leftist politics (particularly feminism and secular humanism). He has generally favored song-oriented musical forms and qualities of wit and formal rigor, as well as musicianship from uncommon sources.

Originally published in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; columns during his tenure at &quot;The Village Voice&quot; from 1969 to 2006, the reviews were collected in book form across three decade-ending volumes–&quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), and &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; (2000). Multiple collections of his essays have been published in book form, and a website published in his name since 2001 has freely hosted most of his work.

In 2006, the &quot;Voice&quot; dismissed Christgau after the paper&#x27;s acquisition by New Times Media. He continued to write reviews in the &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; format for &quot;MSN Music&quot;, &quot;Cuepoint&quot;, and &quot;Noisey&quot;–&quot;Vice&quot;″s music section–where they were published in his &quot;Expert Witness&quot; column until July 2019. In September of the same year, he launched a paid-subscription newsletter called &quot;And It Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, published on the email-newsletter platform Substack and featuring a monthly &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column, among other writings.

==Early life==
Christgau was born in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, New York City, on April 18, 1942. He grew up in Queens, the son of a fireman. He has said he became a rock and roll fan when disc jockey Alan Freed moved to the city in 1954.

After attending public school in the city, Christgau attended Dartmouth College graduating in 1962 with a B.A. degree in English. At college, his musical interests turned to jazz, but he quickly returned to rock after moving back to New York. He has said that Miles Davis&#x27;s 1960 album &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; initiated &quot;one phase of the disillusionment (in him) with jazz that resulted in my return to rock and roll.&quot; He was deeply influenced by New Journalism writers including Gay Talese and Tom Wolfe. &quot;My ambitions when I went into journalism were always, to an extent, literary&quot;, Christgau said later.

==Career==
Christgau wrote short stories, before giving up fiction in 1964 to become a sportswriter and later, a police reporter for the &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot;. He became a freelance writer after a story he wrote about the death of a woman in New Jersey was published by &quot;New York&quot; magazine. He was among the first dedicated rock critics. He was asked to take over the dormant music column at &quot;Esquire&quot;, which he began writing in June 1967. He also contributed to &quot;Cheetah&quot; magazine at the time. He then became a leading voice in the formation of a musical–political aesthetic combining New Left politics and the counterculture. After &quot;Esquire&quot; discontinued the column, Christgau moved to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1969, and he also worked as a college professor.

From early on in his emergence as a critic, Christgau was conscious of his lack of formal knowledge of music. In a 1968 piece he commented:

I don&#x27;t know anything about music, which ought to be a damaging admission but isn&#x27;t... The fact is that pop writers in general shy away from such arcana as key signature and beats to the measure... I used to confide my worries about this to friends in the record industry, who reassured me. They didn&#x27;t know anything about music either. The technical stuff didn&#x27;t matter, I was told. You just gotta dig it.

In early 1972, Christgau accepted a full-time job as music critic for &quot;Newsday&quot;. He returned to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1974 as music editor. In a 1976 piece for the newspaper, he coined the term &quot;Rock Critic Establishment&quot; to describe the growth in influence of American music critics. His article carried the parenthesized subtitle &quot;But Is That Bad for Rock?&quot; He listed Dave Marsh, John Rockwell, Paul Nelson, Jon Landau and himself as members of this &quot;establishment&quot;. Christgau remained at &quot;The Village Voice&quot; until August 2006, when he was fired shortly after the paper&#x27;s acquisition by New Times Media. Two months later, Christgau became a contributing editor at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (which first published his review of Moby Grape&#x27;s &quot;Wow&quot; in 1968). Late in 2007, Christgau was fired by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, although he continued to work for the magazine for another three months. Beginning with the March 2008 issue, he joined &quot;Blender&quot;, where he was listed as &quot;senior critic&quot; for three issues and then &quot;contributing editor&quot;. Christgau had been a regular contributor to &quot;Blender&quot; before he joined &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He continued to write for &quot;Blender&quot; until the magazine ceased publication in March 2009. In 1987, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the field of &quot;folklore and popular culture&quot; to study the history of popular music.

Christgau has also written frequently for &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and &quot;Creem&quot;. He appears in the 2011 rockumentary &quot;Color Me Obsessed&quot;, about the Replacements. He previously taught during the formative years of the California Institute of the Arts. As of 2007, he was an adjunct professor in the Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music at New York University.

In August 2013, Christgau revealed in an article written for Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s website that he was writing a memoir. On July 15, 2014, Christgau debuted a monthly column on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s website.

===&quot;Consumer Guide&quot; and &quot;Expert Witness&quot; columns===
Christgau is perhaps best known for his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; columns, which have been published more-or-less monthly since July 10, 1969, in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, as well as a brief period in &quot;Creem&quot;. In its original format, each edition of the &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; consisted of approximately 20 single-paragraph album reviews, each given a letter grade ranging from A+ to E−. The reviews were later collected, expanded, and extensively revised in a three-volume book series, the first of which was published in 1981 as &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot;; it was followed by &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990) and &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; (2000).

In his original grading system from 1969 to 1990, albums were given a grade ranging from A+ to E−. Under this system, Christgau generally considered a B+ or higher to be a personal recommendation. He noted that in practice, grades below a C− were rare. In 1990, Christgau changed the format of the &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; to focus more on the albums he liked. B+ records that Christgau deemed &quot;unworthy of a full review&quot; were mostly given brief comments and star marks ranging from three down to one, denoting an &quot;, records which Christgau believed may be of interest to their own target audience. Lesser albums were filed under categories such as &quot;Neither&quot; (which may impress at first with &quot;coherent craft or an arresting track or two&quot;, before failing to make an impression again) and &quot;Duds&quot; (which indicated bad records and were listed without further comment). Christgau did give full reviews and traditional grades to records he pans in an annual November &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot; column in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, until he left the newspaper in 2006.

In 2001, robertchristgau.com–an online archive of Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; reviews and other writings from his career – was set up as a co-operative project between Christgau and longtime friend Tom Hull; the two had met in 1975 shortly after Hull queried Christgau as &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s regional editor for St. Louis. The website was created after the September 11, 2001, attacks when Hull was stuck in New York while visiting from his native Wichita. While Christgau spent many nights preparing past &quot;Village Voice&quot; writings for the website, by 2002 much of the older &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; columns had been inputted by Hull and a small coterie of fans. According to Christgau, Hull is &quot;a computer genius as well as an excellent and very knowledgeable music critic, but he&#x27;d never done much web site work. The design of the web site, especially its high searchability and small interest in graphics, are his idea of what a useful music site should be&quot;.

In December 2006, Christgau began writing his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; columns for &quot;MSN Music&quot;, initially appearing every other month, before switching to a monthly schedule in June 2007. On July 1, 2010, he announced in the introduction to his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column that the July 2010 installment would be the last on MSN. On November 22, he launched a blog on MSN, called &quot;Expert Witness&quot;, which featured reviews only of albums that he had graded B+ or higher, since those albums &quot;are the gut and backbone of my musical pleasure&quot;; the writing of reviews for which are &quot;so rewarding psychologically that I&#x27;m happy to do it at blogger&#x27;s rates&quot;. He began corresponding with dedicated readers of the column, named as &quot;The Witnesses&quot; after the column. On September 20, 2013, Christgau announced in the comments section that &quot;Expert Witness&quot; would cease to be published by October 1, 2013, writing, &quot;As I understand it, Microsoft is shutting down the entire MSN freelance arts operation at that time ...&quot;

On September 10, 2014, Christgau debuted a new version of &quot;Expert Witness&quot; on &quot;Cuepoint&quot;, an online music magazine published on the blogging platform Medium. In August 2015, he was hired by &quot;Vice&quot; to write the column for the magazine&#x27;s music section, Noisey. In July 2019, the final edition of &quot;Expert Witness&quot; was published.

In September 2019, at the encouragement of friend and colleague Joe Levy, Christgau began publishing the newsletter &quot;And It Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; on the newsletter-subscription platform Substack. Charging subscribers $5 per month, it has his monthly &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column, podcasts, and free weekly content like book reviews. He was skeptical of the platform at first: &quot;Basically I told Joe that if I didn&#x27;t have enough subscribers to pay what I made at Noisey by Christmas I was going to quit. I wasn&#x27;t going to do it for less than that money. I had that many subscribers inside of three days.&quot; By May 2020, &quot;And It Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; had more than 1,000 subscribers. Christgau was ambivalent about the platform at first, but has since found it &quot;immensely gratifying&quot; explaining that, &quot;A man my age, who is still really intellectually active? It is tremendously flattering and gratifying that there are people who are ready to help support me.&quot;

===Pazz &amp; Jop===
Between 1968 and 1970, Christgau submitted ballots in &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual critics&#x27; poll. He selected Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (released late in 1967), The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969), and Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;12 Songs&quot; (1970) as the best pop albums of their respective years, and Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (1970) as the best jazz album of its year. &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; discontinued publication in 1971.

In 1971, Christgau inaugurated the annual Pazz &amp; Jop music poll, named in tribute to &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot;. The poll surveyed music critics on their favorite releases of the year. The poll results were published in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; every February after compiling &quot;top ten&quot; lists submitted by music critics across the nation. Throughout his career at the &quot;Voice&quot;, every poll was accompanied by a lengthy Christgau essay analyzing the results and pondering the year&#x27;s overall musical output. The &quot;Voice&quot; continued the feature after Christgau&#x27;s dismissal. Although he no longer oversaw the poll, Christgau continued to vote and, since the 2015 poll, also contributed essays to the results.

====&quot;Dean&#x27;s Lists&quot;====
Each year that Pazz &amp; Jop has run, Christgau has created a personal list of his favorite releases called the &quot;Dean&#x27;s List&quot;. Only his top ten count toward his vote in the poll, but his full lists of favorites usually numbered far more than that. These lists–or at least Christgau&#x27;s top tens–were typically published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; along with the Pazz &amp; Jop results. After Christgau was dismissed from the &quot;Voice&quot;, he continued publishing his annual lists on his own website and at &quot;The Barnes &amp; Noble Review&quot;.

While Pazz &amp; Jop&#x27;s aggregate critics&#x27; poll are its main draw, Christgau&#x27;s Deans&#x27; Lists are noteworthy in their own right. Henry Hauser from &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; said Christgau&#x27;s &quot;annual &#x27;Pazz &amp; Jop&#x27; poll has been a bona fide American institution. For music writers, his year-end essays and extensive &#x27;Dean&#x27;s List&#x27; are like watching the big ball drop in Times Square.&quot;

These are Christgau&#x27;s choices for the number-one album of the year, including the point score he assigned for the poll. Pazz &amp; Jop&#x27;s rules provided that each item in a top ten could be allotted between 5 and 30 points, with all ten items totaling 100, allowing critics to weight certain albums more heavily if they chose to do so. In some years, he often gave an equal number of points to his first- and second-ranked albums, but they were nevertheless ranked as first and second, not as a tie for first. The list shows only his number-one picks.

==Style and impact==
&quot;Christgau&#x27;s blurbs&quot;, writes &quot;Slate&quot; music critic Jody Rosen, &quot;are like no one else&#x27;s–dense with ideas and allusions, first-person confessions and invective, highbrow references and slang&quot;. Rosen describes Christgau&#x27;s writing as being &quot;often maddening, always thought-provoking... With Pauline Kael, Christgau is arguably one of the two most important American mass-culture critics of the second half of the 20th century... All rock critics working today, at least the ones who want to do more than rewrite PR copy, are in some sense Christgauians.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; magazine said in 2015, &quot;You probably wouldn&#x27;t be reading this publication if Robert Christgau didn&#x27;t largely invent rock criticism as we know it.&quot;

Douglas Wolk said the earliest &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; columns were generally brief and detailed, but &quot;within a few years... he developed his particular gift for &#x27;power, wit and economy&#x27;, a phrase he used to describe the Ramones in a dead-on 37-word review of &quot;Leave Home&quot;&quot;. In his opinion, the &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; reviews were &quot;an enormous pleasure to read slowly, as writing, even if you have no particular interest in pop music... if you do happen to have more than a little interest in pop music, they&#x27;re a treasure.&quot; While regarding the early columns as &quot;a model of cogent, witty criticism&quot;, Dave Marsh in 1976 said &quot;the tone of the writing is now snotty–it lacks compassion, not to mention empathy, with current rock.&quot;

Fans of Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; like to share lines from their favorite reviews. Wolk wrote, &quot;Sting wears his sexual resentment on his chord changes like a closet &#x27;American Woman&#x27; fan&quot; (from Christgau&#x27;s review of the 1983 Police album &quot;Synchronicity&quot;). &quot;Calling Neil Tennant a bored wimp is like accusing Jackson Pollock of making a mess&quot; (reviewing the 1987 Pet Shop Boys album &quot;Actually&quot;); and &quot;Mick Jagger should fold up his penis and go home&quot; (in a review of Prince&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;).

In 1978, Lou Reed recorded a tirade against Christgau and his column on the 1978 live album, &quot;&quot;: &quot;What does Robert Christgau do in bed? I mean, is he a toe fucker? [...] Can you imagine working for a fucking year, and you get a B+ from some asshole in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;?&quot;

Christgau rated the album C+ and wrote in his review, &quot;I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right.&quot; In December 1980, Christgau provoked angry responses from &quot;Voice&quot; readers when his column approvingly quoted his wife Carola Dibbell&#x27;s reaction to the murder of John Lennon: &quot;Why is it always Bobby Kennedy or John Lennon? Why isn&#x27;t it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney?&quot; Similar criticism came from Sonic Youth in their song &quot;Kill Yr Idols&quot;. Christgau responded by saying &quot;Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos–critics just want a little respect. So if it&#x27;s not too hypersensitive of me, I wasn&#x27;t flattered to hear my name pronounced right, not on this particular title track.&quot;

=== Tastes and prejudices ===
Christgau has named Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, and the New York Dolls as being his top five artists of all time. In a 1998 obituary, he called Frank Sinatra &quot;the greatest singer of the 20th century&quot;. He considers Billie Holiday &quot;probably favorite singer&quot;. In his 2000 &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; book, Christgau said his favorite rock album was either &quot;The Clash&quot; (1977) or &quot;New York Dolls&quot; (1973), while his favorite record in general was Monk&#x27;s 1958 &quot;Misterioso&quot;. In July 2013, during an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Gerstenzang, Christgau criticized the voters at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, saying that &quot;they&#x27;re pretty stupid&quot; for not voting in the New York Dolls. When asked about Beatles albums, he said he most often listens to &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;–which he purchased in 1965–and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

Wolk wrote: &quot;When he says he&#x27;s &#x27;encyclopedic&#x27; about popular music, he means it. There are not a lot of white guys in their 60s waving the flag for Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Da Drought 3&quot;, especially not in the same column as they wave the flag for a Willie Nelson/Merle Haggard/Ray Price trio album, an anthology of new Chinese pop, Vampire Weekend, and Wussy...&quot; Christgau reflected in 2004: &quot;Rock criticism was certainly more fun in the old days, no matter how cool the tyros opining for chump change in netzines like &quot;PopMatters&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; think it is now.&quot;

In a broad sense, Christgau says he responds to qualities of &quot;tone, spirit, [and] music&quot;, disregarding, for instance, scholarly analysis of artists such as Bob Dylan. He readily admits to having prejudices and generally dislikes genres such as heavy metal, salsa, dance, art rock, progressive rock, bluegrass, gospel, Irish folk, jazz fusion, and classical music. &quot;I admire metal&#x27;s integrity, brutality, and obsessiveness&quot;, Christgau wrote in 1986, &quot;but I can&#x27;t stand its delusions of grandeur, the way it apes and misapprehends reactionary notions of nobility&quot;. In a 2015 interview, he described heavy metal as &quot;symphonic bombast without the intelligence and complexity, although there&#x27;s a lot of virtuosity.[...] That music is so masculine in a really retrograde way; I don&#x27;t like that at all. It seems to me to have a very 19th-century notion of power.&quot; He said in 2018 that he rarely writes about jazz as it is &quot;hard&quot; to write about in an &quot;impressionistic way&quot;, that he is &quot;not at all well-schooled in the jazz albums of the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s&quot;, and that he has neither the &quot;language nor the frame of reference to write readily about them&quot;. This was even while critiquing jazz artists like Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, and Sonny Rollins; he said &quot;finding the words involves either considerable effort or a stroke of luck&quot;. Christgau has also admitted to disliking the records of Jeff Buckley and Nina Simone, noting that the latter&#x27;s classical background, &quot;default gravity and depressive tendencies are qualities I&#x27;m seldom attracted to in any kind of art.&quot; Writing in a two-part feature on music critics for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1976, Dave Marsh bemoaned Christgau as a &quot;classic, sad example&quot; of how &quot;many critics... superimpos[ed] their own, frequently arbitrary, standards upon performers.&quot; Marsh accused him of becoming &quot;arrogant and humorless–the raves are reserved for jazz artists, while even the best rock is treated condescendingly unless it conforms to Christgau&#x27;s passion for leftist politics (particularly feminism) and bohemian culture.&quot; Marsh named another prejudice of Christgau&#x27;s to be &quot;apolitical or middle-class performers&quot; of rock music.

=== &quot;Dean of American rock critics&quot; ===
Christgau has been widely known as the &quot;dean of American rock critics&quot;, a designation he originally gave to himself while slightly drunk at a press event for the 5th Dimension in the early 1970s. According to Rosen, &quot;Christgau was in his late 20s at the time – not exactly an &quot;éminence grise&quot;–so maybe it was the booze talking, or maybe he was just a very arrogant young man. In any case, as the years passed, the quip became a fact.&quot; When asked about it years later, Christgau said that the title &quot;seemed to push people&#x27;s buttons, so I stuck with it. There&#x27;s obviously no official hierarchy within rock criticism–only real academies can do that. But if you mean to ask whether I think some rock critics are better than others, you&#x27;re damn straight I do. Don&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;For a long time he&#x27;s been called the &#x27;dean of American rock critics&#x27;&quot;, wrote &quot;New York Times&quot; literary critic Dwight Garner in 2015. &quot;It&#x27;s a line that started out as an offhanded joke. These days, few dispute it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Christgau married fellow critic and writer Carola Dibbell in 1974 and they have an adopted daughter, Nina, born in Honduras in 1986. He said that he grew up in a &quot;born-again church&quot; in Queens but has since become an atheist.

Christgau has been long-standing, albeit argumentative, friends with critics Tom Hull, Dave Marsh, Greil Marcus and the late Ellen Willis whom he dated from 1966 to 1969. He has mentored younger critics Ann Powers and Chuck Eddy.

<doc id="556643" wikidata="Q412221" url="?curid=556643" title="Clonidine">
<text>Clonidine, sold under the brand name Catapres among others, is an α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist medication used to treat high blood pressure, ADHD, drug withdrawal (e.g., alcohol, opioids, or nicotine), menopausal flushing, diarrhea, spasticity, and certain pain conditions. The drug is often prescribed off-label for tics. It is used orally (by mouth), by injection, or as a transdermal skin patch. Onset of action is typically within an hour with the effects on blood pressure lasting for up to eight hours.
Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, hypotension, and sleepiness. Severe side effects may include hallucinations, heart arrhythmias, and confusion. If rapidly stopped, withdrawal effects may occur, such as a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Clonidine lowers blood pressure by stimulating α2-adrenergic receptors in the brain, which results in relaxation of many arteries.
Clonidine was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1966. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 71st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Clonidine is used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug withdrawal (alcohol, opioids, or nicotine), menopausal flushing, diarrhea, and certain pain conditions. It also sees some use off-label for episodic insomnia, restless legs syndrome, and anxiety, among other uses.

===Resistant hypertension===
Clonidine may be effective for lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension.

Clonidine works by slowing the pulse rate and exerts a reduction of serum concentrations of renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines.

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Clonidine may improve symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in some people but causes many adverse effects and the beneficial effect is modest. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA. Clonidine, along with methylphenidate, has been studied for treatment of ADHD. While not as effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, clonidine does offer some benefit; it can also be useful in combination with stimulant medications. Some studies show clonidine to be more sedating than guanfacine, which may be better at bedtime along with an arousing stimulant in the morning. Clonidine has been used to reduce sleep disturbances in ADHD, including to help offset stimulant-associated insomnia. Unlike stimulant medications, clonidine is regarded as having no abuse potential, and may even be used to reduce abuse of drugs including nicotine and cocaine.

In the US, only the extended-release form of clonidine is approved for ADHD treatment.

===Drug withdrawal===
Clonidine may be used to ease drug withdrawal symptoms associated with abruptly stopping the long-term use of opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, and nicotine. It can alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms by reducing the sympathetic nervous system response such as tachycardia and hypertension, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hot and cold flashes, and akathisia. It may also be helpful in aiding smokers to quit. The sedation effect can also be useful. Clonidine may also reduce severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome in infants born to mothers that are using certain drugs, particularly opioids. In infants with neonatal withdrawal syndrome, clonidine may improve the neonatal intensive care unit Network Neurobehavioral Score.

Clonidine has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of dexmedetomidine withdrawal.

=== Spasticity ===
Clonidine has some role in the treatment of spasticity caused by spinal cord injury, acting principally by inhibiting excessive sensory transmission . Its use, however, is mainly as a second or third line agent, due to side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and drowsiness. Clonidine can be administered intrathecally, which confers various benefits, including a reduction or prevention of the blood pressure lowering effects and increased effectiveness against spasticity. The effectiveness of intrathecal clonidine is comparable to that of intrathecal baclofen for spasticity.

===Clonidine suppression test===
The reduction in circulating norepinephrine by clonidine was used in the past as an investigatory test for phaeochromocytoma, which is a catecholamine-synthesizing tumor, usually found in the adrenal medulla. In a clonidine suppression test, plasma catecholamine levels are measured before and 3 hours after a 0.3 mg oral test dose has been given to the patient. A positive test occurs if there is no decrease in plasma levels.

===Other uses===
Clonidine also has several off-label uses, and has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Clonidine is also a mild sedative, and can be used as premedication before surgery or procedures. It has also been studied as a way to calm acute manic episodes. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, and postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. Clonidine can be used in restless legs syndrome. It can also be used to treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine has also been used to treat refractory diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, diarrhea associated with opioid withdrawal, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors, and cholera. Clonidine can be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (specifically for tics). Clonidine has also had some success in clinical trials for helping to remove or ameliorate the symptoms of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD).

Injection of α2-adrenergic receptor agonists into the knee joint space, including clonidine, may reduce the severity of knee pain after arthroscopic knee surgery.

Light-activated derivatives of clonidine (adrenoswitches) have been developed for research purposes and shown to control pupillary reflex with light in blind mice by topical application.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
It is classified by the TGA of Australia as pregnancy category B3, which means that it has shown some detrimental effects on fetal development in animal studies, although the relevance of this to human beings is unknown. Clonidine appears in high concentration in breast milk; a nursing infant&#x27;s serum clonidine concentration is approximately 2/3 of the mother&#x27;s. Caution is warranted in women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

==Adverse effects==
The principal adverse effects of clonidine are sedation, dry mouth, and hypotension (low blood pressure).

===Withdrawal===
Because clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow, resulting in lower blood pressure, sudden discontinuation can result in acute hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic outflow. In extreme cases, this can result in a hypertensive crisis, which is a medical emergency.

Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound effects from occurring. Treatment of clonidine withdrawal hypertension depends on the severity of the condition. Reintroduction of clonidine for mild cases, alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers should never be used alone to treat clonidine withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Clonidine crosses the blood–brain barrier.

====High blood pressure====
Clonidine treats high blood pressure by stimulating α2 receptors in the brainstem, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure. It has specificity towards the presynaptic α2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding has a sympatholytic effect, suppresses release of norepinephrine, ATP, renin, and neuropeptide Y which if released would increase vascular resistance.

Clonidine also acts as an agonist at imidazoline-1 (I1) receptors in the brain, and it is hypothesized that this effect may contribute to reducing blood pressure by reducing signaling in the sympathetic nervous system; this effect acts upstream of the central α2 agonist effect of clonidine.

Clonidine may also cause bradycardia, theoretically by increasing signaling through the vagus nerve. When given intravenously, clonidine can temporarily increase blood pressure by stimulating α1 receptors in smooth muscles in blood vessels. This hypertensive effect is not usual when clonidine is given orally or by the transdermal route.

Plasma concentration of clonidine exceeding 2.0 ng/mL does not provide further blood pressure reduction.

==== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ====
In the setting of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clonidine&#x27;s molecular mechanism of action occurs due to its agonism at the α2A adrenergic receptor, the subtype of the adrenergic receptor that is most principally found in the brain. Within the brain, the α2A adrenergic receptors are found within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), among other areas. The α2A adrenergic receptors are found on the presynaptic cleft of a given neuron, and, when activated by an agonist, the effect on downstream neurons is inhibitory. The inhibition is accomplished by preventing the secretion of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Thus, clonidine&#x27;s agonism on α2A adrenergic receptors in the PFC inhibits the action of downstream neurons by preventing the secretion of norepinephrine.

This mechanism is similar to the brain&#x27;s physiological inhibition of PFC neurons by the locus ceruleus (LC), which secretes norepinephrine into the PFC. Although norepinephrine can also bind to target adrenergic receptors on the downstream neuron (otherwise inducing a stimulatory effect), norepinephrine also binds to α2A adrenergic receptors (akin to clonidine&#x27;s mechanism of action), inhibiting the release of norepinephrine by that neuron and inducing an inhibitory effect. Because the PFC is required for working memory and attention, it is thought that clonidine&#x27;s inhibition of PFC neurons helps to eliminate irrelevant attention (and subsequent behaviors), improving the person&#x27;s focus and correcting deficits in attention.

====Growth hormone test====
Clonidine stimulates release of GHRH hormone from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone. This effect has been used as part of a &quot;growth hormone test,&quot; which can assist with diagnosing growth hormone deficiency in children.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After being ingested, clonidine is absorbed into the blood stream rapidly with an overall bioavailability around 70–80%. Peak concentrations in human plasma occur within 60–90 minutes for the &quot;immediate release&quot; (IR) version of the drug, which is shorter than the &quot;extended release&quot; (ER/XR) version. Clonidine is fairly lipid soluble with the logarithm of its partition coefficient (log P) equal to 1.6; to compare, the optimal log P to allow a drug that is active in the human central nervous system to penetrate the blood brain barrier is 2.0. Less than half of the absorbed portion of an orally administered dose will be metabolized by the liver into inactive metabolites, with roughly the other half being excreted unchanged by the kidneys. About one-fifth of an oral dose will not be absorbed, and is thus excreted in the feces. Work with liver microsomes shows in the liver clonidine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (66%), CYP1A2 (10–20%), and CYP3A (0–20%) with negligible contributions from the less abundant enzymes CYP3A5, CYP1A1, and CYP3A4. 4-hydroxyclonidine, the main metabolite of clonidine, is also an α2A agonist but is non lipophilic and is not believed to contribute to the effects of clonidine since it does not cross the blood–brain barrier.

Measurements of the half-life of clonidine vary widely, between 6 and 23 hours, with the half-life being greatly affected by and prolonged in the setting of poor kidney function. Variations in half-life may be partially attributable to CYP2D6 genetics. Some research has suggested the half-life of clonidine is dose dependent and approximately doubles upon chronic dosing, while other work contradicts this. Following a 0.3 mg oral dose, a small study of five patients by Dollery et al. (1976) found half-lives ranging between 6.3 and 23.4 hours (mean 12.7). A similar N=5 study by Davies et al. (1977) found a narrower range of half-lives, between 6.7 and 13 hours (mean 8.6), while an N=8 study by Keraäen et al. that included younger patients found a somewhat shorter mean half-life of 7.5 hours.

==History==
Clonidine was introduced in 1966. It was first used as a hypertension treatment under the trade name of Catapres.

<text>Bangor is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Bangor is located 28 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire in the area commonly called Menai. Bangor sits south of the Georges River and to the west of the Woronora River.

==History==
The name &#x27;Bangor&#x27; was selected in 1895 by the land&#x27;s owner, a farmer named Owen Jones, after his birthplace Bangor in Wales. To avoid confusion with Bangor in Tasmania, the Postmaster General&#x27;s Office changed the suburb name to Menai in 1910. Another Australian Bangor is located in South Australia. Menai Bridge is a town opposite the original Bangor, on the Menai Strait in Wales. When Menai expanded, the eastern section was renamed Bangor in 1976.

As part of the modern development of Bangor, the streets were all named with an Aboriginal theme.

==Population==
In the 2021 census, there were 5,536 people in Bangor. 81.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 3.8%. 81.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek at 1.9%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 29.2%, No Religion 26.8% and Anglican 20.2%.

==Commercial area==
Bangor is a mostly residential suburb with a small suburban shopping centre; In late 2018, the shopping centre commenced renovations. 

==Schools==
* Bangor Public School: Public School Kindergarten to Year 6 
* Inaburra School: Private School Kindergarten to Year 12

==Churches==
*Menai Salvation Army 
*Menai Baptist Church (meeting in Inaburra School)

==Transport==
The main road running through Bangor and Menai is Menai Road. The Bangor Bypass was completed in February 2005 to alleviate traffic in the area.

U-Go Mobility buses (routes 961 and 962) connect Bangor to Menai, Illawong, Alfords Point, Barden Ridge, Padstow, Bankstown, Sutherland, Kirrawee, Gymea and Miranda. Metrobus M92 runs between Sutherland and Parramatta via Bankstown. It also runs a weekend bus service to Cronulla.

The closest train station is Sutherland, on the T4 Illawarra line; although Padstow on the T8 East Hills/Airport line is also frequently used. U-Go Mobility buses service Bangor from both these train stations.

A family friendly cycle way runs from Sutherland to Padstow through Bangor, which links up with the broader Sydney cycle way.

==Sport and recreation==
Bangor has tennis courts at Pyree Street and Yala Road. Yala road sporting facilities also include netball courts. Bangor also has two sporting ovals (Akuna Oval and Billa Oval) named after the roads they are situated on. Bangor is home to the Bangor Brumbies soccer club and its home field is Billa Oval. The Menai Roosters football team uses Akuna Oval as its home oval, as well as the &#x27;Comets&#x27; Bangor-Barden Ridge Cricket Club. The Bangor Tigers Junior AFL team uses fields at Barden Ridge oval as its home ground. The Bangor Scout Group was established in 1986 with a Scout Hall in Ross Reserve in Pyree Street and caters for youth aged from 6 to 26 years old.

The nearby Woronora and Georges rivers and extensive bush areas are popular with the locals and offer a variety of outdoor activities including bush walking, rock climbing/bouldering, mountain bike riding, boating, canoeing, kayaking, rowing and fishing.

A Little Fins Swim School Bangor, a small commercial swimming pool operates from the Bangor Shopping Centre. A larger council run swimming complex and leisure centre operates at Sutherland.

Children&#x27;s playgrounds exist at:

* Akuna Reserve
* Billa Oval,
* Jelba Reserve, Kodala Way Reserve playground, and

<doc id="556652" wikidata="Q138256" url="?curid=556652" title="Saitō Hajime">
<text>(born ; February 18, 1844 – September 28, 1915) was a Japanese samurai of the late Edo period, who most famously served as the captain of the third unit of the Shinsengumi. He was one of the few core members who survived the numerous wars of the Bakumatsu period. He was later known as and worked as a police officer in Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration where he worked mostly undercover for them and for the Japanese government.

==Early years==
He was born in Edo, Musashi Province (now Tokyo). Very little is known about his early life. He was born to , an &quot;ashigaru&quot; of the Akashi Domain, who had bought the rank of &quot;gokenin&quot; (a low-ranking retainer directly serving the Tokugawa shōgun), and his wife . He had an older brother named Hiroaki and an older sister named Katsu. According to the published records of his family, Saitō left Edo in 1862, after accidentally killing a &quot;hatamoto&quot;. He went to Kyoto and taught in the dōjō of a man named Yoshida, who had relied on Saitō&#x27;s father Yūsuke in the past. His style of swordsmanship is not clear. According to a tradition of his descendants, his style comes from Ittō-ryū (One sword style). Saito Hajime&#x27;s swordsmanship style is considered to be Mugai Ryū that originates from Yamaguchi Ittō-ryū. He is also considered to have learned Tsuda Ichi-den-ryū and Sekiguchi-ryū.

==Shinsengumi Period==
The same age as Okita Sōji and another member named Tōdō Heisuke, the three shared the distinction of being the youngest in Kondō Isami&#x27;s group and being among its most gifted swordsmen. As a member of the Shinsengumi, Saitō was said to be an introvert and a mysterious person; a common description of his personality says he &quot;was not a man predisposed to small talk&quot;. Saitō was an unusually tall man at . He was also noted to be very dignified, especially in his later years. He always made sure that his obi was tied properly and when he walked he was careful not to drag his feet. At rest he always sat in the formal position, called seiza, and he would remain very alert so that he could react instantly to any situations that might occur.

He was, however, known to be very intimidating when he wanted to be. Along with his duties as Captain of the Third Squad in the Shinsengumi, he was also responsible for weeding out any potential spies within the Shinsengumi ranks. Members had to constantly be mindful of what they said around him.

His original position within the Shinsengumi was . His duties included being a kenjutsu instructor. During the Ikedaya incident on July 8, 1864, Saitō was with Hijikata Toshizō&#x27;s group that arrived later at the Ikedaya Inn.

On August 20, 1864, Saitō and the rest of the Shinsengumi took part in the Kinmon incident against the Chōshū rebels. In the reorganization of the ranks in November 1864, he was first assigned as the fourth unit&#x27;s captain and would later receive an award from the shogunate for his part in the Kinmon incident.

At the Shinsengumi new headquarters at Nishi Hongan-ji in April 1865, he was assigned as the third unit&#x27;s captain. Saitō was considered to be on the same level of swordsmanship as the first troop captain Okita Sōji and the second troop captain Nagakura Shinpachi. In fact, it is rumoured that Okita feared his sword skill.

Despite prior connections to Aizu, his descendants dispute that he served as a spy. His controversial reputation comes from accounts that he executed several corrupt members of the Shinsengumi; however, rumors vary as to his role in the deaths of Tani Sanjūrō in 1866 and Takeda Kanryūsai in 1867. His role as an internal spy for the Shinsengumi is also questionable; one common example being that he is said to have been instructed to join Itō Kashitarō&#x27;s splinter group Goryō Eji Kōdai-ji faction, to spy on them, which eventually led to the Aburanokōji incident on December 13, 1867. However, this is disputed by Abe Jūrō, who did not believe he was a spy. It is probable that he also monitored other intelligence and enemy activity.

Together with the rest of the Shinsengumi, he became a &quot;hatamoto&quot; in 1867. Later in late December 1867, Saitō and a group of six Shinsengumi members were assigned to protect Miura Kyūtarō, who was one of the major suspects of the assassination of Sakamoto Ryōma. On January 1, 1868, they fought against sixteen assassins who were trying to kill Miura in revenge at the Tenmaya Inn on what was known as the Tenmaya incident.

After the outbreak of the Boshin War from January 27, 1868 onwards, Saitō, under the name , took part in Shinsengumi&#x27;s fight during the Battle of Toba–Fushimi and the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma, before withdrawing with the surviving members to Edo and later to the Aizu domain.

Due to Hijikata being incapacitated as a result of the injuries sustained at the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle, Saitō became the commander of the Aizu Shinsengumi around May 26, 1868 and continued on into the Battle of Shirakawa. After the Battle of Bonari Pass, when Hijikata decided to retreat from Aizu, Saitō and a small group of 20 members parted with Hijikata and rest of the surviving Shinsengumi and continued to fight alongside the Aizu army against the imperial army until the very end of the Battle of Aizu. This parting account was recorded in Kuwana retainer Taniguchi Shirōbei&#x27;s diary, where it was recorded as an occurrence also involving Ōtori Keisuke, whom Hijikata requested to take command of the Shinsengumi; thus the said confrontation was not with Hijikata. However, questions regarding this parting remain, especially considering the conflicting dates.

Saitō, along with the few remaining men of the Shinsengumi who went with him, fought against the imperial army at Nyorai-dō (a small temple near Aizuwakamatsu Castle), where they were severely outnumbered. It was at the Battle of Nyorai-dō that Saitō was thought to have been killed in action; however, he managed to get back to Aizu lines and joined the Aizu domain&#x27;s military as a member of the &quot;Suzakutai&quot;. After Aizuwakamatsu Castle fell, Saitō and the five surviving members joined a group of former Aizu retainers who traveled southwest to the Takada Domain in Echigo Province, where they were held as prisoners of war. In the records listing the Aizu men detained in Takada, Saitō is on record as Ichinose Denpachi.

==Meiji Restoration==
Saitō, under the new name , traveled to Tonami, the new domain of the Matsudaira clan of Aizu. He took up residence with Kurasawa Heijiemon, the Aizu &quot;karō&quot; who was an old friend of his from Kyoto. Kurasawa was involved in the migration of Aizu samurai to Tonami and the building up of the settlements in Tonami (now Aomori Prefecture), particularly in Gonohe village. In Tonami, Fujita met Shinoda Yaso, the daughter of an Aizu retainer. The two met through Kurasawa, who was then living with Ueda Shichirō, another Aizu retainer. Kurasawa sponsored Fujita and Yaso&#x27;s marriage on August 25, 1871; the couple lived in Kurasawa&#x27;s house. It was also around this time that Fujita may have become associated with the Police Bureau. Fujita and Yaso moved out of the Kurasawa house on February 10, 1873, and started living in the Ueda household. When on June 10, 1874, he left Tonami for Tokyo, Yaso moved in with Kurasawa and the Kurasawa family records last entry of her is in 1876. It is unknown what happened afterwards. It was around this time Fujita Gorō began to work as a police officer in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

In 1874, Fujita married Takagi Tokio. Tokio was the daughter of Takagi Kojūrō, a retainer of the Aizu domain. Her original name was Sada; she served for a time as lady-in-waiting to Matsudaira Teru. The marriage is believed to have been sponsored by the former Aizu &quot;karō&quot; Yamakawa Hiroshi and Sagawa Kanbei as well as the former lord of Aizu Matsudaira Katamori. Fujita and Tokio had three children: Tsutomu (1876–1956); Tsuyoshi (1879–1946); and Tatsuo (1886–1945). Tsutomu and his wife Nishino Midori had seven children; the Fujita family continues to the present day through Tarō and Naoko Fujita, the children of Tsutomu&#x27;s second son Makoto. Fujita&#x27;s third son Tatsuo was adopted by the Numazawa family, Tokio&#x27;s maternal relatives (another family of Aizu &quot;karō&quot;) whose family had nearly been wiped out in the Boshin War.


Fujita fought on the Meiji government&#x27;s side during Saigō Takamori&#x27;s Satsuma rebellion, as a member of the police forces sent to support the Imperial Japanese Army.

During his lifetime, Fujita Gorō shared some of his Shinsengumi experiences with a select few, these included Aizu natives Yamakawa Kenjirō and Takamine Hideo, whose houses he frequented. He would drink &quot;sake&quot; with Yamakawa and Takamine and tell stories of his past. However, he did not write anything about his activity in the Shinsengumi as Nagakura Shinpachi did. During his life in the Meiji period, Fujita was the only one who was authorized by the government to carry a katana despite the collapse of the Tokugawa rule. In 1875, Fujita assisted Nagakura Shinpachi (as Sugimura Yoshie) and Matsumoto Ryōjun in setting up a memorial monument known as &quot;Grave of Shinsengumi&quot; in honor of Kondō Isami, Hijikata Toshizō, and other deceased Shinsengumi members at Itabashi, Tokyo.

Following his retirement from Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department in 1890, Fujita worked as a guard for Tokyo National Museum, and later as a clerk and accountant for Tokyo Women&#x27;s Normal School from 1899, as well as for the Tokyo Higher Normal School, jobs he secured thanks to his friendship with Takamine Hideo. Takamine also relied upon Fujita&#x27;s skill as an appraiser of swords, and gave Fujita permission to freely enter his art warehouse.

==Death==

Fujita&#x27;s heavy drinking was believed to have contributed to his death from a stomach ulcer. He died in 1915 at age 72, sitting in &quot;seiza&quot; in his living room. Upon his will, he was buried at Amidaji, Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan.

== Saitō in fiction ==
He has featured in several anime and manga, and is also prominent in other media about the Shinsengumi.

Saitō&#x27;s appearance in Nobuhiro Watsuki&#x27;s &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; series is likely the best-known of his manga and anime incarnations. The series introduces Saitō as an anti-hero and eventual ally to the protagonist Himura Kenshin, and depicts several of the known historical descriptions of him from real life, from his personality and role in the Shinsengumi to his being left-handed. As Watsuki is a self-proclaimed Hijikata Toshizō fan, Saitō makes in-series call-backs to his time in the Shinsengumi by peddling Hijikata&#x27;s &quot;ishida san&#x27;yaku&quot; powdered medicine as a cover, and states that his &quot;Gatotsu&quot; attack is a perfected version of Hijikata&#x27;s &quot;Hiratsuki&quot;. His famous &#x27;swift death to evil&#x27; (aku soku zan) motto in the series was also the theme of an entry in the 2000 International Obfuscated C Code Contest, in which a series of programmed source code featuring his anime portrait in ASCII Art wrote other programs that eventually formed a loop spelling out &quot;aku soku zan&quot;. In the 2012 live-action film adaptation and its sequels Saitō is played by Yōsuke Eguchi.

Keiichiro Washizuka of &quot;The Last Blade&quot; games invokes Saitō Hajime&#x27;s design in the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal&quot; OVA while also sporting Kenshin&#x27;s famous scar. He fights with a series of ‘sliding charge’ attacks that resemble the &quot;Gatotsu&quot;.

He is parodied in the anime &quot;Gintama&quot; as Saitō Shimaru, a narcoleptic with a fear of speaking. In the series, he holds the role of an internal investigator of the Shinsengumi, a post he was said to have held in real life, and is also regarded as its most deadly member by Okita Sougo, the &quot;Gintama&quot; proxy of Okita Sōji.

Saitō is the third unit captain of the Shinsengumi in &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;. Here he is perpetually sleepy with droopy eyes and a soft voice and the supernatural ability to see ghosts. And similar to his depiction in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, he is shown with a fondness for soba.

He is portrayed as a quiet and serious spy in &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot;. He is also the protagonist of the manga &quot;Burai&quot;, a fictional story about the Shinsengumi during the later part of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Saitō is featured in the manga &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot;, in later episodes of the anime &quot;Shura no Toki: Age of Chaos&quot;, and the video game series &quot;Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi&quot; and &quot;Code of the Samurai&quot;.

In the 2003 Japanese film &quot;When the Last Sword Is Drawn&quot;, Saitō is played by Kōichi Satō. At first, Sato portrays Saitō as a cold, dark, uncaring captain of the Shinsengumi. However, Saitō changes as a man through his interactions with Kanichiro Yoshimura (played by Kiichi Nakai) during the last years of the Shinsengumi.

Saitō Hajime is also shown in the &quot;Hakuōki Shinsengumi Kitan&quot; otome visual novel games, as well as its film, anime, and manga adaptations. Here, like his historical inspiration, he is very reserved and analytical, using a left-handed sword technique and later joining Itō&#x27;s splinter group at the order of Hijikata.

He appears in several NHK productions. In the 2004 NHK Taiga drama &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; Saitō is played by Joe Odagiri. Shinji Ozeki portrayed Saitō in the 2011 adaptation Shinsengumi Keppūroku. In the 2013 Taiga drama &quot;Yae no Sakura&quot;, he is played by Kenji Furuya of Dragon Ash, and Shugo Oshinari portrays him in one episode of the NHK historical documentary series &quot;Rekishi Hiwa Historia&quot;.

Saitō also appears in &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku: Ishin!&quot; and its remake &quot;Like a Dragon: Ishin!&quot;, where he is portrayed as a false identity of the game&#x27;s version of Sakamoto Ryōma.

Saitō also appears in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as a limited 4-Star Saber-class Servant which debuted during the GUDAGUDA Yamatai-koku 2020 event.

<text>Bankstown is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located 19 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Canterbury-Bankstown region. Bankstown is the administrative centre of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, having previously been the administrative centre of the City of Bankstown prior to 2016. It is the most populous suburb within the City of Canterbury-Bankstown.

==History==
===Early history===
Before European settlement, Cumberland Plains woodland occupied much of the area. Turpentine ironbark forest covered much of what is now Bankstown. The land was occupied by the Bediagal people. Their land bordered the Dharawal and the Darung people.

In 1795, Matthew Flinders and George Bass explored up the Georges River for about beyond what had been previously surveyed, and reported favourably to Governor Hunter of the land on its banks. Hunter examined the country himself, and established one of the pioneer colonies there, called Bank&#x27;s Town, today written as one word: Bankstown. Hunter named the area Bankstown after Sir Joseph Banks, who travelled to Australia with Captain James Cook in 1770. The area of first European settlement along the river has been partially preserved as part of the Mirambeena Regional Park.

In 1826, bushrangers were hanged on the site of the water tower Bankstown Reservoir.

The first town hall and Council Chambers were opened on 22 Oct 1898 by Mayor Ines Peter Miller on the northern side of the Hume Highway (Liverpool Road), near Rookwood Road (site of the Three Swallows Hotel). In June 1918, the council chambers were relocated to a new building in South Terrace (subsequently Old Town Centre Plaza and, since sometime before 2022, Bankstown City Plaza). The building still stands and now has a shopping arcade running through it. Foundation stones from the old Town Halls have been preserved in a display outside the current Council Chambers.

===World War II===

In 1939, local residents were made privy to the events of World War II. Conscripted residents were required to report for duty at a drill hall on Canterbury Road, Belmore. Camps were set up in and around Canterbury Racecourse and local parks in the district. Residents with foreign names were sent to internment camps as there was growing suspicion about residents with foreign names. A portion of these folk were Australian citizens who served with the Australian Defence Force during World War I.

During World War II, Bankstown Airport was established as a key strategic air base to support the war effort. After the arrival of Douglas MacArthur in Australia, control of Bankstown Airport was handed to US Forces, becoming home to US 35th Fighter Squadron and the 41st Pursuit Squadron of the United States Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces who occupied the airport from 1942 to 1944. In 1945 operations became the responsibility of the British Fleet Air Arm, known as HMS &quot;Nabberley&quot;, until 1946, when it was handed back to the RAAF.

During this period an RAAF unit known as No. 1 Fighter Sector RAAF took control of the Capital Hall in Bankstown. This unit was formed in Bankstown, on 25 February 1942. Their living quarters were located next door and down the road from the hall and the staff were housed in galvanised iron barracks. Operations were handed over to the United States Army Air Corps on 10 April 1942 before they were transferred to a disused railway tunnel at St James railway station in Sydney. The unit was renamed Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ) on 21 January 1945 and moved into a three-storey semi-underground purpose built operations and plotting facility at Bankstown, known as the Bankstown Bunker.

World War II began Bankstown&#x27;s industrial revolution. Few factories or industry of any consequence were located in Bankstown prior to 1945; this was changed dramatically between 1942 and 1954, especially when the Department of Aircraft Production gave approval for aircraft manufacturer Hawker De Havilland to operate a factory at the airport for the production and manufacture of de Havilland Mosquito bombers. There are now over seven-thousand businesses operating within the Bankstown district.

====Bankstown Bunker====

The Bankstown Bunker is a disused RAAF operations facility, located on the corner of Marion and Edgar Street, Bankstown. The specially constructed bunker became an important Royal Australian Air Force headquarters from 1945 until its closure in 1947.

The Bankstown Bunker is of similar design to the underground Ops rooms of wartime England, which directed Britain&#x27;s air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German Luftwaffe. Entrance to the bunker was obtained through a concrete passageway which was well screened by a grassy slope; a stairway led to a maze of corridors and hallways leading to various sections.

The Bankstown bunker is currently buried under a public park, surrounded by residential dwellings at the northern end of Taylor Street.

===Post World War II===
After World War II, Bankstown&#x27;s population increased dramatically. People relocated from the inner-city and incoming migrants came, first as refugees from Europe and towards the end of the 20th century from Asia and the Middle East (especially Vietnamese and Lebanese) and the rest of the world.

Bankstown Council relocated to its third premises in 1963 when the Civic Centre that was located at the corner of Chapel Road and The Mall was constructed. It included the Council Chambers, or &#x27;Roundhouse&#x27;. The current town hall was built in 1973. The administration building which was part of the 1963 premises, was destroyed by fire on 1 July 1997. Council offices relocated to Bankstown Civic Tower (the blue tower) in 1999. On 13 June 2000, Bankstown&#x27;s now popular Central Park, where the former administration building once stood, was officially declared Paul Keating Park.

===Heritage===
Bankstown has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Beresford Avenue: Bankstown Reservoir

==Climate==
Bankstown has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Like most of Western Sydney, it has warm to hot summers and mild winters. The average summer temperature range is from 17.6 °C (63.7 °F) to 27.8 °C (82.0 °F), although hot north-westerly winds can cause temperatures to rise up to 40 °C (104 °F). On average, Bankstown has 8.8 days per year where the temperature rises above 35 °C (95 °F), as opposed to only 3.0 days for Sydney Observatory Hill. The average winter temperature range is from 5.9 °C (42.6 °F) to 18.0 °C (64.4 °F). On an average of one night a year, the minimum temperature falls below freezing (0 °C).

The highest temperature recorded at Bankstown was 46.1 °C (115.0 °F) on 18 January 2013, and the lowest temperature recorded was -4.0 °C (24.8 °F) on 26 July 1968. Bankstown&#x27;s annual mean rainfall is 869.0mm, slightly less than the Sydney CBD, which is affected more by coastal showers which do not penetrate very far inland.

==Commercial area==
Bankstown&#x27;s central business district is clustered around Bankstown railway station. The commercial area beside the railway station is known as Bankstown Plaza, while the ethnic diversity of the area has resulted in a host of restaurants, eateries and cafes.

Bankstown Central, formerly known as Centro Bankstown and previously known as Bankstown Square, is a large shopping centre, immediately to the northeast of the railway station. It was first opened in 1966 and has been expanded a number of times.

Bankstown is the seat of major industry including the aviation, engineering and maintenance at Bankstown Airport. Other employers include small industrial operations, the public service and the retail industry. The suburb is affected with unusually high unemployment and is subject to a dedicated income management program specifically targeting the problem.

==Transport==

Bankstown railway station is on the Bankstown line of the Sydney Trains network. The rail line was built to Belmore in 1895 and then extended to Bankstown in 1909. The line was electrified in 1926. In 1928, the line was extended westwards from Bankstown to join the Main Suburban railway at Lidcombe and the Main South line to Liverpool. The station was semi-closed on 30 September 2024 to allow for the line eastwards to be converted to Sydney Metro standards; the Metro trains will subsequently serve the rebranded Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line.

Bankstown is a major bus interchange for a number of bus services.

The &quot;Sydney Metropolitan Airport&quot;, more commonly known as Bankstown Airport, was established in 1940 and is constructed on 313 hectares. It has three runways, an extensive taxiway and includes a large business park containing over 170 businesses.

==Parks==
Major parks within Bankstown include Bankstown City Gardens, Bankstown Oval, Griffith Park, McLeod Reserve and Paul Keating Park.

&#x27;Bankstown City Gardens&#x27; were opened to the public in 1973. These gardens consist of many unusual types of flora found in Bankstown and the surrounding area. The park consist of different areas, native, tropical, rose garden and Perennial.

&#x27;Paul Keating Park&#x27; was built on the site of Bankstown Council&#x27;s former administration building, after it was destroyed by fire on 1 July 1997.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
In 1862, the Church of England School was first opened and was commissioned as a public school in 1867. Bankstown&#x27;s first public school was built where McLeod Reserve is currently situated in 1880. In 1882 49 boys and 36 girls were enrolled, and upkeep expenses totalled 219 pounds, eight shillings and 11 pence. The school&#x27;s first headmaster was Dugald McLeod who taught at the school since its opening until 1912. The site of the well used by Bankstown Public School is today commemorated by a plaque. The school was demolished in 1924 due to the development of North Bankstown School in the same year. The current Bankstown Public School, located on Restwell Street, opened in 1915. It recently celebrated its centenary (1915–2015). Bankstown West Public School, located on the western side of the suburb, opened in 1931. Since then Bankstown has seen the development of several different educational facilities, such as, Al Amanah College, Bankstown Senior College (formerly Bankstown Boys High School 1963–1991), Bankstown Girls High School, Georges River Grammar School, LaSalle Catholic College and St Euphemia College.

===Tertiary education===
Tertiary institutions located in the suburb include TAFE NSW Bankstown and the Western Sydney University Bankstown City campus.

===Library===

The Bankstown Central Library has served Bankstown on its present site in The Mall since 1954. Eight years earlier in 1946, Bankstown became the first municipality to adopt the Library Act of 1939 by opening a Children&#x27;s Library, located at Restwell Street. The Bankstown Central Library was demolished in 1981 to make way for a different facility which opened in 1983. 

Bankstown&#x27;s current library, the Bankstown Library and Knowledge Centre was opened in April 2014. The library was designed by FJMT and is located next to the Western Sydney University Bankstown Campus.

<text>Botany is a suburb in the south of the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Botany is located 11 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Bayside Council.

Botany sits on the northern shore of Botany Bay, east of Sydney Airport, adjacent to the suburbs of Mascot, Banksmeadow, Pagewood and Port Botany.

==History==

Botany Bay, to the south, is where Captain James Cook first landed on 29 April 1770, when navigating his way around Australia on his ship, the HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The ship&#x27;s English botanist Joseph Banks and Swedish assistant botanist Daniel Solander, spent several days on shore collecting vast numbers of specimens, that were previously unknown in Europe. Cook&#x27;s journals first referred to the bay as Sting Rays&#x27; Harbour, then later Botanist Bay and finally both these names were crossed out and replaced with Botany Bay. The suburb name comes from the bay it stands on.

Botany was originally planned as an agricultural district, in the same way the surrounding suburbs were used for market gardens. However, it became an industrial area with fellmongers yards and slaughter works. In 1809, Mr E Redmond was one of the first to settle here and Simeon Lord (1771–1840) was an important developer in the area who built a fulling mill in 1815. In 1823 he was granted and more grants followed. Part of his estate was subdivided in 1859 to create the Booralee Township and the rest was subdivided in 1887. The Sydney Waterworks were established in Botany in 1858.

The Sir Joseph Banks Hotel was a popular hotel on the shores of Botany Bay. By 1850, a private zoo had been established there and visitors could go horse riding, play cricket and football. International athletes challenged the locals in the Sir Joseph Banks Handicap on the racetrack. In 1988, the Sir Joseph Banks Pleasure Gardens were refurbished with local industry contributions. The racing track was restored and an annual event called the Botany Bay Gift attracted international athletes again. The hotel, which was built in stages from 1840, is now listed on the Register of the National Estate. The other historic landmark in the area is St Matthew&#x27;s Church of England, on the corner of Botany Road and Lord Street. It was built in 1862 and is now on the Register of the National Estate.

===Former tram line service===

The city line to Botany opened in 1882 as a steam tramway, with electric services commencing in 1903. The service from Circular Quay initially via Elizabeth, Chalmers and Redfern Streets (from 1902), then in 1933 via Pitt and Castlereagh Streets, and Eddy Avenue, Lee and Regents Streets, to Botany Street in Waterloo. A single-track connection along Bourke and O&#x27;Dea Streets joined at the present day Green Square, allowing access to the Dowling Street Depot. The line then passed down the entire length of Botany Road to Botany.

In Mascot, a branch led to the former Ascot Racecourse at the site of Sydney Airport. Points were provided at Bay Street on Botany Road in Botany, for short working. The line was double track throughout. From Botany, a single-track line crossed the Botany Goods railway at Beauchamp Road, then passed along Perry Street and Bunnerong Road, past the former Bunnerong Power Station to join the La Perouse line at Yarra Junction. Generally a shuttle service operated on this single track section between Botany and La Perouse. This single-track line was cut back to Military Road in 1935. The line from the junctions at Cleveland Street to Botany closed in 1960. Transdev John Holland bus route 309 generally follows the route.

==Commercial area==
Port Botany is the site of Sydney&#x27;s major port and as such, Botany is a suburb with extensive commercial development centred on shipping and freight. Botany also has a large chemical production facility owned by several companies including Huntsman and Orica (previously ICI). The plant was built in the 1940s and has been owned by Orica since 1997. The plant once manufactured paints, plastics and industrial chemicals such as solvents, and is responsible for a large groundwater plume of pollution in the area. The main shopping centre in Botany runs along Botany Road.
==Sir Joseph Banks Park==
Sir Joseph Banks Park comprises Foreshore Reserve and the Sir Joseph Banks Pleasure Gardens. Foreshore Reserve is 28 hectares of bushland on land reclaimed from Botany Bay. The Reserve features walking tracks through sand dunes to protected wetlands, formed around a network of ponds. The Pleasure Gardens reflect the history of the area with a zoo playground featuring life size animal statues, a mosaic depicting Banks&#x27;s journey, decorative flag terrace, Banksia garden and the central oval running track. A statue of Sir Joseph Banks examining botanical specimens is located in the pleasure gardens.

==Sport and recreation==
A number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area. One of them is the well known NRL club named the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Botany Rams some other teams are Pagewood Botany Soccer Club, Botany Golf Club, Bonnie Doon Golf Club, Eastlake Golf Club and The Lakes Golf Club. Lady Robinsons Beach is a prominent beach in the area.

<text>The Kyrenia Mountains (; ) is a long, narrow mountain range that runs for approximately along the northern coast of the island of Cyprus. It is primarily made of hard crystalline limestone, with some marble. Its highest peak is Mount Selvili, at . Pentadaktylos (also spelt &quot;Pentadactylos&quot;; ; ) is another name for the Kyrenia Mountains, though &quot;Britannica&quot; refers to Pentadaktylos as the &quot;western portion&quot; of the latter, or the part west of Melounta. Pentadaktylos (&quot;lit.&quot; &quot;five-fingered&quot;) is so-named after one of its most distinguishing features, a peak that resembles five fingers.

The Kyrenian mountains are named after the Kyrenian mountains in Achaia, Greece, which are well known from mythology because of the connection with one of the 12 labours of Hercules, the capture of the Kerynitis deer that lived there. This sacred deer of Artemis with golden horns and bronze legs ran so fast that no one could reach it. Hercules, however, after pursuing it for a whole year, managed to catch it and transport it alive to Mycenae.

A devastating fire in July 1995 burned large portions of the Kyrenia Mountains, resulting in the loss of significant forest land and natural habitat.

The only other mountain range in Cyprus is the Troodos Mountains.

==Geology==
These mountains are a series of sedimentary formations from the Permian to the Middle Miocene pushed up by a collision of the African and Eurasian plates. Though only half the height of the Troodos Mountains, the Kyrenia Mountains are rugged and rise abruptly from the Mesaoria plain.

==History==
The location of the mountains near the sea made them desirable locations for watch towers and castles overlooking the northern Cyprus coast, as well as the central plain. These castles generally date from the 10th through the 15th centuries, primarily constructed by the Byzantines and Lusignans. The castles of St. Hilarion, Buffavento, and Kantara sit astride peaks and were of strategic importance during much of the history of Cyprus during the Middle Ages.

==Painted flag==
A flag of Northern Cyprus is painted on the southern slope of the Kyrenia Mountains. It is reportedly 425metres wide and 250metres high, and is illuminated at night.

The flag is considered controversial as evidenced in the Parliamentary Question put to the European Parliament by Antigoni Papadopoulou on 22 October 2009, &quot;How can it permit the existence of such a flag which, apart from the catastrophic environmental damage it causes, the use of chemical substances and the brutal abuse of the environment, involves an absurd waste of electricity at a time of economic crisis? Does Turkey show sufficient respect towards the environment to justify its desire to open the relevant chapter of accession negotiations?&quot; 

==Legends==
There are many legends about the Pentadactylos mountains. One tells the story of a conceited villager who fell in love with the local queen and asked for her hand in marriage. The queen wished to be rid of the impertinent young man and requested that he bring her some water from the spring of Apostolos Andreas monastery in the Karpas, a perilous journey in those days. The man set off and after several weeks returned with a skin full of that precious water. The queen was most dismayed to see that he had succeeded, but still refused to marry him. In a fit of rage, he poured the water on to the earth, seized a handful of the resulting mud and threw it at the queens head. She ducked and the lump of mud sailed far across the plain to land on top of the Kyrenia mountain range, where it is to this day, still showing the impression of the thwarted villager’s five fingers.

Another famous one is of the Byzantine hero Digenis Akritas. Tradition has it that Digenis Akritas&#x27;s hand gripped the mountain to get out of the sea when he came to free Cyprus from its Saracen invaders, and this is his handprint. He also threw a large rock across Cyprus to get at the Saracen ships. That rock landed in Paphos at the site of the birthplace of Aphrodite, thus known to this day as Petra Tou Romiou or &quot;Rock of the Greek&quot;.

<doc id="556674" wikidata="Q236630" url="?curid=556674" title="Marcel Pagnol">
<text>Marcel Paul Pagnol ( ; ; 28 February 1895 – 18 April 1974) was a French novelist, playwright, and filmmaker. Regarded as an auteur, in 1946, he became the first filmmaker elected to the . Pagnol is generally regarded as one of France&#x27;s greatest 20th-century writers and is notable for the fact that he excelled in almost every medium—memoir, novel, drama and film.

==Early life==
Pagnol was born on 28 February 1895 in Aubagne, Bouches-du-Rhône department, in southern France near Marseille, the eldest son of schoolteacher Joseph Pagnol and seamstress Augustine Lansot. He was secretly baptised at the Église Saint-Charles in Marseilles. Marcel Pagnol grew up in Marseille with his younger brothers Paul and René, and younger sister Germaine.

=== School years ===
In July 1904, the family rented the &quot;Bastide Neuve&quot;, – a house in the sleepy Provençal village of La Treille – for the summer holidays, the first of many spent in the hilly countryside between Aubagne and Marseille. About the same time, Augustine&#x27;s health, which had never been robust, began to noticeably decline and on 16 June 1910 she succumbed to a chest infection (&quot;mal de poitrine&quot;) and died, aged 36. Joseph remarried in 1912.

In 1913, at the age of 18, Marcel passed his baccalaureate in philosophy and started studying literature at the university in Aix-en-Provence. When World War I broke out, he was called up into the infantry at Nice but in January 1915 he was discharged because of his poor constitution (&quot;&quot;faiblesse de constitution&quot;&quot;). On 2 March 1916, he married Simone Colin in Marseille and in November graduated in English. He became an English teacher, teaching in various local colleges and at a lycée in Marseille.

==Career==

=== Time in Paris===
In 1922, he moved to Paris, where he taught English until 1927, when he decided instead to devote his life to playwriting. During this time, he belonged to a group of young writers, in collaboration with one of whom, Paul Nivoix, he wrote the play, &quot;Merchants of Glory&quot;, which was produced in 1924. This was followed, in 1928, by &quot;Topaze&quot;, a satire based on ambition. Exiled in Paris, he returned nostalgically to his Provençal roots, taking this as his setting for his play &quot;Marius&quot;, which later became the first of his works to be adapted into a film in 1931.

Separated from Simone Collin since 1926 (though not divorced until 1941), he formed a relationship with the young English dancer Kitty Murphy. Their son Jacques Pagnol was born on 24 September 1930. (Jacques later became his father&#x27;s assistant and subsequently a cameraman for France 3 Marseille.)

=== Filmmaking career ===
In 1929, on a visit to London, Pagnol attended a screening of one of the first talking films and he was so impressed that he decided to devote his efforts to cinema. He contacted Paramount Picture studios and suggested adapting his play &quot;Marius&quot; for cinema. The film was directed by Alexander Korda and released on 10 October 1931. It became one of the first successful French-language talking films.

In 1932, Pagnol founded his own film production studios in the countryside near Marseille. Over the next decade Pagnol produced his own films, taking many different roles in the production – financier, director, script writer, studio head, and foreign-language script translator – and employing the greatest French actors of the period. On 4 April 1946, Pagnol was elected to the , taking his seat in March 1947, the first filmmaker to receive this honour.

=== Themes of Pagnol&#x27;s films ===
In his films, Pagnol transfers his playwriting talents onto the big screen. His editing style is somberly reserved, placing emphasis on the content of an image. As a pictorial naturalist, Pagnol relies on film as art to convey a deeper meaning rather than solely as a tool to tell a story. Pagnol also took great care in the type of actors he employed, hiring local actors to appear in his films to highlight their unique accents and culture. Like his plays, Pagnol&#x27;s films emphasize dialogue and musicality. The themes of many of Pagnol&#x27;s films revolve around the acute observation of social rituals. Using interchangeable symbols and recurring character roles, such as proud fathers and rebellious children, Pagnol illuminates the provincial life of the lower class. Notably, Pagnol also frequently compares women and land, showing both can be barren or fertile. Above all, Pagnol uses all this to illustrate the importance of human bonds and their renewal.

=== As a novelist ===
In 1945, Pagnol remarried, to Jacqueline Bouvier (the actress Jacqueline Pagnol). They had two children together, Frédéric (born 1946) and Estelle (born 1949). Estelle died at the age of two. Pagnol was so devastated that he fled the south and returned to live in Paris. He went back to writing plays, but after his next piece was badly received he decided to change his job once more and began writing a series of autobiographical novels – &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;enfance&quot; – based on his childhood experiences.

In 1957, the first two novels in the series, &quot;La Gloire de mon père&quot; and &quot;Le château de ma mère&quot; were published to instant acclaim. The third &quot;Le Temps des secrets&quot; was published in 1959, the fourth &quot;Le Temps des Amours&quot; was to remain unfinished and was not published until 1977, after his death. In the meantime, Pagnol turned to a second series, &quot;L&#x27;Eau des Collines&quot; – &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; – which focused on the machinations of Provençal peasant life at the beginning of the twentieth century and were published in 1962.

Pagnol adapted his own film &quot;Manon des Sources&quot;, with his wife Jacqueline in the title role, into two novels, &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot;, collectively titled &quot;L&#x27;Eau des Collines&quot;.

==Later life==
Pagnol appeared before a review committee of the Parisian Comite Regional Interprofessionnel d&#x27;Epuration on 27 November 1946 for three charges of collaboration. His charges were for adding Philippe Pétain&#x27;s armistice speech into &quot;The Well-Digger&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, allowing &quot;La France en Marche&quot;, a Vichy propaganda film series, to be processed at his laboratories in Marseille, and distributing a propaganda short about the attack on Mers-el-Kébir. Pagnol defended himself as the Germans banned &quot;The Well-Digger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 1941 and only unbanned it after the Pétain scene was removed and that the Vichy government seized his studios, personnel, and distribution services. All charges against him were dismissed on 3 February 1947.

Pagnol died in Paris on 18 April 1974. He is buried in Marseille at the cemetery &quot;La Treille&quot;, along with his mother, father, brothers, and wife. His boyhood friend, David Magnan (&quot;Lili des Bellons&quot; in the autobiographies), who died at the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918, is buried nearby.

== Translations ==
Pagnol was also known for his translations of Shakespeare (from English) and Virgil (from Latin):
*1944 : &quot;Le Songe d&#x27;une nuit d&#x27;été&quot; (&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;) by William Shakespeare, first presented in 1947, at the Grand Théâtre de Monaco; Paris, Œuvres complètes, Club de l&#x27;Honnête Homme, 1971
*1947 : &quot;Hamlet&quot; by William Shakespeare, Paris, Nagel
*1958 : &quot;Bucoliques&quot; (&quot;The Eclogues&quot;) by Virgil, Paris, Grasset

Pagnol&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; is still performed in France, although some have criticized his portrayal of Hamlet as somewhat effeminate.

== Film adaptations ==

In 1986, &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; were adapted by filmmaker Claude Berri.

In 1990, &quot;La Gloire de mon père&quot; and &quot;Le château de ma mère&quot;, Pagnol&#x27;s affectionate reminiscences of childhood, were filmed by Yves Robert.

In 2000, Jacques Nahum produced &quot;Marius&quot;, &quot;Fanny&quot;, and &quot;César&quot; for French television.

In 2011, &quot;La Fille du puisatier&quot; was filmed by Daniel Auteuil.

In 2013, &quot;Marius&quot; and &quot;Fanny&quot; were remade by Daniel Auteuil.

In 2022, Le Temps Des Secrets was adapted and filmed by Christophe Barratier.

<text>Bundeena is a village and suburb on the outskirts of southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Bundeena is located south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the Sutherland Shire.

Bundeena is adjacent to the village of Maianbar and lies on the southern side of Port Hacking, opposite the suburbs of Cronulla and Burraneer. The village is surrounded by the Royal National Park.

The beaches at Bundeena are Jibbon Beach, Gunyah Beach, Horderns Beach and Bonnie Vale Beach. Cabbage Tree Creek and &#x27;The Basin&#x27; separate Bundeena from the smaller village of Maianbar. A bush track and footbridge link the two villages. Bonnie Vale is also one of the few camp grounds within the Royal National Park.

==Transport==

Bundeena may be reached by passenger ferry from Cronulla or by road through the Royal National Park from Sutherland or Waterfall. Cronulla and National Park Ferry Cruises provides regular ferry services between Cronulla and Bundeena. The wharf at Cronulla is located on Gunnamatta Bay, near Cronulla railway station. Ferry trips vary from 20 to 30 minutes depending on the weather. Many people from Bundeena drive to the railway station at Sutherland, as it is only a 25-minute drive as opposed to 30 minutes by ferry to Cronulla and then a 15-minute train trip to Sutherland.

Maianbar Bundeena Bus Service operates bus route 989 for local bus services between Bundeena and Maianbar on school days only. In addition there is one return trip every Wednesday to Engadine and one return trip every Friday to Miranda both via Maianbar.

==Environment==
During early colonial settlement, Indonesian rusa deer were introduced and have since become a large population in the area. Many residents see the deer as pests, but they are a protected species, although the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service are permitted a small yearly cull. However many residents also take delight in the deer, which causes much division and emotion in the affected townships.

==History==
Bundeena is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;noise like thunder&quot; (presumed to be a reference to the sound of the waves crashing on Horderns Beach). Aboriginal rock engravings made by Dharawal people can be found at Jibbon Head.

Bass and Flinders investigated the area in 1796, deciding that it was not a suitable location for a settlement. In 1815 there were reports of criminals in the Cabbage Tree Creek region who were producing sly grog. They used the caves along the foreshore for storage.

Bundeena&#x27;s first authorised white settler, Owen Byrne, was granted land at the site in 1832. George Simpson received a land grant at the adjacent Bonnie Vale in 1863. Simpson&#x27;s Hotel was opened in the area now known as Simpsons Bay by George&#x27;s son, William, in the 1870s. The sandstone Simpson&#x27;s House (1870s) is still standing at what is now Bonnie Vale Campground.

A wharf was built in 1890 and W.A. Hodgkinson conducted a launch service from Gunnamatta Bay in 1908. Captain R.R. Ryall commenced the Cronulla to Bundeena ferry service in 1915. The Wharf was reconstructed in 1920. The district&#x27;s first store commenced operations at the beginning of the 1930s. Bundeena Public School opened on 14 September 1948.
==Education==
Bundeena Public School began in September 1948, with classes initially held in the RSL hall. Bundeena Library operates out of Bundeena Public School on Mondays and Wednesdays after school hours and Saturday mornings.

== Sport ==
Bundeena is home to the soccer club Bundeena-Mainbar FC, who play at Bundeena Oval. Bundeena Oval also hosts Bundeena Little Athletics.

==Demographics==
According to the of Population, there were 2,103 residents in Bundeena. 73.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 6.7%. 88.6% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 48.3%, Catholic 18.8% and Anglican 13.0%.

<text>Panfilo &quot;Ping&quot; Morena Lacson Sr. (; born June 1, 1948) is a Filipino former politician and police general who served as a senator for three terms: from 2001 to 2013 and from 2016 to 2022. He was the Director General of the Philippine National Police (PNP) from 1999 to 2001, and was a candidate in the 2004 and 2022 Philippine presidential elections.

During his tenure as the chief of the PNP, he was known for instituting various reforms within the organization. Despite some controversies, his high approval rating and high-profile anti-corruption campaigns paved the way for his Senate bid in 2001, where he won and placed tenth in the elections. In January 2001, Lacson&#x27;s withdrawal of police support for President Joseph Estrada was critical to Estrada&#x27;s ouster in EDSA II. However, after Estrada was arrested on April 25, 2001, Lacson was among the politicians who spoke against his removal from office at pro-Estrada rallies that preceded the May 1 riots near Malacañang Palace. He ran for the presidency in 2004 but lost, though he continued to serve as senator until 2007. He won another six-year term in 2007.

After his first two terms in the Senate, Lacson was appointed by then-President Benigno Aquino III as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery in December 2013. He led the management and rehabilitation efforts of the central provinces in the Philippines affected by Typhoon Yolanda.

While he initially planned to run for president again in 2016, he opted to run for the Senate in the 2016 elections. He won and ranked fourth in the said elections.

Lacson went on for another attempt for the presidency of the Philippines during the 2022 Philippine presidential election, however he placed 5th in the race receiving 1.66% of the total vote. After the elections, Lacson said he would contribute to food security through an agri-aqua business.

On September 26, 2024, Lacson, who is running as an independent candidate, was among 12 bets endorsed by President Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Marcos Jr. for the 2025 senatorial elections. He formalized his candidacy by filing his certificate of candidacy before the Comelec on October 2, 2024.

His career as a police officer became the basis for two local action films: &quot;Task Force Habagat&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ping Lacson: Super Cop&quot; (2000).

==Early life and education==
Panfilo Morena Lacson was born in Imus, Cavite on June 1, 1948. His mother, Maxima, a market vendor, was a disciplinarian who instilled distinctions between right and wrong with her children. His father, Buenaventura, was a jeepney driver whose experiences with &quot;kotong cops&quot; (extortionist policemen) eventually inspired him to fight extortion and other forms of corruption. In a post on X/Twitter in May 2024, Lacson also said he got his &quot;discipline, integrity and survival instinct&quot; from his mother.

He finished grade school at the Bayan Luma Elementary School in 1960 and high school at the Imus Institute in 1964. While Lacson initially wanted to be an agent of the National Bureau of Investigation, he was invited by a classmate to take the entrance exams at the Philippine Military Academy. Lacson passed but the classmate who invited him did not.

After his graduation from the PMA in 1971, Lacson was commissioned in the Philippine Constabulary (PC), then a major service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) responsible for maintaining peace and order and enforcement of laws in the country.

In 1996, he earned a postgraduate degree of Master in Government Management from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.

Meanwhile, Lacson&#x27;s advocacy against the pork barrel system and the corruption associated with him was cited by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila when it conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, on March 27, 2019.

Lacson also received from the Philippine Military Academy the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award on February 19, 2022, in recognition of his &quot;more than 50 years of “dedicated, exemplary and unblemished service to the country characterized by his faithful adherence to the virtues of Courage, Loyalty and Integrity.&quot;

==Police career==
===Early career: PC, PNP, PACC (1971–1999)===
Lacson worked at the Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command (Metrocom)&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Group (MISG) from 1971 to 1986. Lacson, whose work involved mainly intelligence-gathering, rose through the ranks, becoming Lieutenant Colonel in the mid-1980s. After the 1986 People Power Revolution, he served at the PC-INP Anti-Carnapping Task Force as its commander from 1986 to 1988, as provincial commander of the province of Isabela from 1988 to 1989, and as commander of the Cebu Metropolitan District Command (Metrodiscom) from 1989 to 1992. In 1991, he joined the then-newly created civilian Philippine National Police, or PNP, formed as a result of the merger of the military Philippine Constabulary and the civilian Integrated National Police or INP. (The INP was formed in 1975 as an integration of all local police forces in the country then under operational control of the PC.) Soon Lacson became Provincial Director of the province of Laguna from February to July 1992. Afterwards, he was appointed Chief of Task Force Habagat at the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission from 1992 to 1995. From 1996 to April 1997, he was given the task of project officer of &quot;Special Project Alpha.&quot; Lacson was appointed Chief of the PNP on November 18, 1999.

American historian Alfred W. McCoy claimed in his 1999 book &quot;Closer Than Brothers&quot; that Lacson was among those in MISG who tortured prisoners during martial law in the 1970s, which Lacson has vehemently denied. A court case filed in 1983 by alleged martial law torture victims against Lacson and other military officers was closed by 2012 when the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal&#x27;s 2003 ruling that reversed the Quezon City Regional Trial Court&#x27;s order for the military officers to pay damages to their alleged victims due to the decision lacking &quot;procedural due process&quot;.

====Anti-kidnapping and no-take policy====
While serving in the Philippine Constabulary&#x27;s Metropolitan Command, Lacson&#x27;s work involved mainly solving crimes, including kidnap-for-ransom incidents. In 1981, Lacson was a Lieutenant Colonel with the PC-Metrocom, when he led a team that rescued now-tycoon Robina Gokongwei-Pe, daughter of businessman John Gokongwei Jr., from a kidnap-for-ransom gang.

Robina&#x27;s family offered Lacson and his team a reward, but Lacson declined it, as part of his no-take policy. Lacson explained he does not want his men to have the wrong mentality of not helping &quot;gusgusin&quot; (poor) complainants who cannot afford to give them rewards. The Gokongweis eventually decided to show their gratitude by donating mobile patrol vehicles to the PC, coursing it through then PC chief Maj. Gen. Fidel Ramos.

In a Twitter post, Lacson recalled advising the elder Gokongwei not to sound intimidated while negotiating with the kidnappers. He said that after Robina&#x27;s rescue, the elder Gokongwei offered P400,000 as reward money, which he declined. Instead, Gokongwei donated 10 mobile cars to the PC Metrocom. Robina recounted details of the incident in her eulogy to her father.

Lacson, who would later head the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001, founded the PNP Foundation in 2000, as a way for civic-minded people to give contributions for the benefit of the PNP as an institution.

During his stint in Cebu, Lacson rescued the son of a Cebu-based retail magnate. The victim&#x27;s family intended to give the money they prepared as ransom to Lacson and his operatives as a reward, but Lacson declined it. Lacson was said to have told the victim&#x27;s family that a mere &quot;thank you&quot; was more than enough for him.
In 1992, Lacson was recruited to the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission chaired by then Vice President Joseph Estrada. Lacson headed the PACC&#x27;s Task Force Habagat, which would go on to solve several kidnap-for-ransom cases.

====Anti-jueteng campaign====

Aside from kidnap-for-ransom gangs, jueteng and other forms of illegal gambling were also in Lacson&#x27;s sights when he was in the PC, and eventually in the Philippine National Police.

In 1992, he bared an attempt by local jueteng operators in Laguna to bribe him, initially to the tune of P1.2 million a month. He rejected the offer.

Lacson maintained an all-out effort against jueteng, even if in the process he crossed paths with eventual President Joseph Estrada.

===PAOCTF chief (1998–2001)===
Under the Estrada administration, Lacson headed the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF), bringing to zero the number of kidnap-for-ransom cases. The PAOCTF also scored high against drug trafficking, smuggling activities, carnapping, illegal possession of firearms and other nefarious activities.

===PNP chief: Reforms and kotong cops (1999–2001)===
While heading the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF), he was appointed to serve as Philippine National Police Chief in 1999, but did not get his 4-star rank due to former Santiago Aliño&#x27;s retirement issues since 1998. He only got the 4-star rank in March 2000.

Lacson&#x27;s notable accomplishments were the reduction of corrupt policemen (Kotong Cops) and various organized crime syndicates engaged in kidnapping, drug trafficking, and other illegal activities.

As Chief PNP, Lacson eliminated the &quot;Kotong culture&quot; (bribe culture) among the police officers. He rationalized the distribution of financial and logistical resources by downloading 85 percent to the police frontline units, retaining only 15 percent in the police headquarters. He imposed a strict physical fitness test on all PNP members, invoking a 34-inch maximum waistline for police officers.

Lacson refused to accept bribe money from illegal gambling operators and contractors and suppliers transacting business with the PNP, declining offers of monetary rewards from kidnap-for-ransom victims after rescuing them from their captors.

Meanwhile, Lacson downloaded 85% of the PNP&#x27;s budget to the operating units to improve the overall management, while removing excess privileges of top police officials.

Most importantly, Lacson stopped the practice of &quot;kotong cops,&quot; who extort money from public utility drivers, vegetable and rice dealers, and vendors.

Under Lacson&#x27;s leadership, the PNP earned a whopping 64% approval rating in July and October 2000, the highest ever recorded from the Filipino people. Lacson himself got an approval rating of 73% as Chief PNP in July 2000, thus regaining the PNP&#x27;s glory years by restoring public trust in the police force.

Lacson resigned on January 22, 2001, due EDSA Dos, but only retired formally on March 16, 2001. That late retirement made Leandro Mendoza&#x27;s promotion to the rank Director General delayed, even Mendoza was instilled as the new PNP Chief.

====Kuratong Baleleng case====

The Kuratong Baleleng of the 1990s was a criminal gang linked to a series of violent crimes that included kidnappings and bank robberies. In some of the robberies, the gang&#x27;s members would gun down security guards and innocent bystanders.

In 1995, members of a composite task group assigned to stop robberies in Metro Manila were linked to the killing of 11 members of Kuratong Baleleng in Quezon City. The PACC was a part of the composite task force.

In 2003, the High Tribunal ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to try the case against Lacson and 33 other police officials. The trial court dismissed the criminal case, finding absence of probable cause. The special prosecuting team later moved for new trial before the High Tribunal to remand case to the trial court to present new evidence against then-Senator Lacson, inter alia. On May 2, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolved to take cognizance of the motion of the families of the slain Kuratong Baleleng members for revival of the murder case against police officials and Senator Panfilo Lacson.

On November 13, 2012, the Supreme Court in an en banc decision denied the government&#x27;s motion to revive the case and affirmed the lower court&#x27;s decision dismissing it.

====Dacer–Corbito murder case====

On November 24, 2000, publicist Salvador &quot;Bubby&quot; Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito were abducted in Makati. In April 2001, their burnt corpses were found by a creek in Indang, Cavite. The Department of Justice filed double murder charges against Police Senior Superintendent Michael Ray Aquino and other police officers, including Senior Superintendent Cezar Mancao II and Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao – all members of Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) headed by then Police Director-General Panfilo Lacson.

In his 2001 affidavit, Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao implicated then President Joseph Estrada and then Director-General Panfilo Lacson in the Dacer–Corbito Murder Case. Both Estrada and Lacson denied their involvement.

In 2009, former police senior superintendent Cezar Mancao II named Lacson as the mastermind of the murders of Salvador Dacer and Emmanuel Corbito. The allegations were made in an affidavit that Mancao signed on February 14, 2009. Mancao was allegedly present when Lacson gave the hit order to then Police Senior Superintendent Michael Ray Aquino sometime in October 2000.

Lacson denied these allegations, stating that the Office of the President had pressured Mancao to sign the affidavit.

On January 5, 2010, Lacson left the Philippines on a Cathay Pacific flight to Hong Kong, shortly before charges against him were filed in court. He became a fugitive for the next fifteen months. He had been spotted in Hong Kong and Rome but was never apprehended.

On February 5, 2010, Branch 18 of the Regional Trial Court in Manila issued an arrest warrant against him. On February 11, 2010, Interpol issued a Red Notice for Lacson.

On February 3, 2011, the Court of Appeals withdrew the murder charges against the senator (SP-116057). Its decision cited Mancao as &quot;not a credible and trustworthy witness&quot;. Mancao has since turned fugitive after escaping from the custody of the National Bureau of Investigation in May 2013.

Lacson returned to the country on March 26, 2011, a month after the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals&#x27; ruling on the case.

In a 2015 interview with the media, Mancao (still a fugitive) apologized to Lacson and Estrada for linking them in the Dacer–Corbito murders, admitting that he had no personal knowledge on the supposed involvement of the two. He also claimed that he was forced by the Arroyo administration to implicate their names.

===PNP Foundation Chairman===
While he has retired from the police service, Lacson continues to help the PNP in his capacity as chairman of the PNP Foundation Inc., which donates equipment and other needs of the police force - including support for a project to put up an Open University in collaboration with the University of the Philippines. This will allow PNP personnel to take up required and special training courses online, without necessarily leaving their places of assignment.

As senator from 2017 to 2022, Lacson also amended to augment the budget of the PNP in the annual General Appropriations Act in the total amount of P8,069,970,000 - aside from authoring, sponsoring or co-authoring landmark legislations benefiting the PNP. &quot;I can proudly say without mental reservation and fear of contradiction, being your former Chief, I have paid my dues to the men and women of this proud organization both active and retired,&quot; Lacson said in his remarks before the PNP on Aug. 15, 2022.

==Political career==
===EDSA Tres===
From April 26 to 30, 2001, together with Juan Ponce Enrile, Gregorio Honasan, Miriam Defensor Santiago and Tito Sotto, he spoke at the EDSA III rallies that called for Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#x27;s resignation and the reinstatement of Estrada to the presidency. On May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed Malacañang Palace.

===First two Senate terms (2001–2013)===
Lacson ran for senator in the 2001 elections under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), which was affiliated with Estrada&#x27;s &quot;Puwersa ng Masa&quot; coalition. He won a seat in the Senate, finishing in tenth place.

In late 2006, Lacson said he might run as mayor of the city of Manila in the 2007 midterm elections. However, he rescinded that decision and instead ran for a second Senate term under the Genuine Opposition coalition. He won reelection in the 2007 senatorial elections senatorial elections, ranking third.

On March 11, 2003, Lacson delivered a speech entitled Living Without Pork, exposing the evils and temptations presented by the pork barrel system, and called for its total abolition. During deliberations on the national budget, he stated he would make sure his PDAF allocation reverted to the National Treasury – in the process saving the government some PhP2.4 billion during his first 12 years in the Senate.

Lacson&#x27;s advocacy against the pork barrel system and the corruption associated with him was cited by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila when it conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, on March 27, 2019.

Meanwhile, his alma mater, the Philippine Military Academy, conferred on him on February 19, 2022, the Lifetime Achievement Award citing his more than 50 years of “dedicated, exemplary and unblemished service to the country characterized by his faithful adherence to the virtues of Courage, Loyalty and Integrity.”

Lacson filed bills that aimed to improve public service, enhance reproductive health, promote investments, bolster the country&#x27;s defense capabilities,

He was one of the main authors of two legislative measures of the Aquino administration, one of which was the Reproductive Health Act. The measure seeks to promote responsible parenthood and to protect the health of the mother and child by giving them access to reproductive health services. President Benigno Aquino III certified the bill as urgent, allowing Congress to pass it quickly. President Aquino signed it into law as Republic Act 10354 in December 2012.

Another legislative measure where Lacson was a main author was the Sin Tax Reform Act, which imposes higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol products to deter the public from buying such products. Those who buy such products will have to pay higher taxes, whose proceeds will go to the government&#x27;s universal health program.

For the Sin Tax Reform Act, Lacson had filed Senate Bill No. 2763, which sought to restructure the excise tax on alcohol products; and Senate Bill No. 2764, which sought to restructure the excise tax on tobacco products. President Aquino signed the bill into law as Republic Act 10351.

Lacson authored Senate Bill No. 2783, which strengthened further the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001. His work is now part of Republic Act No. 10167, which was approved and signed into law on June 18, 2012.

Lacson authored an amendment to the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Act, which aims to provide more funds to the military. President Aquino signed the measure as Republic Act 10349 on December 11, 2012.

Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 2993, An Act Providing for a comprehensive law on firearms, light weapons and ammunitions, which was signed into law as Republic Act 10591.

Lacson authored the law converting Imus, Cavite from a municipality into a city. The measure became Republic Act No. 10161 on May 8, 2012.

Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 2945, which reapportioned the province of Cotabato into three legislative districts. The bill was passed into law as Republic Act 10177.

He filed resolutions that led to many officials being held accountable, whether incumbent or former. Among these were:

*Resolution No. 518: Directing the Blue Ribbon Committee to look into the alleged anomalous acquisition by the Philippine National Police of light operational helicopters in 2009. The resolution triggered an investigation that led to the filing of criminal charges against the officials and personalities linked to the questionable purchase. Some of them were dismissed from the service.
*Resolution No. 519: Directing the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to look into corruption by the previous board of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Many of the officials linked to the irregularity – including former president Gloria Arroyo – have been charged before the graft court.
*Resolution No. 537: Directing the Blue Ribbon Committee to investigate electoral sabotage in the 2004 and 2007 elections, which triggered the charges that led to the arrest and detention of former officials, including former president Gloria Arroyo.

Another resolution, Resolution No. 660, sought congratulate new Cardinal and Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Tagle.

Lacson filed resolutions commending members of the police and military for safeguarding Filipinos, including:
*Resolution No. 542: Resolution honoring The Outstanding Philippine Soldiers (TOPS) of 2011
*Resolution No. 562: Resolution commending the Country&#x27;s Outstanding Policemen in Service (COPS) of 2011

As fiscalizer in the Senate, Lacson initiated the investigation of the following:

*IMPSA investigation – 2002
*Jose Pidal investigation – 2003
*Jueteng investigation – 2005
*Textbook Scam investigation – 2006 – 2007
*Flight of Filipino nurses recruited by Sentosa Recruitment Agency – 2007
*Alleged bribery in the failed impeachment bid against President Arroyo – 2007
*Overpricing in the decorative lampposts used in the Asean summit in Cebu City – 2007
*Irregularities in the multibillion-peso Quedancor swine program – 2008
*Plan by the Social Security System to channel workers&#x27; pension funds into a government economic stimulus program – 2009
*Alleged irregularities in the purchase of video equipment for the Senate&#x27;s Public Relations and Information Bureau – 2009

=== 2004 presidential campaign ===

Lacson ran for President in the 2004 general election against the incumbent president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. His candidacy stirred disagreements with its party president, Senator Edgardo Angara. The COMELEC decided to follow what was done in the Quirino-Avelino case splitting the certificates of votes into half. Angara appealed the case before the Supreme Court and reversed the COMELEC decision. Lacson resigned from the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) upon hearing the news.

After resigning from the LDP, Lacson continued campaigning as an independent candidate in the elections. He finished third with 10.88% of the vote, ahead of former senator Raul Roco and Bro. Eddie Villanueva.

===Aquino cabinet (2013–2015)===
In the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda, that caused widespread destruction, substantial damage and death in several areas in the country, particularly in the Visayas, President Aquino appointed Lacson as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (PARR) with the mandate of unifying the efforts of government and other agencies involved in the rehabilitation and recovery efforts. His office crafted the Yolanda Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan (CRRP) with a PhP167 billion proposed funding, which provides for an overall strategic vision and integrated short-term, medium-term and long-term programs in the Yolanda-affected areas. Lacson&#x27;s efforts in the Yolanda rehabilitation led to the institutionalization of certain mechanisms on rehabilitation of calamity-affected communities.

In December 2014, Lacson tendered his irrevocable resignation as PARR which took effect in February 2015. He recommended the transition of his office&#x27;s accomplishments and best practices to a permanent government agency. Lacson viewed the scheduled sunset review of Republic Act 10121, otherwise known as &quot;Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010&quot;, as an opportune time to propose possible remedial measures that will help improve the effectiveness of the law, especially on the aspect of disaster rehabilitation and recovery.

Lacson pointed out that while his mandate as PARR was to develop a rehabilitation plan, he had no authority to implement or manage funds.

===Third Senate term (2016–2022)===

Lacson originally planned to run for president in the 2016 election. However, due to low ratings in most pre-election presidential surveys, he decided to run for a senate seat as an independent candidate in the 2016 Philippine general election. He was a guest candidate in the senatorial slates of presidential candidates Jejomar Binay (UNA) and Mar Roxas (LP). He was initially listed in Senator Grace Poe&#x27;s senatorial lineup, but he was eventually replaced by Edu Manzano. He was also listed in Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s (PDP–Laban) senatorial slate. However, on February 15, 2016, the Duterte-Cayetano tandem dropped their entire senatorial lineup.

Lacson, who endorsed former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas&#x27; presidential campaign, garnered around 17 million votes in the 2016 elections, earning his way to a Senate seat by ranking fourth in terms of total votes.

In the 17th Congress, Lacson filed Senate Bill 41, the National Reference Act of 2016, which seeks to establish a National ID system that can help government law enforcers deter criminality and terrorism by facilitating the processes of apprehension and prosecution. The system seeks to address the problems of constant delays and inconveniences in availing of basic public services and social security benefits due to inefficient and unreliable means of identifying the beneficiaries. The bill was signed into law as RA 11055 in late 2018.

Lacson filed Senate Bill 42, penalizing a wide range of crimes ranging from drug-related offenses to treason, terrorism, and human trafficking.

Lacson filed Senate Bill 48, which seeks to amend Republic Act 4200 to update the list of crimes where wiretapping may be deemed lawful under certain circumstances. The measure may give law enforcers more teeth against crimes like drugs, money-laundering and coups. On October 19, 2016, Lacson sponsored Senate Bill 1210, the proposed Expanded Anti-Wiretapping Act of 2016.

Other bills filed by Lacson include:

*Senate Bill 258, which offers substantial rewards and better protection to witnesses in exchange for coming out and testifying against government officials or employees involved in corruption.
*Senate Bill 1025, which strips drug pushers, manufacturers, cultivators, importers and financiers of their rights under the Bank Secrecy Act, so they can no longer hide their ill-gotten money in banks.

Lacson filed bills to ensure professionalism among law enforcers, including:

*Senate Bills 255 and 266, which provide added benefits to barangay tanods and captains.
*Senate Bill 260, which provides for special financial assistance for families or beneficiaries of police and military personnel, jail officers and firefighters killed or incapacitated in the line of duty.
*Senate Bill 971, which provides guidelines on the selection of provincial commanders and city and town chiefs of police.
*Senate Bill 1052, which seeks to restore subpoena powers to the PNP&#x27;s CIDG. This was signed into law as RA 10973.
*Senate Bill 1310, which gives the Philippine National Police&#x27;s Internal Affairs Service more teeth to curb abuses and further enhance discipline in the police agency.

He filed bills seeking to streamline or update the operations of government agencies, including:

*Senate Bill 1470, which updates the charter of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office to help it keep up with new variations of lotteries and make it more accountable.
*Senate Bill 1471, which addresses Pagcor&#x27;s &quot;conflicting&quot; roles of regulating and operating gambling casinos by having the agency focus on regulating the industry and giving up its role as operator of such establishments.

However, Lacson went after abusive law enforcers, including some rogue cops who took advantage of the government&#x27;s anti-drug war. At a Senate hearing on January 28, 2017, Lacson showed a video of police officers in civilian clothing, appearing to plant evidence in an anti-drug operation – to stress his call for internal cleansing in the PNP.

In the 18th Congress, Lacson filed Senate Bill 23, the Budget Reform for Village Empowerment Act of 2016. The bill seeks to give local government units an active role in nation building by providing them with funding for development projects.

Lacson re-filed in the 18th Congress his bills on anti-terrorism (Senate Bill 21) and anti-wiretapping (Senate Bill 22). Of the two, the Anti-Terrorism bill became part of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020. Other bills Lacson re-filed included:

*Senate Bill 24, which encourages people&#x27;s participation in deliberations on the national budget to prevent pork.
*Senate Bill 25, which requires registration of prepaid SIM cards to prevent scams and crimes involving identity theft.
*Senate Bill 26, which excludes government employees, including the President, from protection of the Philippine Bank Secrecy Act.
*Senate Bill 27, which reimposes the death penalty on heinous crimes.
*Senate Bill 28, which imposes heavier penalties on false testimonies.
*Senate Bill 29, which assures that parents who enter their twilight years will get support from their children.

*Senate Bill 246, the Real Property Valuation and Assessment Reform Act.
*Senate Bill 247, the Anti-Contraband in Prison Act of 2019.
*Senate Bill 248, Whistleblower Act of 2019.
*Senate Bill 249, The National Defense Act of 2019.
*Senate Bill 250, The Land Administration Reform Act of 2019.
*Senate Bill 251, The Local Government Units&#x27; Income Classification Act of 2019.
*Senate Bill 252, Additional Barangay Captains&#x27; Insurance Act of 2019.

*Senate Bill 254, An Act Establishing the PAF Academy and Appropriating Funds Therefor.
*Senate Bill 255, Exemptions in Requirements for Conversion of a Municipality into a Component City.

===2022 presidential campaign===
On September 8, 2021, Lacson and Tito Sotto launched their bid for president and vice president respectively, for the 2022 Philippine national election. Lacson and Sotto vowed to provide a stronger response to the pandemic, and vowed to restore public trust in the government. Lacson is the first to declare his bid for the presidency.

In late July 2021, Lacson became chairman of Partido Reporma, a political party founded by former Philippine defense secretary Renato de Villa. De Villa was Lacson&#x27;s former superior in the Philippine Constabulary. This was shortly after Lacson and Sotto announced their plans to officially launch their candidacies for the 2022 Philippine presidential election. Sotto is chairman of the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition. On October 6, 2021, Lacson and Sotto filed their certificates of candidacy for president and vice president respectively with the Comelec.

On February 8, 2022, during his proclamation rally in his hometown of Imus, Cavite, Lacson stressed his platform will be based on uplifting the lives of Filipinos by fixing the ills of government and getting rid of thieves, especially those in the government. Lacson said promoting transparency and stopping corruption will be his priority should he be elected. He said he would do this by enforcing discipline in the bureaucracy. Lacson said he will sign a waiver of his rights to the Bank Secrecy Law and encourage all government officials and employees to do the same. Lacson vowed to undertake a massive internal cleansing of the bureaucracy, going first after those with pending cases involving corruption and negligence.

He stressed as well a &quot;Filipino first&quot; policy, granting incentives to local industries for prioritizing local production and labor. The &quot;Filipino first&quot; policy extends to the agriculture sector and food security to protect Filipino farmers and fishermen. Lacson said it is unacceptable that the Philippines imports galunggong (fish) and vegetables that Filipino farmers are producing.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Lacson said he and Sotto will maintain a disciplined campaign amid the pandemic, having their organizers and supporters observe health protocols.

On March 24, 2022, after Partido Reporma switched its endorsement to Leni Robredo, he resigned from the party and became an independent candidate.

=== 2025 senatorial candidacy ===
On September 26, 2024, Lacson was among 12 candidates who President Bongbong Marcos endorsed for the 2025 Senate election, during a political event in Pasay City. Also endorsed were reelectionist senators Imee Marcos, Pia Cayetano, Lito Lapid, Francis Tolentino and Bong Revilla; DILG Secretary Benhur Abalos; Makati Mayor Abby Binay; ACT-CIS Rep. Erwin Tulfo; Las Piñas Rep. Camille Villar; former senators Manny Pacquiao and Tito Sotto.

Lacson pointed out that he is running as an independent, not being a member of any political party. In a statement, he said he is a guest candidate of the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition, one of five major political parties in an alliance with the administration Partido Federal ng Pilipinas. He also made clear that should he win, President Marcos will recognize his &quot;consistent role as a fiscalizer,&quot; guided by their &quot;shared motto&quot; that what is right must be kept right and what is wrong must be set right.

==Political positions==
===Anti-pork advocacy===
In late 2016, Lacson discovered and moved to take out some P8.3 billion in &quot;pork-like&quot; insertions made by the House of Representatives. Lacson noted that House members were allowed to identify P80 million worth of projects before the submission of the 2017 National Expenditure Program to Congress for deliberations – the pork barrel system already declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. This prompted the Senate to realign P8.3 billion in the proposed 2017 national budget to cover tuition of students in state colleges and universities.

For the 2019 budget, Lacson raised questions about the post-ratification tweaks made by the House leadership to the spending bill, saying that this would violate the 1987 Constitution&#x27;s Art. VI, Sec. 26, Paragraph 2: &quot;Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto SHALL be allowed.&quot; He also noted P72.319 billion was slashed from the DPWH&#x27;s MFO 1 and 2, which covers the Duterte administration&#x27;s &quot;Build Build Build&quot; program. The projects under the MFO (Major Final Output) had already been planned and vetted.

Meanwhile, in the proposed 2020 budget, Lacson cited information from some House members regarding a plan to give each district P700 million, and each of 22 deputy Speakers P1.5 billion. The plan was eventually scrapped. Lacson&#x27;s revelations prompted some House members to demand an apology from Lacson, but Lacson said there is nothing to apologize for, as he is guarding the budget. House members demanded that he named his sources, but Lacson refused, saying that he gets more information because he protects his sources. Lacson said that such complaints will not distract him from scrutinizing the 2020 budget bill.

===Capital punishment===
Lacson had been pushing for the restoration of the death penalty, filing a bill seeking to &quot;re-impose the death penalty on certain heinous crimes&quot; in 2019. After he entered the presidential race in the upcoming 2022 presidential election, however, he reversed his decision on the issue after watching the film &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;. As a presidential aspirant, Lacson vowed to retract the death penalty bill he filed before the Senate &quot;if it&#x27;s still there&quot;, arguing that &quot;it is more important to save the life of someone innocent and convicted than to execute someone who is really convicted and proven to have committed a crime&quot;.

===Exposing &quot;Tara (payoffs)&quot; system at the Bureau of Customs===
On August 23, 2017, Lacson delivered a privilege speech at the Senate, where he narrated details of corruption at the Bureau of Customs. This led to Faeldon being cited in contempt by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee after he refused to testify in the probe on illegal drugs.

On September 28, Lacson filed charges against Faeldon and several others before the Office of the Ombudsman over rice smuggling in March 2017.

===Detailing &quot;Conflict of Interest&quot; at the DOH, PhilHealth===
In a privilege speech on July 29, 2019, Lacson detailed how the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) was spending beyond its means while its higher-ups &quot;seem to turn a blind eye.&quot; He said this was due partly to the new reimbursement rates where PhilHealth &quot;pays per case and not by actual expenses.&quot;

Lacson also bared WellMed, a company suspended for making fake benefit claims, was still receiving payments from PhilHealth.

Also, Lacson said the family of Health Secretary and ex-officio PhilHealth chairman Francisco Duque III had entered into a lease agreement with PhilHealth&#x27;s Region 1 office where the agency rented the building owned by the Duque family&#x27;s EMDC in Dagupan City. Lacson said a General Information Sheet of EMDC showed Secretary Duque was among the stockholders of the company, thus indicating a conflict of interest.

In addition, Lacson said Doctors Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company owned by Secretary Duque&#x27;s relatives, bids for government contracts with the DOH. The company was found in 2015 by the Food and Drug Administration to have manufactured for other companies, and was given a cease-and-desist order in June 2015. The FDA also ordered the recall of all drug products, but a tip that prompted an FDA inspection showed the firm was still operating. The FDA also found non-conformance with Good Manufacturing Practice.

The revelations triggered separate investigations by Malacanang and the Senate. Malacanang said that while Secretary Duque, who denied the allegations, still enjoys President Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s trust, it will not stop him from attending the congressional investigations.

===&quot;Designated Survivor&quot; Bill to ensure the order of presidential succession===
On August 28, 2019, Lacson filed Senate Bill 982, an &quot;Act Prescribing the Order of Presidential Succession.&quot; The bill was also known as the &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; bill due to its similarity to the US and Korean shows that featured a designated official being kept in a safe, remote area to act as president should the President and his/her successors be killed or incapacitated in a terrorist attack or major calamity. Lacson confirmed he drew inspiration from the Netflix show.

===Proposed Philippine Building Act===
In the wake of recent quakes that hit Mindanao, Lacson filed Senate Bill 1239, updating the 1977 National Building Code. &quot;Experience tells us that there is an urgent need to strengthen the overall policy on how buildings and structures are built in the country. Not to mention the country&#x27;s geographical location along the boundary of major tectonic plates and at the center of the typhoon belt, coupled by its socially and economically vulnerable population, it becomes even more imperative to review our four-decade-old National Building Code,&quot; Lacson said.

===R&amp;D advocacy===
Lacson pushed for bigger state investments in research and development, which he noted accounts for only 0.4 percent of the national budget from 2016 to 2020. To remedy this, he proposed increases in the R&amp;D budget of the Department of Science and Technology, including a P250M increase for the Office of the Secretary; P50M increase for the Science for Change Program: Niche Center in the Regions for Research and Development (NICER); P100M for the Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation and Advancement (STAMINA4Space); and P100M for the Collaborative Research and Development to Leverage Philippine Economy (CRADLE) program.

He reiterated the importance of research and development in March 2020, amid government preparations to deal with the COVID-19 threat.

Lacson vowed a &quot;historic increase&quot; of budget infusion for research and development efforts should he be elected president.

===Anti-Terrorism Law===
Lacson is one of the authors and the sponsor in the Senate of what is now Republic Act 11479, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 3, 2020. The law replaces the Human Security Act of 2007 (RA 9372), which he noted became a dead-letter law as some of its provisions – including a P500,000 daily penalty for the wrongful detention of a suspected terrorist – discouraged law enforcers from using it to charge suspected terrorists. In more than 10 years in effect, the 2007 law resulted in just one conviction and just one proscribed terrorist organization such as the Abu Sayyaf Group, he added.

The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 fills the gaps in the 2007 law by making punishable inchoate offenses – Section 6 penalizes planning, training, preparing and facilitating the commission of terrorism – as well as providing the mechanism allowing the freezing of assets used to finance terrorism, but does not cover protests, mass actions and other actions covered in the Bill of Rights in the 1987 Constitution.

In addressing claims the law could allow abuse, Lacson said there are safeguards such as 10-year jail terms and perpetual disqualification from public office for law enforcers who fail to comply with the requirement to report the arrest of a suspected terrorist to the nearest court and to the Commission on Human Rights. As such, he pointed out the law is &quot;swift, effective and constitutional&quot;.

==Legislative record==
===Free irrigation law for farmers (Republic Act No. 10969)===
Shortly after assuming his Senate post in 2016, Lacson filed a bill providing free irrigation for farmers. The bill was consolidated in Senate Bill 1465, which along with House Bill 5670 were the basis for Republic Act 10969 – the Free Irrigation Service Act – which President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law on February 2, 2018.

===Anti-hazing law (Republic Act No. 11053)===
Lacson chaired a Senate committee investigation into the fatal hazing of law student Horacio &quot;Atio&quot; Castillo III in September 2017. The probe found indications of a cover-up attempt via Facebook chat by Aegis Jvris fraternity, the organization Castillo sought to join. The probe resulted in Senate Bill 1662, which updated the existing Anti-Hazing Act of 1995 by imposing heavier penalties on hazing. The bill passed third and final reading in the Senate on February 12, 2018. It also passed the bicameral conference committee on February 28, 2018. The bill finally became a law after President Rodrigo Duterte signed it on June 29, 2018.

Under the new law, the definition of hazing was expanded to include &quot;physical or psychological suffering, harm or injury inflicted on a recruit, member, neophyte, or applicant&quot; as a prerequisite for admission or for continued membership in an organization. Banned under the law are &quot;all forms of hazing&quot; not only in fraternities, sororities or organizations in schools, but also those in communities and even businesses and uniformed service learning institutions.

The law also requires schools to be &quot;more active and proactive&quot; in regulating school-based initiation rites, with schools required to exercise reasonable supervision and take proactive steps to protect students from danger of participating in activities that will involve hazing. Penalties include imprisonment of up to 40 years and fines of up to PHP3 million.

===Anti-crime laws===
Lacson filed several anti-crime bills that were passed into law, including:

* Amendment to the Anti-Money Laundering Act to include casinos as covered persons. It was signed into law as Republic Act 10927. Lacson also primarily authored Republic Act 9194, the Anti-Money Laundering Act.

* Restoration of subpoena powers to the PNP-CIDG. The bill was signed into law as Republic Act 10973.

* A retirement and benefits system for the Office of the Ombudsman, which is part of what is now Republic Act 11059.

* Transferring the training of police recruits to the PNP, signed into law as Republic Act 11279.

===National ID law (Republic Act No. 11055)===
Lacson sponsored the bill seeking to establish a National ID system in the Philippines. In his sponsorship speech, Lacson said the National ID system seeks to harmonize, integrate and interconnect the &quot;countless and redundant&quot; government-issued ID cards. The proposed measure – Senate Bill 1738 – was approved in the Senate with a vote of 17–2 on March 19, 2018.

On August 6, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the National ID measure into law, as Republic Act 11055. Lacson, the principal sponsor of the measure and a perennial author since 2001, expressed thanks to Duterte, as it was under his term that the national ID system saw the light of day.

===PNP rank classification law (Republic Act 11200)===
On February 8, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act 11200, which provides for a rank classification in the Philippine National Police. Lacson said the new law, where he is the principal author and sponsor, eliminates confusion on how PNP officers must be addressed, but more importantly, &quot;allows for better coordination between the PNP and other law enforcement units in countering terrorism and other threats to national security.&quot; He added: &quot;We cannot afford any delay in coordination in counter-terrorism operations and operations against other threats to national security.&quot;

Under the new law, the PNP&#x27;s rank classification shall be as follows:
*Director-General to Police General
*Deputy Director-General to Police Lieutenant General
*Director to Police Major General
*Chief Superintendent to Police Brigadier General
*Senior Superintendent to Police Colonel
*Superintendent to Police Lieutenant Colonel
*Chief Inspector to Police Major
*Senior Inspector to Police Captain
*Inspector to Police Lieutenant
*SPO4 to Police Executive Master Sergeant
*SPO3 to Police Chief Master Sergeant
*SPO2 to Police Senior Master Sergeant
*SPO1 to Police Master Sergeant
*PO3 to Police Staff Sergeant
*PO2 to Police Corporal
*PO1 to Patrolman/Patrolwoman

===Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act No. 11479)===
Lacson sponsored in the Senate what is now the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act No. 11479). In his sponsorship speech for the measure in October 2019, Lacson said the country needs &quot;a legal framework for anti-terrorism that is clear, concise, balanced, and rational.&quot; He added the 2007 Human Security Act – which the 2020 anti-terror law replaced – had become a dead-letter law, with only one conviction in the more than 10 years it was in effect.

Also, Lacson pointed out the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 fills the gaps in the 2007 law by making punishable inchoate offenses – Section 6 penalizes planning, training, preparing and facilitating the commission of terrorism – as well as providing the mechanism allowing the freezing of assets used to finance terrorism.

However, he stressed the law is not meant to stifle dissent as claimed by some groups, as Section 4 makes clear it does not cover advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights that are not intended to cause death or serious physical harm to a person, to endanger a person&#x27;s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety. Lacson said he is ready to closely monitor and call out potential abuses in the implementation of the law, adding he will not allow anyone to pervert the legislative intent of the measure that he had painstakingly sponsored on the Senate floor.

He noted the bill had gone through the gauntlet in the legislative branch, with its provisions earning the nod of constitutionalists and legal heavyweights in both houses of Congress.

On September 2, 2022, Lacson reiterated that the CPP-NPA-NDF, which was designated not only by the government of the Republic of the Philippines but also by the European Union, the United States of America and four other countries (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand) — &quot;is unequivocally an enemy of the state.&quot; He also scored suggestions to amend the Anti-Terrorism Act, saying this would be &quot;a disrespect to our comrades-in-arms as well as the countless civilians who fell victims to the atrocities of this terrorist group that has lost its ideological principles over the years – they murder, they rob, they extort, they harass and intimidate and worse, indiscriminately.&quot;

===Easing conversion of municipalities into cities (Republic Act 11683)===
Lacson filed Senate Bill 255 in July 2019, seeking to ease the requirements for municipalities to become cities. The measure lapsed into law in April 2022 as Republic Act 11683. The law amends Section 450 of RA 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, exempting a municipality from the land and population requirements if it generates at least P100 million for two consecutive years.

===Law ending revolving-door policy in the AFP (Republic Act 11705)===
Lacson co-authored and sponsored Senate Bill 2376, which President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law as Republic Act 11709. The law provides fixed terms for the AFP Chief of Staff and other senior officers, among others, to ensure professionalism in the institution. Lacson was the principal author and sponsor of Senate Bill 2869 in the 15th Congress, which also sought to provide fixed terms for the AFP&#x27;s chief of staff and major service commanders. However, it was vetoed by then President Benigno Aquino III at the time.

&quot;Finally, we will see an end to the revolving-door policy in the AFP. The leaders of our AFP will have the opportunity to implement their legacy programs instead of staying in office too briefly,&quot; said Lacson, adding that &quot;(t)he revolving-door policy has always been a disservice to the mandates of the military leadership entrusted with the security and defense of the country.&quot;

===Other laws===
Lacson also primarily authored:

*Republic Act No. 9163, The National Service Training Program (NSTP) Act of 2001
*Republic Act No. 9166, An Act Increasing the Base Pay of the members of the AFP
*Republic Act No. 9208, The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003
*Republic Act No. 9416, Anti-Cheating Act of 2007
*Republic Act No. 9484, The Philippine Dental Act of 2007
*Republic Act No. 9485, Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007

He was also one of the co-authors of the following laws:
*Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
*Republic Act No. 9189, otherwise known as the Absentee Voting Act
*Republic Act No. 9287, otherwise known as the Anti-Jueteng and Illegal Numbers Game
*Republic Act No. 9406, An Act Reorganizing the Public Attorney&#x27;s Office
*Republic Act No. 11691, An Act Creating the Office of the Judiciary Marshals

==Helping in food security==
After his Senate term ended at noon of June 30, 2022, Lacson said he would retire but continue to help in food security through an agri-aqua venture. He said this new chapter in his life involves seeking to boost Philippine agriculture by planting the protein-rich sorghum while engaging in small-scale feed mills, hatcheries and fish cage farming in Mindanao and Luzon. Through this, he said they hope to contribute to help make the Philippines food-sufficient while providing Filipino farmers with additional income outside the traditional rice planting season.

==Personal life==
Lacson is married to Alice de Perio and he had 4 children including his son Panfilo &quot;Pampi&quot; Lacson Jr., who has a son with actress and former wife Jodi Sta. Maria, and a daughter with partner Iwa Moto.

His success story in law enforcement inspired a movie titled &quot;Ping Lacson: Super Cop&quot; in 2000. He was portrayed by action star Rudy Fernandez.

Another film, &quot;10,000 Hours&quot;, in 2013, was based on Lacson&#x27;s flight in 2010. It starred Robin Padilla, who was elected senator in 2022.

<doc id="556682" wikidata="Q2184714" url="?curid=556682" title="Raul Roco">
<text>Raul Sagarbarria Roco (October 26, 1941 – August 5, 2005) was a Filipino politician. He was the founder and presidential nominee of &quot;Aksyon Demokratiko&quot;, which he founded in 1997 as a vehicle for his presidential bid in 1998 and his second one in 2004. He was a former constitutional delegate, congressman, senator and Secretary of Education under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

He had a strong following among young voters in the Philippines due to his efforts to promote honesty and good governance.

==Early life and education==

Raul Roco was born in Naga in the Philippine province of Camarines Sur, the son of farmer Sulpicio Azuela Roco and public school teacher Rosario Orlanda Sagarbarria.

Roco finished elementary school at age 10 from Naga Parochial School, and high school at age 14 from Ateneo de Naga. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from San Beda College (now San Beda University) in Manila with a degree in English in 1960. Then, he was also the Editor-in-Chief of The Bedan working with the likes of Rene Saguisag and Jaime Licauco. Later, Roco received a Bachelor of Laws degree (also at San Beda College) and was the college&#x27;s Abbott Awardee for Over-All Excellence. In the United States, he obtained his Master of Laws at the University of Pennsylvania, while also cross-enrolled at Wharton School where he took up multinational studies. Roco also wrote the official school lyrics, &quot;The Bedan Hymn&quot; as a student. Fr. Benildus Maramba OSB collaborated and composed the hymn.

He was the president of the National Union of Students of the Philippines in 1961 and was named one of the Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines in 1964. His wife Sonia was the Most Outstanding Student that same year.

As a result of his various other achievements, he had been awarded seven honorary doctorates.

==Political/professional career==

After he passed the bar in 1965, Roco lobbied for the holding of a Constitutional Convention that aimed to amend the 1935 Philippine Constitution. He campaigned for a seat to represent his district in Camarines Sur. He won and thus became convention&#x27;s youngest Bicolano delegate.

He became one the legal staff of the late Philippine Senator Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino, and he drafted the Study Now, Pay Later law.

From 1983 to 1985, he served as president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. Under his term, he questioned Ferdinand Marcos presidential decrees.

Alongside his work in law, he has also served as a film producer. In 1974, he was the executive producer of the late film director Lino Brocka&#x27;s movie &quot;Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang&quot;; this film won six FAMAS awards that year, including best film.

Among all legislators of the Eighth Congress of the Philippines (which lasted from 1987 to 1992), he was adjudged by the Ford Foundation and the University of the Philippines Institute of Strategic and Development Studies as first in over-all performance.

===Senate===
Roco was elected to the Senate in 1992 and 1995 serving until 2001, making many contributions that led many to recognize him as an &quot;outstanding senator&quot;. He wrote the law which reformed the nation&#x27;s banking system; this earned him the title &quot;Father of the Bangko Sentral&quot;. Some other laws that he wrote resulted in the liberalization of the banking industry and the strengthening of the thrift banks. In addition, he wrote the Intellectual Property Code and the Securities Regulation Code.

Roco has also made several contributions to education in the Philippines. He helped fund the teachers&#x27; cooperatives as well as the increment mandated by the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers for retiring public school teachers. On the students&#x27; side, he helped bring computers into Philippine universities, colleges, and public schools. In addition, he devised a plan for meal scholarships for poor students at the Philippine Normal University.

Roco wrote several bills targeted at protecting and prioritizing women in the Philippines. He wrote the Women in Nation Building Law, the Nursing Act, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, the Anti-Rape Law, and the Child and Family Courts Act. He also let women play major roles in the Department of Education&#x27;s literacy program. Out of thanks to his services for women, many women&#x27;s groups named him an &quot;Honorary Woman&quot;.

He also drafted a bill that abolished double taxation on Filipinos working abroad.

He was given the Bantay Katarungan award by Kilosbayan for playing an integral role in the Senate impeachment trial of then-president Joseph Estrada who was impeached by the House of Representatives on 2000 for graft and corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust, and culpable violation of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Unfortunately, the impeachment trial was not concluded and in 2001, Estrada was ousted from power by another People Power uprising.

===As Secretary of Education===
Roco took over as education secretary of the Philippines in 2001, at a time when the Philippines had not only one of the ten most corrupt governments in the world (according to Transparency International), but its Department of Education was also the fourth-most corrupt of its agencies (as named by the Asia Foundation - Social Weather Stations Survey of Enterprises on Public Sector Corruption). To combat this corruption, Roco imposed a department-wide transparency policy which also held employees accountable for the purchase of textbooks, which had been a major source of the department&#x27;s corruption. This allowed the department to purchase textbooks for a much lower price, and after just eight months under Roco&#x27;s leadership, the Department of Education gained a 73% public approval rating and became the most trusted government agency in the Philippines.

During his tenure in that position, Roco allowed free public education (through high school) as required by the Philippine Constitution. He also enacted a reform of basic education curriculum in order that children would focus their studies on reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and Makabayan. In addition, he made sure that teachers were paid promptly and ended the 3% &quot;service fee&quot; that the department had long been deducting from teachers&#x27; pay.

==Candidacy for President==
===1998===

Roco ran for president in the 1998 Philippine election. He lost to Vice-President Joseph Estrada but had a remarkable showing in a field of eleven candidates despite being an independent candidate. His strong showing was attributed to the widespread support he received from young Filipinos who eventually formed his party, Aksyon Demokratiko, and its youth arm, Aksyon Kabataan. Party leaders then included Jaime Galvez Tan, Lorna Patajo-Kapunan and Darwin Mariano. 

===2004===

Roco rode his success in the Department of Education into a run for the Philippine presidency in 2004. His candidacy was based on his ability to fight corruption and to display fair play, decency, and honor. His Aksyon Demokratiko party formed a coalition with Promdi and Reporma, the parties of 1998 presidential candidates Lito Osmeña and Rene de Villa, to form the &quot;Alyansa ng Pag-asa&quot; (Alliance of Hope).

Roco was a front-runner in pre-election surveys and was considered a strong contender. However, during the campaign, he battled with recurrence of his cancer, after remission from his bout with prostate cancer in 1996. His illness forced him to leave the campaign trail for medical attention in the United States. Doctors told him that his condition was not life-threatening and that he could continue his run for the presidency. He returned to the campaign trail, but concerns about his illness greatly diminished his support.

He lost the election to the incumbent, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and finished fourth in a field of 5 candidates.

He was the President of Aksyon Demokratiko until his death.

== Personal life ==
Roco was married to Sonia Cubillo Malasarte from Bohol. They have six children (Robbie Pierre, Raul Jr., Sophia, Sareena, Rex and Synara). 

==Death==

On August 5, 2005, Raul Roco died of prostate cancer, at St Luke&#x27;s Medical Center in Quezon City. He was buried in Naga, Camarines Sur. 

His widow, Sonia, ran for being a Senator under the Genuine Opposition (formerly United Opposition) umbrella in the May 14, 2007 midterm elections and 2010 Philippine presidential election but lost. She still represents the party he started, Aksyon Demokratiko, hoping to continue the advocacies that her late husband had started.

<doc id="556689" wikidata="Q5039632" url="?curid=556689" title="Caringbah">
<text>Caringbah is a suburb in Southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Caringbah is south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Sutherland Shire.

Caringbah once stretched from Woolooware Bay on the Georges River to Yowie Bay and Burraneer Bay on the Port Hacking estuary. A number of Caringbah localities have been declared as separate suburbs but still share the postcode 2229. These suburbs include Taren Point to the north on the Georges River, and Port Hacking, Lilli Pilli, Dolans Bay and Caringbah South, located on the Port Hacking River to the south.

==History==

 is an Aboriginal word from the Kumbainggar language for &quot;a pademelon wallaby&quot;. The suburb was originally called Highfield, but it is unclear whether this was a position description or whether it was named after an early resident. Caringbah was used from 1911, after the steam trams began operating between Cronulla and Sutherland.

Thomas Holt (1811–88) owned most of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla in the 1860s. Most of the area around Miranda and Caringbah was used for market gardening from the 1880s. Caringbah was still used for orchards and farming until after World War II. The railway line to Cronulla opened in 1939.

==Commercial area==
Caringbah features a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial areas. The commercial district is made up mostly of small businesses specialising in professional services. A large commercial and industrial area is also centred on Taren Point Road and surrounding areas. Commercial developments here include many home furnishing retailers such as Nick Scali Furniture, large retailers including Bunnings, as well as home renovation showrooms.

The main shopping centre is located close to Caringbah railway station and is centred on the intersections of President Avenue, The Kingsway and Port Hacking Road South. A small group of shops, known as Caringbah South, is located further south on Port Hacking Road South. Caringbah Library is located on Port Hacking Road South. Another small group of shops is located even further south, close to the border of Lilli Pilli. Caringbah is home to the public district Sutherland Hospital adjacent to Caringbah Ambulance Station and Kareena Private Hospital on Kareena Road.

==Transport==
Caringbah is a central suburb of the Sutherland Shire, considering some of the main roads intersect here. President Avenue and The Kingsway both run from Sutherland via Miranda in the west, to the popular beachside suburb of Cronulla in the east.

<doc id="556691" wikidata="Q6589983" url="?curid=556691" title="List of Metro-North Railroad stations">
<text>The Metro-North Railroad is a commuter rail system serving two of the five boroughs of New York City (Manhattan and the Bronx), Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, and Orange Counties in New York, as well Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut. It was established by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1983 to acquire operation of all commuter rail service in New York and Connecticut from Conrail, which itself had been formed in 1976 through the merging of a number of financially troubled railroads, and previously operated commuter railroad service under contract from the MTA.

==Station origins==

As with many commuter railroad systems of the late-20th Century in the United States, the stations exist along lines that were inherited from other railroads of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Stations on the east side of the Hudson River were originally part of either New York Central Railroad or New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, both of which became part of Penn Central in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Stations on lines on the west side of the Hudson River were originally part of Erie Railroad, which was merged into the Erie Lackawanna Railroad in 1960.

==Historical preservation of stations==
Dozens of active stations that serve Metro-North are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the most notable of which is Grand Central Terminal, which is also a National Historic Landmark and a New York City Landmark. The majority of protected stations are on the New Haven Line, including two of the three branches. Four of the northern termini of each line contains stations that are on NRHP, but the only one that serves Metro-North trains is Poughkeepsie station. The New Haven Line has been terminating northeast of the historic New Haven Union Station at State Street station since 2002. The Danbury Branch, Waterbury Branch, and Port Jervis Line stop at platforms just short of former stations that are listed on NRHP.

Some stations, such as , are contributing properties to historic districts on NRHP. Other structures related to the railroad are listed on NRHP, but are not stations, such as the Housatonic River, Norwalk River, and Saugatuck River Railroad Bridges.

==Station list==
This is a list of train stations served by Metro-North Railroad. This includes stations shared with NJ Transit, but only those within New York State. Stations are listed in alphabetical order. Stations along the Pascack Valley Line from Hoboken, NJ to Montvale, NJ and along the Main Line and Bergen County Line from Hoboken, NJ to Mahwah, NJ are operated solely by NJ Transit.

==Former stations==
This list only includes stations that were closed by Metro-North after the railroad&#x27;s formation in 1983. It does not include stations closed by the New York Central Railroad, Penn Central Railroad, New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, Erie Railroad, Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, or Conrail, or the MTA pre-1983.

==Proposed stations==
==Divisions no longer in service==
* Putnam Division (New York and Putnam Railroad)
* Beacon Division (Beacon Line)
* Upper Harlem Division (New York Central Railroad)

<doc id="556693" wikidata="Q1092910" url="?curid=556693" title="Circular Quay">
<text>Circular Quay is a harbour, former working port and now international passenger shipping terminal, public piazza and tourism precinct, heritage area, and transport node located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, on the northern edge of the Sydney central business district on Sydney Cove, between Bennelong Point and The Rocks. It is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney.

The Circular Quay area is a popular neighbourhood for tourism and consists of walkways, pedestrian malls, parks and restaurants. It hosts a number of ferry wharves, bus stops, and a railway station. Often referred to as the &quot;gateway to Sydney&quot;, the precinct has views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House and is a common location for viewing Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks.

==History==
===Indigenous history===

The Aboriginal name for Circular Quay is &quot;Warrung&quot;, meaning &quot;Little Child&quot;.

The first people to occupy the area now known as Sydney were Aboriginal Australians. Radiocarbon dating suggests that they lived in and around Sydney for at least 30,000 years. In an archaeological dig in Parramatta, Western Sydney, it was found that the Aboriginals used charcoal, stone tools and possibly ancient campfires. Near Penrith, a far western suburb of Sydney, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45,000 to 50,000 years BP.

Prior to the arrival of the British there were 4,000 to 8,000 native people in the Sydney area from as many as 29 different clans. Sydney Cove from Port Jackson to Petersham was inhabited by the Cadigal clan. The principal language groups were Darug, Guringai, and Dharawal. The earliest Europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing, using trees for bark and food, collecting shells, and cooking fish. The Eora are the coastal Aboriginals of the Sydney district. The name &quot;Eora&quot; simply means &quot;here&quot; or &quot;from this place&quot;, and was used by local Aboriginals to describe to the British where they came from. The Cadigal band are the traditional inhabitants of the Sydney CBD area, and their territory south of Port Jackson stretched from South Head to Petersham.

===Colonial settlement===

Sydney Cove, on which Circular Quay is located, was the site of the initial landing of the First Fleet in Port Jackson on 26 January 1788.

The governor&#x27;s temporary canvas house was erected on the east side of the cove, while the western shore became the centre of the early settlement. It was the focal point from which the city of Sydney grew. The first wharf on the shore of Sydney Cove probably dated from around 1792. In 1802 it was replaced with a timber-framed wharf called &quot;Hospital Wharf&quot;, the first public wharf of the colony (later renamed King&#x27;s Wharf and Queen&#x27;s Wharf).

Late 18th-century Scottish constitutional reformer Thomas Muir was sentenced to transportation to Sydney for sedition, and had a cottage on what is now Circular Quay. Thomas Muir escaped from the colony in 1796 aboard an American brig, the &quot;Otter&quot;.

The eastern side of the cove remained largely uninhabited in the early years of the colony; one notable inhabitant was Bennelong, after whom the adjacent Bennelong Point and Bennelong Apartments are named. In the early 19th century, the entire eastern shore of Circular Quay was part of the Governor&#x27;s Domain, though some commercial activity developed along the shoreline. The western shore, being adjacent to the original settlement now known as The Rocks, was busier. Cadman&#x27;s Cottage is a building which survives from that era, built in 1816 for the use of the governmental coxswains and their crews, it marks approximately the location of Circular Quay&#x27;s natural western shore, prior to reconstruction. The Commissariat Stores (built in 1809) and Australia&#x27;s first naval dock were also located on the western shore. The naval dockyard was expanded in 1818–1822 under Governor Macquarie, with four repairing docks.

===Working port===

Circular Quay was constructed in 1837–1844 by reconstructing the southern section of Sydney Cove with an artificial shoreline. The mouth of the Tank Stream, which flowed into Sydney Cove at the western end of Circular Quay, was in-filled. The harbour was originally known as &quot;Semi-Circular Quay&quot;, this being the actual shape of the quay. The name was shortened for convenience. Wharves were built on the southern shore. Reflecting Circular Quay&#x27;s status as the central harbour for Sydney, the Customs House was built on the southern shore in 1844–1845. During the construction of Circular Quay, the eastern side of the cove was used as a quarry and housed construction works. After the governor&#x27;s residence was moved up the hill to the present Government House in the 1840s and 1850s, Macquarie Street was extended north through the Governor&#x27;s Domain to Fort Macquarie. This led to the development of the area between the street and the shore into a commercial working wharf dominated by the wool trade, while the eastern side of the street remained part of the Domain. This part of Macquarie Street became known as the &quot;wool store&quot; end. Wool and bond stores and warehouses appeared on the site. The historic &quot;Moore Steps&quot; was built in 1868 as a passage between two wool stores, leading from the shore to Macquarie Street. By the 1860s, all three sides of Circular Quay were dominated by wharves and warehouses.

However, by the 1870s, much of the commercial shipping activities was moving away from Circular Quay. The harbour was becoming too small to accommodate the increasing number of large ships accessing Sydney. Instead, shipping activities moved further westwards to Darling Harbour, which also had the advantage of a railway line.

With the absence of commercial shipping, the harbour became increasingly used for passenger transport. The first ferry wharf was built on the southern shore in 1879. From the 1890s, ferry terminals came to dominate the harbour, and Circular Quay became the hub of the Sydney ferry network. The Sydney Harbour Trust was formed in 1900.

===Transport developments===

Circular Quay was also a tram hub. It was the focal terminal point of most electric tram services to the Eastern Suburbs. The first tram to operate through Circular Quay was horse-drawn, running from the old Sydney Railway station to Circular Quay along Pitt Street in 1861 allowing easy transfer to ferries. Trams operated from Central station down Castlereagh Street to Circular Quay and back up Pitt Street in a large anti-clockwise loop. For many years, 27 regular services operated from Circular Quay.

From 1936, the appearance of Circular Quay was dramatically changed with the construction of a railway viaduct, and later the elevated Cahill Expressway above the viaduct, across the southern shore of the cove. Circular Quay railway station was opened on 20 January 1956 and the elevated Cahill Expressway was officially opened on 24 March 1958.

===Building developments===

The construction of the viaduct led to the demolition of the old Maritime Services Board building on the south-western shore. A replacement was constructed further north in 1940, and is today the Museum of Contemporary Art. Further north, the Sydney Cove Passenger Terminal was built in 1958–1960 to accommodate the increasing number of passengers arriving by ship. The building was renovated in 1988, 2000 and 2014. Large liners and cruise ships often dock here, their size dominating the cove. East Circular Quay was redeveloped from the 1950s with the replacement of wool stores with modernist commercial buildings. The Sydney height limit was increased from in 1959, and a number of Sydney&#x27;s first skyscrapers were built around Circular Quay. The AMP Building on the southern shore was Sydney&#x27;s tallest building when completed in 1962. In 1973, the Sydney Opera House was completed at the northeastern end of Sydney Cove.

Between 1971 and 1989, Colonial Mutual Life acquired land along Circular Quay for a large scale development. The initial design caused significant controversy around the country, including intervention by the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and internationally. A revised 1992 design had the developer reducing building height and providing a colonnade for public access, in exchange for the development extending further towards the foreshore. The resulting development of Bennelong Apartments (nicknamed by critics as &quot;The Toaster&quot;), and is criticised for it positioning and for obscuring views of the Sydney Opera House, from the main pedestrian approach.

In 2019, several property developments underway by the private sector in the area, including: Quay Quarter Sydney by AMP Capital, Opera Residences, One Circular Quay by Yuhu Group, Circular Quay Tower by Lendlease, and the Sandstone Hotels precinct by Pontiac Group. In addition, the Sydney Opera House is undergoing its largest renewal project since its opening.

==Transport==


Circular Quay is a major Sydney transport hub, with a large ferry, rail and bus interchange. The Cahill Expressway is a prominent feature of the quay, running from the east, over the elevated railway station to join the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the west. International ships have docked and moored at Circular Quay since the earliest years of the colony. The Overseas Passenger Terminal is a major piece of Sydney transport infrastructure serving cruise ships and ocean liners and their passengers.

Circular Quay railway station is the only station on the City Circle that is above ground. The platform looks out over the ferry terminus, providing views of Sydney Harbour, including the bridge and Opera House.

The wharf complex hosts five commuter ferry wharves and is the terminus for all public ferry routes in Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River other than the Mortlake Ferry between Mortlake and Putney.
Circular Quay was formerly a large tram terminus and interchange. As many Sydney bus routes follow the previous tram lines, the tram terminus in Alfred Street became a major bus terminus for many bus routes. In March 1995, the road on the eastern side of Circular Quay which served as a bus layover was closed and converted into a pedestrian zone. A redesign of CBD bus services in October 2015 reduced the number of bus routes serving Circular Quay. In 2019, the CBD and South East Light Rail to Kingsford and Randwick opened with a terminus in Alfred Street.

==Culture==

Circular Quay is a focal point for community celebrations, due to its central Sydney location between the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is one of the main congregation points for Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Circular Quay is also the home of Sydney&#x27;s Museum of Contemporary Art and the City of Sydney Library in the heritage-listed Customs House. Sydney Writers Walk a series of plaques commemorating writers with some connection to Sydney was installed in the footpath along Circular Quay in 1991. In autumn 2006, the largest open-air art exhibition ever in Australia took place on Circular Quay: Over 7 weeks the Berlin Buddy Bears visited Sydney. Each bear represented a member-country of the United Nations, symbolizing the universal principles of peace, freedom and friendship.

The Quay is mentioned in the classic song &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; (1971) by Eric Bogle. &quot;Circular Quay&quot; is the title of a song from Dr. Robert of The Blow Monkeys which appeared on his 1994 debut solo album, &quot;Realms of Gold&quot;. The song was also issued as a single in the same year.

Water Polo by the Sea is held there every year by Australian Water Polo with the Australia men&#x27;s national water polo team take on the International All Stars.

<doc id="556694" wikidata="Q286462" url="?curid=556694" title="Thomas Graves (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Admiral Sir Thomas Graves KB (c.1747 – 29 March 1814) was an officer of the Royal Navy who rose to the rank of admiral after service in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

==Family and early life==
Thomas Graves was born circa 1747, the third son of Reverend John Graves of Castle Dawson, County Londonderry, by his wife Jane Hudson. He was a nephew of Admiral Samuel Graves and a first cousin once removed of Admiral Thomas, Lord Graves. Graves&#x27; three brothers all served as captains in the navy, becoming admirals on the superannuated list. Thomas entered the navy at a very early age, and served during the Seven Years&#x27; War with his uncle Samuel on board , &quot;Duke&quot;, and . After the peace he was appointed to with his cousin Thomas, whom he followed to , and by whom, in 1765, while on the coast of Africa, he was promoted to be lieutenant of . It is stated in Foster&#x27;s &quot;Peerage&quot; that he was born in 1752, a date incompatible with the facts of his known service: by the Regulations of the Navy he was bound to be twenty years old at the date of his promotion, and though the order was often grossly infringed, it is highly improbable that he was only thirteen: it may fairly be assumed that he was at least eighteen in 1765.

==Arctic seas and North America==
In 1770 Graves was lieutenant of , and in 1773 was appointed to with Captain Constantine Phipps for the voyage of discovery in the Arctic Seas.
In the following year he went out to North America with his uncle Samuel, and was appointed by him to command , one of the small schooners employed for the prevention of smuggling. She had thirty men, with an armament of four 2-pounder guns, and on 27 May 1775, being sent from Boston into the Charles River, was attacked by a large force of insurgents, whose numbers swelled till they reached a total of something like two thousand men, with two field-pieces. It fell calm, and towards midnight, as the tide ebbed, &quot;Diana&quot; ran aground, and lay over on her side, when the colonial forces succeeded in setting her on fire, and the small crew, after a gallant defence, were compelled to abandon her, Graves having been first severely burnt, as well as his brother John, then a lieutenant of the flagship , who had been sent in one of the &quot;Preston&quot;″s boats to support &quot;Diana&quot;. 

==Promotion and further service==
After this Graves continued to be employed in command of other tenders in the neighbourhood of Boston and Rhode Island until, on the recall of his uncle, he rejoined &quot;Preston&quot; and returned to England; but was again sent out to the North American station in the same ship, commanded by Commodore William Hotham. In 1779 he was promoted to the command of the sloop on the West Indian and North American stations, and in May 1781 he was advanced to post rank. In the temporary absence of Commodore Edmund Affleck, he commanded in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September, and continuing afterwards in &quot;Bedford&quot;, as Affleck&#x27;s flag captain, was present in the engagement at St. Kitts on 26 January 1782, and in the Battle of the Saintes on 9 and 12 April, in which last &quot;Bedford&quot; had a very distinguished part.

In the following autumn Graves was appointed to the frigate HMS &quot;Magicienne&quot;, in which, on 2 January 1783, he fought a very severe action with the French , which was encumbered with a second ship&#x27;s company which she was carrying to the Chesapeake. Both frigates were reduced to a wreck, and so parted; &quot;Magicienne&quot; to get to Jamaica a fortnight later; &quot;Sybille&quot; to be captured on 22 January 1783 by &quot;Hussar&quot; under Thomas McNamara Russell.

==Years of peace and the French Revolutionary Wars==
During the peace Graves spent much of his time in France, and in the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars had no employment. It was not until October 1800 that he was appointed to command the 74-gun , in the Channel Fleet, under the orders of Lord St. Vincent. This was only for a few months; for on 1 January 1801 he was promoted to be Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron, and in March hoisted his flag on board the 64-gun , one of the fleet proceeding to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker.

==Flag rank and later life==
Graves afterwards shifted his flag to , and in her was third in command under Parker and Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. For his services on this important occasion he received the thanks of Parliament, and an appointment as Knight Commander of the Bath. Towards the end of July the fleet left the Baltic, and on its return to England Graves, who had been in very bad health during the greater part of the campaign, retired from active service. , captained for a time by Christopher Nesham, carried his flag in the Bay of Biscay from October 1804 to February 1805. He became a vice-admiral on 9 November 1805 and admiral on 2 August 1812.

==Personal life==
He was twice married, but had only one daughter. He died at his house, Woodbine Hill, near Honiton on 29 March 1814.

<text>Poughkeepsie station is a Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak stop serving the city of Poughkeepsie, New York. The station is the northern terminus of Metro-North&#x27;s Hudson Line, and an intermediate stop for Amtrak&#x27;s several Empire Corridor trains.

Built in 1918, the main station building is meant to be a much smaller version of Grand Central Terminal. It was a source of civic pride when it opened. In 1976 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Poughkeepsie Railroad Station; it and Philipse Manor are the only Hudson Line stations outside Manhattan to be so recognized.

==Station layout==

The station is a four-story building built into a rockface, with the bottom two levels given over to the tracks and the top two accounted for by the main waiting room, a two-story brick-faced building. Its five-bay facade features sculptured masonry designs over the five high arched windows. To the west, a 420x15-foot (128x5 m) steel-frame overhead walkway provides access to the tracks via stairs and elevators. Today it continues westward to provide access to the adjacent parking garage. At the time of the station&#x27;s construction, it served the businesses along Main Street.

The waiting room, modeled on Grand Central Terminal, is a high gallery lit during daylight by the windows and the three original chandeliers. The 14 benches within are also original finished chestnut pieces. The walls are paneled in wood to eight feet (240 cm), after which the carved stone shows all the way to the cornice. More original woodwork, the stained walnut rafters, is present in the ceiling, possibly modeled after a similar design in San Miniato al Monte, an 11th-century church in Florence, Italy.

Amenities include bathrooms (also modernized), a concession stand, as well as a ticket counter selling Metro-North tickets alongside two vending machines which also sell MetroCards. There is no checked baggage service for Amtrak trains; Amtrak tickets are available only via a Quik-Trak kiosk. The northernmost MTA Police substation is adjacent to the station as well. In the late 1960s the North-South Arterial (US 9) was built and elevated immediately to the station&#x27;s east, somewhat isolating it from the rest of the city.

There are four tracks at the platform level, enough to accommodate Amtrak and Metro-North stops simultaneously, and from west to east numbered 2, 1, 3, and 5. Only tracks 2, 1, and 3 are regularly used. Track 5, the easternmost, has a lower speed limit and is used mainly for non-revenue maintenance trains or those experiencing difficulties. The station has a high-level island platform, high level side platform, and a low level side platform, each six cars long and slightly offset from each other. Only the high level platforms are used in passenger service.
==History==
The first Poughkeepsie station was built in 1850 as what became the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s Water Level Route worked its way up the Hudson River. For its first two years it was the end of the line, but even after it was completed all the way to Albany, it remained the most important intermediate stop. Many local industries, particularly the carpet mills and shoe factories in the city, used the rail facilities to get their products to market. The concentration of industry around a major rail stop also led to the rise of banking and finance within the city as well.

In 1889, with the completion of the nearby Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge providing east-west rail service across the Hudson, Poughkeepsie became even more important to regional rail transportation. When it came time for a third station to be built on the site, the firm of Warren &amp; Wetmore was hired to design a station that would impress travelers and communicate the city&#x27;s confidence and cosmopolitan aspirations. They chose to model it on Grand Central, another successful design of theirs.

After five years of design and construction, the station was opened on February 18, 1918. The city&#x27;s main newspaper, then the &quot;Poughkeepsie Eagle&quot; (now the &quot;Poughkeepsie Journal&quot;) was unstinting in its praise:
The building has remained largely intact since then, despite declines in passenger rail use and the demise of the New York Central. It has since transitioned, under the auspices of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, from being a station for primarily intercity rail to the commuter services of Metro-North. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Until April 4, 2009, the southbound Lake Shore Limited (Train 48) stopped at the station, as well as at Hudson, and stations. On November 8, 2010, Lake Shore Limited service to the station was restored in both directions, and later at Rhinecliff, but not at Hudson.

A massive restoration in the late 20th century included the reconstruction of the overpass from the station to Main Street and a large parking garage to serve commuters (many of whom come from points north and west). Since the 1990s, there have been rumors and plans to expand the Hudson Line north to Rhinecliff (or even further to Rensselaer). Local property owners have objected to the given plans to build stations in Hyde Park and Staatsburg though those who do commute via Poughkeepsie are in favor of the plan.

The &quot;Berkshire Flyer&quot; began running on July 8, 2022, providing direct service to on summer weekends.

<doc id="556696" wikidata="Q1226763" url="?curid=556696" title="Diocesan Boys' School">
<text>The Diocesan Boys&#x27; School (DBS) is a day and boarding Anglican boys&#x27; school in Hong Kong, located at 131 Argyle Street, Mong Kok, Kowloon. The school&#x27;s mission is &quot;to provide a liberal education based on Christian principles&quot;. Having run as a grant-aided school since it was founded, the school commenced operation in the Direct Subsidy Scheme in September 2003. It uses English as the medium of instruction. Its current headmaster is Mr. Ronnie Cheng Kay-Yen.

== History ==
=== The first foundation ===
In 1860, Mrs. Lydia Smith (wife of the Bishop of Victoria) and the Society for the Promotion of Female Education in the Far East (Also known as Female Education Society, or &quot;FES&quot;) set up the Diocesan Native Female Training School, a day-school turned boarding school for native girls, affiliated with the Diocese of Victoria. As stated in its first annual report, the purpose of the school was &quot;to introduce among a somewhat superior class of native females the blessings of Christianity and of religious training&quot;. The school sat on Bonham Road, a small concrete house on a paddy field. Lady Robinson (the Governor&#x27;s wife) became the patron.

The school had a difficult existence. The Second Opium War aroused strong anti-British sentiment and so it was very unpopular for Chinese girls to learn English. The school was closed and then reopened under the name &quot;Diocesan Female School&quot;, but its finances did not improve. In 1868, Bishop Charles Alford took the school under his immediate superintendence.

=== The second foundation ===

==== 19th century ====

On 30 January 1869, in a bid to gain popular support, Bishop Alford issued an appeal to admit boys into the school and to turn it into an orphanage. The appeal was well received by the public. In September, the Diocesan Home and Orphanage, for boys and girls, both foreign and Chinese, was established.

In July 1870, William Arthur, formerly of the Garrison School, was appointed as the headmaster and Mrs Arthur as the matron.

In 1878, the school was placed in the grant-in-aid scheme by the Education Department.

In March 1878, Arthur resigned. Bishop Burdon proposed to stop admitting boys into the school and to bring it under the FES. In July, he withdrew his proposal following pressure from William Beswick, honorary treasurer of the DHO, although the Bishop still thought it inappropriate to have boys and girls boarding in the same school campus.

On 1 November 1878, George Piercy, then master of the Government Central School, was appointed to be the new headmaster. Piercy focused on the students&#x27; academics, and the school attained satisfactory results in the Cambridge and Oxford Local Examinations scholarships.

On 31 May 1879, the school committee resolved to stop accepting girls as boarders.

In 1891, the school was renamed the Diocesan School and Orphanage. In 1892, the remaining girls were transferred to Fairlea Girls&#x27; School (a forerunner of Heep Yunn School). The Diocesan School and Orphanage was transformed into a boys&#x27; school.

==== Early 20th century ====
In 1902, the school was renamed the Diocesan Boys&#x27; School and Orphanage. It is unclear when the school was renamed the Diocesan Boys&#x27; School, although the name was used as early as 1918.

Rev. William Featherstone, headmaster from 1918 to 1931, introduced the prefects&#x27; system, a house system and Speech Day. He also moved the school from Bonham Road to a hill site in Mong Kok. Construction was completed in 1926. In February 1927, the British military authorities took the school for use as a hospital for one year.

When war broke out in China in 1937, the school showed its support towards the Chinese Nationalist Party. In January 1938, a shoe-shining club was organised under the permission of Rev. Christopher Sargent to raise funds for the Nationalist government. Boys went to schools around Hong Kong and polished shoes for teachers and students. In 1939, there was a school strike when a student with Japanese citizenship was appointed as head prefect.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, most of the school staff, including then-headmaster Gerald Goodban, were imprisoned. The school building was transformed into a military hospital for soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army.

==== Post-war years ====
Imperial Japan surrendered in August 1945. The school remained under the control of the Kempeitai until November, when all the Japanese soldiers were captured.

On 21 March 1946, J. L. YoungSaye, a senior teacher, got the school to run again. Oswald Cheung and B. J. Monks took up the post of acting headmaster successively. Goodban returned from England on 19 November 1947. Repairs started during the Christmas holidays.

In 1949, Goodban introduced a new house system in which houses were named after former headmasters, along with the Piercy Challenge Shield.

In early 1950s, construction plans for a gymnasium, a Carnegie Hall (the old art room beside the demolished gymnasium) and a science wing were proposed.

In 1955, Canon George Zimmern, also known as George She, was appointed the next headmaster, the first Hong Kong-born old boy to be given the role. As headmaster, Canon She welcomed students from poor households and affirmed the Chinese language in school culture. Canon She also introduced the Garden Fête in 1955.

It was decided that the primary classes should be dropped for lack of space and that a completely new primary school - Diocesan Preparatory School - would be built, although the decision was only implemented in 1969.

James Lowcock became headmaster in 1961. Based on his previous experience in the school, he restructured the administration to improve efficiency and appointed more teachers to posts with designated duties.

In 1983, Jacland Lai succeeded Mr. Lowcock as headmaster. A language laboratory and a demonstration room were built. The electrics and alarm installations were renovated, the school walls repainted, and the facilities were computerised throughout the school.

====2000s====
In 2002, Lai was succeeded by Terence Chang, an old boy and then-headmaster of Jockey Club Ti-I College.

On 4 October 2002, the school committee proposed to join the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) with effect from September 2003. The application was accepted by the Education and Manpower Bureau in March 2003. The DSS was fiercely debated within the School throughout 2002. Chang was highly in favour of joining the DSS, but some students and most teachers opposed the DSS because they were afraid it would shut out students from poorer families. Alumni on the whole were slightly inclined towards the DSS. The school claimed that parents were in favour, though its findings have since been criticised as biased.

A primary school was built beside the secondary school campus. The project was financed by the government as part of the deal that saw the school join the DSS. The Diocesan Boys&#x27; School Primary Division (DBSPD) had its first, partial intake of students in 2004 and expanded its intake with students aged between 6 and 12 over the following years.

In April 2012, Diocesan Boys&#x27; School became the first secondary school in Hong Kong to have a school app on iOS and Android.

In September 2012, Chang retired and Ronnie Kay Yen Cheng – an alumnus who had been the conductor of the school choirs – succeeded him as headmaster.

In May 2020, the school became the world&#x27;s No.1 International Baccalaureate school, with an average mark of 42.

=== Roster of heads ===
==Campus==


The school is located on Kadoorie Hill in Ho Man Tin, Kowloon City District. The school campus houses a variety of different facilities.

===Buildings===
* The Main Building was built in 1926. It houses many classrooms, the school hall, the general office, the covered playground, the George She Christian Centre, the Music Room, the canteen and the tuck shop. It is shaped like the Chinese character &quot;主&quot;. Between the horizontal strokes of the character, there is a parking lot (for staff), a grass field in front of the tuck shop, a rock garden (built in 1926, redesigned in 1955 by former art teacher Mr Y. T. Kwong, and subsequently redesigned again in 2020), and a glass dining hall pavilion for boarding students. The top floor of the main building formerly served as the boarding house for students until 2007, when all boarders moved to the Samuel Tak Lee Building and the premises was repurposed.
* The Science Wing, the New Wing, and the New New Wing, built in the 1956, 1961, and 1968 respectively, to house more classrooms and laboratories. The New Wing houses the NSS library and lecture hall. The New New Wing has some laboratories and classrooms for G8 and G9.
* The Gymnasium, built in 1951, was demolished in the late 2000s to make way for the auditorium (see below). The small barbecue pit next to the building was kept and now sits next to the auditorium.
* The Headmaster&#x27;s Residence, built in 1952, was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for the Primary Division (see below).
Five new buildings were built between 2004 and 2012, when Terence Chang was headmaster. The buildings were designed by architect Thomas Chow (an old boy of the class of 1975), who won three awards from the Hong Kong Institute of Architects: two &quot;Medal of the Year&quot; awards (for his work on the Primary Division and on the Samuel Tak Lee Building respectively) and one &quot;Merit Award – Community Building&quot; (for his work on the Michiko Miyakawa Building and the Yunni and Maxine Pao Auditorium).
*The Primary Division was opened in 2004. It includes, among other facilities, thirty classrooms, computer rooms, an assembly hall, a covered playground, two basketball courts, and an outdoor amphitheater.
*The Mrs Tsai Ming Sang Building (a.k.a. the S.I.P. (School Improvement Project Building), built in 2005, houses a sky garden, 10 more classrooms for G7 and G8, laboratories, 3 multi-media learning centers, and a large staff room. &quot;S.I.P.&quot; stands for &quot;School Improvement Programme&quot;.
*The Samuel Tak Lee Building (a.k.a. the Sports and Dormitory Complex), named after a wealthy donor (an old boy of the class of 1958), was opened in 2008 to house dormitories and common rooms for boarders, as well as a 25-metre indoor swimming pool, a new gymnasium, weight lifting facilities and additional classrooms for day boys.
*The Michiko Miyakawa Building (a.k.a. the I.B. Building) opened in 2011 to provide classrooms for the newly introduced International Baccalaureate section. It contains St Augustine&#x27;s Chapel and the Ronald J. Chao Library amongst labs and classrooms for the IB students.
*The Yunni and Maxine Pao Auditorium, built on the site of the old gymnasium, opened in 2012. It houses the 800-seat Yip Kit Chuen Concert Hall, a couple of art galleries, and several other multi-purpose rooms.

==Curriculum==

The school uses English as the main language for instruction, although certain subjects (other than Chinese itself) use Chinese as the medium of instruction. Currently, both the Primary and Secondary Division follow the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority&#x27;s curriculum. Students start off with a common curriculum in Grades 7 to 9. After then, most students of Grade 10 or above fall into the New Secondary System (also known as &quot;334&quot;), and they will take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education examinations. Another batch of Grade 10 students fall into the Pre-International Baccalaureate (Pre-IB) programme if they choose. After they complete the Pre-IB programme, they will enter the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), and will graduate if they pass the IB Finals.

In March 2009, the school received media attention when a Form 4 student complained that he had had a nude female model as a subject in his art class, and alleged embarrassment. The visual arts teacher, employed for 27 years, told reporters that he had been inviting nude models without any complaint for nearly ten years. Then-Headmaster Terence Chang said it was a &quot;big fuss about nothing&quot;.

=== National security education ===
In December 2022, DBS said that it had already implemented national security education into its curriculum. The school stated that &quot;The objective is to deepen students&#x27; understanding of the country&#x27;s development and national security, enhance their sense of national identity and nurture them as good law-abiding citizens.&quot;

==Extracurricular activities==

School teams have been crowned Overall Champions in archery, athletics (14 Grand Slams), badminton (Grand Slam in 2009/10, 2010/11 &amp; 2023/24 in the Kowloon area), basketball (Grand Slam in 2013/14 in the Kowloon area), beach volleyball (Grand Slam in 2016/17, 2018/19 &amp; 2022/23), cross country (Grand Slam in 2017/18, 2018/19, 2022/23 &amp; 2023/24), fencing (Grand Slam in 2015/16, 2016/17 &amp; 2023/24), football (Grand Slam in 2017/18, 2018/19 &amp; 2023/24), Handball (Grand Slam in 2017/18), hockey, indoor rowing (Grand Slam in 2013/14, 2018/19, 2022/23 &amp; 2023/24), life saving (24 Grand Slams), rugby sevens, softball, squash, swimming (11 Grand Slams), table tennis (Grand Slam in 1960/61, 2017/18 &amp; 2021/22), tennis, tenpin bowling and volleyball (Grand Slam in 1977/78 in the Kowloon area, in 2017/18, 2018/19, 2022/23 &amp; 2023/24).

<doc id="556699" wikidata="Q5155116" url="?curid=556699" title="Como, New South Wales">
<text>Como is a suburb in southern Sydney, located on the southern banks of the Georges River, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. The postcode is 2226, which it shares with neighbouring suburbs Jannali, Bonnet Bay and Como West. The postal locality (suburb) of Como West was originally created in 1939 from within the greater Como locality and is bounded to the west by the Woronora River. The shoreline across Como features Bonnet Bay, Scylla Bay and Carina Bay.

==History==
The area now known as Como lies in the tradition lands of the Tharawal (Dharawal) people on the southern bank of the Georges River. The Sutherland Shire Council recognises Tharawal-speaking people as the traditional custodians of the area.

Well before it became Como, the locality had previously been known as Woronora.

Circa early 1883, a small weatherboard and iron-roofed building called the Woronora Hotel had been constructed by the proprietor, Mr. Thomas Hanley, in response to the rapidly growing railway worker&#x27;s camp situated adjacent to where they were planning to extend the Illawarra railway line across a bridge being constructed over the Georges River.

The Woronora Post Office opened on 16 May 1883, adjacent to the Woronora Hotel; this facility is also being operated by Mr handyman.

In 1922, the postal locality of Woronora was changed to Como upon a suggestion offered by Mr. James Frederick Murphy, manager of the Holt-Sutherland Co. and the affairs of Thomas Holt (1811–1888), who at the time owned much of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. Mr. Murphy likened the area to its namesake in Italy on account of its similarity to Lake Como at the foot of the Lepontine Alps and Lugano Prealps.

The Italian influence on the suburb is also reflected in many of the existing street names, which were named after various cities located throughout Italy, including Genoa Street, Verona Range, Tivoli Esplanade, Ortona Parade, Novara Crescent, Pavia Road, Cremona Road, and Loretta Avenue (originally named Loretto, a misspelling of the Italian city of Loreto).

On 5 May 1883, a Government notice in the Evening News (Sydney) announced a proposal for a &quot;new Public School at Worinora, George&#x27;s River.&quot;

Shortly after, on 10 July 1883 first mention of the Como Post Office appears in an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald, thus confirming the locality had already officially been renamed to Como.

On 25 September 1883, the NSW Government awarded the tender for timber construction of the new Worinora Public School to R.G. Troughton for the sum of £199 4s.

The Worinora School, built just to the south of Scylla Bay, opened on 16 April 1884.

Some newspapers and periodicals in the period 1884–1885 went so far as to wax lyrical over the broader section of Georges River water east of Murphy&#x27;s Pleasure Grounds and bounded by the rising headlands and hillsides, frequently referring to it in their articles as &quot;Lake Como.&quot;

On 14 June 1884, an article in the Australian Town &amp; Country Journal notes that Mr. Hanley had enlarged a room at the Woronora Hotel to cater as an assembly hall and theatre; for now, hundreds of women and children encamped nearby. The article also mentions that the Como Public School grounds were soon to be improved, thus confirming the school name had also been officially changed to Como.

Around this time, James Murphy and his brothers, John Francis and Michael Vincent, were also partners in managing Murphy&#x27;s Pleasure Grounds where to the annoyance of many locals, they had fenced off the small promontory east of their boat house and constructed a rotunda lookout and adjacent flag mast upon the highest viewing point (known by locals today as Como Mountain) and began charging day-trippers and tourists a small fee for access. Murphy&#x27;s Pleasure Grounds would later be reclaimed for public use and is generally known as the Como Pleasure Grounds to this day. James Murphy also constructed Como House, which burnt down in 1969. After James F. Murphy died, his estate provided scholarships for young men studying agricultural science at St John&#x27;s College Sydney and the Hawkesbury Agricultural College.

In January 1887, the first (presumed small) version of George Agnew&#x27;s Como Hotel had been constructed — however, only in a non-liquor capacity. It was most likely built upon the same site as the later larger versions would stand on. This small first establishment would last around two years until the much larger second version build began in March 1888 (see the version one timeline below for full details).

In March 1888, tenders were called for the construction of a major 20-room hotel at Como by master building contractor Robert Fielding (on behalf of George Agnew). However, this decision had been made at the same time when the majority of the temporary railway workers with their families had already begun moving out of Como and heading further south with the ongoing extension of the Illawarra railway line. In effect, George was building a bigger, grander hotel that would be reliant on a rapidly dwindling population to survive — in hindsight, a very poor business decision.

By 9 July 1890, leasing agent W.H. Tulloh was advertising the new, grand &quot;Como Hotel&quot; for purchase or lease. It seems George Agnew may have over-extended spending to get the grand second version of the hotel completed. Unsurprisingly, with the 1890 Depression in full swing, there were no takers for an expensive-to-run hotel, especially in a tiny town with a declining populace and no public school. With no further takers after more advertisement in October 1890, George Agnew was forced to apply himself for a Publicans&#x27; License. He struggled on, operating the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; until he could sell it to Daniel Sullivan in September 1891. By 1894, George Agnew was still in financial difficulty, being forced to sell all his household furniture and effects from his Como residence.

The second establishment of the Como Hotel was frequented by the Australian poet Henry Lawson, who lived at Como in the early 1900s. Local legend has it that Lawson &quot;used to row a boat from his house to the hotel and sell or recite his poems for beer.&quot;

Unfortunately, the tale of poor business woes for successive owners of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was to continue for many more years, as the tiny, slowly re-growing population, the terrible economic effect of WW1, the 1930s Depression &amp; WW2 all took their toll on the business (see Timeline from 1890–1925 below for full details).

In 1939, the Como West Post Office was opened, along with the first classroom(s) at the new Como West Public School. 
Como West was severely affected by bushfires in 1994, with upwards of 70 houses burnt down. Como West Public School was also destroyed by the fires, and a new school was built on the original land.

The second version of the Como Hotel was destroyed on 3 November 1996, after an electrical fault in the restaurant kitchen started a massive blaze. A sympathetically styled third version reconstruction was completed five years later on the same site in 2001.

==Boatbuilding/hire==
By early 1884, the Murphy brothers partnership had built and were managing the first commercial boathouse and boat hire facilities at Como, which is located just east of where the rail bridge over the Georges River was later to be constructed.

Como had also been developing a reputation (reported in the newspapers of the time) for skilled boat building, with suitable facilities located on the south bank of the Georges River, near where the future rail bridge was to be built. On Saturday, 17 January 1885, it was reported that the &quot;Active&quot; – a large steamer constructed of kauri, spotted gum, and ironbark, being 115 ft in length, weighing 150tons, with 40 hp paddle steam engines, was successfully launched at Como. She was built by Mr. Harry Stephens for Messrs C. &amp; E. Miller (one of the Illawarra Railway Line contractors) and was intended to carry railway materials from South Australian ports.

In June 1885, it was noted in the Evening News that &quot;Near the bridge the Holt-Sutherland Company are erecting a fine jetty where the largest vessels can anchor at high tide&quot; (it would be safe to presume this refers to the same one depicted in numerous old photos of the time which show a large new jetty east of James Murphy&#x27;s boathouse).

On 25 January 1886, a Tender was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by James Murphy (manager) for &quot;Leasing Boathouse, Residence, and slip near the railway platform, Como&quot;

On 16 February 1894, it was reported in the Evening News (Sydney) that the boat hire business of H.C. Press &amp; Sons was forced to close down their operations following a successful Court appeal against their application for Lease by their main competition – James F. Murphy &amp; F.S.E. Holt.

On 17 May 1894, it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that another boat hire operator, Mr. John H. Wills, had been successful in obtaining a lease on the western side of the Como Station for a boat shed and wharf.

Unfortunately for Mr. Wills, not long after he opened his boat hire business, on 7 December 1895, the Evening News reported that &quot;&quot;Wills&#x27;s boatshed, at Como, had been destroyed to-day by fire&quot;.&quot;

On 18 November 1898 an advertisement appears in the Evening News &quot;FIRST-CLASS BOATS FOR HIRE AT COMO, by H.C. Press. Trial solicited&quot;, indicating he had been successful in Appealing the previous decision, which now allowed them to re-open their floating multi-story Palace Hall and boat hire sheds for business once more. Press&#x27;s boat sheds held 64 wooden craft (mostly rowing skiffs). Their facilities were located immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the southern bridge abutment (just west of Murphy&#x27;s Boat House facilities). They can be seen in numerous historical images of the time.

By 1899, with the population of Sydney expanding rapidly southwards (thanks to the extension of the Illawarra railway line through the opening of the railway bridge across the Georges River at Como), the demand for riverboat tours along the Georges River upstream from Como had grown to the point where a large 200 passenger paddle steamer called the &quot;S.S. &quot;Telephone&quot;&quot; began making return tours to the Parkesvale Pleasure Grounds (now Picnic Point) from J.H. Wills Boat House &amp; jetty located on the western side of Como Station.

Circa 1905/1906, advertisements for H.C. Press &amp; Sons Ball Room &amp; Boat Hire facilities at Como cease, instead of advertising their other Woolloomooloo Bay boating facilities.

On 22 May 1920, an advertisement is placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by receivers J. Sydney Smith (Como), M. Maloney &amp; J. Roberts, for the Estate of the late John F. Murphy (one of James Murphy&#x27;s brothers and business partner) for the sale of the &quot;FEDERAL BOAT LETTING COMPANY, COMO...The assets consist of about sixty (60) light cedar varnished skiffs, which are stored in two boatsheds, one of which is a floating pontoon, above which is erected a large hall. There is also a four-roomed dwelling above a large workshop, also two wharves at side of sheds.&quot;

==Illawarra Railway Line==

===Georges River railway bridge and Como Station===

On 12 September 1882, Tenders were called for constructing the first section. C. and M. Millar won the contract to build the section from Redfern to Waterfall, crossing the Georges River and into the Holt-Sutherland Estate via the Double Bay paddock.

It was reported on 27 September 1884 in the Australian Town &amp; Country Journal that the station for Como would be located &quot;at the rear of the Worinora Hotel&quot;.

On 26 December 1885, the original single-track Como railway bridge spanning the Georges River began first services, with the opening of the bridge and single platform railway station at Como.

Rather alarmingly, it was not until 19 January 1886 (a month after opening) that the New South Wales Government Railway testing engineer carried out an initial load strength safety test on the bridge.
Also of interest is the media report on 2 March 1886 (3 months after the official opening) that construction of the initial station building was still underway.

The original layout of this single track and platform with a small station building on the east side of the track can be seen in a very rare early image circa mid-1886, held by the State Library of Victoria

Although &quot;Woronora&quot; had already proven popular with Sydney fishermen, small-boat sailors, and picnickers from the early 1880s, upon the eagerly anticipated opening of the new railway bridge at Como in January 1886, the locality immediately became far more popular as a weekend retreat for city folk venturing southwards on the Illawarra Line. The natural environment at Como made it popular for river cruises, and holidaymakers and trains were reported as being overcrowded on their first day of service along the newly extended section reaching Sutherland.

The rapid increase in passenger demand was such that by Feb 1891, the small single platform and station building located on the eastern side of the original &quot;single&quot; track were being replaced with dually extended station platforms, one on the east and one on the west side flanking a short section of single railway track over the bridge in the form of gauntlet track. In addition, a larger station building on the western station platform replaced the much smaller one that had originally stood on the single eastern platform.
Since 1942, the original Georges River rail bridge has carried Sydney Water&#x27;s pipeline, which runs from Woronora Dam to the Penshurst Reservoirs.

In 1972, a new concrete dual-track railway bridge was constructed to the west of the original Como Railway Bridge. It eliminated the bottleneck imposed by the original Gauntlet track design which had limited service numbers on the increasingly busy Sutherland line. A new Como railway station was built 800m further to the south, and the old station was demolished. The original Como Railway Bridge has been converted for use by pedestrians and cyclists.

==Hotels/Accommodation==
The first hotel to open in the area (circa 1883) was reported somewhat confusingly in newspapers of the day as either the &quot;Woronora&quot;, &quot;Woniora&quot;, &quot;Wiganora&quot; or &quot;Worinora&quot; Hotel (see Timeline below for details).

Newspaper references to a second, larger establishment that was constructed circa January 1887 and known generally as the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; do not appear until June 1887 (also see Timeline further down page for extensive detail)

=== The Woronora Hotel ===

==== Timeline ====

* Circa 1882/83 – First established by proprietor Mr Thomas Hanley (aka Handley), the &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; was a &quot;humble hostelry&quot; – a modest size weatherboard &amp; iron roofed building, located near the southern shore of the Georges River &amp; close by the first railway workers&#x27; tent camp, that also contained worker&#x27;s wives &amp; children, for a total population of around 120. 
* 12 May 1883 – A notice in the Sydney Morning Herald states – &quot;POST OFFICES. – Post offices will be established on the 16th instant, at Como (Railway Crossing, George&#x27;s River), near Woniora;&quot; This is the first public reference to the fact that the old locality of &quot;Woronora&quot; had officially been changed to &quot;Como&quot; (on the suggestion of James Murphy, manager of the Holt-Sutherland Co.) The &quot;Como Post Office&quot; was built adjacent to Hanley&#x27;s &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; &amp; Thomas managed both businesses.
* 10 July 1883 – A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on the progress of the Illawarra Railway Line extension at Georges River states – &quot;&quot;The other side of the river near to the mouth of the Woronora presents a busy scene. Here the line begins to pass over the Holt-Sutherland Estate. There is a little town of canvas, with an hotel of weatherboards and a post-office of currugated iron. This post-office is called &quot;Como&quot;, on account of the beauty of its natural surroundings and the lovely lake-like character of George&#x27;s River from this point to the eastward, second only to the celebrated &quot;Lago di Como&quot;, so well known to travellers on the continent of Europe&quot;.&quot; However, Thomas Hanley retained the name &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; for his small enterprise located adjacent to the &quot;Como Post Office&quot;.
* 17 May 1884 – The Australian Town &amp; Country (Sydney) reports that at Como, Georges River, &quot;There is a capital hotel called the Worinora, kept by Mr Hanley.&quot;
* 15 September 1884 – The Evening News (Sydney) reported a destructive fire had destroyed Mr Hanley&#x27;s Post Office &amp; store next to his &quot;Worinora Hotel&quot; with the loss of all postal records. An enquiry was held in October with an open finding.
* 27 September 1884 – The Australian Town &amp; Country Journal reports that at Como, Georges River, &quot;The petition of the inhabitants, relative to a railway station, has at length been acceded to, the site chosen being at the rear of the Worinora Hotel.&quot;
* 8 November 1884 – By this time, the population of Como had more than quadrupled. The Illawarra Mercury reports that Como &quot;boasts 500 or 600 souls. Most of the residences are of canvas, but there are a few of weatherboard and corrugated iron. Amongst the most substantial looking of these is the Public School and the Woronora Hotel&quot;.
* 29 December 1885 – A report in the Daily Telegraph titled &quot;A Trip To Como And Sutherland&quot; notes – &quot;At present there is only a platform at Como, but an embryo hotel is visible as the sign of a coming civilisation&quot;. The &quot;emryo hotel&quot; referred to being the otherwise titled &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot;.
* Mid 1886 – A rare, historic photo taken shortly after the first single track Como Station had been constructed in early 1886 shows a small iron roof building located directly below &amp; to the left of the station building, most likely being the &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot;. There can be seen some railway workers&#x27; tent lines nearby (the majority of workers had by then moved 3 miles or further southwards with the completion of the bridge crossing &amp; first cuttings). There are no signs whatsoever of any building activity further along the line, at the exact site where construction of the first version of George Agnew&#x27;s &quot;German Club&quot; aka the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; would later be completed circa January 1887.
* 6 November 1886 – The Evening News (Sydney) reported that due to a lack of space at the school to accommodate 200 visiting members of the Fruit Growers Union who had travelled to Como for a picnic (which was washed out from rain) &quot;&quot;Mrs Stephenson of the Woronora Hotel, very kindly threw open her private rooms for the use of those (ladies) who were crowded out of the schoolroom&quot;.&quot;
* 28 December 1886 – A critique in the Sydney Morning Herald laments the lack at Como of &quot;...a suitable place for the refreshment of the inner man. The Wiganora (sic) Hotel, respectably as it is conducted by Mr William Stevenson, is altogether inadequate for the demands made upon it at holiday time&quot; and continues &quot;&quot;...the owners of the Holt-Sutherland Estate might well consider whether it would not be to their interest to grant some enterprising capitalist a lease upon such liberal terms as would induce public to the district&quot;.&quot; This may have led the Holt-Sutherland Estate partners to invest in starting to build what would become the 1st version of the Como Hotel, with its first Licensee to be George Agnew.
* 24 May 1887 – In the meantime, following the public criticism (above), some renovations &amp; extensions must have been made to the Woronora Hotel, as what would be the last advertisement for the fully licensed &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald, proclaiming – &quot;COMO. COMO. COMO. – WORONORA HOTEL, Como, George&#x27;s River. This hotel is now open. If you wish to spend an enjoyable day visit Como on Queen&#x27;s Birthday, where you can get wines, spirits, and beers, of best brands. Also Pleasure and Fishing Boats for Hire.&quot;. Also note that the newly constructed competitor for the tourist trade becoming known in the media as &quot;Agnew&#x27;s Hotel&quot; or simply the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was NOT licensed at that time to serve liquor. 
* 25 May 1887 – A reporter in an article about the recently opened Illawarra Line at Como, makes mention of &quot;An hotel known as the &quot;Woronora&quot; Hotel, which marks another stage in the progress of the place, has just been opened at Como, and will, no doubt, prove a great convenience to visitors on holidays and other occasions&quot;.

Within a month, the newly constructed 1st version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; (though only a Provisional License, not yet legally able to sell alcohol) had advertised &quot;Open for business&quot;, with meals and accommodation for pick-nickers, day-trippers and tourists. It appears this increased competition for income from wealthier tourists visiting Como from this new, larger hotel would cause the lesser &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; to be closed down (presumably within the same year) since no more articles or advertisements referring to the &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; is to be found in the various newspapers of the time following the last advertisement listed here.

=== The Como Hotel ===
There appear to have been three (3) distinct versions of this establishment over time.

==== Original ====
The first version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was relatively small, made of weatherboard and iron-roofed. Its construction was most likely funded by the Holt-Sutherland Estate partners (who owned all the commercial land leases at Como). It was completed circa Jan 1887 by the remaining immigrant railway workers (and was known colloquially as the &quot;German Club&quot;). However, it appears from subsequent newspaper advertisements of the time to have been licensed for accommodation only (those &quot;refreshment needs&quot; being served by Mr William Stevenson, a new Licensee of the so-called &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; nearby). Unlike the advertisements for the &quot;Woronora Hotel&quot; espousing the availability of all forms of liquor, the first advertisements being placed by George Agnew for the early version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; NEVER mention the availability of spirits or alcoholic drinks – only meals, tea, coffee, accommodation, fishing, shooting, boat hire etc.

===== Timeline =====
*28 December 1886 – A critique in the Sydney Morning Herald laments the lack at Como of &quot;...a suitable place for the refreshment of the inner man. The Wiganora (sic) Hotel, respectably as it is conducted by Mr William Stevenson, is altogether inadequate for the demands made upon it at holiday time&quot; and continues &quot;...the owners of the Holt-Sutherland Estate might well consider whether it would not be to their interest to grant some enterprising capitalist a lease upon such liberal terms as would induce public to the district&quot;.[43] This may have led the Holt-Sutherland Estate partners to invest in starting to build what would become the 1st version of the Como Hotel, with its first Licensee to be George Agnew.
*Circa Jan 1887 – Work on constructing the 1st (much smaller) build of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was completed mostly by the available remaining German &amp; Italian railway workers, apparently followed by a few months of equipping &amp; fitting out.
*2 May 1887 – James Murphy, manager of the Holt-Sutherland Estate Land Co., Limited, places an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald for the &quot;LEASE OF HOTEL AT COMO&quot; adding &quot;The Buildings have just had extensive alterations and additions made, and a NEW LICENSE HAS BEEN GRANTED&quot;.
*20 June 1887 – The first advertisement appears in the Sydney Morning Herald for &quot;AGNEW&#x27;S COMO HOTEL. If you wish to spend an enjoyable day, don&#x27;t forget to visit COMO. The scenery cannot be surpassed in the colony. First class accommodation for visitors. Luncheon provided. Also splendid fishing grounds. Boats for Hire. GEORGE AGNEW, PROPRIETOR&quot; Note that this advertisement mentions accommodation &amp; meals only, since a Publican&#x27;s License to legally sell liquor had not been granted.
*1 January 1888 – In what should have been a boon for both Hotels, the first major sale of residential land blocks at Como (comprising 119 Lots) was undertaken on behalf of the Holt-Sutherland Estate by agents Richardson &amp; Wrench.
*17 March 1888 – An advertisement is placed in the Sydney Morning Herald by George Agnew for the &quot;COMO HOTEL, Como, George&#x27;s River, Illawarra Line. Parties staying at Hotel can have use of private Boats for fishing &amp;c. Tea and coffee at all hours. Terms moderate&quot;. Note that again, there is NO mention of any availability of liquor or alcoholic beverages. The tone is of a friendly, family oriented theme being promoted.

The definitive history and fate of the 1st version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; – apart from the scant few newspaper articles referred to here – is unclear. There appear to be no newspaper records relating to its initial construction, and no references that could help determine whether it was demolished outright and totally replaced by the second, much larger Edwardian styled version, or was simply incorporated into the second build (though that seems unlikely, given that the second version built circa 1888–1889 used 160,000 bricks in its ground floor).

==== Second version ====

The first version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; (also known colloquially as the &quot;German Club&quot;) must have been considered inadequate for the ongoing plans of the Holt-Sutherland Estate partners, who wished to develop a large number of residential blocks at Como &amp; thus needed to entice buyers to the area. Barely a year later, on 30 March 1888, it was reported that George Agnew (first proprietor of &quot;Agnew&#x27;s Como Hotel&quot;) had submitted plans &amp; applied for a Conditional License to construct a much bigger, brand new 16 room hotel (on a new Lease within the Holt-Sutherland Estate at Como). The License for this new build was granted one month later, in April 1888. Tenders sought by building contractor Robert Fielding were called during Dec 1889 – Feb 1890 for sub-contractors to supply large quantities of building materials &amp; carry out associated works, including the delivery of 160,000 bricks, quarrying local stone, providing and erecting large quantities of iron posts, railings &amp; ornamental castings, providing plumbing &amp; plastering work etc. Construction of this much grander, Edwardian-styled, multi-story Hotel establishment was completed by the end of June 1890. Early photos were taken circa 1894 clearly show the facade(s) bore an Establishment Year of &quot;1890&quot; in an artistic &quot;cartouche&quot; style, being a large &quot;1&quot; overlaid with a smaller &quot;8&quot;, with &quot;9&quot; to the left and &quot;0&quot; to the right of the centrally aligned &quot;1&quot; &amp; &quot;8&quot; combination.

Unfortunately, during 1890 Australian economic conditions worsened rapidly, with many large strikes crippling large industries (maritime, wool, coal etc.). The following 3 years saw a terrible economic Depression set in across the country. Unsurprisingly, due either to these prevailing poor business conditions (or just poor management), the first ten years of operation of the grand Edwardian styled version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; got off to a very rocky start. First proprietor George Agnew must have spent so much building the establishment that he was forced to advertise for a buyer/lessee soon after he had opened it. However, having failed to get a suitable buyer/lessee for his hotel after four months (Jul 1890 to Oct 1890), he himself was forced to apply for a Conditional Publican&#x27;s License while continuing to search for a buyer/lessee. His Publican&#x27;s License was granted on 17 October 1890.

With the general economy in ruins, George&#x27;s Buy/Lease advertisements were getting no takers, &amp; almost a year later in Sep 1891, &quot;Como Hotel&quot; owner/publican George &amp; his wife were successfully sued by Tooth &amp; Co. for a bounced cheque, being fined &quot;£5 and costs, in default one month&#x27;s imprisonment&quot;. Finally, on 25 September 1891 (almost 14 months after George&#x27;s first Buy/Lease advertisement), a notice in the Australian Star newspaper listed George Agnew had transferred his Publican&#x27;s License to a new Lessee &amp; publican, Mr. Daniel Sullivan, thus signaling a tumultuous period for the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; involving rapid turnover of owners/Licensees (see the partial Timeline below for more detail). By the time Paul Buchholz had bought out the License on 16 February 1905, he had become the 12th Licensee in only 13½ years (exclusive of the 1st owner/Licensee, George Agnew).

In 1983, the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was purchased by a unit trust company headed by Mr. Russell Coshott, who planned to &quot;restore &amp; upgrade the Hotel&quot; by subdividing &amp; selling as residential lots the adjoining two acres of freehold land. However, the plan was blocked by vehement local opposition.

On 16 July 1984, it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that &quot;The elegant old Como Hotel, described as an Australian version of a Victorian period seaside pleasure palace, has been protected by a Heritage Council anti-demolition order. The four-story white stucco, brick and timber hotel in Cremona Road at the southern end of the Como railway bridge has been a landmark of the Georges River foreshores since the 1880s. In recent weeks controversy has raged in the Como community about plans by the owners to erect a four-story building of 42 flats and a carpark behind the hotel. The plans have been opposed by local resident and environmental groups. Sutherland Shire Council recently rejected the development application on several grounds. These included that the flats would have a detrimental impact on the scenic quality of the locality&quot;. (footnote – the article is mistaken in stating this version of the Como Hotel was Established in the 1880s – it should read from 1890).

Unfortunately, on 3 November 1996, the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was ravaged by fire as a result of an unattended gas cooker in the restaurant kitchen.

===== Timeline 1888–1923 =====
*30 March 1888 – Notice of Application was made in the Daily Telegraph (Sydney) by George Agnew for a Conditional Publican&#x27;s License &quot;for a house to be erected at Como, Georges River, containing 16 rooms exclusive of those required for the use of the family, and in accordance with the plans lodged with the Licensing Clerk, Sydney&quot;.

*18 April 1888 – George Agnew was granted a Conditional License &quot;for an hotel at Como&quot;. Following the re-build/new construction, this new &quot;Como Hotel&quot; would go on to serve as the German workers&#x27; club throughout the duplication of railway lines and construction of the dual rail bridge.

Mr Forwood will probably visit the Gun Club grounds next Friday for the purpose of interviewing shooters.&quot;

==== Current ====
The existing &quot;third&quot; version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was constructed five years after the second version had been destroyed by fire in 1996, with the rebuild (on the same site) completed in 2001. It featured a modern but sympathetic interpretation of the 2nd version&#x27;s Edwardian design – the new restaurant was aptly named &quot;The Burnt Door,&quot; &amp; it displays at its centre the charred remains of one of the hotel&#x27;s doors which had been salvaged from the ashes of the inferno.

In early 2013, the current 3rd version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot;, located at 35 Cremona Road, sold for $4.6 million on a yield of 14.4% to the Riversdale Group (whose backers included John Singleton, retired head of Qantas Geoff Dixon, and private equity investor Mark Carnegie).

Towards the end of 2016, the Riversdale Group sold the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; for $5.6 million to the Oscars Hotel Group.

===== Establishment date clarification =====
The current (3rd) version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; bears an Establishment date (applied during 2001 construction) on the upper facades of &quot;1878&quot;. However, all the publicly available research shows this is clearly incorrect. With the locality of &quot;Como&quot; not even coming into existence until early mid-1883 &amp; the fact(s) that the original 1st version of the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; was &quot;not even completed construction until January 1887&quot;, nor was the second version construction completed until early 1890, the currently displayed date of &quot;1878&quot; is clearly wrong. This has led to many other less comprehensively researched articles regarding the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; quoting the historically incorrect Establishment date of &quot;1878&quot;, rather than what should be the factual Establishment date of &quot;1890&quot; (also confirmed by a vintage photo circa 1894 of the second version&#x27;s facade).

==Transport==
Como railway station is on the Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line of the Sydney Trains network. Como is the first station after crossing the Georges River from Oatley in the St George area. Como is approximately 35 minutes from Sydney Central.

Although the idea had been proposed in the early years, no road bridge was ever constructed across the George&#x27;s River at Como.

==Landmarks==
The Como Hotel is an Edwardian-styled hotel that was extensively rebuilt in 2001 after a large fire had destroyed the original 2nd version back in November 1996. It is easy to watch the local rugby league football from the balconies of this hotel. Dining can be had at the aptly named &quot;Burnt Door&quot; restaurant within.

Other landmark buildings in the suburb include the &quot;Como School of Arts&quot;, &quot;Cafe de Como,&quot; and the &quot;Como Marina&quot; on the Georges River.

Picnickers &amp; families with children are well catered for with the expanded play area facilities, lawns &amp; seating in and around the Como Pleasure Grounds.

The famous Sydney rock oyster can still be scrounged around the muddy Como foreshore by the adventurous at low tide.

==Schools==
Como features two well-regarded public schools: Como Public School and Como West Public School

===Como Public School===
The original name for the first school to be built in the locality was actually called the &quot;Worinora School&quot;. This name was changed shortly after it was completed construction in late 1883 to &quot;Como Public School&quot;. The school was located about 100 metres south of the southernmost extent of what would later become known as Scylla Bay. The site of the first school (with adjacent flagpole and school masters house) can clearly be seen in a photo of the area, taken circa 1894 AFTER the school had been closed down for good).

====Timeline 1883–1923====
=====Old school=====
*5 May 1883 – The Evening News (Sydney) reports &quot;NEW SCHOOL. – It is proposed to establish a public school at Worinora, George&#x27;s River.&quot; 
*25 September 1883 – The Evening News (Sydney) reports &quot;...tenders, in connection with public schools, have been accepted by the Government:- ... Worinora, wooden building, R.G. Troughton, £199 4s.&quot; 
*Feb 1884 – The school opened for the first time, according to New South Wales Government Records.
*April 1884 – The Sydney Morning Herald reported &quot;The school was opened in April 1884, by Mr Halsted, who, however, left on account of no residence being provided&quot;.
*May 1884 – Change of name from &quot;Worinora Public School&quot; to &quot;Como Public School&quot; according to New South Wales Government Records 
*14 June 1884 – The Australian Town &amp; Country Journal reports &quot;Considerable improvements are likely to be shortly effected at the grounds of the Como public school, in the welfare of which institution the inhabitants display a very laudable interest.&quot; Albeit &quot;the inhabitants&quot; at that time were almost entirely temporary railway workers &amp; their families. 
*10 February 1885 – The Sydney Morning Herald reports &quot;On Friday last several gentlemen from Sydney paid a visit to the Como Public School, and were much pleased with the manner in which the work of the school was being proceeded with&quot;, also &quot;The land upon which the school is erected is leased from the Holt-Sutherland estate, and commands a most charming view of the George&#x27;s River&quot;, and &quot;The present teacher, Mr. Edgar Robinson, took charge in May, when there were 38 pupils enrolled. For last quarter ending December 27, the enrolment was 85, and average attendance 56.6,&quot; 
*26 March 1885 – A letter to the Evening News (Sydney) reads &quot;BRAVO, THE MEN! – A correspondent says:- I wish to correct a mistake in connection with the presentation of toys to the Como public school children. Your report says that the toys were presented to the children by Sydney ladies. I wish to state, in justice to those who so kindly subscribed for them, that there was none given by Sydney ladies; but by the men employed on the railway. Since the toys were merely handed out of their packings by a Sydney lady to each successful competitor, nothing more. – A. NAVVYESS.&quot; A &quot;Navvyess&quot; would be the wife of a railway Navvy (aka labourer). 
*Oct 1885 – The first version of the &quot;Como Public School&quot; is closed for good, owing to a significant decline in the local population as the temporary railway worker camps moved further south along the Illawarra line extensions. It appears the buildings were retained for some years later, with the old school building, flagpole &amp; headmaster&#x27;s house seen in the background of the 1894 photo of the Como Hotel. An aerial photo dated 1930 shows the old school building(s) site had been completely cleared many years previous to the photo.
=====Current school=====
*21 January 1921 – A report in the Propeller (Hurstville) states &quot;The public school recently erected at Como will be officially opened by Mr. Mutch (Minister for Education) on Saturday afternoon, Jan. 29.&quot; The site of the new school was at the corner of Cremona &amp; Genoa Streets, Como (approx. 100m further south from the site of the original school). 
*1 September 1922 – The Propeller (Hurstville) reports &quot;...the Education Department has decided to provide additions to the Como Public School at a cost of £850. The school, which has been in existence less than two years, is already overcrowded, and with the rapidly-increasing population the need for additional school accommodation becomes more urgent&quot;.
*16 November 1923 – The Propeller (Hurstville) reports &quot;&quot;The new additions to Como Public School were opened on Friday last by Mr. J.B. Telfor, M.A., Assistant Under-Secretary of the Department of Education&quot;.&quot;

===Como West Public School===
The original &quot;Como West Public School&quot; was sited at the corner of Warraba Street &amp; Wolger Street, Como West. This first school was later completely destroyed in the devastating 1994 Como West bush fires.

====Timeline 1949–1994====
=====Old school=====
*1939 – First weatherboard classroom(s) constructed.
*13 October 1948 – The Construction magazine states &quot;The Minister for Education, Mr. R.J. Heffron, has approved of the establishment of an infants&#x27;school at the corner of Woronora Crescent and Warraba Street, Como West.&quot; This site is in the corner of the Como West Public School grounds. The building would later become a Scout Hall. 
*10 March 1949 – A notice in The Propeller (Hurstville) states &quot;...a tender for the erection of accommodation at the Como West Public School has been accepted. It is expected that the contractor will commence the erection of a double portable classroom in about three weeks&#x27; time, and the building will be completed and ready for occupation with as little delay as possible.&quot;
*20 March 1952 – An advertisement in The Propeller (Hurstville) &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Office, Children&#x27;s Weather Shed. Plans can be inspected at school, Como West Infants&#x27;, Cnr. Warraba and Wolger Rds., West Como.&quot;
*8 January 1994 – The weatherboard &amp; corrugated iron roof buildings of the original &quot;Como West Public School&quot; are completely destroyed during a devastating bush fire that swept through Como West &amp; Como.
=====Current school=====
*1994 – &quot;Como West Public School&quot; was completely re-built after the devastating 8 January 1994 Como West bush fires.

==Sport and Recreation==
Como is home to the St. George Rowing Club. Many renowned rowers begin their sculling careers here.

Como also features a number of parks, including Scylla Bay Oval (home to the successful Como-Jannali Crocodiles) and the historic Como Pleasure Grounds, home to the Como Swimming Club with swimming baths and a freshwater pool.

There is a pleasant public park originally called the &quot;Henry Lawson Memorial Reserve&quot; (so-named at a large public ceremony held before 600 attendees on 19 September 1954) which is accessed via both Wolger and Bulumin Streets in Como West which was, and still is, very popular with local inhabitants and their children with a modern playground to entertain. The original big swings and chrome steel &quot;slippery dip&quot; were installed circa 1954 on account of the West Como Progress Association. The park has been known to locals as &quot;the blue fence park&quot;, which has now changed to &quot;the black fenced park&quot; due to the recent renovation of the park.

==Como Population==
===Population timeline===
*1883 – May 1883 – Approx. 120 inhabitants total, comprising mainly temporary railway workers, some with families.
*10 July 1883 – A report in the Sydney Morning Herald states &quot;&quot;There is a little town of canvas, with an hotel of weatherboards and a post-office of corrugated iron. This post-office is called &quot;Como&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;There are hundreds of men, women, and children living in the vicinity of this point...&quot; 
*8 November 1884 – Report in the Illawarra Mercury states &quot;The second section of the railway commences at a place called Como, which owes its present activity and local habitation solely to the railway works. Just now it boasts of something like a population of 500 or 600 souls&quot;. This number would have dropped significantly by mid 1885, since most of the railway workers with their families kept moving southwards out of Como with the rapid extension of the Illawarra line though Sutherland, Heathcote &amp; beyond.
*18 April 1885 – It was reported in the Australian Town and Country Journal that &quot;Business is slack just now, owing to the exodus of population up the line; but good judges state that in a brief period Como will become a thriving settlement. Already land is being rapidly cleared for sale, with fine water frontages, and there should be good hotel prospects by-and-bye&quot;. The &quot;good judges&quot; referred to here were most likely representatives of the Holt-Sutherland Estate Land Co., keen to further their prospects.
*9 May 1885 – A report on Como in The Australian Town &amp; Country magazine noted &quot;The population is steadily moving up the line, and a continued increase from the 24-mile to the 30-mile takes place daily. Consequently last pay night was dull at Como, and business residents are also thinking of moving.&quot;
*6 October 1885 – It is reported in the Sydney Evening News that &quot;...the Government intends to erect a platform at Como, where there is a gradient of 1 in 44, and where there are no settlers at all;&quot; 
*1886–1890 – Como&#x27;s total population (both permanent &amp; temporary) would have remained very low. Even the first Como land sales conducted by the Holt-Sutherland Estate during the period 1887–1890 went mainly to a handful of wealthier developers, who then had trouble in on-selling these residential lots in any significant numbers once the economic conditions deteriorated even further towards the beginning of the 1890s.
*1890–1894 – One of the worst financial &amp; economic Depressions in Australia&#x27;s history swept across the country during this period. It is unlikely the permanent population of Como grew at all during this period of significant financial hardship for many businesses – but especially so for many of the low to middle income class workers who lost their jobs. Ironically, it was at this exact moment the new, grander Edwardian styled &quot;Como Hotel&quot;, ostensibly designed by the Holt-Sutherland Estate investors to attract permanent residents to Como in conjunction with their proposed Land sales, began trading. The subsequent lack of sufficient population growth or spending in Como ensured these early years for the (numerous) Licensees who &quot;tried their luck&quot; investing in the &quot;Como Hotel&quot; were fraught with financial difficulties.
*6 August 1931 – The first Catholic Mass was held in the School of Arts building in Como (70 residents attended), with a report in The Catholic Press stating &quot;Settlement at Como dates back more than 50 years, but the town has for various reasons made little progress, and its population is still very small&quot;.
*8 October 1952 – An article in the Weekly Times (Melbourne) mentions that &quot;Mrs. Larkin senior is postmistress at Como (population 680)&quot;. This further supports the ample evidence that Como&#x27;s &quot;permanent&quot; population had virtually stagnated for 68 years, following the temporary railway worker population boom of 1884. 
*2001 Australian Census – 3,673 people in 1,322 private dwellings.
*2006 Australian Census – 3,736 people in 1,290 private dwellings.
*2011 Australian Census – 3,789 people in 1,319 private dwellings.
*2016 Australian Census – 3,977 people in 1,352 private dwellings.

===Current demographics===
According to the of Population, there were 4,053 residents in Como. The most common ancestries in Como were English 43.0%, Australian 39.0%, and Irish 14.5%.

In Como, 91.3% of occupied dwellings were separate houses, compared to the national average of 72.3%. There was also a high rate of home ownership in Como, with only 10.6% of occupied private dwellings being rented.

<doc id="556700" wikidata="Q1122754" url="?curid=556700" title="Computer World">
<text>Computer World () is the eighth studio album by German electronic band Kraftwerk, released on 11 May 1981. It was accompanied by four singles, including a double A-side UK no. 1 featuring &quot;Computer Love&quot;.

The album is themed around computer technology and its rise within society. In keeping with the album&#x27;s concept, Kraftwerk showcased their music on an ambitious world tour. As was the case with the two previous albums, &quot;Computer World&quot; was released in both German- and English-language editions.

==Concept and recording==
&quot;We live in a computer world, so we made a song about it&quot;, said mastermind Ralf Hütter. &quot;Computer World&quot; has been described as a futuristic conceptual work that predicts the presence of computer technology in everyday life. Featuring themes such as home computers and digital communication, the album has been seen as both a celebration of computer technology as well as a warning about its potential to exert power on society with social control and digital surveillance. Despite its theme, the production of the album was completely analogue and did not involve any computer technology.

==Artwork==
The cover shows a computer terminal (apparently based on the Hazeltine 1500) displaying the heads of the four band members.

The inner sleeve artwork, created by Emil Schult and photographed by Günter Fröhling, depicts four slightly robotic-looking mannequins (representing the band members engaged in studio activities: performing, recording, mixing), similar to the artwork of the previous album, &quot;The Man-Machine&quot;, also created by Fröhling. In two photos, the mannequin representing Karl Bartos is seen playing a Stylophone, an instrument which is featured on the track &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Computer World&quot; peaked at on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 12 February 1982 for shipments in excess of 60,000 copies.

The track &quot;Computer Love&quot; was released as a seven-inch single in the UK, in June 1981, backed with &quot;The Model&quot;, from the group&#x27;s previous album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot;. The single reached in the charts. In December 1981 the two songs were reissued as a double A-side twelve-inch single, and reached on the UK Singles Chart in early February 1982, although &quot;The Model&quot; received the most airplay.

&quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; was released as a seven-inch single in the USA by Warner Brothers in 1981, pressed on a fluorescent yellow/lime vinyl, matching the color of the album cover. The flip side featured the Japanese version of &quot;Pocket Calculator,&quot; &quot;Dentaku&quot;. “Pocket Calculator” charted at No.38 in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Computerwelt&quot; was remixed in 1982 as a dance version with additional bass and percussion sounds. It was released in January 1982 as a twelve-inch vinyl single only in Germany. The original track was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1982. &quot;Computer World&quot; was also chosen by the BBC for use in the titles of their UK computer literacy project, &quot;The Computer Programme&quot;.

Kraftwerk issued several different versions of the single &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; in different languages: namely, German (&quot;Taschenrechner&quot;), French (&quot;Mini Calculateur&quot;), and Japanese (&quot;Dentaku&quot;, or 電卓). Also Italian version (&quot;Mini Calcolatore&quot;) was performed playback in television.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Computer World&quot; was ranked the second best album of 1981 by &quot;NME&quot;. But some contemporary critics were unimpressed. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer David Hepworth described the content as &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;gimmicky&quot; and not the presumed step forward by the group: &quot;Kraftwerk are seemingly content to tootle around on their instrument panels in the service of a bunch of non-songs about pocket calculators and computers&quot;, Hepworth wrote, giving the album a 4 out of 10 rating.

Retrospectively, &quot;Computer World&quot; has frequently appeared in numerous &#x27;Best&#x27;-listings. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed it at on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s. In 2018, &quot;Computer World&quot; was listed by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as the 18th best album of the 1980s. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed the track &quot;Computer Love&quot; as the 53rd best song of the 1980s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Computer World&quot; the 10th greatest EDM album of all time in 2012.

== 1981 Computer World tour ==

Following the release of the Computer World album, Kraftwerk went on a subsequent tour, that started on 24 May 1981 and ended on 14 December 1981.

==Legacy==
&quot;Computer World&quot; maintains a distinct influence over subsequent releases across a multitude of genres; this influence is particularly noticeable in early and contemporary hip-hop and rap.

In 1982, American DJ and rapper Afrika Bambaataa wrote the song &quot;Planet Rock&quot; and recorded chords inspired from &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics also included the Japanese number counting &quot;Ichi Ni San Shi&quot; from Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Numbers&quot;.

Cybotron&#x27;s 1983 release &quot;Clear&quot;, from the album &quot;Enter&quot;, contains multiple auditory elements of &quot;Computer World&quot;: the musical refrain closely resembles parts of &quot;Home Computer&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s More Fun to Compute&quot;; additionally, the track contains musical allusions to other Kraftwerk tracks.

Señor Coconut y su Conjunto, an electronic project of German musician Uwe Schmidt which initially covered Kraftwerk&#x27;s songs, published a merengue-styled version of &quot;It&#x27;s More Fun to Compute&quot; on their first LP &quot;El Baile Alemán&quot;, wrongly labeled as &quot;Homecomputer&quot; on the sleeve.

Coldplay used the main riff from &quot;Computer Love&quot; in their song &quot;Talk&quot; from their 2005 album &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;. La Roux used the main riff from &quot;Computer Love&quot; in their song &quot;I&#x27;m Not Your Toy&quot; from their self-titled debut album.

Ricardo Villalobos&#x27;s track &quot;Lugom-IX&quot; from the 2006 album &quot;Salvador&quot; prominently uses the riff from &quot;Computer World&quot;.

Fergie&#x27;s track &quot;Fergalicious&quot;, from her 2006 debut album &quot;The Dutchess&quot;, borrows heavily from two tracks on &quot;Computer World&quot;: the opening synth line from &quot;It&#x27;s More Fun to Compute&quot;, as well as the rhythmic component of J.J. Fad&#x27;s &quot;Supersonic&quot;, as the latter track&#x27;s beat is based upon the &quot;Computer World&quot; track &quot;Numbers&quot;. Arabian Prince, the co-producer of &quot;Supersonic&quot;, has been vocal about his admiration of Kraftwerk.

&quot;Home Computer&quot; is used as background music in the &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; episode &quot;A Computer, a Plastic Pony, and a Case of Beer&quot;.

LCD Soundsystem took &quot;Home Computer&quot; throughout the track &quot;Disco Infiltrator&quot;.

DJ Hooligan (Da Hool) sampled The Mix version of &quot;Home Computer&quot; for the Underground and Cursed remix of the song &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot; by Scatman John.

Beck took sounds from it and played &quot;Home Computer&quot; live.

Neil Young&#x27;s 1983 electronic album &quot;Trans&quot; was influenced by &quot;Computer World&quot;.

Ulf Ekberg of Ace of Base, when asked what brought him to music, if he had to boil it down to one reason, responded with: &quot;In one word: Kraftwerk. Once Kraftwerk released their 1981 album &quot;Computerwelt&quot; it all became clear to me: they showed the world that you can combine music with technology and be successful with it — and that was exactly what I wanted to do.&quot;

==Track listing==

* The German Version of &quot;Computer World 2&quot; is 12 seconds shorter and contains a different mix from the 2:30 minute mark.

==Personnel==
The original 1981 sleeve notes are relatively unspecific regarding roles, merely listing all the equipment suppliers and technicians under the heading &quot;Hardware&quot; and the various other people involved, such as photographers, as &quot;Software&quot;. By contrast, the 2009 remastered edition notes list the performer credits as the following:

<doc id="556703" wikidata="Q742284" url="?curid=556703" title="Alessandro Pavolini">
<text>Alessandro Pavolini (27 September 1903 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and essayist. He was notable for his involvement in the Italian fascist government, during World War II, and, as the leader and founder of the Black Brigades, also for his cruelty against the opponents of fascism.

==Early life and career==
A native of Florence, Pavolini was the son of , a major scholar of Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages. A brilliant student, he earned a law degree at the University of Florence and a political science degree at &quot;La Sapienza&quot; in Rome, travelling to and from between the two cities. His brother was the writer Corrado Pavolini.

After joining Benito Mussolini&#x27;s movement in Florence, he took part in several actions of the Blackshirts, and led a squad during the 1922 March on Rome – the moment when Fascism took over in Italy. Pavolini was assigned tasks in the cultural field (including youth programs launched by the fascists), while contributing to fascist publications such as &quot;Battaglie fasciste&quot;, &quot;Rivoluzione fascista&quot;, and &quot;Critica fascista&quot;. Thanks to his acquaintance with Florentine fascist leader Luigi Ridolfi Vay da Verrazzano, he broke into active politics, becoming Ridolfi&#x27;s deputy in 1927. From 1929 to 1934, he was local leader of the National Fascist Party (PNF) in Florence, as well as editor of the fascist publication &quot;Il Bargello&quot; (named after a military rank of the Middle Ages), which urged all intellectuals to contribute; Pavolini aimed for an image of Fascism as cultural and aristocratic – he initiated a series of cultural events that survived both Fascism and his death, including the yearly costumed re-enactment of the Italian Renaissance-era sport &quot;Calcio Fiorentino&quot;, the &quot;Maggio Musicale Fiorentino&quot; music festival and the Ponte Vecchio Artisans&#x27; Exhibit. Between 1934 and 1942, he was a regular contributor to &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; as a &quot;special guest&quot;.

==Prominence==
After becoming a member of the national PNF leadership in 1932, he moved on from local politics to become the president of the Fascist Confederation of Professionals and Artists, which propelled him to a leadership position in the Council of Corporations. He took part in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War as a lieutenant inspecting the squadron led by Galeazzo Ciano (a group nicknamed &quot;La Disperata&quot;), and as a correspondent for &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. Throughout his political career, Pavolini published cultural and literary essays, such as &quot;Disperata&quot; (&quot;The Desperate&quot;; 1937) and &quot;Scomparsa d&#x27;Angela&quot; (&quot;Angela&#x27;s Disappearance&quot;; 1940). In 1939, he was appointed by Mussolini Minister of Popular Culture, and served until January 1943.

Minister of Popular Culture (Minculpop in short) meant in fact Ministry of Propaganda and Pavolini had an iron grip on what the press could or could not publish. 
The written instructions to the press (including radio broadcasts and &quot;Luce&quot; cinema newsreels) were dubbed &quot;veline&quot; (tissue paper) by the newsmen and covered an amazing variety of domains (from forbidding to publish photos of boxer Primo Carnera knocked out and lying unconscious to the obligation of publishing flattering propaganda photos of Mussolini on a brand new Fiat tractor or forbidding to publish photos of Naples under the snow, fearing it would damage the tourism industry).

Minculpop also tackled the cinema industry (the famous and very creative Cinecitta studios in Rome were created by Mussolini&#x27;s will to act as a counter against Hollywood productions; the Venice film festival is also a creation of the fascist period).

Pavolini was deeply involved in the cinema industry (either on the propaganda or on the entertainment sides of it) and famously had a much publicized affair with Doris Duranti, a film actress of the period who starred in the &quot;Telefoni Bianchi&quot; subgenre of light comedy films and prominently featured in the very first bare-bosomed scene in Italian cinema.

The Allied invasion of Sicily and the ousting of Mussolini in Rome brought Nazi intervention and the proclamation of a new fascist puppet state, the northern Italian Social Republic. Pavolini was integrated into the Republic&#x27;s administration under Mussolini, and was immediately promoted head of the successor of the PNF, the Republican Fascist Party (PFR) (the only person to occupy that post); he took part in the drafting of major documents, including the Verona manifesto that called for the execution of former Grand Council of Fascism members who had voted against Mussolini in April, and was behind the creation of the paramilitary Black Brigades.

==Capture and death==

Pavolini was captured after a desperate escape attempt which saw him swimming across Lake Como and then trapped in a Mexican standoff over a half submerged rock. When Pavolini ran out of bullets, he was finally apprehended and executed only under Italian law by the partisans in Dongo. Before burial, his body was hung upside down in public, along with Mussolini, Mussolini&#x27;s mistress Clara Petacci, the former Party Secretary Achille Starace, Nicola Bombacci and others in Piazzale Loreto, Milan.

<text>New Hamburg station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, serving Wappingers Falls, New York.

== History ==
The Hudson River Railroad was built through New Hamburg in 1849, opening on December 6, in order to expand the Troy and Greenbush Railroad from the Albany area to New York City. Earlier attempts to build the railroad in 1848 were delayed by a fatal cholera outbreak among railroad workers between 1848 and 1849. The HRR was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1864.

The New Hamburg station bisects the hamlet&#x27;s Main Street. Old photographs show a grade crossing used to exist here; since the line was double-tracked in 1928, however, getting from one end of Main Street to the other has required a detour via nearby Bridge Street. Another bridge further north on Reed Road is the only other crossing in the hamlet.

=== Closing and reopening ===
New Hamburg is notable as one of the few in the Metro-North system to have closed and reopened. In April 1973, the Penn Central Railroad (PC) announced planned to close flag stops, including New Hamburg, Oscawanna, Manitou and Chelsea stations on the Hudson Line and Morrisania on the Harlem Line due to low ridership. The stops were initially supposed to be closed on April 29, but the date was pushed back to May 9 due to a 90-day freeze imposed by Congress on the status of railroad crews. This change was opposed by a group of New Hamburg commuters led by Frank Lucas, who attested that the station&#x27;s usage was 15 to 20 daily passengers, not the 2 indicated by PC figures. The PC spokesman said that commuters from Poughkeepsie often complained about the frequency of stops on the line. Lucas stated that flag stops often took less than 30 seconds, which should not be considered an inconvenience.

On June 7, 1973, the Penn Central Railroad announced that the station would close along with the Oscawanna, Manitou and Chelsea stations on the Hudson Line due to low ridership on July 2, 1973. This announcement strongly disturbed two state legislators from Dutchess County, who stated that the MTA had indicated that no decision had been reached in a letter from the previous month, due to the inconvenience its closure would result in, and because of the short notice of the announcement. The original New Hamburg station was closed by the Penn Central Railroad on July 2, 1973.

After the station&#x27;s closure, local residents pressed for its reopening. On February 26, 1980, the MTA held a meeting to discuss the cost of reopening the station. The MTA estimate that it could cost $180,000 to $200,000. Its proposal entailed the installation of new platforms, lighting, and parking for 100 cars, and the construction of a pedestrian overpass to replace the tunnel, which was boarded up due to flooding. County Legislator Joseph Poillucci said that he would only be willing to sponsor the project if it could be cut to less than $100,000. After the meeting, Lois Sackelos created the New Hamburg Station Citizen&#x27;s Committee to determine the minimum investment needed to get the station into acceptable use and how to finance it. The committee revealed its plan on March 6, 1980, which reduced the cost to $50,000. It proposed eliminating the shelter for passengers, reducing the amount of lighting being called for, using the existing passenger tunnel with the installation of pumps, and the paving over of the existing platform instead of building a new one. The MTA assured Sackelos that trains could start stopping immediately if funding was provided and if the MTA approved of the plan.

The MTA cut the cost estimate for the station in March 1980 from $180,000 to $65,000 for a scaled down plan, accepting the basic concept of the committee&#x27;s plan. It estimated the cost of the parking to be $15,000. The original plan had included a complete renovation, including a $100,000 overpass replacing the tunnel under the tracks. Sackelos&#x27; group estimate that the project would cost $50,000. The cost discrepancy had to do with the construction of a new platform. The MTA called for the construction of a four-car platform for $25,000, while the group&#x27;s proposal called for the construction of a three-car long platform for $9,000 to $10,000.

In April 1980, the MTA agreed to pay for the remainder of the station work if the County provided $15,000 for the parking lot. In April 1980, the Dutchess County Legislature appropriated $3,000 to reopen the station, with an additional $15,000 to pave the parking lot, provide lighting and repair the tunnel under the tracks. However, in August, the MTA asked for $15,000 to maintain the area. That month, County Legislator Joseph Poillucci requested that the station be reopened after receiving a petition signed by 800 people from the Sackelos&#x27; citizens group. Poillucci expected 200 daily passengers for the station who drive to Poughkeepsie or Beacon to catch the train.

In April 1981, the Dutchess County Legislature held a vote on the contract between the MTA and Dutchess County to reopen the station. It had taken a year to negotiate the contract, which requires that the county pay $15,000 to repair the stop prior to its reopening. The yearly charge for the station was estimated to be $14,500. The station reopened on October 17, 1981, after the MTA took over the line after efforts led by New Hamburg resident Lois Sackelos, and County Legislator Joseph Poillucci. The station was renovated and the platforms were lengthened. The reopening of the station was appreciated by commuters, but not with all local residents, who believed that it was hurting the town&#x27;s character as noise, traffic and litter increased. In 1982, the station recorded 166 morning rush hour commuters. Ridership during this period increased to 207 in 1985, 354 in 1987 and 401 in 1989, following a drastic increase in ridership on the Upper Hudson Line. On July 12, 1988, Metro-North announced plans to build 80 new parking spaces around the station for $140,000 so the lot could accommodate 360 cars. At the time, the station was the second fastest-growing station on Metro-North behind Brewster North with 120% growth since 1982. In the early 1990s, the platforms were replaced by high-level platforms for $2.5 million. The parking lot was increased by 70 spots for $300,000 in 1991. On January 19, 1993, Dutchess County&#x27;s new LOOP bus service began stopping at New Hamburg to connect with five morning trains and six evening trains in order to ease station parking.

On March 22, 1994, Metro-North agreed to add more parking at the station after local officials threatened to delay $954 in railroad improvements. 130 more passengers used the station than there were parking spots, on average. Metro-North had been planning to spend $1.1 million to improve parking in 1998. On April 27, 1994, the Poughkeepsie Town Board passed a law prohibiting parking in New Hamburg Park as commuters had started parking there due to a parking shortage. Earlier that month, Metro-North agreed to add 250 spaces. By June 40 spaces were to be added to the 452-space lot by repainting the lot, and additional 40 were to be added by December. The number of spaces later went up to 585, and in 1996, Metro-North leased land for 85 more spaces.

On March 12, 2003, a 1000-pound door blew off of a CSX freight train and destroyed the station shelter. The repairs were estimated to cost $400,000. In January 2004, months after it was supposed to be installed, Metro-North added a temporary shelter.

<doc id="556706" wikidata="Q163080" url="?curid=556706" title="Kalākaua">
<text>Kalākaua (David Laʻamea Kamanakapuʻu Māhinulani Nālaʻiaʻehuokalani Lumialani Kalākaua; November 16, 1836 – January 20, 1891), was the last king and penultimate monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, reigning from February 12, 1874, until his death in 1891. Succeeding Lunalilo, he was elected to the vacant throne of Hawaiʻi against Queen Emma. Kalākaua was known as the Merrie Monarch for his convivial personality – he enjoyed entertaining guests with his singing and ukulele playing. At his coronation and his birthday jubilee, the hula, which had hitherto been banned in public in the kingdom, became a celebration of Hawaiian culture.

During Kalākaua&#x27;s reign, the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 brought great prosperity to the kingdom. Its renewal continued the prosperity but allowed United States to have exclusive use of Pearl Harbor. In 1881, Kalākaua took a trip around the world to encourage the immigration of contract sugar plantation workers. He wanted Hawaiians to broaden their education beyond their nation. He instituted a government-financed program to sponsor qualified students to be sent abroad to further their education. Two of his projects, the statue of Kamehameha I and the rebuilding of ʻIolani Palace, were expensive endeavors but are popular tourist attractions today.

Extravagant expenditures and Kalākaua&#x27;s plans for a Polynesian confederation played into the hands of annexationists who were already working toward a United States takeover of Hawaiʻi. In 1887, Kalākaua was pressured to sign a new constitution that made the monarchy little more than a figurehead position. After his brother William Pitt Leleiohoku II died in 1877, the king named their sister Liliʻuokalani as heir-apparent. She acted as regent during his absences from the country. After Kalākaua&#x27;s death, she became the last monarch of Hawaiʻi.

==Early life and family==
Kalākaua was born at 2:00 a.m. on November 16, 1836, to Caesar Kaluaiku Kapaʻakea and Analea Keohokālole in the grass hut compound belonging to his maternal grandfather ʻAikanaka, at the base of Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu. Of the &quot;aliʻi&quot; class of Hawaiian nobility, his family was considered collateral relations of the reigning House of Kamehameha, sharing common descent from the 18th-century &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. From his biological parents, he descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, two of the five royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both his mother and father, was one of the royal twins alongside Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms. However, Kalākaua and his siblings traced their high rank from their mother&#x27;s line of descent, referring to themselves as members of the &quot;Keawe-a-Heulu line&quot;, although later historians would refer to the family as the House of Kalākaua. The second surviving child of a large family, his biological siblings included his elder brother James Kaliokalani, and younger siblings Lydia Kamakaʻeha (later renamed Liliʻuokalani), Anna Kaʻiulani, Kaʻiminaʻauao, Miriam Likelike and William Pitt Leleiohoku II.
Given the name Kalākaua, which translates into &quot;The Day [of] Battle,&quot; the date of his birth coincided with the signing of the unequal treaty imposed by British Captain Lord Edward Russell of the &quot;Actaeon&quot; on Kamehameha III. He and his siblings were &quot;hānai&quot; (informally adopted) to other family members in the Native Hawaiian tradition. Prior to birth, his parents had promised to give their child in &quot;hānai&quot; to Kuini Liliha, a high-ranking chiefess and the widow of High Chief Boki. However, after he was born, High Chiefess Haʻaheo Kaniu took the baby to Honuakaha, the residence of the king. &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot; (regent) Elizabeth Kīnaʻu, who disliked Liliha, deliberated and decreed his parents to give him to Haʻaheo and her husband Keaweamahi Kinimaka. When Haʻaheo died in 1843 she bequeathed all her properties to him. After Haʻaheo&#x27;s death, his guardianship was entrusted to his &quot;hānai&quot; father, who was a chief of lesser rank; he took Kalākaua to live in Lāhainā on the island of Maui. Kinimaka would later marry Pai, a subordinate Tahitian chiefess, who treated Kalākaua as her own until the birth of her own son.

==Education==
At the age of four, Kalākaua returned to Oʻahu to begin his education at the Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School (later renamed the Royal School). He and his classmates had been formally proclaimed by Kamehameha III as eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. His classmates included his siblings James Kaliokalani and Lydia Kamakaʻeha and their thirteen royal cousins including the future kings Kamehameha IV, Kamehameha V and Lunalilo. They were taught by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke. At the school, Kalākaua became fluent in English and the Hawaiian language and was noted for his fun and humor rather than his academic prowess. The strong-willed boy defended his less robust elder brother Kaliokalani from the older boys at the school.

In October 1840, their paternal grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons to visit him on the night before his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed the guardian of the royal children John Papa ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not known if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the public hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes&#x27; had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys.

After the Cookes retired and closed the school in 1850, Kalākaua briefly studied at Joseph Watt&#x27;s English school for native children at Kawaiahaʻo and later joined the relocated day school (also called Royal School) run by Reverend Edward G. Beckwith. Illness prevented him from finishing his schooling and he was sent back to Lāhainā to live with his mother.
Following his formal schooling, he studied law under Charles Coffin Harris in 1853. Kalākaua would appoint Harris as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaiʻi in 1877.

==Political and military careers==

Kalākaua&#x27;s various military, government and court positions prevented him from fully completing his legal training. He received his earliest military training under the Prussian officer, Major Francis Funk, who instilled an admiration of the Prussian military system. In 1852, Prince Liholiho, who would later reign as Kamehameha IV, appointed Kalakaua as one of his aide-de-camp on his military staff. The following year, he commissioned Kalākaua as brevet captain in the infantry. In the army, Kalākaua served as first lieutenant in his father Kapaʻakea&#x27;s militia of 240 men and later worked as military secretary to Major John William Elliott Maikai, the adjutant general of the army. He was promoted to major and assigned to the personal staff of Kamehameha IV when the king ascended to the throne in 1855. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1858.

He became a personal associate and friend of Prince Lot, the future Kamehameha V, who instilled his mission of &quot;Hawaiʻi for Hawaiians&quot; in the young Kalākaua. In the fall of 1860, when he was Chief Clerk of the kingdom&#x27;s Department of the Interior, Kalākaua accompanied Prince Lot, high chief Levi Haʻalelea and Hawaii&#x27;s Consul for Peru, Josiah C. Spalding, on a two-month tour of British Columbia and California. They sailed from Honolulu aboard the yacht &quot;Emma Rooke&quot;, on August 29, arriving on September 18 in Victoria, British Columbia, where they were received by the local dignitaries of the city. In California, the party visited San Francisco, Sacramento, Folsom and other local areas where they were honorably received.

In 1856, Kalākaua was appointed a member of the Privy Council of State by Kamehameha IV. He was also appointed to the House of Nobles, the upper body of the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1858, serving there until 1873. He served as 3rd Chief Clerk of the Department of the Interior in 1859 under Prince Lot who was Minister of the Interior before becoming king in 1863. He held this position until 1863. On June 30, 1863, Kalākaua was appointed Postmaster General and served until his resignation on March 18, 1865. In 1865, he was appointed the King&#x27;s Chamberlain and served until 1869 when he resigned to finish his law studies. In 1870, he was admitted to the Hawaiian bar and was hired as a clerk in the Land Office, a post he held until he came to the throne. He was decorated a Knight Companion of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I in 1867.

American writer Mark Twain, working as a traveling reporter for the Sacramento &quot;Daily Union&quot;, visited Hawaiʻi in 1866 during the reign of Kamehameha V. He met the young Kalākaua and other members of the legislature and noted:
==Marriage==

Kalākaua was briefly engaged to marry Princess Victoria Kamāmalu, the younger sister of Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V. However, the match was terminated when the princess decided to renew her on-and-off betrothal to her cousin Lunalilo. Kalākaua would later fall in love with Kapiʻolani, the young widow of Bennett Nāmākēhā, the uncle of Kamehameha IV&#x27;s wife Queen Emma. A descendant of King Kaumualiʻi of Kauai, Kapiʻolani was Queen Emma&#x27;s lady-in-waiting and Prince Albert Edward Kamehameha&#x27;s nurse and caretaker. They married on December 19, 1863, in a quiet ceremony conducted by a minister of the Anglican Church of Hawaiʻi. The timing of the wedding was heavily criticized since it fell during the official mourning period for King Kamehameha IV. The marriage remained childless.

==Political ascendancy==
===1873 election===
King Kamehameha V, died on December 12, 1872, without naming a successor to the throne. Under the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, if the king did not appoint a successor, a new king would be appointed by the legislature to begin a new royal line of succession.

There were several candidates for the Hawaiian throne including Bernice Pauahi Bishop, who had been asked to succeed to the throne by Kamehameha V on his deathbed but had declined the offer. However, the contest was centered on the two high-ranking male &quot;aliʻi&quot;, or chiefs: Lunalilo and Kalākaua. Lunalilo was more popular, partly because he was a higher-ranking chief than Kalākaua and was the immediate cousin of Kamehameha V. Lunalilo was also the more liberal of the two—he promised to amend the constitution to give the people a greater voice in the government. According to historian Ralph S. Kuykendall, there was an enthusiasm among Lunalilo&#x27;s supporters to have him declared king without holding an election. In response, Lunalilo issued a proclamation stating that, even though he believed himself to be the rightful heir to the throne, he would submit to an election for the good of the kingdom. On January 1, 1873, a popular election was held for the office of King of Hawaiʻi. Lunalilo won with an overwhelming majority while Kalākaua performed extremely poorly receiving 12 votes out of the more than 11,000 votes cast. The next day, the legislature confirmed the popular vote and elected Lunalilo unanimously. Kalākaua conceded.

===1874 election===
Following Lunalilo&#x27;s ascension, Kalākaua was appointed as colonel on the military staff of the king. He kept politically active during Lunalilo&#x27;s reign, including leadership involvement with a political organization known as the Young Hawaiians; the group&#x27;s motto was &quot;Hawaiʻi for the Hawaiians&quot;. He had gained political capital with his staunch opposition to ceding any part of the Hawaiian islands to foreign interests. During the ʻIolani Barracks mutiny by the Royal Guards of Hawaiʻi in September 1873, Kalākaua was suspected to have incited the native guards to rebel against their white officers. Lunalilo responded to the insurrection by disbanding the military unit altogether, leaving Hawaiʻi without a standing army for the remainder of his reign.

The issue of succession was a major concern especially since Lunalilo was unmarried and childless at the time. Queen Dowager Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV, was considered to be Lunalilo&#x27;s favorite choice as his presumptive heir. On the other hand, Kalākaua and his political cohorts actively campaigned for him to be named successor in the event of the king&#x27;s death. Among the other candidates considered viable as Lunalilo&#x27;s successor was the previously mentioned Bernice Pauahi Bishop. She had strong ties to the United States through her marriage to wealthy American businessman Charles Reed Bishop who also served as one of Lunalilo&#x27;s cabinet ministers. When Lunalilo became ill several months after his election, Native Hawaiians counseled with him to appoint a successor to avoid another election. However he may have personally felt about Emma, he never put it in writing. He failed to act on the issue of a successor, and died on February 3, 1874, setting in motion a bitter election. While Lunalilo did not think of himself as a Kamehameha, his election continued the Kamehameha line to some degree making him the last of the monarchs of the Kamehameha dynasty.

Pauahi chose not to run. Kalākaua&#x27;s political platform was that he would reign in strict accordance with the kingdom&#x27;s constitution. Emma campaigned on her assurance that Lunalilo had personally told her he wanted her to succeed him. Several individuals who claimed first-hand knowledge of Lunalilo&#x27;s wishes backed her publicly. With Lunalilo&#x27;s privy council issuing a public denial of that claim, the kingdom was divided on the issue. British Commissioner James Hay Wodehouse put the British and American forces docked at Honolulu on the alert for possible violence.

The election was held on February 12, and Kalākaua was elected by the Legislative Assembly by a margin of thirty-nine to six. His election provoked the Honolulu Courthouse riot where supporters of Queen Emma targeted legislators who supported Kalākaua; thirteen legislators were injured. The kingdom was without an army since the mutiny the year before and many police officers sent to quell the riot joined the mob or did nothing. Unable to control the mob, Kalākaua and Lunalilo&#x27;s former ministers had to request the aid of American and British military forces docked in the harbor to put down the uprising.

==Reign==
Given the unfavorable political climate following the riot, Kalākaua was quickly sworn in the following day, in a ceremony witnessed by government officials, family members, foreign representatives and some spectators. This inauguration ceremony was held at Kīnaʻu Hale, the residence of the Royal Chamberlain, instead of Kawaiahaʻo Church, as was customary. The hastiness of the affair would prompt him to hold a coronation ceremony in 1883. Upon ascending to the throne, Kalākaua named his brother, William Pitt Leleiohoku, Leleiohoku II, as his heir-apparent. When Leleiohoku II died in 1877, Kalākaua changed the name of his sister Lydia Dominis to Liliuokalani and designated her as his heir-apparent.

From March to May 1874, he toured the main Hawaiian Islands of Kauai, Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, Molokai and Oahu and visited the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement.

===Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 and its extension===
Within a year of Kalākaua&#x27;s election, he helped negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. This free trade agreement between the United States and Hawaiʻi, allowed sugar and other products to be exported to the US duty-free. He led the Reciprocity Commission consisting of sugar planter Henry A. P. Carter of C. Brewer &amp; Co., Hawaiʻi Chief Justice Elisha Hunt Allen, and Minister of Foreign Affairs William Lowthian Green. Kalākaua became the first reigning monarch to visit America. The state dinner in his honor hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant was the first White House state dinner ever held.

Many in the Hawaiʻi business community were willing to cede Pearl Harbor to the United States in exchange for the treaty, but Kalākaua was opposed to the idea. A seven-year treaty was signed on January 30, 1875, without any Hawaiian land being ceded. San Francisco sugar refiner Claus Spreckels became a major investor in Hawaiʻi&#x27;s sugar industry. Initially, he bought half of the first year&#x27;s production; ultimately he became the plantations&#x27; major shareholder. Spreckels became one of Kalākaua&#x27;s close associates.

When it expired, an extension of the treaty was negotiated, giving exclusive use of Pearl Harbor to the United States. Ratifications by both parties took two years and eleven months, and were exchanged on December 9, 1887, extending the agreement for an additional seven years.

Over the term of Kalākaua&#x27;s reign, the treaty had a major effect on the kingdom&#x27;s income. In 1874, Hawaiʻi exported $1,839,620.27 in products. The value of exported products in 1890, the last full year of his reign, was $13,282,729.48, an increase of 722%. The export of sugar during that period grew from 24,566,611 pounds to 330,822,879 pounds.

===Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad===

The Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad was a government-funded educational program during Kalākaua&#x27;s reign to help students further their education beyond the institutions available in Hawaiʻi at that time. Between 1880 and 1887, Kalākaua selected 18 students for enrollment in a university or apprenticeship to a trade, outside the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. These students furthered their education in Italy, England, Scotland, China, Japan and California. During the life of the program, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to support it. When the Bayonet Constitution went into effect, the students were recalled to Hawaiʻi.

===Trip around the world===
King Kalākaua and his boyhood friends William Nevins Armstrong and Charles Hastings Judd, along with personal cook Robert von Oelhoffen, circumnavigated the globe in 1881. The purpose of the 281-day trip was to encourage the importation of contract labor for plantations. Kalākaua set a world record as the first monarch to travel around the world. He appointed his sister and heir-apparent Liliuokalani to act as Regent during his absence.

Setting sail on January 20, they visited California before sailing to Asia. There they spent four months opening contract labor dialogue in Japan and China, while sightseeing and spreading goodwill through nations that were potential sources for workers. They continued through Southeast Asia, and then headed for Europe in June, where they stayed until mid-September. Their most productive immigration talks were in Portugal, where Armstrong stayed behind to negotiate an expansion of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s existing treaty with the government.

President James A. Garfield in Washington, D.C., had been assassinated in their absence. On their return trip to the United States, Kalākaua paid a courtesy call on Garfield&#x27;s successor President Chester A. Arthur.
Before embarking on a train ride across the United States, Kalākaua visited Thomas Edison for a demonstration of electric lighting, discussing its potential use in Honolulu.

They departed for Hawaiʻi from San Francisco on October 22, arriving in Honolulu on October 31. His homecoming celebration went on for days. He had brought the small island nation to the attention of world leaders, but the trip had sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaiʻi there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse to see the world. Eventually, his efforts bore fruit in increased contract labor for Hawaiʻi.

Thomas Thrum&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883&quot; reported Kalākaua&#x27;s tour expense appropriated by the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on.

===ʻIolani Palace===
&#x27;Iolani Palace is the only royal palace on US soil. The first palace was a coral and wood structure which served primarily as office space for the kingdom&#x27;s monarchs beginning with Kamehameha III in 1845. By the time Kalākaua became king, the structure had decayed, and he ordered it destroyed to be replaced with a new building. During the 1878 session of the legislature Finance Chairman Walter Murray Gibson, a political supporter of Kalākaua&#x27;s, pushed through appropriations of $50,000 for the new palace.

Construction began in 1879, with an additional $80,000 appropriated later to furnish it and complete the construction. Three architects worked on the design, Thomas J. Baker, Charles J. Wall and Isaac Moore. December 31, 1879, the 45th birthday of Queen Kapiʻolani, was the date Kalākaua chose for the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone. Minister of Foreign Affairs John Mākini Kapena delivered the ceremony&#x27;s formal address in Hawaiian. As Master of the Freemason Lodge Le Progres de L&#x27;Oceanie, Kalākaua charged the freemasons with orchestrating the ceremonies. The parade preceding the laying of the cornerstone involved every civilian and military organization in Hawaiʻi. &quot;The Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; noted it was &quot;one of the largest seen in Honolulu for some years&quot;. A copper time capsule containing photographs, documents, currency, and the Hawaiian census was sealed inside the cornerstone. After speeches had been made, the freemasons presented the king with &quot;the working tools of a mason&quot;, a plumb bob, level, square tool, and a trowel.

In between the laying of the cornerstone and the finishing of the new palace, Kalākaua had seen how other monarchs lived. He wanted ʻIolani to measure up to the standards of the rest of the world. The furnishing and interiors of the finished palace were reflective of that. Immediately upon completion, the king invited all 120 members of Lodge Le Progres de L&#x27;Oceanie to the palace for a lodge meeting. Kalākaua had also seen during his visit to Edison&#x27;s studio how effective electric lighting could be for the kingdom. On July 21, 1886, ʻIolani Palace led the way with the first electric lights in the kingdom, showcasing the technology. The monarch invited the public to attend a lighting ceremony on the palace grounds, attracting 5,000 spectators. The Royal Hawaiian Band entertained, refreshments were served, and the king paraded his troops around the grounds. The total cost of building and furnishing the new palace was $343,595.

===1883 coronation===
Kalākaua and Kapiʻolani had been denied a coronation ceremony in 1874 because of the civil unrest following the election. Under Finance Chairman Gibson, the 1880 legislature appropriated $10,000 for a coronation. Gibson was believed to be the main proponent behind the event. On October 10, 1882, the &quot;Saturday Press&quot; indicated that not all the public was in favor of the coronation. By this point, Gibson&#x27;s role in the kingdom&#x27;s finances and his influence on Kalākaua were beginning to come under scrutiny: &quot;Our versatile Premier ... is pulling another string in this puppet farce.&quot; At the same time, the newspaper rebuked many of the recent actions and policies not only of Gibson but of the King&#x27;s cabinet in general.

The coronation ceremony and related celebratory events were spread out over a two-week period. A special octagon-shaped pavilion and grandstand were built for the February 12, 1883, ceremony. Preparations were made for an anticipated crowd exceeding 5,000, with lawn chairs to accommodate any overflow. Before the actual event, a procession of 630 adults and children paraded from downtown to the palace. Kalākaua and Kapiʻolani, accompanied by their royal retinue, came out of the palace onto the event grounds. The coronation was preceded by a choir singing and the formal recitation of the King&#x27;s official titles. The news coverage noted, &quot;The King looked ill at ease.&quot; Chief Justice of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Supreme Court Albert Francis Judd officiated and delivered the oath of office to the king. The crown was then handed to Kalākaua, and he placed it upon his head. The ceremony ended with the choir singing, and a prayer. A planned post-coronation reception by Kalākaua and Kapiʻolani was cancelled without advance notice. Today, Kalākaua&#x27;s coronation pavilion serves as the bandstand for the Royal Hawaiian Band.

Following the ceremony, Kalākaua unveiled the Kamehameha Statue in front of Aliiolani Hale, the government building, with Gibson delivering the unveiling speech. This statue was a second replica. Originally intended for the centennial of Captain James Cook&#x27;s landing in Hawaiʻi, the statue, which was the brainchild of Gibson, had been cast by Thomas Ridgeway Gould but had been lost during shipment off the Falkland Islands. By the time the replica arrived, the intended date had passed, and it was decided to unveil the statue as part of the coronation ceremony. Later, the original statue was salvaged and restored. It was sent to Kohala, Hawaiʻi, Kamehameha&#x27;s birthplace, where it was unveiled by the king on May 8. The legislature had allocated $10,000 for the first statue and insured it for $12,000. A further $7,000 was allocated for the second statue with an additional $4,000 from the insurance money spent to add four bas relief panels depicting historic moments during Kamehamena&#x27;s reign.

That evening, the royal couple hosted a state dinner, and there was a luau at a later day. The hula was performed nightly on the palace grounds. Regattas, horse races and a number of events filled the celebration period. Due to weather conditions, the planned illumination of the palace and grounds for the day of the coronation happened a week later, and the public was invited to attend. Fireworks displays lit up the sky at the palace and at Punchbowl Crater. A grand ball was held the evening of February 20.

Although exact figures are unknown, historian Kuykendall stated that the final cost of the coronation exceeded $50,000.

===Kalākaua coinage===
The Kalākaua coinage was minted to boost Hawaiian pride. At this time, United States gold coins had been accepted for any debt over $50; any debt under $50 was payable by US silver coins. In 1880, the legislature passed a currency law that allowed it to purchase bullion for the United States mint to produce Hawaiʻi&#x27;s own coins. The design would have the King&#x27;s image on the obverse side, with Hawaiʻi&#x27;s coat of arms and motto &quot;Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono&quot; on the reverse. In a deal with Claus Spreckels, he sponsored the minting by purchasing the required silver. In return, he was guaranteed an equal amount of six percent gold bonds, thereby giving him a guaranteed profit.

When Hawaiʻi&#x27;s silver coins began circulating in December 1883, the business community was reluctant to accept them, fearing they would drive US gold coins out of the market. Spreckels opened his own bank to circulate them. Business owners feared economic inflation and lost faith in the government, as did foreign governments. Political fallout from the coinage led to the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. It passed the Currency Act to restrict acceptance of silver coins as payment for debts under $10. Exchange of silver for gold at the treasury was then limited to $150,000 a month. In 1903, the Hawaiʻi silver coins were redeemed for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.

===Birthday Jubilee, November 15–29, 1886===

Kalākaua&#x27;s 50th birthday on November 16, 1886, was celebrated with a two-week jubilee. Gibson had by this time joined the King&#x27;s cabinet as prime minister of Hawaiʻi. He and Minister of the Interior Luther Aholo put forth a motion for the legislature to form a committee to oversee the birthday jubilee on September 20. The motion was approved, and at Gibson&#x27;s subsequent request, the legislature appropriated $15,000 for the jubilee. An announcement was made on November 3 that all government schools would be closed the week of November 15.

Gifts for the king began arriving on November 15. At midnight, the jubilee officially began with fireworks at the Punchbowl Crater. At sunrise, the kingdom&#x27;s police force arrived at ʻIolani Palace to pay tribute, followed by the king&#x27;s Cabinet, Supreme Court justices, the kingdom&#x27;s diplomats, and officials of government departments. School student bodies and civic organizations also paid tribute. The Royal Hawaiian Band played throughout the day. In the afternoon, the doors of the palace were opened to all the officials and organizations, and the public. In the evening, the palace was aglow with lanterns, candles and electric lighting throwing &quot;a flood of radiance over the Palace and grounds&quot;. The evening ended with a Fireman&#x27;s Parade and fireworks. Throughout the next two weeks, there was a regatta, a Jubilee ball, a luau, athletic competitions, a state dinner, and a marksmanship contest won by the Honolulu Rifles. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; reported in 1891 that the final cost of the jubilee was $75,000.

=== Military policy ===

During the early part of his reign, Kalākaua restored the Household Guards which had been defunct since his predecessor Lunalilo abolished the unit in 1874. Initially, the king created three volunteer companies: the Leleiohoku Guard, a cavalry unit; the Prince&#x27;s Own, an artillery unit; and the Hawaiian Guards, an infantry unit. By the latter part of his reign, the army of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi consisted of six volunteer companies including the King&#x27;s Own, the Queen&#x27;s Own, the Prince&#x27;s Own, the Leleiohoku Guard, the Mamalahoa Guard and the Honolulu Rifles, and the regular troops of the King&#x27;s Household Guard. The ranks of these regiments were composed mainly of Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian officers with a few white officers including his brother-in-law John Owen Dominis. Each unit was subject to call for active service when necessary. The king and the governor of Oahu also had their own personal staff of military officers with the ranks of colonel and major.

On October 1, 1886, the &quot;Military Act of 1886&quot; was passed which created a Department of War and a Department of the Navy under the Minister of Foreign Affairs who would also serve as Secretary of War and of the Navy. Dominis was appointed lieutenant general and commander-in-chief and other officers were commissioned while the king was made the supreme commander and generalissimo of the Hawaiian Army. Around this time, the government also bought and commissioned His Hawaiian Majesty&#x27;s Ship (HHMS) &quot;Kaimiloa&quot;, the first and only vessel of the Hawaiian Royal Navy, under the command of Captain George E. Gresley Jackson.

After 1887, the military commissions creating Dominis and his staff officers were recalled for economic reasons and the &quot;Military Act of 1886&quot; was later declared unconstitutional. The &quot;Military Act of 1888&quot; was passed reducing the size of the army to the King&#x27;s Guards, a permanent force with a cap of 65 members, and five volunteer companies: the Honolulu Rifles, the King&#x27;s Own, the Queen&#x27;s Own, the Prince&#x27;s Own, and the Leleiohoku Guard. In 1890, another military act further restricted the army to just the King&#x27;s Royal Guards with a maximal recruitment of 36-100 men.

===Polynesian confederation===

The idea of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s involvement in the internal affairs of Polynesian nations had been around at least two decades before Kalākaua&#x27;s election, when Australian Charles St Julian volunteered to be a political liaison to Hawaiʻi in 1853. He accomplished nothing of any significance. Kalākaua&#x27;s interest in forming a Polynesian coalition, with him at the head, was influenced by both Walter M. Gibson and Italian soldier of fortune Celso Caesar Moreno. In 1879 Moreno urged the king to create such a realm with Hawaiʻi at the top of the empire by &quot; ... uniting under your sceptre the whole Polynesian race and make Honolulu a monarchical Washington, where the representatives of all the islands would convene in Congress.&quot;

In response to the activities of Germany and the United Kingdom in Oceania, Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; urged Hawaiʻi&#x27;s involvement in protecting the island nations from international aggression. Gibson was appointed to Kalākaua&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1882. In 1883, he introduced the approved legislation to convey in writing to foreign governments that Hawaiʻi fully supported the independence of Polynesian nations. The subsequent &quot;Hawaiian protest&quot; letter he drafted was mostly ignored by nations that received it. &quot;The Daily Bulletin&quot; in Honolulu issued its own response, &quot;Hawaiʻi&#x27;s true policy is to confine her attention to herself, ...&quot;. &quot;The Hawaiian Gazette&quot; criticized Gibson&#x27;s character and mockingly referred to the proposed venture as the &quot;Empire of the Calabash&quot;.
In 1885, Gibson dispatched Minister to the United States Henry A. P. Carter to Washington, D.C., and Europe to convey Hawaiʻi&#x27;s intentions towards Polynesia. Carter made little headway with Gibson&#x27;s instructions. He pushed for direct intervention into a political upheaval in Samoa, where the German Empire backed rebels under their leader Tamasese in an attempt to overthrow King Malietoa Laupepa. In an effort to keep him in power, Gibson convinced the 1886 legislature to allocate $100,000 to purchase the steamship &quot;Zealandia&quot;, $50,000 for its operating expenses, and $35,000 for foreign missions. United States special commissioner to Samoa, George H. Bates advised Kalākaua that Hawaiʻi should mind its own business and stay out of Samoan affairs. Instead, Hawaiʻi sent a delegation headed by John E. Bush to Samoa, where Samoan King Malietoa Laupepa signed a Samoan-Hawaiian confederation treaty on February 17, 1887. Bush also presented Malietoa with the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania, which Kalakaua had created to honor the monarchs and chiefs of the Polynesian confederation. The government sent HHMS &quot;Kaimiloa&quot; for Bush&#x27;s use in visiting the chiefs of the other islands of Polynesia.

The United States and the United Kingdom joined with Germany in expressing their disapproval of the treaty. Germany warned the United States and the United Kingdom, &quot;In case Hawaiʻi ... should try to interfere in favor of Malietoa, the King of the Sandwich Islands would thereby enter into [a] state of war with us.&quot; When German warships arrived in Samoan waters, Malietoa surrendered and was sent into exile. The &quot;Kaimiloa&quot; and Bush&#x27;s delegation were recalled to Honolulu after the ousting of the Gibson administration. Kalākaua&#x27;s later explanation of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s interference in Samoa was, &quot;Our Mission was simply a Mission of phylanthropy [&quot;sic&quot;] more than any thing, but the arogance [&quot;sic&quot;] of the Germans prevented our good intentions and . . . we had to withdraw the Mission.&quot;

==1887 Bayonet Constitution==

In &quot;Memoirs of the Hawaiian Revolution&quot;, Sanford B. Dole devoted a chapter to the Bayonet Constitution. He stated that King Kalākaua appointed cabinet members not for their ability to do the job, but for their ability to bend to his will. Consequently, according to Dole, appropriated funds were shifted from one account to another, &quot;for fantastic enterprises and for the personal aggrandizement of the royal family.&quot; Dole placed much of the blame on Gibson, and accused Kalākaua of taking a bribe of $71,000 from Tong Kee to grant an opium license, an action done via one of the king&#x27;s political allies Junius Kaʻae.

Despite his own personal opposition, Kalākaua signed a legislative bill in 1886 creating a single opium vending and distribution license. Kaʻae had suggested to rice planter Tong Kee, also known as Aki, that a monetary gift to the king might help him acquire it. Aki took the suggestion and gave thousands of dollars to the king. Another merchant, Chun Lung, made the government an offer of $80,000.00 which forced Aki to raise even more cash. The license was eventually awarded to Chun who withheld his payment until the license was actually signed over to him on December 31, 1886. Kalākaua admitted that he had been overruled by his cabinet who were friendly with Chun. After the reform party took control of the government, the opium license debt remained unpaid. Kalākaua agreed to make restitution for his debts via revenues from the Crown Lands. However, other liabilities and outstanding debt forced him to sign his debt over to trustees who would control all of Kalākaua&#x27;s private estates and Crown Land revenues. When trustees refused to add the opium debt, Aki sued. Although the court ruled, &quot;The king could do no wrong&quot;, the trustees were found liable for the debt.

The Hawaiian League was formed to change the status quo of government &quot;by all means necessary&quot;, and had joined forces with the Honolulu Rifles militia group. Anticipating a coup d&#x27;état, the king took measures to save himself by dismissing Gibson and his entire cabinet on June 28. Fearing an assassination was not out of the question, Kalākaua barricaded himself inside the palace. The Hawaiian League presented a June 30 resolution demanding the king&#x27;s restitution for the alleged bribe. Also known as the &quot;committee of thirteen&quot;, it was composed of: Paul Isenberg, William W. Hall, James A. Kennedy, William Hyde Rice, Captain James A. King, E. B. Thomas, H. C. Reed, John Mark Vivas, W. P. A. Brewer, Rev. W. B. Oleson, Cecil Brown, Captain George Ross and Joseph Ballard Atherton.

The newly appointed cabinet members were William Lowthian Green as prime minister and minister of finance, Clarence W. Ashford as attorney general, Lorrin A. Thurston as minister of the interior, and Godfrey Brown as minister of foreign affairs.

A new constitution was drafted immediately by the Hawaiian Committee and presented to Kalākaua for his signature on July 6. The next day he issued a proclamation of the abrogation of the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The new constitution was nicknamed the Bayonet Constitution because of the duress under which it was signed. His sister Liliuokalani stated in &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Story&quot; that her brother was convinced that if he did not sign, he would be assassinated. She wrote that he no longer knew who was friend or foe. He felt betrayed by people he once trusted and had told her that everywhere he went he was under constant surveillance.

The Bayonet Constitution allowed the King to appoint his cabinet but placed that cabinet under the sole authority of the legislature. It required any executive actions of the monarch to be approved by the cabinet. Previous suffrage (voting rights) was restricted to male subjects of the kingdom regardless of race. The new constitution restricted suffrage only to Hawaiian, American or European men residing in Hawaii, if they were 21 years old, literate with no back unpaid taxes, and would take an oath to support the law of the land. By placing a new minimum qualifier of $3,000 in property ownership and a minimum income of $600 for voters of the House of Nobles, the new constitution disqualified many poor Native Hawaiians from voting for half of the legislature. Naturalized Asians were deprived of the vote for both houses of the legislature.

Gibson was arrested on July 1 and charged with embezzlement of public funds. The case was soon dropped for lack of evidence. Gibson fled to California on July 12, and died there 6 months later on January 21, 1888.

When the new constitution went into effect, state-sponsored students studying abroad were recalled. One of those was Robert William Wilcox who had been sent to Italy for military training. Wilcox&#x27;s initial reaction to the turn of events was advocating Liliuokalani be installed as Regent. On July 30, 1889, however, he and Robert Napuʻuako Boyd, another state-sponsored student, led a rebellion aimed at restoring the 1864 constitution, and, thereby, the king&#x27;s power. Kalākaua, possibly fearing Wilcox intended to force him to abdicate in favor of his sister, was not in the palace when the insurrection happened. The government&#x27;s military defense led to the surrender of the Wilcox&#x27;s insurgents.

==Death and succession==

Kalākaua sailed for California aboard the USS &quot;Charleston&quot; on November 25, 1890. Accompanying him were his trusted friends George W. Macfarlane and Robert Hoapili Baker. There was uncertainty about the purpose of the king&#x27;s trip. Minister of Foreign Affairs John Adams Cummins reported the trip was solely for the king&#x27;s health and would not extend beyond California. Local newspapers and British commissioner Wodehouse worried the king might go farther east to Washington, D.C., to negotiate a continued cession of Pearl Harbor to the United States after the expiration of the reciprocity treaty or possible annexation of the kingdom. His sister Liliʻuokalani, after unsuccessfully dissuading him from departing, wrote he meant to discuss the McKinley Tariff with the Hawaiian ambassador to the United States HenryA.P.Carter in Washington. She was again appointed to serve as regent during his absence.

Upon arriving in California, the party landed in San Francisco on December 5. Kalākaua, whose health had been declining, stayed in a suite at the Palace Hotel. Traveling throughout Southern California and Northern Mexico, he suffered a minor stroke in Santa Barbara and was rushed back to San Francisco. He was placed under the care of George W. Woods, surgeon of the United States Pacific Fleet. Against the advice of Dr. Woods, Kalākaua insisted on going to his initiation at the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (A.A.O.N.M.S.) on January 14. He was given a tonic of Vin Mariani that got him on his feet, and was accompanied to the rites by an escort from the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. The ceremonies did not take long, and he was returned to his suite within an hour. Two days before his death, he lapsed into a coma. Kalākaua died at 2:35 pm on Tuesday, January 20, 1891. US Navy officials listed the official cause of death as Bright&#x27;s Disease (inflammation of the kidneys).

His last words were, &quot;Aue, he kanaka au, eia i loko o ke kukonukonu o ka maʻi!,&quot; or &quot;Alas, I am a man who is seriously ill.&quot; The more popular quote, &quot;Tell my people I tried&quot;, attributed as his last words, was actually invented by novelist Eugene Burns in his 1952 biography of Kalākaua, &quot;The Last King of Paradise&quot;. Shortly before his death, his voice was recorded on a phonograph cylinder, which is now in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum.

The news of Kalākaua&#x27;s death did not reach Hawaiʻi until January 29 when the &quot;Charleston&quot; returned to Honolulu with the king&#x27;s remains. As his designated heir-apparent, Liliuokalani ascended to the throne the same day.

After a state funeral in California and a second one in Honolulu, the king&#x27;s remains were buried in the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna ʻAla on February 15, 1891. In a ceremony officiated by his sister Liliʻuokalani on June 24, 1910, his remains, and those of his family, were transferred to the underground Kalākaua Crypt after the main mausoleum building had been converted into a chapel.

==Legacy==
Kalākaua&#x27;s reign is generally regarded as the first Hawaiian Renaissance, for both his influence on Hawaiʻi&#x27;s music, and for other contributions he made to reinvigorate Hawaiian culture. His actions inspired the reawakening Hawaiian pride and nationalism for the kingdom.

During the earlier reign of Christian convert Kaʻahumanu, dancing the hula was forbidden and punishable by law. Subsequent monarchs gradually began allowing the hula, but it was Kalākaua who brought it back in full force. Chants, meles and the hula were part of the official entertainment at Kalākaua&#x27;s coronation and his birthday jubilee. He issued an invitation to all Hawaiians with knowledge of the old mele and chants to participate in the coronation, and arranged for musicologist A. Marques to observe the celebrations. Kalākaua&#x27;s cultural legacy lives on in the Merrie Monarch Festival, a large-scale annual hula competition in Hilo, Hawaiʻi, begun in 1964 and named in his honor. A composer of the ancient chants or mele, for the first time Kalākaua published a written version of the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;, a 2,102-line chant that had traditionally been passed down orally. It traces the royal lineage and the creation of the cosmos. He is also known to have revived the Hawaiian martial art of Lua, and surfing.

The Hawaiian Board of Health (different from the governmental Board of Health) passed by the 1886 legislature consisted of five Native Hawaiians, appointed by Kalākaua, who oversaw the licensing and regulation of the traditional practice of native healing arts. He also appointed Emma Kaili Metcalf Beckley Nakuina as the first Native Hawaiian curator of the Hawaiian National Museum and increased funding for the institution.

In 1886, Kalākaua had his Privy Council license the ancient Hale Nauā Society for persons of Hawaiian ancestry. The original Hale Naua had not been active since Kamehameha I, when it had functioned as a genealogical research organization for claims of royal lineage. When Kalākaua reactivated it, he expanded its purpose to encompass Hawaiian culture as well as modern-day arts and sciences and included women as equals. The ranks of the society grew to more than 200 members, and was a political support for Kalākaua that lasted until his death in 1891. In 2004, the National Museum of Natural History displayed Kalākaua&#x27;s red-and-yellow feathered Hale Naua &quot;ʻahuʻula&quot; and feathered &quot;kāhili&quot; as part of its Hawaiian special exhibit.

Kalākaua&#x27;s sponsorship of and a brief career in the Hawaiian language press gave him the additional epithet of the &quot;Editor King&quot;. From 1861 to 1863, Kalākaua with G. W. Mila, J. W. H. Kauwahi and John K. Kaunamano co-edited &quot;Ka Hoku o ka Pakipika&quot; (&quot;The Star of the Pacific&quot;), the first Hawaiian language newspaper solely written by Native Hawaiians without the influence of American missionaries. This nationalist paper focused on Hawaiian topics especially traditional folklore and poetry. In 1870 he also edited the daily newspaper &quot;Ka Manawa&quot; (&quot;Times&quot;), which concerned itself with international news, local news and genealogies but only lasted for two months. He also sponsored the literary journal, &quot;Ka Hoku o Ke Kai&quot; (&quot;The Star of the Sea&quot;), which ran from 1883 to 1884.

The Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame honored Kalākaua and his brother and sisters as &quot;Na Lani ʻEhā&quot; (&quot;The Heavenly Four&quot;) for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s musical culture and history. &quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot; was officially designated the Hawaiʻi state anthem in 1967. Originally titled &quot;Hymn to KamehamehaI&quot;, Henri Berger, leader of the Royal Hawaiian Band, wrote the instrumental melody in 1872, influenced by the Prussian anthem &quot;Heil dir im Siegerkranz&quot;. Kalākaua added the lyrics in 1874, and the Kawaiahaʻo Church Choir sang it on his birthday that year. In 1876, it became the official anthem of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi until the overthrow of the monarchy. Other works by the king include &quot;Sweet Lei Lehua&quot;, &quot;ʻAkahi Hoʻi&quot;, &quot;E Nihi Ka Hele&quot;, &quot;Ka Momi&quot;, and &quot;Koni Au I Ka Wai&quot;. Seven of his songs were published in &quot;Ka Buke O Na Leo Mele Hawaii&quot; (1888) using the pseudonym &quot;Figgs&quot;. He generally wrote only the lyrics for most of his surviving works.

He established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Serbia and was awarded the Order of Cross of Takovo.
The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian islands during the reign of Kalākaua, by Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. The king became proficient on the instrument. According to American journalist Mary Hannah Krout and Hawaiʻi resident Isobel Osbourne Strong, wife of artist Joseph Dwight Strong and stepdaughter of Robert Louis Stevenson, he would often play the ukulele and perform meles for his visitors, accompanied by his personal musical group Kalākaua&#x27;s Singing Boys (aka King&#x27;s Singing Boys). Strong recalled the Singing Boys as &quot;the best singers and performers on the ukulele and guitar in the whole islands&quot;. Kalākaua was inducted into the Ukulele Hall of Fame in 1997.

Kalākaua Avenue was created in March 1905 by the House and Senate of the Hawaiʻi Territorial Legislature. It renamed the highway known as Waikiki Road, &quot;to commemorate the name of his late Majesty Kalākaua, during whose reign Hawaiʻi made great advancement in material prosperity&quot;.

The King David Kalakaua Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 under its former name U.S. Post Office, Customhouse, and Courthouse. Located at 335 Merchant Street in Honolulu, it was once the official seat of administration for the Territory of Hawaiʻi. The building was renamed for Kalākaua in 2003.

In 1985, a bronze statue of Kalākaua was donated to the City and County of Honolulu to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the arrival of the first Japanese laborers after the king&#x27;s visit to Japan. It was commissioned by the Oahu Kanyaku Imin Centennial Committee on behalf of the Japanese-American community of Hawaiʻi. The statue was designed and created by musician Palani Vaughan, architect Leland Onekea and Native Hawaiian sculptor Sean Kekamakupaa Kaonohiokalani Lee Loy Browne. It is located at the corner of Kalākaua and Kuhio avenues in Waikiki. 

In 1988, a cast bronze statue titled &quot;King David Kalākaua&quot; was placed in Kalakaua Park in Hilo, Hawai&#x27;i (57&quot; H). It was created by Hawaiian artist Henry Bianchini. 

A Hawaiian song about Kalākaua can be heard in the Disney movie &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; when Lilo is introduced in the movie. The mele was written as a &quot;mele inoa&quot;, its original title being &quot;He Inoa No Kalani Kalākaua Kulele&quot; (a namesong for the chief, Kalākaua). On the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; soundtrack, it was retitled as &quot;He Mele No Lilo&quot;.

<text>Beacon station is a commuter rail station on the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line located in Beacon, New York. The station has three tracks, with one island platform and one side platform.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Rail service in Beacon can be traced as far back as December 6, 1849, with the Hudson River Railroad. The station was originally named &quot;Fishkill Landing,&quot; and like many others on the Hudson Line, it is also right on the Hudson River. On September 4, 1866, the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad was established with the hope of running from the south side of Fishkill Creek northeast and north to meet the New York and Harlem Railroad at Craryville, New York. This junction and the station were built south of Fishkill Landing, and would be known forever as Dutchess Junction. The first station at Dutchess Junction, which was shared by the NYC&amp;HR and D&amp;C was burned down in April 1876, and rebuilt. The railroad along the river was acquired by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in November 1869. By 1877, the D&amp;C was taken over by the Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad. In 1881 the New York and New England Railroad built a ferry port near Fishkill Landing station, and added a connecting spur along the north side of the Fishkill Creek (now known as the Beacon Secondary) leading to what became Wickopee Junction, and turned it over to the ND&amp;C.

Dutchess Junction station would face another fire in 1893, and was replaced by little more than a sheltered shed which lasted only into the 1950s. The New York and New England ferry terminal was bought by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, along with the rest of the NY&amp;NE in 1898.

=== 20th century ===
In 1905 the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad acquired the ND&amp;C, and in 1907 merged it into the Central New England Railway, which itself was acquired by the New Haven Railroad system in 1904, and allowed to operate under its own name until 1927. In the meantime the NYC&amp;HR became the New York Central Railroad System in 1914.

Between 1913 and 1915, the original HRR line was realigned, and the station was rebuilt in order to accommodate both the Hudson Division of the New York Central Railroad and the connecting spur of the ND&amp;C along the north side of Fishkill Creek. Since Fishkill Landing was consolidated into the City of Beacon in 1913, the new station would be called Beacon as well. Additionally, the station also contained a new ferry dock designed for trains, passengers, and eventually cars. By 1916, the ND&amp;C was moved from the southeast side of Fishkill Creek to the north side of the creek, and the original section between Dutchess Junction and Wickopee Junction was gradually abandoned in the 1930s. The New Haven Railroad continued to gradually reduce service along the ND&amp;C, although they never completely eliminated service. In 1930 the ferry route officially became part of New York State Route 52.

The decline in railroad service during the post-WW II era affected Beacon station as it did with much of the country, but other forces also put the station at risk. Winter freezes along the Hudson (including one that stranded a ferry boat in the Hudson River), and the construction of the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge brought ferry service at the station to an end. New York Central merged with their long time rival Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Railroad, then acquired the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1969, including the former ND&amp;C. Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in 1971, but Beacon station continued to serve only Penn Central Hudson Line commuter trains which by that time ran to Poughkeepsie and was subsidized by the MTA beginning in 1972. A fire in 1976 destroyed the station built by New York Central in 1913, which was demolished later that year to create more parking capacity. Conrail took over Penn Central in 1976 continued to operate Hudson Line trains until Metro-North Commuter Railroad assumed operation in 1983.

=== 21st century ===
On October 17, 2005, ferry service to the station from Newburgh resumed after 42 years in which the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge had sufficed to bring people across the river. This has allowed the MTA to essentially increase the available parking for the station with little new construction due to the availability of land on the Newburgh waterfront. The fare is $1.75 per person each way; unlike Beacon, parking in Newburgh is free. Those purchasing monthly train passes also have the option to include the Newburgh-Beacon ferry in their ticket. Rail and ferry service at Beacon was severely disrupted by Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but not obliterated.

On March 27, 2023, the Track 3 side platform opened for passenger service after a full reconstruction, and is accessible from the south end of the eastern parking lot, including via ADA-compliant ramps. Track 3 had a temporary platform built during a renovation project in the 1990s, though it was removed when the project was completed; the new platform was built atop the preexisting support structure.

<text>Gymea is a suburb in southern Sydney, Australia. Gymea is 26 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. The postcode is 2227, which it shares with adjacent suburb Gymea Bay.

==History==
The Gymea Lily, &quot;Doryanthes excelsa&quot; is a 6 m tall perennial that is prevalent in the area. It was named by the local Dharawal people as &quot;kai&#x27;mia&quot; in the Dharawal language. This word became the inspiration for the suburb&#x27;s name, by government surveyor W.A.B. Geaves in 1855. The Gymea Lily has been adopted as a symbol of the area and features on the crest of many local organisations. Development in the area has eradicated most of the lilies but many can still be found, a few kilometres south, in the Royal National Park.

By the 1920s steam trams operated between Cronulla and Sutherland, via Gymea. The railway station on the line to Cronulla opened in 1939.

Gymea experienced substantial development after World War II. The influx of migrants, particularly from Europe and the baby boom, contributed to the demand for housing and infrastructure. The Australian government&#x27;s push for suburbanization and increasing accessibility of automobiles led to Gymea becoming an attractive place for families looking for more affordable housing outside of the city area. The 1950s and 1960s saw Gymea&#x27;s conversion from a rural area to a bustling residential community. As more homes were built, local amenities such as schools, shopping centres and recreational facilities also began to be established. Gymea&#x27;s proximity to beaches, parks and the Royal National Park made it a popular location for residents seeking a suburban lifestyle with access to nature. Its development of infrastructure, such as improved roads, transport links and the establishment of commercial areas, helped solidify its place as a key suburb in the Sutherland Shire. Gymea&#x27;s population grew, becoming more connected to the greater Sydney area.

In the 1970s, Gymea continued to attract new families and retirees, becoming a thriving suburb. The post-war period was essential in shaping Gymea into a community, moving away from its rural roots toward a modern, residential suburb known for its mix of natural beauty and urban convenience.

==Population==
In the 2021 census there were 8219 people in Gymea. 76.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.0%, China 1.5% and New Zealand 1.5%. 82.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 1.7%, Greek 1.4% and Cantonese 1.3%. The most common responses for religion in were No Religion 35.7%, Catholic 27.2% and Anglican 16.0%.

==Commercial area==
Gymea is primarily a low-density residential suburb. Located close to Gymea railway station, the suburb&#x27;s shopping strip is known as Gymea Shopping Village. Over the last decade it has become a popular shopping and &#x27;café culture&#x27; district with many cafés, restaurants, boutiques and gourmet food shops opened along Gymea Bay Road. The Gymea Hotel is also located on Gymea Bay Road. It was opened in 1959 and was originally called the Gymea Rex Hotel.

==Transport==
Gymea railway station is on the Cronulla branch of the Illawarra railway line, part of the Sydney Trains network, which provides regular rail services to the city. Gymea railway station is on Gymea Bay Road, in the middle of the main shopping area. Adjacent stations are Kirrawee and Miranda. Private buses, principally operated by U-Go Mobility also service the local area and provide school student transport.

==Education==
The suburb has one public primary school, Gymea North Public School; a Catholic primary school, St Catherine Labouré Primary; a secondary school, Gymea Technology High School; and the Sydney Montessori School for pre-primary, primary and secondary students. Many children in Gymea attend schools in Gymea Bay, especially Gymea Bay Public School(the largest primary school in the Sutherland Shire), and Kirrawee. Gymea is also home to a campus of the Sydney Institute of TAFE.

==Churches==
* St Paul&#x27;s and St Barnabas Anglican Church
* St Catherine Labouré Catholic Church
* St Stylianos Greek Orthodox Church (officially known as St Stylianos, Saints Peter and Paul, St Gregory of Palamas) 

==Culture==

===Art===
Gymea is home to the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre, which features art galleries, art studios, a theatrette, gardens, meeting rooms, gallery shop and café. A number of special events are held at the gallery throughout the year.

===Sport===
Like many suburbs in the Sutherland Shire, Gymea maintains an active culture of youth sport and has well-established cricket, rugby league, swimming (Gymea Bay Amateur Swimming Club), football (Gymea United FC, which is currently the largest club in the Oceania region), and netball clubs.

===Pop culture===
Australian writer Scot McPhie named his podcast and collection of poetry published in 1999 &#x27;Gymea&#x27;, after living near the suburb in the 1990s. 2SSR broadcasts from Gymea TAFE.

===Events===
* The Gymea Village Fair is held every year in the last Sunday in October. The streets are closed for stalls, arts and crafts, rides and music.

===Plant Nursery===
The Sutherland Shire Council&#x27;s Plant Nursery, with local plants propagated by Bushcare volunteers, is in Gymea. Plants are available for revegetation and landscaping.

<doc id="556712" wikidata="Q847247" url="?curid=556712" title="New South Wales Corps">
<text>The New South Wales Corps, later known as the 102d Regiment of Foot, and lastly as the 100th Regiment of Foot, was a formation of the British Army organised in 1789 in England to relieve the New South Wales Marine Corps, which had accompanied the First Fleet to New South Wales. In Australia, the New South Wales Corps gained notoriety for its trade in rum and mutinous behaviour. 

Reconstituted as the 102d Regiment of Foot, it was transferred to Bermuda and Nova Scotia, before taking part in the Chesapeake campaign of the War of 1812. Reconstituted for the second time after the war as the 100th Regiment of Foot, it was disbanded in 1818.

== History ==
=== Formation ===

In June 1789, the regiment was formed in England as a permanent unit to relieve the New South Wales Marine Corps, who had accompanied the First Fleet to Australia. The regiment began arriving as guards on the Second Fleet in 1790. The regiment, led by Major Francis Grose, consisted of three companies, numbering about 300 men. Although drafts were sent from Britain to reinforce the regiment throughout its time in Australia, its full strength never exceeded 500.
A fourth company was raised from those Marines wishing to remain in New South Wales under Captain George Johnston, who had been Governor Arthur Phillip&#x27;s aide-de-camp.

In December 1792, when Phillip returned to England for respite, Grose was left in charge. Grose immediately abandoned Phillip&#x27;s plans for governing the colony. A staunch military man, he established military rule and set out to secure the authority of the Corps. He abolished the civilian courts and transferred the magistrates to the authority of Captain Joseph Foveaux. 

After the poor crops of 1793 he cut the rations of the convicts but not those of the Corps, overturning Phillip&#x27;s policy of equal rations for all. In a connived attempt to improve agricultural production and make the colony more self-sufficient, Grose turned away from collective farming and made generous land grants to officers of the Corps. They were also provided with government-fed and clothed convicts as farm labour.

=== Rum trading===
Grose also relaxed Phillip&#x27;s prohibition on trading of rum, sometimes a generic term for any form of distilled beverage, usually made from wheat, commonly from Bengal. The colony, like many British territories at the time, was short of coins, and rum soon became the medium of trade. The officers of the Corps were able to use their position and wealth to buy all the imported rum and then exchange it for goods and labour at very favourable rates, earning the Corps the nickname &quot;The Rum Corps&quot;. By 1793 stills were being imported and grain was being used to make rum, exacerbating the shortage of grain.

Due to poor health Grose returned to England in December 1794 and Captain William Paterson assumed temporary command until a permanent replacement, Governor John Hunter, arrived in September 1795. Paterson had obtained his commission with the backing of Sir Joseph Banks because he was interested in natural history and would explore and collect samples for Banks and the Royal Society.

Governor Hunter attempted unsuccessfully to use the troops of the Corps to guard imported rum and stop the officers from buying it up. Attempts to stop the importation were also thwarted by the failure of other governments to co-operate and by the Corps&#x27; officers chartering of a Danish ship to bring in a large shipment of rum from India. Hunter also tried to start up a public store with goods from England to provide competition and stabilise the price of goods, but Hunter was not a good businessman and supplies were too erratic.

Hunter requested greater control by authorities in England and an excise duty on rum. He issued an order restricting the amount of convict labour that officers could use, but again had no means to enforce it. Hunter was strongly opposed by officers of the Corps, and pamphlets and letters against him were circulated. John Macarthur wrote a letter accusing Hunter of ineffectiveness and trading in rum. Hunter was required by the Colonial Office to answer the charges, and soon after was recalled for being ineffective.

In 1799 Paterson, now a Lieutenant Colonel, returned from England with orders to stamp out the trading in rum by officers of the Corps. In 1800, he charged Major George Johnston, who had served as Hunter&#x27;s aide-de-camp, with giving a sergeant part payment in rum at an exorbitant rate. Johnston claimed he was being unfairly persecuted and demanded that he be sent to England for trial. The English courts decided that colonial affairs were not a matter for them and, as all the evidence and witnesses were in Sydney, that any trial should be held there. They decided that, as proper court martial could not be constituted in Sydney, no further action should be taken against Johnston.

Governor Philip King, appointed in September 1800, continued Hunter&#x27;s efforts to prevent the Corps trading in rum. He had the power to levy an excise duty on alcohol, and the Transit Board now required all ships to lodge a bond which was forfeit for disobeying the Governor&#x27;s orders, which included the prohibition of the landing of more than 500 gallons of rum. King also encouraged private importers and traders, opened a public brewery in 1804, and introduced a schedule of values for Indian copper and Spanish pieces of eight which were used as currency. There was still a serious problem keeping the coin in the colony, despite it being valued higher than its face value. King&#x27;s actions were not wholly effective but they still antagonised officers of the Corps. Like Hunter, he was the subject of pamphlets and attacks. King tried, unsuccessfully, to court-martial the officers responsible.

=== Vinegar Hill uprising ===

The Corps were called into action responding to the Vinegar Hill uprising, named after a revolt in Ireland. Late on 4 March 1804, a great number of Irish rebels rose up at the government farm at Castle Hill, armed themselves with muskets and pikes from surrounding farms, and planned to sack Parramatta and take Sydney Town. Some say they then intended to take ships and sail back to Ireland. Others say the intention was to declare the Republic of New Ireland two weeks later on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. 

An alarm at around 11pm raised Major Johnston from his sleep. He then led 29 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps on a forced march from their barracks at Annandale to Parramatta. They arrived around dawn. Later in the morning, with 50 militia of the Loyal Volunteers, they pursued the rebels who were now heading to Green Hills, today&#x27;s Windsor. 

At a feigned meeting with the rebels aided by a priest as a lure, Johnston took the ringleaders hostage. When they and their men refused to surrender, to the shouts of &#x27;death or liberty&#x27; the troops quickly put down the revolt. Over the next three days, repercussions and summary justice reigned. Governor King highly commended Major Johnston for his actions, even though King had to intervene directly to stop a military kangaroo court from hanging one in ten of the rebels. At midnight on 4 March, Captain Daniel Woodriff of landed 150 of his crew to assist the New South Wales Corps and Governor King.

=== Rum Rebellion ===

Governor King had been requesting a replacement, for at least a year. In 1805, Governor William Bligh was appointed. Although the economy had developed and diversified somewhat by 1806, Bligh arrived determined to bring the Corps, and especially John Macarthur, to heel, and stop their trading in rum. This led to the Rum Rebellion, the deposing of Bligh, and the eventual recall of the New South Wales Corps.

In 1808, the New South Wales Corps was renamed the 102d Regiment of Foot. Having arrived in the colony in December 1809 with the 73rd Regiment of Foot, which was to take over from the 102d Regiment of Foot, Governor Lachlan Macquarie was able to control the rum trade more effectively, introducing and enforcing a licensing system.

Due to the lack of currency, he was still forced to pay for public works in rum. The construction of Sydney Hospital was entirely funded by granting a monopoly on the import of rum to the contractors, who were the merchants Alexander Riley and Garnham Blaxcell. The colonial surgeon D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, and troops were used to prohibit the landing of rum anywhere but at the hospital dock.

A few of the officers and long-serving privates in the 102d Regiment were transferred to Macquarie&#x27;s 73rd regiment, bringing it up to near full strength. About 100 veterans and invalids were retained for garrison duty in New South Wales.

=== War of 1812 ===
Most members of the 102d Regiment of Foot embarked for England in May 1810. Upon arrival, a majority went to veteran or garrison battalions, most officers ending up in the 8th Royal Veteran Battalion. The regiment was reconstituted with new recruits after it arrived at its new base in Horsham in October 1810. It was sent to Guernsey in July 1811. The regiment was posted to the Bermuda Garrison, stationed at St. George&#x27;s Garrison in 1812, this being part of the Nova Scotia Command, co-inciding with the start of the War of 1812.
In 1813, Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir Thomas Sydney Beckwith arrived in Bermuda to command a force tasked with raiding the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States, specifically in the region of Chesapeake Bay, with the 102d Regiment&#x27;s Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles James Napier, as his Second-in-Command. Beckwith split the force into two brigades. One, was the 102d Regiment, Royal Marines from the Bermudian naval base, and two companies recruited from French prisoners-of-war that had been sent to reinforce the Bermuda garrison, was under Napier&#x27;s command, and the other under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams of the Royal Marines. Embarking aboard naval vessels engaged on the American coast on the 8 June 1813, they took part in the Battle of Craney Island on 22 June 1813.

After carrying out raids on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and minus the two companies of Frenchmen, they left the Chesapeake and landed at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 20 September 1813. The Royal Marine battalion and Royal Marine Artillery were to go to Quebec under the command of Beckwith, leaving Napier a brigade of 1,000 infantry and three artillery pieces. It had been proposed to move the 102d to operations in the American south, but this was not carried out. Napier transferred by exchange to the 50th Regiment of Foot in September 1813.

Detachments of the 102d Regiment of Foot remained on both sides of the border between the British colony of New Brunswick and the U.S. state of Maine after the war&#x27;s end in December 1814 at Moose Island, modern day Eastport, Maine, United States. The Treaty of Ghent was signed on 24 December 1814 by the negotiators, ratified by the Prince Regent on 27 December, and by the United States President on 17 February, ending the war. After three years at New Brunswick, it embarked in the autumn of 1817 to return to England under the command of Major Gustavus Rochford.

After the end of the wars against Napoleonic France and the United States, the British Army disbanded many units for the sake of economy. The regiment was reorganized as the 100th Regiment of Foot in 1816. The regiment was the last British unit to occupy the United States; the last detachments returned to Chatham in England, where the regiment was disbanded on 24 March 1818.

== Commanding officers ==
The regiment&#x27;s commanding officers were:&lt;br&gt;New South Wales Corps

* Major Francis Grose (1789–94)
* Lieutenant Colonel William Paterson (1794–1809)

102d Regiment of Foot

* Lieutenant Colonel William Paterson (1809–10)
* Major George Johnston (1810–11)
* Lieutenant Colonel Charles James Napier (1811–1813)
* Major Gustavus Rochford (1813–1818)

== Officers who became prominent colonists ==
Many of the regiment&#x27;s officers became wealthy and powerful individuals from their corrupt practices while in control of the colony. These officers and their descendants went on to become prominent colonists, government officials and land-holders in Australia. Examples are:

* Captain John Macarthur: pioneer of the Merino wool industry in Australia, founder of the Australian Agricultural Company, and large landowner at Camden.
* Captain William Cox: builder of the road across the Blue Mountains, important pastoralist in the Hawkesbury and Bathurst regions.
* Captain John Piper: significant land-holder in Sydney and Bathurst.
* Captain Edward Abbott: important colonist of Tasmania.
* Lieutenant William Lawson: explorer across the Blue Mountains and prominent land-holder in the Mudgee region.
* Lieutenant Anthony Fenn Kemp: significant colonist of Tasmania.
* Lieutenant Archibald Bell Sr.: important landowner in the Hawkesbury region.
* Surgeon John Harris: extensive property owner in Sydney and the Bathurst region.
* Lieutenant Nicholas Bayly: large land-holder in Cabramatta region.

<doc id="556713" wikidata="Q1325921" url="?curid=556713" title="Electric Café">
<text>Electric Café is the ninth studio album by German electronic band Kraftwerk, released on 27 October 1986. The initial 1986 release came in versions sung in English and German, as well as a limited &quot;Edición Española&quot; release, featuring versions of &quot;Techno Pop&quot; and &quot;Sex Object&quot; with only Spanish lyrics. It was the first Kraftwerk LP to be created using predominantly digital musical instruments, although the finished product was still recorded onto analog master tapes.

On 2 October 2009, the album was remastered and re-released under its original working title, Techno Pop.

==Background and development==
The development of the album began in early 1982 (with the working titles of &quot;Technicolor&quot; and then &quot;Techno Pop&quot;), but the project was delayed because Ralf Hütter suffered a cycling accident in May or June 1982.

EMI Records announced a release date for the &quot;Techno Pop&quot; album. Promotional advertisements were released and official catalog numbers were assigned to the project. &quot;We were working on an album concept, &quot;Technopop&quot;, but the composition was developed and we just changed the titles&quot;, Hütter explained. &quot;It became &quot;Electric Café&quot;. But somebody within the record company went out and did a pre-order, we were working on the sleeve and some marketing idiot did this&quot;.

At various times, Hütter, Bartos, Flür and Schneider have each stated in interviews that there are no unreleased songs from this period, and that all of the original &quot;Technicolor&quot; and &quot;Techno Pop&quot; material was eventually reworked into what can be heard on the finished &quot;Electric Café&quot; album. Hütter commented &quot;We don&#x27;t spend our time on making 20 versions of a song only to leave 19 in the closet. We work target related. What we are starting we release. Our storage is empty.&quot;

==Composition==

The first side of the album is divided into three tracks, which form a suite of three variations with recurring elements. (For instance, a few bars of melody from &quot;Musique Non-Stop&quot; can be heard as a few bars of bass melody in &quot;Techno Pop&quot;). It is primarily instrumental, utilizing the track titles and other phrases in a spoken manner, as opposed to sung, narrative lyrics. The songs &quot;Techno Pop&quot; and &quot;Sex Object&quot; feature partial Spanish-language lyrics. The second side also contains three songs, following a somewhat more conventional pop format.

The song &quot;The Telephone Call&quot; (German version: &quot;Der Telefon-Anruf&quot;) is notable for being the first and only Kraftwerk song to feature Karl Bartos on lead vocals. The album closes with the title track &quot;Electric Café&quot;, which features French and partially Italian-language lyrics. The track gained some exposure in the United States when it was used slightly sped up as the theme song for &quot;Sprockets&quot;, the German television spoof by Mike Myers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Critical reception==

While recognising Kraftwerk&#x27;s influence on groups such as Depeche Mode and the Human League, journalist Ian Cranna writing in &quot;Smash Hits&quot; described the album as &quot;frankly rather dull&quot; adding &quot;one can only assume it&#x27;s an exercise for their own amusement&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; in their review of the 2009 remaster wrote that &quot;Techno Pop can only be seen as a flop, despite the intermittent brilliance of its opening section.&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic in his retrospective review of the album commented that &quot;the record&#x27;s short running time (less than 36 minutes) seems to indicate a lack of ideas and new directions with the spartan opening tracks, &quot;Technopop&quot; and &quot;Music Non-Stop&quot;.

==Track listing==
Notes:
* In Spain the album was released in two versions. One was the regular English/International edition, and the other a local &quot;Edición Española&quot; version, appearing early in 1987, with Spanish-language lyrics for both &quot;Techno Pop&quot; and &quot;Sex Object&quot; (often mistakenly titled &quot;Objeto Sexual&quot; by discographers). The Spanish-only vinyl album was withdrawn soon afterward because of a manufacturing error—a several-second complete drop-out of sound during the final track—and has never been reissued on CD. Both versions were also available as a cassette.
* The song &quot;Sex Object&quot; is absent from the South Korean pressings of the album.

==Re-issues==
A remastered edition of &quot;Electric Café&quot; was released by EMI Records, Mute Records and Astralwerks Records on CD, digital download and heavyweight vinyl in October–November 2009. The release was changed back to the original title of &quot;Techno Pop&quot;. Because of licensing restrictions imposed by Warner Music Group before 2013, this version has only been made available in the US and Canada as a part of &quot;The Catalogue&quot; boxed set. However, since 2013, with the sale and break-up of EMI, the album’s rights are controlled by Warner worldwide.

<text>Haymarket is an inner city suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is located at the southern end of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Haymarket includes much of Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown, Thaitown and Railway Square localities. Haymarket is adjacent to Darling Harbour and is surrounded by the suburbs of Ultimo, Chippendale, Surry Hills and the Sydney CBD.

==History==

Sydney&#x27;s produce markets were located in Haymarket from the early 20th century through to the 1980s when they were moved to a new site at Flemington. Paddy&#x27;s Markets still operate on part of the site of the vegetable markets as a produce and flea market. The &#x27;Market City&#x27; complex contains the markets, The Peak apartment building, a modern shopping centre featuring a food court, restaurants, boutiques, specialty shops and entertainment options, such as a cinema and amusement centre.

The outer walls of the original vegetable market, built in 1909, were preserved and restored as an example of Edwardian architecture. They were part of the original city markets—designed by city architect C.Broderick—which were bounded by Hay Street, Quay Street and Thomas Street. They were built to replace the old Belmore Market, which had failed because it was too far from Darling Harbour.

The new markets included the Sydney City Markets building (Ultimo Road), designed by George McRae and built in 1910, and the Sydney Markets Bell Tower (Quay Street), built in 1911 and restored by the State Bank in 1985. The bell tower is now incorporated within the University of Technology Sydney.
By the 1920s, Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; had moved to Haymarket from the Rocks and Market Street near Darling Harbour. Haymarket became a commercial and community centre for the Chinese community who lived in large numbers in this area and nearby areas such as Surry Hills. With the relocation of the produce market to Flemington and outflow of residents to the suburbs, the commercial role of Haymarket declined. The City of Sydney authorities embarked on a project to establish Haymarket as a tourist-oriented Chinatown. In the 1980s, Dixon Street was pedestrianised, and nearby redevelopments were steered towards creating the atmosphere of an &quot;authentic&quot; Chinatown. This included the construction of Chinese paifang-style gates, with stone lions, on Dixon Street, and other Chinese-style street furniture, as well as encouraging Chinese restaurants to open along Dixon Street. Despite significant demographic change due to successive waves of immigration from Asia, today&#x27;s Chinatown remains a centre for Asian restaurants and other businesses.

The Capitol Theatre, built in 1928, is also located in Haymarket.

== Heritage listings ==
Haymarket has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 17 Little Pier Street: Hydraulic Pump Station

<text>Breakneck Ridge station is a rail station on the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line, serving campers and hikers traveling to and from Breakneck Ridge, in Fishkill, New York. Trains stop at the station on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays only.

==Station layout==
The station has two small, wooden low-level side platforms each long enough for one door of one car to receive or discharge passengers. It is located off an embankment from New York State Route 9D, with only one sign (on the east side of the track), merely a small path leading to the overpass and then down to the tracks about a half-mile (800 m) north of the main parking area for the Breakneck Ridge hiking trail.

==History==
In June 2017, the Town of Fishkill requested a portion of Metro-North&#x27;s property to build and operate a multi-use trail from New York State Route 9D to the Hudson Line. It would run from the Breakneck Ridge Trailhead before running north to the pedestrian overpass that provides access to the inbound side of Metro-North&#x27;s Breakneck Ridge station. To be known as the &quot;Breakneck Connector,&quot; it is the first portion of the proposed Hudson Highland Fjord Trail to be constructed. Over the past few years, more people have been using the Breakneck Ridge station, resulting in an increase in weekend service at the station.

The station has low-level platforms which are connected to Route 9D by dirt paths, posing a safety risk. The Trail will directly connect the station and the trail head without meeting Route 9D at-grade. The low-level platforms at the station will be replaced with small high-level platforms with ADA accessible ramps. A newly designed parking lot will be constructed while maintaining an existing Metro-North access point for maintenance vehicles. The platforms and other appurtenances will be paid for by the Town for $200,000. The land will be leased for 257 years to the Town of Fishkill. The stop and trailhead was initially planned to close for reconstruction at the beginning of 2018, with reopening planned for April 2019. However, by May 2019, the station&#x27;s closure and reconstruction, along with that of the rest of the Breakneck Ridge trailhead, was slated for mid-2020 at the earliest.

The station closed in 2020 when the state closed Breakneck Ridge and other trails due to the number of hikers walking along Route 9D. The first round of construction began in October 2021. The station reopened on May 28, 2022, with most of the track access outside the platforms fenced off, anti-trespass panels on the tracks near the platforms, more visible warning and wayfinding signage, and a path from Route 9D to the overpass along the fencing.

In June 2022, the MTA credited the reopening of the station with Metro-North carrying 90 percent of pre-pandemic ridership on the two following weekends. However, the station was expected to close again from late 2022 to 2025 during construction of the full Breakneck Connector project.

<doc id="556722" wikidata="Q434649" url="?curid=556722" title="Jenny Macklin">
<text>Jennifer Louise Macklin (born 29 December 1953) is an Australian former politician. She was elected to federal parliament at the 1996 federal election and served as the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 2001 to 2006, under opposition leaders Simon Crean, Mark Latham and Kim Beazley. After the ALP won government at the 2007 election, she held ministerial office under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, serving as Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (2007–2013) and Minister for Disability Reform (2011–2013). She retired from parliament at the 2019 election.

==Early life==
Macklin was born in Brisbane on 29 December 1953. Her father was an engineer. She grew up in country Victoria, initially in Cohuna where she attended the local primary school. In 1966 the family moved to Wangaratta where she attended Wangaratta High School, also spending a year as an exchange student in Japan on a Rotary Scholarship. Macklin went on to the University of Melbourne, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Commerce (Hons.).

From 1976 to 1978, Macklin worked as a researcher at the Australian National University (ANU) under accounting and finance professor Russell Matthews. She then joined the Parliamentary Library as an economics specialist within the Legislative Research Service. She was a member of a Canberra discussion group, the Red Fems, which presented a paper to the Women and Labour Conference in 1980. Her work on energy pricing in the aluminium industry came to the attention of Victorian Labor MP Brian Howe, and in 1981 he recruited her to join the Labor Resource Centre in Melbourne as a research coordinator. From 1985 to 1988, Macklin served as an adviser to David White, the state health minister.

In 1990, Macklin&#x27;s mentor Brian Howe was appointed Minister for Health in the Hawke government. She was subsequently appointed as the director of the government&#x27;s National Health Strategy (NHS) initiative, tasked with reviewing Australia&#x27;s existing health system. She delivered a series of background papers and issues papers, one of which proposed the abolition of private health insurance. The NHS body was disbanded in 1993 following a one-year extension of its initial two-year term. Macklin then served as director of the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review from 1993 to 1995.

==Political career==

In 1994, Macklin won ALP preselection for the Division of Jagajaga, defeating former Casey MP Peter Steedman.

===Opposition (1996–2007)===

Macklin was elected to parliament at the 1996 federal election, which saw the defeat of the ALP government. She was immediately elected a member of the shadow ministry, where she served in a number of roles, including Shadow Minister for Aged Care, Social Security and the Status of Women. After the 1998 election, Macklin became Shadow Minister for Health. She is a member of the Socialist Left faction of the Labor Party.

After the ALP&#x27;s defeat at the 2001 election, Macklin was elected unopposed as deputy leader to Simon Crean. She was the first woman to hold a leadership position in either Australian major party. She took on the position of Shadow Minister for Education. Macklin remained Deputy Leader after Crean&#x27;s replacement as leader by Mark Latham in December 2003, and also under Kim Beazley following Latham&#x27;s resignation in January 2005. Macklin became the first person to be deputy to three leaders of the ALP since Frank Forde.

On 1 December 2006, Macklin&#x27;s position as deputy leader of the ALP came under threat after Kim Beazley called for a spill of all the leadership positions, in a bid to end growing speculation over the issue. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Kevin Rudd, and Shadow Minister for Health, Julia Gillard, announced their intentions to run against Beazley and Macklin as a team for the positions of leader and deputy leader respectively of the party. On the day of the ballot, Macklin effectively stepped down from the position, choosing not to contest the deputy leadership after Kevin Rudd was elected as the new party leader. Macklin was once again elected to the Shadow frontbench, and was appointed Shadow Minister for Families and Community Services and Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Reconciliation. She maintained these portfolios in government after Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2007 election.

===Government (2007–2013)===
In 2007, Macklin became the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. In this capacity she oversaw the passage and implementation of Australia&#x27;s first national Paid Parental Leave Scheme, the Closing the Gap framework to address the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, a historic rise in the pensions and a number of other significant changes to social policy and family support payments.

In 2011, Macklin was given the additional responsibility of Minister for Disability Reform, overseeing the design and implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Macklin was also a member of the Government&#x27;s Expenditure Review Committee and Chair of the Government&#x27;s Social Policy Committee.

====Indigenous Affairs====
Macklin was Minister for Indigenous Affairs throughout the Labor government&#x27;s two terms in office. Macklin was instrumental in the Apology to Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples, delivered by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in February 2008 and the implementation of the Close the Gap Framework, the first comprehensive strategy for tackling Indigenous disadvantage in Australia&#x27;s history. This strategy saw record investment in health, education, housing, early childhood development and remote Indigenous service provision.

She has said that one of her most important achievements was to take the politics out of Indigenous affairs and destroy the toxic division between &quot;symbols&quot; and &quot;practical&quot; change. On 23 November 2011, the Stronger Futures Policy legislation was introduced by Macklin to address key issues such as unemployment, school attendance, alcohol abuse, child protection, safety, housing and land reforms in the Northern Territory.

====National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)====
On 10 August 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister Macklin announced the Labor government&#x27;s support for a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) a major social policy reform designed to ensure that people with disability received the care and support they need.

The rollout of the NDIS commenced in 2013 at four launch sites around Australia, with full rollout to be completed in 2019. Macklin was instrumental in the success of negotiations with states and territories, which resulted in a nationwide agreement on the NDIS. When fully completed in 2019 the NDIS is expected to cover around 460,000 Australians with disability.

====Paid parental leave====
Macklin was the Minister was responsible for the design and implementation of Australia&#x27;s first national paid parental leave scheme. Prior to its launch on 1 January 2011, Australia was one of two developed countries without a national paid parental leave scheme. The scheme provides primary care givers with 18 weeks paid parental leave paid at the national minimum wage. In the six years since the scheme was launched more than 700,000 Australian families have accessed paid parental leave.

An independent review of the scheme in 2014 found that more than 75 per cent of parents accessing paid parental leave were on incomes of less than $70,000 a year. In the 2015 Budget the Abbott government announced a measure to end so called &quot;double dipping&quot; of paid parental leave by restricting 80,000 new parents from accessing both employer and government paid parental leave schemes. The use of the term provoked widespread condemnation from women&#x27;s groups and some employers. Macklin led Labor&#x27;s opposition to the Liberal government&#x27;s cuts to paid parental leave, which have failed to pass the Parliament.

====Dad and Partner Pay====
The introduction of Dad and Partner Pay (DAPP) on 1 January 2013, established two weeks paid leave to fathers and partners to help them take time off work to support new mothers in their caring role and be involved in the care of their newborn baby. This was another social policy reform that Macklin spearheaded during her time as Minister. An independent report conducted by the University of Queensland in 2014 found that DAPP reduced the barriers to fathers taking leave following a birth.

====Apology to Forgotten Australians====
Macklin was also the steward for the national apology to the Forgotten Australians and former child migrants, in her capacity as Families Minister. Prime Minister Rudd gave the apology on 16 November 2009 on behalf of the Australian Government to over half a million children who were taken from their families and placed in institutions where they were often victims of abuse. Macklin said the apology demonstrated &quot;the shared resolve to make sure the abuse and neglect never happens again&quot;.

===Opposition (2013–2019)===

Following the ALP&#x27;s defeat at the 2013 federal election, Macklin endorsed Anthony Albanese for the leadership of the party. Albanese was defeated by Bill Shorten in the leadership vote. Macklin was included in Shorten&#x27;s shadow ministry and retained her place until announcing her retirement, holding the portfolios of families and payments (2013–2016), disability reform (2013–2016) and families and social services (2016–2018).

Macklin announced her retirement from politics on 6 July 2018, effective at the 2019 federal election.

==Later activities==
In June 2020, Macklin and former Victorian Labor Premier Steve Bracks were appointed as administrators of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party by the party&#x27;s National Executive until early 2021, after allegations of branch-stacking by Victorian minister Adem Somyurek were revealed. The pair will review the state party&#x27;s operations and provide detailed recommendations to tackle the issue of branch-stacking within the party.

In 2022, Macklin was appointed as chair of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, a panel which publishes yearly recommendations to government on the adequacy of welfare payments. Macklin was also appointed to the Australian University Accords panel in 2022 by education minister Jason Clare. The panel published a final report in 2024 recommending reforms to Australia&#x27;s higher education system.

==Honours==
Macklin was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;eminent service to the people and Parliament of Australia, to social welfare, particularly the introduction of paid parental leave and the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and to the Indigenous community&quot;.

<text>Goran Jelisić (; born 7 June 1968) is a Bosnian Serb war criminal who was found guilty of having committed crimes against humanity and violating the customs of war by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at the Luka camp in Brčko during the Bosnian War. Jelisić called himself the &quot;Serb Adolf Hitler&quot; and admitted that his &quot;motivation and goal was to kill Muslims&quot;.

==Biography==
Jelisić was born in 1968 in Bijeljina, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia. a town that was at the time 40% Bosniaks. Born to a working mother, he was raised primarily by his grandmother, and he had a variety of Serb and Bosniak friends. Prior to the war, Jelisić worked as a farmhand and enjoyed fishing. During his trial, members of his fishing groups defended him as character witnesses. After committing cheque fraud in Bosnia, he was imprisoned for several months.

===Bosnian War===
He was released in February 1992 with the opportunity to volunteer for Republika Srpska&#x27;s war effort. In May, Goran Jelisić arrived in Brčko.

During the war, Jelisić commanded the Luka camp, which was one of the most notorious prison camps during the Bosnian War. It was located on the most important arterial road near Brčko in north Bosnia, which connected the two parts of Republika Srpska. Jelisić later confessed his crimes during his trial as a war criminal at the Hague tribunal. His wife, Monika Karan-Ilić (aka Monika Simeunović), was also found guilty of participating in torture, inhumane treatment and infliction of suffering on Bosniak and Croat civilians at Luka camp and Brčko police station in May and June 1992.

During Jelisić&#x27;s trial, many witnesses came forward, describing other acts by him during the war. An old Bosniak friend of Jelisić&#x27;s noted that Jelisić gave his wife money while he was in captivity to help her flee abroad. Another friend of Jelisić&#x27;s described how he helped the friend&#x27;s sister and her husband escape in a similar way. Others submitted similar testimony regarding Jelisić&#x27;s acts to safeguard and help Bosniaks and non-Bosniaks friends before and during the war. In his hometown of Bijeljina, Jelisić paid hospital costs for Bosniaks.

He styled himself, and has been referred to in the media, as &quot;Serb Adolf&quot;.

===Trial===
On 22 January 1998, Jelisić was apprehended in Serb-dominated Bijeljina by Task Force Razorback—a joint CIA–DOD unit attached to Operation Amber Star. This was the culmination of a months-long intelligence operation (codenamed Operation Amber Light) led by Lt Col Rick Francona. The Navy SEAL team which executed the arrest was led by Ryan Zinke, who would later be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Jelisić&#x27;s apartment was surrounded by U.S. forces, and he was taken without incident. This capture was the first performed by U.S. forces against a Bosnian war criminal (though U.S. forces had served as backup for Dutch and British forces in the previous year). After his capture, Jelisić was transferred to a U.S. base at Tuzla, taken into custody by an FBI Special Agent and flown to The Hague. 

U.S. forces reported that the operation was planned in advance. The operation occurred during a week in which human rights groups were pressuring the Clinton administration to use U.S. troops to help detain some of the dozens of war criminals still at large.

Jelisić faced trial for one count of genocide, sixteen counts of violating the customs of war and fifteen counts of crimes against humanity in relation to his involvement in the inhumane treatment and systematic killing of detainees at the Luka camp, where he was alleged to have, every day, &quot;entered Luka&#x27;s main hangar, where most detainees were kept, selected detainees for interrogation, beat them and then often shot and killed them&quot;. A specific instance of this type of allegation is that Jelisić beat an elderly Bosniak man to death with a metal pipe, a shovel, and a wooden stick.

In 1999, Jelisić pleaded guilty to the charges of crimes against humanity and violating the customs of war. He was acquitted on the charge of genocide as the court did not believe the prosecution had proved this beyond reasonable doubt. He was sentenced to 40 years&#x27; imprisonment. The same sentence was confirmed by the appeals chamber. The sentence was at that time the most severe given by the Hague, superseding the 20-year ruling against Duško Tadić. The court also suggested Jelisić receive psychiatric treatment. In 2001, the prosecution requested a retrial on Jelisić&#x27;s dismissed charge of genocide, but an appeals court upheld his 40-year sentence. On 29 May 2003, Jelisić was transferred to Italy to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for time served since his 1998 arrest.

Jelisić&#x27;s trial is considered important for setting a high standard of evidence for charges of genocide. His was also significant for being one of only three people to admit to their crimes before the Hague tribunal (as of 2004).

Jelisić later attended the war crimes trial of Esad Landžo, a Bosniak who committed war crimes against Serbs at the Čelebići camp. He provided a passionate character witness in defense of the Bosniak, noting how Landžo had aided other prisoners in the prison at The Hague.

===Personal life===

On 21 December 2011, his wife, Monika Karan-Ilić (aka Monika Simeunović), was detained on suspicion of having committed war crimes against non-Serbs at the Luka camp. A native of Brčko, she was found guilty of having participated in torture, inhumane treatment and infliction of suffering on Bosniak and Croat civilians in the Luka camp and Brčko police station between May and June 1992, when she was a teenager. Her sentence was reduced to two-and-a-half years of prison in 2013.

==Memorial Plaque in the Zanatski Center==
From 2023, the non-governmental agency UDIK demands from the Brčko District authorities to place a memorial plaque in the Zanatski Center in Brčko. The photographs of the execution of two Bosniaks, Hajrudin Muzurović and Husein Kršo in that location on May 7, 1992, testified to the war crimes and ethnic cleansing of Brčko.

On May 7, 2024, UDIK with the members of Muzurović and Kršo families laid flowers at the place of the murder. It was the first commemoration held in street of Zanatski Center in Brčko which Goran Jelisić used as an execution ground.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Public Service is one of the fourteen American Pulitzer Prizes annually awarded for journalism. It recognizes a distinguished example of meritorious public service by a newspaper or news site through the use of its journalistic resources, which may include editorials, cartoons, photographs, graphics, video and other online material, and may be presented in print or online or both. 

The Public Service prize was one of the original Pulitzers, established in 1917, but no award was given that year. It is the only prize in the program that awards a gold medal and is the most prestigious one for a newspaper to win.

As with other Pulitzer Prizes, a committee of jurors narrows the field to three nominees, from which the Pulitzer Board generally picks a winner and finalists. Finalists have been made public since 1980. The Pulitzer Board issues an official citation explaining the reason for the award.

==Winners and citations==
In its first 97 years to 2013, the Public Service Pulitzer was awarded 96 times. There were four years for which no award was given, and two prizes were awarded in the years 1967, 1990, and 2006. In 1950, 1951, 1953, 1955 and 1959, prizes were awarded to two newspapers.
