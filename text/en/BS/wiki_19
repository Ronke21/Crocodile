<doc id="538922" wikidata="Q62939" url="?curid=538922" title="Burj Al Arab">
<text>The Burj Al Arab (, ) is a luxury hotel in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Developed and managed by Jumeirah, it is one of the tallest hotels in the world, although 39% of its total height is made up of non-occupiable space. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island that is from Jumeirah Beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to resemble the sail of a dhow. It has a helipad near the roof, at a height of above ground.

== Site ==
The beachfront area where Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach Hotel are located was previously called Chicago Beach. The hotel is located on an island of reclaimed land, offshore of the beach of the former &quot;Chicago Beach Hotel&quot;. The former hotel was demolished during the construction of the Burj Al Arab. The locale&#x27;s name had its origins in the Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, which at one time welded giant floating oil storage tanks, known locally as &quot;Kazzans&quot;, on the site.

==History==
=== Design and construction ===
The Burj Al Arab was designed by the British multidisciplinary consultancy Atkins, led by architect Tom Wright of WKA. He came up with the iconic design and signature translucent fiberglass facade that serves as a shield from the desert sun during the day and as a screen for illumination at night. The design was managed by Canadian engineer Rick Gregory, and construction managed by David Kirby also of WS Atkins. The Burj Al Arab&#x27;s interior is by British-Chinese designer Khuan Chew. Construction of the island began in 1994 and involved up to 2,000 construction workers during peak construction. Two &quot;wings&quot; spread in a V to form a vast &quot;mast&quot;, while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium. The setting of a high rise building on saturated soil and the novelty of the project required groundbreaking dynamic analysis and design to take into consideration soil-structure interaction, effect of water, high winds, and helipad among other loads, to help finalize the design and take the project into construction.

The hotel was built by South African construction contractor Murray &amp; Roberts, now renamed Concor and Al Habtoor Engineering. The interior designs were led and created by Khuan Chew and John Coralan of KCA international and delivered by UAE based Depa Group.

The building opened on 1 December 1999.

The hotel&#x27;s helipad was designed by Irish architect Rebecca Gernon. The helipad is at the building&#x27;s 28th floor, and the helipad been used as a car race track, a boxing ring, has hosted a tennis match, and the jumping off point for the highest kite surfing jump in history.

== Features ==

Several features of the hotel required complex engineering feats to achieve. The hotel rests on an artificial island constructed offshore. To secure a foundation, the builders drove 230 concrete piles into the sand by drilling method.

Engineers created a ground surface layer of large rocks, which is circled with a concrete honeycomb pattern, which serves to protect the foundation from erosion. It took three years to reclaim the land from the sea, while it took fewer than three years to construct the building itself. The building contains over of concrete and 9,000 tons of steel, one of which are for the skeletal structural frames.

Inside the building, the atrium is tall.

Given the height of the building, the Burj Al Arab is the world&#x27;s fifth tallest hotel after Gevora Hotel, JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, Four Seasons Place Kuala Lumpur and Rose and Rayhaan by Rotana. But if buildings with mixed use were stripped off the list, the Burj Al Arab would be the world&#x27;s third tallest hotel. The structure of the Rose Rayhaan, also in Dubai, is tall, taller than the Burj Al Arab, which is tall.The Burj Al Arab’s helipad, located 210 meters above ground, has been the site of several high-profile events, including a tennis match between Roger Federer and Andre Agassi, and stunts by Red Bull athletes.

===Rooms and suites===
The hotel is managed by the Jumeirah Group. The hotel has 199 exclusive suites each allocated eight dedicated staff members and a 24-hour butler service. The smallest suite occupies an area of , the largest covers .

The Royal Suite, billed at per night, is listed at number 12 on &quot;World&#x27;s 15 most expensive hotel suites&quot; compiled by CNN Go in 2012.

The Burj Al Arab is very popular with the Chinese market, which made up 25 percent of all bookings at the hotel in 2011 and 2012.

===Restaurants===
There are six restaurants in the hotel, including:

&quot;Al Muntaha&quot; (&quot;The Ultimate&quot;), is located above the Persian Gulf, offering a view of Dubai. It is supported by a full cantilever that extends from either side of the mast, and is accessed by a panoramic elevator.

&quot;Al Mahara&quot; (&quot;Oyster&quot;), which is accessed via a simulated submarine voyage, features a large seawater aquarium, holding roughly of water. The wall of the tank, made of acrylic glass in order to withstand the water pressure, is about thick.

===Rating===
While the hotel has sometimes been described as &quot;the world&#x27;s only &#x27;seven-star&#x27; hotel&quot;, the hotel management claims never to have done so themselves. The term appeared due to a British journalist who had visited the hotel on a tour before it was officially opened. The journalist described Burj al Arab as &quot;more than anything she has ever seen&quot; and therefore referred to it as a seven-star hotel. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson said &quot;There&#x27;s not a lot we can do to stop it. We&#x27;re not encouraging the use of the term. We&#x27;ve never used it in our advertising.&quot;

==Reception==

===Reviews by architecture critics===

Burj Al Arab has attracted criticism as well &quot;a contradiction of sorts, considering how well-designed and impressive the construction ultimately proves to be.&quot; The contradiction here seems to be related to the hotel&#x27;s decor. &quot;This extraordinary investment in state-of-the-art construction technology stretches the limits of the ambitious urban imagination in an exercise that is largely due to the power of excessive wealth.&quot; Another critic includes negative critiques for the city of Dubai as well: &quot;both the hotel and the city, after all, are monuments to the triumph of money over practicality. Both elevate style over substance.&quot; Yet another: &quot;Emulating the quality of palatial interiors, in an expression of wealth for the mainstream, a theater of opulence is created in Burj Al Arab ... The result is a baroque effect&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The last chapter of the espionage novel &quot;Performance Anomalies&quot; takes place at the top of the Burj Al Arab, where the spy protagonist Cono 7Q discovers that through deadly betrayal his spy nemesis Katerina has maneuvered herself into the top echelon of the government of Kazakhstan. The hotel can also be seen in &quot;Syriana&quot; and also some Bollywood movies.

Richard Hammond included the building in his television series, &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Engineering Connections&quot;.

The Burj Al Arab serves as the cover image for the 2009 album &quot;Ocean Eyes&quot; by Owl City.

The Burj Al Arab was the site of the last task of the fifth episode of the first season of the Chinese edition of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, where teams had to clean up a room to the hotel&#x27;s standards.

The building is featured in Matthew Reilly&#x27;s novel &quot;The Six Sacred Stones&quot;, where a kamikaze pilot crashes a plane into the hotel, destroying it in an attempt to kill the protagonist, Jack West Jr.

The building was the location of the main challenge of the ninth episode of the Canadian-American animated television series &quot;Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race&quot;, where contestants were tasked to either return a serve from a tennis robot on the hotel&#x27;s helipad, or squeegee an entire column of the hotel&#x27;s windows.

<doc id="538924" wikidata="Q1326284" url="?curid=538924" title="Saint Ann Parish">
<text>Saint Ann () is the largest parish in Jamaica. It is situated on the north coast of the island, in the county of Middlesex, roughly halfway between the eastern and western ends of the island. It is often called &quot;the Garden Parish of Jamaica&quot; on account of its natural floral beauty. Its capital is Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay. Saint Ann comprises New Seville, the first Spanish settlement in Jamaica.

Saint Ann is the birthplace of reggae singers Floyd Lloyd, Burning Spear, Busy Signal, Bryan Art, Romain Virgo, Rashawn Dally, Chezidek, Shabba Ranks, Justin Hinds, Perfect, and Bob Marley. Marcus Mosiah Garvey, one of the seven recipients of Jamaica&#x27;s Order of National Hero, was also born there.

==History==
Saint Ann is one of the oldest populated areas in the island of Jamaica tracing back to 600–650 A.D. It is believed to be the earliest Taino/Arawak settlement in Jamaica. When Christopher Columbus first came to Jamaica in 1494, he landed on the shores of Saint Ann at Discovery Bay, Jamaica. He returned to Jamaica on his fourth voyage and was eventually marooned for one year at Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay (June 1503 – June 1504), which he called Santa Gloria. The first Spanish settlement in Jamaica was also at Sevilla la Nueva, now called Seville, just to the west of Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay. Established by Juan de Esquivel, the first Spanish Governor of Jamaica, Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay became the third capital established by Spain in the Americas. The first sugar mills were established by the Spaniards in Sevilla la Nueva before 1526.
After 1655, when the English captured Jamaica, Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay gradually developed as a fishing port with many warehouses and wharves. The parish of Saint Ann was later named after Lady Anne Hyde the first wife of King James II of England. Ocho Rios began to develop as a modern town and a favourite tourist destination in Jamaica. Its development commenced when Reynolds Jamaica Mines built a deep-water pier, west of the town to ship bauxite ore from the mines.

In the 1960s the Saint Ann Development Council began the systematic development of Ocho Rios, creating a modern town.

==Geography==

The parish is located at latitude 18°12&#x27;N, longitude 77°28&#x27;W. It is bordered by Clarendon and Saint Catherine in the south, Saint Mary in the east, and Trelawny in the west. As with all but one parish, its coast is washed by the Caribbean Sea. Saint Ann covers an area of 1,212.6 km2, making it the largest parish, before Saint Elizabeth&#x27;s 1,212.4 km2. The population was an estimated at 173,232 in 2012. Besides Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay, other important towns located in Saint Ann are Discovery Bay, Brown&#x27;s Town, and Ocho Rios.

The highest elevation in the parish is in the Dry Harbour Mountains at 762 metres above sea level. Because of its limestone formation, the parish is noted for its 59 caves and numerous sinkholes. The Moneague Lake, which varies considerably in size, is one of the few large intermittent lakes in the island. The boundary between Saint Ann and Saint Mary is formed by the White River, which flows for 27.4 kilometres. Other rivers like the Dunn&#x27;s River appear intermittently, rising a few kilometres from the coast. The names of the main rivers are Negro, Saint Ann, Great, Roaring, Cave and Pedro (see List of rivers of Jamaica).

===Agriculture===
The agricultural products are mainly bananas, allspice/pimento, sugar, coconuts, coffee, limes, corn, ginger, sweet potatoes, sensimilia yam, and annatto. The soil is also suitable for citrus and, sisal is cultivated in the drier areas. The parish is also noted for cattle rearing, horses and hogs (swine). Recently, however, agriculture has been on the decline as farmland is being used for housing and other developments and the cultivated area has decreased.

===Tourism===
The major economic activity in the parish is tourism. Saint Ann is one of the major tourist destinations of Jamaica, given that Dunn&#x27;s River Falls and many popular beaches, like Puerto Seco Beach, are located there. There is a cruise ship dock (maritime) on the west shore of Ocho Rios Bay, and numerous hotels and resorts (including a Sandals Resort) are located in and around the city. It is also the birthplace/resting place for Bob Marley (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981).

===Commerce===

Banks and supermarkets along with some restaurants make up the rest of the economy. The farmers market where small farmers and food vendors operate is also a source of employment for the locals.

===Historic===

St. Ann&#x27;s is a historically significant location that has undergone major development over the years. It was the site of Spanish settlement and civilization in Jamaica, and despite the capital being moved, it remains one of the most important parishes on the island. St. Ann is known for having the most free villages in Jamaica, including Clarksonville which was established in 1835. Originally a small market town and fishing village, St. Ann has evolved into a major player in Jamaica&#x27;s Bauxite Industry. The parish is also known for its natural beauty and was named Santa Ana (St. Ann) by the Spaniards, earning the nickname &quot;Garden Parish&quot; of Jamaica. 

The Parish has rich history, including being the location where Christopher Columbus first set foot in Jamaica on May 4, 1494 during his second voyage in the Americas. The British Man-O-War, the Hinchinbrook, previously commanded by then Post-Captain Horatio Nelson, also has ties to St. Ann&#x27;s Parish. The ship was taking on water under the command of Lieutenant John Markham in 1782 soon after leaving Port Royal and sought shelter in St. Ann&#x27;s Bay, but could not be coaxed over the reef and sank after a nearby schooner took some stores and a few cannons. The anchor of the Hinchinbrook was later retrieved and placed as a landmark in Priory. While many tour buses pass by the landmark on their way to Ocho Rios or Port Antonio, few may realize the significance of the old anchor and its ties to Jamaican history.

<text>α-Aminobutyric acid (AABA), also known as homoalanine in biochemistry, is a non-proteinogenic alpha amino acid with chemical formula C4H9NO2. The straight two carbon side chain is one carbon longer than alanine, hence the prefix homo-. The conjugate base of α-aminobutyric acid is the carboxylate α-aminobutyrate.

Homoalanine is biosynthesized by transaminating oxobutyrate, a metabolite in isoleucine biosynthesis. It is used by nonribosomal peptide synthases. One example of a nonribosomal peptide containing homoalanine is ophthalmic acid, which was first isolated from calf lens.

α-Aminobutyric acid is one of the three isomers of aminobutyric acid. The two other are the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) which is known for inducing plant disease resistance.

This amino acid has been detected in meteorites.

<doc id="538941" wikidata="Q382352" url="?curid=538941" title="Charles Francis Adams III">
<text>Charles Francis Adams III (August 2, 1866 – June 10, 1954) was an American lawyer and politician, who served as the 44th United States Secretary of the Navy under President Herbert Hoover from 1929 to 1933. He was the captain of the &quot;Resolute&quot; which won the 1920 America&#x27;s Cup.

Adams graduated from Harvard College in 1888 and then Harvard Law School in 1892. After going from being a lawyer and then a businessman, he was elected mayor of Quincy in 1896 and unelected a year later. Adams married Frances Lovering in 1899 and they had 2 children. He proposed to the Congress in 1903 that the USS Constitution be restored. He was granted this wish in 1907 when they raised funds to make her open to the public again. Adams was an officer in 43 corporations at one point, including the Harvard Corporation. He then was appointed Secretary of the Navy in 1929. He promoted public understanding of the Navy&#x27;s indispensable role in international affairs, and worked strenuously to maintain naval strength and efficiency during the Great Depression. In 1930, he successfully maintained the principle of United States&#x27; naval parity with Britain while serving at the London Naval Treaty. He retired from his position in 1933. It was noted by President Hoover he would have named Adams Secretary of State if he had known him at the start of his presidency.

==Early life==
Charles Francis Adams III was born on August 2, 1866, in Quincy, Massachusetts, to Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Cadwalader Crowninshield and John Quincy Adams II.

Adams graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1888, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Alpha chapter). He later graduated from Harvard Law School in 1892.

==Career==
After graduating from Harvard Law and being admitted to the bar in 1893, he was first a lawyer, then went into business. From 1896 to 1897, Adams served as mayor of Quincy, Massachusetts.

In 1903, while serving as president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Adams proposed to Congress that the famed frigate USS &quot;Constitution&quot; be restored and returned to active service. This led to Congress authorizing funds for the restoration of &quot;Constitution&quot; and opening her to the public in 1907.

In 1916, the Massachusetts legislature and electorate approved a calling of a constitutional convention. Adams was elected as a delegate at large to serve as a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917.

At one time, he was an officer in 43 corporations, including several banks and many of the country&#x27;s largest corporations such as the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, the Union Pacific Railroad, and the Harvard Corporation.

===Secretary of the Navy===

Adams was appointed Secretary of the Navy on March 5, 1929, by President Herbert Hoover. He vigorously promoted public understanding of the Navy&#x27;s indispensable role in international affairs, and worked strenuously to maintain naval strength and efficiency during the Great Depression. He served at the London Naval Treaty in 1930 where he successfully maintained the principle of United States naval parity with Britain. In his memoirs, Hoover noted that, had he known Adams at the start of his presidency as well as he did at its end, he would have named Adams his Secretary of State. Adams retired from his position on March 4, 1933.

Adams was a supporter of limited presidential terms, well before the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution passed, and advocated that the Presidents should be required to renounce political parties and that after they left the presidency, should be made ex-officio members of the United States Senate.

===Activities and interests===
In 1920, Adams skippered the America&#x27;s Cup defender &quot;Resolute&quot; and soon became known as the &quot;Dean of American Helmsmen&quot;. He was posthumously inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 1993. In 1939, he won the King&#x27;s Cup, Astor Cup, and Puritan Cup, the three most coveted domestic yachting trophies in a single season.

In 1929, he became a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. His national membership number was 48,952. He was also an honorary companion of the Naval Order of the United States. In 1932, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

A scion of the Adams family that produced two presidents, Charles Francis Adams III, a son of John Quincy Adams II, the oldest son of the Charles Francis Adams Sr., was a great-grandson of the sixth U. S. President John Quincy Adams, and a great-great-grandson of the second U.S. President John Adams. His mother Fanny Crowninshield was the granddaughter of U.S. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Williams Crowninshield. Adams was also the third cousin twice removed of Otis Norcross, the 19th Mayor of Boston. Both descending from their fourth great-grandfather, Joseph Adams; Otis from his first wife Mary [Chapin], and Charles from his second wife Hannah [Bass].

Charles Francis Adams Jr. was the uncle, not the father of Charles Francis Adams III, an assumption regularly made by virtue of sequential name succession. Charles F. Adams Jr. had five children, the first three being daughters, which may explain why his brother John Q. Adams II took the prerogative to name his firstborn son after his brother. Charles Jr.&#x27;s only sons (twins) were born in 1875.

=== Marriage and children ===
On April 3, 1899, Adams married Frances Lovering (d. 1956), the daughter of U.S. Representative William C. Lovering (1835–1910), at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. Together, they had two children:

* Catherine Frances Lovering Adams in 1902, who married Henry Sturgis Morgan, son of J. P. Morgan, Jr. and Jane Norton Grew and one of the founders of Morgan Stanley (1935), along with Harold Stanley, on June 26, 1923. Together, they had five sons.
* Charles Francis Adams IV in 1910, who was a prominent businessman and the first president of Raytheon Company, was married firstly to Margaret [Stockton]. Their children were: Abigail Adams, Allison Adams, Charles Francis Adams V, and Timothy Adams. He married secondly, widow Mrs. Beatrice D. Penati, who had a son named Giannotto Penati.

Adams died on June 11, 1954, and was interred in Mount Wollaston Cemetery in Quincy, Massachusetts, on June 13, 1954. His estate, valued at $192,000 in 1954, was left to his widow.

In 1899 Adams built his family home and estate on land in Concord, MA formerly owned by his uncle, Charles Francis Adams Jr. The home, known as Mt. Vernon, stood for 120 years until it was destroyed by fire shortly after Christmas Day 2019.

===Honors===
&quot;The Charles Francis Adams Memorial Trophy&quot; for yacht racing was established in his memory, and the Navy destroyer USS &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; was dedicated in his honor.

<doc id="538946" wikidata="Q238474" url="?curid=538946" title="Aminolevulinic acid">
<text>δ-Aminolevulinic acid (also dALA, δ-ALA, 5ALA or 5-aminolevulinic acid), an endogenous non-proteinogenic amino acid, is the first compound in the porphyrin synthesis pathway, the pathway that leads to heme in mammals, as well as chlorophyll in plants.

5ALA is used in photodynamic detection and surgery of cancer.

==Medical uses==
As a precursor of a photosensitizer, 5ALA is also used as an add-on agent for photodynamic therapy. In contrast to larger photosensitizer molecules, it is predicted by computer simulations to be able to penetrate tumor cell membranes.

===Cancer diagnosis===
Photodynamic detection is the use of photosensitive drugs with a light source of the right wavelength for the detection of cancer, using fluorescence of the drug. 5ALA, or derivatives thereof, can be used to visualize bladder cancer by fluorescence imaging.

===Cancer treatment===
Aminolevulinic acid is being studied for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a number of types of cancer. It is not currently a first line treatment for Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Its use in brain cancer is currently experimental. It has been studied in a number of gynecological cancers.

Aminolevulinic acid is indicated in adults for visualization of malignant tissue during surgery for malignant glioma (World Health Organization grade III and IV). It is used to visualise tumorous tissue in neurosurgical procedures. Studies since 2006 have shown that the intraoperative use of this guiding method may reduce the tumour residual volume and prolong progression-free survival in people with malignant gliomas. The US FDA approved aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA HCL) for this use in 2017.

=== Intra-operative Cancer Delineation ===
Aminolevulinic acid utilization is promising in the field of cancer delineation, particularly in the context of fluorescence-guided surgery. This compound is utilized to enhance the visualization of malignant tissues during surgical procedures. When administered to patients, 5-ALA is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) preferentially in cancer cells, leading to their fluorescence under specific light wavelengths. This fluorescence aids surgeons in real-time identification and precise removal of cancerous tissue, reducing the likelihood of leaving residual tumor cells behind. This innovative approach has shown success in various cancer types, including brain and spine gliomas, bladder cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma.

==Side effects==
Side effects may include liver damage and nerve problems. Hyperthermia may also occur. Deaths have also resulted.

==Biosynthesis==
In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, fungi, and protozoa, as well as the class Alphaproteobacteria of bacteria, it is produced by the enzyme ALA synthase, from glycine and succinyl-CoA. This reaction is known as the Shemin pathway, which occurs in mitochondria.

In plants, algae, bacteria (except for the class Alphaproteobacteria) and archaea, it is produced from glutamic acid via glutamyl-tRNA and glutamate-1-semialdehyde. The enzymes involved in this pathway are glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase. This pathway is known as the C5 or Beale pathway. In most plastid-containing species, glutamyl-tRNA is encoded by a plastid gene, and the transcription, as well as the following steps of C5 pathway, take place in plastids.

==Importance in humans==
===Activation of mitochondria===

In humans, 5ALA is a precursor to heme. Biosynthesized, 5ALA goes through a series of transformations in the cytosol and finally gets converted to Protoporphyrin IX inside the mitochondria. This protoporphyrin molecule chelates with iron in presence of enzyme ferrochelatase to produce Heme.

Heme increases the mitochondrial activity thereby helping in activation of respiratory system Krebs Cycle and Electron Transport Chain leading to formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for adequate supply of energy to the body.

===Accumulation of Protoporphyrin IX===
Cancer cells lack or have reduced ferrochelatase activity and this results in accumulation of Protoporphyrin IX, a fluorescent substance that can easily be visualized.

===Induction of Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1)===
Excess heme is converted in macrophages to Biliverdin and ferrous ions by the enzyme HO-1. Biliverdin formed further gets converted to Bilirubin and carbon monoxide. Biliverdin and Bilirubin are potent anti oxidants and regulate important biological processes like inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, fibrosis and angiogenesis.

==Plants==
In plants, production of 5-ALA is the step on which the speed of synthesis of chlorophyll is regulated. Plants that are fed by external 5-ALA accumulate toxic amounts of chlorophyll precursor, protochlorophyllide, indicating that the synthesis of this intermediate is not suppressed anywhere downwards in the chain of reaction. Protochlorophyllide is a strong photosensitizer in plants. Controlled spraying of 5-ALA at lower doses (up to 150 mg/L) can however help protect plants from stress and encourage growth.

<doc id="538948" wikidata="Q324299" url="?curid=538948" title="Aulos">
<text>An aulos (plural auloi; , plural ) or tibia (Latin) was a wind instrument in ancient Greece, often depicted in art and also attested by archaeology.

Though the word &quot;aulos&quot; is often translated as &quot;flute&quot; or as &quot;double flute&quot;, the instrument was usually double-reeded, and its sound—described as &quot;penetrating, insisting and exciting&quot;—was more akin to that of modern woodwind instruments such as oboes or bagpipes with a chanter and (modulated) drone.

An aulete (, ) was the musician who performed on an &quot;aulos&quot;. The ancient Roman equivalent was the tibicen (plural &quot;tibicines&quot;), from the Latin &quot;tibia,&quot; &quot;pipe, &quot;aulos&quot;.&quot; The neologism aulode is sometimes used by analogy with &quot;rhapsode&quot; and &quot;citharode&quot; (citharede) to refer to an &quot;aulos&quot;-player, who may also be called an aulist; however, &quot;aulode&quot; more commonly refers to a singer who sang the accompaniment to a piece played on the aulos.

==Background==

There were several kinds of &quot;aulos&quot;, single or double. The most common variety was a reed instrument. Archeological finds, surviving iconography and other evidence indicate that it was double-reeded, like the modern oboe, but with a larger mouthpiece, like the surviving Armenian duduk. A single pipe without a reed was called the &quot;monaulos&quot; (, from μόνος &quot;single&quot;). A single pipe held horizontally, as the modern flute, was the &quot;plagiaulos&quot; (πλαγίαυλος, from πλάγιος &quot;sideways&quot;). A pipe with a bag to allow for continuous sound (a bagpipe) was the &quot;askaulos&quot; (ἀσκαυλός from ἀσκός &quot;askos&quot; &quot;wineskin&quot;).

Like the Great Highland Bagpipe, the &quot;aulos&quot; has been used for martial music, but it is more frequently depicted in other social settings. A normal flute would produce insufficient volume to be of any use in military application, where a double-reed could be heard over larger distances, and over the clamour of marching whilst wearing armour. It was the standard accompaniment of the passionate elegiac poetry. It also accompanied physical activities such as wrestling matches, the broad jump, the discus throw and to mark the rowing cadence on triremes, as well as sacrifices and dramas. Plato associates it with the ecstatic cults of Dionysus and the Korybantes, banning it from his &quot;Republic&quot; but permitting it in his &quot;Laws&quot;.

Players of the aulos used a tool known as the &quot;Phorbeia&quot; or the &quot;Capistrum&quot;. It was a device that consisted of two straps. One was placed on top of the head and another was placed on the back of the head and stretched from ear to ear to support the cheeks. It was used by ancient musicians to play the aulos by allowing them to create noise through circular breathing and steady the instrument. It may have also been used to prevent the reeds of the instrument from falling down the throat of the player. Another potential use for the &quot;phrobeia&quot; was holding the lips in place, taking some strain off of the lip muscles.
Although aristocrats with sufficient leisure sometimes practiced aulos-playing as they did the lyre, after the later fifth century the aulos became chiefly associated with professional musicians, often slaves. Nevertheless, such musicians could achieve fame. The Romano-Greek writer Lucian discusses aulos playing in his dialogue &quot;Harmonides&quot;, in which Alexander the Great&#x27;s aulete Timotheus discusses fame with his pupil Harmonides. Timotheus advises him to impress the experts within his profession rather than seek popular approval in big public venues. If leading musicians admire him, popular approval will follow. However, Lucian reports that Harmonides died from excessive blowing during practicing.

==Mythic origin==
In myth, Marsyas the satyr was supposed to have invented the aulos, or else picked it up after Athena had thrown it away because it caused her cheeks to puff out and ruined her beauty. In any case, he challenged Apollo to a musical contest, where the winner would be able to &quot;do whatever he wanted&quot; to the loser—Marsyas&#x27;s expectation, typical of a satyr, was that this would be sexual in nature. But Apollo and his lyre beat Marsyas and his aulos. And since the pure lord of Delphi&#x27;s mind worked in different ways from Marsyas&#x27;s, he celebrated his victory by stringing his opponent up from a tree and flaying him alive.
Marsyas&#x27;s blood and the tears of the Muses formed the river Marsyas in Asia Minor.

This tale was a warning against committing the sin of &quot;hubris&quot;, or overweening pride, in that Marsyas thought he might win against a god. Strange and brutal as it is, this myth reflects a great many cultural tensions that the Greeks expressed in the opposition they often drew between the lyre and aulos: freedom vs. servility and tyranny, leisured amateurs vs. professionals, moderation (sophrosyne) vs. excess, etc. Some of this is a result of 19th century AD &quot;classical interpretation&quot;, i.e. Apollo versus Dionysus, or &quot;Reason&quot; (represented by the kithara) opposed to &quot;Madness&quot; (represented by the aulos). In the temple to Apollo at Delphi, there was also a shrine to Dionysus, and his Maenads are shown on drinking cups playing the aulos, but Dionysus is sometimes shown holding a kithara or lyre. So a modern interpretation can be a little more complicated than just simple duality.

This opposition is mostly an Athenian one. It might be surmised that things were different at Thebes, which was a center of aulos-playing. At Sparta—which had no Bacchic or Korybantic cults to serve as contrast—the aulos was actually associated with Apollo, and accompanied the hoplites into battle.
==Depiction in art==
=== Chigi vase ===
The battle scene on the Chigi vase shows an aulos player setting a lyrical rhythm for the hoplite phalanx to advance to. This accompaniment reduced the possibility of an opening in the formation of the blockage; the aulete had a fundamental role in ensuring the integrity of the phalanx. In this particular scene, the phalanx approaching from the left is unprepared and momentarily outnumbered four to five. More soldiers can be seen running up to assist them from behind. Even though the front four are lacking a fifth soldier, they have the advantage because the aulete is there to bring the formation back together.

=== Herakles in his tenth labor ===
An amphora from –530 BC depicts Herakles in the process of completing his tenth labor. Auletes can be seen playing in a procession going around on the neck of the amphora. 
==Modern use and popular culture==
The sounds of the aulos are being digitally recreated by the Ancient Instruments Sound/Timbre Reconstruction Application (ASTRA) project which uses physical modeling synthesis to simulate the aulos sounds. Due to the complexity of this process the ASTRA project uses grid computing to model sounds on hundreds of computers throughout Europe simultaneously.

The aulos is part of the Lost Sounds Orchestra, alongside other ancient instruments which ASTRA have recreated the sounds of, including the epigonion, the salpinx, the barbiton and the syrinx.

The aulos was also featured in the 2009 movie &quot;Agora&quot;, wherein a character performs a solo in an amphitheatre. It is also visible in the 2007 movie &quot;300&quot;.

Modern evolutions of the aulos exist in Southeastern Europe. In southern Albania, specifically, a double non-free aerophone resembling the aulos – called the cula diare or longari – is still played in the Labëria region to accompany Albanian iso-polyphony. These instruments are woodwind but not double-reeded like the aulos of antiquity.

<text>Charles Francis Adams Jr. (May 27, 1835 – March 20, 1915) was an American author, historian, and railroad and park commissioner who served as the president of the Union Pacific Railroad from 1884 to 1890. He served as a colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he was a railroad regulator and executive, an author of historical works, and a member of the Massachusetts Park Commission.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Boston, May 27, 1835, into a family with a long legacy in American public life. He was a great-grandson of United States President John Adams and a grandson of President John Quincy Adams. His father Charles Francis Adams Sr. was a lawyer, politician, diplomat, and writer. His siblings were older sister Louisa Catherine Adams, wife of Charles Kuhn, of Philadelphia; older brother John Quincy Adams II, father of Charles Francis Adams III; historian Henry Brooks Adams; Arthur Adams, who died in childhood; Mary Adams, who married Henry Parker Quincy, of Dedham, Massachusetts; and historian Peter Chardon Brooks Adams, of Beverly Farms, Massachusetts, who married Evelyn Davis.

Adams graduated from Harvard University in 1856 and then studied law in the office of Richard Henry Dana Jr. and was admitted to the bar in 1858. In 1895, he received an LL.D. degree from Harvard University.

==Civil War==
Adams served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry on December 28, 1861. He was promoted to captain on December 1, 1862. He fought with distinction during the Gettysburg Campaign, where his company was heavily engaged at the Battle of Aldie. When the regiment&#x27;s 3-year enlistment ended it was reduced to a battalion, and Adams was mustered out of service on September 1, 1864.

On September 8, 1864, he was commissioned as the lieutenant colonel of the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry (officially designated &quot;5th Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry&quot;). He was promoted to colonel and assumed command of the regiment on March 14, 1865, shortly before the end of the war. When he assumed command, the regiment was assigned guarding Confederate prisoners of war at Point Lookout, Maryland.

Adams, who wished to lead his regiment in combat, was able to get horses for his regiment and had it reassigned to front-line duty during the closing days of the campaign against Richmond. Adams wrote in his autobiography that he regretted having his unit reassigned since he came to the conclusion that the regiment&#x27;s black soldiers were ill-suited for combat duty. He led his regiment into Richmond shortly after it was captured in April 1865. Adams returned to Massachusetts in May due to illness (probably dysentery) and resigned from the Army on August 1, 1865.

On July 9, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Colonel Adams for the award of the rank of brevet (honorary) brigadier general, United States Volunteers, &quot;for distinguished gallantry and efficiency at the battles of Secessionville, South Carolina and South Mountain and Antietam, Maryland, and for meritorious services during the war&quot; to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U. S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866.

Adams was a Veteran Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS).

==Railroad reformer==

===Massachusetts Railroad Commission===
Following the Civil War, he was appointed to the Massachusetts Railroad Commission. There he attempted to persuade (rather than coerce) railroads into compliance with accepted business norms. Thomas McCraw called Adams&#x27;s approach to regulation &quot;the Sunshine Commission,&quot; because the purpose of the commission was to expose the corrupt business practices in the hope that, once out in the open, the businessmen would be shamed into mending their ways. It was in this vein that he wrote &quot;Chapters of Erie&quot;. However, true to his regulatory philosophy, he favored the protection of businessmen over that of the consumers. He saw regulation as necessary to protect investors and other businessmen from the capriciousness of a hostile public or the machinations of other unscrupulous stock jobbers.

===Union Pacific Railroad===
Congress distrusted the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and in 1884 forced it to hire Adams as the new president. Adams had long promoted various reform ideas, as in his book &quot;Railroads, Their Origin and Problems&quot; (1878), but he had little practical experience in management. As railroad president, he was successful in getting a good press for the UP, and he set up libraries along the route to allow his employees to better themselves. He had poor results dealing with the Knights of Labor. When the union refused extra work in Wyoming in 1885, Adams hired Chinese workers. The result was the Rock Springs massacre, which killed scores of Chinese and drove all the rest out of Wyoming. He tried to build a complex network of alliances with other businesses, but they provided little help to the UP. He had great difficulty in making decisions and in coordinating his subordinates. Adams was unable to stanch the worsening financial condition of the UP, and in 1890 the railroad&#x27;s owner Jay Gould forced him to resign.

==Historian==
Adams was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1871 and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1891.

After 1874, he devoted much of his time to the study of American history. In recognition of his work, Adams became vice-president of the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1890, he was chosen president of this society in 1895 and the American Historical Association in 1901. His writings and addresses on problems of railway management and other historical subjects frequently gave rise to widespread controversy.

In 1875, he published an essay on &quot;The Granger Movement&quot; in the North American Review. It exposed the railroad rate rigging and monopoly practices that prompted the movement.

Adams also wrote an autobiography, completed in 1912 and published posthumously in 1916. At the beginning of the autobiography is a memorial address about Adams written by Henry Cabot Lodge.

==Philanthropic activity==

===Massachusetts Park Commission===
From 1893 to 1895, he was chairman of the Massachusetts Park Commission, and as such took a prominent part in planning the present park system of the state. He was influential in establishing the Blue Hills Reservation and the Middlesex Fells Reservation.

===Single-tax supporter===
In 1900, he wrote an open letter to the President of the Massachusetts Single Tax League, declaring himself a supporter of the reform Henry George had proposed, which would later be known as Georgism. An excerpt of that letter appeared in &quot;The Outlook&quot;, December 15, 1900.

===National Civic Confederation===
Adams represented the public on the board of arbitration in the industrial department of the National Civic Confederation in New York city, December 17, 1901.
==Personal life==
On November 8, 1865, he married Mary Hone Ogden (1843–1934), daughter of Edward and Caroline Callender Ogden. The couple had three daughters and twin sons, both of whom graduated from Harvard in 1898. The five children were:
* Mary Ogden (&quot;Molly&quot;) Adams (b. 1867), who married Grafton St. Loe Abbott (1856–1915), a son of U.S. Representative Josiah Gardner Abbott. They were the parents of Mary Ogden Abbott.
* Louisa Catherine Adams (1872–1958), who married Thomas Nelson Perkins (1870–1937).
* Elizabeth Ogden (&quot;Elise&quot;) Adams (1873–1945).
* John Francis Adams (1875–1964), who married Marian Morse Adams (1878–1959). They were the parents of Thomas Boylston Adams.
* Henry Quincy Adams (1875–1951).

==Death and burial==
Adams died May 20, 1915. He is buried in Mount Wollaston Cemetery in Quincy, Massachusetts.

<text>The White Earth River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 50 mi (80 km) long, in northwestern North Dakota in the United States. It rises in the plains of southeastern Divide County, approximately 10 mi (16 km) east of Wildrose. It flows east and south, through Mountrail County and joins the Missouri in Lake Sakakawea.

The White Earth River was included as part of the western boundary of the Minnesota Territory (1849-1858). The law establishing the Minnesota Territory stated the boundary would follow the White Earth River to the Canadian Border. However, it was unknown at that time that the river&#x27;s source was not north of the international border.

<doc id="538958" wikidata="Q339499" url="?curid=538958" title="Factor XII">
<text>Coagulation factor XII, also known as Hageman factor, is a plasma protein involved in coagulation. It is the zymogen form of factor XIIa (), an enzyme of the serine protease (or serine endopeptidase) class. In humans, factor XII is encoded by &quot;F12&quot; gene.

== Genetics ==

The gene for factor XII is located on the tip of the long arm of the fifth chromosome (5q33-qter).

== Structure ==

Human Factor XII is 596 amino acids long and consists of two chains, the heavy chain (353 residues) and light chain (243 residues) held together by a disulfide bond. It is 80,000 daltons in molecular weight. The heavy chain contains two fibronectin-type domains (type I and II), two epidermal growth factor-like domains, a kringle domain, and a proline-rich region, while the light chain contains the protease domain. FXII can be cleaved sequentially at two sites, Arg353 and Arg334, with the second cleavage liberating the light chain and forming β-FXIIa. 

The structure of the FnI-EGF-like tandem domain of coagulation factor XII has been solved by X-ray crystallography. Crystal structures of the FXII light chain have also been determined, both unbound (β-FXII) and bound (β-FXIIa) to inhibitors.

== Function ==
Factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor) is a plasma glycoprotein of approximately 90 kDa and is part of the coagulation cascade. It activates factor XI and prekallikrein in vitro. FXII is activated to FXIIa by negatively charged surfaces such as glass, initiating the intrinsic pathway. FXII also plays a role in diagnostic coagulation assays called activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT).

In vivo, FXII is activated by binding to polyanions in a process termed contact activation. Various polymers, such as kaolin and glass, act as non-physiological activators of FXII. Activated platelets release inorganic polyphosphates, which activate FXII, initiating the intrinsic pathway and contributing to fibrin formation and thrombus development. Polyphosphates also accelerate thrombin-induced activation of factor XI.

Polyphosphate forms calcium-rich nanoparticles in vivo, which accumulate on platelets and activate FXII. The regulation of platelet polyphosphates is still not fully understood, but the phosphate-exporter XPR1 has been identified as a key regulator. Targeting XPR1 increases polyphosphate levels, accelerating thrombosis in mouse models.

Given FXII’s role in thrombosis while sparing hemostasis, it has become a target for anticoagulant drug development. Inhibitors targeting FXII are in clinical trials.
== Clinical significance ==

Factor XII deficiency is a rare disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Unlike other clotting factor deficiencies, factor XII deficiency is totally asymptomatic and does not cause excess bleeding. Mice lacking the gene for factor XII, however, are less susceptible to thrombosis. The protein seems to be involved in the later stages of clot formation rather than the first occlusion of damages in the blood vessel wall.

Factor XII does play an important role in clot formation during &quot;in vitro&quot; measurements of the partial thromboplastin time, which causes these measurements to be markedly prolonged in patients with factor XII deficiency, usually well beyond even what is seen in hemophilia A, hemophilia B, or factor XI deficiency. As a result, the main concern related to factor XII deficiency is the unnecessary testing, delay in care, worry, etc. that may be prompted by the abnormal lab result. All of this, including the mechanism of inheritance, also holds true for the other contact factors, prekallikrein (Fletcher factor) and high molecular weight kininogen.

Excess levels of factor XII can predispose individuals towards greater risk of venous thrombosis due to factor XII&#x27;s role as one of the catalysts for conversion of plasminogen to its active fibrinolytic form of plasmin.

Factor XII is also activated by endotoxins, especially lipid A in vitro. Experimental mouse models have suggested a role of FXII in multiple sclerosis.

== History ==

Hageman factor was first discovered in 1955 when a routine preoperative blood sample of the 37-year-old railroad brakeman John Hageman (1918) was found to have prolonged clotting time in test tubes, even though he had no hemorrhagic symptoms. Hageman was then examined by hematologist Oscar Ratnoff, who found that Hageman lacked a previously unidentified clotting factor. Ratnoff later found that the Hageman factor deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, after examining several related people who had the deficiency. Paradoxically, pulmonary embolism contributed to Hageman&#x27;s death after an occupational accident in 1968. Since then, case studies and clinical studies identified an association between thrombosis and Factor XII deficiency. Hepatocytes express blood coagulation factor XII.

Currently produced QuikClot products, produced and marketed primarily for use in battlefield medicine to treat penetrating trauma (such as gunshot wounds and stab wounds), and other injuries that are known to commonly cause exsanguination (such as blast injury), are used with the overarching goal of increasing the time between the blood loss occurring, and the patient succumbing to the blood loss. The purpose of increasing this time is so that the patient may reaching a higher level of medical care before succumbing from their injuries. These products use a Kaolinite-based coating, applied to the bandages by the manufacturer before packaging and sale. This coating, when applied to an open wound via the application of the bandages, directly promotes blood clotting by activating Factor XII in the coagulation cascade. Also, due to the active ingredient nature of Kaolinite, the activation of the Factor XII occurs in both an earlier amount of time than it otherwise would, and at an increased, more rapid rate than it otherwise would. This coating is widely considered amongst combat medics to be vastly superior to the older QuikClot powder formulation, which was poured into wounds, due to the fact that the older formulation used bead-form Zeolite, a mineral which promotes the coagulation cascade, due to the fact that the reaction between the Zeolite powder and the blood inside the wound site was an Exothermic one, sometimes so intensely that it caused cases of second degree burns on the inside surface of the wound. This, obviously, caused extreme pain to the patient, often more-so than the initial injury was causing them at the time (assuming the patient was still conscious at the time of the application of the powder). This effect is often seen in movies and TV programs, with the QuikClot powder being poured into wounds, and the patient screaming out in pain as their wounds were violently burned on the inside surface of the wounds. This created a common misconception, which persists to this day, that commonly used QuikClot products still use this method of clot promotion (Zeolite powder) to this day. However, Zeolite-based clotting products are no longer widely used by militaries and police departments throughout the western world, as they have been widely supplanted by the Kaolinite-based bandage products, which do not cause any exothermic reaction whatsoever, nor do they have the absolute-requirement of the application of the product exclusively to the inside-surface of the wound.

<doc id="538966" wikidata="Q2627542" url="?curid=538966" title="Jackson–Vanik amendment">
<text>The Jackson–Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 is a 1974 provision in United States federal law intended to affect U.S. trade relations with countries with non-market economies (originally, countries of the Soviet Bloc) that restrict freedom of Jewish emigration and other human rights. The amendment is contained in the Trade Act of 1974 which passed both houses of the United States Congress unanimously, and was signed by President Gerald Ford into law, with the adopted amendment, on January 3, 1975. Over time, a number of countries were granted conditional normal trade relations subject to annual review, and a number of countries were liberated from the amendment.

On December 14, 2012, President Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act (formally titled the Russia and Moldova Jackson–Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012) that repealed the application of the Jackson–Vanik amendment to Russia and gave normal US trade relations to Russia and Moldova, instead punishing individuals violating human rights.

The amendment is named after its major co-sponsors Henry M. Jackson of Washington in the Senate and Charles A. Vanik of Ohio in the House of Representatives, both Democrats.

==Background==
===Antisemitism in the Soviet Union under Brezhnev===
===Timeline===
From 1972 to January 1975, Congress debated and added the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which had restricted the president&#x27;s ability to provide most favored nation (MFN) status to the Soviet Union and other non-market economies of the Soviet bloc. The timing and provisions of the amendment reflected the presidential ambitions and distrust of the Soviet Union of Senator Henry Jackson (D-WA).

After the Soviet Union allowed a number of Soviet Jews to emigrate in the years after the 1967 June War in the Middle East, expectations of freer emigration to buttress Jewish settlers to Israel were raised, but they were soon shattered as the 1972 Soviet emigration head tax made emigration very difficult. This Soviet edict levied an additional exit tax on educated emigrants, which appeared to have the effect of singling out Jews, who anonymously had the highest state paid education costs and wealth, most heavily. The education tax, imposed after the 1972 Moscow summit of superpower leaders Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev, emboldened those who criticized the Nixon administration&#x27;s policy of detente for downplaying concerns for human rights. Nixon&#x27;s handling of the issue of Soviet Jewish emigration and US National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger&#x27;s reluctance to broach the subject disappointed US Jewish activists. The Soviets announced the abolishing of the tax just before the introduction of the amendment in Congress, arguably in an attempt to halt its enactment.

At first, Jackson organized the political movement to link trade and emigration in US relations with the Soviet Union in concert with Jewish activists, but he soon took matters into his own hands. Jackson drafted what would become the Jackson–Vanik amendment in mid-1972 and introduced it to the 92nd Congress on October 4, 1972. Jackson&#x27;s efforts, rooted in his own domestic political agenda and ideological distrust of and antipathy toward the Soviet Union, complicated the Nixon White House&#x27;s pursuit of detente, which it had worked on since 1969. However, three-quarters of the Senate co-sponsored the amendment, neutralizing opposition from President Nixon.

Jackson&#x27;s staffer Richard Perle said in an interview that the idea belonged to Jackson, who believed that the right to emigrate was the most powerful among the human rights in certain respects: &quot;if people could vote with their feet, governments would have to acknowledge that and governments would have to make for their citizens a life that would keep them there.&quot; While there was some opposition, the American Jewish establishment on the whole and Soviet Jewry activists (particularly the Washington Committee for Soviet Jewry and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry) supported the amendment over Nixon&#x27;s and Kissinger&#x27;s objections.

In 1973 Rep. Charles Vanik, chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, introduced in the House of Representatives the legislation drafted with Jackson. The amendment would deny normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to allow primarily Jewish refugees and other religious minorities to escape from the Soviet bloc. Vanik&#x27;s aide, Mark E. Talisman, is regarded as having played an instrumental role in securing passage.

Jackson attached his amendment to legislation the Nixon administration badly wanted. In the House of Representatives, Vanik lined up House leaders as primary sponsors of the amendment. During this period, Jackson also expanded his base of support, adding other ethnic, economic, and ideological groups as supporters. Labor, ethnic groups originally from Eastern European and Baltic States, human rights organizations and liberal intellectuals were the most significant additions to organized labor and Jewish activists. While building support, Jackson resisted compromise with the administration and the Soviet Union.

Once the Nixon administration began to appreciate the threat Jackson presented its policy of detente, and in particular the linkage of detente to expanded trade, it made a number of attempts to thwart Jackson. The administration tried to keep the amendment out of the committee version of the bill during the House Ways and Means Committee&#x27;s markup sessions. When it became clear that this was impossible, delay was the administration&#x27;s next option, along with the threat of a veto.

The Yom Kippur War in October 1973 further complicated Congressional views of the Soviet Union. Soviet involvement in the conflict may have stoked distrust of the USSR by some members of Congress, but there were other members who feared that pressure on the Nixon Administration to advance the goals of the Jackson–Vanik amendment complicated the emergency supply of US military weapons to Israel. Israel prevailed in the Yom Kippur War, and on December 11 the House of Representatives voted by an overwhelming 319-80 vote to include the entire Jackson–Vanik amendment in the trade bill, which passed 272–140. With that, Congress recessed until January 1974.

On January 21, 1974, the second session of the 93rd United States Congress began, and the Jackson amendment was introduced in the Senate. Having lost the legislative battle in the House of Representatives, the administration and Soviet authorities turned to negotiations with Jackson. Trilateral talks began in spring 1974 involving Congress, the Executive Branch and the Soviet Union. The prominent individuals involved were Jackson, Kissinger, and Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Dobrynin, a skilled senior diplomat who had served in Washington for decades. Kissinger enjoyed a special status in these negotiations since he alone controlled the communications between Jackson and the Soviet Union. In effect, Kissinger was the only one of the three parties involved who knew what all sides were saying in secret, informal sessions, while he also conducted a long-standing &quot;back channel&quot; dialogue with Soviet authorities via Dobrynin. Kissinger&#x27;s influence only grew as Nixon was increasingly consumed by the Watergate political scandal.

In March 1974, Kissinger returned from Moscow with news that the Soviets were willing to cooperate with the members of Congress. Jackson, however, would complicate matters by making public the demands that had been accommodated in quiet diplomatic dialogue.

Jackson pursued negotiations with the administration and the Soviet Union on the terms of the amendment. The outline of an agreement was perceivable, but by summer the talks seemed to bog down as Watergate sapped the Executive Branch&#x27;s political energy. Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.

In August 1974, when the national deadlock was broken by Nixon&#x27;s resignation and Ford&#x27;s appointment, Jackson had to decide whether or not to concur with an agreement that was not perfect or hold out longer and possibly sink the entire trade bill. Given the choice of having the bill with the Jackson amendment or doing away with both the bill and the Jackson amendment together, Kissinger was apparently willing to let the two die. So to compromise, Jackson had agreed to grant, at least temporarily, trade concessions, including extensions of credit, to the Soviet Union.

Eventually, Jackson accepted less than perfect terms. Jackson was anxious to achieve a legislative victory after years of battle and apparently decided it best not to ask too many more questions nor press too hard for less ambiguous pledges lest he be left with nothing to show for his efforts.

President Ford signed the 1972 Trade Agreement on January 3, 1975, with the Jackson amendment. On January 10, the Soviet government sent a letter that apparently indicated the Soviets&#x27; refusal to comply with the need to provide assurances on emigration or to make technical changes in the 1972 Trade Agreement. On January 13, Kissinger met with Soviet officials and subsequently issued a statement &quot;that the 1972 Trade Agreement cannot be brought into force at this time and the President will therefore not take the steps required for this purpose by the Trade Agreement. The President does not plan at this time to exercise the waiver authority.&quot;

===Business involvement===
Harry Stone, vice president and his brother, Irving Stone, president of American Greetings based in Vanick&#x27;s home town, Cleveland, Ohio, played a major role in gaining sponsorship for the amendment. Harry Stone served as campaign chairman to the late U.S. Representative Charles Vanik, a connection that gained significance when Vanik asked Stone and his brother Irving, then American Greetings president, to encourage congressman Wilbur Mills to schedule a floor vote on the Jackson-Vanik Amendment requiring the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration to the U.S. in order to qualify for &quot;most favored nation status&quot; for its exports. Senator J. William Fulbright, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee characterized the amendment as &quot;idealistic meddling&quot; in the amendment&#x27;s attempts to use free Jews using trade and credit as levers against the Soviet Union. American Greetings was the largest employer in Mills&#x27;s Arkansas district. Fulbright, apparently saw the same light as Mills, as American Greetings opened one of its largest printing plants in Fulbright&#x27;s and Mills&#x27;s state of Arkansas.

&quot;The role that Harry Stone played in making the Jackson-Vanik bill a reality will go down as one of the most meaningful contributions that a Clevelander has ever made,&quot; says Vic Gelb, an honorary for life director of the Cleveland Jewish News. &quot;It made a world of difference in the history of events and enabled the exodus of Jews from the former Soviet Union.&quot;

===Conclusion===
The difficulty faced by Senator Jackson in the three-way negotiation process that took place from August 1974 through January 1975, demonstrated some of the institutional constraints on congressional involvement in foreign policy making. The Jackson–Vanik amendment is a case study of how domestic politics shapes American Foreign policy making. It exemplifies the fact that one cannot understand U.S. foreign policy if one does not understand the domestic politics in Congress and the White House that shape policy decisions.

==Content==
The amendment denied most favored nation status to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted emigration, which is considered a human right. Permanent normal trade relations can have been extended to such country only if the president determined that it complies with the freedom of emigration requirements. However, the president had authority to grant an annual waiver, which was granted to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the late 1970s and to Vietnam and Laos in later decades.

The core provision of the amendment was codified as 19 U.S.C. 2432(a), Sec. 402 &quot;Freedom of Emigration in East-West Trade&quot; of the Trade Act of 1974 ():

(a) Actions of nonmarket economy countries making them ineligible for normal trade relations, programs of credits, credit guarantees, or investment guarantees, or commercial agreements To assure the continued dedication of the United States to fundamental human rights, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or after January 3, 1975, products from any nonmarket economy country shall not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations), such country shall not participate in any program of the Government of the United States which extends credits or credit guarantees or investment guarantees, directly or indirectly, and the President of the United States shall not conclude any commercial agreement with any such country, during the period beginning with the date on which the President determines that such country -
:(1) denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate;
:(2) imposes more than a nominal tax on emigration or on the visas or other documents required for emigration, for any purpose or cause whatsoever; or
:(3) imposes more than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any citizen as a consequence of the desire of such citizen to emigrate to the country of his choice,
and ending on the date on which the President determines that such country is no longer in violation of paragraph (1), (2), or (3).

==Effects==

The countries subject to the amendment included the Soviet Union (and later the post-Soviet states), the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Albania, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.

Of Soviet Bloc countries, Poland was exempt from the amendment, but from 1982 to 1987 its unconditional MFN status was suspended due to its actions against Solidarność. Yugoslavia was also exempt; however, in 1991–1992, due to violent events in the former Yugoslavia, the MFN status of Serbia and Montenegro was suspended.

===Soviet Union===

At first the Jackson–Vanik amendment did little to help free Soviet Jewry. The number of exit visas declined after the passing of the amendment. However, in the late 1980s Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to comply with the protocols of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Lazin (2005) states that scholars differ on how effective the amendment was in helping Soviet Jews. Some argue that it helped bring the plight of Soviet Jews to the world&#x27;s attention, while others believe it hindered emigration and decreased America&#x27;s diplomatic bargaining power.

Since 1975 more than 500,000 refugees, large numbers of whom were Jews, evangelical Christians, and Catholics from the former Soviet Union, have been resettled in the United States. An estimated one million Soviet Jews have immigrated to Israel in that time.

Jackson–Vanik also led to great changes within the Soviet Union. Other ethnic groups subsequently demanded the right to emigrate, and the ruling Communist Party had to face the fact that there was widespread dissatisfaction with its governance.

Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky wrote in his 2004 book &quot;The Case for Democracy&quot; (p. 3):

===Lautenberg Amendment (1990)===
After Boris Perchatkin’s speeches in the US Congress in 1989 Frank Lautenberg suggested the Lautenberg Amendment, Public Law 101–167, enacted on November 21, 1989, took effect in 1990 which provided refugee status in the United States for nationals from the Soviet Union and later the former Soviet Union, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania who are Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian Catholics or Ukrainian Orthodox; as well as nationals of Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia; and Jews, Christians, Baha’is and other religious minorities from Iran. The Lautenberg measure allowed refugee status to people from historically persecuted groups without requiring them to show that they had been singled out. Under the Lautenberg Amendment, 350,000 to 400,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union who had not presented any form of evidence of persecution gained entry to the United States by October 2002 according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Beginning in 2002, a special &quot;Refugee Corps&quot; in the Department of Homeland Security handled issues involving the Lautenberg Amendment.

===Post-soviet states===
====Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania====
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were subject to the amendment because they had been forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. They were liberated from the amendment upon the US recognition of their independence on September 6, 1991.

====Kazakhstan====
Kazakhstan&#x27;s Jewish community reportedly requested the US to cancel Jackson Vanik amendment for Kazakhstan. In an article titled &quot;A Relic of the Cold War&quot;, journalist Robert Guttman refers to the Amendment as an &quot;outdated and rather meaningless piece of legislation&quot;. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argues that the application of Jackson-Vanik on Kazakhstan puts U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. The Chamber urges the U.S. Congress to graduate Kazakhstan from Jackson-Vanik.

====Kyrgyzstan====
Kyrgyzstan first received conditional normal trade relations in 1992. In 1997 it was found fully compliant with the Jackson-Vanik provisions, but its status remained subject to annual review. On May 18, 2000, Public Law 106-200 authorized the President to extend unconditional normal trade relations to Kyrgyzstan.

====Moldova====
Moldova first received conditional normal trade relations in 1992. In 1997 it was found to be fully compliant with the Jackson-Vanik provisions, but its status remained subject to annual review.

On November 16, 2012 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would repeal the Jackson–Vanik amendment for Russia and Moldova. After approval by the Senate, the law repealing the effects of the Jackson–Vanik amendment on Russia and Moldova was signed by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012.

====Russia====
In 2003, Vladimir Putin pursued an economic agenda for Russia to begin normalized trade relations with the West which included Russia joining the European Union and the repeal of the Jackson–Vanik amendment. Putin tried to use his relationships with both the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was the head of the European Union&#x27;s Council in 2003, to gain Russia&#x27;s membership in the European Union, and also Hank Greenberg, who was the chairman and CEO of the American International Group (AIG), to repeal the Jackson-Vanik provisions in the United States. Putin wished for Greenberg to support through Greenberg&#x27;s AIG greater development of the nascent Russian home-mortgage market.

On November 16, 2012 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would repeal the Jackson–Vanik amendment for Russia and Moldova. After approval by the Senate, the law repealing the effects of the Jackson–Vanik amendment on Russia and Moldova was signed together with Magnitsky bill by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012.

====Ukraine====
On March 8, 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill permanently exempting Ukraine from trade restrictions imposed under the 1974 Jackson–Vanik amendment.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Until the accession of the PRC to the World Trade Organization in December 2001 the PRC was covered by the provisions of Jackson-Vanik. Before China&#x27;s crackdown on the Tiananmen protests of 1989, a waiver was granted to China as a routine matter. After the crackdown, the waiver became a more contentious issue. As part of the 2001 WTO entry agreement for China, China received permanent normal trade relations and the Jackson-Vanik amendment no longer applied.

==U.S. legal challenge==
In April 2011, American University in Moscow professor Eduard Lozansky and former Reagan administration official Antony Salvia filed a federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C. against the Obama administration arguing the law is illegal.

<text>Disaronno Originale (28% ABV, 56 proof) is a type of amaretto—an amber-colored liqueur with a characteristic almond taste, although it does not actually contain almonds. It is produced in Saronno, in the Lombardy region of Italy, by ILLVA Saronno and is sold worldwide. According to the company, the liqueur is an infusion of apricot kernel oil with &quot;absolute alcohol, burnt sugar, and the pure essence of seventeen selected herbs and fruits&quot;. The liqueur is sold in an oblong glass decanter designed by a craftsman from Murano.

The product was called Amaretto di Saronno (Amaretto from Saronno) until 2001, when it was rebranded as &quot;Disaronno Originale&quot; for marketing reasons.

Disaronno can be served neat as a liqueur, on the rocks, or as part of a cocktail mixed with other alcoholic beverages, cola, ginger ale, or fruit juice. It may also be added to hot chocolate and is an ingredient in the Italian variant of an Irish coffee. The amaretto liqueur can also be used in the Italian dessert tiramisu.

Disaronno Velvet, a cream liqueur, was introduced in 2020 (17% ABV, 34 proof).

<doc id="538980" wikidata="Q2634647" url="?curid=538980" title="Gregory Nagy">
<text>Gregory Nagy (, ; born October 22, 1942, in Budapest) is an American professor of Classics at Harvard University, specializing in Homer and archaic Greek poetry. Nagy is known for extending Milman Parry and Albert Lord&#x27;s theories about the oral composition-in-performance of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Education and career==
Nagy received his A.B. from Indiana University in 1962 in classics and linguistics, and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1966 in classical philology.

Since 1966, he has been a professor at Harvard University.

Since 2000, he has been the director of the Center for Hellenic Studies, a Harvard-affiliated research institution in Washington, D.C. He is the Francis Jones Professor of Classical Greek Literature and Professor of Comparative literature at Harvard, and continues to teach half-time at the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1994 to 2000, he served as Chair of the Classics Department at Harvard University. He was Chair of Harvard&#x27;s undergraduate Literature Concentration from 1989 to 1994. He served as the president of the American Philological Association in the academic year 1990-1991.

From 2015 to 2021, he posted about his work on a frequent basis at his research blog, &quot;Classical Inquiries&quot;.

==Massive open online course==
In 2013 Harvard offered his popular class, The Ancient Greek Hero, which thousands of Harvard students had taken over the last few decades, through edX as a massive open online course. To assist Professor Nagy, Harvard appealed to alumni to volunteer as online mentors and discussion group managers. About 10 former teaching fellows have also volunteered. The task of the volunteers is to focus online class discussion on the course material. The course had 27,000 students registered.

==Personal life==
Nagy and his wife, Olga Davidson, Research Fellow, Institute for the Study of Muslim Societies and Civilizations, Boston University and chair of the Ilex Foundation, served as Faculty Deans (previously called co-masters) of Currier House at Harvard from 1986 to 1990.

Nagy has two brothers in allied fields: Blaise Nagy is a professor emeritus of Classics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, while Joseph F. Nagy is the Henry L. Shattuck Professor of Irish Studies in the Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University.

<doc id="538986" wikidata="Q3849264" url="?curid=538986" title="Glubbdubdrib">
<text>Glubbdubdrib (also spelled Glubdubdrib or Glubbdubdribb in some editions) was an island of sorcerers and magicians, one of the imaginary countries visited by Lemuel Gulliver in the 1726 satirical novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Anglo-Irish author Jonathan Swift. The episode on Glubbdubdrib &quot;explores the theme of humanity&#x27;s progressive degeneration.&quot;

==Location==
The location of Glubdubdrib is illustrated in both the text and the map at the beginning of part III of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, though they are not consistent with each other. 
The map shows Glubdubdrib to be southwest of the port of Maldonada on the southwest coast of Luggnagg, while the text states the island is southwest of Balnibarbi, and Maldonada to be a port of that land.

==Description==
Glubbdubdrib is about one third as large as the Isle of Wight. The inhabitants of Glubbdubdrib can wield magic, and most of their technology is utilized through magical means. The eldest in succession is prince or governor of the island. He has a &#x27;noble&#x27; palace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty foot high.

On visiting Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver had the occasion, thanks to the power of their necromancers, to speak with Brutus of ancient Rome, whom Gulliver greatly admired, among many other famous historical personages, including Socrates. Many ideas of historians were corrected this way. Gulliver spends five days doing this, then three days looking at some of the &#x27;modern&#x27; dead, trying to find the greatest figure in the past 200 or 300 years in his country and others in Europe. Gulliver gets a new view of historians and heroes, claiming &#x27;I was chiefly disgusted with modern History&#x27;.

<text>Casper (with the same sounding Kasper) is a family and personal name derived from Aramaic that means &quot;Treasurer&quot;. The origins of the name have been traced as far back as the Old Testament and variations of the name have been adopted by a variety of cultures and languages.

==Origins==

The name is derived from Gaspar which in turn is from an ancient Chaldean word, &quot;gizbar&quot;, which according to Strong&#x27;s Concordance means &quot;treasurer&quot;. The word &quot;gizbar&quot; appears in the Hebrew version of the Old Testament Book of Ezra (1:8). In fact, the modern Hebrew word for &quot;treasurer&quot; is still (). By the 1st century B.C. the Septuagint gave a Greek translation of &quot;gizbar&quot; in Ezra 1:8 as &quot;gasbarinou&quot; (literally, &quot;son of Gasbar&quot;). The transition from &quot;Gizbar&quot; to &quot;Caspar&quot; and &quot;Kaspar&quot; can thus be summarized as: Gizbar→Gasbar→Gaspar→Caspar→Kaspar... with &quot;C&quot; being a misreading of the manuscript &quot;G&quot; and &quot;K&quot; having the same phonetic value as &quot;C&quot;. 

There are numerous modern variations such as Gaspar (Catalan, Portuguese and Spanish), Gaspare (Italian), Gaspard (French), Kaspar (Dutch, German), Kašpar (Czech), Casper (Dutch, English), Caspar (Dutch), Kacper (Polish), Kasperi (Finnish), Kasper (Danish, Swedish), Gáspár (Hungarian), Гаспар (Russian) and Kaspars (Latvian).

By the 6th century, the name &quot;Gaspar&quot; was recorded in mosaic at the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, Italy as one of the traditional names assigned by folklore to the anonymous Magi mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew account of the Nativity of Jesus. The letter &quot;G&quot; in the name Gaspar was clearly different from the letter &quot;C&quot; used elsewhere, suggesting that the name Gaspar preceded the name Caspar, and not the other way around as some have supposed.

The Western tradition of the name &quot;Gaspar&quot; also derives from an early 6th century Greek manuscript, Gaspar

<doc id="538993" wikidata="Q1346016" url="?curid=538993" title="Pernicious anemia">
<text>Pernicious anemia is a disease where not enough red blood cells are produced due to a deficiency of vitamin B12. Those affected often have a gradual onset. The most common initial symptoms are feeling tired and weak. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, feeling faint, a smooth red tongue, pale skin, chest pain, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, heartburn, numbness in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, memory loss, muscle weakness, poor reflexes, blurred vision, clumsiness, depression, and confusion. Without treatment, some of these problems may become permanent. 

Pernicious anemia refers to a type of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia that results from lack of intrinsic factor. Lack of intrinsic factor is most commonly due to an autoimmune attack on the cells that create it in the stomach. It can also occur following the surgical removal of all or part of the stomach or small intestine; from an inherited disorder or illnesses that damage the stomach lining. When suspected, diagnosis is made by blood tests initially a complete blood count, and occasionally, bone marrow tests. Blood tests may show fewer but larger red blood cells, low numbers of young red blood cells, low levels of vitamin B12, and antibodies to intrinsic factor. Diagnosis is not always straightforward and can be challenging.
Because pernicious anemia is due to a lack of intrinsic factor, it is not preventable. Pernicious anemia can be treated with injections of vitamin B12. If the symptoms are serious, frequent injections are typically recommended initially. There are not enough studies that pills are effective in improving or eliminating symptoms. Often, treatment may be needed for life.
Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of clinically evident vitamin B12 deficiency worldwide. Pernicious anemia due to autoimmune problems occurs in about one per 1000 people in the US. Among those over the age of 60, about 2% have the condition. It more commonly affects people of northern European descent. Women are more commonly affected than men. With proper treatment, most people live normal lives. Due to a higher risk of stomach cancer, those with pernicious anemia should be checked regularly for this. The first clear description was by Thomas Addison in 1849. The term &quot;pernicious&quot; means &quot;deadly&quot;, and this term came into use because, before the availability of treatment, the disease was often fatal.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Pernicious anemia often presents slowly, and can cause harm insidiously and unnoticeably. Untreated, it can lead to neurological complications, and in serious cases, death. The onset may be vague and slow and the condition can be confused with other conditions, and there may be few to many symptoms without anemia. Pernicious anemia may be present without a person experiencing symptoms at first, over time, feeling tired and weak, lightheadedness, dizziness, headaches, rapid or irregular heartbeat, breathlessness, glossitis (a sore red tongue), poor ability to exercise, low blood pressure, cold hands and feet, pale or yellow skin, easy bruising and bleeding, low-grade fevers, tremor, cold sensitivity, chest pain, upset stomach, nausea, loss of appetite, heartburn, weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, severe joint pain, feeling abnormal sensations including tingling or numbness to the fingers and toes (&quot;pins and needles&quot;), and tinnitus, may occur. Anemia may present with a number of further common symptoms, including hair thinning and loss, early greying of the hair, mouth ulcers, bleeding gums, angular cheilitis, a look of exhaustion with pale and dehydrated or cracked lips and dark circles around the eyes, as well as brittle nails.

In more severe or prolonged cases of pernicious anemia, nerve cell damage may occur. This is may result in sense loss, difficulty in proprioception, neuropathic pain, difficulty walking, poor balance, loss of sensation in the feet, muscle weakness, blurred vision (either due to retinopathy or optic neuropathy), impaired urination, fertility problems, decreased sense of taste and smell, decreased level of consciousness, changes in reflexes, memory loss, mood swings, depression, irritability, cognitive impairment, confusion, anxiety, clumsiness, psychosis, and, in more severe cases, dementia. Anemia may also lead to cardiac murmurs and/or altered blood pressure (low or high). The deficiency may also present with thyroid disorders. In severe cases, the anemia may cause congestive heart failure. A complication of severe chronic PA is subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, which leads to distal sensory loss (posterior column), absent ankle reflex, increased knee reflex response, and extensor plantar response. Other than anemia, hematological symptoms may include cytopenias, intramedullary hemolysis, and pseudothrombotic microangiopathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency, which is reversible, is occasionally confused with acute myeloid leukemia, which is an irreversible condition presenting with some of the same hematological symptoms, including hypercellular bone marrow with blastic differentiation and hypersegmented neutrophils. Pernicious anemia can cause osteoporosis and may lead to bone fractures. Pernicious anemia can contribute to a delay in physical growth in children, and may also be a cause for delay in puberty for adolescents.

== Causes ==
Vitamin B12 cannot be produced by the human body, and must be obtained from the diet. When foods containing B12 are eaten, the vitamin is usually bound to protein and is released by proteases released by the pancreas into the small bowel. Following its release, most B12 is absorbed by the body in the small bowel (ileum) after binding to a protein known as intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is produced by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa (stomach lining) and the intrinsic factor-B12-complex is absorbed by enterocytes in the ileum&#x27;s cubam receptors. PA is characterised by B12 deficiency caused by the absence of intrinsic factor. Other disorders that can disrupt the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine include celiac disease, surgical removal of crohn&#x27;s disease, and HIV.
PA may be considered as an end stage of autoimmune atrophic gastritis, a disease characterised by stomach atrophy and the presence of antibodies to parietal cells and intrinsic factor. Autoimmune atrophic gastritis, is localised to the body of the stomach, where parietal cells are located. Antibodies to intrinsic factor and parietal cells cause the destruction of the oxyntic gastric mucosa, in which the parietal cells are located, leading to the subsequent loss of intrinsic factor synthesis. Without intrinsic factor, the ileum can no longer absorb the B12. Atrophic gastritis is often a precursor to gastric cancer.

Although the exact role of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection in PA remains controversial, evidence indicates &quot;H. pylori&quot; is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. A long-standing &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection may cause gastric autoimmunity by a mechanism known as molecular mimicry. Antibodies produced by the immune system can be cross-reactive and may bind to both &quot;H. pylori&quot; antigens and those found in the gastric mucosa. The antibodies are produced by activated B cells that recognise both pathogen and self-derived peptides. The autoantigens believed to cause the autoreactivity are the alpha and beta subunits of the sodium-potassium pump. In a study, B12 deficiency caused by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; was positively correlated with CagA positivity and gastric inflammatory activity, rather than gastric atrophy. Less commonly, &quot;H. pylori&quot; and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may cause a form of nonautoimmune gastritis that can lead to pernicious anemia.

Impaired B12 absorption can also occur following gastric removal (gastrectomy) or gastric bypass surgery. In these surgeries, either the parts of the stomach that produce gastric secretions are removed or they are bypassed. This means intrinsic factor, as well as other factors required for B12 absorption, are not available. However, B12 deficiency after gastric surgery does not usually become a clinical issue. This is probably because the body stores many years&#x27; worth of B12 in the liver and gastric surgery patients are adequately supplemented with the vitamin.

Although no specific PA susceptibility genes have been identified, a genetic factor likely is involved in the disease. Pernicious anemia is often found in conjunction with other autoimmune disorders, suggesting common autoimmune susceptibility genes may be a causative factor. In spite of that, previous family studies and case reports focusing on PA have suggested that there is a tendency of genetic heritance of PA in particular, and close relatives of the PA patients seem to have higher incidence of PA and associated PA conditions. Moreover, it was further indicated that the formation of antibodies to gastric cells was autosomal dominant gene determined, and the presence of antibodies to the gastric cells might not be necessarily related to the occurrence of atrophic gastritis related to PA.

== Pathophysiology ==
Although the healthy body stores three to five years&#x27; worth of B12 in the liver, the usually undetected autoimmune activity in one&#x27;s gut over a prolonged period of time leads to B12 depletion and the resulting anemia; pernicious anemia refers to one of the hematologic manifestations of chronic auto-immune gastritis, in which the immune system targets the parietal cells of the stomach or intrinsic factor itself, leading to decreased absorption of vitamin B12. The body needs enough intrinsic factor to absorb and reabsorb vitamin B12 from the bile, the lack of which reduces the time needed to develop a deficiency.

B12 is required by enzymes for two reactions: the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. In the latter reaction, the methyl group of levomefolic acid is transferred to homocysteine to produce tetrahydrofolate and methionine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase with B12 as an essential cofactor. During B12 deficiency, this reaction cannot proceed, which leads to the accumulation of levomefolic acid. This accumulation depletes the other types of folate required for purine and thymidylate synthesis, which are required for the synthesis of DNA. Inhibition of DNA replication in maturing red blood cells results in the formation of large, fragile megaloblastic erythrocytes. The neurological aspects of the disease are thought to arise from the accumulation of methylmalonyl- CoA due to the requirement of B12 as a cofactor to the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.

== Diagnosis ==

The insidious nature of PA may mean that diagnosis is delayed. Diagnosis is not always straightforward and can be challenging and can take up to several years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and almost 60% of those affected are misdiagnosed or not initially diagnosed at all. PA may be suspected when a patient&#x27;s blood smear shows large, fragile, immature erythrocytes, known as megaloblasts. A diagnosis of PA first requires demonstration of megaloblastic anemia by conducting a full blood count and blood smear, which evaluates the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), as well the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). PA is identified with a high MCV (macrocytic anemia) and a normal MCHC (normochromic anemia). Ovalocytes are also typically seen on the blood smear, and a pathognomonic feature of megaloblastic anemias (which include PA and others) is hypersegmented neutrophils. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can precede hematological signs and are often the presenting manifestation of the disease.

Vitamin B12 serum levels are used to detect its deficiency, but do not distinguish its causes. Vitamin B12 levels can be falsely high or low and data for sensitivity and specificity vary widely. Normal serum levels may be found in cases of deficiency where myeloproliferative disorders, liver disease, transcobalamin II, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth are present. Low levels of serum vitamin B12 may be caused by other factors than B12 deficiency, such as folate deficiency, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, haptocorrin deficiency, and myeloma. High serum levels may caused by supplementing with vitamin B12, present of antibodies to intrinsic factor, or due to underlying condition.

The presence of antibodies to gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor is common in PA. Parietal cell antibodies are found in other autoimmune disorders and also in up to 10% of healthy individuals. However, around 85% of PA patients have parietal cell antibodies, which means they are a sensitive marker for the disease. Intrinsic factor antibodies are much less sensitive than parietal cell antibodies, but they are much more specific. They are found in about half of PA patients and are very rarely found in other disorders. These antibody tests can distinguish between PA and food-B12 malabsorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1309/CVHKLE2R4W68K2NQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A buildup of certain metabolites occurs in B12 deficiency due to its role in metabolic processes and cellular functions. Methylmalonic acid (MMA) can be measured in both the blood and urine, whereas homocysteine is only measured in the blood. An increase in both MMA and homocysteine distinguishes B12deficiency from folate deficiency because homocysteine alone increases in the latter.

Elevated gastrin levels can be found in around 80–90% of PA cases, but they may also be found in other forms of gastritis. Decreased pepsinogen I levels or a decreased pepsinogen I to pepsinogen II ratio may also be found, although these findings are less specific to PA and can be found in food-B12 malabsorption and other forms of gastritis.

The diagnosis of atrophic gastritis type A should be confirmed by gastroscopy and stepwise biopsy. About 90% of individuals with PA have antibodies for parietal cells; however, only 50% of all individuals in the general population with these antibodies have pernicious anemia.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Forms of vitamin B12 deficiency other than PA must be considered in the differential diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia. For example, a B12-deficient state which causes megaloblastic anemia and which may be mistaken for classical PA may be caused by infection with the tapeworm &quot;Diphyllobothrium latum&quot;, possibly due to the parasite&#x27;s competition with host for vitamin B12.

The classic test for PA, the Schilling test, is no longer widely used, as more efficient methods are available. This historic test consisted, in its first step, of taking an oral dose of radiolabelled vitamin B12, followed by quantitation of the vitamin in the patient&#x27;s urine over a 24-hour period via measurement of the radioactivity. A second step of the test repeats the regimen and procedure of the first step, with the addition of oral intrinsic factor. A patient with PA presents lower than normal amounts of intrinsic factor; hence, addition of intrinsic factor in the second step results in an increase in vitamin B12 absorption (over the baseline established in the first). The Schilling test distinguished PA from other forms of B12 deficiency, specifically, from Imerslund–Gräsbeck syndrome, a B12-deficiency caused by mutations in &quot;CUBN&quot; that codes for cubilin the cobalamin receptor.

vitamin B12 deficiency is also prevalent in patients having Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD) so it should be differentiated.

== Treatment ==

Pernicious anemia is usually easily treated by providing the necessary level of vitamin B12 supplementation. Pernicious anemia can be treated with intramuscular injections of vitamin B12. Initially in high daily doses, followed by less frequent lower doses, as the condition improves. Activity may need to be limited during the course of treatment. As long as the body is saturated with vitamin B12 expected to result in cessation of anemia-related symptoms and there are no other symptoms, unless there are irreversible neurological complications. There are not enough studies on whether pills are as effective in improving or eliminating symptoms as parenteral treatment. Folate supplementation may affect the course and treatment of pernicious anemia if vitamin B12 not replaced. In some severe cases of anemia, a blood transfusion may be needed to resolve haematological effects. Treatment is lifelong.

The treatment of PA varies by country and area. Opinions vary over the efficacy of administration (parenteral/oral), the amount and time interval of the doses, or the forms of vitamin B12 (e.g. cyanocobalamin/hydroxocobalamin). More comprehensive studies are still needed in order to validate the feasibility of a particular therapeutic method for PA in clinical practices.

== Prognosis ==
A person with well-treated PA can live a healthy life. Failure to diagnose and treat in time, however, may result in permanent neurological damage, excessive fatigue, depression, memory loss, and other complications. In severe cases, the neurological complications of pernicious anemia can lead to death – hence the name, &quot;&quot;, meaning deadly.

There is an increased risk of gastric cancer in those with pernicious anemia linked to the common feature of atrophic gastritis.

== Epidemiology ==
PA is estimated to affect 0.1% of the general population and 1.9% of those over 60, accounting for 20–50% of B12 deficiency in adults. A review of literature shows that the prevalence of PA is higher in Northern Europe, especially in Scandinavian countries, and among people of African descent, and that increased awareness of the disease and better diagnostic tools might play a role in apparently higher rates of incidence.

== History ==
A case of anemia with a first recognition of associated atrophic gastritis a feature of pernicious anemia, was first described in 1824 by James Combe. This was fully investigated in 1849, by British physician Thomas Addison, from which it acquired the common name of &quot;Addison&#x27;s anemia&quot;. In 1871, the first accurate description of the disease in continental Europe was made by Michael Anton Biermer, a German physician who noted the insidious course of the condition. Because it was untreatable and fatal at the time, he first referred to it as &quot;pernicious&quot; anemia. Russell coined the term subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord.

In 1907, Richard Clarke Cabot reported on a series of 1,200 patients with PA; their average survival was between one and three years. Pernicious anemia was a fatal disease before about the year 1920; until the importance of the liver in hematopoiesis was recognized, the treatment of pernicious anemia was unsuccessful and arbitrary. It may have motivated George Whipple, who had a keen interest in liver diseases, to investigate the liver&#x27;s role in hematopoiesis. Whipple began evaluating the effects of treatments for anemia caused by chronic blood loss. Whipple, Huber, and Robchett studied the effects on hemoglobin and blood regeneration of a variety of treatments, among which only raw liver showed real promise. Serendipity is said to have played a role in this discovery. Whipple observed that blood regeneration was poor in dogs fed cooked liver after chronic blood loss. Had it not been that a lazy laboratory technician gave the dogs raw liver, the much more dramatic response might not have been discovered then.
Around 1926, George Minot and William P. Murphy, who learned of Whipple&#x27;s discovery, sought raw liver as a treatment for pernicious anemia. They later suggested a high-protein diet with high amounts of raw liver. This caused a rapid improvement in symptoms and a simultaneous rise in red blood cell counts. Fruit and iron were also part of the diet, and it appears that at this point, Minot and Murphy were not quite sure that the liver was a very important factor. It was thought that iron in liver tissue, not liver juice-soluble factor, cured hemorrhagic anemia in dogs. Thus, the discovery of liver juice as a treatment for pernicious anemia had been by coincidence. However, Minot, Murphy, and Whipple received the joint Nobel Prize for discovering a cure for a previously fatal disease of unknown cause in 1934, becoming the first Americans to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.

It is not easy to eat uncooked liver, and extracts were developed as a concentrate of liver juice for intramuscular injection. In 1928, chemist Edwin Cohn prepared an extract that was 50 to 100 times stronger than obtained from raw liver. This became part of the standard management of pernicious anemia until the 1950s. The active ingredient in the liver remained unknown until 1948. The anti-pernicious anemia factor was only isolated from the liver by Smith, Rex, and others. The substance was cobalamin, which the discoverers called &quot;vitamin B12&quot;. They showed that giving a few micrograms could prevent relapse in the disease. Dorothy Hodgkin and co-workers went on to use X-ray crystallography to elucidate the structure of cobalamin for which she, too, was awarded a Nobel Prize.

Understanding of the pathogenesis of pernicious anaemia increased over subsequent decades. It had long been known that the disease was associated with defects in the gastrointestinal tract: patients had chronic gastritis and lack of acid secretion (achlorhydria). It is known that transport of physiological amounts of vitamin B12 depends on the combined actions of gastric, ileal and pancreatic components. The gastric moiety was discovered and named &#x27;intrinsic factor&#x27; by William Castle in 1930. A further important advance was made in the early 1960s by Doniach with the recognition that pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease. Pernicious anemia is eventually treated with only injections of B12; injections are typically 1 mg every other day, or twice weekly.

A medical author takes the view that Mary Todd Lincoln, the wife of American President Abraham Lincoln, had pernicious anemia for decades and died from it in 1882.

===Permeation enhancers===
Treatment using oral drugs is an easier option in management but the bioavailability of vitamin B12 is low. This is due to low absorption in the intestine, and breakdown by enzyme activity. Research continues to focus on the use of permeation enhancers or permeation absorbers in combination with the treatment. One of the better performing enhancers studied is &quot;salcoprozate sodium&quot; (SNAC). SNAC is able to form a noncovalent complex with cobalamin while preserving its chemical integrity and protect vitamin B12 from gastric acidity. This complex is much more lipophilic than the water-soluble vitamin B12, so is able to pass through cellular membranes with greater ease. Molecular dynamics are used in experiments to gain an understanding of the molecular interactions involved in the different molecules used and the degree of ease achieved in absorption across the gastric epithelium.

<text>Davidoff is a Swiss premium brand of cigars, cigarettes and smoker&#x27;s accessories. The Davidoff cigarette brand has been owned by Imperial Brands after purchasing it in 2006. The non-cigarette portion of the Davidoff tobacco brand is owned by Oettinger Davidoff AG, which is based in Basel, Switzerland.

Oettinger Davidoff AG manufactures cigars, cigarillos, pipe tobaccos and smoker&#x27;s accessories under the brands Davidoff, Camacho and Zino Platinum. The cigars are produced in the Dominican Republic and Honduras, and tobacco is sourced from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, Honduras and the United States of America.

==Name==

The brand name Davidoff originates from the surname of its Swiss-Jewish-born founder, Zino Davidoff (born Sussele-Meier Davidoff; 1906, Novhorod-Siverskyi – 1994, Geneva), who ran a tobacco specialist shop in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1926 to 1994. He was known as the &quot;King of Cigars&quot;.

== History ==
After the Second World War, Zino Davidoff decided to acquire a licence to produce his own series of cigars. As he had discerning international customers, he named the various formats of this &quot;Château&quot; cigar series after famous Bordeaux vineyard estates. The first in the series was the &quot;Château Latour&quot; in 1946.

In 1967, Zino Davidoff was approached by Cubatabaco, Cuba&#x27;s state tobacco monopoly, about creating a line of cigars carrying the &quot;Davidoff&quot; name. The cigars were rolled in the newly established El Laguito factory in Havana, which had been established to roll Cuban President Fidel Castro&#x27;s own personal cigars, named Cohíba.

In 1968, the first cigars carrying the name &quot;Davidoff&quot; were released. The first formats were the No. 1, the No. 2 and the Ambassadrice. In 1970, Oettinger AG, located in Basel, Switzerland, acquired the rights to the Davidoff trademark.

In 1971, the Davidoff &quot;Mini Cigarillos&quot; (short fillers made of 100% tobacco) and, in 1972, the first Davidoff pipe tobaccos were released. As of 1975, the cigars of the Château series were delivered in cabinets bearing the Davidoff logo.

In 1976, the &quot;Mille Series&quot; and, in 1977, the “Dom Pérignon” cigar, named after the champagne, were released. In 1986, a limited release of &quot;Anniversario&quot; cigars were produced, to celebrate Zino Davidoff&#x27;s 80th birthday.

The Zino Davidoff Group was spun out of Davidoff in 1980 to exclusively market non-tobacco luxury goods such as watches, leather goods, pens, fragrances, eyewear, coffee, and cognac. Public health researchers have suggested that this was in order to engage in trademark diversification (also known as &quot;brand stretching&quot;) to promote the tobacco products, because it allows for advertising the brand in the face of restrictions on the direct promotion of tobacco products.

After numerous disputes over quality and ownership rights, Zino Davidoff and Cubatabaco decided to end their relationship. Leading up to this, in August 1989, Zino had publicly burned over one hundred thousand cigars that he had deemed of low quality and unfit to sell. All Davidoff products produced in Cuba were officially discontinued in 1991. An agreement was signed that no more Davidoff cigars from Cuba would be sold.

In 1990, after discontinuing Cuban-made products, Davidoff started to produce cigars in the Dominican Republic. After numerous test runs, Zino Davidoff found a partner in the local producer “Tabadom”, owned by Hendrik Kelner.

In 1991, the first Dominican-made Davidoff cigars were launched, continuing the product lines and cigar formats of their Cuban predecessors. With the move to the Dominican Republic, the Château series was renamed &quot;Grand Cru&quot;, and the individual formats were numbered instead of carrying the names of vineyard estates.

In 1991, the limited release called &quot;Aniversario&quot; became an ongoing cigar series, called the &quot;Aniversario&quot; series. In 1992, the &quot;Special&quot; cigar series was released, with the format &quot;Special R&quot; as the first product. In 1994, the 87-year-old Zino Davidoff died in Geneva, Switzerland.

<text>Shaolin Soccer (Chinese: ) is a 2001 Hong Kong sports comedy film directed by Stephen Chow, who also stars in the lead role. The film revolves around a former Shaolin monk who reunites his five brothers, years after their master&#x27;s death, to apply their superhuman martial arts skills to play soccer and bring Shaolin kung fu to the masses. 

==Plot==
&quot;Golden Leg&quot; Fung, a Hong Kong soccer star, beats and berates his teammate Hung when the latter offers him a cheque to lose the game, claiming to be the middleman. But Fung takes the cheque in the end and loses the game. Angry spectators beat him and break his leg.

Twenty years later, Fung walks with a limp and is the mistreated lackey of Hung, now a successful businessman. When Fung asks to coach Hung&#x27;s soccer team, Hung mocks him and reveals he tricked him with a bad cheque and hired those who broke his leg. While drinking his sorrows in the streets, Fung comes across Sing, a Shaolin kung fu master who wants to promote the practical benefits of the martial art to the world. No one takes kung fu classes from Sing, however, as he is dirty and poor. He steals mantou (steamed buns) from Mui, a woman with severe acne, who uses Tai chi to cook the food.

At first disdainful, Fung soon discovers the power of Sing&#x27;s leg and offers to coach him in soccer. Compelled by the idea of promoting kung fu through soccer, Sing asks his former Shaolin brothers to join his team. Sing&#x27;s brothers eventually agree. As a test, Fung arranges a game with a team known for their vicious cheating. The thug team gives the Shaolin team a beating. When all seems lost, the Shaolin team members reawaken their powers and utilize them to defeat the other team. The thugs ask to join Sing&#x27;s team. Sing takes Mui to try on expensive dresses at a high-end department store after hours and offers to buy her one. She gets a makeover to impress him, though the team and her boss mock her exaggerated &#x27;80s look. When Mui hints at her feelings for Sing, he tells her he only wants to be friends. She disappears after her boss fires her.

&quot;Team Shaolin&quot; enters the open cup competition in Hong Kong, where they see ridiculously one-sided victories due to their powers. They only meet their match in the final against Hung&#x27;s Team Evil, who have superhuman strength and speed due to an American drug. The referee has also been bought out by Hung. Team Evil badly injures two of Team Shaolin&#x27;s goalkeepers; the powerless members of Team Shaolin then flee. As the team is about to lose by default, Mui, who has shaved her head, reappears as their goalkeeper. When Team Evil&#x27;s striker kicks the ball with flaming force towards Mui, she stops it with tai chi. She and Sing combine their skills and rocket the ball downfield. The ball blows through Team Evil&#x27;s goal while hurling along all its players, scoring the sole and winning goal.

Later, Hung is imprisoned for doping, while the Team Evil players receive lifetime bans. Sing goes out for a jog and is pleased to see people around him using kung fu in their everyday lives, his lifelong dream having become a reality. A large ad on the side of a building shows that Sing and Mui, a famous couple, have won the world championship in bowling, among other things.

==Cast==
* Stephen Chow as Sing / Mighty Steel Leg (#10):&lt;br&gt;A Shaolin kung fu practitioner and former monk who wants to promote the martial arts form to the world. He is the team&#x27;s striker and uses his extremely powerful legs to produce unstoppable soccer shots.
* Ng Man-tat as Fung / Golden Leg:&lt;br&gt;A homeless man and former soccer player from the 1980s who became crippled after being beaten by an angry mob after a match, which he deliberately lost after taking a bribe from Hung, the coach of Team Evil.
* Wong Yat-fei as Iron Head (#11):&lt;br&gt;The eldest of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now working in a club. His style of kung fu utilizes his immensely hard head, and he specializes in headers during matches.
* Mok Mei-lam as Hooking Leg (#2):&lt;br&gt;The second eldest of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now working as a dishwasher. As the team&#x27;s full-back, Hooking Leg&#x27;s Shaolin skills resemble ground tumbling boxing, which he uses to keep the ball away from the opponent and confuse them.
* Tin Kai-man as Iron Shirt (#3):&lt;br&gt;The third of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now working as a businessman. As the team&#x27;s full-back, Iron Shirt can absorb blunt force attacks without injuries, as well as hold and propel the ball with his abdomen.
* Danny Chan Kwok-kwan as Empty Hand / Lightning Hand (#1):&lt;br&gt;The fourth of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now unemployed and job-hunting. Empty Hand resembles Bruce Lee to the point of wearing his yellow and black jumpsuit from &quot;Game of Death&quot;. As the team&#x27;s goalkeeper, his fast hands and powerful arms allow him to instantly and accurately catch objects thrown at him.
* Lam Chi-chung as Light Weight Vest (#6):&lt;br&gt;The sixth and youngest of the Shaolin monk brothers, who has become obese and gluttonous after being diagnosed with a pituitary disease. He is the team&#x27;s winger. Despite his illness, he is capable of utilizing his style of kung fu to leap incredible heights, giving the illusion of flight.
* Zhao Wei as Mui:&lt;br&gt;A baker and Sing&#x27;s love interest, who is skilled at manipulating objects with tai chi. She rarely speaks Cantonese, but everyone else still understands her and vice versa.
* Patrick Tse as Hung:&lt;br&gt;The coach of Team Evil and Fung&#x27;s former teammate, who has maintained a rivalry with Fung after forcing him to take a bribe during a match in the 1980s.
* Shik Zi-yun as Team Evil&#x27;s striker (#9), who can back flip and soar into the sky to kick a fiery ball to its target.
* Cao Hua as Team Evil&#x27;s goalkeeper (#21), who can guard his goalpost with one hand in his pocket. His incredibly strong hands can crush a thick metal crossbar.
* Cecilia Cheung and Karen Mok as Team Dragon players #7 &amp; #11, who can run so fast that they appear to be inches above the ground. 
* Fung Min-hun as the captain of Team Rebellion, a vicious mobster who wields a crescent wrench and steel mallet as weapons. 
* Vincent Kok as the captain of Team Tofu, the team that Team Shaolin faces in the preliminary match.

==Production==

===Inspiration===
The inspiration for &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; came from Chow wanting a unique premise for a martial arts action film. According to an interview with &quot;Premiere Magazine&quot;, Chow stated,
Chow had intended for this film to appeal to a global audience, stating, &quot;I can&#x27;t rely on the local market, because it&#x27;s too small, so since &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; it&#x27;s always my ambition to go international&quot;.

===Casting===
Apart from several veteran actors, Chow stated in an interview with &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine that he cast several people in his entourage who had no prior acting experience before &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;. For example, Lam Chi Chung (Light Weight) had worked as Chow&#x27;s screenwriter and Danny Chan Kwok-kwan (Empty Hand) was the dance choreographer hired to design the &quot;Michael Jackson dance number&quot; that followed Sing and Mui&#x27;s first meeting early in the film. Chow comments he made Chan wear Bruce Lee&#x27;s yellow-and-black tracksuit because only the goalkeeper &quot;can wear a special uniform.&quot; Tin Kai-man (Iron Shirt) had been Chow&#x27;s production manager on several movies, but had acted in numerous minor roles in previous films. For instance, he played a young wanna-be Triad member in Chow&#x27;s preceding movie, &quot;King of Comedy&quot;. Cecilia Cheung and Karen Mok, who briefly appear as Team Dragon Players 7 &amp; 11 in &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;, had major roles in King of Comedy. Chow defends his decision to hire non-actors, saying, &quot;In terms of finding talent, I try to bring out the funniest thing I notice about them during casting, if it made us laugh at the casting, it will also do on the big screen.&quot;

Zhao Wei, who played the Mandarin-speaking Mui, said it was a different step for her to star in a Hong Kong production. However, Zhao admitted that she was not impressed with her look with less makeup because she is easily recognisable for her beautiful appearance.

Three of the principal cast members appeared in Chow&#x27;s &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;: Danny Chan Kwok-kwan (Empty Hand) portrayed &quot;Brother Sum&quot;, boss of the &quot;Axe Gang&quot;; Tin Kai-man (Iron Shirt) portrayed the loud-mouthed &quot;advisor&quot; of Brother Sum; and Lam Chi-chung (Light Weight) portrayed &quot;Bone&quot;, Chow&#x27;s sidekick and partner in petty crime. Fung Min-hun (Team Rebellion Captain) briefly appeared as Cecilia Cheung&#x27;s abusive boyfriend in &quot;King of Comedy&quot; and the &quot;Four Eyes Clerk&quot; who beats up both Sing and Bone when they make fun of him on the bus in &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;.

==Home media==
In Hong Kong, the film was released on DVD and Video CD on 14 September 2001. The DVD release was shortened by 10 minutes, with the option for viewers to access the deleted scenes in the middle of the film. The scenes deleted from the DVD version are the dance sequence in front of Mui&#x27;s bakery, much of the conversation over Mui&#x27;s makeover and the blooper reel before the end credits. Viewers can also access the making of key special effects scenes as well.

The film was also released in UMD format for the Sony PSP on 23 December 2005.

The 2004 US DVD release by Miramax Films deleted 23 minutes of footage from the original cut; the omitted footage includes &quot;Golden Leg&quot; Fung&#x27;s flashback opening sequence and Sing&#x27;s interactions with Mui. This version features an English dub with Chow dubbing his own voice and Bai Ling as the voice of Mui. In addition, the DVD gives viewers the option to play the original Hong Kong version.

In the UK, the film was released on Blu-ray by Optimum Releasing on 26 January 2010.

The Japanese version of the film was released by Pioneer LDC on 22 November 2002. It was reissued by The Clockworks Group on 21 December 2003.

The Italian dub of the film features the voices of professional footballers Damiano Tommasi (as Mighty Steel Leg Sing), Vincent Candela (as Empty Hand), Marco Delvecchio (as Iron Head), Siniša Mihajlović (as Hooking Leg), Giuseppe Pancaro (as Iron Shirt) and Angelo Peruzzi (as Light Weight Vest).

==Reception==

===Box office===
At the Hong Kong box office, &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; grossed HK$60,739,847, making it the highest-grossing film in the region&#x27;s history at the time. It held the record until 2004 when it was topped by Stephen Chow&#x27;s next feature &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;. &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; earned a worldwide gross of US$42,776,760.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 89% approval rating based on 95 reviews; the average rating is 7.10/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The plot is utterly ridiculous, and the soccer in the movie is unlike any ever played anywhere on Earth, but watching &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;, you will probably find it impossible to care.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===China ban===

Chow disagreed with the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s National Radio and Television Administration, which was concerned that the film&#x27;s title would insult Buddhists. He refused to change the title to &quot;Kungfu Soccer&quot;, and the film&#x27;s producer was banned from shooting in mainland China for one year.

== Accolades ==
==Media adaptations==

===Comic books===
====Chinese====
The first of a four volume &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; manhua was published in Hong Kong roughly nine months after the film originally premiered in 2001. The characters were drawn with large manga-like eyes and cartoonish bodies, but the artists were careful to retain the likenesses of each actor who portrayed them.

====American====
ComicsOne approached noted comic book artist Andy Seto with the idea of creating a two volume manhua-style graphic novel adaptation of the feature film. Seto attached himself to the project because the film was very popular and, therefore, had &quot;a certain level of marketing value&quot;. The project was officially announced on 30 June 2003 and the release of vol. 1 was scheduled to coincide with the film&#x27;s US premiere in August, but the film was pushed back. The Miramax film corporation bought the American film rights to &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; before its release in China, so they helped publish the comic book along with two Chinese film companies who originally produced the film. Volumes 1 () and 2 () were released in August and November 2003 and sold for US$13.95 each. Their suggested reading level was age 13 and above.

Seto worked to make the novel as faithful to the film as possible but he admits that Stephen Chow&#x27;s brand of Mo lei tau comedy does not translate well into illustrations. He stated in an interview that &quot;the &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; comic is 80% movie adaptation with 20% new content.&quot; This new content includes a backstory about Steel Leg&#x27;s training in Shaolin before the death of his master, as well as completely rewriting entire sections of the movie. For example, in the film a group of bar thugs beat up Sing and Iron Head after listening to their lounge-style tribute to Shaolin kung fu. The following day, Sing seeks out the group and uses his Shaolin skills to beat the thugs using a soccer ball. Fung sees the brawl and comes up with the idea of fusing kung fu and soccer. However, in the comic book, Sing is meditating in the park when he gets hit in the head with a soccer ball. The cocky players mock him and destroy a stone statue of his deceased master. Sing proceeds to use the soccer ball as a weapon.

Another example is the fact the characters are visually different from the film. All of their comic book personas look to be in their twenties to thirties, with highly toned athletic physiques (with the exception of Light Weight); even Iron Head, who was the eldest of the six brothers, appears younger than he should.

Several online reviews have criticised the American adaptation for its apparent lack of story line coherence, mixture of realistic and cartoonish drawing styles, and bad Chinese-to-English translation, among other issues. In regards to the translation, one reviewer stated, &quot;It&#x27;s almost as if the book was translated with a first-year English student referencing a Chinese-to-English dictionary, with strangely assembled sentences and strange bursts of dialogue peppering the pages.&quot; Another common complaint was that the comics seemed to be geared towards those people who had previously seen the movie. Without this familiarity, a newcomer would lose track of the storyline because of the overcrowded pages and rapidly shifting plot.

==Legacy==

* One episode of &quot;Keroro Gunso&quot; had a soccer theme which parodied this movie.
* The music video for the American R&amp;B singer-songwriter and rapper Lumidee&#x27;s song &quot;Dance&quot; launched and the 2006 FIFA World Cup album soundtrack has scenes of the movie.
* A clip of &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; was played on the big screen of the venue before the match Ivory Coast vs Serbia and Montenegro in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
* In June 2023, Stephen Chow took to social media to announce the completion of the script for his latest cinematic venture, titled &quot;Shaolin Women&#x27;s Soccer&quot;.

<text>The Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A. E. W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title. In December 1901, &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; announced the title as one of two new serial stories to be published in the forthcoming year. Against the background of the Mahdist War, young Feversham disgraces himself by quitting the army, which others perceive as cowardice, symbolized by the four white feathers they give him. He redeems himself with acts of great courage and wins back the heart of the woman he loves.

==Plot summary==
British officer Harry Feversham resigns from his commission in the Royal North Surrey Regiment just before Lord Wolseley&#x27;s 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Colonel Ahmed Orabi. He is censured for cowardice by three of his comradesCaptain Trench and Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughbysignified by their delivery of three white feathers to him. His Ulster fiancée, Ethne Eustace, breaks off their engagement and also gives him a white feather. His best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance, becomes a rival for Ethne.

Harry talks with Lieutenant Sutch, a friend of his late father who is an imposing retired general. He questions his own motives, but says he will redeem himself by acts that will convince his critics to take back the feathers. He travels on his own to Egypt and Sudan, where in 1882 Muhammad Ahmed proclaimed himself the Mahdi (Guided One) and raised a holy war. On 26 January 1885, his Dervish forces captured Khartoum and killed its British governor, General Charles George Gordon. Most of the action over the next six years takes place in the eastern Sudan, where the British and Egyptians held Suakin. Durrance is blinded by sunstroke and invalided. Castleton is killed at Tamai, where a British square is briefly broken by a Mahdi attack.

Harry&#x27;s first success comes when he recovers lost letters of Gordon. He is aided by a Sudanese Arab, Abou Fatma. Later, disguised as a mad Greek musician, Harry gets imprisoned in Omdurman, where he rescues Captain Trench, who had been captured on a reconnaissance mission. They escape.

Learning of his actions, Willoughby and Trench give Ethne the feathers they had taken back from Harry. He returns to England and then travels on to Ramelton, a small town in the north of County Donegal in Ulster in the north of Ireland, where he sees Ethne for what he thinks is one last time, as she has decided to devote herself to the blind Durrance. But Durrance knows that Ethne loves Harry and frees her for Harry. Ethne and Harry wed, and Durrance travels to &quot;the East&quot; as a civilian.

==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==
This novel&#x27;s story was adapted in several films with all films retaining much of the storyline.

In the 1929 silent version, a square of Highlanders is broken, but saved by Feversham and the Egyptian garrison of a besieged fort. Set in the 1880s, its great moment comes as wild hippos in a river attack the Dervishes pursuing Feversham.

The films each feature a British square broken in a dramatic battle sequence. This is mentioned in the novel in a battle in which the square recovered. The various film versions differ in historical context.

The 2002 version starring Heath Ledger is set during the 1884–85 campaign. The British infantry square was broken in the battle of Abu Klea, and the British are forced to retreat. Critics complained the film did not explore the characters, and had historical inaccuracies in uniform dress. The central battle is accurately portrayed in the film &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966). The Muslims called Dervishes or The Mahdi are the same, as are the geographic settings of Britain, Egypt and the Sudan.

The various film versions are as follows:

<text>The mirror stage () is a concept in the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan. The mirror stage is based on the belief that infants recognize themselves in a mirror (literal) or other symbolic contraption which induces apperception (the turning of oneself into an object that can be viewed by the child from outside themselves) from the age of about six months.

Initially, Lacan proposed that the mirror stage was part of an infant&#x27;s development from 6 to 18 months, as outlined at the Fourteenth International Psychoanalytical Congress at Marienbad in 1936. By the early 1950s, Lacan&#x27;s concept of the mirror stage had evolved: he no longer considered the mirror stage as a moment in the life of the infant, but as representing a permanent structure of subjectivity, or as the paradigm of &quot;Imaginary order&quot;. This evolution in Lacan&#x27;s thinking becomes clear in his later essay titled &quot;The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire&quot;.

==History of development==
Lacan&#x27;s concept of the mirror stage was strongly inspired by earlier work by psychologist Henri Wallon, who speculated based on observations of animals and humans responding to their reflections in mirrors. Wallon noted that by the age of about six months, human infants and chimpanzees both &quot;seem&quot; to recognize their reflection in a mirror. While chimpanzees rapidly lose interest in the discovery, human infants typically become very interested and devote much time and effort to exploring the connections between their bodies and their images. In a 1931 paper, Wallon argued that mirrors helped children develop a sense of self-identity. However, later mirror test research indicates that while toddlers are usually fascinated by mirrors, they do not actually recognize themselves in mirrors until the age of 15 months at the earliest, leading psychoanalytically trained critic Norman N. Holland to declare that &quot;there is no evidence whatsoever for Lacan&#x27;s notion of a mirror stage&quot;. Similarly, physician Raymond Tallis notes that a literal interpretation of the Lacanian mirror stage contradicts empirical observations about human identity and personality: &quot;If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the [mirror stage] theory would predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be unable to enter language, society or the world at large. There is no evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is borne out in practice.&quot;

Wallon&#x27;s ideas about mirrors in infant development were distinctly non-Freudian and little-known until revived in modified form a few years later by Lacan. As Evans writes, &quot;Lacan used this observation as a springboard to develop an account of the development of human subjectivity that was inherently, though often implicitly, comparative in nature.&quot; Lacan attempted to link Wallon&#x27;s ideas to Freudian psychoanalysis, but was met with indifference from the larger community of Freudian psychoanalysts. Richard Webster explains how the &quot;complex, and at times impenetrable paper ... appears to have made little or no lasting impression on the psychoanalysts who first heard it. It was not mentioned in Ernest Jones&#x27;s brief account of the congress and received no public discussion.&quot;

In the 1930s, Lacan attended seminars by Alexandre Kojève, whose philosophy was heavily influenced by Hegel. The diachronic structure of the mirror stage theory is influenced by Kojève&#x27;s interpretation of the master–slave dialectic. Lacan continued to refine and modify the mirror stage concept through the remainder of his career; see below.

Dylan Evans argues that Lacan&#x27;s earliest versions of the mirror stage, while flawed, can be regarded as a bold pioneering in the field of ethology (the study of animal behavior) and a precursor of both cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology. In the 1930s, zoologists were increasingly interested in the then-new field of ethology, but not until the 1960s would the larger scientific community believe that animal behavior offered any insights into human behavior.

However, Evans also notes that by the 1950s Lacan&#x27;s mirror stage concept had become abstracted to the point that it no longer required a literal mirror, but could simply be the child&#x27;s observation of observed behavior in the imitative gestures of another child or elder.

==Self-alienation==

The child&#x27;s initiation into what Jacques Lacan would call the &quot;mirror stage&quot; entails a &quot;libidinal dynamism&quot; caused by the young child&#x27;s identification with its own image and creation of what Lacan terms the &quot;Ideal-I&quot; or &quot;Ideal ego&quot;. This reflexivity inherent in fantasy is apparent in the mirror stage, since to recognize oneself as &quot;I&quot; is like recognizing oneself as other (&quot;yes, that person over there is me&quot;); this act is thus fundamentally self-alienating. Indeed, for this reason feelings towards the image are mixed, caught between hatred (&quot;I hate that version of myself because it is so much better than me&quot;) and love (&quot;I want to be like that image&quot;). A type of repetition compulsion develops from this vacillation as the attempt to locate a fixed subject proves ever elusive. &quot;The mirror stage is a drama...which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality.&quot; This misrecognition (seeing an ideal-I where there is a fragmented, chaotic body) subsequently &quot;characterizes the ego in all its structures.&quot;

==As phenomenon==
As Lacan further develops the mirror stage concept, the stress falls less on its historical value and ever more on its structural value. &quot;Historical value&quot; refers to the mental development of the child and &quot;structural value&quot; to the libidinal relationship with the body image. In Lacan&#x27;s fourth Seminar, &quot;La relation d&#x27;objet&quot;, he states that &quot;the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship&quot;. The dual relationship (&quot;relation duelle&quot;) refers not only to the relation between the Ego and the body, which is always characterized by illusions of similarity and reciprocity, but also to the relation between the Imaginary and the Real. The visual identity given from the mirror supplies imaginary &quot;wholeness&quot; to the experience of a fragmentary real. See Lacan&#x27;s paper, &quot;The Mirror Stage as formative of the function of the &quot;I&quot; as revealed in psychoanalytic experience&quot;, the first of his &quot;Écrits.&quot;

The mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of identification, the Ego being the result of identifying with one&#x27;s own specular image. At six months the baby still lacks coordination (see Louis Bolk); however, Lacan hypothesized that the baby can recognize itself in the mirror before attaining control over its bodily movements. The child sees its image as a whole, but this contrasts with the lack of coordination of the body and leads the child to perceive a fragmented body. This contrast, Lacan hypothesized, is first felt by the infant as a rivalry with its own image, because the wholeness of the image threatens it with fragmentation; thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the subject identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart is what forms the Ego. (Evans, 1996) The moment of identification is to Lacan a moment of jubilation since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery. (&quot;Écrits&quot;, &quot;The Mirror Stage&quot;) Yet, the jubilation may also be accompanied by a depressive reaction, when the infant compares his own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother. (&quot;La relation d&#x27;objet&quot;) This identification also involves the ideal ego which functions as a promise of future wholeness sustaining the Ego in anticipation.

The mirror stage, Lacan also hypothesized, shows that the Ego is the product of misunderstanding – Lacan&#x27;s term &quot;méconnaissance&quot; implies a false recognition. Additionally, the mirror stage is where the subject becomes alienated from itself, and thus is introduced into the Imaginary order.

The Mirror Stage has also a significant symbolic dimension. The Symbolic order is present in the figure of the adult who is carrying the infant: the moment after the subject has jubilantly assumed his image as his own, he turns his head toward this adult who represents the big Other, as if to call on him to ratify this image. (Tenth Seminar, &quot;L&#x27;angoisse&quot;, 1962–1963)

<text>Applied philosophy (philosophy from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, &#x27;love of wisdom&#x27;) is a branch of philosophy that studies philosophical problems of practical concern. The topic covers a broad spectrum of issues in environment, medicine, science, engineering, policy, law, politics, economics and education. The term was popularised in 1982 by the founding of the Society for Applied Philosophy by Brenda Almond, and its subsequent journal publication &quot;Journal of Applied Philosophy&quot; edited by Elizabeth Brake. Methods of applied philosophy are similar to other philosophical methods including questioning, dialectic, critical discussion, rational argument, systematic presentation, thought experiments and logical argumentation.

Applied philosophy is differentiated from pure philosophy primarily by dealing with specific topics of practical concern, whereas pure philosophy does not take an object; metaphorically it is philosophy applied to itself; exploring standard philosophical problems and philosophical objects (e.g. metaphysical properties) such as the fundamental nature of reality, epistemology and morality among others. Applied philosophy is therefore a subsection of philosophy, broadly construed it does not deal with topics in the purely abstract realm, but takes a specific object of practical concern.

== Definitions ==

=== General definition ===
Due to the recent coinage of the term, the full scope and meaning of Applied Philosophy is at times still quite ambiguous and contentious, but generally does interact with the several other general definitions of philosophy. &quot;A Companion of Applied Philosophy&quot; provides three introductory articles by Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, David Archard and Suzanne Uniacke that outline general definitions and parameters for the field of Applied Philosophy.

In the first chapter, Lippert-Rasmussen article “The Nature of Applied Philosophy” begins by unpacking the term “applied philosophy”, outlining that to apply is a verb that takes an object, therefore if one were doing philosophy and not applying it to something then one would be grammatically or conceptually confused to say that one is doing applied philosophy. Lippert-Rasmussen provides seven conceptions of Applied Philosophy: the relevance conception, the specificity conception, the practical conception, the activist conception, the methodological conception, the empirical facts conception, the audience conception. These definitions are specified in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, making the different conceptions incompatible with one another. Lippert-Rasmussen stresses that applied philosophy is much larger than that of applied ethics, therefore applied philosophers should strive beyond just proposing normative moral frameworks, allowing for Applied Philosophy to offer metaphysical frameworks for understanding contemporary results in other sciences and disciplines.

In the third chapter of &quot;A Companion of Applied Philosophy&quot;, Suzanne Uniacke&#x27;s article “The Value of Applied Philosophy”, Uniacke outlines that applied philosophy is really a field of philosophical inquiry, differentiating itself from pure philosophy by claiming the former can provide practical guidance on issues beyond the philosophical domain. Within applied philosophy there are generally two modes of focus, it can be academically focused (for an academic audience), or it can be in “out-reach mode” (for a non-academic audience). In drawing on philosophical subdisciplines such as metaphysics, epistemology and ethics, applied philosophers shape their contributions and analysis on issues of practical concern. In this intersection between philosophical theories, principles, and concepts with issues beyond that of the purely philosophical domain (out-reach mode), these problems may give valuable challenges to traditionally accepted philosophies, providing a stress test, feedback or friction on principles that are so often confined within the idealistic philosophical framework.

=== Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen: seven conceptions ===
Relevance conception: Claims that philosophy is applied if and only if it is relevant to important questions of everyday life. To be clear this conception claims that applied philosophy need not answer the important questions of everyday life, yet it needs to philosophically explore or at least be relevant to them. There is no requirement on what type of everyday life questions are relevant, it can vary across time and audience, some questions may be relevant to some people at one time and to others at another.

Specificity conception: Philosophy is applied if, and only if, it addresses a comparatively specific question within the branch of philosophy, e.g., metaphysics, epistemology or moral philosophy, to which it belongs. Establishes philosophical principles to then apply and explore their implications in the applied (non-philosophical) specific domains of inquiry.

Practical conception: Philosophy is applied if, and only if, it justifies an answer to comparatively specific questions within its relevant branch of philosophy about what we ought to do.

Activist conception: Philosophy is applied if, and only if, it is motivated by an ambition of having a certain causal effect on the world. Whether that causal effect be to educate, elucidate or edify on a given topic, with real world consequences thereof. As Lippert-Rasmussen points out, much of pure philosophy has quite an impact on the world and yet one would still claim it to be pure rather than applied philosophy, however the distinction of the activist conception lies in their goal, the activist conception has greater emphasis on being an educator and having a causal impact on the world, changing their primary philosophical commitment from “knowledge and truth” to having a causal impact. The change of commitment and goals may result in the change of methods in order to realize their goal.

Methodological conception: Philosophy is applied if, and only if, it involves the use of specifically philosophical methods to explore issues outside the narrow set of philosophical problems.

Empirical facts conception: Philosophy is applied if, and only if, it is significantly informed by empirical evidence – in particular, that provided by empirical sciences. Stresses the interdisciplinary nature of applied philosophy, characterising applied philosophy as drawing on the results of empirical sciences and the evidence thereof to be sufficiently informed in contributing philosophical analysis and input.

Audience conception: Philosophy is applied if, and only if, its intended audience is non-philosophers. Despite the audience conception not always requiring background knowledge of the given audience, it is prudent for philosophers who are engaging with specific scientific disciplines to be well read on the empirical facts of those disciplines the philosopher addresses, thus re-iterating the value of being empirically informed with the facts, especially when engaging with interdisciplinary studies of philosophy with some other subject.

== Applied moral philosophy ==
Applied moral philosophy (or applied ethics) is the branch of moral philosophy concerned with philosophical inquiry into moral issues that arise in everyday contexts and institutional design frameworks (e.g. how social institutions are structured). Applied moral philosophy involves the use of philosophical theories and methods of analysis to treat fundamentally moral problems in non-philosophical subjects, such as technology, public policy, and medicine. This includes the use of fundamental moral principles and theories to assess particular social practices, arrangements, and norms prevailing in particular societies at particular times. Some key topics in applied moral philosophy are business ethics, bioethics, feminist ethics, environmental ethics, and medical ethics. Beauchamp (1984) notes where applied moral philosophy and theoretical ethics diverge is not in their methodologies, but rather, in the content of their analysis and assessment.

Although interest in topics of applied ethics, such as civil disobedience, suicide, and free speech, can be traced all the way back to antiquity, applied moral philosophy gained mainstream popularity recently. However, the history of philosophy still shows a tradition of moral philosophy more concerned with its theoretical concerns, such as justifying fundamental moral principles and examining the nature of moral judgements. Applied ethics first gained mainstream popularity in 1967, as many professions such as law, medicine and engineering were profoundly affected by social issues and injustices at the time. For example, various environmental movements sparked political conversations about humanities relationship to the natural world, which led to the development of important philosophical arguments against anthropocentrism. As awareness of these social concerns grew, so did discussions of them in academic philosophy. By the 1970s and 1980s, there was a surge in publications devoted to philosophical inquiry of subjects in applied ethics, which were initially directed at biomedical ethics, and later business ethics.

=== Sub-disciplines of moral philosophy ===
Moral philosophy is the branch of philosophy concerned with examining the nature of right and wrong. It seeks to provide a framework for what constitutes morally right and wrong actions, and analyses issues surrounding moral principles, concepts and dilemmas. There are three main sub-disciplines of moral philosophy: meta-ethics, normative ethics and applied ethics.

Meta-ethics is the branch of moral philosophy which analyses the nature and status of ethical terms and concepts. It deals with abstract questions about the nature of morality, including whether or not morality actually exists, whether moral judgements are truth-apt (capable of being binary true/false), and if they are, investigating whether the properties of moral statements make them truth-apt in the same way that mathematical and descriptive statements are.

Normative ethics deals with the construction and justification of fundamental moral principles that ought to guide human behaviour. There are three main branches of normative ethical theories: consequentialism, deontology and virtue-based ethics. Consequentialism argues that an action is morally permissible if and only if it maximizes some intrinsic overall good. Deontological theories place rights and duties as the fundamental determinates of what we ought to do, by determining what rights and duties are justifiable constraints on behaviour. Finally, virtue-based theories argue that what one ought to do is what the ideally virtuous person would do.

Applied ethics uses philosophical methods of inquiry to address the moral permissibility of specific actions and practices in particular circumstances. However, applied ethics still requires theories and concepts found in meta-ethics and normative ethics to adequately address applied ethical problems. For example, one cannot confidently assert the moral permissibility of abortion without also assuming that there is such a thing as morally permissible actions, which is a fundamental meta-ethical question. Similarly, the moral permissibility of an action can be justified using a fundamental moral theory or principle found in normative ethics. A conception of these disciplines as such allows for significant overlap in the questions they address, along with their moral theories and ideas.

=== Methodologies ===
Applied ethics uses philosophical theories and concepts to tackle moral issues found in non-philosophical contexts. However, there is significant debate over the particular methodology that should be used when determining the moral permissibility of actions and practices during applied ethical inquiry.

One possible methodology involves the application of moral principles and theories to particular issues in applied ethics, and is known as the top-down model of philosophical analysis. Under this model, one must first determine the set of fundamental moral principles which should hold necessarily and universally, in order to apply them to particular issues in applied ethics. The next step is articulating the relevant empirical facts of a situation to better understand how these principles should be applied in that particular context, which then determines the moral permissibility of an action. There are significant issues with this model of how to resolve issues in applied moral philosophy, as it requires certainty in a definitive set of moral principles to guide human behaviour. However, there is universal disagreement over which principles this definitive set consists of, if any, creating issues for a conception of applied ethics using the top-down model. On the other hand, the bottom-up model involves formulating intuitive responses to questions about what one ought to do in particular situations, and then developing philosophical understandings or judgements based on the intuitions one has about a case. We can then revise intuitions in light of these philosophical judgements to reach an appropriate resolution on what one ought to do in a given situation. This model faces similar problems as the previous one, where disagreements about particular judgements and intuitions require us to have some other mechanism to examine the validity of intuitive judgements.

The Reflective Equilibrium model combines the top-down and bottom-up approaches, where one should reflect on their current beliefs, and revise them in light of their general and particular moral judgements. A general belief may be rejected in light of specific situations to which it is applied when the belief recommends an action one finds morally unacceptable. A particular belief can likewise be rejected if it conflicts with general moral beliefs one takes to be plausible, and which justifies many of their other moral beliefs about what one ought to do in a given situation. An agent can then reach a state of equilibrium where the set containing their general and particular moral judgements is coherent and consistent.

=== Business ethics ===
Business ethics is the study of moral issues that arise when human beings exchange goods and services, where such exchanges are fundamental to daily existence. A major contemporary issue in business ethics is about the social responsibility of corporate executives. One theory proposed by Friedman (2008) describes the sole responsibility of a CEO (Chief Executive Officer) being profit maximization through their business abilities and knowledge. This is known at stockholder theory, which says promoting the interests of stockholders is the sole responsibility of corporate executives.

Freeman (1998) presents a competing theory of corporate social responsibility by appealing to pre-theoretical commitments about the moral significance of assessing who an action affects and how. Proponents of stakeholder theory argue that corporate executives have moral responsibilities to all stakeholders in their business operations, including consumers, employees, and communities. Thus, a business decision may maximize profits for stockholders, but it is not morally permissible unless it does not conflict with the demands of other stakeholders in the company. Freeman (2008) takes a Rawlsian approach to mediate conflicts amongst stakeholders, where the right action is that which will promote the well-being of the stakeholders who are the least well-off. Other decision-making principles can also be appealed to, and an adequate stakeholder theory will be assessed according to the decision making theory it employs to mediate between conflicting demands, the plausibility of the theory, and its ability to achieve results in particular cases.

Another key issue in business ethics, questions the moral status of corporations. If corporations are the kind of thing capable of being morally evaluated, then they can be assigned moral responsibility. Otherwise, there remains a question of whom to ascribe moral blame towards for morally wrong business practices. French (2009) argues that corporations are moral agents, and that their “corporate internal decision structure” can be morally evaluated, as it has the required intentionality for moral blameworthiness. Danley (1980) disagrees and says that corporations cannot be moral agents merely because they are intentional, but that other considerations, such as the ability to be punished, must obtain when assigning moral responsibility to an agent.

=== Bioethics ===
Bioethics is the study of human conduct towards the animate and inanimate natural world against a background of life sciences. It provides a disciplinary framework for a wide array of moral questions in life sciences that concern humans, the environment, and animals. There are 3 main sub-disciplines of bioethics: medical ethics, animal ethics, and environmental ethics.

=== Medical ethics ===
Medical ethics can be traced back to the Hippocratic Oath in 500 B.C.E., making it the oldest sub-discipline of bioethics. Medical ethics concerns itself with questions of what one ought to do  in particular moral situations arising in medical contexts. There are a number of key issues in medical ethics, such as end-of-life and beginning-of-life debates, physician-patient relationships, and adequate healthcare accessibility.

The abortion debate remains one of the most widely discussed issues in medical ethics, which concerns the conditions under which an abortion is morally permissible, if any. Thomson (1971) revolutionized philosophical understanding of issues in the abortion debate, by questioning the widespread belief that because a fetus is a person, that it is morally wrong to kill them. She uses the violinist thought experiment to show that even if a fetus is a person, their right to life is not absolute, and therefore provided non-theistic and rational justification for the moral permissibility of abortion under certain conditions. Frances Kamm (1992) takes a deontological approach in order to expand on Thomson&#x27;s argument, where she argues that factors such as third-party intervention and morally responsible creation support its permissibility.

Another debate in medical ethics is about the moral permissibility of euthanasia, and under what conditions euthanasia is morally acceptable. Euthanasia is the intentional killing of another person in order to benefit them. One influential argument in favour of voluntary active euthanasia and voluntary passive euthanasia is put forth by Rachels (1975), who is not only able to show the permissibility of the latter in cases where someone&#x27;s life is no longer worth living, but that there mere fact that active euthanasia involves killing someone and passive euthanasia involves letting them die does not make it more just to do one over the other. He presents his argument in response to critics who argue that it is morally worse to kill someone than to merely let them die. However, he considers a case where a husband wants his wife to die, and in one case, does so by putting lethal poison in her wine, and in the second case, walks in on her drowning in a bathtub and lets her die. He argues that his thought experiment shows why killing someone is not always morally worse than letting them die, forcing defenders of only passive euthanasia to also commit themselves to the moral permissibility of active euthanasia, unless they can show why only the former option is morally acceptable.

=== Environmental ethics ===
Environmental ethics is the discipline of applied ethics that studies the moral relationship of human beings to the environment and its non-human contents. The practical goals of environmental ethics are to provide a moral grounds for social policies aimed at protecting the environment and remedying its degradation. It questions the status of the environment independently of human beings, and categorizes the different positions on its status as anthropocentrism and non-anthropocentrism. Anthropocentrism is the view that value is human-centered and all other entities are means to human ends. This bears on the question of the value of the environment, and whether or not the environment has intrinsic value independent of human beings. By taking a non-anthropocentric view that it does have intrinsic value, one should question why humanity would try to destroy something with intrinsic value rather than preserve it, under the assumption that agents will try to preserve things with value.

Feminism has an important relationship to environmental ethics where, as King (1989) argues, human exploitation of nature can be seen as a manifestation and extension of the oppression of women. She argues that humanity&#x27;s destruction of nature is a result of associating nature with the feminine, where feminine agents have historically and systemically been inferiorized and oppressed by a male-dominating culture. King (1989) motivates her argument by examining the historical domination of women in society, and then argues that all other domination and hierarchies flow from this. Her argument justifies the moral wrongness of environmental degradation and human exploitation of nature not by arguing in favour of its intrinsic value, but by appealing to the moral wrongness of female oppression by a male-dominating culture.

== Applied political and legal philosophy ==
Applied political and legal philosophy conducts investigation and analysis using philosophical methods and theories into specific and concrete political and legal issues. Historically, much of the work in political and legal philosophy has pursued more general issues, such as questions about the nature of justice, ideal forms of democracy, and how to organize political and legal institutions. Applied political and legal philosophy uses the insights of political and legal philosophy to critically examine more concrete issues within the disciplines. Some examples include philosophical inquiry into family-based immigration policies, understanding the conceptual structure of civil disobedience, and discussing the bounds of prosecutorial discretion in domestic violence cases. Dempsey and Lister (2016) identify three activist approaches to applied political and legal philosophy.

=== Activist approaches ===
The &quot;standard activist approach&quot; is used when a philosopher presents arguments directed primarily at other philosophers, defending or critiquing a policy or some set of policies. If a policy maker happens to come across the argument, and is sufficiently persuaded to make public policy changes supporting the philosophers desired outcome, then the standard activist philosopher will be satisfied. However, their main goal is to articulate a sound argument in favour of their position on some policy or set of political/legal issues, regardless of if it actually influences public policy.

&quot;Conceptual activism&quot; is when arguments are directed primarily to other philosophers, and critically analyses and clarifies some concept, where the arguments presented may be relevant in future policy making. The goal of conceptual activists is to motivate a particular understanding of concepts which may later inform policy making. Westen&#x27;s (2017) work on consent is paradigmatic of this approach, where his analysis of the concept of consent unpacks confusions amongst not only philosophers and academics, but also policy makers, as to the nature and limitations of consent.

&quot;Extreme activism&quot; is when a philosopher acts as an expert consultant and presents an argument directly to policy makers in favour of some view. Although they still aim to present a sound argument about what should happen in the world, as the standard activist does, this goal is just as important as their goal to persuade policy makers in order to bring about the desired outcome of their work. Thus, the measure of success for an extreme activist consists not only of doing good philosophy, but also of their direct causal contribution to the world. However, the tension between their political and philosophical goals has potentially negative outcomes, such as wasting policy makers&#x27; time, who are not convinced by philosophical arguments, the possibility of corruption for philosophers placed in this position, and the potential to undermine the value of philosophy.

=== Feminist political philosophy ===
Feminist political philosophy involves understanding and critiquing political philosophy&#x27;s inattention to feminist concerns, and instead articulates ways for political theory to be reconstructed to further feminist aims. Feminist political philosophy has been instrumental in reorganising political institutions and practices, as well as developing new political ideals and practices which justify their reorganisation. Work in feminist political philosophy uses the various activist approaches to causally affect public policies and political institutions. For example, liberal feminist theorising, whose main concerns are protecting and enhancing women&#x27;s political rights and personal autonomy, has consistently used conceptual activism to further their aims.

== Applied epistemology ==

While epistemology—the study of knowledge and justified belief—used to primarily be concerned with the seeking of truth and have an individualistic orientation in the task of doing so, recent developments in this branch of philosophy do not only highlight the social ways in which knowledge is generated, but also its practical and normative dimensions. Applied epistemology is the branch of applied philosophy that precisely explores and addresses these considerations.

For instance, even if traditional epistemology often investigates what we are justified in believing—the most paradigmatic case being the tripartite analysis of knowledge, i.e. that &quot;S&quot; knows that &quot;p&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is true, &quot;S&quot; believes that &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; is justified in believing that &quot;p&quot;—, applied epistemologists have argued that those questions are equivalent to queries about what we ought to believe: stressing that epistemology is fundamentally a normative subject. Coady (2016) claims so by recognizing that this branch of philosophy is not merely interested in how things are, but also in how they ought to be. As a result, there might be different (and more preferable) methods for acquiring knowledge depending on whose values guide one&#x27;s orientation in life or what goals direct their pursuit of truth.

Social epistemology, in its focus on the social dimensions of knowledge and the ways that institutions mediate its acquisition, often overlaps with and can be seen as a part of applied epistemology. But one cannot equate those fields of research as social epistemology has been, so far, a lot more investigated through a consequentialist lens—i.e. it has been exploring the epistemic consequences of our social institutions that generate knowledge—than other normative predispositions. Coady (2016) claims that social epistemology has not sufficiently addressed questions of what individuals ought to believe and how they should pursue knowledge. And, while this social and consequentialist orientation has great value, applied epistemology also encompasses other normative orientations—like deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics, amongst others—and explores individualistic questions of practical epistemic concerns.

The potential topics of applied epistemology include, but are not limited to: feminist epistemology, the epistemology of deliberative democracy, freedom of expression and diversity, conspiracy theories, the epistemological dimensions and implications of sexual consent, information markets, and more.

=== Feminist epistemology ===
Feminist epistemology studies how gendered practices and norms contribute to social oppression—including, but not limited to the enforcement of heteropatriarchy, racism, ableism, and classism—and proposes ways for agents to revise them in light of this. This branch of feminist philosophy also contributes to the scope of social epistemology as it identifies several ways in which conventional knowledge practices and processes disadvantage women, such as excluding them from inquiry, denying them epistemic authority, and producing theories of women which misrepresent them to serve patriarchal interests.

Feminist epistemology is not only applied in the sense that its liberatory goals are explicitly political and, as a result, seek a certain causal effect on the world. But this branch of epistemology is also greatly relevant since, to be effective activists, Wylie (2001) stresses that it is necessary “to understand the conditions that disadvantage women with as much empirical accuracy and explanatory power as possible.”

A demonstration of this necessity is that, since the Black and lesbian feminist theorizing of the 1980s, it is not effective anymore for feminists to investigate the conceptions and phenomena related to gender without the concept of intersectionality: which does not only make visible how the lived experiences of an individual and social group are shaped by their interdependent and overlapping identities, but also that, ultimately, their access to power and privilege is structured by those. Crenshaw (1989) coined this interpretative framework by investigating the failures of the legal courts in &quot;DeGraffenreid v General Motors&quot; (1976), &quot;Moore v Hughes Helicopter&quot; (1983), and &quot;Payne v Travenol&quot; (1976) to recognize that Black women were both discriminated on the basis of gender and of race.

=== Epistemology of deliberative democracy ===
The deliberative conception of democracy claims that public deliberation is necessary for the justification of this political system and the legitimacy of its decision-making processes. Broadly put, public deliberations refer to the open spaces where free and equal citizens share and discuss their reasons for supporting different policy proposals and societal ideas. This emphasis on public deliberation differentiates the deliberative conception from the aggregative conception of democracy: which understands the democratic process as a tool to gather and track the preferences and beliefs of citizenry at the moment of voting. This area of applied epistemology explores the epistemic values, virtues, and vices that underscore and can be observed to emerge from deliberative decision-making.

For instance, in the case of a referendum or an election, the Condorcet jury theorem (CJT) articulates that: if each voter is more likely than not to be correct on a topic on which they are asked to vote (i.e. the competence condition) and if each votes independently from one another (i.e. the independence condition), then it is not only the case that a majority of people is more likely to be correct than a single individual on the outcome of their vote. But it is also the case that the probability that a majority will vote for the correct outcome increases with the number of voters.

On the one hand, the CJT provides a solid defense and empirical argument for the importance of voting in democracy: this procedure leads decision-making bodies to make better decisions because of more accurate epistemic inputs. On the other hand, it also creates a debate on the influence of public deliberations on the well-functioning of voting procedures. While Estlund (1989) and Waldron (1989) claim that public deliberation, in its exchange of reasons and information about the outcomes under discussion, improves the competence condition of the votes, Dietrich and Spiekermann (2013) raise concerns about the fact that: if voters engage with one another too much prior to or at the moment of making a decision, the independence condition of the CJT is undermined and its optimistic results become distorted.

Many have also raised the ‘public ignorance’ objection to the deliberative conception of democracy: holding that most people are too ignorant for deliberative democracy to be an effective and viable practice. Talisse (2004) responds to this proposed limitation by claiming that it is unclear about what exactly ‘ignorance’ refers to — according to him, this objection conflates the states of being uninformed, misinformed, and uninterested — and that attributing culpability to those that ‘do not know’ takes responsibility away from the democratic institutions (like media and academia) that fail them.

While social epistemology takes a closer look at the roles of institutional practices to generate, mediate, or prevent knowledge acquisition, a substantial debate in the epistemology of deliberative democracy concerns the legal sanctions on speech, behavior and freedom of expression. The contribution of J.S. Mill (1859) is frequently referenced on this issue, notably supporting that free speech and public deliberation help to eliminate wrong opinions, permit correct beliefs to prevail, and, as a result, promote truth. Censorship and strict limitations of the public sphere would prevent different parties, in a disagreement, from even perceiving the truthful elements of their opponent&#x27;s argument and could reinforce dogmatic tendencies in a given society. Landemore (2013) also supports that diversity is epistemically beneficial in deliberative democracies; there are higher chances to reach a correct truth if considering more diverse perspectives than few. Even if one can think of the dimensions of diversity that social and feminist epistemologies refer to, Kappel, Hallsson, and Møller (2016) also bring to the forefront of the discussion: diversity of knowledge, diversity of opinion, cognitive diversity, epistemic norm diversity, and non-epistemic value diversity.

If diversity may help to neutralize biases, ‘enclave deliberations’—a communicative process amongst like-minded people “who talk or even live, much of the time, in isolated enclaves”— can lead to group polarization. Sunstein (2002) defines group polarization as the phenomenon in which members of a group move towards a more extreme position during the process of deliberating with their peers than before doing so. For him, two reasons explain the statistical regularity of this phenomenon. On the one hand, he points to the fact that people do not usually discuss with groups that share different inclinations and predispositions on a particular topic: greatly limiting their ‘argument pool’. On the other hand, he acknowledges that group polarization also arises from the desire of group members to be perceived favourably by their peers.

Sunstein also points to the empirical evidence that diverse and heterogeneous groups tend to give less weight to the views of low-status members — the latter also being frequently more quiet in deliberative bodies. This area of deliberative inequalities overlaps with applied political philosophy and can be explored in the works of: Bohman (1996) and Young (2000), amongst others.

Applied philosophers also propose epistemic virtues and valuable practices to cope with these epistemic vices and deliberative dysfunction. Starting from the premise that there is nothing wrong with changing and being convinced by others about our views, Peter (2013) suggests that it is how one navigates disagreements that matters. For her, well-conducted deliberations are those in which participants treat each other as epistemic peers, that is, they recognize that they are as likely to make a mistake along the way as their peers. As a result, they should not be closed to revising their original beliefs (especially if they realize that their arguments are not sufficiently robust) while holding themselves mutually accountable to one another.

Other topics that explore the epistemology of deliberative democracy include, but are not limited to: epistemic proceduralism, the value or disvalue of disagreement, epistocracy, and social integration, among others.

== Applied Ontology ==

Applied ontology involves the application of ontology to practical pursuits. This can involve adopting ontological principles in the creation of controlled, representational vocabularies. These vocabularies, referred to as &#x27;ontologies&#x27;, can be compiled to organize scientific information in a computer-friendly format.

One of the primary uses of ontologies is improving interoperability of data systems. Data within and between organizations can sometimes be trapped within data silos. Ontologies can improve data integration by offering a representative structure which diverse data systems can link up to. By representing our knowledge about domains through classes and the relations between them, ontologies can also be used to improve information retrieval and discovery from databases. 

When an ontology is limited to representing entities from a specific subject or domain, it is called a domain ontology. An upper-level ontology (or top-level ontology) represents entities at a highly general level of abstraction. The classes and relations of an upper-level ontology are applicable to many different domain ontologies. Criteria to count as an upper level ontology are defined by ISO/IEC 21838-1:2021.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 21838&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of upper-level ontologies include Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), and TUpper. There are also mid-level ontologies, which define terms that are used in different domains and are less general than those in upper-level ontologies, which they extend from and conform to, such as the Common Core Ontologies.

<text>The Teatro Nacional de São Carlos () (&quot;National Theatre of Saint Charles&quot;) is an opera house in Lisbon, Portugal. It was opened on June 30, 1793 by Queen Maria I as a replacement for the Tejo Opera House, which was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The theatre is located in the historical center of Lisbon, in the Chiado district. 

The house has a seating capacity of 844 seats.

== History ==
In 1792, a group of Lisbon businessmen decided to finance the construction of a new Opera House in the city. The theatre was built in only six months following a design by Portuguese architect José da Costa e Silva, with neoclassical and rococo elements. The general project is clearly inspired by great Italian theatres like the San Carlo of Naples (interior) and La Scala in Milan (interior and façade). In the early 19th century, when the Portuguese Royal Court had to flee to the Portuguese colony of Brazil to escape the invading Napoleonic troops, a theatre modelled on the São Carlos was built in Rio de Janeiro.

The theatre was erected in honor of Princess Charlotte of Spain who had been married in 1785 at the age of 10 to the future King, Prince John and resided with him from 1790 once she was of childbearing age: Carlos (Portuguese form of Charles) is the masculine form of Charlotte. A Latin commemorative inscription dedicates the theatre to the princess.

The first opera presented here, in 1793, was &quot;La Ballerina Amante&quot;, by Domenico Cimarosa. The most famous Portuguese composer of the time, Marcos Portugal, became musical director of the São Carlos in 1800 after returning from Italy, and many of his operas were staged here.

Between 1828 and 1834, the São Carlos was closed during the Portuguese Civil War, fought between kings Miguel I and Pedro IV. In 1850, the lighting of the interior was changed to gas illumination, the latest technology available. Shortly afterwards, the Portuguese state bought the theatre from private investors. After a few failed attempts, electrical illumination was installed in 1887. From 1935 to 1940, the theatre was closed for repairs.

In 1974, a resident opera company was established. In 1993, the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa was created as the Teatro&#x27;s affiliate orchestra, with Álvaro Cassuto as the orchestra&#x27;s first principal conductor. Subsequent principal conductors of the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa have included José Ramón Encinar (1999–2001), Zoltán Peskó (2001–2004) and Julia Jones (2008–2011). Since January 2014, the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor is Joana Carneiro.

The theatre building was classified as Property of Public Interest in 1928 and has been reclassified as a National Monument since 1996.

== Architecture ==

Longitudinal and composite building with articulated parts has a sober facade. The frontispiece is divided into 3 parts: 2 floors on mezzanine and a third floor on the central body. This central body is torn by a portico (entrance hall), and has a loggia at the ground level composed of 3 frontal arches and a lateral, in perfect round. The loggia is crowned by a perfect terrace of balustrade in stonework. Here, the windows are framed by parastase, that supports a highlighted cornice. They also have a crown composed of panels with inscription and two high reliefs. At the level of the third floor, this same central body presents a clock surrounded by garlands and two windows, all of which is surmounted by two pinnacles and the Portuguese coats-of-arms.

At the level of the first floor, the two side bodies have two straight-polished doors crowned by low windows. Although with the same two windows, at the second floor level they feature balustrade in stonework, protruding cornice and a small window in the mezzanine area.

The main room (performance hall) is elliptic, has five tiers of boxes and seats 1148 people. The luxurious royal box was lavishly decorated by the Italian Giovanni Appianni. The ceiling was painted by Manuel da Costa and the stage by Cirilo Wolkmar Machado.

<text>University of Giessen, official name Justus Liebig University Giessen (), is a large public research university in Giessen, Hesse, Germany. It is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in the German-speaking world. It is named after its most famous faculty member, Justus von Liebig, the founder of modern agricultural chemistry and inventor of artificial fertiliser. It covers the areas of arts/humanities, business, dentistry, economics, law, medicine, science, social sciences and veterinary medicine. Its university hospital, which has two sites, Giessen and Marburg (the latter of which is the teaching hospital of the University of Marburg), is the only private university hospital in Germany.

==History==
The University of Giessen is among the oldest institutions of higher educations in the German-speaking world. It was founded in 1607 as a Lutheran university in the city of Giessen in Hesse-Darmstadt because the all-Hessian &quot;Landesuniversität&quot; (the nearby University of Marburg (&quot;Philipps-Universität Marburg&quot;) in Marburg, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel)) had become Reformed (that is, Calvinist). Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, whence the university got its original name &quot;Ludoviciana&quot;, founded his own institution of higher education in Giessen, which as a Lutheran institution had the primary function of ensuring the education of pastors and civil servants. Endowed with a charter issued by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, on 19 May 1607, the university was allowed to proceed with instruction in October 1607. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when Hesse-Darmstadt was able to take the area around Marburg for itself, the University of Giessen ceased instruction and was moved back to its more long-standing location in Marburg (1624/25). The Peace of Westphalia led to the restoration of the old location and in 1650 to the relocation of the university to Giessen.

In the 17th and 18th centuries the Ludoviciana was a typical small state university that then had the four common faculties (theology, law, medicine, and philosophy). The instruction was reasonable, with about 20 to 25 professors teaching several hundred students, the latter of which were mostly &quot;Landeskinder&quot;. In the 18th century came gradual modernization of the curricula and reforms in the instruction, which were definitively influenced by the local lordly court in Darmstadt. The example for the reforms were both of the &quot;model universities of the Enlightenment&quot;, the University of Halle, founded in 1694, and more still Georgia Augusta, founded in Göttingen in 1734/37. Indeed, all attempts at reform were from the start limited by the limited finances of Hesse-Darmstadt.

The noteworthy creation of a Faculty of Economics (1777–1785) was ultimately born out of this financial hardship. In the Faculty of Economics, new practical subjects were brought together (veterinary medicine, forestry, and cameral sciences), which the university was supposed to make &quot;expedient&quot; and &quot;profitable&quot;. (One of the earliest courses of study in forestry in Europe.) After finishing studies in this Faculty, a number of these youths were able to gain recognition in the Faculties of Medicine and Philosophy. They established the unusually diverse course offerings that continue to exist to the modern day at the University of Giessen.

The University of Giessen weathered the transition from the 18th to the 19th century unscathed and was still the only university of an enlarged territory, the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Alongside Jena, Giessen was the prototype for the politicized Vormärz university, and the &quot;Giessener Schwarzen&quot; with Karl Follen and Georg Büchner, marked the revolutionary spirit of this decade. With the appointment of the 21-year-old Justus von Liebig in 1824 through the Grand Duchy—against the will of the university on the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt—a new era in the natural sciences began, not only in Giessen. Young, promising scientists created a new impulse in their respective areas of knowledge; among these scientists were the antiquarian Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, the lawyer Rudolf von Jhering, the theologian Adolf von Harnack, the mathematician Moritz Pasch and the physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen.

At the turn of the 20th century, the Ludoviciana began to expand into a modern university. During this period, new clinics in human and veterinary medicine were established, and the university library received its first proper building. With the creation of the university&#x27;s central building (inaugurated 1880) and the adjacent newly constructed facilities for chemistry and physics a new cultural centre was established on what was then the border of the city. The decisive backer of this project was the last Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig, to whom the university bestowed out of thankfulness the honorary title of &quot;Rector Magnificentissimus&quot;. In 1902 the student body surpassed one thousand. For the first time included in the student body were women, who since 1900 were admitted as guest students and starting in 1908 were admitted for regular study.

After the different Hessian states were (re-)united in 1929, both universities became public universities of that German state. The University of Giessen now has almost 23,000 students and 8,500 employees, which together with the Giessen students of Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen, makes Giessen the most student-dominated German city.

In December 2019 the university shut down all of its IT-servers after a &quot;serious IT security incident&quot;. Hess State Prosecution Office investigated the case of a suspected hacker-attack.

===Growth in the student population===
Following is the growth in the student population of University of Giessen

In the 2014/2015 winter semester the student population exceeded the mark of more than a total of 28,000 students and 7,000 first-semester students for the first time. In the years 2019 to 2021 the student number was about 28,300, with a decrease to 27,400 students in the winter term 2021/2022 (probably due to COVID restrictions).

==Faculties and departments==

* Faculty 01 – Law
* Faculty 02 – Economics and Business Studies
* Faculty 03 – Social Sciences and Cultural Studies
* Faculty 04 – History and Cultural Studies

==Campus==

Although the university has no defined campus, buildings and facilities are grouped together according to their subject areas and situated in various locations around Giessen. Philosophikum II, for example is an area on the outskirts of the city bordering the city forest. A number of faculty buildings and lecture theaters are located there, including Audimax, a building containing several lecture halls whose atrium is often the venue for concerts and disco nights, locally known as &quot;Uni-Party&quot;.

== Student life ==

=== Myth ===
Two law students of University of Giessen, Karl Siegfrieden (4 June 1822 – 10 March 1840) and Karl von Müller (10 June 1799 – 10 March 1840), are buried in a double grave at Alter Friedhof cemetery in Giessen. That both died on the same day sparked the myth that they had fought against each other in a duel. However, in 2008 the local newspaper &quot;Gießener Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, referencing a 1939 chronicle of the fraternity Corps Teutonia zu Gießen which Karl von Müller co-founded, revealed that both students had died of typhus. Von Müller had contracted the disease while nursing his sick friend. The Corps buried both students after a torch-lit funeral procession.

== Rankings ==

According to the 2024 QS World University Rankings, the university was placed 396th globally and 22nd nationally. In the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for 2023, it fell within the 351–400 bracket internationally and ranked between 34th and 36th at the national level. The 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) placed the institution in the 601–700 range globally, and between 37th and 40th nationally.

==Notable faculty and alumni==

Next to Liebig, famous professors at the university included the physician Georg Haas (who carried out the world&#x27;s first human hemodialysis in Giessen in 1924), the theologian Adolf von Harnack, the lawyer Rudolf von Jhering, the economist and statistician Etienne Laspeyres, the physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, the mathematicians Moritz Pasch and Alfred Clebsch, the gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, the philologist and archaeologist Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, the orientalists Friedrich Schwally, Paul E. Kahle and Eberhard Schrader, and the president of Hebrew University of Jerusalem Benjamin Mazar.

<doc id="539045" wikidata="Q244320" url="?curid=539045" title="Ross's goose">
<text>Ross&#x27;s goose (Anser rossii), formerly Chen rossii, is a white goose with black wingtips and a relatively short neck. It is the smallest of the three white geese that breed in North America. It is similar in appearance to a white-phase snow goose, but about 40% smaller. Other differences from the snow goose are that the bill is smaller in proportion to its body and lacks &quot;black lips&quot;. Like snow geese, Ross&#x27;s geese may exhibit a darker &quot;blue&quot; phase or morph, though this is extremely rare (&lt;0.01% of adult birds).

Before the early 1900s, this goose was considered a rare species, possibly as a consequence of open hunting, but numbers have increased dramatically as a result of conservation measures. It is now listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, and is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

Ross&#x27;s goose is named in honor of Bernard R. Ross (1827–1874), who was associated with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories. Members of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were the first Europeans to discover the arctic nesting grounds of Ross&#x27;s geese in 1940. The first recognizable description of Ross&#x27;s geese, under the name &quot;horned wavey&quot;, was given by explorer Samuel Hearne eighty years before John Cassin named it after Ross.

== Description ==
Ross&#x27;s goose have a rounded head above a short neck. The bill is short and triangular, and has a bluish base with warty structures that increase in prominence with age. Adults are identified by all-white secondary feathers, while juveniles&#x27; will be dark centered. Females average 6% smaller than males. Legs will begin as olive gray on goslings and turn deep red as they mature.

There is no geographic variation or identified subspecies. Related species include other &quot;Anser&quot; geese, particularly the lesser snow goose, where the two mtDNA lineages imply frequent hybridization. Two hypotheses about the evolution of Ross&#x27;s goose are that they arose from a population of snow geese that were isolated by glacial advance or in a refugium that remained ice free.

Measurements:

* Male
** Length: 23.2–25.2 in (59–64 cm)
** Weight: 42.3–55.3 oz (1198–1567 g)
** Wingspan: 44.5-45.7 in (113–116 cm)
* Female
** Length: 22.6–24.4 in (57.3–62 cm)
** Weight: 37.6–51.3 oz (1066–1454 g)

== Taxonomy ==
Ross&#x27;s geese, along with other &quot;white geese&quot; (i.e., snow goose, emperor goose) previously belonged to the genus &quot;Chen&quot;, however, recent genetic sequencing has concluded that this genus was polyphyletic with the &quot;Anser&quot; genus, where most taxonomists now place Ross&#x27;s goose and its allies. 

Members of the &quot;Chen&quot; genus were officially transferred to &quot;Anser&quot; in the International Ornithological Committee&#x27;s World Bird List version 6.3 in 2016.

== Habitat ==
Landscape in the central Arctic is dominated by flat plains with some rock outcrops and drumlins, wet meadows, and marshy tundra. Vegetation includes patches of dwarf birch, willow, grasses, sedges, and low-growing vascular plants including crowberry, lapland rosebay, and lousewort. Large colonies of nesting birds can cause extensive damage to plants by overgrazing.

== Behavior ==
Ross&#x27;s geese form large nesting colonies on islands in shallow lakes and adjacent mainland, building nests on the ground made of twigs, leaves, grass, moss, and down. Females lay an average of 4 eggs per clutch and incubate the nest for 21–23 days.

A study of ground-based sampling along the McConnell River on the west coast of Hudson Bay reported a population of about 81,000 nesting Ross&#x27;s geese.

These birds migrate from their Canadian nesting grounds by mid-October, probably in response to limited food before freezing temperatures set in, and begin their return in mid-April to May.

Like most geese, they are grazers that feed on grasses, sedges, and small grains. They often forage in large mixed flocks with snow geese.
== Conservation and management ==
The number of nesting birds in the Queen Maud Gulf hit a record low of 2,000-3,000 in the early 1950s due to extensive shooting and trapping and their subsequent sale in California markets. Hunting of Ross&#x27;s geese was made illegal in the U.S. in 1931. When populations on wintering grounds began to increase again, restricted hunting was introduced. Today, Ross&#x27;s goose is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

Stephen Chow Sing-chi (; born 22 June 1962) is a Hong Kong filmmaker, former actor and comedian, known for his Mo lei tau style, comic timing and stunts. After appearing in many Hong Kong television series, Chow&#x27;s first major breakthrough was the 1989 comedy series &quot;The Final Combat&quot;. He then starred in the 1991 action comedy film &quot;Fight Back to School&quot;, which became one of the highest-grossing film of all-time in Hong Kong. He later reprised his role in its sequels. In 1994, he made his directorial debut with &quot;From Beijing with Love&quot;.

In 2001, Chow directed and starred in the sports comedy film &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;, which had a successful worldwide theatrical run and brought Chow into the North American mainstream. This commercial 
success was followed by the 2004 martial arts action comedy &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;. The film received positive reviews and grossed over US$106 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing foreign-language films in the United States. Chow&#x27;s final film acting performance, before he became a fulltime filmmaker, was in the 2008 science fiction comedy &quot;CJ7&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Stephen Chow was born in Hong Kong on 22 June 1962 to Ling Po-yee (), an alumna of Guangzhou Normal University, and Chow Yik-sheung (), an immigrant from Ningbo, Zhejiang. Chow has an elder sister named Chow Man-kei () and a younger sister named Chow Sing-ha (). Chow&#x27;s given name &quot;Sing-chi&quot; () derives from Tang dynasty (618–907) Chinese poet Wang Bo&#x27;s essay &quot;Preface to the Prince of Teng&#x27;s Pavilion&quot;. After his parents divorced when he was seven, Chow was raised by his mother. Chow attended Heep Woh Primary School, a missionary school attached to the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China in Prince Edward Road, Kowloon Peninsula. When he was nine, he saw Bruce Lee&#x27;s film &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, which inspired him to become a martial arts star. Chow entered San Marino Secondary School, where he studied alongside Lee Kin-yan. After graduation, he joined the TVB&#x27;s acting classes.

==Career==
Chow began his career as an extra for Rediffusion Television. Around 1980 he applied for TVB&#x27;s famous artist training course alongside his friend, Tony Leung Chiu-wai. Leung Chiu-wai won a place in the class, but Chow was rejected and became an office assistant for a shipping company, a job he describes as &quot;so boring.&quot; A year later, his friend and neighbor, Jaime Chik Mei-jan, a veteran of the previous year&#x27;s training course, put in a word for Chow and he was admitted to the 1982 training class.

He captured the attention of the public as host of the TVB Jade children&#x27;s program &quot;430 Space Shuttle&quot;. He stayed with the show for five years. Producer and actor Danny Lee signed him to a two year contract with his company, Magnum Films, and cast him in a supporting role in the crime drama &quot;Final Justice&quot; (1988), which won him the Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Horse Awards.

For the next two years, Chow capitalized on that success, working non-stop. He shot to further television stardom in the TVB &quot;wuxia&quot; series, &quot;The Final Combat&quot; (1989). In addition to shooting the 30 episodes of &quot;The Final Combat&quot;, he also appeared in 12 feature films during that same period, most of them triad movies, action films, or dramas. Jeff Lau directed him in the police thriller, &quot;Thunder Cops II&quot; (1989), and remembered him in early 1990 when producer Ng See-yuen tried to capitalize on the success of the previous year&#x27;s hit Chow Yun-fat vehicle, &quot;God of Gamblers&quot;. Chow would not return to shoot a sequel and so, sensing a hole in the marketplace, Ng hired Jeff Lau to direct a parody. Remembering his work with Stephen Chow, Lau hired him to star, pairing him with Sharla Cheung (who would appear as Chow&#x27;s co-star in 12 more films) and Ng Man-tat, a big star in the Seventies before a gambling addiction wrecked his career. He was then trying to make a comeback as a character actor.

&quot;All for the Winner&quot; (1990) became the highest grossing Hong Kong film of all time and the number one film for the year. Wong Jing hired Chow to star in the official sequels &quot;God of Gamblers II&quot; (1990) and &quot;God of Gamblers III: Back to Shanghai&quot; (1991) sequels which Wong wrote and directed (Chow Yun-fat would return to the role he made famous in 1994&#x27;s &quot;God of Gamblers Return&quot;, also written and directed by Wong). Lau had vowed never to work with Stephen Chow again after &quot;All for the Winner&quot; and so when it came time to make the sequel to that hit, Stephen Chow only appeared in a brief cameo.

After &quot;All for the Winner&quot;, Chow had two more major hits, &quot;God of Gamblers II&quot; and &quot;Tricky Brains&quot; that grossed HK$40 million and HK$31 million respectively at the box office, but they were followed by what appeared to be a fall from grace as the sequel to &quot;All for the Winner&quot;, &quot;The Top Bet&quot;, under-performed at the local box office, and his next films, &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury 1991&quot; failed to crack the HK$25 million barrier. &quot;City Entertainment&quot; magazine reported that Chow&#x27;s career was over and he was repeating himself after the hit that was &quot;All for the Winner&quot;. Win&#x27;s Entertainment courted writer and director Gordon Chan to helm Chow&#x27;s next project, &quot;Fight Back to School&quot; (1991). Chan claims he was unsatisfied with the script and rewrote the film as an outline with 15 bullet points and the rest of the movie was improvised. The result was a movie that cast Chow in a heroic lead role and the result was HK$43 million at the local box office, a new franchise (there would be sequels in 1992 and 1993), and in what&#x27;s considered a local benchmark of success, it represented the first time Chow unseated Jackie Chan from the number one spot at the Hong Kong box office.

Over the next decade, Chow appeared in more than 40 films. and wind up taking the number one spot at the box office eight times over the course of his career. Often, more than one of his movies would appear in the top ten, as in 1992 when all five of the top spots were held by Chow&#x27;s films. (Jackie Chan would not retake the number one spot until 1995.)

In 1994, Chow teamed up with director Lee Lik-chi and writer Vincent Kok for &quot;Love On Delivery&quot;, a movie that would only be the sixth highest-grossing movie of the year, a significant step down in status. Fortunately, Chow re-teamed with Kok and Lee again that same year for a James Bond parody he&#x27;s credited as co-writing and co-directing, and &quot;From Beijing with Love&quot; became the number three movie at the annual box office, beaten only by Chow Yun-fat&#x27;s return to the &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; franchise and Jackie Chan&#x27;s return to the character of a young Wong Fei-hung in &quot;Drunken Master II&quot;, a character he&#x27;d last played in 1978 in the first &quot;Drunken Master&quot;.

Around this time, Chow established his own film production company, Choi Sing Company (variously translated as Caixing Film Company and Hong Kong Color Star Film Company), and approached Jeff Lau about writing and directing his next movie. Lau told Chow that if he kept making the same movie over and over again he would never find popularity with female audiences and he needed to play a romantic lead. In a hotel meeting, he pitched Chow on filming a two-part adaptation of the classic Chinese novel, Journey to the West, and Chow agreed. In order to shoot on Mainland locations the movie became a Mainland-Hong Kong co-production between Chow&#x27;s Choi Sing Company and Xi&#x27;an Film Studios. The remote Xi&#x27;an Studios had always encouraged innovation and become home to China&#x27;s celebrated wave of Fifth Generation arthouse directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige and they were reluctant to work with a commercial, Hong Kong production. However, recent cuts in government subsidies forced them to look for new sources of financing and they embraced the co-production model. The resulting shoot was chaotic, with the Hong Kong crew speaking only Cantonese and the Mainland crew speaking Mandarin. Actors like Lu Shuming and Wu Yujin said they had very little idea of what was going on and actor Law Kar-ying described Chow as &quot;arrogant.&quot; The two films were titled &quot;A Chinese Odyssey Part One - Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; and &quot;A Chinese Odyssey Part Two - Cinderella&quot; and released in January and February, 1995 where they underperformed at the box office, leading to Choi Sing Film Company declaring bankruptcy. Chow, however, earned substantial money from the movie over the years through licensing and advertising opportunities and in the late &#x27;90s and early 2000s it became a cult favorite in the Mainland with phrases, expressions, and memes from the two films becoming a foundational part of early Chinese internet culture. This also became known in part as the &quot;Stephen Chow Phenomenon&quot; (周星驰现象).

=== 2001–2010: International stardom ===
In 2001, his film &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; grossed over US$50 million worldwide. Chow won Best Director and Best Actor at the 2002 Hong Kong Film Awards, and the film went on to garner additional awards including a Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and the Golden Bauhinia Award for Best Picture and Best Director. It was the highest-grossing Chinese film in Hong Kong at the time, grossing $46 million in the Asia region.

In 2004, his film &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot; grossed over US$106 million worldwide. Chow also won Best Director at the Taiwan Golden Horse Awards and Best Picture of Imagine Film Festival as well as over twenty international awards. Comedian Bill Murray said that the film was &quot;the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy&quot;.

His final role film &quot;CJ7&quot; began filming in July 2006 in the eastern Chinese port of Ningbo. In August 2007, the film was given the title &quot;CJ7&quot;, a play on China&#x27;s successful Shenzhou crewed space missions—Shenzhou 5 and Shenzhou 6.

For his work in comedy, he has received praise from notable institutions such as the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has called him the King of Comedy.

=== 2010–present: Focus on directing ===

In 2010, he became the executive director and major shareholder of 比高集團(BingoGroup Limited).

In 2013, his film &quot;Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons&quot; was the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time.

In 2016, his film &quot;The Mermaid&quot; broke numerous box office records, and became the highest-grossing film of 2016 in China. &quot;The Mermaid&quot; was released in Vietnam on 10 February 2016. On 14 March, it became the third-highest-grossing film of all time in Vietnam. It has now grossed over US$553.81 million worldwide. Chow became the ninth-top-grossing Hollywood Director in 2016.

Chow spent 4 years writing, directing and producing the remake of his 1999 film &quot;King of Comedy&quot;, the film was titled &quot;The New King of Comedy&quot;, released in February 2019.

==Personal life==
Chow and Jacqueline Law met while filming the TV series &quot;The Final Combat&quot; in 1989 and began dating shortly thereafter. In the autumn of 1992, they broke up. Law later struggled with depression and recalled mentioning marriage to Chow, only to be dismissed as “crazy,” which left her heartbroken: “I longed to start a family with him, but he treated me like a lunatic.” Years later, when Law announced she had cancer, Chow was working on &quot;Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons&quot;. Among other memorial references, he named the film’s female lead Miss Duan, referencing &quot;The Final Combat&quot;, where Chow and Law portrayed Mr. and Mrs. Duan. The film premiered after Law&#x27;s death.

Chow and Athena Chu started dating after working together on &quot;Fight Back to School&quot;. Their secret relationship lasted for more than three years, ending due to Chow&#x27;s alleged infidelity. In a 2008 interview on &quot;Be My Guest&quot;, Chu recalled the breakup: &quot;One day, after wrapping up work, I went to visit my boyfriend’s room. The door was locked, and when he opened it, he looked flustered. I touched the bed, and it was warm, while the bathroom door was locked from the inside.&quot; Chu stated that she didn&#x27;t know who the other person was and suspected there were more than just one. Despite this, Chu continued to work alongside Chow until the film finished. Karen Mok, the often suspected mistress at the time, denied being involved with anyone during the filming of &quot;A Chinese Odyssey&quot;. According to Tiffany Chen, however, during the filming Chow had relationships with Yammie Lam, Chu and Mok.

From 1995 to 1998, Chow dated actress and singer Karen Mok, who has starred alongside him in several films.

Chow had a relationship with Alice Yu Man-fung, daughter of business mogul Yu Ching-Po, for 12 to 13 years until March 2010, during which Yu also assisted Chow with personal investments and was paid a salary based on a written contract from 2002, initially at HK$20,000 a month. Chow had paid Yu HK$19.5 million at her request between 2007 and 2011, and an additional HK$10 million in February 2012 in “appreciation for [her] friendship and support over the years”. In September 2012, Yu filed a lawsuit against Chow, asserting that there was an additional oral agreement purportedly reached around Christmas of 2002 for Chow to pay her a 10 per cent share of net profits on all successful investments she recommended. Yu’s claim for damages of some HK$80 million was based on her purported share of the profits from Chow’s investments in his current luxury home at 12 Pollock’s Path on The Peak, three houses at The Beverley Hills in Tai Po and a private equity fund. In 2021, a lower court ruled the pair never made that deal, a decision that was upheld on appeal.

==Political views==
In 2013, Stephen Chow was elected a member of the 11th Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). According to media exposure, Chow often arrives late and leaves early at the conference, and has not put forward any proposals.

<text>A share taxi, shared taxi, taxibus, or jitney or dollar van in the US, or [[marshrutka]] in former Soviet countries, is a mode of transport which falls between a taxicab and a bus. Share taxis are a form of paratransit. They are vehicles for hire and are typically smaller than buses. Share taxis usually take passengers on a fixed or semi-fixed route without timetables, sometimes only departing when all seats are filled. They may stop anywhere to pick up or drop off their passengers. They are most common in developing countries and inner cities.

The vehicles used as share taxis range from four-seat cars to minibuses, midibuses, covered pickup trucks, station wagons, and trucks. Certain vehicle types may be better-suited than others. They are often owner-operated.

An increase in bus fares usually leads to a significant rise in usage of share taxis. Liberalization is often encouraged by libertarian urban economists, such as Richard Allen Epstein of the University of Chicago, James Dunn of Rutgers, and Peter Gordon of the University of Southern California, as a more &quot;market-friendly&quot; alternative to public transportation. However, concerns over fares, insurance liabilities, and passenger safety have kept legislative support for decidedly tepid.

Some share taxi services are forms of demand responsive transport and include shared shuttle bus service to airports. Some can be booked online using mobile apps.

==Operation==
===Terminus===
A given share taxi route may start and finish in fixed central locations, and landmarks may serve as route names or route termini. 

In other places there may be no formal termini, with taxis simply congregating at a central location, instead.

Even more-formal terminals may just parking lots.

The term &quot;rank&quot; denotes an area, specifically built for taxi operators by a municipality or city, where commuters may start and end their journey.

===Route===
Where they exist, shared taxis provide service on set routes within and sometimes between towns.

After a shared taxi has picked up passengers at its terminus, it proceeds along a semi-fixed route where the driver may determine the actual route within an area according to traffic conditions. Drivers will stop anywhere to allow riders to disembark, and may sometimes do the same when prospective passengers want to ride.

===Vehicle ownership===
Most share taxis are operated under one of two regimes. Some share taxis are operated by a company. For example, in Dakar there are company-owned fleets of hundreds of &quot;car rapides&quot;. In the Soviet Union, share taxis, known as &quot;marshrutka&quot;, were operated by state-owned taxi parks. There are also individual operators in many countries. In Africa, while there are company share taxis, individual owners are more common. Rarely owning more than two vehicles at a time, they will rent out a minibus to operators, who pay fuel and other running costs, and keep revenue. 

====Syndicates====
In some places, like some African cities and also Hong Kong, share taxi minibuses are overseen by syndicates, unions, or route associations. These groups often function in the absence of a regulatory environment and may collect dues or fees from drivers (such as per-use terminal payments, sometimes illegally), set routes, manage terminals, and fix fares. Terminal management may include ensuring each vehicle leaves with a full load of passengers.

Because the syndicates represent owners, their regulatory efforts tend to favor operators rather than passengers, and the very termini syndicates upkeep can cost delays and money for passengers as well as forcing them to disembark at inconvenient locations, in a phenomenon called &quot;terminal constraint&quot;.

==By location==
===Africa===

Some Francophone African countries use the term (&#x27;bush taxi&#x27;, often spelled with a space rather than a hyphen in English) for share taxis.

In some African cities, routes are run between formal termini, where the majority of passengers board. In these places, the share taxis wait for a full load of passengers prior to departing, and off-peak wait times may be in excess of an hour.

In Africa, regulation is mainly something that pertains to the vehicle itself not its operator or its mode of operation.

African minibuses are difficult to tax, and may operate in a &quot;regulatory vacuum&quot; perhaps because their existence is not part of a government scheme, but is simply a market response to a growing demand for such services. Route syndicates and operator&#x27;s associations often exercise unrestricted control, and existing rules may see little enforcement.

In many traffic-choked, sprawling, and low-density African cities, minibuses are used.
Some or even most African bush taxis are old Peugeot and Renault models. (specifically Peugeot 504 and Peugeot 505 models).

====Algeria====
In Algeria, &quot;taxis collectifs&quot; ply fixed routes with their destination displayed. Rides are shared with others who are picked up along the way, and the taxi will leave only when it seats all the passengers it can. While stations, set locations to board and disembark, exist, prospective passengers flag down a &quot;taxi collectif&quot; when they want a ride.

Operating inter- and intra-city, &quot;taxis collectifs&quot; that travel between towns may be called &quot;interwilaya taxis&quot;.

Along with all forms of public transport in Algeria, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada recommend against using these share taxis. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs asks that you use taxis recommended by a hotel.

====Burkina Faso====
In Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, the share taxi or role is not filled by the traditional African minibus.

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====
Those in Kinshasa, DRC, (or perhaps just the Kongo people) may call share taxis &quot;fula fula&quot; meaning &quot;quick quick&quot;.

There was no independent transport authority in the city of Kinshasa as of 2008.

====Cameroon====
Share taxis do exist in Cameroon, but as of 2008 minibuses cannot be used for this purpose, by law. That same year, Douala, Cameroon, also was without an independent transport authority.

====Egypt====
Egyptian share cabs are generally known as micro-bus (&#x27; or &#x27; , &quot;project&quot;; plural &#x27; or &#x27; ). The second name is used by Alexandrians.

Micro-buses are licensed by each of the governorates of Egypt as taxicabs, and are generally operated privately by their drivers. Although each governorate attempts to maintain a consistent paint scheme for them, in practice the color of them varies wildly, as the &quot;consistent&quot; schemes have changed from time to time and many drivers have not bothered to repaint their cars.

Rates vary depending on distance traveled, although these rates are generally well known to those riding the micro-bus. The fares also depend on the city. Riders can typically hail micro-buses from any point along the route, often with well-established hand signals indicating the prospective rider&#x27;s destination, although certain areas tend to be well-known micro-bus stops.

Like the Eastern European &quot;marshrutka&quot;, a typical micro-bus is a large van, most often a Toyota HiAce or its Jinbei equivalent, the Haise, and the latter is produced by the Bavarian Auto Manufacturing Group in 6th of October City in Egypt. Smaller vans and larger small buses are also used.

====Ethiopia====
Minibus taxis in Ethiopia are one of the most important modes of transport in big cities like Addis Ababa. They are preferred by the majority of the populace over public buses and more traditional taxicabs because they are generally cheap, operate on diverse routes, and are available in abundance. All minibus taxis in Ethiopia have a standard blue-and-white coloring scheme, much as New York taxis are yellow. Minibus taxis are usually Toyota HiAces, frequent the streets. They typically can carry 11 passengers, but will always have room for another until that is no longer the case. The minibus driver has a crew member called a &quot;weyala&quot; whose job is to collect the fare from passengers.

In 2008, publicly operated public transport was available in Addis Ababa in addition to that provided by the minibuses. A fleet of 350 large buses may operate for this purpose, as such a number does exist. Also as of 2008, the city lacks an independent transport authority, but some regulation, such as that controlling market entry, does exist.

Route syndicates may be present but are described as &quot;various&quot;.

====Ghana====

In Ghana and neighboring countries, share taxis are called &quot;tro tro&quot;. They are privately owned minibus that travel fixed routes and leave when filled to capacity. While there are &quot;tro tro&quot; stations, these shared taxis can also be boarded anywhere along the route.

Operated by a driver and a bus conductor, who collects money, shouts out the destination, and is called a &quot;mate&quot;, many are decorated with slogans and sayings, often religious, and few operate on Sundays. A 2010 report by The World Bank found that &quot;Tro tro&quot; are used by 70% of Ghanaian commuters. This popularity may be because in cities such as Accra had only basic public transportation save for these small minibuses. An informal means of transportation, in Ghana they are licensed by the government, but the industry is self-regulated. In Accra, syndicates include GPRTU and PROTOA.

Aayalolo, a bus rapid transit system opened in November 2016; however, most people continued to use trotros as of 2019.

The term &quot;tro tro&quot; is believed to derive from the Ga word &quot;tro&quot;, &quot;threepence&quot;, because the conductors usually asked for &quot;three three pence&quot;, which was the standard bus fare in the 1940s, when Ghana still used the British West African pound and later the Ghanaian pound. Alternatively, its origin is not &quot;three times three pence&quot; but rather &quot;threepence [thruhpnce, tro] each&quot;: doubling a coin&#x27;s name in the vernacular means &quot;that coin for each person (or item)&quot;. Three pence was the price per passenger in the early 1960s, when pounds/shillings/pence were still in use, including threepence coins, before decimalization of the currency into cedi and pesewa in 1965.
In Ghana, &quot;tro tro&quot; are licensed by the government, but the industry is self-regulated. There was no independent transport authority as of 2008 in the capital, Accra. In the absence of a regulatory environment, groups called syndicates oversee share taxis. These may collect dues, set routes, manage terminals, and fix fares. In Accra as of 2008, such syndicates include Ghana Private Road Transport Union and PROTOA.

Despite the regulatory challenges, the service was regulated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. There was 98% compliance to guidelines on physical distancing, although guidelines on individual use of face masks were more difficult to enforce. 

====Ivory Coast====
In the Ivory Coast, &quot;gbaka&quot; is a name for minibus public transports. The transport regulator in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is &quot;Agence de Gestion des Transports Urbains&quot; or AGETU. As of 2008, Abidjan public transport was serviced by large buses as well as minibuses. Syndicates include UPETCA and SNTMVCI.

====Kenya====
In Kenya, regulation does extend to operators and mode of operation (such as routes used) as well as the vehicle.

====Madagascar====
====Mali====
In Mali, share taxis are called &quot;sotrama&quot; and &quot;dourouni&quot;. As of 2008, Bamako, Mali, has no independent transport authority, but share taxi activity could fall under regulator &quot;Direction de la régulation et du contrôle du transport urbain (municipal)&quot; or DRCTU control.

====Morocco====
In Morocco, intercity share taxis are called &quot;grand taxis&quot;. They are generally old full-size Mercedes-Benz sedans, and seat six or more passengers.

====Nigeria====

In Nigeria, both minibusses (called &quot;danfo&quot;) and midibuses (&quot;molue&quot;) may be operated as share taxis. Such forms of public transport may also be referred to as &quot;bolekaja&quot;, and many bear slogans or sayings.

Lagos, Nigeria, has a transport-dedicated regulator, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Agency (LAMATA). Outside of Lagos, most major cities in Africa have similar systems of transport. Syndicates in Lagos include the National Union of Road and Transport Workers (NURTW).

====Rwanda====

Minibus public transports in Rwanda may be called coaster buses, share taxis, or &quot;twegerane&quot;. The latter could easily be a word meaning &quot;stuffed&quot; or &quot;full&quot;. As of 2020, in Kigali, Rwanda, syndicates include RFTC, Kigali Bus Services, and Royal Express.

====South Africa====

Over 60% of South African commuters use shared minibus taxis, which are 16 seater commuter buses, sometimes referred to as &quot;kombis&quot;. Many of these vehicles are unsafe and not roadworthy, and often dangerously overloaded. Since the 1980s, share taxis have been severely affected by turf wars. Prior to 1987, the taxi industry in South Africa was highly regulated and controlled. Black taxi operators were declined permits in the Apartheid era and all minibus taxi operations were, by their very nature, illegal. Post-1987, the industry was rapidly deregulated, leading to an influx of new minibus taxi operators, keen to make money off the high demand for this service. Taxi operators banded together to form local and national associations. Because the industry was largely unregulated and the official regulating bodies corrupt, these associations soon engaged in anti-competitive price fixing and exhibited gangster tactics – including the hiring of hit-men and all-out gang warfare. During the height of the conflict, it was common for taxi drivers to carry shotguns and AK-47s to simply shoot rival taxi drivers and their passengers on sight.

Along with new legislation, the government has instituted a recapitalization scheme to replace the old and un-roadworthy vehicles with new 18- and 35-seater minibusses. These new minibus taxis carry the South African flag on the side and are notably more spacious and safe.

====Tanzania====
Minivans and minibuses are used as vehicles for hire and referred to as &quot;dala dala&quot; in Tanzania. While &quot;dala dala&quot; may run fixed routes picking up passengers at central locations, they will also stop along the route to drop someone off or allow a prospective passenger to board. Before minibuses became widely used, the typical &quot;dala dala&quot; was a pick-up truck with benches placed in the truck bed.

In Dar es Salaam, as of 2008, publicly operated minibus service also exists.

They are usually run by both a driver and a bus conductor called a &quot;mpigadebe&quot;, literally meaning &quot;a person who hits a debe&quot; (a 4-gallon tin container used for transporting gasoline or water). The name is in reference to the fact that conductors often hit the roof and side of the van to attract customers and to notify the driver when to leave the station.

Often crowded, they have their routes allocated by a Tanzania transport regulator, Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), but syndicates also exist and include DARCOBOA.

====Tunisia====

Share taxis in Tunisia are called &quot;louages&quot; and follow fixed or semi-fixed routes, departing from stations when full. In French, the name means &quot;rental.&quot; Departing only when filled with passengers not at specific times, they can be hired at stations. Louage ply set routes, and fares are set by the government. At most louage stations, tickets must be purchased at a booth and given to the driver.

In contrast to other share taxis in Africa, louage are sparsely decorated. These white vans sport a single colored stripe that alerts potential passengers to the type of transport they offer. Red-striped vans travel from one state to another, Blue which travels from city to city within a state, and yellow which serves rural locales. Blue-striped louage can also be seen. Small placards atop the vans specify either a van&#x27;s exact destination or the town in which it is registered.

Prior to the introduction of vans, French-made station wagons were used as louages.

====West Africa====
The term &quot;kia kia&quot; may be used in Yorùbáland to refer to minibus public transports, and means &quot;quick quick&quot;.

===Asia===
====Hong Kong====

Public light buses (), also known as minibus or maxicab (), run the length and breadth of Hong Kong, through areas which the standard bus lines cannot or do not reach as frequently, quickly or directly. They are 16 or 19 seater minibuses. Public Light Bus are differentiated from usual minibuses with their red coloured roof, and with very few exceptions, lack of route numbers. With no timetable, drivers can depart when they deem the passenger count on board is financially equitable. Special features include its high speeds (up to 110 km/h on some routes; which is illegal when exceeding the 80 km/h limit) and permission for the driver to end the journey prematurely, even with passengers on board. Although within their right to charge the full fare, drivers usually lower or omit the fare if they are unable to deliver the passenger to the promised destination.

Typically offering a faster and more efficient transportation solution due to their small size, limited carrying capacity, frequency, and diverse range of routes, although they are generally slightly more expensive than standard buses, minibusses carry a maximum of 19 seated passengers. Standing passengers are not allowed.

There are two types of public light minibus: green and red. Both types have a cream-coloured body, the distinguishing feature being the colour of the external roof, and the type of service that the colour denotes: green is like regular transit bus with fixed number, route, schedule and fare (but generally not fixed stops); red is a shared taxi, operating on semi-fixed route unregulated, with the driver waiting for enough passengers to justify leaving, as his income depends on the revenue.

====Cyprus====
In Cyprus, there are privately owned share taxis that travel to set destinations and board additional passengers en route called service taxis.

====India====
In India, several cities have minibuses apart from the presence of three-wheeler taxi-cabs called rickshaws. Minibuses are especially popular in the city of Kolkata for intra-city travel but are also present elsewhere. It is also a crucial mode of public transport in the Himalayan region and in the hilly tracts of Northeast India, as other modes of transport are infrequent or absent altogether.

Shared taxis have been operating in Mumbai, India, since the early 1970s. These are point-to-point services that operate during peak hours. During off-peak hours they ply like regular taxis; they can be hailed anywhere on the roads and passengers are charged by the meter. During peak hours they will take a full cab load of passengers to a more or less common destination. The pick-up points are usually fixed, and sometimes (but not always) marked by a sign saying &quot;shared taxis&quot;. Cabs typically line up at this point during peak hours.

They sometimes display their general destination on their windscreens, and passengers get in and wait for the cab to fill up, which leave when full. Fares are fixed and much lower than the metered fare to the same destination, but higher than a bus or train fare.

Such informal arrangements also exist in other Indian cities. Share jeeps are a common form of transportation in the Himalayas, the North Eastern States, and elsewhere.

====Indonesia====
Angkutan Kota (), abbreviated as angkot, are shared taxis in Indonesia widely operating throughout the country, usually with microbuses. In some places there were also three-wheelers which are called &quot;bemo&quot; (such as autorickshaws based on the Daihatsu Midget) but these have been phased out. The older version of Angkot is called &quot;oplet&quot;. The name of this transportation differs from each different province or area in the country. In Jakarta, it is called &quot;angkot&quot; or &quot;mikrotrans&quot;, in other parts such as in Sulawesi, the term &quot;mikrolet&quot; (shortened &quot;mikro&quot;) is more widely used especially in Manado. In Makassar it is called &quot;pete-pete&quot;, in Malang it is called &quot;angkota&quot;, in Medan it is called &quot;sudako&quot;, in Indonesian Papua it is called &quot;taksi&quot;, in Aceh it is called &quot;labi-labi&quot;, and in Samarinda it is called &quot;minibus&quot; (but even within the city itself is also called &quot;angkot&quot;).

Share taxis operated across rural/village routes are called angkutan desa (), abbreviated as &quot;angkudes. Angkot&quot; and &quot;angkudes&quot; run accordingly to their exact routes and may stop at any class of bus stations (A, B, and C-Type bus stations). Additionally, passengers can stop the van anywhere along its route, and it is not required to stop at a bus stop.

On late 2024, Jakarta and Surabaya have modern share taxis operating in the city area, both operated by Transjakarta and Suroboyo Bus.

====Iran====
In Iran, a share taxi is usually called &quot;taxi&quot;, while a non-share is called &quot;ajans&quot;/اژانس, pronounced [aʒans]. Four passengers share a taxi and sometimes there is no terminus and they wait in the street side and blare their destination to all taxis until one of them stops. These are regular taxis but if somebody wants to get a non-share taxi he can call for an ajans (taxi service) for himself or wait in the street side and say &quot;Darbast&quot; (which means non-share). It means he is not interested in sharing the taxi and is consequently willing to pay more for the privilege.

Minibuses, with a capacity of 18 passengers, and van taxis, with a capacity of 10 passengers are other kinds of share transport in Iran.

====Israel====
In &quot;monit sherut&quot;, pl. &quot;moniyot sherut&quot; is a word meaning &quot;service taxi&quot;. Referring to vans or minibuses that serve as share taxis in Israel, these can be picked up from anywhere on their route. They follow fixed routes (sometimes the same routes as public transport buses) and usually leave from the initial station only when full. &quot;Moniyot sherut&quot; operate both inter- and intra-city. Payment is often done by passing money to the driver in a &quot;human chain&quot; formed by the passengers seated before. The change (and the receipt, when requested) are returned to the person who paid by the same means. In intra-city routes, where they compete with official buses, the drivers usually coordinate their travel by radio so that they can arrive at the bus station just before public transport buses and take the most passengers.

Monit sherut is one of the only forms of transit accessible to many Israelis during Shabbat, as most public transportation in the country closes down between sunset on Friday and nightfall on Saturday.

In Israel, Mercedes are used, owned generally by Arabs, and very efficient, having space for 7–8 people, and having loosely fixed routes, dropping a passenger either at a specific terminus or going a little out of the way to facilitate the passenger.

====Philippines====

The most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines as of 2007, jeepneys were originally made out of US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known for their color and flamboyant decoration. The jeepneys are built by local automobile repair shops from a combination of prefabricated elements (from a handful of Filipino manufacturers) and improvisation and in most cases equipped with &quot;surplus&quot; or used Japanese SUV or light truck engines, drive train, suspension and steering components (from recycled vehicles in Japan).

They have not changed much since their post-war creation, even in the face of increased access to pre-made vehicles, such as minibuses. However, due to the government&#x27;s Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program, Jeepneys and other modes of transportation must comply to the newer Philippine National Standards which is more compliant with international standards.

Older jeepneys have the entrance on the back, and there is space for two people beside the driver (or more if they are small) while the modern jeepneys have two doors on the right side of the vehicle. The back cab of the Jeepney is equipped with two long bench seats along the sides and the people seated closest to the driver are responsible for passing the fare of new passengers forward to the driver and the change back to the passenger. The start and end point of the jeepney route is often a jeepney terminal, where there is a queue system so only one jeepney plying a particular route is filled at a time, and where a person helps the driver to collect fares and fill the vehicles with people, usually to more than comfortable capacity.

Preferring to leave only when full and only stop for a crowd of potential passengers, riders can nonetheless disembark at any time; and while jeepneys ply fixed routes, these may be subject to change over time. New ones may need approval from a Philippine transport regulator. Jeepney stations do exist.

Another share taxi that is also common in the Philippines is the UV Express which uses Compact MPVs and vans as its form factor. These vehicles seat 10–18 people and charge an additional 2 Philippine peso per kilometer (as of 2013).

====Thailand====
Literally &quot;two rows&quot; a &quot;songthaew&quot; or &quot;song thaew&quot; (Thai สองแถว, Lao: ສອງແຖວ [sɔ̌ːŋtʰíw]) is a passenger vehicle in Thailand and Laos adapted from a pick-up or a larger truck and used as a share taxi. They are also known as baht buses.

====Turkey and Northern Cyprus====
In Turkey and Northern Cyprus, &quot;dolmuşlar&quot; (singular &quot;dolmuş&quot;, pronounced &quot;dolmush&quot;) are share taxis that run on set routes within and between cities. These cars or minibuses display their routes on a signboard behind the windscreen. Some cities may only allow &quot;dolmuş&quot; to pick up and drop passengers at designated stops, and terminals also exist. The word derives from Turkish for &quot;full&quot; or &quot;stuffed&quot;, as these share taxis depart from the terminal only when a sufficient number of passengers have boarded. Visitors to Turkey have been surprised by the speed of &quot;dolmuş&quot; travel.

Traveling intra and inter-city, the privately owned minibuses are overseen by a governance institution; routes are leased and vehicles licensed. Passengers board anywhere along the route as well as at termini and official stations. &quot;Dolmuşlar&quot; in Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus display their routes but don&#x27;t follow timetables.

====West Bank, Palestine ====
Share taxis are often called &quot;ser-vees&quot; (service taxi) in the West Bank. Minibuses are often used in lieu of vans. Ford Transit vans were often a popular vehicle for conversion, resulting in the generic trademark &quot;Ford&quot; and &quot;Fordat&quot;(pl) being used to describe minibusses of various makes, replacing aging Mercedes sedans.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
In New Zealand the first widespread motor vehicle services were shared taxi services termed &quot;service cars&quot;; a significant early provider was Aard, operating elongated Hudson Super Sixes. By 1930, there were 597 service cars. Aard was taken over by New Zealand Railways Road Services in 1928. 

Shared taxis in New Zealand nowadays are referred to as &quot;shuttles&quot; or &quot;shuttle vans&quot;.

Shared buses or vans are available in many more developed countries connecting frequent destinations, charging a fixed fee per passenger. The most common case is a connection between an airport and central city locations. These services are often known as shuttles. Such services usually use smaller vehicles than normal buses and often operate on demand. An air traveler can contact the shuttle company by telephone or Internet, not necessarily in advance; the company will ensure that a shuttle is provided without unreasonable delay. The shuttle will typically connect one airport with several large hotels, or addresses in a specified area of the city. The shuttle offers much of the convenience of a taxi, although it takes longer, at a price that is significantly lower for one or two passengers. Scheduled services between an airport and a hotel, usually operated by the hotel, are also called shuttles. In many cases the shuttle operator takes the risk of there not being enough passengers to make the trip profitable; in others, there is a minimum charge when there are not enough passengers.

Usually, there are regulations covering vehicles and drivers; for example in New Zealand under NZTA regulations, shuttles are only allowed to have up to eleven passenger seats, and the driver must have a passenger endorsement (P) on their driver&#x27;s license.

===Europe===

====Former Soviet Union====

====Moldova====
In Moldova, share taxis are called rutierele (&quot;singular&quot; rutieră). Introduced in 1981, they are private, owner-operated minibuses that operate along fixed routes. In cities, each rutieră route has a given number, as in the case of buses or trolleybuses.

====Netherlands====
Besides the conventional &quot;deeltaxi&quot;, there are &quot;treintaxis&quot; in some Dutch towns. Operated on behalf of the Netherlands Railways, they run to and from railway stations and the ride is shared with additional passengers picked up along the way. Tickets can be purchased at railway ticket offices or from the cabdriver, but &quot;treintaxis&quot; must be ordered by phone unless boarding at a railway station.

====Bulgaria====

Marshrutkas are rare in Bulgaria. As of 2021, only a single route operates in Sofia, while 10 lines operate in Plovdiv. They are customized passenger vans that have been modified to include large windows in the back, rails and handles. Marshrutkas are commonly white, although their colour varied, and are partially covered in advertising. In some cases, seating has been modified — popular routes carrying more passengers typically have more standing space. Examples of van models include Peugeot Boxer, Citroën Jumper, Ford Transit, Iveco Daily and Renault Master. They have a fixed fare; the fare is paid upon boarding. Marshrutkas were not obliged to stop anywhere on the route, although they did slow down around popular spots. Marshrutka drivers were asked to stop and pick one up in a taxi-like manner; the getting-off was arranged with the driver, often by just standing up and approaching the door. Sometimes the driver would ask for consent to veer off the route to avoid a traffic jam or roadworks.

====Romania====
In Romania, &quot;microbuze&quot; or &quot;maxi-taxi&quot; supplied the need of affordable public transportation in smaller towns when some local administrations abolished the expensive community-owned systems of buses. In Bucharest, this form of transportation appeared in the early 1980s, when the ITB began using them as a peak-hour service, beginning to use Irannational-made Mercedes-Benz T2 vans, being supplemented in the late 1980s by Rocar-TV vans. In 1990, the newly founded RATB sold off its operations to private operators, who began using them in competition to the RATB. They enjoyed wide popularity, especially from 2003 to 2007, and from 2011 onwards, when the RATB lost the rights to operate suburban routes. On the Black Sea shore, it is very common to travel from Constanţa or Mangalia to the resorts on minibuses (microbuze), especially in those resorts where the competing train service is far from the beach and/or lodging facilities. These minibuses have been criticised for their shady operations, lack of safety and primitive transportation conditions.

====Greece====
In Athens, Greece most taxis were share taxis, but since the country joined the EU in 1981, this tradition started to disappear.

====United Kingdom====
In 2018, Arriva launched shared taxi service Arriva Click in Liverpool and Sittingbourne and Kent Science Park in the United Kingdom.

=====Northern Ireland=====
In some towns in Northern Ireland, notably certain districts in Ballymena, Belfast, Derry and Newry, share taxi services operate using Hackney carriages and are called black taxis. These services developed during The Troubles as public bus services were often interrupted due to street rioting. Taxi collectives are closely linked with political groups – those operating in Catholic areas with Sinn Féin, those in Protestant areas with loyalist paramilitaries and their political wings.

Typically, fares approximate those of Translink operated bus services on the same route. Service frequencies are typically higher than on-bus services, especially at peak times, although limited capacities mean that passengers living close to the termini may find it difficult to find a black taxi with seats available in the rush hour.

====Switzerland====
Major providers of share taxis in Switzerland are Telebus Kriens LU, Taxito, myBuxi, Kollibri by Swiss Postal Bus, and Pikmi by VBZ Verkehrsbetriebe Zurich ZH.

===North America===
====Barbados====
Most areas of Barbados are served by ZRs, which run in addition to the government-run bus service.

====Dominican Republic====
In the Dominican Republic, share taxis are privately owned vehicles running fixed routes with no designated stops.

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada advises against traveling in the Dominican Republic &quot;carros públicos&quot; because doing so makes passengers targets for robbery, and because the taxis are known to, &quot;disregard traffic laws, often resulting in serious accidents involving injuries and sometimes death.&quot; The United States Department of State also warns that using them is hazardous, due to pickpockets, and are sometimes passengers are robbed by the drivers themselves.

====Haiti====

&quot;Tap taps&quot;, gaily painted buses or pick-up trucks, and &quot;publiques&quot;, usually older saloon cars, serve as share taxis in Haiti. &quot;Tap taps&quot; are privately owned and ornately decorated. They follow fixed routes; won&#x27;t leave until filled with passengers; and many feature wild colors, portraits of famous people, and intricate, hand-cut wooden window covers. Often they are painted with religious names or slogans. Riders can disembark at any point in the journey. Their name refers to &quot;fast motion&quot;.

The &quot;publiques&quot; operate on fixed routes and pick up additional passengers all along the way.

While saying not to use any form of public transport in Haiti, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada advises against &quot;tap tap&quot; travel especially. The United States Department of State also warns travelers not to use &quot;tap taps&quot;, &quot;because they are often overloaded, mechanically unsound, and driven unsafely.&quot;

====Saint Lucia====
In Saint Lucia, waychehs are a name for minibus public transports using Toyota HiAce.

====Canada====

In Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in the 1920s, jitneys competed directly with the streetcar monopoly operating along the same routes as the streetcars, but jitneys were charging lower fares.

In Quebec, share taxis or jitneys are called &quot;taxis collectifs&quot; (in English &quot;shared taxis&quot;) or &quot;transport collectif par taxi&quot;, literally &quot;public transport by taxi&quot;. (which the STM translates in English as &quot;taxibus&quot;) and are operated by subcontractors to the local transit authorities on fixed routes.

In the case of Montréal, the fare is the same as the local bus fare, but no cash and transfers are issued or accepted; in the case of the STL, only bus passes. The Réseau de transport de Longueuil accepts regular RTL tickets and all RTL and some Réseau de transport métropolitain TRAM passes.

====Guatemala====
In Guatemala, &quot;ruleteros&quot;, minibus share taxis, pick up and discharge passengers along major streets.

====United States====
In the United States, share taxis are called jitneys or dollar vans. They are typically modified passenger vans, and often operate in urban neighborhoods that are underserved by public mass transit or taxis. Some are licensed and regulated, while others operate illegally. They operate at designated stops or can be hailed from the street.

Both common names – dollar van and jitney – originated similarly. Jitney is an archaic term for an American nickel, the common fare for early jitneys. In the late 20th century, when a typical fare was one dollar, the corresponding name came into usage, though &quot;jitney&quot; is still also common. It is generally a small-capacity vehicle that follows a rough service route, but it can go slightly out of its way to pick up and drop off passengers. In many US cities such as Pittsburgh and Detroit, the term &quot;jitney&quot; refers to an unlicensed taxi cab.

They are often owned and used by members of inner-city communities, such as African/Caribbean American, Latino, and Asian-American populations. Travelers cite cost and greater frequency as factors in choosing jitneys over larger bus service, whereas safety and comfort are cited for choosing buses.

The first jitneys in the United States operated in Los Angeles, California in 1914. By 1915, there were 62,000 nationwide. Local regulations, demanded by streetcar companies, forced jitneys out of business in most places. By the end of 1916, only 6,000 jitneys remained. Operators were referred to as &quot;jitney men.&quot; They were so successful that the city government banned them at the request of the streetcar operators.

====Atlanta====
Jitneys were popular in Atlanta from 1915 to 1925 as an alternative to streetcars. In Atlanta, jitneys run along Buford Highway.

====New York City====

In New York City, dollar vans serve major areas that lack adequate subway service in transit deserts. The vans pick up and drop off anywhere along a route, and payment is made at the end of a trip. During periods when limited public mass transit is unavailable, dollar vans were the only feasible method of transportation for many commuters. In such situations, city governments may pass legislation to deter price gouging. Most dollar vans operate illegally, due to possible rules and fines. Dollar vans and other jitneys mainly serve low-income, immigrant communities in transit deserts, which lack sufficient bus and subway service.

====New Jersey====
In New Jersey, 6,500 jitney buses are registered, and are required to have an &quot;Omnibus&quot; license plate, which denotes the vehicle&#x27;s federal registration. They are also required to undergo inspection by the state MVC mobile inspection team on the vehicles&#x27; companies&#x27; property twice a year, and be subject to surprise inspection. Drivers of jitneys are required to qualify for a Class B or Class C Commercial Drivers License (CDL), depending on whether the vehicle seats up to 15 or 30 passengers. Violations against a driver&#x27;s CDL must be resolved and result in payment of fines prior to resumption of driving on the driver&#x27;s part, with retesting required if the driver waits longer than three years to resolve the issues.

Denser urban areas of northern New Jersey, such as Hudson, Bergen and Passaic County, are also served by dollar vans, which are commonly known as jitneys, and most of which are run by Spanish Transportation and Community Line, Inc. Nungessers, along the Anderson Avenue-Bergenline Avenue transit corridor is a major origination/termination point, as are 42nd Street in Manhattan, Newport Mall and Five Corners in Jersey City, and GWB Plaza in Fort Lee. These interstate vans are under the purview of the federal government.
In Atlantic City the Atlantic City Jitney Association operates a jitney service that travels the main strip of casinos. One of the routes also services the new cluster of casinos west of Atlantic City proper.

Hudson County commuters who prefer NJ Transit buses, for example, cite senior citizen discounts and air conditioning among their reasons, which has led some jitney operators to display bumper stickers advertising air conditioning aboard their vehicles in order to lure passengers. Some who prefer the buses will nonetheless take the jitneys if they arrive before the buses, as they pass bus stops more frequently than the buses and are cheaper. Others choose buses because, they claim, jitney drivers are less safe, and are prone to using cell phones and playing loud music while driving. Although Union City jitney driver Samuel Martinez has complained that authorities unfairly target them and not the larger buses, North Bergen Patrol Commander Lt. James Somers has contended that jitneys are less safe, and sometimes exhibit higher levels of aggressive driving in order to pick up passengers, which has led to arguments among drivers. Somers also stated that police can only stop a vehicle that appears to have an obvious problem, and that only certified inspectors from the state MVC can stop a vehicle for less apparent, more serious problems.

Dollar vans may change ownership over the course of decades, and the mostly immigrant drivers are subject to police searches. Between 1994 and 2015, the TLC issued 418 van licenses, although the vast majority of vans are unlicensed. Licensed vans cannot pick up at New York City bus stops, and all pick-ups must be predetermined and all passengers logged. Additionally, in the 1980s and 1990s, the predominantly black and mostly immigrant dollar van drivers stated that they were harassed &quot;day and night&quot; by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), with some van drivers having their keys confiscated and thrown away by NYPD officers.

Over the course of the 2000s, surprise inspections in Hudson County, New Jersey have been imposed on jitney operators, whose lack of regulation, licensing or regular scheduling has been cited as the cause for numerous fines. A series of such inspections of the vans on Bergenline Avenue in June 2010 resulted in 285 citation violations, including problems involving brake lights, bald tires, steering wheels, suspensions, exhaust pipes, and emergency doors welded shut. An early July 2010 surprise inspection by the Hudson County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, which receives federal funding for regulating jitneys, found 23 out of 33 jitneys to be unsafe, which were taken out of service. Claims have also been made that jitneys cause congestion and undermine licensed bus service. Drivers of these vans have also developed a reputation for ignoring traffic laws in the course of competing for fares, picking up and dropping off passengers at random locations, and driving recklessly.

On July 30, 2013, an accident occurred at 56th Street and Boulevard East in West New York, New Jersey, in which Angelie Paredes, an 8-month-old North Bergen resident, was killed in her stroller when a full-sized jitney bus belonging to the New York-based Sphinx company toppled a light pole. The driver, Idowu Daramola of Queens, was arrested and charged with a number of offenses, including using a cell phone while driving. Officials also stated that he was speeding; however, this was later disputed by an investigator to the scene who concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the speed of the bus. At an August 6 press conference, legislators including U.S. Representative Albio Sires, New Jersey State Senator Nicholas Sacco, State Assembly members Vincent Prieto, Charles Mainor and Angelica Jimenez, West New York Mayor Felix Roque, Weehawken Mayor Richard Turner, Guttenberg Mayor Gerald Drasheff, Freeholder Junior Maldonado and Hudson County Sheriff Frank Schillari, noted that problems with jitneys existed since the 1980s, and called for stricter regulations for drivers and bus companies. This included increased monitoring and enforcement, and heightened participation by the public in identifying poor drivers, as jitneys had been exempt from regulations imposed on buses and other forms of transportation.

In February 2014, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed Angelie&#x27;s Law, strengthening regulations on commuter buses.

Several companies run vans in Northern New Jersey, often following similar routes to New Jersey Transit buses but at a slightly lower price and greater frequency. The most common routes have an eastern terminus on street level in Manhattan, either near the Port Authority Bus Terminal or the George Washington Bridge Bus Station. Often, several different companies ply the same route.

====Miami====
In Miami, jitneys (also known as the Miami Mini Bus) run through various neighborhoods, mostly those stretching between Downtown Miami to The Mall at 163rd Street in North Miami Beach, Florida. Miami has the country&#x27;s most comprehensive jitney network, due to Caribbean influence.

====San Francisco====
Jitneys ran in San Francisco from late 1914 to January 2016. In the 1910s, there were more than 1,400 jitneys operating in the city. However, by 2016, declining ridership combined with mounting penalties for traffic citations made the operations unprofitable.

====Houston====
The Houston Wave, Houston&#x27;s first jitney service in 17 years, operated between 2009 and 2019. It expanded into a network of buses operating within Loop 610 and to all special event venues in Houston.

===Latin America===
In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, “carros públicos” (literally &quot;public cars&quot;) are share taxis. Carros Publicos set routes with several passengers sharing the ride and others picked up throughout the journey.

In Puerto Rico the industry is regulated by the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission.

While these cars do travel inter-city, they may not be available for longer, cross-island travel. Stations may exist in cities, and Puerto Rican &quot;carros públicos&quot; may congregate in specific places around town.

===Mexico===

There are some areas in which traditional buses and minibuses cannot operate due to the size restrictions of the streets and overhanging objects. Some of these places are served by share taxis that are regulated by the state or city. The share taxis charge the standard minibuses fare. 

===Central and South America===
====Argentina====

&quot;Colectivos&quot; operated as share taxis from the late 1920s until the 1950s in Buenos Aires, Argentina when they were integrated into the public transportation system. Vehicles still known as &quot;colectivos&quot; operate throughout the country, but have long been indistinguishable from buses.

====Chile, Peru and Guatemala====

Often share taxi routes in Mexico are &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangements to fill in gaps in regular public transportation, and many operate inter-city as well as local routes. In many rural areas, they are the only public transportation.

In some cases, truck/taxi combination vehicles have evolved to transport light goods as well as passengers. Heavily used share taxi routes often evolve into regulated microbus public transit routes, as has occurred in Mexico City and in Lima.

&quot;Taxis colectivos&quot; are also found in Peru, Chile, Guatemala, and Argentina, where they are most commonly referred to simply as &quot;colectivos&quot;, although in some places they have become essentially standard buses.

<doc id="539057" wikidata="Q3352077" url="?curid=539057" title="Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968">
<text>The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (, codified at &quot;et seq.&quot;) was legislation passed by the Congress of the United States and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson that established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). Title III of the Act set rules for obtaining wiretap orders in the United States. The act was a major accomplishment of Johnson&#x27;s war on crime.

== Grants ==
The LEAA, which was superseded by the Office of Justice Programs, provided federal grant funding for criminology and criminal justice research, much of which focused on social aspects of crime. Research grants were also provided to develop alternative sanctions for punishment of young offenders. Block grants were provided to the states, with $100 million in funding. Within that amount, $50 million was earmarked for assistance to local law enforcement agencies, which included funds to deal with riot control and organized crime.

== Handguns ==
The Omnibus Crime Bill also prohibited interstate trade in handguns and increased the minimum age to 21 for buying handguns. This legislation was soon followed by the Gun Control Act of 1968, which set forth additional gun control restrictions.

On May 10, 2023, Senior District Judge Robert E. Payne of the Eastern District of Virginia declared the minimum age for handgun purchases to be unconstitutional.

On December 1, 2023, District Judge Thomas Kleeh of the Northern District of West Virginia also declared the minimum age requirement unconstitutional.

== Wiretaps ==
The wiretapping section of the bill was passed in part as a response to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions &quot;Berger v. New York&quot;, 388 U.S. 41 (1967) and &quot;Katz v. United States&quot;, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), which both limited the power of the government to obtain information from citizens without their consent, based on the protections under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In the &quot;Katz&quot; decision, the Court &quot;extended the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure to protect individuals with a &#x27;reasonable expectation of privacy.&#x27;&quot;

Section 2511(3) of the Crime Control Bill specifies that nothing in the act or the Federal Communications Act of 1934 shall limit the constitutional power of the President &quot;&quot;to take such measures as he deems necessary&quot;:
* &quot;to protect the nation against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a foreign power, to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the security of the United States or to protect national security information against foreign intelligence activities&quot;
* &quot;to protect the United States against the overthrow of the Government by force or other unlawful means, or against any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government&quot;&quot;

The section also limits use in evidence only where the interception was reasonable and prohibits disclosure except for purpose.

In 1975, the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, (known as the &quot;Church Committee&quot;) was established to investigate abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 1975 and 1976, the Church Committee published 14 reports on various U.S. intelligence agencies&#x27; operations, and a report on the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO program stated that &quot;the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches and seizures of conversations and protected all conversations of an individual as to which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy...At no time, however, were the Justice Department&#x27;s standards and procedures ever applied to NSA&#x27;s electronic monitoring system and its &#x27;watch listing&#x27; of American citizens. From the early 1960s until 1973, NSA compiled a list of individuals and organizations, including 1200 American citizens and domestic groups, whose communications were segregated from the mass of communications intercepted by the Agency, transcribed, and frequently disseminated to other agencies for intelligence purposes&quot;.

Academic Colin Agur argues that the act &quot;disappoints&quot; from the perspective of Brandeisian legal philosophy, in regards to individual privacy, because it assumes that law enforcement agencies have a right to electronic surveillance, instead of &quot;giving unambiguous priority to individual privacy.&quot;

===Employee privacy===
The Act prohibits &quot;employers from listening to the private telephone conversations of employees or disclosing the contents of these conversations.&quot; Employers can ban personal phone calls and can monitor calls for compliance provided they stop listening as soon as a personal conversation begins. Violations carry fines up to $10,000. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 expanded these protections to electronic and cell phone communication. &quot;See also Employee monitoring and Workplace privacy&quot;.

==FBI expansion==
The bill increased the FBI budget by 10% to fund police training at the FBI National Academy. Much of this training was for riot control, a popular political issue at the time.

== Miranda warning ==
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (384 U.S. 436) created the requirement that a citizen must be informed of their legal rights upon their arrest and before they are interrogated, which came to be known as Miranda warnings. Responding to various complaints that such warnings allowed too many criminals go free, Congress, in provisions codified under 18 U.S.C. § 3501 with a clear intent to reverse the effect of the court ruling, included a provision in the Crime Control Act directing federal trial judges to admit statements of criminal defendants if they were made voluntarily, without regard to whether he had received the Miranda warnings.

The stated criteria for voluntary statements depended on such things as:
:(1) the time between arrest and arraignment;
:(2) whether the defendant knew the crime for which he had been arrested;
:(3) whether he had been told that he did not have to talk to the police and that any statement could be used against him;
:(4) whether the defendant knew prior to questioning that he had the right to the assistance of counsel; and,
:(5) whether he actually had the assistance of counsel during questioning.

It also provided that the &quot;presence or absence of any of&quot; the factors &quot;need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntariness of the confession.&quot; (As a federal statute, it applied only to criminal proceedings either under federal laws, or in the District of Columbia.)

That provision was disallowed in 1968 by a federal appeals court decision that was not appealed, and it escaped Supreme Court review until 32 years after passage, in &quot;Dickerson v. United States&quot; (2000). A lower court of the Fourth Circuit had reasoned that Miranda was not a constitutional requirement, that Congress could therefore overrule it by legislation, and that the provision in the Omnibus Crime Control Act had supplanted the requirement that police give Miranda warnings. The Supreme Court overturned the Fourth Circuit decision, reaffirming the ruling of Miranda v. Arizona (1966) as the primary guideline for the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation, and stating that Congress does not have the legislative power to supersede Miranda v. Arizona.

<doc id="539058" wikidata="Q1189595" url="?curid=539058" title="Dennis Wheatley">
<text>Dennis Yates Wheatley (8 January 1897 – 10 November 1977) was a British writer whose prolific output of thrillers and occult novels made him one of the world&#x27;s best-selling authors from the 1930s through to the 1960s.

==Early life==
Wheatley was born at 10, Raleigh Gardens, Brixton Hill, London, the eldest of three children--and only son--of Albert David Wheatley (died 1927) and Florence Elizabeth Harriet (1874-1955), daughter of ironmaster William Yates Baker, of Aspen House, 219, Brixton Hill. Wheatley&#x27;s father owned Wheatley &amp; Son, a wine business in Mayfair, London. Dennis admitted to having little aptitude for schooling and was later expelled after a few &quot;unhappy years&quot; studying at Dulwich College for allegedly forming a &quot;secret society&quot;, as he mentions in his introduction to &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;. Soon after his expulsion, Wheatley became a British Merchant Navy officer cadet on the training ship HMS &quot;Worcester&quot;.

==Military service==
Wheatley was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant into the Royal Field Artillery during the First World War, receiving his basic training at Biscot Camp in Luton. He was assigned to the City of London Brigade and the 36th (Ulster) Division. Dennis was gassed in a chlorine attack during Passchendaele and was invalided out, having served in Flanders, on the Ypres Salient, and in France at Cambrai and Saint-Quentin.

In 1919 he took over management of the family&#x27;s wine business. In 1931, however, after his father&#x27;s death, and with business having declined because of the Great Depression, he sold the firm and began writing. In 1930, his widowed mother married Sir Louis Newton, 1st Baronet, Lord Mayor of London 1923–24.

During the Second World War Wheatley was a member of the London Controlling Section, which secretly coordinated strategic military deception and cover plans. His literary talents led to his working with planning staffs for the War Office. He wrote numerous papers for them, including suggestions for dealing with a possible Nazi invasion of Britain (recounted in his works &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Deception Planners&quot;). The most famous of his submissions to the Joint Planning Staff of the war cabinet was on &quot;Total War&quot;. He received a direct commission in the JP Service as a Wing Commander, RAFVR, and took part in the plans for the Normandy invasions. After the war Wheatley was awarded the U.S. Bronze Star for his role in the Second World War.

==Writing career==
Wheatley&#x27;s first book, &quot;Three Inquisitive People&quot;, was not published when completed, but came out later, in 1940. However, his next novel made quite a splash. Called &quot;The Forbidden Territory&quot;, it was an immediate success when issued by Hutchinson in 1933, being reprinted seven times in seven weeks. After finishing &quot;The Fabulous Valley&quot;, Wheatley decided to use the theme of black magic for his next book. He wrote: &quot;The fact that I had read extensively about ancient religions gave me some useful background, but I required up-to-date information about occult circles in this country. My friend, Tom Driberg, who then lived in a mews flat just behind us in Queen&#x27;s Gate, proved most helpful. He introduced me to Aleister Crowley, the Reverend Montague Summers and Rollo Ahmed.&quot; The release the next year of his occult story, &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;—hailed by James Hilton as &quot;the best thing of its kind since &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;—cemented his reputation as &quot;The Prince of Thriller Writers.&quot;

Wheatley mainly wrote adventure novels, with many books in a series of linked works. Background themes included the French Revolution (the &quot;Roger Brook&quot; series), Satanism (the &quot;Duke de Richleau&quot; series), World War II (the &quot;Gregory Sallust&quot; series) and espionage (the &quot;Julian Day&quot; novels). Over time, each of his major series would include at least one book pitting the hero against some manifestation of the supernatural—making them into fantasy and specifically contemporary fantasy. He came to be considered an authority on Satanism, the practice of exorcism, and black magic, toward all of which he expressed hostility. During his study of the paranormal, though, he joined the Ghost Club.

In many of his works, Wheatley wove in interactions between his characters and actual historical events and individuals. For example, in the &quot;Roger Brook&quot; series the main character involves himself with Napoleon and Joséphine whilst spying for Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Similarly, in the &quot;Gregory Sallust&quot; series, Sallust shares an evening meal with Hermann Göring. In &quot;They Used Dark Forces&quot;, the last book of the Sallust war-time sequence, Göring gets a surprisingly positive depiction as an honourable man who disliked the systematic killing of the Jews (though not actually doing anything to stop it) and who wanted to end the war when realizing that Germany was doomed to lose it; Göring is contrasted with Goebbels, who according to Wheatley &quot;was on the extreme left&quot; and &quot;took seriously the Socialist part of National Socialism&quot;.

During the 1930s, Wheatley conceived a series of mysteries, presented as case files, including testimonies, letters, and pieces of evidence such as hairs or pills. The reader had to inspect this evidence to solve the mystery before unsealing the last pages of the file, which gave the answer. Four of these &#x27;Crime Dossiers&#x27; were published: &quot;Murder Off Miami&quot;, &quot;Who Killed Robert Prentice?&quot;, &quot;The Malinsay Massacre&quot;, and &quot;Herewith The Clues!&quot;.

Wheatley also devised a number of board games including &quot;Invasion&quot; (1938), &quot;Blockade&quot; (1939), and &quot;Alibi&quot; (April 1953).

In the 1960s, Hutchinson was selling a million copies of his books per year, and most of his titles were kept available in hardcover. A few of his books were made into films by Hammer, of which the best known is &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot; (book 1934, film 1968). Wheatley also wrote non-fiction works, including an account of the Russian Revolution, a life of King Charles II of England, and several autobiographical volumes.

He edited several collections of short stories, and from 1974 to 1977 he supervised a series of 45 paperback reprints for the British publisher Sphere with the heading &quot;The Dennis Wheatley Library of the Occult&quot;, selecting the titles and writing short introductions for each book. These included both occult-themed novels by the likes of Bram Stoker and Aleister Crowley (with whom he once shared a lunch) and non-fiction works on magic, occultism, and divination by authors such as the Theosophist H. P. Blavatsky, the historian Maurice Magre, the magician Isaac Bonewits, and the palm-reader Cheiro.

Two weeks before his death in November 1977, Wheatley received conditional absolution from his old friend Cyril &#x27;Bobby&#x27; Eastaugh, the Bishop of Peterborough. He was cremated at Tooting and his ashes interred at the South Cemetery section of Brookwood Cemetery, under a tall tree near the entrance. He is also commemorated on the Baker/Yates family monument at West Norwood Cemetery.

His estate library was sold in a catalogue sale by Basil Blackwell&#x27;s in 1979. It suggested a well-read individual with wide-ranging interests, particularly with respect to historical fiction and Europe.

His grandson Dominic Wheatley became one of the co-founders of the software house Domark, which published a number of titles in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Politics==
Wheatley&#x27;s work reflects his conservative worldview. His protagonists are generally supporters of the monarchy, the British Empire and the class system, and many of his villains are villainous because they attack these ideas. Wheatley was an opponent of Nazism and Communism, believing them to be controlled by Satanic power.

===&quot;Letter to Posterity&quot;===
During the winter of 1947, Wheatley penned &#x27;A Letter to Posterity&#x27; and buried it in an urn at his country home. The letter was intended to be discovered some time in the future (it was found in 1969, when the house was demolished for redevelopment of the property). He predicted in it that the socialist reforms, which were introduced by the post-war government, would result inevitably in the abolition of the monarchy, the &quot;pampering&quot; of a &quot;lazy&quot; working class and a national bankruptcy. He advised both passive and active resistance to the resulting &quot;tyranny&quot;, including &quot;ambushing and killing of unjust tyrannous officials&quot;.
Employers are now no longer allowed to run their businesses as they think best but have become the bond slaves of socialist state planning. The school leaving age has been put up to 16, and a 5 day working week has been instituted in the mines, the railways and many other industries.

The doctrine of ensuring every child a good start in life and equal opportunities is fair and right, but the intelligent and the hardworking will always rise above the rest, and it is not a practical proposition that the few should be expected to devote their lives exclusively to making things easy for the majority. In time, such a system is bound to undermine the vigour of the race.

==Posthumous publication==
From 1972 to 1977 (the year of his death), 52 of Wheatley&#x27;s novels were offered in a uniform hardcover set by Heron Books UK. (This was in addition to Hutchinson&#x27;s own &quot;Lymington&quot; library edition, published from 1961 to 1979.) Having brought each of his major fictional series to a close with the final Roger Brook novel, Wheatley then turned to his memoirs. These were announced as five volumes, but were eventually only published as three books, the (fourth) volume concerning the Second World War issued as a separate title. His availability and influence declined following his death, partly owing to difficulties of reprinting his works because of copyright problems.

In 1998 Justerini &amp; Brooks celebrated their upcoming 250th anniversary by revising his last work about their house, &quot;The Eight Ages of Justerini&#x27;s&quot; (1965) and re-issuing it as &quot;The Nine Ages of Justerini&#x27;s&quot;. The revision by Susan Keevil brought the history up to date.

Wheatley&#x27;s literary estate was acquired by media company Chorion in April 2008, and several titles were reissued in Wordsworth paperback editions. A new hardcover omnibus of Black Magic novels was released by Prion in 2011.

When Chorion encountered financial problems in 2012, the Rights House and PFD acquired four crime estates from them, including the Wheatley titles. PFD hoped to broker new series for TV and radio, and a move to digital publishing.

In October 2013, Bloomsbury Reader began republishing 56 of his titles; many of these will be edited and abridged. However, many of them will also have new introductions evaluating Wheatley&#x27;s work, including some written by his grandson, Dominic Wheatley. These are to be available in both printed format and as ebooks.

==In fiction==
In Stephen Volk&#x27;s novella &quot;Netherwood&quot;, part of Volk&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;The Dark Masters Trilogy&quot;, set in 1947, a fictional version of Wheatley is involved in black magic by Aleister Crowley.

<doc id="539061" wikidata="Q7404032" url="?curid=539061" title="Salem Academy">
<text>Salem Academy is a boarding and day school for high school girls in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It shares its campus with Salem College, located near historic Old Salem. It is the oldest private school in North Carolina, and the fourth-oldest boarding school in the United States.

==History==
Salem was founded in 1772 by early Moravian settlers who held the view that girls deserved an education comparable to that afforded boys. Among the town&#x27;s early residents were 16 girls and women who traveled, mostly on foot, around 500 miles from Bethlehem, Province of Pennsylvania, to join the new community. One of them was 17-year-old Elisabeth Oesterlein, who founded and became the first teacher of what is now Salem Academy and College. There were very few girls&#x27; schools at the time, particularly in the South. Word quickly spread about the girls&#x27; school, and the school accepted boarding students in 1802. The school grew considerably throughout the 19th century, both in size and course offerings, with college-level courses being offered in the 1860s. As the college-level curriculum expanded, the school officially became known as Salem Academy and College in 1907. Despite such travails as the American Civil War and a measles epidemic in the 1800s, the Academy has never closed its doors in the more than two centuries since those first classes were held.

==Affiliation==
Founded by the Moravian Church, Salem Academy is now an independent institution which retains some of the traditions of the church. Other Moravian traditions still practiced at the school include the senior vespers, held at the end of every fall term, which includes a Moravian Lovefeast.

Salem Academy is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools and is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Admissions==
Salem accepts students from all over the United States and from around the world. All U.S. applicants are required to send middle-school transcripts and teacher recommendations, and must take the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT). International applicants may submit TOEFL or TOEFL, Jr. scores as an alternate to the SSAT. Applicants are also required to undergo an interview before being admitted.

International students from countries such as Germany, South Korea, Trinidad, Albania, Dominica, Lithuania, the United Kingdom, the Bahamas, and China make up nearly one-quarter of the student body each school year.

==Academics==
Salem Academy offers a college preparatory curriculum, and 100 percent of Salem Academy students continue their education in college. Students are accepted at many of the top colleges and universities in the United States and around the world.

The Class of 2017 had a 100 percent college acceptance rate and earned more than $3 million in scholarship offers. Recent graduates have enrolled at top colleges and universities, including Duke University; the University of Southern California; the University of California, Los Angeles; Pennsylvania State University; Washington University in St. Louis; UNC Chapel Hill; Williams College; NYU Tisch School of the Arts; and Salem College.

===Requirements===
Salem requires 20 academic credits required for graduation, including four in English, three in a world language, four in mathematics, three in history, and three in science, plus requirements in physical education, religion, and fine arts.

===Jan Term===
Jan Term is a three-week mini-term that gives students opportunities to pursue internships, enroll in special classes, and travel both in the United States and abroad. The school schedules trips each year that are organized and led by faculty members from different departments. For the first two years most students spend January Term on campus in focused classes or programs that allow each student to further explore her interests. Juniors and Seniors pursue internships outside of Salem where they can gain first hand knowledge of topics and careers of interest.

==Athletics==

===Teams===
Salem Academy&#x27;s students participate in many different sports alongside their academic activities.

During the fall season, the offered sports include: varsity and junior-varsity: field hockey, volleyball, tennis, and cross country.

In the winter season, varsity swimming, basketball, and fencing are offered.

And in the spring, varsity soccer, and varsity track and field are the offered sports.

The school mascot is the saber, and the school colors are purple and gold.

===Athletic events===

In February, the Athletic Council holds a bonfire where students gather around a large fire on the athletic fields to roast hotdogs, make smores, and drink hot chocolate.

==Traditions==
===Opening Chapel===
Each fall the school year officially begins at Opening Chapel. The ceremony involves faculty and staff sharing personal messages and the Dean of Students reading letters from alumnae with well wishes and advice for current students. Alumnae from classes as far back as 1930 attend and are recognized by the current students.

===Smoosh Cake Banquet===

Smoosh Cake Banquet is a tradition for Salem Academy. Seniors are each given a cupcake. Inside each cupcake are small gems that &quot;foretell&quot; that student&#x27;s future.

===Athletic Picnic===
The school colors are purple and gold and the entire school is divided into two school spirit teams—the purple team and the gold team. Each year the new students learn which team they will be on at the Athletic Picnic, held in the fall. The athletic picnic includes games and displays of school spirit on the front lawn.

===Ring Banquet===
Ring banquet is held in the fall. Freshman host an evening with a secret theme that only they know. This is when seniors run down an aisle to receive their class rings. The presidents of both the Freshman and Senior classes, along with a previously elected Freshman prepare speeches and speak to the crowd.

===Senior Day===
Senior Day is held the day after the Ring Banquet. In the morning, the seniors are entertained by the faculty and staff at a special breakfast. During the day the seniors, divided in groups, teach brief seminars to the younger students on the topic of their choice, ranging from origami to cupcake decorating to the philosophy of &quot;The Office.&quot; The morning is concluded by the seniors acting out skits and singing the senior song to the other students, faculty, and staff during an outdoor luncheon. Starting with the Class of 2008, if the seniors wish to mention a teacher in the skit, they must ask for the approval of the mentioned teacher, due to past incidents of faculty members feeling insulted by the content of the skits. Senior skits portray what their four years were like, highlight ongoing inside class jokes, and remember the most absurd events their class experienced together.

===Senior Vespers===
Senior Vespers is a cherished Christmas event that marks the close of the fall semester. The seniors lead a Moravian Lovefeast, which is a candlelight choral service in which students sing Christmas carols and seniors serve coffee and buns in the Moravian tradition. Seniors wear white dresses and are not allowed to speak for the duration of the ceremony

<doc id="539065" wikidata="Q2468132" url="?curid=539065" title="Gallantry Cross (South Vietnam)">
<text>The Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross also known as the Vietnamese Gallantry Cross or Vietnam Cross of Gallantry () is a military decoration of the former Government of South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam). The medal was created on August 15, 1950, and was awarded to military personnel, civilians, and Armed Forces units and organizations in recognition of deeds of valor or heroic conduct while in combat with the enemy.

Individuals who received the medal, ribbon, and a citation were personally cited at the Armed Forces, Corps, Division, Brigade or Regiment level. The Republic of Vietnam authorized members of units and organizations that were cited, to wear the Gallantry Cross Unit Citation Emblem with Palm and Frame (no medal was authorized).

==Medal==
The medal is gold in color, and 35 mm wide. It consists of a Celtic cross with two crossed swords between the arms. The cross is superimposed over a wreath. The center of the cross contains a disc with the outline of the country of Vietnam between two palm branches joined at the bottom. A scroll is on top of the map and is inscribed &quot;QUOC-GIA LAO-TUONG&quot; (Reward of the State).

The suspension ribbon of the medal is 35 mm wide and is made up of the following stripes: 9 mm of Old Glory Red; 17 mm center stripe in Golden Yellow. The center stripe has sixteen strands of Old Glory Red; and 9 mm of Old Glory Red.

===Degrees===
The Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross was awarded in four degrees, with a basic medal followed by higher degrees which were the equivalent of personal citations on an organizational level (also known as having been &quot;mentioned in dispatches&quot;). The degrees of the Gallantry Cross are as follows:
* Gallantry Cross with Palm: cited at the Armed Forces level
* Gallantry Cross with Gold Star: cited at the Corps level
* Gallantry Cross with Silver Star: cited at the Division level
* Gallantry Cross with Bronze Star: cited at the Regiment or Brigade level

===Ribbon devices===
The devices to the Gallantry Cross are not worn simultaneously but instead are upgraded to the next higher device which would replace the previous device for wear on the decoration.

U.S. Marine Corps uniform regulations in 2003 state the recipient should wear only one Gallantry Cross award (medal or ribbon bar) regardless of the number received. For multiple awards, wear as many authorized devices as will fit on one medal suspension ribbon or ribbon bar. Wear the devices for subsequent awards in order of seniority from the wearer&#x27;s right. The first palm is inches on the suspension ribbon or inch on the service ribbon. Subsequent palms are inch on the suspension ribbon or inch on the service ribbon. Stars are inch.

===Service versions===
The Gallantry Cross was awarded to members of all military branches, as well as service members of foreign and allied militaries. The similarly named decorations were the Air Gallantry Cross and Navy Gallantry Cross. These decorations were awarded under a different authority, with different criteria, and were considered separate decorations.

==Unit award==
The Unit Citation Emblem of the colors of the Gallantry Cross is awarded to personnel in the South Vietnamese military and Allied military units that have been cited and presented a decoration which is prescribed to be awarded on a collective basis.

Known as the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm (Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm and Frame Unit Citation), the Unit Citation Emblem in the colors of the Gallantry Cross with Palm, was created on January 20, 1968, and was issued with the Gallantry Cross ribbon bar with a by inch bronze palm and a gold frame. The former South Vietnamese military awarded the Gallantry Cross to specific military units that distinguished themselves to the same level as would be required for the individual award. Regulations for the issuance of the Vietnam Gallantry Cross permit the wearing of both the individual and unit award simultaneously since both are considered separate awards. The Gallantry Cross was awarded to every Allied nation which provided support to South Vietnam. The Gallantry Cross became the most commonly awarded Vietnamese decoration to foreigners, second only to the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

===Fourragere===
The South Vietnamese military Fourragere in the colors of the Gallantry Cross represented a military unit cited two times. It was a brilliant golden-yellow, with red intermixed. Department of the Army message 111030Z from April 1974, established the policy that only one emblem for a unit award was authorized to be worn at a time. This change resulted in the fourragere being no longer authorized for wear, as it was representative of multiple awards.

===U.S. authorization===
&quot;Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation&quot;:

U.S. Department of Defense:&lt;br&gt;
U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) and its subordinate units, 8 Feb 1962 to 28 Mar 1973&lt;br&gt;
U.S. Army and its subordinate units, 20 July 1965 to 28 Mar 1973&lt;br&gt;
This permits all personnel who served in Vietnam to wear the RVN Gallantry Cross unit citation.

&quot;Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation (Gallantry Cross color with Palm and Frame); RVN Meritorious Unit Citation (Gallantry Cross)&quot;

U.S. Navy and Marine Corps: In addition to specific ships/units, all personnel who served &quot;in country&quot; Vietnam, 8 February 1962 to 28 March 1973.

==United States acceptance==
The United States military began authorizing the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross in March 1968 with retroactive presentation of the decoration to 1961. In 1974, Army General Order Number 8 confirmed eligibility for the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm and Frame Unit Citation to every military unit of the United States Army which had served under the Military Assistance Command from 1961 to 1974, however, orders, specific as to dates and units, do exist for specific Army commands as well as for members of other services not affected by the Army General Order.

===Award requests===
The National Personnel Records Center-NPRC (or veteran&#x27;s service branch), is the U.S. federal agency that generally takes and responds to retroactive award requests from U.S. Army veterans (and other Vietnam veterans) and or updating their personal military records to show the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross (RVN) and or unit award credit, either per Army General Order 8 or per unit specific awards. The full medal and or unit citation award are both considered foreign military awards and are not issued to Vietnam veterans (or their next of kin) by the NPRC (or any of the United States military services). Once requested (USN-USMC name of the unit award must be used by those veterans) and authorized, the veteran (or next of kin) will be notified by mail to purchase the award(s) at most U.S. military installations, military clothing sales or private military insignia and Internet dealers.

<text>Old Master Q (; Wong&#x27;s romanization: Lo Fu Gee; also known as Mr. Funnybone from the movie of the same name) is a Hong Kong manhua created by Alfonso Wong. The cartoon first appeared in the newspapers and magazines in Hong Kong on 3 February 1962, and later serialised in 1964. The comic is still in publication today, and is the oldest Asian comic series in publication.

The comic is copyrighted by WangZ Inc, a company established by Joseph Wong Chak (Alfonso Wong&#x27;s eldest son) in Taipei, Taiwan. Joseph Wong still continues to create new volumes and has taken over the story or volume creations since 1995.

==Name==
Alfonso Wong explained that (&quot;Lo&quot;) means &quot;old&quot;, is &quot;a rather ordinary, but respectable title&quot; over two-thousand-year old which denotes a &quot;learned one&quot; &quot;who can become a teacher (&#x27;Fu Gee&#x27;) or, or one who has studied a lot&quot;; the English title &quot;Old Master Q&quot; &quot;sort of&quot; translates the Chinese title, with Q being abbreviated from earlier &quot;Cute&quot;. Wong additionally noted the similarity between his main character&#x27;s English title &quot;Old Master Q&quot; &amp; the name Ah Q of Lu Xun&#x27;s character, whom Wong considered to be &quot;rather and satirical&quot;.

==Characters==
The series&#x27; cast is led by Old Master Q (), an elderly, lanky man dressed in a distinctive traditional Chinese attire. The character is created to satirise Asian cultures in particularly backward conservatism, hubris, showing-off attitude, ingratitude, rashness, irresponsibility, weak-will, and even delusion. Most of the time, he is depicted as a person who keeps living in the past in the ever-changing and brutally unfair world where money is the absolute power. To highlight this, Q is depicted in many short stories to mostly get his rewards for being a good person in the form of being backstabbed; wrongfully accused of wrongdoings as well as being hated for no apparent reason.

Kelvin Chan of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; described Q as &quot;eccentric&quot;.

Supporting characters include: 
*Big Potato () Old Master Q&#x27;s identically dressed friend with a stumpy, big-headed build. 
*Mr. Chin (), an &#x27;ordinary Joe&#x27; character, and good friends with Old Master Q and Potato. 
*Miss Chan (), Old Master Q&#x27;s love interest. Vain and gold-digging, she always sees herself as the most beautiful woman alive and has a tendency to ditch Q every time she gets her hands on some rich individual. 
*Mr. Chiu (), main antagonist to Old Master Q, often pranking each other. He is often depicted as an arrogant rich individual who looks down on people, as well as being incredibly petty.

==Format and themes==
The overall theme of the comics centres on humour: with characters usually portrayed in a variety of social statuses, professions and time periods; ranging from beggars and office workers to actors and ancient warriors; which allows for a wide variety of scenarios to explore. More outlandish situations incorporate surrealism, close encounters with aliens, ghost sightings, and the afterlife. While each comic is typically produced as short strips of four, six or twelve panels, longer comics have been produced revolving around lengthier adventures of the main cast pitted against gangsters in modern Hong Kong or warriors in a wuxia setting.

While Old Master Q comics primarily focus on humour, they also reflect changing social trends; particularly from the 1960s to the 1980s. The comics would sometimes feature societal problems in urban life, such as poverty, petty thefts and secret societies. It also poked fun at fashion, contemporary art and rock music. The comic strips sometimes also bemoan the decline of ethical or moral values in modern-day living. Characters often display acts of selfishness or misery; although the comics occasionally display good values like filial piety. The language barrier between the Chinese language and the English language is also depicted in some comic strips; illustrated with Old Master Q&#x27;s difficulty communicating with foreigners, especially Westerners.

The comics have, on some occasions, expressed complexity in the plots and serious views on major political changes taking place in Hong Kong during the 1960s-1980s. It had previously criticised overly Westernised Chinese, who were often shown in the comic strips kowtowing to Western interests over the local Chinese interests. The run-up to the handover of Hong Kong to China following the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 also became a point of interest, as a few comic strips were published through the late 1980s and early 1990s expressing the characters&#x27; fears of handover, frequently represented in a numeral of the year it would take place: 1997. Some of these comic strips also depict direct assault of representations of the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, occasionally in the form of caricatured depictions of Deng Xiaoping. The handover was later depicted in more a positive light in the years leading to the actual event; possibly representing a changing perspective from the author.

==Films==
The comic series was made into many Cantonese and Mandarin cartoon animations, one of which combined live actors and advanced CGI graphics.

The list of Old Master Q films is as follows, in chronological order:

* Other actors in OMQ movies include: Hong Wei (紅薇), Connie Chan, Nancy Sit, Chu Yau-ko (朱由高), Fen Ni (芬妮)
* Other lyricists/singers include: Wong Jim, Joseph Koo, Leslie Cheung

==Spin-off==
A spin-off series called &quot;Q Master Q&quot; (Q夫子) shows young versions of the characters with similar clothing as their adult counterparts. Each of their names also are related to their counterparts:

== Plagiarism dispute ==

Some cartoonists and readers claim that the idea of Old Master Q was actually created by Peng Di (朋弟) in the late 1930s and not Alfonso Wong, as some of whom were mostly professional Mainland cartoonists alleged that Peng Di&#x27;s ideas were stolen by Alfonso Wong. They claimed that the cartoons first appeared in the newspapers and magazines in Beijing (Peking) and Tianjin (Tientsin). The character created by Peng Di was claimed to slightly resemble Old Master Q which is currently being copyrighted by OMQ ZMedia Ltd. The character by Peng Di wore similar clothing and had a little similarity in personality to that of Old Master Q. However, the formats, themes, and contents of the stories were different as Old Master Q was not heavy with dialogue making it easy for foreigners around the world to immerse themselves in the story.

Feng Jicai published a book in 2001 containing samples of work by Peng Di, which displayed the similarities between Peng Di and Alfonso Wong&#x27;s works. The result of this dispute remains unclear as WangZ Inc. has denied all plagiarism accusations.

<text>The Opéra National de Lyon (), marketed as Opéra de Lyon during the last decade, is an opera company in Lyon, based and performing mostly at the Opéra Nouvel, an 1831 theater that was modernized and architecturally transformed in 1993.
==History==
The inaugural performance of François-Adrien Boïeldieu&#x27;s &quot;La Dame blanche&quot; was given on 1 July 1831. The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries saw some significant French premieres of major operas including Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; in 1896, Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; in the following year, and Moussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in 1913. In addition, many world premieres such as Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erwartung&quot; (1967) have been presented.

In the years after the 1969 appointment of Louis Erlo as general director, many innovative productions and premieres of both French operas and Twentieth Century operas have been staged. Two significant French artists who have been associated with the Opéra in recent years are the stage director, Laurent Pelly, and the soprano, Natalie Dessay.
==Conductors==
Past principal conductors at the company have included André Cluytens, John Eliot Gardiner, Kent Nagano, Louis Langrée, Iván Fischer, and Kazushi Ono. Since the start of the 2017–2018 season, the company&#x27;s current principal conductor (&quot;chef permanent&quot;) of the company is Daniele Rustioni, whose appointment to the post was announced in March 2015. The current choirmaster of the company is Philip White, since 2015.
==Affiliated companies and status==
The company has an affiliated &quot;corps de ballet&quot;, Lyon Opera Ballet. As well, the company has a children&#x27;s choir, &quot;La Maîtrise&quot; (masterclass), was created in 1990 to form a top-level choir of young soloists. Since 1993, it has a status similar to other French musical schools.

==The opera house==
A first theater was built here by Soufflot during the 18th century. Nevertheless, the theatre soon became too small and the architects Chenavard and Pollet rebuilt a brand new one in a neo-classical style in 1830.

At the beginning of the 1980s, out of age and not meeting the needs any more, the Opera had to be renewed. A competition for architects was thus launched and won in 1986 by Jean Nouvel. The new Opera of Lyon was inaugurated in May 1993 and is now part of the international architectural heritage.

Outside the opera house, Nouvel only kept the outer walls. He also dug new underground levels and added a semi-cylindrical dome that is used by dancers.
On the opera house front wall, 8 muses have been kept in place (Uranie, the 9th one was removed to respect the symmetry of the building).

==Principal conductors==
* John Eliot Gardiner (1983–1988)
* Kent Nagano (1988–1998)
* Louis Langrée (1998–2000)
* Iván Fischer (2000–2003)
* Kazushi Ono (2008–2017)
* Daniele Rustioni (2017–present)

== Awards ==
The opera received the &quot;Opera Company of the Year&quot; award at the 2017 International Opera Awards.

<doc id="539074" wikidata="Q310590" url="?curid=539074" title="Georges Dumézil">
<text>Georges Edmond Raoul Dumézil (4 March 189811 October 1986) was a French philologist, linguist, and religious studies scholar who specialized in comparative linguistics and mythology. He was a professor at Istanbul University, École pratique des hautes études and the Collège de France, and a member of the Académie Française. Dumézil is well known for his formulation of the trifunctional hypothesis on Proto-Indo-European mythology and society. His research has had a major influence on the fields of comparative mythology and Indo-European studies.

==Early life and education==
Georges Dumézil was born in Paris, France, on 4 March 1898, the son of Jean Anatole Jean Dumézil and Marguerite Dutier. His father was a highly educated general in the French Army.

Dumézil received an elite education in Paris at the Collège de Neufchâteau, Lycée de Troyes, Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Lycée de Tarbes. He came to master Ancient Greek and Latin at an early age. Through the influence of Michel Bréal, who was a student of Franz Bopp and the grandfather of one of Dumézil&#x27;s friends, Dumézil came to master Sanskrit, and developed a strong interest in Indo-European mythology and religion. He began studying at École normale supérieure (ENS) in 1916. During World War I, Dumézil served as an artillery officer in the French Army, for which he received the Croix de Guerre. His father was inspector-general of the French artillery corps during the war.

Dumézil returned to his studies at ENS in 1919. His most important teacher there was Antoine Meillet, who gave him a rigorous introduction in Iranian and Indo-European linguistics. Meillet was to have a great influence on Dumézil. Unlike other students of Meillet, Dumézil was more interested in mythology than linguistics. In the 19th century, philologists such as Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn, Max Müller and Elard Hugo Meyer (who had influenced Bréal) had conducted notable work on comparative mythology, but their theories had since been found to be mostly untenable. Dumézil became determined to restore the field of comparative mythology from its contemporary discredit.

Dumézil lectured at Lycee de Beauvais in 1920, and taught French at the University of Warsaw in 1920–1921. While lecturing at Warsaw, Dumézil was struck by striking similarities between Sanskrit literature and the works of Ovid, which suggested to him that these pieces of literature contained traces of a common Indo-European heritage.

Dumézil gained his PhD in comparative religion in 1924 with the thesis &quot;Le festin d&#x27;immortalité&quot;. Inspired by the works of Ernst Kuhn, the thesis examined ritual drinks in Indo-Iranian, Germanic, Celtic, Slavic and Italic religion. Dumézil&#x27;s early writings were also inspired by the research of James George Frazer, whose views were however becoming discredited due to advances in the field of anthropology. At ENS, Dumézil became a close friend of Pierre Gaxotte. Gaxotte was a follower of Charles Maurras, leader of the nationalist Action Française movement. Though some have accused Dumézil of being in sympathy with Action Française, Dumézil has denied this, and was never a member of the organization.

Dumézil&#x27;s PhD thesis was highly praised by Meillet, who requested Marcel Mauss and Henri Hubert, both followers of Émile Durkheim, to assist Dumézil with further studies. For reasons unknown, the request was turned down. Mauss and Hubert were both socialists in the spirit of Jean Jaurès, who actively used their academic influence to advance their own political ideology. Hubert in particular was a fervent Dreyfusard known for his philosemitism, republicanism, anti-racism and Germanophobia. Dumézil had deliberately avoided attending Hubert&#x27;s lectures, and had to be convinced by Meillet to provide Hubert with a copy of his PhD thesis, which Hubert subsequently bitterly criticized. The refusal of Mauss and Hubert to provide Dumézil with a position may have been motivated by suspicions that Dumézil did not agree with them politically. The rejection by Hubert led to Dumézil losing support from Meillet as well. Meilett informed Dumézil that it would be impossible for him to acquire a position in France, and encouraged him to move abroad.

==Early career==

From 1925 to 1931, Dumézil was Professor of the History of Religions at Istanbul University. During his years in Istanbul, Dumézil acquired proficiency in Armenian and Ossetian, and many non-Indo-European languages of the Caucasus. This enabled him to study the Nart saga, on which he published a number of influential monographs. Dumézil developed a strong interest in the Ossetians and their mythology, which was to prove indispensable for his future research. For the rest of his life, Dumézil would make yearly visits to Istanbul to conduct field research among Ossetians in Turkey. During this time he also published his &quot;Le problème des centaures&quot; (1929), which examined similarities in Greek and Indo-Iranian. It was inspired by Elard Hugo Meyer. Together with &quot;Le festin d&#x27;immortalité&quot; (1924) and &quot;Le crime des Lemniennes&quot; (1924), &quot;Le problème des centaures&quot; would form part of the works Dumézil referred to as his &quot;Ambrosia cycle&quot;.

Dumézil&#x27;s work in Istanbul would be of enormous importance to his future research, and he would later consider his years in Istanbul as the happiest of his life. In 1930, Dumézil published his important &quot;La préhistoire indo-iranienne des castes&quot;. Drawing upon evidence from Avestan, Persian, Greek, Ossetian and Arabic sources, Dumézil suggested that ancient Indo-Iranians, including the Scythians, maintained a caste system which had been established before the Indo-Iranian migrations into South Asia. This article eventually caught the attention of French linguist Émile Benveniste, with whom Dumézil entered a fruitful correspondence.

From 1931 to 1933, Dumézil taught French at Uppsala University. Here he became acquainted with the influential professor Henrik Samuel Nyberg and the latter&#x27;s favourite students, Stig Wikander and Geo Widengren. Through Wikander and Widengren, Dumézil further became acquainted with Otto Höfler. Wikander, Widengren and Höfler would remain lifelong friends and intellectual collaborators of Dumézil. Throughout their careers, these scholars would have a strong influence on each other&#x27;s research. Most notably, Höflers research on the Germanic comitatus, and Wikander&#x27;s subsequent research on related warrior fraternities among early Indo-Iranians, would have enormous influence on Dumézil&#x27;s later research.

==Return to France==
Dumézil returned to France in 1933, where he through the assistance of Sylvain Lévi, a friend of Meillet, was able to gain a position at the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE). From 1935 to 1968, Dumézil was Director of Studies at the Department of Comparative Religion at EPHE. In this capacity he was responsible for teaching and research on Indo-European religions. Students of Dumézil during this time include Roger Caillois. At EPHE, through the recommendation of Lévi, Dumézil also attended lectures by sinologist Marcel Granet, whose methodology for the study of religions was to have a strong influence on Dumézil. Seeking to acquire knowledge of non-Indo-European cultures, Dumézil became proficient in Chinese and gained a deep understanding of Chinese mythology.

In his research on the social structure of ancient Indo-Iranians, Dumézil was greatly aided by Benveniste, who had earlier been critical of Dumézil&#x27;s theories. During his early years at EPHE, Dumézil modified many his theories. Most importantly, he increasingly shifted his focus from linguistic evidence to evidence from ancient social structures. Iranologists who influenced Dumézil in this approach include Arthur Christensen, James Darmesteter, Hermann Güntert and Herman Lommel. Notable works of Dumézil from this period include &quot;Ouranos-Varuna&quot; (1934) and &quot;Flamen-Brahman&quot; (1935). &quot;Ouranos-Varuna&quot; examined similarities in Greek and Vedic mythology, while &quot;Flamen-Brahman&quot; examined the existence of a distinct priestly class among the Proto-Indo-Europeans.

In the early 1930s, under the pseudonym &quot;Georges Marcenay&quot;, he wrote some articles for the right-wing newspapers &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;Le Jour&quot;, where he advocated an alliance between France and Italy against Nazi Germany. Dumézil&#x27;s opposition to Nazism figures prominently in several of his later works on Germanic religion. At this time Dumézil joined the Grande Loge de France, a pro-Jewish masonic lodge, for which he would later be persecuted by the Nazis.

==Formulation of the trifunctional hypothesis==
In the late 1930s, Dumézil broadened his research to include the study of Germanic religion. His research on Germanic religion was greatly influenced by the renowned Dutch philologist Jan de Vries, and also by Höfler. It was while lecturing on the Indo-European component in Germanic religion at Uppsala University in the spring of 1938 that Dumézil made a major discovery which was to revolutionize his future research. In his subsequent &quot;Mythes et dieux des Germains&quot; (1939), Dumézil found that early Germanic society was characterized by the same social divisions as those among the early Indo-Iranians. On this basis, Dumézil formulated his trifunctional hypothesis, which argued that ancient Indo-European societies were characterized by a trifunctional hierarchy respectively composed of priests, warriors and producers.

In Dumézil&#x27;s trifunctional model, the priests were responsible for the &quot;maintenance of cosmic and juridical sovereignty&quot;, while warriors were tasked with the &quot;exercise of physical prowess&quot;, and the commoners were responsible for &quot;the promotion of physical well-being, fertility, wealth, and so on&quot;. In Norse mythology, these functions were according to Dumézil represented by Týr and Odin, Thor, and Njörðr and Freyr, while in Vedic mythology, they were represented by Varuna and Mitra, Indra, and the Aśvins. Dumézil&#x27;s trifunctional hypothesis would come to revolutionize modern research on ancient civilizations.

==Career during World War II==

In the prelude to World War II, Dumézil returned to military service as a captain of the reserves in the French Army. He was subsequently posted at Liège as a liaison officer with the Belgian Army. Through the assistance of Maxime Weygand, a friend of his father, Dumézil was in April 1940 posted to the French military mission in Ankara, Turkey, where he remained during the Battle of France. He was repatriated to France in September 1940, and subsequently returned to full-time teaching at EPHE. Because he had been a Freemason as a young man, Dumézil was fired from EPHE by the pro-Nazi Vichy government in early 1941. Through the influence of colleagues, he was however able to regain his position in the fall of 1943.

During the war, Dumézil significantly reformulated his theories, and applied his trifunctional hypothesis to the study of Indo-Iranians, most notably in his work &quot;Mitra-Varuna&quot; (1940). In this work, Dumézil suggested that the Indo-Iranian gods Mitra and Varuna represented juridical and religious sovereignty respectively, and that these functions were relics of an earlier Indo-European tradition also manifested in Roman and Norse mythology. In works such as &quot;Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus&quot; (1941), &quot;Horace et les Curiaces&quot; (1942), &quot;Servius et la Fortune&quot; (1943) and &quot;Naissance de Rome&quot; (1944), Dumézil applied his trifunctional hypothesis to the study of the Indo-European heritage of ancient Rome.

==Expanding the trifunctional hypothesis==
From the late 1940s onwards, the comparative study of Vedic, Roman and Norse mythology and society would constitute the main focus of Dumézil&#x27;s research. Iranian and Greek mythology played less conspicuous roles in his research. &quot;Naissance des archanges&quot; (1945) is his sole book on Iranian and Zoroastrian material. In this work, Dumézil suggests that the pantheon of the Mitanni was derived from an earlier pantheon shared by all Indo-Iranians, and that the main deities in the Indo-Iranian pantheon represented the three functions of Indo-European society. According to Dumézil, it was only during the rise of Zoroaster that Ahura Mazda became the chief deity in Iranian mythology.

In the years immediately after World War II, Dumézil recruited Claude Lévi-Strauss and Mircea Eliade to EPHE, and both became close friends whom he strongly influenced. These three men are widely considered the most influential mythographers of all time. Notable works published by Dumézil in the late 1940s include &quot;Tarpeia&quot; (1947), &quot;Loki&quot; (1948), &quot;L&#x27;Héritage Indo-Européen à Rome&quot; (1949) and &quot; Le Troisième souverain&quot; (1949). The latter work examined the role of Aryaman and his Indo-European counterparts, such the Norse god Heimdallr, in wider Indo-European mythology. Through several influential works of his friend Wikander, Dumézil came to doubt the universalist theories of Durkheim and Lévi-Strauss, and thus contended that the trinfuctional structure of Indo-European society was a distinct characteristic of the Indo-Europeans. Dumézil had studied the languages and mythology of several indigenous peoples of the Americas, and contended that trifunctionalism was not prevalent among those peoples.

Dumézil was elected to the Collège de France in 1949, where he until 1968 was Chair of Indo-European Civilization. This position was specifically created for him. In the 1950s and 1960s, Dumézil&#x27;s theories gained increasing acceptance among scholars. The spread of Dumézil&#x27;s theories was greatly aided by support he received from friends such as Émile Benveniste, Stig Wikander, Otto Höfler and Jan de Vries. Notable Iranologists who adopted Dumézil&#x27;s theories include Benveniste, Wikander, Geo Widengren, Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin and Marijan Mole. Dumézil was however also criticized by certain Indologists, Iranologists and Romanists. Indologist Paul Thieme notably argued that the gods of the Mitanni were distinctly Indo-Aryan rather than Indo-Iranian, and that Dumézil&#x27;s reconstruction of Indo-Iranian religion was thus mistaken. Dumézil responded vigorously to such criticism, while also continuously refining his theories. Most notably, Dumézil modified his theories on the trifunctional Indo-European social structure, which he now regarded more as an ideology than an established system.

In 1955, Dumézil spent several months as a visiting professor at the University of Lima, during which he dedicated much time the study of the language and mythology of the Quechua people. During the 1950s, Dumézil conducted much research on what he hypothesised to be a war between the various functions in Indo-European mythology, which he suggested culminated in the incorporation of the third function into the first and second function. Dumézil&#x27;s ideas on this topic were published in &quot;Aspects de la fonction guerrière chez les Indo-Européens&quot; (1956). Other notable works published by Dumézil in the 1950s include &quot;Hadingus&quot; (1953), and several works on Roman, Celtic and Germanic religion. His &quot;L&#x27;Idéologie tripartie des Indo-Européens&quot;, published in 1958, has been described as the best introductory work on Dumézil&#x27;s core ideas.

==Retirement==

Dumézil retired from teaching in 1968, but nevertheless continued a vigorous program of research and writing which continued until his death. He would eventually become proficient in more than 40 languages, including all branches of the Indo-European languages, most languages of the Caucasus, and indigenous languages of the Americas (most notably Quechuan). Dumézil is credited with having saved the Ubykh language from extinction. His magnum opus, &quot;Mythe et epopee&quot;, provides a thorough overview of the trifunctional ideology of Indo-European mythology, and was published in three volumes in (1968–1973). In 1974, Dumézil would earn the Prix Paul Valery for this work.

Dumézil research has been credited with being largely responsible for the revival of Indo-European studies and comparative mythology in the latter parth of the 20th century. He was generally regarded as the world&#x27;s foremost expert on the comparative study of Indo-European mythology. From the late 1960s towards the end of his life, Dumézil&#x27;s research came to be widely celebrated in the United States, where many of his works on Indo-European mythology were translated into English and published. Additional works inspired by Dumézil&#x27;s theories were also published in the United States by scholars such as Jaan Puhvel, C. Scott Littleton, Donald J. Ward, Udo Strutynski and Dean A. Miller. Many of these scholars were associated with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

Dumézil was made an Honorary Professor of the College de France in 1969, and became a Member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1970. Dumézil was a visiting professor at UCLA in 1971. He was elected to the highly prestigious Académie Française in 1975. His election to Académie Française was sponsored by Lévi-Strauss, who gave him the welcoming address. Dumézil was also an Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium, Corresponding Member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy, Honorary Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and the recipient of honorary doctorates from the universities of Uppsala, Istanbul, Berne and Liège. He was an Officer of the Legion of Honor.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Dumézil vigorously continued with research and publishing, and devoted himself particularly to the study of the Indo-European components in Ossetian and Scythian mythology. The much awaited third edition of his &quot;Mitra-Varuna&quot; was published in 1977. He received the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca in 1984.

In his later years, Dumézil became a visible figure in French society, and was frequently interviewed and cited in the public press. His theories on Indo-European society were celebrated by Nouvelle Droite figures such as Alain de Benoist, Michel Poniatowski and Jean Haudry, but Dumézil was careful to distance himself from them. Dumézil openly identified with the political right, but always presented his works as apolitical, and had many friends and admirers on the left, such as Michel Foucault.

===Criticism of political affiliations===

In the 1980–1990s, Dumézil came under heavy criticism from certain scholars, particularly left-wing historians, who accused Dumézil of being a crypto-Fascist and a neo-traditionalist, by implicitly defending in his scholarly writings the restoration of a traditional hierarchical order in Europe (e.g. the three estates). Many of these critics pointed out that Dumézil&#x27;s lifelong close friend Pierre Gaxotte had been the secretary of Action Française leader Charles Maurras, and that his work had been influential on members of the European New Right, including Alain de Benoist, Jean Haudry, or Roger Pearson, who used his theories to support far-right political positions, with an &quot;Indo-European race&quot; (conflated with white people) being seen as superior to all other peoples. Bruce Lincoln has argued that Dumézil &quot;maintained a cautiously ambiguous relation&quot; with Nouvelle Droite figures like de Benoist and Haudry, &quot;both of whom courted him avidly&quot;.

During the 1930s, Dumézil supported the far-right, royalist, anti-democratic, and anti-German Action Française. While he held for a while Benito Mussolini in high regard, he steadfastly opposed Nazism and voiced as a journalist his opposition to the growing danger posed by German nationalism. However, Dumézil never joined Action Française, contending that &quot;too many things separated [him] from them. The credo of the Action Française was a block: it forbade both appreciating Edmond Rostand and believing in the innocence of Captain Dreyfus.&quot; Furthermore, Dumézil joined the Free Masonry in the early 1930s as a member of the Portique lodge of the Grande Loge de France of the Scottish Rite, and was consequently dismissed from his teaching positions and from the civil service by the collaborationist Vichy State during World War II.

Some critics, particularly adherents of Lévi-Strauss, contended that the mythological and social structures Dumézil identified with Indo-Europeans were not distinctly Indo-European, but rather characteristic of all humanity. Among those were Colin Renfrew, who doubts that Indo-Europeans had anything distinctly in common beyond speaking Indo-European languages. The harshest critics of Dumézil were Arnaldo Momigliano and Carlo Ginzburg, who charged Dumézil with having &quot;sympathy for Nazi culture&quot; due to his writings on Germanic religion in the 1930s. They also accused Dumézil&#x27;s trifunctional hypothesis of similarity with Fascism, and wrote that his reconstruction of Indo-European society was motivated by a desire to abolish &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; values. Momigliano had himself been a member of the National Fascist Party in the 1930s, but was not open about this.

Dumézil was also defended by many colleagues, including C. Scott Littleton, Jaan Puhvel, Edgar C. Polomé, Dean A. Miller, Udo Strutynski, and most notably by Didier Eribon. Polomé and Miller saw the criticism of Dumézil as an expression of political correctness and Marxist ideology, and questioned the scholarly credentials of the critics. Dumézil himself responded vigorously to these accusations, pointing out that he had never been a member of a Fascist organization, never been sympathetic to Fascist ideology, and that the ancient Indo-European hierarchical social structure never appealed to him. In order to clarify his political position, he declared to Éribon in 1987: &quot;the principle, not simply monarchical, but dynastic, which protects the highest office of the State from caprices and ambitions, seemed to me, and still seems to me, preferable to the generalized election in which we have been living since Danton and Bonaparte. The example of the [constitutional] monarchies of the North (of Europe) confirmed to me this feeling. Of course, the formula is not applicable in France.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Dumézil died in Paris from a massive stroke on 11 October 1986. He had deliberately refrained from writing a memoir, believing that the legacy of his work should stand on its scholarly merits alone. However, shortly before his death, Dumézil made a series of in-depth interviews with his defender Eribon, which were subsequently published in &quot;Entretiens avec Georges Dumézil&quot; (1987). This book remains the closest Dumézil ever came to writing a memoir. Upon his death, Dumézil left a number of unfishined works on Indo-European mythology, some of which were subsequently edited by his friends and published.

Accusations of Fascist sympathies continued after Dumézil&#x27;s death. Eribon&#x27;s &quot;Faut-il brûler Dumézil?&quot; (1992) has been credited with permanently debunking accusations that Dumézil was a crypto-Fascist. Charges of Fascist sympathies have nevertheless continued to be leveled, most notably by Eliade&#x27;s former student Bruce Lincoln. Inspired by the critique of Momigliano and Ginzburg, Lincoln has criticized Dumézil from a Marxist perspective, and suggested that Dumézil was a Germanophobic Fascist. Similar accusations have also been leveled by the Swedish Marxist historian Stefan Arvidsson, who hopes that the &quot;exposure&quot; of Dumézil&#x27;s alleged political Fascist sympathies may lead to the abolishment (&quot;Ragnarök&quot;) of the concept of Indo-European mythology .

Throughout his career, Dumézil published more than seventy-five books and hundreds of scholarly articles. His research continues to have a strong influence among Indo-Europeanists, classicists, Celticists, Germanicists, and Indologists. Prominent scholars heavily influenced by Dumézil include Emile Benveniste, Stig Wikander, Jan de Vries, Gabriel Turville-Petre, Werner Betz, Edgar C. Polomé, Jaan Puvhvel, Joël Grisward, Nicholas Allen, Georges Charachidzé, François-Xavier Dillmann, Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, , Lucien Gerschel, Emily Lyle, Dean A. Miller, Alwyn Rees, Brinley Rees, Robert Schilling, Bernard Sergent, Udo Strutynski, Donald J. Ward and Atsuhiko Yoshida. Along with Marija Gimbutas, the research of Dumézil continues to form the basis for modern Indo-European studies. His formulation of the trifunctional hypothesis has been described by C. Scott Littleton as one of the most important scholarly achievements of the 20th century. Since 1995, the Académie Française awards the annual for a work of philology.

<text>Gray&#x27;s grasshopper warbler (Helopsaltes fasciolatus), also known as Gray&#x27;s warbler, is a species of grass warbler in the family Locustellidae; it was formerly included in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; assemblage.

The Sakhalin grasshopper warbler was formerly considered conspecific.

==Distribution and habitat==
This small passerine bird breeds in southern Siberia, northeastern China and Korea. It is migratory, wintering in southeast Asia. It is a species found in lowland and coastal regions, nesting in forests or thickets.

==Description==
This is the largest of all the &quot;Locustella&quot; warblers, approaching the size of the great reed warbler. The adult has an unstreaked olive-brown back, uniformly grey breast and buff underparts, with unmottled dull orange undertail coverts.

The song is a short phrase, loud and distinctive; nothing like the insect-like reeling of European &quot;Locustella&quot; species, and more musical than that of Pallas&#x27;s grasshopper warbler.

<text>Tab Hunter (born Arthur Andrew Kelm; July 11, 1931 – July 8, 2018) was an American actor, singer, film producer, and author. Known for his blond hair and clean-cut good looks, Hunter starred in more than forty films. During the 1950s and 1960s, in his twenties and thirties, Hunter was a Hollywood heart-throb, acting in numerous roles and appearing on the covers of hundreds of magazines. His notable screen credits include &quot;Battle Cry&quot; (1955), &quot;The Girl He Left Behind&quot; (1956), &quot;Gunman&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1958), &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1958), and &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981) . Hunter also had a music career in the late 1950s; in 1957, he released a no. 1 hit single &quot;Young Love&quot;. Hunter&#x27;s 2005 autobiography, &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

==Early life==
Arthur Andrew Kelm was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Gertrude () and Charles Kelm. Kelm&#x27;s father was Jewish, and his mother was a German immigrant from Hamburg. He had an older brother, Walter. Kelm&#x27;s father was reportedly abusive. Within a few years of Kelm&#x27;s birth, his parents divorced. He was raised in California, living with his mother, his brother, and his maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (née Sonnenfleth) Gelien; the family resided in San Francisco, Long Beach and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2003/09/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His mother re-assumed her maiden surname, Gelien, and changed her sons&#x27; surnames as well. As a teenager, Arthur Gelien (as he was then known) was a figure skater, competing in both singles and pairs. Gelien was sent to Catholic school by his religious mother.

Gelien joined the U.S. Coast Guard at age fifteen in 1946, lying about his age to enlist. While in the Coast Guard, he gained the nickname &quot;Hollywood&quot; for his penchant for watching movies rather than going to bars while on liberty. When his superiors discovered his true age, they discharged him. Gelien met actor Dick Clayton socially; Clayton suggested that he become an actor.

==Career==

===1950s===
Dick Clayton introduced Gelien to agent Henry Willson, who specialized in representing beefcake male stars such as Robert Wagner and Rock Hudson. It was Willson who named him &quot;Tab Hunter&quot;.

Hunter&#x27;s first film role was a minor part in a film noir, &quot;The Lawless&quot; (1950). Hunter was a friend of character actor Paul Guilfoyle, who suggested him to director Stuart Heisler; Heisler was looking for an unknown to play the lead in &quot;Island of Desire&quot; (1952) opposite Linda Darnell. The film, essentially a two-hander between Hunter and Darnell, was a hit.

Hunter supported George Montgomery in &quot;Gun Belt&quot; (1953), a Western produced by Edward Small. Small used him again for a war film, &quot;The Steel Lady&quot; (1953), supporting Rod Cameron, and as the lead in an adventure tale, &quot;Return to Treasure Island&quot; (1954). He began acting on stage, appearing in a production of &quot;Our Town&quot;. Hunter was then offered, and accepted, a contract at Warner Bros.
One of Hunter&#x27;s first films for Warner Bros. was &quot;The Sea Chase&quot; (1955), supporting John Wayne and Lana Turner. It was a big hit, but Hunter&#x27;s part was relatively small. Rushes were seen by William A. Wellman, who cast Hunter to play the younger brother of Robert Mitchum in &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; (1954). It was a solid hit and Hunter began to get more notice.

His breakthrough role came when he was cast as the young Marine Danny in 1955&#x27;s World War II drama &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, which was the year&#x27;s third most financially successful film. His character has an affair with an older woman, but ends up marrying the girl next door. It was based on a bestseller by Leon Uris and became Warner Bros.&#x27; largest grossing film that year, cementing Hunter&#x27;s position as one of Hollywood&#x27;s top young romantic leads.

In September 1955, the tabloid magazine &quot;Confidential&quot; reported that Hunter had been arrested for disorderly conduct in 1950. The innuendo-laced article, and a second one focusing on Rory Calhoun&#x27;s prison record, were the result of a deal Henry Willson had brokered with the scandal rag in exchange for not revealing to the public the sexual orientation of his more prominent client, Rock Hudson. The report had no negative effect on Hunter&#x27;s career. A few months later, he was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations. In 1956, he received 62,000 valentines. Hunter, James Dean, and Natalie Wood were the last actors to be placed under an exclusive studio contract at Warner Bros. Warner decided to promote him to star status, teaming him with Natalie Wood in two films, a Western, &quot;The Burning Hills&quot; (1956), directed by Heisler, and &quot;The Girl He Left Behind&quot; (1956), a service comedy. These films also proved to be a hit with audiences. Warners planned a third teaming of Hunter and Wood but Hunter rejected the third picture, thus ending Warners&#x27; attempt to make Hunter and Wood the William Powell and Myrna Loy of the 1950s. Hunter was Warner Bros.&#x27; most popular male star from 1955 until 1959.

Hunter received strong critical acclaim for a television performance he gave in the debut episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (&quot;Forbidden Area&quot;, 1956) written by Rod Serling and directed by John Frankenheimer.

Hunter&#x27;s acting career was at its peak. William Wellman used him again in a war film, &quot;Lafayette Escadrille&quot; (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, &quot;Gunman&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1958). Hunter claimed, &quot;When Gunman&#x27;s Walk premiered the following summer, it was one of the proudest moments of my career.&quot; Hunter starred in the musical film &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1958), in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway musical, and Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the best-selling 1954 book &quot;The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant&quot; by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was interested only in recreating the stage version word for word. He also appeared in the western &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; (1959) (with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth) and starred in the romantic drama &quot;That Kind of Woman&quot; (1959) (with Sophia Loren).

====Music career====

Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song &quot;Young Love,&quot; which was No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart), and became one of the larger hits of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll era. It sold more than two million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

Hunter had another hit single, &quot;Ninety-Nine Ways&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 in the United States and No. 5 in the United Kingdom. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor&#x27;s contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter.

===1960s===
Hunter&#x27;s failure to win the role of Tony in the film adaptation of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) prompted him to agree to star in a weekly television sitcom. &quot;The Tab Hunter Show&quot; had moderate ratings (due to being scheduled opposite &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;) and lasted for one season (1960–61) of 32 episodes. It was a hit in the United Kingdom, where it ranked as one of the most watched situation comedies of the year. Hunter&#x27;s costars in the series included Richard Erdman, Jerome Cowan, and Reta Shaw.

Hunter had a starring role as Debbie Reynolds&#x27; love interest in the romantic comedy &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot; (1961). He played the lead in an Italian swashbuckler shot in Egypt, &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; (1962). He was in a war movie for American International Pictures, &quot;Operation Bikini&quot; (1963).
In 1964, he starred on Broadway opposite Tallulah Bankhead in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot;.

He had a starring role in &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot; (1964), a surf film for Columbia, followed by a movie in Britain, the crime drama &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (1964). He stayed in England to make another picture for AIP, the science fiction film &quot;War Gods of the Deep&quot; (1965) starring Vincent Price. Back in Hollywood, he had a supporting role in the comedies &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965) and &quot;Birds Do It&quot; (1966). He starred in a film directed by Richard Rush, the low budget comedy &quot;The Fickle Finger of Fate&quot; (1967).

For a short time in the late 1960s, after several seasons of starring in summer stock and dinner theater in shows such as &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;The Tender Trap&quot;, &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot;, and &quot;West Side Story&quot; with some of the New York cast, Hunter settled in the south of France and acted in some Italian films including &quot;Vengeance Is My Forgiveness&quot; (1968), &quot;The Last Chance&quot; (1968), and &quot;Bridge over the Elbe&quot; (1969).

===1970s===
Hunter had the lead role in the psychological horror film &quot;Sweet Kill&quot; (1973), the first movie from director Curtis Hanson. His performance earned good reviews. He won a co-starring role in the successful western film &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972), starring Paul Newman. He had small roles in &quot;Timber Tramps&quot; (1975), &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976) and &quot;&quot; (1978). In 1977 he played George Shumway, the father of Mary Hartman (played by Louise Lasser) on &quot;Forever Fernwood&quot;, a spinoff of the soap-like sitcom &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;.

===1980s===
Hunter&#x27;s career was revived in the 1980s, when he starred opposite actor Divine in John Waters&#x27; &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981) and Paul Bartel&#x27;s &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; (1985). Both of these films were hits with audiences. He played Mr. Stuart, the substitute teacher in the musical &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), who sang &quot;Reproduction&quot;. Hunter had a major role in the horror film &quot;Cameron&#x27;s Closet&quot; (1989).

===Later career===
Hunter&#x27;s last film role came in the horse-themed family film &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1992). Hunter, a longstanding horse owner, wrote the original story and co-produced the film with his life partner, Allan Glaser.

Hunter&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star&quot; (2005), co-written with Eddie Muller, became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, as did the paperback edition in 2007. In his memoir, Hunter officially came out as gay, confirming rumors that had circulated since the height of his fame. The book was nominated for several awards. It entered the &quot;New York Times&quot;″ bestseller list for a third time on June 28, 2015, upon the release of &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential&quot;, an award-winning documentary based upon the memoir. The documentary was directed by Jeffrey Schwarz and produced by Allan Glaser. As of June 2022, a feature film about Hunter to be produced by Glaser, J. J. Abrams and Zachary Quinto was in development at Paramount Pictures. Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning writer Doug Wright is attached to create the screenplay.

Hunter has a star for his contributions to the music industry on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6320 Hollywood Blvd. In 2007, the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated a Golden Palm Star to him.

==Personal life==
Hunter came out publicly as a gay man in his 2005 memoir. According to William L. Hamilton of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, detailed reports about Hunter&#x27;s alleged romances with close friends Debbie Reynolds and Natalie Wood during his young adult years had been strictly the product of studio publicity departments. As Wood and Hunter embarked on a well-publicized but fictitious romance, insiders had developed their own headline for the item: &quot;Natalie Wood and Tab Wouldn&#x27;t&quot;. Regarding Hollywood&#x27;s studio era, Hunter said, &quot;[life] was difficult for me, because I was living two lives at that time. A private life of my own, which I never discussed, never talked about to anyone. And then my Hollywood life, which was just trying to learn my craft and succeed...&quot; The star emphasized that the word gay&#x27; ... wasn&#x27;t even around in those days, and if anyone ever confronted me with it, I&#x27;d just kinda freak out. I was in total denial. I was just not comfortable in that Hollywood scene, other than the work process.&quot; &quot;There was a lot written about my sexuality, and the press was pretty darn cruel,&quot; the actor said, but what &quot;moviegoers wanted to hold in their hearts were the boy-next-door marines, cowboys, and swoon-bait sweethearts I portrayed.&quot;
Hunter had a long-term relationship with actor Anthony Perkins after having met him at the Chateau Marmont during the filming of &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; in 1956. Their relationship spanned two to four years, and Hunter has said that they only broke up because of Perkins&#x27;s movie studio, Paramount, and the studio system. However, he remembered Perkins as a &quot;special part of my journey. He wanted to be a movie star more than anything. I wanted that too, but not with the same kind of drive he had. We were such opposites - but then maybe that was the attraction.&quot; He also had relationships with champion figure skater Ronnie Robertson, actor Neal Noorlag, and Soviet-born ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev before settling down and marrying his partner/spouse of more than 35 years, film producer Allan Glaser.

Hunter was raised in his mother&#x27;s Catholic faith. Except for a period in his youth, Hunter was a practicing Catholic for the rest of his life. When asked about his Jewish identity, due to his father and partner/spouse being Jewish, Hunter stated that he did not identify as Jewish. Hunter was an avid horse owner.

==Death==
On July 8, 2018, three days shy of his 87th birthday, Hunter died after suffering cardiac arrest that arose from complications related to deep vein thrombosis. According to his husband, Allan Glaser, Hunter&#x27;s death was &quot;sudden and unexpected.&quot;

The Vines recorded &quot;Winning Days&quot; in May 2003 at Bearsville Studios with producer Rob Schnapf, who had also produced their debut album &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;. &quot;Fuck the World&quot; (later abbreviated to &quot;F.T.W.&quot;) was the first song released from &quot;Winning Days&quot; and was released on 15 December 2003, three months prior to the album&#x27;s release. The song is sarcastic in nature despite what its title seems to imply; as stated in a 2005 &quot;NME&quot; article, &quot;&quot;Winning Days&quot; is anything but&quot;. During interviews given by lead singer Craig Nicholls in 2004, he stated &quot;I definitely think the world is a good place, but maybe it would be better if people didn&#x27;t hate so much and kill animals. At the same time, it&#x27;s like, whatever. It&#x27;s just a planet, that&#x27;s all.&quot;

The next single &quot;Ride&quot; was released on 23 February 2004. &quot;Ride&quot; reached number 94 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of 2004.

The title track was released as the third and final single on 24 May 2004.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Winning Days&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 50 based on 23 reviews.

<text>Goethe University Frankfurt () is a public research university located in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It was founded in 1914 as a citizens&#x27; university, which means it was founded and funded by the wealthy and active liberal citizenry of Frankfurt. The original name in German was Universität Frankfurt am Main. In 1932, the university&#x27;s name was extended in honour of one of the most famous native sons of Frankfurt, the poet, philosopher and writer/dramatist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The university currently has around 48,000 students, distributed across four major campuses within the city.

The university celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014. The first female president of the university, Birgitta Wolff, was sworn into office in 2015, and was succeeded by Enrico Schleiff in 2021. 20 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the university, including Max von Laue and Max Born. The university is also affiliated with 18 winners of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize.

Goethe University is part of the IT cluster Rhine-Main-Neckar. The Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, the Goethe University Frankfurt and the Technische Universität Darmstadt together form the Rhine-Main-Universities (RMU).

==History==
The historical roots of the university can be traced back as far as 1484, when a City Council Library was established with a bequest from the patrician Ludwig von Marburg. Merged with other collections, it was renamed City Library in 1668 and became the university library in 1914. Depending on the country, the date of foundation is recorded differently. According to Anglo-American calculations, the founding date of Goethe University would be 1484. In Germany, the date on which the right to award doctorates is granted is considered the founding year of a university.

The modern history of the University of Frankfurt can be dated to 28 September 1912, when the foundation contract for the &quot;Königliche Universität zu Frankfurt am Main&quot; (Royal University at Frankfurt on the Main) was signed at the Römer, Frankfurt&#x27;s town hall. Royal permission for the university was granted on 10 June 1914, and the first enrollment of students began on 16 October 1914. Members of Frankfurt&#x27;s Jewish community, including the Speyer family, Wilhelm Ralph Merton, and the industrialists Leo Gans and Arthur von Weinberg donated two thirds of the foundation capital of the University of Frankfurt.

The university has been best known historically for its Institute for Social Research (founded 1924), the institutional home of the Frankfurt School, a preeminent 20th-century school of philosophy and social thought. Some of the well-known scholars associated with this school include Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Jürgen Habermas, as well as Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, and Walter Benjamin. Other well-known scholars at the University of Frankfurt include the sociologist Karl Mannheim, the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer, the philosophers of religion Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, and Paul Tillich, the psychologist Max Wertheimer, and the sociologist Norbert Elias.
The University of Frankfurt has at times been considered liberal, or left-leaning, and has had a reputation for Jewish and Marxist (or even Jewish-Marxist) scholarship. During the Nazi period, &quot;almost one third of its academics and many of its students were dismissed for racial and/or political reasons—more than at any other German university&quot;. The university also played a major part in the German student movement of 1968.

The university also has been influential in the natural sciences and medicine, with Nobel Prize winners including Max von Laue and Max Born, and breakthroughs such as the Stern–Gerlach experiment.

In recent years, the university has focused in particular on law, history, and economics, creating new institutes, such as the Institute for Law and Finance (ILF) and the Center for Financial Studies (CFS). One of the university&#x27;s ambitions is to become Germany&#x27;s leading university for finance and economics, given the school&#x27;s proximity to one of Europe&#x27;s financial centers. In cooperation with Duke University&#x27;s Fuqua School of Business, the Goethe Business School offers an MBA program. Goethe University has established an international award for research in financial economics, the Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics.

==Campuses==

The university is located across four campuses in Frankfurt am Main:

=== Campus Westend ===
The Westend Campus is the main location with the Presidential Board based in the Presidential and Administration Building (PA). The campus includes the I. G. Farben Building and numerous new buildings, including the House of Finance and the central lecture theatre building. In addition to the central administration, most departments, with the exception of Medicine and Natural Sciences, are or have been located here since 2001. The Language and Art Building (SKW) (FB 09) is currently the new building on campus. This campus is of particular historical significance, as Goethe University has inherited history through the acquisition of real estate.

&quot;Campus Westend&quot; of the university is dominated by the IG Farben Building by architect Hans Poelzig, an example of the modernist New Objectivity style. The style for the IG Farben Building was originally chosen as &quot;a symbol for the scientific and mercantile German manpower, made out of iron and stone&quot;, as the IG Farben director at the time of construction, Baron von Schnitzler, stated in his opening speech in October 1930.

After the university took over the complex in the 1990s, new buildings were added to the campus. On 30 May 2008, the House of Finance relocated to a new building designed by the architects Kleihues+Kleihues, following the style of the IG Farben Building. The upper floors of the House of Finance building have several separate offices as well as shared office space for researchers and students. The ground floor is open to the public and welcomes visitors with a spacious, naturally lit foyer that leads to lecture halls, seminar rooms, and the information center, a 24-hour reference library. The ground floor also accommodates computer rooms and a café. The floors, walls and ceiling of the foyer are decorated with a grid design that is continued throughout the entire building. The flooring is inspired by Raphael&#x27;s mural, &quot;The School of Athens&quot;.

The emergence of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) can be traced back to the Frankfurter Dokumente that were handed over in the I. G. Farben Building.

=== Campus Bockenheim ===
The Bockenheim campus is the former centre of the university, which still houses various parts of the language and cultural sciences, the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, the central building of the university library Johann Christian Senckenberg and some parts of the administration in buildings dating from the 1950s to the 1970s.

=== Campus Riedberg ===
The Riedberg campus, with university buildings built from around 1970, is home to the Departments of Physics, Biochemistry, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Biosciences and (largely) Earth Sciences, the Science Garden and a lecture theatre centre with the natural sciences departmental library.

=== Campus Niederrad ===
The Niederrad campus is home to the University Hospital and the Department of Medicine, with buildings and facilities that have grown historically since the 19th century as well as modern complexes.

=== Campus Ginnheim ===
Campus Ginnheim is the location of the athletics grounds, multiple tennis and volleyball courts, the sports halls, and the University Sports Centre. Ginnheim also houses many of the lecture halls for classes in physical education, sport psychology, and social sciences in sport.

=== General information ===
The university&#x27;s relocation programme, which has been intensified since the mid-1990s, aims to create a de facto three-campus university in the future. To this end, the units currently located in the Bockenheim district are also to be relocated, but not the sports grounds.

The public Botanical Garden Frankfurt am Main at the end of Siesmayerstraße, formerly associated with the biology campus (1956-2011), has been transferred to the City of Frankfurt am Main and the responsibility of the Palmengarten. Parts of the former Bockenheim campus, including the historic Jügelhaus, have been taken over by the Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung, while other parts have been left to local urban development. The formerly numerous other scattered university buildings in the Bockenheim district have been abandoned and partly demolished, partly put to other uses.

==Goethe Business School==
The Goethe Business School is a graduate business school at the university, established in 2004, part of the House of Finance at the Westend Campus and the IKB building. It is a non-profit foundation under private law held by the university. Its board of directors is led by Rolf-Ernst Breuer, who was chairman of the board of Deutsche Bank until 2006. The school has maintained a partnership in Executive Education with the Indian School of Business (ISB) since 2009.

==Logo==
The word/image mark used from 1980 to 2002 was developed by Adrian Frutiger. There are different types of basically the same logo.

* Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main
* Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main
* Goethe Universität

As old university logos never really &quot;expire&quot;, they remain valid. Since 2008, the university administration has made various changes to the practical name of the university and, accordingly, to the logo.

On 26 September 2016, another logo was also registered at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office as an individual trade mark, consisting only of the words &quot;GOETHE UNIVERSITY&quot;. However, this logo is not currently in use.

==The Deutsche Bank Prize==
The Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics honors renowned researchers who have made influential contributions to the fields of finance and money and macroeconomics, and whose work has led to practical and policy-relevant results. It is awarded biannually, since 2005, by the Center for Financial Studies, in partnership with Goethe University Frankfurt. The award carries an endowment of €50,000, which is donated by the Stiftungsfonds Deutsche Bank im Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.

==Student organisations==

=== Political university groups ===
According to information from the university, the political university groups are as follows:

* DGB Hochschulgruppe Frankfurt am Main
* DieLinke.SDS
* DL – Demokratische Linke Liste
* FDH – Fachschafteninitiative
* Demokratische Hochschule
* Grüne Hochschulgruppe
* JUSO Politische Hochschulgruppe Frankfurt
* Liberale Hochschulgruppe
* Linke Liste
* RCDS Frankfurt
* Rosa*Liste

There is little public information on the individual university groups and the work of the university committees, as there is usually only up-to-date information on university politics and/or university political actors on the respective websites of the General Students&#x27; Committee and the respective university parties, as well as representations in social networks. Further information and archives on university policy work at Goethe University do not exist, which is why there is hardly any transparency about university policy. There are official publications on the Goethe University website, which must be made in accordance with the Hessian Higher Education Act. These can also be found in the German National Library.

Little can be said about the political significance of university politics due to the lack of transparency in university politics as a whole and the lack of interest in its activities. Students are not very interested in university politics due to a voter turnout of less than 15% in recent years and the incidents and judgements against the AStA.

=== Student university groups and initiatives ===
The university management and the departments support numerous private and university-affiliated student groups, initiatives and private alumni organisations. There are also networks between the student university groups and initiatives via the departments and the Goethe University Network:
=== Student councils ===
The student councils at Goethe University are legally regulated by the Hessian Higher Education Act. They are therefore not student initiatives in the traditional sense, as they are legally binding institutions without their own legal personality.

=== Student initiatives from the Deutschlandstipendium ===
New student initiatives are regularly created at Goethe University as part of the Deutschlandstipendium programme. These initiatives are supported by the non-material support programme for the Deutschlandstipendium from the Presidential Board of Goethe University.

* Goethe Uni Tour/ExperienceCampus
* ExperienceFundraising
* uni:hautnah (mittlerweile integriert in die Studienberatung der Goethe Universität).
* Wissenschaftskommunikation

== Alumni organisations ==

=== University-related alumni organisations ===
Goethe University has its own non-exhaustive network of alumni organisations, a sponsors&#x27; association and its own e-mail distribution list for alumni. Alumni organisations require formal recognition and approval by the university administration in order to be listed as official alumni associations. Without such recognition, it is not possible for the association to list itself as an official alumni organisation of Goethe University. Officers of these organisations are mostly current and former professors as well as people in leading positions at Goethe University. The largest university-related alumni organisation with over 1,300 members is the Frankfurter Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Gesellschaft (fwwg), which was founded in 1988 and is open to the Department of Economics. The Association of Friends and Supporters of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main (&quot;Vereinigung von Freunden und Förderern der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main&quot;) acts unofficially as an umbrella organisation for the university-related alumni organisations at Goethe University and is also the university&#x27;s official support association.

=== Independent alumni organisations ===
Local, regional, national, European and international student initiatives have given rise to many parallel alumni networks that run in parallel and independently of each other. These include the alumni organisations of AIESEC, MTP - Marketing between Theory and Practice, European Law Students&#x27; Association, Erasmus Student Network and others. Student initiatives such as green finance consulting, Goethe Club, Goethe Gruppe or Night of Science, as well as political university groups, are further hybrids between student initiatives and alumni organisations. Independent alumni organisations are not recognised as official alumni organisations at Goethe University.

<text>The Cape Verde warbler (Acrocephalus brevipennis) is an Old World warbler in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. It is also known as the Cape Verde cane warbler or Cape Verde swamp warbler, and in Creole as &quot;tchota-de-cana&quot; or &quot;chincherote&quot; (also &quot;tchintchirote&quot;). It breeds on Santiago, Fogo, and São Nicolau in the Cape Verde Islands. It previously bred on Brava. This species is found in well-vegetated valleys, avoiding drier areas. It nests in reedbeds, two to three eggs being laid in a suspended nest.

==Description==
This is a medium-sized warbler, larger than the Eurasian reed warbler. It resembles that bird in appearance, grey-brown above, greyish-white below, with no obvious markings. The geographical isolation of the bird on the Cape Verde Islands prevents confusion with other similar species. The song is a distinctive liquid bubbling, like that of a bulbul.

==Distribution and habitat==
At one time it was thought that the Cape Verde warbler was restricted to the island of Santiago. After a specimen was found in a Lisbon museum, a survey was made on São Nicolau island in 1998 and some individuals were found there. In 2004 a further population was discovered on Fogo island and further survey found it was widespread across the north of the island up to altitudes of about 1,300 m. On Santiago it can be found across the whole island, including in Barragem de Poilão, S. Jorge, Serra Malagueta, Rui Vaz and Tarrafal. Although previously thought to be mainly restricted to woodland and scrub, it is now reported from a wider range of habitats including well-vegetated valleys, reedbeds, cultivated land and around water sources such as dams.

==Status==
The population trend of the Cape Verde warbler is thought to be declining, probably because of habitat destruction and the droughts that have beset the islands. With its restricted range and relatively small population, this bird has been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a vulnerable species.

<doc id="539096" wikidata="Q3005628" url="?curid=539096" title="Make Trax">
<text>Make Trax, originally released in Japan as , is a 1981 maze game developed by Alpha Denshi and published as an arcade video game by Kural Samno Electric in Japan. It was licensed in Europe to Exidy, which released it under its original title &quot;Crush Roller&quot;, and in North America to Williams Electronics, who released it as &quot;Make Trax&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a paintbrush, reddish-orange in color, and must paint the entire maze in order to advance to the next stage. Two fish — one yellow, the other light blue — emerge from separate aquariums to pursue the paintbrush around the board, and if either of the fish succeeds in making contact with the paintbrush, the player loses one of three lives.

The player may use two &quot;rollers&quot; to attack the fish. They are located on overpasses, one vertical in its orientation, the other horizontal. To use them, the player positions the paintbrush on its forward end, waits for either or both of the fish to approach, then pushes the paintbrush along the roller, attacking the fish. The fish is removed from the maze for a few seconds, then returns to one of the aquariums and resumes its pursuit of the paintbrush. Killing fish in this manner scores bonus points.

The fish initially are dumb, but as time goes on they get &quot;smarter&quot; learning to avoid the roller when the paintbrush nears it, and develop strategies to trap the player between them.

A third character, appearing to be an animal, rolling tire, or invisible man depending on the level, may enter the maze and leave tracks that must be painted over in order for the board to be completed. The player can limit the damage by running over the figure, which not only stops further tracks from being left but also awards the player a score, which progressively increases as more boards are cleared.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Crush Roller&quot; was the ninth highest-grossing arcade game of 1981.

==Legacy==
ADK remade the game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color which was released worldwide by SNK under its original name &quot;Crush Roller&quot; in 1999. The game mechanics are largely the same as its arcade counterpart, though the level design was adapted to fit the smaller screen size. Graphics and sound were also improved thanks to the more powerful hardware. This version was later re-released as part of the Windows port of &quot;Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 1&quot; in 2021.

A clone called &quot;Brush Roller&quot; for the Famicom/NES was programmed in 1990 by Hwang Shinwei and published by RCM Group. This game was later hacked by NTDEC to make &quot;Bookyman&quot;, which was released on the Caltron 6-in-1 and the Asder 20-in-1. It replaced the title screen, some of the graphics, and revamped the sound and music. It also fixed the bugs that cause music temporary stops when the roller died or crush enemy and eliminated corrupted sprites at left maze scoreboard when completed stage which are replaced by some hollow squares. The original NTDEC release and Asder version retained the original sounds from Brush Roller, despite the Asder version released a year later.

A &quot;speed-up&quot; modification named &quot;Make Trax Turbo&quot; allows the paintbrush to move faster (but not the fish).

<text>The Opéra de Monte-Carlo is an opera house which is part of the Monte Carlo Casino located in the Principality of Monaco.

With the lack of cultural diversions available in Monaco in the 1870s, Prince Charles III, along with the Société des bains de mer, decided to include a concert hall as part of the casino. The main public entrance to the hall was from the casino, while Charles III&#x27;s private entrance was on the western side. It opened in 1879 and became known as the Salle Garnier, after the architect Charles Garnier, who designed it.

During the renovation of the Salle Garnier in 2004–05, the company presented operas at the &quot;Salle des Princes&quot; in the local Grimaldi Forum, a modern conference and performance facility where Les Ballets de Monte Carlo and the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra regularly perform.

==Salle Garnier==


The architect Charles Garnier also designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. The Salle Garnier is much smaller, seating 524, compared to about 2,000 for the Palais Garnier, and unlike the Paris theatre, which was started in 1861 and only completed in 1875, the Salle Garnier was constructed in only eight and a half months. Nevertheless, its ornate style was heavily influenced by that of the Palais Garnier, and many of the same artists worked on both theatres, including Gustave Boulanger. Although the Monte Carlo theatre was not originally intended for opera, it was soon used frequently for that purpose and was remodeled in 1898–99 by Henri Schmit, primarily in the stage area, to make it more suitable for opera.

The hall was inaugurated on 25 January 1879 with a performance by Sarah Bernhardt dressed as a nymph. The first opera performed there was Robert Planquette&#x27;s &quot;Le Chevalier Gaston&quot; on 8 February 1879, followed by three additional operas in the first season.

With the influence of the first director, Jules Cohen (who was instrumental in bringing Adelina Patti) and the fortunate combination of Raoul Gunsbourg, the new director from 1892, and Princess Alice, the opera-loving American wife of Charles III&#x27;s successor, Albert I, the company was thrust onto the world&#x27;s opera community stage. Gunsbourg remained for sixty years, overseeing such premiere productions as Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; in 1893, and the first appearances in January 1894 of the heroic Italian tenor Francesco Tamagno in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello,&quot; whose title role he had created for the opera&#x27;s premiere in Italy. Conductor Arturo Vigna served as music director of the Monte Carlo Opera from 1895 to 1903.

By the early years of the twentieth century, the Salle Garnier was to see such great performers as Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso in &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (in 1902), and Feodor Chaliapin in the premiere of Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; (1910). This production formed part of a long association between the company and Massenet and his operas, two of which were presented there posthumously.

Other famous twentieth-century singers to appear at Monte Carlo included Titta Ruffo, Geraldine Farrar, Mary Garden, Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Georges Thill, Lily Pons, and Mary McCormic.

Apart from Massenet, composers whose works had their first performances at Monte Carlo included Saint-Saëns (&quot;Hélène&quot;, 1904), Mascagni (&quot;Amica,&quot; 1905), and Puccini (, 1917). Indeed, since its inauguration, the theatre has hosted 45 world premiere productions of operas. René Blum was retained to found the Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo. The &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the Salle Garnier has passed, since small companies with small houses are not able to mount highly expensive productions. Nonetheless, the present day company still presents a season containing five or six operas.

==Gala Events in Salle Garnier==
Three times in its 130-year history the Opéra was transformed into a spectacular venue to host gala-dinners. The first occasion was in 1966 for the celebration of centenary of Monte-Carlo hosted by Grace Kelly and Rainier III; the second was for the royal wedding of Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene. The Opéra was transformed for the third time on 27 July 2013 to host the Love Ball, a fundraising gala event organised by the Naked Heart Foundation.

<text>European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) () is a university located at Frankfurt (Oder) in Brandenburg, Germany. It is also known as the University of Frankfurt (Oder). The city is on the Oder River, which marks the border between Germany and Poland. With 5,200 students — around 1,000 of whom come from Poland — and some 160 teaching staff, the Viadrina is one of Germany&#x27;s smallest universities (only the University of Erfurt and Jacobs University Bremen have fewer students).

The Latin word &quot;Viadrina&quot; means &quot;belonging to, or situated at, the Oder River&quot;; it derives from &quot;Viadrus&quot;, the name of a presumed river god of the Oder. Actually, an ancient name of the river is not documented, it is mentioned as &quot;Oddera&quot; in the 991 &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; referring to the realm of Prince Mieszko I of Poland. The Latin name was probably introduced by the Frankfurt scholar Jodocus Willich (c.1486–1552) and appeared in the &quot;Cosmographia&quot; by Sebastian Münster in 1544; the city of Frankfurt was known in Latin as &quot;Francofortum ad Viadrum&quot;.

== Alma Mater Viadrina (1506–1811) ==

The Alma Mater Viadrina was founded on 26 April 1506 by Elector Joachim I Nestor, with permission from Pope Julius II, as the first principal university of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The foundation stone was laid already in 1498 at the site of a demolished synagogue; a foundation charter was issued by Pope Alexander VI in the same year. The notable theologian Konrad Wimpina (c.1465–1531) became founding prorector. Construction of the main building (&quot;Collegienhaus&quot;) was completed in 1507.

The university was organized into four Faculties of Arts: law, theology, philosophy, and medicine. Within the first year, more than 900 students from all over Germany, Poland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark enrolled. The &quot;Viadrina&quot; enjoyed an excellent reputation in Brandenburg and the surrounding regions, and its graduates had high positions in administration, politics, law and the church.

One of its earliest chancellors, Bishop Georg von Blumenthal (1490–1550) was a vigorous opponent of the Protestant Reformation and did his utmost to expel Lutherans such as Jodocus Willich. (In 2018 his brother&#x27;s direct descendant Julia von Blumenthal was named president of the refounded Viadrina.) In 1518 Johann Tetzel (1465–1519) obtained his doctorate at Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the university, like its Prussian counterpart, the University of Königsberg established in 1544, turned to Lutheran orthodoxy. A professor popular among students, Erdmann Copernicus, was promoted to head of university in 1573, but died in the same year. 

After the ruling House of Hohenzollern had converted to Calvinism, the &#x27;Great Elector&#x27; Frederick William and his governor Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen in 1655 founded the University of Duisburg, a Reformed college in the Duchy of Cleves. 

Frederick William also opened the Frankfurt University for Jewish students, against fierce resistance by the teaching staff. While damages of the Thirty Years&#x27; War still had to be repaired, he had a botanical garden laid out next to the university premises. An anatomical theatre was built in 1684 at the behest of physician Bernhardus Albinus (1653–1721). The complete renovation was accomplished in 1693/94.

In 1736 the eminent jurist Johann Jakob Moser was called to head the Faculty of Law at the university, but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by the Prussian king Frederick William I.

In the course of the Prussian Reforms during the Napoleonic Wars, the University of Frankfurt was moved to Breslau (present-day Wrocław, Poland) in 1811. It merged with the University of Breslau, the &quot;Leopoldina&quot; established in 1702 by the Habsburg emperor Leopold I, in order to be competitive with the newly founded University of Berlin. The merger included the transfer of the comprehensive library stocks, then with more than 28,000 volumes the second-largest in Prussia after the Königsberg State and University Library collection, up the Oder river by boat. Some of the Viadrina professors did, however, accept positions in Berlin.

The old university building was taken over by the City of Frankfurt and turned into a schoolhouse. It was barely damaged in World War II and first used as a home for refugees from the former eastern territories. Afterwards the building stood empty until it was controversially demolished in the early 1960s. Only the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument.

Famous students at the historical Viadrina included the philosopher Ulrich von Hutten (1488–1523) and the theologian and political leader Thomas Müntzer ( 1489–1525), the musician Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714–1788), the physicians Marcus Elieser Bloch (1723–1799) and Johann Gottlieb Walter (1734–1818), Wilhelm (1767–1836) and Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), as well as the poet Heinrich von Kleist (1777–1811). Among the notable university prorectors was Duke Henry Wenceslaus of Oels-Bernstadt (1592–1639) in 1608.

== New Viadrina ==

In 1991 the university was re-established as Viadrina European University. It currently comprises three faculties: Economics and Business Studies; Law; and Cultural Studies. A prime focus of the educational program is to attract students from throughout Europe in order to create a multinational student body. Currently about 40 percent of the students are foreigners (mostly Polish), a greater proportion than at other German universities.

Viadrina European University maintains close cooperation with Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland. The two universities jointly operate the Collegium Polonicum, located just opposite Viadrina on the Polish side of the Oder River.

Notable among the research institutions at Viadrina University is the Frankfurt Institute of Transformational Studies (FIT). The institute is a substantial contributor to research on economies in transition.

The university&#x27;s former president, Professor Gesine Schwan, ran for President of Germany both in 2004 and 2009, being narrowly defeated by Horst Köhler twice.
Former diplomat Gunter Pleuger has served as the university&#x27;s president since 1 October 2008. Pleuger was followed by slavicist Alexander Wöll on 1 October 2014.

<text>Zhang Zuolin (March 19, 1875June 4, 1928) was a Chinese warlord who ruled Manchuria from 1916 to 1928 and led the Fengtian clique, one of the most powerful factions during the Warlord Era. In 1927, he became the leader of the Beiyang government and was declared Generalissimo of the Republic of China.

Born to a poor peasant&#x27;s family in Manchuria, Zhang became a prominent bandit in the region in the 1890s. After the Boxer Rebellion, his troops became a regiment of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s army, and during the Russo-Japanese War, they were hired by the Japanese Army as mercenaries. During the 1911 Revolution, Zhang initially fought against the revolutionaries, and after the foundation of the Republic of China supported the Beiyang government. Zhang founded the Fengtian clique and gradually expanded his Northeastern Army, which established his supremacy over the three northeastern provinces (Fengtian, Jilin and Heilongjiang).

Zhang&#x27;s government in Manchuria initiated important reforms and investments in agriculture and industry, resulting in good development. He was supported by the Japanese, who viewed him as best representing their economic interests. Seeking to extend his power to northern China, Zhang fought wars against the Anhui and Zhili cliques, after which he became the most powerful figure in the Beiyang government and proclaimed himself Generalissimo in 1927. Zhang&#x27;s troops were defeated by the Kuomintang&#x27;s Northern Expedition in 1928. During his retreat, he was assassinated by officers of the Japanese Kwantung Army. He was succeeded in Manchuria by his son, Zhang Xueliang, who recognized the Nationalist government.

== Origins ==
===Early life===

Zhang was born in 1875 in Haicheng (now PanJin), a county in southern Fengtian province (modern Liaoning) in northeastern China, to poor parents. He received little formal education, and the only non-military trade that he learned in his lifetime was a small amount of veterinary science. His grandfather had come to the northeast after fleeing a famine in Zhili (modern Hebei) in 1821. As a child, Zhang was known by the nickname &quot;Pimple.&quot; He spent his early youth hunting, fishing and brawling. He hunted hares in the Manchurian countryside to help feed his family. In appearance he was thin and short.

Zhang asserted that he was a Han Chinese Bannerman.

When he became old enough to work, he got a job at a stable in an inn, where he became familiar with many bandit gangs operating in Manchuria at the time. At the age of twenty, he enlisted as a cavalry soldier to fight in the First Sino–Japanese War (1894–1895). After the end of the war, he returned to his hometown and became a bandit. In one version of his beginnings as a warlord, during a hunting trip he spotted a wounded bandit (&quot;Honghuzi&quot;) on horseback, killed him, took his horse and became a bandit himself. By his late 20s he had formed a small personal army, acquiring something of a Robin Hood reputation. His bandit career was euphemistically referred to as his experience in the &quot;University of the Green Forest&quot;, as he was illiterate. During his time of banditry, he became close with some figures who later occupied important positions in his military clique.

In 1900 the Boxer Rebellion broke out, and Zhang&#x27;s gang joined the imperial army. In peacetime he hired his men out as security escorts for traveling merchants. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 the Japanese Army employed Zhang and his men as mercenaries. At the end of the Qing dynasty Zhang managed to have his men recognised as a regiment of the regular Chinese army, patrolling the borders of Manchuria and suppressing other bandit gangs. The American surgeon Louis Livingston Seaman met Zhang during the Russo-Japanese War, and took several photographs of him and his troops as well as writing an account of his journey.

===Growth of power in Manchuria===
During the 1911 Xinhai Revolution some military commanders wanted to declare independence for Manchuria; but the pro-Manchu governor used Zhang&#x27;s regiment to set up a &quot;Manchurian People&#x27;s Peacekeeping Council&quot;, intimidating would-be rebels and revolutionaries. For his efforts in preventing civil disturbance and revolution, Zhang was named the Vice Minister of Military Affairs.

On January 1, 1912 Sun Yat-sen became the first President of the Republic of China in Nanjing. Yuan Shikai, operating out of Beijing, sent other northern military commanders a series of telegrams, advising them to oppose Sun&#x27;s administration. To gain Zhang&#x27;s loyalty, Yuan sent him a large shipment of military provisions; Zhang sent Yuan an enormous (and costly) ginseng root in return to symbolize their friendship. Zhang then murdered a number of leading figures in his base city of Shenyang (then known as &quot;Mukden&quot;), and was rewarded with a series of impressive-sounding titles by the nearly defunct Qing court. When it became obvious to Zhang that Yuan would usurp control of the central government, he endorsed Yuan&#x27;s rule over that of either Sun or the Manchus. After Zhang put down a rebellion in June 1912, Yuan raised him to the rank of Lieutenant-General. In 1913 Yuan attempted to move Zhang away from Manchuria by having him transferred to Mongolia, but Zhang reminded Yuan of his successful efforts to keep local order, and refused.

In 1915, when it became clear that Yuan intended to declare himself emperor, Zhang was one of the few officials who supported him. Besides political opportunism, Zhang saw Yuan as a central, unifying, and legitimate figure. Furthermore, Yuan had promoted him to military governor of Fengtian to gain his support. Zhang&#x27;s main rival for power in Manchuria, Zhang Xiluan, had been asked about Yuan&#x27;s ambitions, and suggested to Yuan that he &quot;think about it a bit more&quot;, for which Zhang Xiluan was recalled to Beijing while Zhang Zuolin was promoted.

In March 1916, after many southern provinces revolted against Yuan Shikai&#x27;s government, Zhang supported him but expelled a local military governor sent by Duan Qirui to replace him, with some support from local Japanese officers in the Kwantung Army. Beijing accepted Zhang&#x27;s authority and Yuan appointed Zhang superintendent of military affairs in Liaoning (known as &quot;Fengtian&quot; until 1929). After Yuan died in June 1916, the new central government named Zhang both military and civil governor of Liaoning, the essential components of a successful warlord.

Zhang, a pragmatist, had always remained cordial with Puyi, the last Emperor of China, and had sent him a gift of £1,600 for his wedding as a token of loyalty. Zhang sought good relations with Puyi in order to increase his power and cement his legitimacy if a restoration was ever attempted. In 1917 he plotted with Zhang Xun, a Qing-loyalist general, to restore the abdicated Puyi to the throne. Zhang Zuolin proposed talking to the National Assembly about a possible restoration. After Zhang Xun rebelled, Zhang Zuolin remained neutral and actually supported Duan Qirui in suppressing Zhang Xun after it became clear that Duan would win. Zhang was able to absorb soldiers of nearby commanders who had been linked to the rebellion, increasing his own power. He intervened and took control of China&#x27;s northernmost province, Heilongjiang, after a rebellion there forced the local governor to flee. Because the governor of Jilin province had been linked to the attempt to restore the monarchy, Zhang had allies from Jilin successfully agitate for the governor&#x27;s dismissal in Beijing. By 1918 Zhang&#x27;s control of Manchuria was complete, except for the small areas held by the Japanese Empire.

A Tianjin-based honghuzi leader negotiated with Zhang Zuolin.

== Fortress Manchuria ==
In 1920 Zhang was the supreme ruler of Manchuria. The central government acknowledged this by appointing him Governor-General of the Three Eastern Provinces. He began to surround himself in luxury, building a chateau-style home near Shenyang, and had at least five wives (an accepted practice of any powerful or wealthy Chinese at the time). In 1925 his personal fortune was estimated at over 18 million yuan (roughly $2.6 million).

His power rested on the Fengtian Army, which was composed of about 100,000 men in 1922 and almost triple that number by the end of the decade. It had obtained large stocks of weapons left over from World War I and included naval units, an air force and an armaments industry. Zhang integrated a large number of local militias into his army, and thus prevented Manchuria from falling into the chaos which reigned in China proper at the time. Jilin province was ruled by a military governor, who was said to be a cousin of Zhang; Heilongjiang had its own regional warlord, who never displayed any ambitions outside the province.

Although Manchuria officially remained a part of the Republic of China, it became more or less an independent state isolated from China by its geography and protected by the Fengtian Army. The only pass at Shanhaiguan, where the Great Wall meets the sea, could easily be closed. In a time when the central government was barely able to pay the salaries of its civil servants, no more revenues were forwarded to Beijing. In 1922 Zhang took control of the only rail link, the Beijing–Shenyang Railway, north of the Great Wall and also kept tax revenues from this railroad. Only postal and customs revenues continued to be sent to Beijing, because they had been pledged to the victorious foreign powers after the failed Boxer Rebellion of 1900, and Zhang feared their intervention.

It was proposed that Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s domain (the &quot;Three Eastern Provinces&quot;) take Outer Mongolia under its administration by the Bogda Khan and Bodo in 1922 after pro-Soviet Mongolian Communists seized control of Outer Mongolia.

== Japanese and Russian influences ==

Manchuria shared a long border with Russia, which had been weakened militarily after the October Revolution. The line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which was under Russian control, ran through northern Manchuria and the land immediately on either side of the tracks was considered to be Russian territory. From 1917 to about 1924 the new Communist government in Moscow was having such difficulties establishing itself in Siberia that often it was not clear who was in charge of operating the railway on the Russian side. Still, Zhang avoided a showdown and after 1924 the Soviets re-established their dominance over the railroad.

The situation&#x27;s precariousness was demonstrated by an outbreak of pneumonic plague in Hailar, a town at the western end of the Chinese Eastern Railway, in October 1920. Chinese troops were present in great number and turned railway quarantine into a farce. The soldiers freed some of their comrades who had been imprisoned as contacts, and they escaped to the mining town of Dalainor on the Amur River, where a quarter of the population died. In the other direction, all of the towns along the Chinese Eastern Railway as far as Vladivostok were infected. Around 9,000 died, while only a few contacts were able to reach south Manchuria.

The Japanese posed more of a problem. After the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 they had gained two important outposts in south Manchuria: The Kwantung Leased Territory consisted of a peninsula in the southernmost part of Manchuria. It included the ice-free port of Dairen (Chinese: Dalian), which became the main link to Japan. Reaching northward from the colony, the South Manchurian Railway passed through Shenyang (referred to as Mukden by the Japanese), linking up with the Chinese Eastern Railway in Changchun. The land on either side of the railway tracks remained extraterritorial, now being controlled by the Japanese Kwantung Army. This army maintained 7,000-14,000 men in Manchuria, tolerating and being tolerated by the Fengtian Army, although Zhang kept up a war of words, playing on anti-Japanese sentiments in the Chinese public.

Lu Zhankui, a Mongol officer under Zhang, was instrumental in bringing Oomoto leader Onisaburo Deguchi, and Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba, to Mongolia in 1924.

== Civil reform ==

At the beginning of the 1920s, Zhang transformed Manchuria from an unimportant frontier region to one of the most prosperous parts of China. He had inherited a financially weak provincial governmentin 1917 Fengtian faced ten outstanding loans from foreign-controlled consortia and banks totaling over 12 million yuan. Zhang chose Wang Yongjiang, who had served as head of a regional tax office, for the task of solving Fengtian&#x27;s financial problems. He was appointed director of the bureau of finance.

A number of currencies were circulating in the province, as was the custom in China, and the paper notes issued by the provincial government had experienced a steady depreciation in value. Wang decided to switch to a silver standard and set the initial value of the new silver yuan equal to the Japanese gold yen, which was accepted throughout Korea and Manchuria. Much to the surprise of the Chinese, the new currency even gained in value against the gold yen, although Japanese businessmen claimed that it was not backed up by sufficient silver reserves. Wang then used the newly gained credibility to introduce another note, the Fengtian dollar, which was not convertible into silver anymore. However, it was accepted by the government for the payment of taxes, a sign of faith in its own currency.

Next, Wang turned to the chaotic tax collecting system. Because of his former job, he was well acquainted with the abuses of the system and introduced a number of controls. The provincial government had also invested government funds in various enterprises, many of which were poorly managed. Wang ordered a review of government-sponsored firms. From 1918, revenues rose steadily, and by 1921 all outstanding loans had been repaid and there was even a budget surplus. Wang was rewarded by being appointed Civil Governor of Fengtian province while remaining director of the bureau of finance. He retained the title of Military Governor of Fengtian. Still, more than two-thirds of the budget was allocated to the military.

== Internal strife ==


In 1919 France had left Renault FT tanks in Vladivostok after the joint Allied intervention, and Zhang Zuolin soon incorporated them into the Manchurian Army.

In the summer of 1920, Zhang made a foray into North China on the other side of the Great Wall, trying to topple Duan Qirui, the leading warlord of Beijing. He did this by supporting another warlord, Cao Kun, with troops and they successfully ousted Duan. As a reward, Zhang was granted control over most of Inner Mongolia to the west of Manchuria.

In December 1921, Zhang visited Beijing; at his request, the entire cabinet, led by Jin Yunpeng, resigned, leaving him free to appoint a new government. Installing Liang Shiyi as premier, he proposed a new constitution and the resolution of the republic&#x27;s financial difficulties. Now a figure of national prominence, he quickly came into conflict with Wu Peifu, a divisional commander of the North China Zhili clique, which was based in the province of Zhili that surrounded Beijing.

In the spring of 1922, Zhang personally took the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Fengtian Army, and on April 19 his forces entered China proper. As his men took Beijing three days later, fighting soon broke out. On May 4, the Fengtian Army was seriously defeated by the Zhili Army in what came to be known as the First Zhili–Fengtian War. Three-thousand troops had been killed and 7,000 wounded, and Zhang&#x27;s units retreated to Shanhai Pass. Zhili forces were in control of Beijing and Zhang&#x27;s image as a national leader had been destroyed and he reacted by declaring Manchuria independent from Beijing in May 1922.

On June 22, Wang left Shenyang for Japanese-controlled Dalian, allegedly for treatment of an eye infection. From there he challenged Zhang by demanding restrictions to military spending and complete control over civil affairs. Zhang gave in, lifted martial law and agreed to a separation of civil and military administration in all of the three provinces. Wang returned on August 6, thereby ensuring Manchuria&#x27;s continued stability.

== Regional development ==

In the following years Wang realized a far-reaching development plan. He tried to bring more workers into the booming Manchurian economy. Most had come on a temporary basis, returning to their homes in North China in winter. The Manchurian government now encouraged them to bring women and children, and settle permanently. As an incentive, they were made eligible for reduced fares on all Chinese-owned railways in Manchuria, received funds to build dwellings and were promised total ownership after five years of continuous occupation. Rent for the land was canceled for the first years. Most were sent to the interior of Manchuria, where they reclaimed land for agriculture, or worked in forestry or mines. Between 1924 and 1929 the amount of land under tillage increased from to .

Manchuria&#x27;s economy boomed while chaos and uncertainty reigned in the rest of China. An especially ambitious project was to break the Japanese monopoly on cotton textiles by creating a large mill which, much to Japan&#x27;s sorrow, succeeded. The government also invested in other enterprises, among them quite a number of Sino-Japanese companies. During this time, the Fengtian Army successfully repressed Manchuria&#x27;s many bandits. Various railway lines were built, among them the Shenyang-Hailong line, which opened in 1925. In 1924 Wang amalgamated three regional banks into the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, and became its general director. By this he tried to create a development bank and at the same time keep accurate records of military spending.

== Beginning of the end ==

After the disastrous defeat of 1922, Zhang had reorganized his Fengtian Army, started a training program, and bought new equipment, including mobile radios and machine guns. In the autumn of 1924, fighting broke out again in Central China. Zhang saw an opportunity to capture North China and Beijing and become head of the central government. While most other warlord armies fought along the Yangtze River, Zhang attacked North China, thus beginning the Second Zhili–Fengtian War.

In a surprise move, a Zhili commander, Feng Yuxiang, toppled Cao Kun and took control of Beijing. He shared power with Zhang, and both appointed the same Duan Qirui whom he had ousted in 1920. Zhang purchased 14 more FT tanks in 1924 and 1925 for the army, and they were used in the battles.

By August 1925, the Fengtian Army controlled four large provinces within the Great Wall — Zhili (where Beijing was located but not Beijing itself), Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui. One unit even marched as far south as the city of Shanghai. However, the military situation was so unstable that Sun Chuanfang, a Zhili clique warlord whose sphere of influence extended along the Yangtze, managed to push back the Fengtian Army again. By November, Zhang held only a small corner of north China, including a corridor connecting Beijing with Manchuria. Attacks on Beijing continued into the spring of 1926.

Manchuria was placed under martial law again, and its economy disintegrated under the burden of the insatiable war machine. Old taxes were increased and new taxes invented. Zhang demanded that more paper money be printed, out of step with silver reserves. An extremely serious crisis erupted in November 1925, when Guo Songling revolted and ordered his troops to turn back and march on Shenyang. The Japanese brought in reinforcements to protect their interests in Manchuria, but Zhang managed to put down the revolt in December. Even more seriously, Wang Yongjiang, now the civil governor of Manchuria, realized that his work of nine years had been in vain. He left Shenyang in February 1926 and resigned. Before his death from kidney failure on November 1, 1927, Wang, totally disillusioned, did not reply when Zhang asked him to return. Instead, Wang severed all connections with Zhang.
== Final years ==

With the loss of his financial expert, Zhang took drastic action. In March 1926 he appointed a new governor, whose only job was to supply the Fengtian Army with large amounts of money. He issued new provincial bonds and forced businesses and local communities to purchase them. (Early in 1927, he even entered into the opium trade by selling expensive licenses for the sale and use of opium.) Bank reserves and railway revenues were plundered, and ever more paper notes were issued. The best indicator of Manchuria&#x27;s economic decline was the value of the Fengtian dollar (yuan), which had started on parity with the Japanese gold yen, but by February 1928, 40 yuan was equivalent to 1 gold yen. In the winter of 1926, Manchuria&#x27;s economy collapsed. Workers went on strike, and hungry immigrants flooded back into Shenyang because they could not find any work.

Zhang provided weapons to anti-Guominjun Muslim rebels led by Ma Tingrang during the Muslim conflict in Gansu (1927–30).

In June 1926, Zhang managed to capture Beijing, and rumors swirled that he was planning to proclaim himself emperor. Instead, a year later, with Kuomintang forces rapidly closing in, he combined his military forces with those of the other warlords, including Zhang Zongchang and Sun Chuanfang, into the National Pacification Army and fought against the Northern Expedition. At the same time, he proclaimed himself Generalissimo of the Republic of China, and thus led China&#x27;s internationally recognized government as a dictator. However, the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek attacked his forces, and in May 1928, the Fengtian Army had to retreat towards Beijing. In addition, Japan applied pressure on Zhang to leave Beijing and to return to Manchuria and underscored that by bringing reinforcements to Tianjin. Zhang left Beijing on June 3, 1928.

The next morning, his train reached the outskirts of Shenyang. Here the line passed through the Japanese-operated South Manchuria Railroad.

=== Assassination ===
In what came to be known as the Huanggutun incident, Colonel Kōmoto Daisaku, an officer of the Japanese Kwantung Army, planted a bomb along a railroad bridge, which exploded when Zhang&#x27;s train passed it; mortally wounded, Zhang died a few days later. At the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in 1946, Okada Keisuke testified that Zhang was murdered because the Kwantung Army was infuriated by his failure to stop Chiang&#x27;s army, which was backed by Moscow, Tokyo&#x27;s strategic rival. For two weeks, Zhang&#x27;s death was kept secret while the scramble for power was decided. That is why according to an announcement issued by the Fengtian Army, he officially died on June 21, 1928.

Zhang was succeeded, both as warlord of Manchuria and head of the now-exiled Beiyang Government, by his eldest son, Zhang Xueliang, the so-called &quot;Young Marshal.&quot; The government-in-exile would not last very long since by July, Beiyang had reached an armistice with the Kuomintang; and by the end of the year, the Northeast Flag Replacement occurred, nominally reunifying China under the Kuomintang banner.

== Personal life ==
Zhang had six wives and 14 children (eight sons and six daughters), among which include his son and successor, Zhang Xueliang, as well as Zhang Xueming. He was a Buddhist.

A pragmatist, Zhang supported different movements depending on what would gain him the most power and legitimacy, and even supported the restoration of the Qing dynasty in 1917. His nicknames include the &quot;Old Marshal&quot; (大帥, P: &quot;Dàshuài&quot;, W: &quot;Ta-shuai&quot;), &quot;Rain Marshal&quot; (雨帥, P: &quot;Yǔshuài&quot;, W: &quot;Yü-shuai&quot;) and &quot;Mukden Tiger&quot;. The American press referred to him as &quot;Marshal Chang Tso-lin, Tuchun of Manchuria&quot;.

== In the media ==
There are numerous movies, TV shows and radio shows depicting the life of Zhang Zuolin, including:

* &quot;The Heroes of Troubled Times (乱世枭雄)&quot;, is a 485 episode radio show read by the famous story teller/actor Dan Tianfang 单田芳, about Zhang Zuolin.
* &quot;Young Marshal (少帅)&quot;, is a 48 episode TV show about both Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang, originally aired in 2015.
* &quot;Legend of the Old Marshal (大帅传奇)&quot;, is a 20 episode TV show about Zhang Zuolin, originally aired in 1994.

<text>Jari Olavi Litmanen (; born 20 February 1971) is a Finnish former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or a second striker. He was the first-choice captain of the Finland national team between 1996 and 2008 in an international career that ran from 1989 to 2010. Litmanen is widely considered to be Finland&#x27;s greatest football player of all time. He was chosen as the best Finnish player of the last 50 years by the Football Association of Finland in the UEFA Jubilee Awards in November 2003. He also finished 42nd in the 100 Greatest Finns voting in 2004. The Association of Football Statisticians&#x27; (The AFS) compendium of &#x27;Greatest Ever Footballers&#x27; listed Litmanen as the 53rd best footballer ever.

In Finland, he is often called &quot;Litti&quot; (after his own surname), which dates from his early years, and is also known as &quot;Kuningas&quot; (&quot;The King&quot;).

During his club career, Litmanen represented Reipas, HJK, MyPa and Lahti in Finland, and Ajax, Barcelona, Liverpool, Hansa Rostock and Malmö FF abroad. Once considered one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, he became the first Finnish footballing superstar while playing for Ajax in the mid-1990s, winning the Champions League in 1995, the peak year of his career.

His later career was marred by injuries, and he was unable to repeat the success of his Ajax years either at Barcelona or Liverpool, often finding himself on the bench, despite some impressive performances for the latter. Writing about Litmanen in 2009, Paul Simpson, former &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; editor, went as far as to assert that &quot;his career has not been worthy of his talent&quot;.

== Club career ==

=== Early career in Finland ===
Litmanen made his first-team debut for Reipas in Finland&#x27;s then top division Mestaruussarja at the age of 16 in 1987. After four seasons with Reipas, he moved to HJK, Finland&#x27;s biggest club, in 1991. A year later, he joined MyPa, where he was coached by Harri Kampman, who later introduced him to his agent, the late Heikki Marttinen. Litmanen did not win any medals in the Finnish league, but he did win the Finnish Cup with MyPa in July 1992 in a 2–0 win over FF Jaro in the final at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. His performance in the cup final, including a goal, convinced a scout of Ajax that the club should sign him. &quot;For me, he was the player,&quot; the scout later told Finnish television. His transfer took place during the same summer, and he did not complete the Finnish football season with MyPa.

Louis Van Gaal, the manager of Ajax at the time, later stated that Ajax paid a transfer fee of only £10,000 for Litmanen. However, the original fax document was later revealed in Finnish media, according to which the transfer fee was 100,000 + 800,000 Dutch guilder, which corresponds roughly to €550,000.

=== Ajax ===
Before his move to Ajax, Litmanen had failed to earn a contract with the Romanian club Dinamo București. A number of European clubs, including Barcelona, Leeds United and PSV, had shown an interest in him, but in the end it was Ajax that bought him.

David Endt, who was Ajax team manager in the 1990s, described his first impression of Litmanen to the Finnish broadcasting corporation YLE in 2010:
During 1992–93, his first season at Ajax, he played mostly in the reserves. Then Ajax manager Louis van Gaal was apparently not overly impressed with him, but the team physiotherapist suggested using him as a stand-in for Dennis Bergkamp, who was injured at the time. Van Gaal liked what he saw, and knowing that Bergkamp was about to leave for Inter, he announced that Litmanen would be Bergkamp&#x27;s successor, something that people in Litmanen&#x27;s native Finland found difficult to believe. This turned out to be true, however, and he inherited from Bergkamp the famous number 10 shirt, which is often given to playmakers. He went on to score 26 goals in the 1993–94 season, becoming the league&#x27;s top scorer, and leading Ajax to the title. He was also voted Footballer of the Year in the Netherlands in 1993.

Litmanen was one of the star players of Van Gaal&#x27;s team that won three consecutive Dutch championships and reached the UEFA Champions League final twice in a row. From the beginning of the 1994–95 season to the middle of the 1995–96 season, Ajax went undefeated in both the Eredivisie (a run of 52 games) and the Champions League (19 games). When Ajax beat Milan in the 1995 Champions League final, Litmanen became the first Finnish player to win the Champions League. In the 1995–96 edition of the Champions League, he was the Champions League top scorer with nine goals, including the equaliser in the final against Juventus, which Ajax lost on penalties. In 1995, he also won the Intercontinental Cup against Grêmio and came third in the voting for the Ballon d&#x27;Or (European Footballer of the Year), having finished eighth the previous year.

Litmanen spent seven years in Amsterdam, winning four Dutch championships and three KNVB Cups, and scored a total of 129 goals, 91 of them in the league. He is the club&#x27;s top scorer in European competition with 26 goals in 54 matches (including two goals scored in the 2002–03 season). Litmanen has the honour of being one of just three players presented in a special video featurette at the Ajax Museum. The other two are Marco van Basten and Johan Cruyff. Frank Rijkaard, Litmanen&#x27;s teammate in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, once said, &quot;Dennis Bergkamp was brilliant for Ajax but the best No.10 we ever had was Jari.&quot; In his time at Ajax, some fans called him &quot;Merlin&quot; because of the magic he brought to the pitch.

But his proneness to injury also earned Litmanen the name &quot;The Man of Glass&quot;, and injuries hampered his later seasons at Ajax causing him to miss many games (in his six seasons as a regular first-team player, he missed 57 out of a total of 204 league games, and in his last three seasons, he missed seven out of 24 European matches, playing only part of five others). His injury problems were to worsen as time passed, undermining his subsequent career.

=== Barcelona ===
In 1999, Litmanen was reunited with Louis van Gaal at Barcelona, one of several former Ajax players recruited by Van Gaal in his time as manager. Litmanen&#x27;s stint with the club was largely plagued by injuries. An article in &quot;The Observer&quot; in April 2000 likened him to Pope John Paul II, in that he was &quot;making few appearances and looking more frail each time&quot;.

Litmanen also failed to adapt to his new conditions, and he was one of the players dropped by Van Gaal that winter. Van Gaal later expressed his disappointment with Litmanen at Barcelona:

After an unsuccessful season, Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, and Litmanen was frozen out of the team, losing the number 10 shirt to Rivaldo, although he remained at the club until January 2001, when he moved to Liverpool on a free transfer.

=== Liverpool ===
&quot;We have signed a world-class player. He comes with a massive reputation and I believe he&#x27;s one of the most exciting signings we have made,&quot; said Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier after the transfer had been completed. Litmanen also expressed his pleasure with the move: &quot;It has always been my dream to play for Liverpool. I have supported them since I was a child and there has been talk about me joining them before.&quot; He wanted to wear the number seven shirt as worn by his boyhood hero Kenny Dalglish, but this had already been taken by Vladimír Šmicer. As shirt numbers 17 and 27 were also in use, he settled for the number 37.

Litmanen made a good start at Liverpool but broke his wrist playing for Finland against England at Anfield in late March 2001 and missed the rest of the season. Although he was part of the Liverpool team that won the treble of the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001, he missed all three finals because of injury. The following season, he was used sparingly by Houllier but did score goals against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Fulham in the Premier League and against Dynamo Kyiv, Roma and Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League.

According to his profile on LFCHistory.net, &quot;Litmanen had difficulties in training due to his ankle problems and was hardly able to play for ninety minutes week in and week out.&quot; Litmanen himself was frustrated by his lack of playing time at Liverpool:

Litmanen was again given permission to move clubs for free after the 2001–02 season, having scored a total of 9 goals in 43 official matches during his one and a half seasons at the club.

=== Return to Ajax ===
Litmanen decided to return to Ajax, and was given a hero&#x27;s welcome with the crowd again singing his name. He was one of the key players as Ajax reached the quarter-finals of the 2002–03 Champions League, but he continued to be plagued by injuries, and much of the following season was once again spent on the sidelines. In the spring of 2004, the club released him from his contract.

=== Lahti and Hansa Rostock ===
Litmanen&#x27;s return to Finland, where he joined Lahti, was much hyped and was hailed as &quot;the return of the king&quot;. Litmanen, however, moved to German Bundesliga strugglers Hansa Rostock in January 2005, but he was unable to prevent them being relegated, which ended his stint at the club.

=== Malmö FF ===
Litmanen joined the Swedish club Malmö FF in July 2005 in an attempt to help them qualify for the Champions League. This attempt, however, failed, and Litmanen himself was injured during the whole of the autumn, only making a few appearances. He decided to continue his career with Malmö in 2006 but was again sidelined with a number of injuries for much of the season. However, the matches he did play showed he remained a brilliant player when fit. After an operation to repair a damaged ankle during the winter break, Malmö decided to extend his contract over the 2007 season, but an ankle injury suffered in June 2007 forced Litmanen to cancel it.

=== Fulham ===
In January 2008, Litmanen received a ten-day trial invitation from Fulham under former Finland manager Roy Hodgson, and was signed on 31 January 2008 together with fellow countryman Toni Kallio. Just weeks after signing with Fulham, Litmanen had to return to his native Finland to rest, after serious heart concerns.

Litmanen eventually made his debut for Fulham in a reserve-team match against Tottenham on 31 March 2008, but he was released in May of the same year without playing a single game for the first team.

=== Return to Lahti ===
On 8 August 2008, it was announced that Litmanen would join his former club Lahti of the Finnish Premier Division for the remainder of the 2008 season. Although he only played 34 minutes in his first match, he scored twice and provided the passes for two other goals. He played an important role in helping Lahti to finish third in the league and qualify for Europe for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. He signed a new one-year contract with Lahti on 16 April 2009. Litmanen scored his first European goal for Lahti in a 2–0 win against Gorica in the second qualifying round of the Europa League, with the final aggregate score being 2–1. This was his 30th goal in 83 European matches. On 18 September 2010, he scored a bicycle kick goal against Oulu in a 2–1 away victory.

On 23 October 2010, he scored his 50th Veikkausliiga goal, but this happened in a 3–2 defeat against TPS and didn&#x27;t stop the club from being relegated to Ykkönen.

=== Return to HJK ===
On 20 April 2011, Litmanen signed a one-year contract with the reigning Finnish champions HJK at age 40, making him one of the few footballers to play at professional level in four different decades (1980s–2010s). He usually started as a substitute and played for 10–30 minutes. The HJK coach Antti Muurinen described Litmanen as something akin to a &quot;precision munition&quot; for HJK. He played in this role on 24 September 2011 in the Finnish Cup final against KuPS, coming on in the 80th minute when the score was 0–0. During the second half of extra time, he scored a spectacular half volley to make it 1–0 to HJK in the 108th minute. They went on to win the match 2–1. This was Litmanen&#x27;s first Finnish Cup final after winning it with MyPa in 1992.

On 2 October 2011, HJK secured their third consecutive Finnish championship, thus winning the Double. As of that day, Litmanen had played 18 matches for HJK that season, and they had won every single match in which he had been on the field. On 14 October 2011, this run ended when HJK drew 0–0 with JJK Jyväskylä.

On 29 October 2011, Litmanen celebrated his 200th league match by giving three assists in HJK&#x27;s 5–2 home win over Haka. It was also his last game of the season and would prove to be the last of his professional career.

== International career ==

Litmanen is Finland&#x27;s most capped player and was Finland&#x27;s leading goalscorer until 12 October 2021, when Teemu Pukki broke the record with two goals against Kazakhstan in a World Cup qualifier. His international career ran for 21 years from 1989 to 2010.

Litmanen made his Finland debut on 22 October 1989 against Trinidad and Tobago, and scored his first goal on 16 May 1991 against Malta. Litmanen served as Finland&#x27;s captain from 1996 to 2008, and was arguably their key player for more than a decade, helping the team to many unexpected victories against higher ranked opposition.

Litmanen earned his 100th cap on 25 January 2006 against South Korea, one of only four Finns to have reached such a milestone, the others being Ari Hjelm, Sami Hyypiä and Jonatan Johansson.

When he played for Finland against South Korea on 19 January 2010, Litmanen became one of a handful of male players to represent a national team in four different decades, a feat matched by Andorra&#x27;s Ildefons Lima in June 2021.

On 17 November 2010, Litmanen became the oldest player ever to score for Finland – and also the oldest player overall to score a goal in the qualifying stages for the UEFA European Championship – when he netted a penalty in an 8–0 win over San Marino, which proved to be his last international match.

== Later career ==
In February 2011, the sports news programme Urheiluruutu of the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE interviewed two of Litmanen&#x27;s former teammates about the possibility of his working for Ajax when he decides to end his playing career. Former Ajax captain Danny Blind said the following:
Michel Kreek of the Ajax Academy was equally positive about this possibility: 

He served as a TV pundit for YLE during Euro 1992, Euro 2012, World Cup 2014 and Euro 2016, and, during the latter, also wrote comment and analysis for the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat.

Jari Litmanen has confirmed in his autobiography that his professional career is over. He played his last professional game in 2011.

== Personal life ==
Litmanen was born into a footballing family. His father, Olavi Litmanen, was also a Finnish international and a Reipas player. His mother also played for Reipas at the women&#x27;s highest level.

Litmanen became a father in November 2005 when his Estonian girlfriend Ly Jürgenson gave birth to a son named Caro. The couple&#x27;s second son, Bruno, was born in September 2007. Although they avoid too much publicity, they are sometimes seen together in public.

On 10 October 2010, Litmanen became the first Finnish team sport player to be honoured with a statue: it stands at Kisapuisto (Lahti) where he started his career in the 1970s. &quot;The King – Jari Litmanen&quot; is a 2012 documentary film about Litmanen&#x27;s career.

On 11 May 2020, Litmanen said to Unibet that his coronavirus test was positive, and he had been recovering for four weeks. He said of this time that &quot;I&#x27;ve probably never been in such bad shape&quot;.

<text>SNFU was a Canadian hardcore punk band formed in Edmonton in 1981, relocated to Vancouver in 1992, and disbanded in 2018. They released eight albums, two live records, and one compilation amid many lineup changes and several temporary breakups. Vocalist Ken Chinn (credited as Mr. Chi Pig) led the group, which included twin-brother guitarists Brent and Marc Belke for much of its career.

With founding drummer Evan C. Jones and early bassist Jimmy Schmitz, SNFU built an international audience through dynamic melodic hardcore punk as evident on their debut, &quot;...And No One Else Wanted to Play&quot; (1985). They grew in popularity following the experimental &quot;If You Swear, You&#x27;ll Catch No Fish&quot; (1986) with bassist Dave Bacon and drummer Jon Card, and the aggressive &quot;Better Than a Stick in the Eye&quot; (1988) with bassist Curtis Creager and drummer Ted Simm. They disbanded in 1989, however, due to internal tensions.

SNFU reformed in 1991, beginning with a reunion tour intended as a one-off. Drummer Dave Rees and bassist Rob Johnson ultimately completed their most lasting lineup. They signed with indie label Epitaph Records, releasing &quot;Something Green and Leafy This Way Comes&quot; (1993), &quot;The One Voted Most Likely to Succeed&quot; (1995), and &quot;FYULABA&quot; (1996). These achieved six-digit record sales as the band toured in support of Green Day and Bad Religion.

After leaving Epitaph, the band lost Brent Belke and Rees in 1998 and Johnson in 2001. Following a two-year hiatus, they self-released the critically praised &quot;In the Meantime and In Between Time&quot; (2004) with bassist Matt Warhurst and guest drummer Trevor MacGregor. They again disbanded in 2005, with Marc Belke permanently departing.

Chinn and former member Ken Fleming reformed SNFU in 2007. With a lineup including Card, guitarist Sean Colig, and bassist Kerry Cyr, they released &quot;Never Trouble Trouble Until Trouble Troubles You&quot; (2013). Beginning in 2014, the band included Chinn, Bacon, guitarists Randy Steffes and Kurt Robertson, and several drummers. They went on hiatus in March 2018, and Chinn died on July 16, 2020.

The band became a formative influence on the skate punk subgenre. Rankings of the best Canadian music have included their work.

==History==

===Early years, &quot;...And No One Else Wanted to Play&quot; (1981–1985)===
Ken Chinn met twin brothers Brent and Marc Belke in Edmonton in the late 1970s. The three were teenagers who shared interests in the skateboarding subculture and burgeoning punk rock movement. They formed the punk band Live Sex Shows with drummer Ed Dobek and bassist Phil Larson in 1981, which broke up later that year after a few gigs.

Chinn and the Belkes began a new group, Society&#x27;s No Fucking Use, shortened to Society&#x27;s NFU. Bassist Warren Bidlock and drummer Evan C. Jones completed the initial lineup. After a few months of gigging, Bidlock departed due to stage fright. The group recorded a two-song demo cassette, &quot;Life of a Bag Lady&quot;, with guest bassist Scott Juskiw.

Jimmy Schmitz replaced Bidlock late in 1982, and the group adopted the SNFU moniker. Two studio tracks on the &quot;It Came From Inner Space&quot; compilation LP on Rubber Records followed early in 1983 (songs re-released in 1990 on the &quot;Real Men Don&#x27;t Watch Quincy&quot; bootleg 7-inch). SNFU built an audience throughout North America via their aggressive live set, support of touring acts such as Youth Brigade, the Dead Kennedys, Dayglo Abortions and GBH, and the track &quot;Victims of the Womanizer&quot; on US label BYO Records&#x27; &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; compilation LP.

They recorded their debut album, &quot;...And No One Else Wanted to Play&quot;, in Los Angeles late in 1984, which BYO released the following year. The album made an impact in the underground punk scene, with noted artist Pushead writing in &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; that the band&#x27;s &quot;[r]igorous energy push[es] the limits of power with knocking flurry and extreme excitement.&quot; Pushead concluded that the album was &quot;a scorcher.&quot;

===&quot;If You Swear, You&#x27;ll Catch No Fish&quot; and &quot;Better Than a Stick in the Eye&quot; (1985–1989)===
Jones left the band due to exhaustion in mid 1985, and Schmitz departed in May. Dave Bacon joined as bassist, while Jon Card (previously of Personality Crisis, and later of D.O.A and the Subhumans) moved to Edmonton and joined as drummer. With the new lineup, the group toured North America. They released the comparatively experimental album &quot;If You Swear, You&#x27;ll Catch No Fish&quot; in 1986 via BYO. Card left the band after the album&#x27;s completion. With drummer Ted Simm, SNFU self-released the &quot;She&#x27;s Not on the Menu&quot; 7-inch EP, which also included the &quot;Life of a Bag Lady&quot; recordings from 1982. Bacon departed in early 1987 due to musical differences and health concerns. Curtis Creager (of Urban Holiday), a former roommate of Chinn and Marc Belke, replaced him.

The band&#x27;s popularity steadily increased. &quot;Flipside&quot; fanzine voted them Best Live Band in 1987 over the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fugazi. Metallica included photos of lead singer James Hetfield wearing SNFU&#x27;s iconic &#x27;zombie&#x27; T-shirt in their &quot;The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot;. SNFU toured alongside Voivod and the Dayglo Abortions, and signed to Cargo Records. Cecil English produced their third record, &quot;Better Than a Stick in the Eye&quot;, which was issued in 1988 and remains influential among hardcore punk audiences. The supporting tour included the group&#x27;s first trip to Europe.

Due to internal tensions and musical differences, they disbanded in late 1989. Simm returned to Winnipeg, while the Belkes and Creager formed the Wheat Chiefs (which the Belkes would keep active until 1998). Chinn moved to Vancouver and led The Wongs and Little Joe, both short-lived. Chinn also became open about his homosexuality, thereafter being an advocate for queer identity.

===Reformation, Epitaph years (1991–1998)===
To satisfy their contract with Cargo, in 1991 SNFU released &quot;The Last of the Big Time Suspenders&quot;, comprising live, demo, and studio-outtake tracks. The Belkes, Chinn, Creager, and Card reformed the band, initially planning only a supporting promotional tour. The tour was successful, however, and they reactivated the band several months later.

The Belkes joined Chinn, Card, and new bassist Ken Fleming (formerly of the Winnipeg-based skate punk band The Unwanted) in Vancouver in June 1992. But Card suffered from substance abuse problems, and Dave Rees (formerly of the Wheat Chiefs and SNFU tour mates Broken Smile) replaced him in October. This lineup completed an extensive European tour. The members dismissed Fleming late that year due to personality conflicts; Wheat Chiefs bassist Rob Johnson joined thereafter.

In 1993, the band signed a three-record deal with Epitaph Records, an independent label on the cusp of mainstream success through The Offspring and Rancid. SNFU entered a period of heavy activity. They released two demos for their next album as the &quot;Beautiful, Unlike You and I&quot; EP on Hom Wreckerds Music. The album, &quot;Something Green and Leafy This Way Comes&quot;, appeared in 1993. Their music from this era was increasingly melodic, influenced by new directions in third-wave punk that they themselves helped to develop. They toured with Green Day and Bad Religion and received opening support from Korn and Tool.

In 1995, the band released &quot;The One Voted Most Likely to Succeed&quot;. They hoped the record would succeed comparably to other third-wave punk albums, but it did not chart. Nonetheless, critics acknowledge it as a &quot;classic of &#x27;90s punk&quot; in which the veteran musicians &quot;handle the record&#x27;s more difficult material with grace and power.&quot; The band released the Dave Ogilvie-produced follow-up &quot;FYULABA&quot; in 1996, which received mixed reviews.

Epitaph did not renew the band&#x27;s contract after it expired late in 1997. As a stopgap, SNFU issued &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Right the First Time&quot;, a faux-live album co-released by Megaforce Records and their own Rake Records. In March 1998, Rees and Brent Belke both departed to pursue careers in film and television.

===As four-piece, &quot;In the Meantime and In-Between Time&quot; (1998–2005)===
Despite industry frustrations and lost members, Chinn, Johnson, and Marc Belke opted to continue. Drummer Sean Stubbs (of Numb, Jakalope, and Bif Naked&#x27;s band) completed their first four-piece lineup. They continued to tour and began sporadic work on a new record, which would ultimately take six years. Chris Thompson (known as Corporal Ninny) replaced Stubbs in 1999. They released &quot;The Ping Pong EP&quot;, comprising five &quot;FYULABA&quot; outtakes, in 2000 via Alternative Tentacles. The band also recorded sessions with guest drummer Trevor MacGregor (of Treble Charger), later to appear on their seventh studio album.

In June 2001, Johnson left after a nine-year tenure. Matt Warhurst (of Ocean 3 and Jakalope) replaced him for a single gig, until Thompson departed and the band began a hiatus that would ultimately last two years. During the hiatus, Belke led Based On a True Story, also with Warhurst, before relocating to Toronto. Chinn formed Slaveco. with Warhurst and several musicians from Ocean 3 and Based On a True Story.

SNFU resumed in May 2003 with Marc Belke, Chinn, MacGregor, Warhurst, and producer Pete Wonsiak completing the new record. Rake Records released the album, &quot;In the Meantime and In Between Time&quot;, the following year. Critics heralded it as a return to form, with some ranking it among their finest work. The song &quot;Cockatoo Quill&quot; placed among the top 20 most beloved Canadian songs in a 2017 CBC Music poll. Shane Smith (of Ocean 3, Based On a True Story, and Slaveco.) joined for touring in support of the album.

In August 2005, the group again disbanded due to industry frustrations and internal tensions. Belke began working in radio, hosting his own show. Chinn&#x27;s severe health problems escalated, and he became homeless for a time before entering into assisted living.

===Second reformation, &quot;Never Trouble Trouble Until Trouble Troubles You&quot; (2007–2013)===

In July 2007, Chinn and Fleming planned to play a set of SNFU songs as &quot;asSNFU&quot; at SNFU&#x27;s 25th anniversary party. With Fleming on guitar, they recruited bassist Bryan McCallum (of Karen Foster) and drummer Chad Mareels (of Fleming&#x27;s Dog Eat Dogma). asSNFU played a small handful of concerts thereafter before dropping the &quot;as&quot; prefix and billing themselves as simply &quot;SNFU.&quot; The continuation in the absence of Belke caused minor controversy; but Chinn stated, &quot;As far as I’m concerned it’s SNFU. The band has changed all throughout the years, and this is just another change. [...] Those songs are my life. I’ll fucking play them ‘til I die.&quot; Denis Nowoselski replaced McCallum in 2008, and Smith later returned to replace Mareels. The group embarked on their heaviest activity since the Epitaph years, which included Canadian and European tours.

&quot;Open Your Mouth and Say... Mr. Chi Pig&quot;, a documentary film about Chinn, debuted in March 2010. Produced by the Canadian company Prairie Coast Films and directed by Sean Patrick Shaul, it focused on Chinn, including his drug abuse and schizophrenia. It featured interviews with Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, Brendan Canning of Broken Social Scene, Corb Lund of the Corb Lund and the Hurtin&#x27; Albertans and The Smalls, and Joey Keithley of D.O.A. In April, Jon Card joined the band for a third time, replacing Smith. Shortly thereafter, they completed their first five-piece lineup in 12 years by adding guitarist and vocalist Sean Colig (of Minority, Savannah, and SideSixtySeven).

Chinn&#x27;s severe case of pneumonia led many 2011 dates to be canceled. The group nonetheless remained active, composing its first new material since reforming. Punk historian and author Chris Walter released an official biography of the band, &quot;What No One Else Wanted to Say&quot;, via GFY Press. Bassist Kerry Cyr (of SideSixtySeven) replaced Nowoselski in 2012. The cover song &quot;I Wanna Be an East Indian&quot; appeared under the SNFU moniker on Cruzar Media&#x27;s Dayglo Abortions tribute album, but the track featured only Chinn and unrelated backing musicians.

Cruzar Media announced a September release for SNFU&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Never Trouble Trouble Until Trouble Troubles You&quot;, but delays followed. The band embarked upon its first tour of Japan and a subsequent Canadian tour, with guest drummer Junior Kittlitz replacing the ailing Card. Ultimately released in November, it was their first record in nine years and only without Marc Belke. It received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom praised the new lineup&#x27;s successful approximation of the group&#x27;s previous work. Others were critical, questioning Chinn&#x27;s ability to continue performing. SNFU splintered late in 2013, as all members other than Chinn departed after the supporting tours.

===Final lineups (2014–2018)===
Between lineups, Cruzar issued &quot;I Wanna Be an East Indian&quot; as a download single. Chinn and returning bassist Bacon assembled a new incarnation in February with guitarists Kurt Robertson (of The Real McKenzies) and Randy Steffes (a former sound engineer and road manager for SNFU, The Real McKenzies, and Green Day), and drummer Adrian White (of Strapping Young Lad and Front Line Assembly). Beginning in April, the band played in Europe, Canada, and made their first United States appearances since 2001. They returned to Europe in July with British drummer Jamie Oliver (of the U.K. Subs). Guest drummer Txutxo Krueger (of Total Chaos) also filled in for several dates.

They planned further Canadian touring for November, which would include returning Creager and Simm, but ultimately canceled the tour. With Bacon and Oliver, their 2015 Canadian performances included &quot;...And No One Else Wanted to Play&quot; in its entirety to commemorate its 30th anniversary. They also performed in Australia and New Zealand for the first time since 1997. Basque drummer Batikão Est (of Estricalla) began playing with the group in 2016, including Canadian and European touring.

Marc Belke reworked two demo tracks from 2000 and released them as SNFU&#x27;s &quot;A Happy Number&quot; single on Rake Records in November 2017. The songs were far more experimental than anything else in the band&#x27;s catalog and featured heavy use of electronic musical elements. Writing for PunkNews.org, reviewer Jefftommy called the &quot;odd duck of a record&quot; a &quot;pretty little song by a hardcore band of yore&quot; and recommended the record for the band&#x27;s fans; Razorcake critic Ty Stranglehold praised the &quot;hauntingly strange little ditties with keyboards and a drum machine&quot; and the band&#x27;s experimentation. The group&#x27;s final live appearances were in early 2018.

===Hiatus, Chinn&#x27;s death, and aftermath===
The band planned further 2018 dates, but canceled these due to illness and announced a hiatus. Steffes and later Bacon joined the Real McKenzies. In June 2019, Artoffact Records released &quot;...And Yet, Another Pair of Lost Suspenders&quot;, a live album recorded during the 1992 reunion tour at Les Foufounes Électriques in Montreal.

In November, Chinn revealed that he had a serious medical condition projected soon to become fatal. While ill, he recorded a solo 7-inch single with orchestral versions of &quot;Hurt&quot; (written by Nine Inch Nails and later covered by Johnny Cash) and SNFU&#x27;s &quot;Painful Reminder.&quot; Chinn died on July 16, 2020, at age 57. SNFU released the acoustic track &quot;Cement Mixer,&quot; Chinn&#x27;s final recording, via YouTube shortly after his death.

Marc Belke and Rake Records released the EP &quot;A Blessing but with It a Curse&quot; in March 2021. The EP included outtakes from the &quot;In The Meantime and In Between Time&quot; sessions and guest appearances from members of Propagandhi. &quot;...And No One Else Wanted to Play&quot; was named the winner of the public vote for the 2022 Polaris Music Prize&#x27;s Slaight Family Heritage Prize.

Original drummer Jones died on April 17, 2021, and Card died on April 8, 2024.

<doc id="539131" wikidata="Q335994" url="?curid=539131" title="Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough">
<text>Field Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough, (3 November 1779 – 2 March 1869) was a senior British Army officer. After serving as a junior officer at the seizure of the Cape of Good Hope during the French Revolutionary Wars, Gough commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot during the Peninsular War. After serving as commander-in-chief of the British forces in China during the First Opium War, he became Commander-in-Chief, India and led the British forces in action against the Marathas defeating them decisively at the conclusion of the Gwalior campaign and then commanded the troops that defeated the Sikhs during both the First Anglo-Sikh War and the Second Anglo-Sikh War.

==Early career==
Born into Anglo-Irish gentry, Gough was the son of Lieutenant Colonel George Gough and Letitia Gough (née Bunbury), of Lisnavagh. One of his ancestors was a Wiltshire born descendant of Ranulf de Briquessart, who settled in Ireland in the 17th century.

Gough was commissioned into the Limerick Militia on 7 August 1793. He transferred to a locally raised regiment on 7 August 1794 and, having been promoted to lieutenant in the 119th Regiment of Foot on 11 October 1794, transferred to the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot on 6 June 1795. He took part in the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in September 1795 during the French Revolutionary Wars and transferred to the 87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot in December 1795, before being deployed with the 1st Battalion of the 87th to the West Indies, taking part in the expedition to Dutch Guiana in 1799. He was promoted to captain on 25 June 1803, and a year later, after his return, promoted to major of the newly raised 2nd Battalion of his Prince of Wales&#x27;s Irish.

==Peninsular War==
Gough joined Sir Arthur Wellesley in Spain in January 1809 and commanded the 2nd Battalion of his regiment at the Battle of Talavera in July 1809, during which he was wounded. He also fought at the Battle of Barrosa, where his regiment captured a French Imperial Eagle in March 1811. Promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 30 March 1811, he also took part in the Siege of Tarifa in January 1812, the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and the Battle of Nivelle, during which he was again badly wounded in November 1813. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 25 May 1815, appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815 and appointed a Knight Bachelor on 16 March 1816.

Promoted to colonel on 12 August 1819, Gough became commanding officer of the 22nd Regiment of Foot in County Tipperary where he also served as a local magistrate. He was promoted to major general on 22 July 1830 and advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 18 September 1831.

==Service in the east==

Gough became General Officer Commanding the Mysore division of the Madras Army in 1837. At the outset of the First Opium War in March 1839 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the British forces in China. He led the assault at the Battle of Canton in May 1841, and having been promoted to the local rank of lieutenant general in India and in China on 18 June 1841, he also led the assault at the Battle of Amoy in August 1841. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 14 October 1841 and promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 23 November 1841, he commanded the British forces at the Battle of Chapu in May 1842 and at the Battle of Chinkiang in July 1842. After the Treaty of Nanking, the British forces were withdrawn and he returned to India. He became a baronet on 1 December 1842 and was promoted to the local rank of full general in India on 3 March 1843.

In August 1843 Gough became Commander-in-Chief, India, and in December 1843 he led the British forces in action against the Mahrattas defeating them decisively at the conclusion of the Gwalior campaign. He also commanded the troops at the Battle of Mudki in December 1845, at the Battle of Ferozeshah also in December 1845 and at the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War. Gough was loyally supported by Lord Hardinge, the governor-general, who served under him during these actions. Gough was elevated to the peerage as Baron Gough of Chinkiang in China and of Maharajpore and the Sutlej in the East Indies on 7 April 1846.

The Second Anglo-Sikh War started in 1848, and again Gough took to the field commanding in person at the Battle of Ramnagar in November 1848 and at the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849. He was criticised for relying on frontal assault by infantry rather than using artillery and was replaced as commander-in-chief by Sir Charles Napier but, before news of his replacement had arrived, Gough achieved a decisive victory over the Sikhs in the Battle of Gujarat in February 1849. He returned to Ireland and was advanced in the peerage as Viscount Gough of Goojerat in the Punjab and of the City of Limerick on 4 June 1849. He retired from active service later that year and was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 20 June 1854.

Gough also served as colonel of the 99th Regiment of Foot, as colonel of the 87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot and later as colonel of the Royal Horse Guards. In Dublin, he was a member of the Kildare Street Club. He was promoted to field marshal on 9 November 1862.

==Death and commemoration==
He died at St. Helen&#x27;s, his home in Booterstown, on 2 March 1869 and was buried in Stillorgan.

Proposals for a statue to Gough began in 1869 but were rejected by Dublin Corporation, including sites in Carlisle Bridge, Foster Place and Westmoreland Street. An equestrian statue of Gough by John Foley was ultimately erected outside the city, in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park in 1878 but, after being repeatedly vandalised in the 1940s and 1950s, it was moved to Chillingham Castle in Northumberland in 1990. The inscription reads:

In honour of Field Marshal Hugh Viscount Gough, K.P., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., an illustrious Irishman, whose achievements in the Peninsular War, in China, and in India, have added lustre to the military glory of his country, which he faithfully served for seventy five years. This statue [cast from cannon taken by troops under his command and granted by Parliament for the purpose] is erected by friends and comrades.

The cannon referred to were captured by Gough in China and India and yielded 15 tons of gun-metal for the statue.

==Family==
In June 1807, Gough married Frances Maria Stephens, daughter of General Edward Stephens. His daughter, the Hon. Frances Maria Gough, was married to Field Marshal Sir Patrick Grant.

As the 1st Viscount Gough, he set down a family seat near Gort at Lough Cutra Castle, County Galway, Ireland, when purchased by him in 1852.

Gough&#x27;s first cousins included Thomas Bunbury of Lisnavagh, County Carlow, MP for Carlow, and Jane McClintock of Drumcar, mother of the 1st Baron Rathdonnell.

<doc id="539132" wikidata="Q1600638" url="?curid=539132" title="Marsanne">
<text>Marsanne () is a white wine grape, most commonly found in the Northern Rhône region. It is often blended with Roussanne. In Savoie the grape is known as &quot;grosse roussette&quot;. Outside France it is also grown in Switzerland (where it is known as &quot;ermitage blanc&quot; or just &quot;ermitage&quot;), Spain (where it is known as &quot;Marsana&quot;), Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.

==Wine regions==

The grape most likely originated in the Northern Rhône region where it is widely planted today, more precisely in the village and abbey of Marsanne (Drôme). It is a principal component of the white wines from the Hermitage, Crozes-Hermitage and Saint-Joseph AOCs. It is the most widely planted white wine grape in the Hermitage AOC, where it is often blended with Roussanne. Along with Roussanne, up to 15% of Marsanne can be added to the red wine of Hermitage under &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) regulations. In the Saint-Péray AOC, it is used for both still and sparkling wine production. In the Southern Rhône, Marsanne is not one of the white grapes permitted in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC, although Roussanne is. (In Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, Clairette blanc adds similar characteristics as Marsanne.) It can be found in some white wines from the Côtes du Rhône AOC. Although Marsanne is mostly made into a dry wine, it is commonly made into a sweet wine in Valais, Switzerland and some producers in the Rhône have also experimented with making a dessert-style straw wine with Marsanne.

Outside the Northern Rhône region, Marsanne is also found in Savoie and in the Languedoc where it is often blended with Viognier. It is a permitted grape in the Provence wine of Cassis though it is not widely used.

===Outside France===

In Australia, the grape was first planted in Victoria in the 1860s. The Victorian vineyard of Tahbilk has Marsanne vines which date back to 1927 and are some of the oldest in the world. In Switzerland, Marsanne is grown in Valais where it is locally known as Ermitage and made into both sweet wines and dry steely white wines with high alcohol levels.

In British Columbia and Washington State, plantings of Marsanne continue to increase as producers blend it with Roussanne and Viognier. Varietal Marsanne from Washington has been shown to have notes of ripe white peach and spiced pear. In California, the Rhone Rangers movement introduced Marsanne to more consumers in wines that are often blended with Roussanne and Viognier. In Spain there are some plantings of Marsanne in the northeast. In New Jersey Unionville Vineyards grows Marsanne, Roussanne, and other Rhone varieties. Sommeliers have found that the vintage in relation to the climate has exaggerated effects on Marsanne blends in the United States. In Michigan Domaine Berrien Cellars is the sole non-California member of the Rhone Rangers and pioneered the planting of Marsanne, Roussanne, Viognier, and Syrah in 1992. Domaine Berrien Cellars credits the success of their award-winning Marsanne and Oak Marsanne varietals to the unique microclimate of the Lake Michigan Shore AVA.

In New Zealand, Marsanne is grown in the East of the North Island. In Gisborne, Doug and Delwyn Bell grow Marsanne which is used to produce the &quot;Allison&quot; Gisborne Marsanne for Coopers Creek. In nearby Hastings Marsanne is blended with Viognier and fermented in aged French oak barrels which give a richness and complexity without introducing intrusive oak notes.

==Viticulture==

While not as temperamental as the Roussanne grape, Marsanne is prone to underperform in less than ideal sites. In climates that are too hot, the grape can overripen and produce wine that is very flabby. In places that are too cool, the grape cannot ripen fully and produces wine with a bland and neutral flavor. In order to maintain a high level of acidity, winemakers try to harvest Marsanne just before it hits full ripeness. Some Australian winemakers prefer to let the grape hang longer on the vine to increase the alcohol level of the wine and its aging potential.

==Wines==
Marsanne produces deeply colored wines that are rich and nutty, with hints of spice and pear. The wines can be high in alcohol and can be oak aged to develop more body. As Marsanne ages, the wine takes on an even darker color and the flavors can become more complex and concentrated with an oily, honeyed texture. Aromas of nuts and quince can also develop.

==Synonyms==
Marsanne is also known under the synonyms Avilleran, Avilleron, Champagne Piacentina, Ermitage, Ermitage Blanc, Ermitazh, Grosse Roussette, Hermitage, Johannisberg, Marsan Belyi, Marsanne Blanche, Marzanne, Metternich, Rousseau, Roussette de Saint Peray, Roussette Grosse, White Hermitage, and Zrmitazh.

<text>The 16 geomantic figures are primary symbols utilized in geomancy, an ancient divinatory practice. Each figure consists of four lines representing the classical elements and can be interpreted through various methods and questions. Originating from Middle Eastern traditions, geomancy was introduced to Europe in the Middle Ages, where it acquired astrological meanings and new interpretive layers. These figures exhibit a superficial resemblance to the &quot;ba gua&quot;, the eight trigrams in the &quot;I Ching&quot;, a Chinese classic text.

Each figure carries distinct attributes and meanings. Figures are classified by qualities like stability or mobility, impartiality or partiality, and entering or exiting. These classifications provide nuances in interpretation. The figures are associated with elements, zodiac signs, planets, and body parts. They can be paired according to their qualities and properties. The figures&#x27; astrological correspondences introduced in the European tradition further enriched their meanings and connections. 

==The sixteen figures==
Each of the figures is composed of four lines, each line containing either one or two points.

===Via===
Latin for &quot;the Way&quot;. The figure resembles a road or path. It is considered bad of most things, but good with concerns of roads, travels, or journeys. Astrologically it is associated with Cancer and the waning Moon and both its inner and outer elements are water. All the elements in Via are active and as such the figure indicates change more than any other figure. Regarding the outcome of the situation being divined, it is neutral, unless change by itself infers a positive or negative result. This figure inverts any figure when added, giving it another meaning of change. Its planetary ruler is Chashmodai, its Intelligence is the Intelligence of Intelligences Malkah beTarshishim ve-ad Ruachoth Shechalim, and its Spirit is the Spirit of Spirits is Shad Barshemoth ha-Shartathan. It is associated with the deities Diana and Mercurius and the angels Gabriel and Muriel. It is associated with the stomach.

===Cauda Draconis===
Latin for &quot;the Tail of the Dragon&quot; and the figure of the south node of the Moon. It is considered very bad in most situations, such that in older traditions if this was the first figure drawn the geomancy reading was stopped. It is only good in circumstances for ending or completing things, such as breaking up a relationship. It brings good with evil, and evil with good. It is associated with the malefic planets Saturn and Mars and the astrological sign Virgo. Its inner and outer element are both fire. Its planetary intelligences are Agiel and Graphiel and its spirits are Zazel and Bartzabel; it is associated with the deities Mavors, Saeturnus, and Athena, and the angels Cassiel, Samael and Malchidael. It is associated with the left arm.

===Puer===
Latin for &quot;the Boy&quot;. The figure is a representation of a sword or erect phallus and refers to male energies, primarily aggression and passion, but also war and male sexuality. It is bad in most cases, but good in situations where boys (in Antiquity and Medieval society) excelled: love and war. Astrologically it is associated with Aries and Mars. All elements are active except Water, the element of emotion; its inner element is air, but due to it being ruled by Mars, its outer element is fire. Its planetary intelligence is Graphiel and its spirit is Bartzabel; it is associated with the deities Mavors and Athena and the angels Samael and Malchidael. It is associated with the head.

===Fortuna Minor===
Latin for &quot;the Lesser Fortune&quot;. The figure is symbolic of success coming down like beams of light from the Sun. Astrologically it is associated with Leo and the Sun in southern declinations; both its inner and outer elemental rulers are fire. It indicates a weakly positive outcome in nearly all questions, representing transient success that is dependent upon outside help. It favors situations that can be resolved quickly and do not need to be sustained. It is a figure of change and instability. Its planetary intelligence is Nakhiel and its spirit is Sorath; it is associated with the deities Apollo and Jupiter and the angels Michael and Verchiel. It is associated with the spine.

===Puella===
Latin for &quot;the Girl&quot;. The figure is to resemble the vulva or a woman with exaggerated breasts. It is good in most situations, especially with women, beauty, or feminine situations. Astrologically it is associated with Libra and Venus; its outer element is air, but its inner element is water. It represents peace and passivity, which can be either positive or negative depending on the question being answered, though generally positive, requiring to be acted upon instead of it acting on a situation. It is the symbol of feminine sexuality, balancing the energy of Puer. Its planetary intelligence is Hagiel and its spirit is Kedemel; it is associated with the deities Venus and Vulcanus and the angels Anael and Zuriel. It is associated with the kidneys, lower back, buttocks, and skin.

===Amissio===
Latin for &quot;Loss&quot;. The figure is of two bowls or cups turned upside-down. Astrologically, it is associated with Taurus and Venus retrograde. Its inner element is fire but ruled outwardly by earth. In general, the figure is bad or negative figure for all charts except those for love (being a figure of Venus) or where loss is desired and denotes loss. Often it represents something outside of one&#x27;s grasp. Its planetary intelligence is Hagiel and its spirit is Kedemel; it is associated with the goddess Venus and the angels Anael and Asmodel. It is associated with the neck and throat.

===Carcer===
Latin for &quot;the Prison&quot;. The figure is the outline of an enclosure, a link in a chain, or prison cell. It is usually bad in situations and denotes delays, setbacks, or bindings. Astrologically it is associated with Capricorn and Saturn retrograde; its inner and outer element is earth. It refers to immobility, and also thereby strength. Depending on the question it could indicate a restriction or a source of willpower. It is generally unfavourable, but can be favourable in questions involving stability or security. Its planetary intelligence is Agiel and its spirit is Zazel; it is associated with the deities Saeturnus and Vesta, and the angels Cassiel and Hanael. It is associated with the knees and skeletal system of the body.

===Laetitia===
Latin for &quot;Joy&quot;. The figure resembles an arch, fountain, or rainbow. It is good in situations that concern potential, joy, or happiness. Astrologically it is associated with Pisces and Jupiter retrograde. It is ruled externally by water, but inwardly by fire. It is a positive figure for nearly all questions, representing fast situations and construction. It indicates upward motion, happiness, or joy. Its planetary intelligence is Iophiel and its spirit is Hismael; it is associated with the deities Jove and Neptunus, and the angels Sachiel and Barchiel. It is associated with the feet.

===Caput Draconis===
Latin for &quot;the Head of the Dragon&quot;. The figure resembles the astrological symbol the north node of the Moon. It is neutral figure (good with good, evil with evil) but fortunate with starting or beginning new things. It is favourable for beginnings and profit, and otherwise favourable with other favourable figures, and unfavourable with unfavourable ones. It is associated with the benefic planets Jupiter and Venus, and assigned to the zodiac sign of Sagittarius; its outer element is fire due to its association with Sagittarius while its inner element is earth. Its planetary intelligences are Iophiel and Hagiel and its spirits are Hismael and Kedemel; it is associated with the deities Venus, Iove, and Vulcanus, and the angels Sachiel, Anael, and Zuriel. It is associated with the right arm.

===Conjunctio===
Latin for &quot;the Conjunction&quot;. The figure resembles a crossroads or joining of two figures. The sign is neutral in meaning (good in good things, evil in evil), but good with joining or recovering things, especially marriage or relationships. Astrologically it is associated with Virgo and Mercury retrograde. It represents a combination of forces, for good or ill. By itself, it is neutral, only becoming favourable or not by other figures around it. Its outer element is earth, while its inner element is air. Its planetary intelligence is Tiriel and its spirit is Taphthartharath; it is associated with the deities Mercurius and Ceres, and the angels Raphael and Hamaliel. It is associated with the intestines and digestive system.

===Acquisitio===
Latin for &quot;Gain&quot;. The figure resembles two bowls or cups turned upright. It is good in almost all situations, especially for getting and obtaining things. Astrologically it is associated with Sagittarius and Jupiter, with its outer element ruled by fire and its inner element ruled by air. For most charts it is a positive figure, except where a loss is desired. It indicates a gain financially, mentally, or in any other form, or something within one&#x27;s grasp. Its planetary intelligence is Iophiel and its spirit is Hismael; it is associated with the deities Jove and Diana, and the angels Sachiel and Adnachiel. It is associated with the hips and thighs.

===Rubeus===
Latin for &quot;Red&quot;. The figure is an overturned glass; an inversion, meaning good in all that is evil, and evil in all that is good. Like the Tail of the Dragon, the figure is considered so unfavourable that if it were the first in a reading, the reading would end. Astrologically it is associated with Scorpio and Mars retrograde; its inner element is ruled by air, and its outer element ruled by water. It represents passion, deception, violence, and vice. Its planetary intelligence is Graphiel and its spirit is Bartzabel; it is associated with the god Mavors, and the angels Samael and Barbiel. It is associated with the reproductive and excretory systems along with the genitals.

===Fortuna Major===
Latin for &quot;the Greater Fortune&quot;. The figure resembles blessings growing from the earth and being fruitful in the air. It is good in all situations in a best case scenario sense and represents great good fortune, especially in beginnings. Astrologically it is associated with Leo, like Fortuna Minor, but by the Sun in northern declinations. Its inner element is earth while its outer element is fire. It denotes power and success, and so is very favourable in conflicts and contests; being a figure of stability and long-term success, it also denotes hardship at the outset of an endeavor. Its planetary intelligence is Nakhiel and its spirit is Sorath; it is associated with the deities Apollo and Jupiter, and the angels Michael and Verchiel. It is associated with the heart and chest.

===Albus===
Latin for &quot;White&quot;. The figure resembles an upright glass or goblet. It is good in most situations, especially with good figures in company, but itself is a weak figure. Astrologically it is associated with Gemini and Mercury; even though its inner element is water, its outer element is air. It represents peace, wisdom and purity. It benefits beginnings and profit, or any situation where careful and deliberate planning is needed. Its planetary intelligence is Tiriel and its spirit is Taphthartharath; it is associated with the deities Mercurius and Apollo, and the angels Raphael and Ambriel. It is associated with the shoulders and lungs.

===Tristitia===
Latin for &quot;Sorrow&quot;. The figure resembles a broken arch or a stake being driven into the ground. It is bad in most cases and connotes sadness or mourning. Astrologically it is associated with Aquarius and Saturn. Tristitia is an unfavorable figure in almost all questions, usually representing pain and suffering. However, it is favorable in questions dealing with stability, building, or the Earth (such as agriculture). Its outer element is air and inner element is earth. Its planetary intelligence is Agiel and its spirit is Zazel; it is associated with the deities Saeturnus and Juno, and the angels Cassiel and Gabriel. It is associated with the ankles and lower legs.

===Populus===
Latin for &quot;the People&quot;. The figure resembles a bird&#x27;s eye view of a group of people. The figure can mean that the outcome is based on the people of the situation, or represents a large number of people or peers. Astrologically it is associated with Cancer and the waxing Moon; both its inner and outer elements are water. It refers to a gathering or assembly of people and is very neutral, for though there may be a great deal of movement within the crowd, there is very little effect on the crowd as a whole. It is favorable with favorable figures, and unfavorable with unfavorable ones. Its planetary ruler is Chashmodai, its Intelligence is the Intelligence of Intelligences Malkah beTarshishim ve-ad Ruachoth Shechalim, and its Spirit is the Spirit of Spirits is Shad Barshemoth ha-Shartathan. It is associated with the deities Diana and Mercurius, and the angels Gabriel and Muriel. It is associated with the breasts and torso.

==Properties==

Each of the figures is composed of four lines, each line containing either one or two points. Each line represents one of the four classical elements: from top to bottom, the lines represent fire, air, water, and earth. When a line has a single point, the element is said to be active; otherwise, with two points, the element is passive. Because there are four lines, and since each line can be either active or passive, there are 24, or 16, different figures. The different combinations of elements yields different representations or manifestations of the figure&#x27;s energy.

Each figure can be said to have a ruling element, whereby that element&#x27;s energy and manifestations correlates most closely to the figure itself. With the exception of Populus, the ruling element for each figure is always represented as active (a single point in the corresponding line). For figures with only one active element, that element by default is its ruling element; other combinations of active and passive elements require more introspection to assign rulerships. Populus, consisting of all passive lines, is ruled by Water by its nature of being entirely passive and taking on the reflective qualities of water whenever an outside force acts upon it.

While the elements just described are from the geomantic tradition, another set of elemental assignments are used based on the figures&#x27; astrological connections. These elements are assigned based on the zodiac sign of a given figure. The geomantic element is said to reflect the nature of a figure when viewed alone; the astrological element reflects its nature when acting with other figures.

Another classification of the geomantic figures involves their quality, which is either &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;mobile&quot;. The quality of a figure represents its duration of effect or motion, such that a figure with a stable quality will represent a long-term situation or that a certain object remains where it was left, while a mobile figure represents a transient effect upon the real world. In simple &quot;yes or no&quot; style divinations, stable figures indicate a positive answer, while mobile figures indicate a negative one.

Originally, the quality was shown in terms of &quot;entering&quot; or &quot;exiting&quot; figures, where, from the viewer&#x27;s point of view, the figure would be pointing towards (downward) or away from (upward) the viewer. Entering figures have the stable quality, while the exiting figures have the mobile quality; when an entering figure is rotated upside-down, it becomes an exiting figure, and vice versa. However, based on this classification, the four figures that point in both directions regardless of rotation have the quality of both entering and exiting and must be evaluated in terms of its neighbors or generating figures.

In the generation of the geomantic charts, the primary answer is given by the figure called the Judge. Based upon the mathematics involved in generating the charts, the Judge figure must always have an even number of points. For this reason, all the figures that can appear as Judges (i.e. have an even number of points) are also termed &quot;impartial&quot; figures; they represent objective states of the world observable equally by any party. The ones with odd numbers of points are termed &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;personal&quot; due to their subjective and emotional nature.

In the Middle Ages, when geomancy was introduced to Europe where astrology was the foremost occult science, the geomantic figures obtained astrological correspondences to the Zodiac and to the planets. Based on their zodiacal correspondences, astrologers assigned new elemental rulerships (henceforth known as outer elemental rulers, whereas the previous elemental assignments will be known as inner elemental rulers) based on the element of their zodiacal ruler. The exceptions to the planetary rulerships were the figures Cauda Draconis and Caput Draconis, which were assigned to the northern and southern lunar nodes instead.

Traditionally, the energies and manifestations of the planets were different based on their declination or motion; for the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the diurnal energy represents the planet in direct motion, while the nocturnal energy refers to the retrograde motion of the planets. For the Moon, this was illustrated by the waxing or waning periods of the Moon, respectively; the Sun&#x27;s figures were based on the Sun during the day (or northern declination) or during the night (southern declination). The zodiacal rulerships followed from the diurnal or nocturnal planetary rulership: nocturnal figures are assigned earth and water signs, while diurnal figures are assigned fire and air signs. The North Node is assigned, by Gerard of Cremona, to Sagittarius and the South Node to Virgo (for the sake of finding the ascendant in astrological traditions of geomancy). Once the zodiacal rulerships were agreed upon, all the following correspondences followed upon the geomantic figures, including what part of the body they each ruled over, different countries, planetary hours, body and character types, and so on.

==Operations==
===Addition===
The structure of the figures themselves can be directly translated into binary numbers, such as those used by modern computers, with passive lines representing the numeral 0 (or logic low) and active lines representing the numeral 1 (or logic high). This structure is exploited in computation of more figures by means of the XOR function used widely in computer science and electrical systems; when two figures are &quot;added&quot; to form a new figure (where points in the lines of the same elements are summed, divided by two, and the remainder taken), the logical operation obtains the new figure by determining which lines are different. The lines that have different numbers of points results in a line with one point (logic high), and lines with the same number of points results in a line with two points (logic low). The result of adding two figures is usually interpreted to mean the interaction between the two parties (the parent figures) or the present situation (when one parent represents the past and the other parent represents the future).

===Inversion===
In the same fashion how Boolean values or binary numbers can be inverted, geomantic figures can likewise be inverted. By inversion, figures whose lines are active become passive and vice versa. In this manner, Puer becomes Albus, Populus becomes Via, and so forth. Inversion represents a polarity of action, e.g. the rashness of Puer balanced by the calmness of Albus.

===Reversion===
Reversion, or rotation, of figures is the process that replaces the fire line of a figure with the earth line, the air line with the water line, and vice versa. By reversion, Puer and Puella are reverted pairs, as are Rubeus and Albus. Not all figures have a unique reversion: the figures that are neither entering nor exiting revert into themselves and the other figures with even points revert into their inverted figure. Reversion often represents an axial polarity, such as the male and female axis between Puer and Puella.

<text>The olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum) is an Old World warbler in the tree warbler genus &quot; Hippolais&quot;. It breeds in southeast Europe and the Near East. It is migratory, wintering in eastern and southern Africa, from Kenya south to South Africa.

This small passerine bird is a species found in open-canopy oakwoods, olive groves, orchards and almond plantations. Three or four eggs are laid in a nest in a low tree or a bush.

This is a medium-sized warbler, similar to in size to the barred warbler, with a slightly longer bill and shorter tail. It is the largest &quot;Hippolais&quot; warbler, with a heavy bill, rather flat crown, long wings, and heavy legs. The adult has a dusty- or brownish-grey back and wings, and dusty-white underparts.

It feeds on invertebrates. Its song is a succession of loud creaks and squawks, lower in pitch than other &quot;Hippolais&quot; warblers, and slower in delivery.
The genus name &quot;Hippolais&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;hupolais&quot;, as misspelt by Linnaeus. It referred to a small bird mentioned by Aristotle and others and may be onomatopoeic or derived from &quot;hupo&quot;,&quot;under&quot;, and &quot;laas&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;. The specific &quot;olivetorum&quot; is Latin for &quot;of the olive groves &quot;.

<doc id="539144" wikidata="Q274081" url="?curid=539144" title="Darla Hood">
<text>Darla Jean Hood (November 8, 1931 – June 13, 1979) was an American child actress, best known as the female lead in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series from 1935 to 1941. As an adult, she performed as a singer in nightclubs and on television. 

==&quot;Our Gang&quot;==
Hood was born in Leedey, Oklahoma, the only child of music teacher Elizabeth Davner, and James Claude Hood, who worked in a bank.
Her mother introduced her to singing and dancing at an early age, taking her to lessons in Oklahoma City. Just after her third birthday she was taken to New York City, where she was seen by Joe Rivkin, a casting director for Hal Roach Studios, who arranged a screen test. She was hired and went to Culver City, California, to appear in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series.

Hood used her real name in the series except for her debut, in which her character&#x27;s name was &quot;Cookie&quot;. She made her debut at age four in the 1935 film &quot;Our Gang Follies of 1936&quot; and was soon given a role in &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; with Laurel and Hardy. From 1935 through 1941, she continued to play in &quot;Our Gang&quot;. She is well remembered for her coquettish character, typically the love interest of Alfalfa, Butch, or (occasionally) Waldo. One of her most memorable moments was singing &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot; in &quot;The Pinch Singer&quot;.

Hood&#x27;s final &quot;Our Gang&quot; appearance was at age 10 in 1941&#x27;s &quot;Wedding Worries&quot;.

== After &quot;Our Gang&quot; ==
When she outgrew her role in &quot;Our Gang,&quot; Hood appeared in several other movies and attended school in Los Angeles. While at Fairfax High School, she organized a vocal group called the Enchanters with four boys. Shortly after graduation, the quintet was booked by producer and vaudeville star Ken Murray for his famous &quot;Blackouts&quot;, a stage variety show. The group remained with Murray&#x27;s Blackouts during its long run in New York City and Hollywood.
Hood went solo with singing engagements in nightclubs and guest appearances on TV. The deep, rich voice she developed as an adult was a striking contrast to the child singing most of the public remembered. She was a regular on &quot;The Ken Murray Show&quot; from 1950 to 1951. In 1955, she was a leading lady in the act of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. In 1957, Hood was a regular performer on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; for the American Broadcasting Network. Other credits that year include a hit record, &quot;I Just Wanna Be Free.&quot; and a duet with Johnny Desmond in the Sam Katzman movie &quot;Calypso Heat Wave&quot;. Between 1959 and 1962 ,she recorded several singles for the small Ray Note and Acama labels.
In January 1959, Hood released a new record, &quot;My Quiet Village&quot; (Ray Note Records). Joe Rivkin, who discovered her as a child, saw the cover and cast her in her final film role —her first adult role in a movie— playing a secretary in the suspense drama &quot;The Bat&quot; with Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead. In 2018, along with Hood&#x27;s recording of &quot;Silent Island,&quot; &quot;My Quiet Village&quot; was re-released by The Numero Group both on the Exotica compilation &quot;Technicolor Paradise: Rhum Rhapsodies &amp; Other Exotic Delights&quot; and on &quot;Silent Island,&quot; a digital-download-only retrospective of Hood&#x27;s vocal music.
Hood was a guest on such TV shows of the early 1960s as &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; and &quot;The Jack Benny Program,&quot; where she appeared on October 30, 1962 as &quot;Darla&quot; in a spoof of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies with Jack Benny (who appeared as Alfalfa), and &quot;The Charlotte Peters Show&quot; in St. Louis. She did singing and voice-over on TV commercials, which included Campbell&#x27;s Soup and Chicken of the Sea tuna. She was also featured in &quot;The Little Rascals Christmas Special&quot; (1979) as the voice of Spanky and Porky&#x27;s mother. She appeared in her own nightclub act at the Coconut Grove in Los Angeles, the Copacabana in New York, and the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Personal life==
Hood was married twice, first to singer and insurance salesman Robert W. Decker (1949–1957), then to record-company executive Jose Granson (1957–1979). She and Granson had three children. Tommy &quot;Butch&quot; Bond mentioned that her marriage to Granson was difficult because he used a wheelchair following a stroke.

==Death==
Hood was busy organizing the 1980 &quot;Little Rascals&quot; reunion for the Los Angeles chapter of The Sons of the Desert when she underwent an appendectomy at Canoga Park Hospital, Canoga Park, California. After the procedure, she died unexpectedly of heart failure on June 13, 1979, at age 47. An autopsy disclosed that Hood had contracted Hepatitis from a contaminated blood transfusion given during the operation which led to her death.

Upon learning of Hood&#x27;s death, fellow &quot;Our Gang&quot; member Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas said &quot;I hate to hear it. It&#x27;s a shock. She was an awfully nice person, a fine woman. We got along real good as kids.&quot; Thomas died a little over a year later. &quot;Our Gang&quot; members Matthew &quot;Stymie&quot; Beard and Mickey Laughlin attended her funeral.

<doc id="539146" wikidata="Q7314457" url="?curid=539146" title="2004 Taiwanese cross-strait relations referendum">
<text>A consultative referendum was held in Taiwan on 20 March 2004 to coincide with the 2004 presidential elections. Voters were asked two questions regarding the cross-strait relations, that is, between Taiwan and China. The initiation of this referendum by President Chen Shui-bian came under intense criticism from China because it was seen as an exercise for an eventual vote on Taiwanese independence. The Pan-Blue Coalition urged a boycott, citing that the referendum was illegal and unnecessary.

Over 90% of voters approved the two questions, but the results were invalid due to insufficient voter turnout, which was below 50%.

==Background==
On 29 November 2003 President Chen Shui-bian announced that given that the PRC had missiles aimed at Taiwan, he had the power under the defensive referendum clause of the Referendum Act to order a referendum on sovereignty, although he did not do so under pressure by the USA. This statement was very strongly criticized both by Beijing and by the Pan-Blue Coalition. But instead, he proposed a referendum to ask the PRC to remove the hundreds of missiles it has aimed at Taiwan.

In a televised address made on 16 January 2004 President Chen reiterated his &quot;Four Noes and One Without&quot; pledge, justified the &quot;peace referendum,&quot; and announced its questions.

The vetting of the referendum bill appeared to alarm Beijing which issued more sharp threats of a strong reaction if a referendum bill passed which would allow a vote on sovereignty issues such as the territory and flag of the ROC. The final bill that was passed by the Legislative Yuan on 27 November 2003 did not contain restrictions on the content of any referendums, but did include very high hurdles for referendums on constitutional issues. These hurdles were largely put in place by the Pan-Blue Coalition majority in the legislature. The bill also contained a provision for a defensive referendum to be called if the sovereignty of the ROC was under threat. In response to the referendum passage, Beijing issued vague statements of unease.

==Questions==
===Proposal 1===
===Proposal 2===
==Campaign==
A series of ten debates were held over five days (Wednesdays and Sundays) on the referendum (first pair on first question; second on second; pro-government listed before con-)
*29 February – Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung v. independent Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei; Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh v. Commentator Li Ao
*3 March – Office of the President&#x27;s Deputy Secretary-General Joseph Wu v. poet Chan Chao-li, Minister without Portfolio Yeh Jiunn-rong v. former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang
*7 March – TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming v. former Control Yuan member Yeh Yao-peng; DPP Legislator Chiu Tai-san v. sociologist Timothy Ting
*10 March – DPP Legislator You Ching v. Green Party Taiwan acting convener Kao Cheng-yan; DPP Legislator Cho Jung-tai v. mainland exile Ruan Ming
*14 March – DPP Legislator Julian Kuo v. anti-March 20 referendum alliance leader Jaw Shaw-kong; Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen v. independent Legislator Sisy Chen

The &quot;no&quot; campaign was not argued by active political figures in the Pan-Blue Coalition, and the CEC at first found it difficult to find people to take the &quot;no&quot; position. The Pan-Blue Coalition made it clear that it was in favour of the proposals, but believed that the referendum process itself was illegal and a prelude to more controversial action. As a consequence, the Pan-Blue Coalition asked its supporters not to vote at all in the referendum, with the intention of having the number of valid votes fall below the 50% voter threshold necessary to have a valid referendum. Because of this strategy, a major controversy was the format of the referendum, specifically as to whether the referendum questions would be on the same ballots as the Presidency. After much debate, the CEC decided that there would be a U-shaped queue in which people would first cast a ballot for president and then cast a separate ballot for each of the two questions. Voters who chose not to cast a referendum ballot could exit the line at the base of the U. Near the end of the campaign, the CEC issued a number of conflicting and constantly changing directives as to what would constitute a valid ballot.

<doc id="539149" wikidata="Q5645949" url="?curid=539149" title="Terry Hall (ventriloquist)">
<text>Terence &quot;Terry&quot; Hall (20 November 1926 – 3 April 2007) was an English ventriloquist. He appeared regularly on television with his puppet, Lenny the Lion, whose catchphrase was &quot;Aw, don&#x27;t embawass me!&quot; Hall is credited with having been one of the first ventriloquists to use a non-human puppet.

==Biography==
Hall was born in Chadderton, Lancashire, where his parents ran a working men&#x27;s club. He was educated at St Patrick&#x27;s School in Oldham and at De La Salle College in Pendleton, Salford. Hall initially worked as a ventriloquist with a boy dummy, named Mickey Finn, and won a talent show aged 15.

Hall created Lenny the Lion in 1954 after he visited the zoo while working at the summer season in Blackpool. Lenny was made from an old fox fur and papier-mâché, with a golf ball for the nose. He originally had a mouthful of fearsome teeth, but they were removed at the suggestion of singer Anne Shelton to avoid scaring children in the audience.

Hall and Lenny first appeared on BBC Television in 1956, in a variety show entitled &quot;Dress Rehearsal&quot; that also signalled Eric Sykes&#x27;s television debut. The &quot;Lenny the Lion Show&quot; ran on from 1957 to 1960, followed by &quot;Lenny&#x27;s Den&quot; in 1959 to 1961, and the pop music show &quot;Pops and Lenny&quot; in 1962 to 1963. In 1958 Bill Mevin created a comic strip based on &quot;Lenny the Lion&quot;. Hall visited the United States in 1958, making his debut on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with Lenny that year. Throughout the 1960s, Hall and Lenny appeared on stage in Blackpool and on television. The Beatles made one of their early TV appearances in a 1963 episode of &quot;Pops and Lenny&quot;, singing &quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;Please, Please Me&quot;. David Bowie&#x27;s father, Hayward Jones, worked on the show, and launched the Lenny the Lion Fan Club. Lenny advertised Trebor mints for three years. Hall released a single, &quot;Lenny&#x27;s Bath Time&quot;, in 1963.

In spite of the fact that Hall was a staunch Oldham Athletic fan, during the 1957–58 English football season, Hall took Lenny to the Den (old) which was then the home of Millwall F.C. and allowed Lenny to pose with his &quot;fellow Lions&quot; for publicity shots, much to the delight of all present in the ground.

Hall and Lenny continued to work in variety through the 1970s, appearing on television in programmes such as &quot;Crackerjack&quot; and &quot;3-2-1&quot;. From 1977 to 1980, Hall regularly appeared in the educational television programme &quot;Reading With Lenny&quot;. He wrote the &quot;Kevin the Kitten&quot; series of children&#x27;s reading books which accompanied the series.

Hall married twice. He had two daughters, Beverley and Melanie from his first marriage to Kathleen Mary Hall,who died. He married a second time in 1980, to dance teacher Denise Francis. He suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in later life, and died in 2007 in Coventry aged 80. Dr Harry Brünjes, a long-standing family friend, gave the eulogy at the service.

<doc id="539155" wikidata="Q334818" url="?curid=539155" title="Kazi Nazrul Islam">
<text>Kazi Nazrul Islam (, ; 24 May 1899 – 29 August 1976) was a Bengali poet, short story writer, journalist, lyricist and musician. He is the national poet of Bangladesh. Nazrul produced a large body of poetry, music, messages, novels, and stories with themes, that included equality, justice, anti-imperialism, humanity, rebellion against oppression and religious devotion. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s activism for political and social justice as well as writing a poem titled as &quot;Bidrohī&quot;, meaning &quot;the rebel&quot; in Bengali, earned him the title of &quot;Bidrohī Kôbi&quot; (&quot;Rebel Poet&quot;). His compositions form the avant-garde music genre of Nazrul Gīti (&quot;Music of Nazrul&quot;).

Born into a Bengali Muslim Kazi family from Churulia in Burdwan district in Bengal Presidency (now in West Bengal, India), Nazrul Islam received religious education and as a young man worked as a muezzin at a local mosque. He learned about poetry, drama, and literature while working with the rural theatrical group &quot;Leṭor Dôl&quot;, &quot;Leṭo&quot; being a folk song genre of West Bengal usually performed by the people from Muslim community of the region. He joined the British Indian Army in 1917 and was posted in Karachi. Nazrul Islam established himself as a journalist in Calcutta after the war ended. He criticised the British Raj and called for revolution through his famous poetic works, such as &quot;Bidrohī&quot; (&#x27;The Rebel&#x27;) and &quot;Bhangar Gan&quot; (&#x27;The Song of Destruction&#x27;), as well as in his publication &quot;Dhūmketu&quot; (&#x27;The Comet&#x27;). His nationalist activism in Indian independence movement led to his frequent imprisonment by the colonial British authorities. While in prison, Nazrul Islam wrote the &quot;Rajbôndīr Jôbanbôndī&quot; (&#x27;Deposition of a Political Prisoner&#x27;). His writings greatly inspired Bengalis of East Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War.

Nazrul Islam&#x27;s writings explored themes such as freedom, humanity, love, and revolution. He opposed all forms of bigotry and fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based. Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best known for his songs and poems. He introduced the ghazal songs in the Bengali language and is also known for his extensive use of Arabic and Persian influenced Bengali words in his works.

Nazrul Islam wrote and composed music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on Gramophone Company India gramophone records), collectively known as &quot;Nazrul Gīti.&quot; In 1942 at the age of 43, he began to be affected by an unknown disease, losing his voice and memory. A medical team in Vienna diagnosed the disease as Pick&#x27;s disease, a rare incurable neurodegenerative disease. It caused Nazrul Islam&#x27;s health to decline steadily and forced him to live in isolation. He was also admitted in Ranchi (Jharkhand) psychiatric hospital for many years. 
The ailing Indian poet was taken to Bangladesh with the consent of the Government of India on 24 May 1972, at the invitation of the Government of Bangladesh. His family accompanied him and relocated to Dhaka. Later, on 18 February 1976, the citizenship of Bangladesh was conferred upon him. He died on 29 August 1976.

== Early life ==
Nazrul Islam was born on Wednesday 24 May 1899 in the village of Churulia, Asansol Sadar, Paschim Bardhaman district of the Bengal Presidency (now in West Bengal, India). He was born into the Bengali Muslim Taluqdar family of Churulia and was the second of three sons and a daughter. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s father Kazi Faqeer Ahmed was the imam and caretaker of the local Pirpukur mosque and mausoleum of Haji Pahlawan. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s mother was Zahida Khatun; he had two brothers, Kazi Saahibjaan and Kazi Ali Hussain, and a sister, Umme Kulsum. He was nicknamed &quot;Dukhu Miañ&quot; (দুখু মিঞা; literally, &#x27;the one with grief&#x27;). Nazrul Islam studied at a maktab and madrasa, run by a mosque and a dargah respectively, where he studied the Quran, Hadith, Islamic philosophy, and theology. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1908, the then 10 year old Nazrul Islam took his father&#x27;s place as a caretaker of the mosque to support his family. He also assisted teachers in the school. He later worked as the muezzin at the mosque.

Attracted to folk theatre, Nazrul Islam joined a &quot;leto&quot; (travelling theatrical group) run by his uncle Fazle Karim. He worked and travelled with them, learning to act, as well as writing songs and poems for the plays and musicals. Through his work and experiences, Nazrul Islam began studying Bengali and Sanskrit literature, as well as Hindu scriptures such as the Puranas. Nazrul Islam composed folk plays for the group, which included &quot;Chāshār Shōng&quot; (&#x27;the drama of a peasant&#x27;), and plays about characters from the Mahabharata including &quot;Shokunībōdh&quot; (&#x27;the Killing of &quot;Shakuni&quot;), Rājā Judhisthirer Shōng (&#x27;the drama of King Yudhishthira), &quot;Dātā Kōrno&quot; (&#x27;the philanthropic &quot;Karna&#x27;), Ākbōr Bādshāh&quot; (&#x27;Akbar the emperor&#x27;), &quot;Kobi Kālidās&quot; (&#x27;poet Kalidas&#x27;), &quot;Bidyan Hutum&quot; (&#x27;the learned owl&#x27;), and &quot;Rājputrer Shōng&quot; (&#x27;the prince&#x27;s sorrow&#x27;).

In 1910, Nazrul Islam left the troupe and enrolled at the Searsole Raj High School in Raniganj. In school, he was influenced by his teacher, a Jugantar activist, Nibaran Chandra Ghatak, and began a lifelong friendship with fellow author Sailajananda Mukhopadhyay, who was his classmate. He later transferred to the Mathrun High English School, studying under the headmaster and poet Kumud Ranjan Mullick. Unable to continue paying his school fees, Nazrul Islam left the school and joined a group of kaviyals. Later he took jobs as a cook at Wahid Confectionery, a well-known bakery of the region, and at a tea stall in the town of Asansol. In 1914, Nazrul Islam studied in the Darirampur School (now Govt. Nazrul Academy) in Trishal, Mymensingh District. Amongst other subjects, Nazrul Islam studied Bengali, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian literature and Hindustani classical music under teachers who were impressed by his dedication and skill.

Nazrul Islam studied up to grade10 but did not appear for the matriculation pre-test examination; instead in 1917, he joined the British Indian Army at the age of eighteen. He had two primary motivations for joining the British Indian Army: first, a youthful desire for adventure and, second, an interest in the politics of the time. Attached to the 49th Bengal Regiment, he was posted to the Karachi Cantonment, where he wrote his first prose and poetry. Although he never saw active fighting, he rose in rank from corporal to havildar (sergeant), and served as quartermaster for his battalion.

During this period, Nazrul Islam read extensively the works of Rabindranath Tagore and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, as well as the Persian poets Hafez, Omar Khayyam, and Rumi. He learned Persian poetry from the regiment&#x27;s Punjabi Moulvi, practiced music, and pursued his literary interests. His first prose work, &quot;Life of a Vagabond&quot; (&quot;″Baunduler Atmakahini&quot;), was published in May 1919. His poem &quot;Mukti&quot; (&quot;মুক্তি&quot;, &#x27;Freedom&#x27;) was published by the &quot;Bengali Muslim Literary Journal&quot; (&quot;Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Samiti&quot;) in July 1919.

== Career ==
Kazi Nazrul Islam joined the army in late 1917. Nazrul Islam left the British Indian army in 1920, when the 49th Bengal Regiment was disbanded, and settled in Calcutta. He joined the staff of the &quot;Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Samiti&quot; (&quot;Bengali Muslim Literary Society&quot;). He published his first novel &quot;Bandhan-hara&quot; (&quot;বাঁধন-হারা&quot;, &#x27;Freedom from Bondage&#x27;) in 1920, on which he continued to work over the next seven years. His first collection of poems, which included &quot;&quot;Bodhan&quot;, &quot;Shat-il-Arab&quot;, &quot;Kheya-parer&quot; &quot;Tarani&quot;, and &quot;Badal Prater Sharab&quot;&quot;, received critical acclaim.

Nazrul Islam grew close to other young Muslim writers, while working at the Bengali Muslim Literary Society, including Mohammad Mozammel Haq, Kazi Abdul Wadud, and Muhammad Shahidullah. Nazrul Islam and Muhammad Shahidullah remained close throughout their lives. He was a regular at the social clubs for Calcutta&#x27;s writers, poets, and intellectuals such as the Gajendar Adda and the Bharatiya Adda. Nazrul did not have the formal education of Rabindranath and as a result his poems did not follow the literary practices established by Rabindranath. Due to this he faced criticism from followers of Rabindranath. Despite their differences, Nazrul looked to Rabindranath Tagore as a mentor. In 1921, Nazrul Islam was engaged to Nargis, the niece of a well-known Muslim publisher, Ali Akbar Khan, in Daulatpur, Comilla. On 18 June 1921, the day of the wedding, upon public insistence by Khan that the term &quot;Nazrul must reside in Daulatpur after marriage&quot; be included in the marriage contract, Nazrul Islam walked away from the wedding ceremony.

Nazrul Islam reached the peak of his fame in 1922 with &quot;Bidrohi&quot; (The Rebel), which remains his most famous work, winning the admiration of India&#x27;s literary society for his description of a rebel. Published in the &quot;Bijli&quot; &quot;(বিজলী&quot;, &quot;Lightning&quot;) magazine, the rebellious language and theme were well received, coinciding with the Non-Cooperation Movementthe first mass nationalist campaign of civil disobedience against British rule. Nazrul Islam explores the different forces at work in a rebel, the destroyer, and the preserver who is able to express rage as well as beauty and sensitivity. He followed up by writing &quot;Pralayollas&quot; (&#x27;Destructive Euphoria&#x27;), and his first anthology of poems, the &quot;Agni-veena&quot; (&quot;অগ্নি-বীণা&quot;, &#x27;Lyre of Fire&#x27;) in 1922, which enjoyed commercial and critical success. He also published a volume of short stories, the &quot;Byathar Dan&quot; &quot;ব্যথার দান&quot; (&#x27;Gift of Sorrow&#x27;), and &quot;Yugbani&quot; (&quot;যুগবাণী&quot;), an anthology of essays.

Nazrul Islam started a bi-weekly magazine, &quot;Dhumketu&quot; (&quot;ধূমকেতু&quot;, &#x27;Comet&#x27;) on 12 August 1922 that was critical of the British Empire. Earning the moniker of the &quot;rebel poet&quot;, Nazrul Islam aroused the suspicion of British Raj authorities. The Police raided the office of &quot;Dhumketu&quot; after it published &quot;Anondomoyeer Agomone&quot; (&quot;আনন্দময়ীর আগমনে&quot;), a political poem, in September 1922. Nazrul Islam was arrested on 23 January 1923 and charged with sedition. He presented a long argument in the court, an excerpt of what he said:

On 14 April 1923, he was moved from Alipore Jail to Hooghly Jail in Hooghly. He began a 40-day fast to protest mistreatment by the British jail superintendent, breaking his fast more than a month later and eventually being released from prison in December 1923. Nazrul Islam composed numerous poems and songs during his period of imprisonment. In the 1920s, the British Indian government banned many of his writings. Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his play &quot;Basanta&quot; to Nazrul Islam in 1923. Nazrul Islam wrote the poem &quot;Aj Srishti Shukher Ullashe&quot; to thank Tagore. His book &quot;Bisher Banshi&quot; (&#x27;The Flute of Poison&#x27;), published in August 1924, was banned by the British Raj. &quot;Bisher Banshi&quot; called for rebellion in India against the British Raj. &quot;Bisher Banshi&quot; was read and distributed in secret following the ban.

Nazrul Islam was a critic of the Khilafat Movement in British India which he condemned as &quot;hollow religious fundamentalism&quot;. His rebellious expression extended to rigid orthodoxy in the name of religion and politics. He also criticised the Indian National Congress for not embracing outright political independence from the British Empire. Nazrul became active in encouraging people to agitate against British rule, and joined the Bengal state unit of the Indian National Congress. Along with Muzaffar Ahmed, Nazrul also helped organise the Sramik Praja Swaraj Dal (Workers and Peasants Party), a socialist political party committed to national independence and the service of the working class. On 16 December 1925, Nazrul began publishing the &quot;Langal&quot; (&#x27;Plough&#x27;), a weekly, and served as its chief editor.

During his visit to Comilla in 1921, Nazrul Islam met a young Bengali Hindu woman, Pramila Devi, with whom he fell in love, and they married on 25 April 1924. Brahmo Samaj criticised Pramila, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, for marrying a Muslim. Muslim religious leaders criticised Nazrul Islam for his marriage to a Hindu woman. He also was criticised for his writings. Despite controversy, Nazrul Islam&#x27;s popularity and reputation as the &quot;rebel poet&quot; increased significantly.

With his wife and young son Bulbul, Nazrul Islam settled at Grace Cottage, Krishnanagar in Krishnanagar in 1926. His work began to transform as he wrote poetry and songs that articulated the aspirations of the working class, a sphere of his work known as &quot;mass music&quot;.

In what his contemporaries regarded as one of his greatest flairs of creativity, Nazrul Islam vastly contributed in profusely enriching ghazals in Bengali, transforming a form of poetry written mainly in Persian and Urdu. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s recording of Islamic songs was a commercial success and created interest in gramophone companies about publishing his works. A significant impact of Nazrul Islam&#x27;s work in Bengal was that it made Bengali Muslims more comfortable with the Bengali arts, which used to be dominated by Bengali Hindus. His Islamic songs are popular during Ramadan in Bangladesh. He also wrote devotional songs on the Hindu Goddess Kali. Nazrul Islam also composed a number of notable &quot;Shyamasangeet&quot;, &quot;Bhajan&quot; and &quot;Kirtan&quot;, combining Hindu devotional music. In 1928, Nazrul Islam began working as a lyricist, composer, and music director for the Gramophone Company of India. The songs written and music composed by him were broadcast on radio stations across India, including on the Indian Broadcasting Company.

Nazrul Islam believed in the equality of women, a view his contemporaries considered revolutionary, as expressed in his poem Naari (women). Nazrul Islam&#x27;s poems strongly emphasised the confluence of the roles of both sexes and their equal importance to life. His poem &quot;Barangana&quot; (Prostitute) stunned society with its depiction of prostitutes who he addresses in the poem as &quot;mother&quot;.
In the poem, Nazrul Islam accepts the prostitute as a human being first, reasoning that this person belonged to the &quot;race of mothers and sisters&quot;; he criticises society&#x27;s negative views on prostitutes.

An advocate of women rights, Nazrul Islam portrayed both traditional and nontraditional women in his work. He talked about the working poor through his works such as the
poem: &#x27;Poverty&#x27; (Daridro).

Nazrul Islam wrote thousands of songs, known collectively as &quot;Nazrul Geeti&quot;. The exact number is uncertain. The complete text of 2,260 is known, and the first lines of 2,872 have been collected, but according to musicologist Karunamaya Goswami, it is popularly believed that the total is much higher. Goswami has written that some contemporaries put the number near 4,000.

== Religious beliefs ==
Nazrul Islam was born a Muslim, but engaged in religious syncretism so often such that he was seen by laymen as only a proud pluralist. Nazrul Islam wrote an editorial in &quot;Joog Bani&quot; in 1920 about religious pluralism,
In another article entitled &quot;Hindu Mussalman&quot;, published in &quot;Ganabani&quot; on 2 September 1922, he wrote that the religious quarrels were between priests and Imams and not between laymen Muslims and Hindus. He wrote that the Prophets had become property like cattle but they should instead be treated like a light that is for all men.

Nazrul Islam criticised religious fanaticism, denouncing it as evil and inherently irreligious. He wrote about human equality in his writings. He also explored the philosophy of the Qur&#x27;an and Muhammad by writing about them. Nazrul Islam has been compared to William Butler Yeats by Serajul Islam Choudhury, Bengali literary critic and professor emeritus at the University of Dhaka, for being the first Muslim poet to create imagery and symbolism of Muslim historical figures such as Qasim ibn Hasan, Ali, Umar, Kamal Pasha, and Muhammad. His condemnation of extremism and mistreatment of women provoked condemnation from Muslim and Hindu fundamentalists who opposed his liberal views on religion.

Nazrul Islam&#x27;s mother died in 1928, and his second son, Bulbul, died of smallpox the following year. His first son, Krishna Mohammad, had died prematurely. Pramila gave birth to two more sonsSabyasachi in 1928 and Aniruddha in 1931but Nazrul Islam remained grief-stricken and grieved for a long time. His works changed significantly from the rebellious exploration of society to a deeper examination of religious themes. His works in these years led Islamic devotional songs into the mainstream of Bengali folk music, exploring the Islamic practices of &quot;namaz&quot; (prayer), &quot;roza&quot; (fasting), &quot;hajj&quot; (pilgrimage), and &quot;zakat&quot; (charity). He wrote the song &quot;O Mon Romzaner Oi Rozar Sheshe&quot; on fasting during Ramadan. This was regarded by his contemporaries as a significant achievement, as Bengali Muslims had been strongly averse to devotional music.

Nazrul Islam was not limited to Islamic devotional music but also wrote Hindu devotional music. He composed Agamanis, Bhajans, Shyama Sangeet, and kirtan. Nazrul Islam wrote over 500 Hindu devotional songs. However, a section of Muslims criticised for writing Shyama Sangeet and declared him Kafir (infidel). On the other hand, he became displeased with some Hindus for writing devotional songs about Hindu goddesses because he was a Muslim. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s poetry and songs explored the philosophy of Islam and Hinduism. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s poetry imbibed the passion and creativity of Shakti, which is identified as the Brahman, the personification of primordial energy. He also composed many songs of invocation to Lord Shiva and the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati and on the love of Radha and Krishna. Nazrul Islam was an exponent of humanism. Although a Muslim, he named his sons with both Hindu and Muslim names: Krishna Mohammad, Arindam Khaled (Bulbul), Kazi Sabyasachi and Kazi Aniruddha.

== Later life ==
In 1930, his book &quot;Pralayshikha&quot; was banned and he faced charges of sedition by the British Indian colonial government. He was sent to jail and released in 1931, after the Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed. In 1933, Nazrul Islam published a collection of essays titled &quot;Modern World Literature&quot;, in which he analyses different styles and themes of literature. Between 1928 and 1935, he published 10 volumes containing 800 songs, of which more than 600 were based on classical &quot;ragas&quot;. Almost 100 were folk tunes after &quot;kirtans&quot;, and some 30 were patriotic songs. From the time of his return to Kolkata until he fell ill in 1941, Nazrul Islam composed more than 2,600 songs, many of which have been lost. His songs based on Baul, &quot;jhumur&quot;, Santhali folksongs, jhanpan, or the folk songs of snake charmers, &quot;bhatiali&quot;, and &quot;bhaoaia&quot; consist of tunes of folk-songs on the one hand and a refined lyric with poetic beauty on the other. Nazrul Islam also wrote and published poems for children.

Nazrul Islam&#x27;s success soon brought him into Indian theatre and the then-nascent film industry. His first film as a director was &quot;Dhruba&quot;, which made him the first Muslim director of a Bengali film&quot;.&quot; The film &quot;Vidyapati&quot; (Master of Knowledge) was produced based on his recorded play in 1936, and Nazrul Islam served as the music director for the film &quot;Patalpuri&quot; and &quot;Gora&quot;, (adaptation of Tagore&#x27;s novel). Nazrul Islam wrote songs and directed music for Sachin Sengupta&#x27;s biographical epic play based on the life of Siraj-ud-Daula. He worked on the plays &quot;Jahangir&quot; and &quot;Annyapurna&quot; by Monilal Gangopadhyay. In 1939 Nazrul began working for Calcutta Radio, supervising the production and broadcasting of the station&#x27;s musical programs. He produced critical and analytic documentaries on music, such as &quot;Haramoni&quot; and &quot;Navaraga-malika&quot;. Nazrul Islam also wrote a large variety of songs inspired by the raga &quot;Bhairav&quot;.

== Illness and death ==

Nazrul Islam&#x27;s wife Pramila Devi fell seriously ill in 1939 and was paralysed from the waist down. To provide for his wife&#x27;s medical treatment, he mortgaged the royalties of his gramophone records and literary works for 400 rupees. He returned to journalism in 1940 by working as chief editor for the daily newspaper &quot;Nabajug&quot; (&#x27;New Age&#x27;), founded by the Bengali politician A. K. Fazlul Huq.

On hearing about the death of Rabindranath Tagore on 8 August 1941, a shocked Nazrul Islam composed two poems in Tagore&#x27;s memory. One of the two poems, &quot;Rabihara&quot; (loss of Rabi, or without Rabi), was broadcast on the All India Radio. Within months, Nazrul Islam himself fell ill and gradually began losing his power of speech. His behaviour became erratic, he started spending recklessly and fell into financial difficulties. In spite of her own illness, his wife constantly cared for her husband. However, Nazrul Islam&#x27;s health had seriously deteriorated and he grew increasingly depressed. He received treatment under homeopathy as well as Ayurveda, but little progress was achieved before mental dysfunction intensified and he was admitted to a mental asylum in 1942. Spending four months there without making progress, Nazrul Islam and his family began living a quiet life in India. In 1952, he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in Ranchi. Through the efforts of a large group of admirers who called themselves the &quot;Nazrul Treatment Society&quot;, Nazrul Islam and Pramila were sent to London, then to Vienna for treatment. The examining doctors said he had received poor care, and Dr. Hans Hoff, a leading neurosurgeon in Vienna, diagnosed that Nazrul Islam had Pick&#x27;s disease. His condition was judged to be incurable, Nazrul Islam returned to Calcutta on 15 December 1953. On 30 June 1962 Pramila died, and Nazrul Islam remained in intensive medical care. He stopped working due to his deteriorating health.

Despite receiving treatment and attention, Nazrul Islam&#x27;s physical and mental health did not improve; and Nazrul Islam soon died from his long-standing ailments on 29 August 1976. In accordance with a wish he had expressed in one of his poems, he was buried beside a mosque on the campus of the University of Dhaka.

Controversy has been reported around the funeral of Nazrul Islam. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s sons requested the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi to arrange for the return of their father&#x27;s body to India by an aircraft so that he be buried beside their mother&#x27;s grave as per her last wishes. A space had been reserved for his burial next to her grave in the poets native village, Churulia. When the sons arrived in Dhaka for the last rites, they found that they were completed without their attendance and that the poet had been buried in Dhaka University. Popular demand continues in West Bengal for the poet to be buried back in India.

Bangladesh observed two days of national mourning, and the Parliament of India observed a minute of silence in his honour.

== Criticism ==
According to literary critic Serajul Islam Choudhury, Nazrul Islam&#x27;s poetry is characterised by abundant use of rhetorical devices, which he employed to convey conviction and sensuousness. He often wrote without care for organisation or polish. His works have often been criticised for egotism, but his admirers counter that they carry more a sense of self-confidence than of ego. They cite his ability to defy God, or rather orthodox conceptions of God, yet maintain an inner, humble devotion to Him. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s poetry is regarded as rugged but unique in comparison to Tagore&#x27;s sophisticated style. Nazrul Islam&#x27;s use of Persian vocabulary was controversial, but it increased the range of his work.

== Legacy ==
On 24 May 1972, the newly independent nation of Bangladesh brought Nazrul Islam to live in Dhaka with the consent of the Government of India. The government of Bangladesh conferred upon him the status of national poet in 1972. However it was officially gazetted in 2024. In February 1976, during his stay in Bangladesh, he was awarded Bangladeshi citizenship.

He was awarded an Honorary D.Litt. by the University of Dhaka in 1974 and in 1976. He was awarded the Ekushey Padak by the President of Bangladesh Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem. Many centres of learning and culture in Bangladesh and India had been founded and dedicated to his memory. The Bangladesh Nazrul Sena is a large public organization working for the education of children throughout the country. The Nazrul Endowment provides funding for research into the life and work of Kazi Nazrul Islam in U.S. Universities like California State University, Northridge and Connecticut State University. Nazrul was awarded the Jagattarini Gold Medal, the highest honour for work in Bengali literature by the University of Calcutta, in 1945 and was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award of India, in 1960.

Nazrul Islam&#x27;s works for children have won acclaim for his use of rich language, imagination, enthusiasm, and an ability to fascinate young readers. Nazrul is regarded for his secularism. His poetry has been translated to several languages including English, Spanish, and Portuguese. The Uzbek poet Erkin Vohidov wrote an epic poem about Nazrul Islam entitled &quot;Ruhlar isyoni&quot; (&quot;The Rise of the Spirits&quot;). A major avenue is named after him in Dhaka, Bangladesh. There is a cultural institution called Nazrul Academy, which is spread throughout Bangladesh. A chair has been named after him in University of Calcutta and the Government of West Bengal has opened a Nazrul Tirtha in Rajarhat, a cultural centre with library, auditorium and movie theatre dedicated to his memory. On 25 May 2020, Google celebrated his 121st birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Upcher&#x27;s warbler (Hippolais languida) is an Old World warbler in the tree warbler genus &quot;Hippolais&quot;. It breeds in an area from Turkey south and east to Pakistan. It is migratory, wintering in eastern Africa, from Eritrea and Somalia south to Tanzania.

This small passerine bird is a species found in semi-desert habitats, frequenting bushy scrub and thickets of tamarisk. Four or five eggs are laid in a nest in bushes and low trees.

This is a medium-sized warbler, similar in size to the icterine warbler, with a slightly longer bill and shorter wings and a longer tail. Its frequent tail movement is reminiscent of a &quot;Sylvia&quot; warbler or a chat. Its rather grey plumage is similar to the olivaceous warbler, but tail movements are diagnostic.

It feeds on invertebrates. Its song is similar to that of other &quot;Hippolais&quot; warblers, but distinctive and unmistakable, and entirely different from that of the olivaceous warbler.
Ehrenberg&#x27;s original description of this bird was &#x27;rather vague&#x27; and it was redescribed by Henry Baker Tristram in 1864, naming it &quot;Hippolais upcheri&quot; after his friend Henry Morris Upcher. This is the origin of the bird&#x27;s common name.

<text>The Finnish Border Guard (FBG, ; ) is the agency responsible for enforcing the security of Finland&#x27;s borders. It is a military organisation, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior in administrative issues and to the president of Finland in issues pertaining to his authority as Commander-in-Chief (e.g. officer promotions). The agency has police and investigative powers in immigration matters and can independently investigate immigration violations. The Finnish Coast Guard has search and rescue (SAR) duties, both maritime and inland. Missions inland are often carried out in co-operation with local fire and rescue departments or other authorities.

The Finnish Border Guard consists of 3,800 active duty personnel. Upon mobilization, it would be wholly or partly incorporated into the Finnish Defence Forces and its strength increased with reservists who have served their conscription in the branch. The mobilized strength of the Finnish Border Guard is 12,600 servicemen. The Finland–Russia border is actively monitored. The western sea borders and the western and northern land borders to Sweden and Norway are free to cross under the Nordic passport union, the Border Guard does however maintain personnel in these regions owing to its SAR duties.

There is a separate Finnish Customs agency, and immigration is also handled by the Finnish National Police and the Finnish Directorate of Immigration. PTR (police, customs and border guard) co-operation is well-developed and allows the authorities to conduct each other&#x27;s duties if necessary.

==Duties and jurisdiction==

Main duties of the Finnish Border Guard:
* Protecting the land borders and territorial waters of Finland from unauthorised encroachment.
* Passport control at border crossing points, airports and ports.
* First line of defence against territorial invasions.
* Rescue operations (mainly at sea and in the remote areas of Lapland).
* Provide aid to other authorities such as the fire department in case of unusual events like wild fires.
* Investigation of crimes pertaining to border security.
* Aiding police forces in civil duties such as crowd control and riot control.
* Military operations pertaining to internal security.
* Customs control in the minor border crossing points without customs authorities.
* Training of conscripts for wartime duty. These include (border jaegers) and (special border jaegers).
* (During wartime) Long range patrols and guerrilla tactics behind enemy lines.

For the discharge of its duties, the Border Guard has limited police powers in the areas where it operates. It can, for example, seize and arrest persons and conduct searches in apartments and cars pursuant to same legislation as the police, when investigating a crime. However, the power to arrest a person has been delegated only to the commanding officers of border control detachments and commanders and vice-commanders of larger units.

The Border Guard is not supposed to be used for the keeping of public order under normal circumstances, but it has two readiness platoons that can be used to support the Police in exceptional situations in matters of crowd control and internal security (including incidents involving dangerous armed criminals).
The readiness platoons have been used to supplement riot police during high-profile international events where there is a perceived danger of violent demonstrations, e.g. during the &quot;Smash ASEM&quot; demonstration in 2006. However, the main duty of the readiness platoons is to handle the most demanding border security incidents. Border Guard helicopters have also been used to assist police and rescue authorities in various missions.

The Border Guard also has the power to keep public order in its own facilities and in their immediate vicinity. For the execution of its military exercises, any officer with the minimum rank of Captain can close an area temporarily.

The Border Guard is responsible for enforcing the border zone towards Russia and issues the permits to visit the zone.

==Organisation==

Administrative units are responsible for the functions of the Border Guard. These administrative units are the Border Guard Headquarters, Southeast Finland, North Karelia, Kainuu and Lapland border guard districts, the Gulf of Finland and West Finland coast guard districts, Air Patrol Squadron and Border and Coast Guard Academy.

The Border Guards have two readiness units; the 1st Special Intervention Unit, which operates in South-Eastern Finland, and the 5th Special Intervention Unit, who operates in the Gulf of Finland area.

== History ==

After the Finnish Civil War in 1919, the control of the Finnish borders was given to the former Finnish Russian frontier troops under the command of the Ministry of Interior. Until 1945, only the Russian border was supervised by the Frontier Guard, the Swedish and Norwegian borders having only customs control. In 1929, a separate Sea Guard was founded to prevent the rampant alcohol smuggling caused by the Finnish prohibition of alcohol (1919–1932).

At the start of the Winter War there were nine Border Companies () on the Karelian Isthmus. North of Lake Ladoga the Frontier Guards were combined into six Detached Battalions (). Further north in Petsamo the defence was left to the 10th Detached Company (). After the war marshal Mannerheim awarded all frontier guards the title &quot;Border jäger&quot; (). During the Continuation War, the Frontier Guard companies were combined into 12 Border Jäger battalions () and later during the Lapland War into a Border Jäger Brigade ().

After the Second World War, the Border Guards were placed on all Finnish borders. In the 1950s, the Sea Guard was attached to the Border Guard. Since then, the Border Guard has received a fine public image. It is famed for the wilderness skills of its guards foot-patrolling the forest-covered Russian border, its good efficiency in catching the few illegal border crossers and for the fact that it is the only state authority in large parts of Lapland. In these matters it resembles the popular image of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Border Guard of Finland is one of the links of the chain of protectors of the external borders of the European Union and Schengen agreement.

Nearly every Border Guard District trains small number of conscripts for long range reconnaissance (). Conscripts in Border Guard companies are mostly volunteers and preferably selected from the occupants of border areas, and while trained by Border Guard, they do not perform regular border control duties. Rivalry between from Border Guards and Defence Forces is traditionally high.

Employment in Border Guard is much sought for, especially in North and Eastern Finland, which suffer from chronic unemployment problems. Typically a vacancy in the Border Guard receives at least 50 applications.

<text>Mailsort was a five-digit address-coding scheme used by the Royal Mail (the UK&#x27;s postal service) and its business customers for the automatic direction of mail until 2012. Mail users who could present mail sorted by Mailsort code and in quantities of 4,000 upwards (1,000 upwards for large letters and packets) received a discounted postal rate.

==Use==

Mailsort was not widely known to the British public and the code was not written as part of the address; rather it appears elsewhere on the envelope or label. Although the majority of people in the UK use the postcode, the mailsort code was used for automated sorting.

As the system was only used by a closed group of Royal Mail customers the scheme could be entirely re-coded from time to time (every 18–24 months). The last such update occurred in September 2010.

Unlike posting by ordinary mail it was possible to specify service levels other than 1st or 2nd class with longer delivery times offered. Four Mailsort products were available – known as 70, 120, 700 and 1400 – each based on the customer&#x27;s ability to sort into increasingly smaller geographical areas. A further Walksort product was available to those who wished to post to many of the addresses in an area and who could present mail sorted first by mailsort code and then by walk number (the second half of the postcode).

===Service levels===

Two further services — Presstream 1 and Presstream 2 — were available to publishers of magazines and other periodicals. These services were similar to Mailsort 1400 but offered a greater discount for publications that met certain criteria and had been successfully registered with Royal Mail.

==Structure==

The first three digits, the &quot;Residue Selection Code&quot;, corresponded to an area which can vary in size from one postal district to several postcode areas, although most codes correspond exactly to one postcode area. For example:

*406 corresponds to the KA and ML postcode areas; 
*451 and 452 correspond to the LS postcode area;
*491 corresponds to the London SW postal area; and 
*502 corresponds to the BN postcode area

The last two digits, called the &quot;Direct Selection&quot; code correspond to one or more postal districts.

Mailsort codes were sometimes prefixed by a letter (A-P) which corresponded to sixteen regional divisions of the country, although the letter did not form part of the mailsort code. The letter prefix was used by the sender to ensure that when mail was presented to Royal Mail those items with the furthest to travel were given and processed first while those in the same region as the sender were dealt with last. When mail was presented to Royal Mail it was therefore not given in strict mailsort sequence and furthermore the sequence used would differ from one location in the country to another.
