<text>John Sherman Cooper (August 23, 1901 – February 21, 1991) was an American politician, jurist, and diplomat from the United States. He served three non-consecutive, partial terms in the United States Senate before being elected to two full terms in 1960 and 1966, representing Kentucky. He also served as U.S. Ambassador to India from 1955 to 1956 and U.S. Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976. He was the first Republican to be popularly elected to more than one term as a senator from Kentucky and, in both 1960 and 1966, he set records for the largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate from either party.

Cooper&#x27;s first political service was as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1928 to 1930. In 1929, he was elected county judge of Pulaski County. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1939, he joined the U.S. Army in 1942. During World War II, he earned the Bronze Star Medal for reorganizing the Bavarian judicial system after the allied victory in Europe. While still in Germany, he was elected circuit judge for Kentucky&#x27;s 28th circuit. He returned home to accept the judgeship, which he held for less than a year before resigning to seek election to A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler&#x27;s vacated seat in the U.S. Senate. He won the seat by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time.

During his first term in the Senate, Cooper voted with the majority of his party just 51% of the time. He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1948, after which he accepted an appointment by President Harry S. Truman as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and served as a special assistant to Secretary of State Dean Acheson during the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Cooper was again elected to a partial term in the Senate in 1952. The popular Cooper appeared likely to be re-elected in 1954 until the Democrats nominated former Vice President Alben W. Barkley. Cooper lost the general election and was appointed Ambassador to India by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. Cooper gained the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and dramatically improved relations between the U.S. and the recently independent state of India, helping rebuff Soviet hopes of expanding communism in Asia. Barkley died in 1956, and Eisenhower requested that Cooper seek Barkley&#x27;s open seat. Cooper reluctantly acquiesced and was elected to serve the rest of Barkley&#x27;s term.

In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, securing his first full, six-year term in the Senate. Newly elected President John F. Kennedy – Cooper&#x27;s former Senate colleague – chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson&#x27;s decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper&#x27;s re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church on a series of amendments designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life==
John Sherman Cooper was born August 23, 1901, in Somerset, Kentucky. He was the second child and first son of seven children born to John Sherman and Helen Gertrude (Tartar) Cooper. The Cooper family had been prominent in the Somerset area since brothers Malachi and Edward Cooper migrated from South Carolina along the Wilderness Trail and through the Cumberland Gap around 1790, shortly after Daniel Boone. His father&#x27;s parents – staunch Baptists – were active in the anti-slavery movement in the nineteenth century, and the elder John Sherman Cooper (called &quot;Sherman&quot;) was named after the Apostle John and William Tecumseh Sherman, a hero of the Union in the Civil War. The family was very active in local politics; six of Cooper&#x27;s ancestors, including his father, were elected county judges in Pulaski County, and two had been circuit judges. Sherman Cooper engaged in numerous successful business ventures and was known as the wealthiest man in Somerset. At the time of John Sherman Cooper&#x27;s birth, his father was serving as collector of internal revenue in Kentucky&#x27;s 8th congressional district, a position to which he had been appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt.

During his youth, Cooper worked delivering newspapers, in railroad yards, and in his father&#x27;s coal mines in Harlan County. Despite having formerly served as county school superintendent, Cooper&#x27;s father had a low opinion of the public schools, and until he was in the fifth grade, Cooper was privately tutored by a neighbor. While his father was away on business in Texas, his mother sent him to sixth grade at the public school, which he attended thereafter. At Somerset High School, he played both basketball and football. After the outbreak of World War I, Cooper joined an informal military training unit at the high school. Two of the school&#x27;s instructors organized the boys into two companies, but Cooper, who was given the rank of captain, later recalled that &quot;they taught us how to march and that&#x27;s about all.&quot; During his senior year, Cooper served as class president and class poet. In 1918, he graduated second in his high school class and was chosen to give the commencement speech.

After graduation, Cooper matriculated at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. While at Centre, Cooper was accepted into the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He also played defensive end on the Praying Colonels&#x27; football team. Cooper was a letterman on the team, playing alongside football notables Bo McMillin, Red Roberts, Matty Bell, and Red Weaver. Another member of the team, John Y. Brown Sr., would later become one of Cooper&#x27;s political rivals. Coached by Charley Moran, the team was undefeated in four games in the 1918 season, which was shortened by an outbreak of the Spanish flu.

Although Centre was known as one of Kentucky&#x27;s foremost colleges, Cooper&#x27;s father wanted him to broaden his education and, after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred to Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, Stuart Symington. Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior Promenade Committee, the Student Council, the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi. A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named captain of the basketball team in his junior and senior years. In his senior year, he was accepted into the elite Skull and Bones society but regretted not being accepted into Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduation, he was voted most popular and most likely to succeed in his class.

Cooper earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1923 and enrolled at Harvard Law School later that year. During the summer break of 1924, he returned to Kentucky, where his father, dying of Bright&#x27;s disease, told him that he would soon become the head of the family, and that most of the family&#x27;s resources had been lost in the economic recession of the early 1920s. Cooper returned to Harvard after his father&#x27;s death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family&#x27;s affairs. He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset. Over the next 20 years, he sold his father&#x27;s remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.

==Early political career==
After being urged into politics by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor&#x27;s plan to provide free textbooks for the state&#x27;s school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.

In 1929, Cooper declared his candidacy for county judge of Pulaski County. His opponent, the incumbent, was the president of Somerset Bank and the former law partner of Cooper&#x27;s father. Cooper won the election, however, beginning the first of his eight years as county judge. During his service, he was required by law to enforce eviction notices, but often helped those he evicted find other housing or gave them money himself, earning him the nickname &quot;the poor man&#x27;s judge&quot;. He reportedly became so depressed by the poverty and suffering of his constituents during the Great Depression that he had a nervous breakdown and took a leave of absence to seek psychiatric treatment.

Cooper served on the board of trustees for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946. In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As a result of a mandatory primary election law passed in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a nominating convention, as was typical for the party. Cooper lost the nomination to King Swope, a Lexington circuit court judge and former congressman. by a vote of 121,297 (59%) to 73,305 (36%)

==Service in World War II==
Although well above the draft age at 41 years old, Cooper enlisted for service in the United States Army in World War II in 1942. Immediately offered an officer&#x27;s commission, he chose instead to enlist as a private. After basic training, he enrolled in Officer Candidate School at the Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan. He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students. In 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the XV Corps of General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army as a courier in the military police. Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany. After liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp, Patton ordered the entire population of the nearby city of Weimar to go through it and observe the conditions; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time.

Following the cessation of hostilities, Cooper served as a legal advisor for the 300,000 displaced persons in his unit&#x27;s occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis. Under the terms of the agreement reached at the Yalta Conference, all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the Soviet Union, but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non-Russian spouses and children of the nationals. Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton, who rescinded the repatriation order in the Third Army&#x27;s occupation zone. Cooper received a citation from the Third Army&#x27;s military government section for his action. Cooper also oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of Bavaria in an attempt to replace all the Nazi officials, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Among the judges installed by Cooper were Wilhelm Hoegner, future Minister-President of Bavaria, and Ludwig Erhard, the future Chancellor of Germany.

In 1943 or 1944, while he was still in the Army, Cooper married a nurse named Evelyn Pfaff. Cooper was elected without opposition as circuit judge of Kentucky&#x27;s twenty-eighth judicial district in 1945, despite still being in Germany and not campaigning for the office. He was discharged from the Army with the rank of captain in February 1946 and returned to Kentucky to assume the judgeship.

==First term in the Senate and early diplomatic career==
Cooper&#x27;s judicial district included his native Pulaski County, as well as Rockcastle, Wayne and Clinton counties. During his tenure, blacks were allowed to serve on trial juries in the district for the first time. Of the first 16 opinions he issued during his time on the bench, 15 were upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Kentucky&#x27;s court of last resort at the time.
Cooper resigned his judgeship in November 1946 to seek the U.S. Senate seat vacated when A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler resigned to accept the position of Commissioner of Baseball. Cooper&#x27;s opponent, former Congressman and Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives John Y. Brown Sr., was better known and widely believed to be the favorite in the race. However, Brown had alienated Chandler&#x27;s supporters in the Democratic Party during a hotly contested senatorial primary between Brown and Chandler in 1942, and this group worked against his election in 1946. Further, the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; opposed Brown because of his attacks on former Senator J. C. W. Beckham and Judge Robert Worth Bingham, who were heads of a powerful political machine in Louisville. With these two factors working against Brown, Cooper won the election to fill Chandler&#x27;s unexpired term by a vote of 327,652 (53%) to 285,829 (46%), the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time. His victory marked only the third time in Kentucky&#x27;s history that a Republican had been popularly elected to the Senate. The move to Washington, D.C. proved to be too much for Cooper&#x27;s already strained marriage. In 1947, he filed for divorce, charging abandonment.

Cooper described himself as &quot;a truly terrible public speaker&quot; and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during his career in the Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster&#x27;s special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him &quot;Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?&quot; Cooper responded, &quot;If you&#x27;ll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best.&quot;

A few days after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill passed the Senate, but not the House. Cooper was made chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900 million in federal funds to states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on an amendment to the War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops. He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.

Cooper continued his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican plans to cut taxes despite record national budget deficits and resisting the party&#x27;s efforts to reduce funding for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe in the aftermath of the war. He worked with fellow Kentuckian Alben Barkley and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse to undermine Jim Crow laws enacted by the states and remove obstacles to suffrage for minorities. He also co-sponsored a bill to create the Medicare system, although it was defeated at the time. Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time during his partial term – the lowest average of any member of the party – Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the 1948 Republican National Convention. He supported Arthur Vandenberg for president, but Thomas E. Dewey ultimately received the party&#x27;s nomination. Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead. Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

Cooper was opposed in his re-election bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, an ally of Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As one of only a few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning &quot;Louisville Times&quot; endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky&#x27;s favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman&#x27;s running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by vote of 408,256 (51%) to 383,776 (48%) .

Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley&#x27;s elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley&#x27;s old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.

==Second term in Senate==
Cooper&#x27;s supporters believed he would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman was killed in an automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby&#x27;s appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the &quot;Louisville Times&quot; and the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by a vote of 494,576 (52%) to 465,652 (48%) in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman&#x27;s term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky&#x27;s history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.

Cooper was named to the Senate Committee on Labor, Education and Public Welfare and chaired its education and labor subcommittees. He sponsored a bill authorizing public works projects along the Big Sandy River, including the Tug and Levisa forks. He also supported the reconstruction of the locks and dams along the Ohio River and the construction of locks, dams, and reservoirs in the Green River Valley. He opposed the Dixon-Yates contract, which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of Memphis, Tennessee, calling instead for authorization for the Tennessee Valley Authority to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations. He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and cosponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas.

Cooper continued to be an independent voice in the Senate. During the Red Scare, he was critical of attempts to permit illegal wiretap evidence in federal courts and attempts to reduce the protections against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment. Nevertheless, he refused to strip Joseph McCarthy, the leading figure in the Red Scare, of his major Senate committee chairmanships, cautioning that &quot;many of those who bitterly oppose Senator McCarthy call for the same tactics that they charge him with.&quot; He was the only Republican to oppose the Bricker Amendment, which would have limited the president&#x27;s treaty-making power. He concluded that the issues addressed by the amendment were not sufficient to warrant a change to the Constitution. He also opposed the Submerged Lands Act and the Mexican Farm Labor bill, both of which were supported by the Eisenhower administration. He denounced Eisenhower&#x27;s appointment of Albert M. Cole, an open opponent of public housing, as Federal Housing Administrator and opposed many of the agricultural reforms proposed by Eisenhower&#x27;s Agriculture Secretary, Ezra Taft Benson. Again, his independence did little to diminish his stature in the party. In 1954, he was named to the Senate Republican Policy Committee.

Cooper again sought re-election in 1954. Democrats first considered Governor Wetherby as his opponent, but Wetherby&#x27;s candidacy would have drawn a primary challenger from the Happy Chandler faction of the Democratic Party, possibly leading to a party split and Cooper&#x27;s re-election. Instead, party leaders convinced former Vice President Barkley, now 77 years old, to run for the seat in order to ensure party unity. There were few policy differences between Barkley and Cooper, who had been deemed the most liberal Republican in the Senate by Americans for Democratic Action. During the campaign, Cooper was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on July 5, 1954. Cooper appealed to women voters, as well as black voters who appreciated his support for civil rights. He also claimed that he would be a less partisan senator than Barkley. Barkley&#x27;s personal popularity carried him to victory unseating Cooper by a vote of 434,109 (54%) to 362,948 (46%), however. Glenn Finch opined that &quot;Barkley was unbeatable in his own state, and it is probable that no other candidate could have defeated Cooper.&quot;

==Ambassador to India==
In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. During his time as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru&#x27;s sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S. Cooper initially rejected the position offered by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower.

India had only become an independent nation in 1947, and it was considered a bulwark against Communism in Asia. U.S.–India relations were strained, however, because of India&#x27;s recognition of Communist China, its opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and its resistance to foreign interference in Indochina. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; described the ambassadorship as &quot;one of the most difficult and delicate in all the diplomatic world&quot;.

Cooper married Lorraine Rowan Shevlin on March 17, 1955, in Pasadena, California, just ten days before leaving for India. Twice divorced, Shevlin was the daughter of Robert A. Rowan (a wealthy California real estate developer whose projects included the Hotel Alexandria and the Security Building), step-daughter of Vatican official Prince Domenico Orsini, and a well-known socialite. She was fluent in three languages and understood Russian. The two had dated for much of the 1950s, but Cooper was hesitant to marry because he had doubts about moving into Shevlin&#x27;s elaborate Georgetown home. (While in Washington, the unmarried Cooper permanently resided in the Dodge House Hotel.) The move to India removed this barrier, and Secretary Dulles encouraged Cooper to marry her before leaving so that the embassy in New Delhi might have a proper hostess. On April 4, 1955, the couple stopped in England on their way to India to visit with Louis Mountbatten, the last Governor-General of India. Their discussions about the situation of the Indian situation were part of the scant preparation Cooper received before arriving there.
Cooper began his service as ambassador by developing a close friendship with Prime Minister Nehru. Nehru&#x27;s respect and admiration for Cooper soon became widely known. Cooper labored to help officials in Washington, D.C. understand that India&#x27;s reluctance to align with either the West or the Communists in China and the Soviet Union was their way of exercising their newly won independence. At the same time, he defended the U.S. military buildup after World War II, its involvement in the Korean War, and its membership in mutual security pacts like NATO and SEATO as self-defense measures, not aggressive actions by the U.S. government, as the Indians widely perceived them. Cooper condemned the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s decision to sell weapons to Pakistan, which was resented by the Indians, but also felt that the Indian government took some political positions without regard to their moral implications. By late 1955, the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; reported that Indo-American relations had &quot;improved to a degree not thought possible six months ago&quot;.

In a joint communique dated December 2, 1955, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Cunha condemned statements made by Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Party First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev during an eighteen-day tour of India. Of particular interest was the communique&#x27;s reference to &quot;Portuguese provinces in the Far East&quot;. This phrase referred to Goa, a Portuguese colony in western India. Although most European nations with holdings near India had granted them to the new independent nation in 1947, Portugal refused to surrender Goa, and the region had become a source of conflict between the two nations. The joint communiqué seemed to indicate U.S. recognition of Portuguese sovereignty in Goa, which undercut Cooper&#x27;s assurances to the Indians of U.S. neutrality in the matter. Cooper himself did not know about the communiqué until he read an account of it in the Indian media and was therefore unprepared to offer an explanation for it when asked by the Indian Foreign Secretary. Cooper&#x27;s cable to Washington, D.C. about the matter was reported to have been &quot;bitter&quot;, although the contents of the cable have not been released.

The Dulles–Cuhna communique touched off anti-American demonstrations in many parts of India. On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. neutrality on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region. Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communique and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter. In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions. Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $10 million of a $50 million aid package to India; Cooper protested the withholding, and Dulles decided to pay the full amount.

Throughout the early part of 1956, Cooper strongly advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country. In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country. Cooper&#x27;s persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr., Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey, and International Cooperation Administration Director John B. Hollister.

==Later service in the Senate==

Senator Barkley died in office on April 30, 1956. Republican leaders encouraged Cooper to return from India and seek the seat, but Cooper was reluctant to give up his ambassadorship. After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower, however, Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956. Even after leaving India, he maintained close ties with the country&#x27;s leaders and was the official U.S. representative at the funerals of Prime Minister Nehru in 1964, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984.

Because Barkley&#x27;s death occurred after the filing deadline for the November elections, the Democratic State Central Committee had to choose a nominee for the now-open seat. After unsuccessfully attempting to find a compromise candidate that both the Clements and Chandler factions could support, they chose Lawrence Wetherby, whose term as governor had recently expired. Chandler, now serving his second term as governor, was angered by the choice of Wetherby, and most members of his faction either gave Wetherby lukewarm support or outright supported Cooper instead. This, combined with Cooper&#x27;s personal popularity, led to his victory over Wetherby by a vote of 538,505 (53%) to 473,140 (47%).

Upon his return to the Senate in 1957, Cooper was assigned to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 1959, he challenged Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen to become the Republican floor leader in the Senate, but lost by four votes. In a 1960 poll of fifty journalists conducted by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, Cooper was named the ablest Republican member of the Senate. He helped author and co-sponsored the National Defense Education Act. Together with Senator Jennings Randolph, he sponsored the Appalachian Regional Development Act, designed to address the prevalent poverty in Appalachia. He succeeded in gaining more state and local control over the anti-poverty group Volunteers in Service to America. He was a vigorous opponent of measures designed to weaken the Tennessee Valley Authority.

In 1960, Democrats nominated former governor Keen Johnson, then an executive with Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper&#x27;s re-election bid. Cooper had the support of organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy&#x27;s Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election. Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by a vote of 644,087 (59%) to 444,830 (41%), a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate.

Shortly after his election as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper to conduct a then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess the attitudes of the Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khrushchev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy&#x27;s decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.

President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission, which was charged with investigating Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963. Cooper attended 50 of the 94 hearings and rejected the single-bullet theory stating that &quot;there was no evidence to show that [Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally] were hit by the same bullet.&quot; Cooper publicly criticized the report&#x27;s conclusions as &quot;premature and inconclusive&quot;, and informed Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy that he strongly felt Lee Harvey Oswald had not acted alone. When Cooper expressed his same thoughts to Jacqueline Kennedy, he reportedly stated that &quot;it&#x27;s important for this nation that we bring the true murderers to justice.&quot;

As one of three Republicans on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, Cooper was involved with the investigation of Johnson aide Bobby Baker in 1964, which he decried as &quot;a whitewash&quot; after the committee blocked further investigation. He proposed the establishment of a Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965. Also in 1965, he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the Manila Conference that established the Asian Development Bank.

An advocate for small businesses and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette advertising. In March 1966, he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the United Mine Workers of America that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute to the safety of small mines, but his amendment was defeated.

Cooper voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. Cooper was one of thirteen Republican senators to vote in favor of Medicare.

In August 1970, Cooper sponsored the Health Security Act alongside fellow Senators Ted Kennedy (D-MA), William B. Saxbe (R-OH) and Ralph Yarborough (D-TX), a bill in support of the creation of a health insurance system that would have provided health care coverage to every American.

===Opposition to the Vietnam War===

Although Cooper voted in favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed escalating U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia&#x27;s strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.

In January 1966, Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador W. Averell Harriman on an official visit to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos as part of a widely publicized &quot;peace drive&quot;. This visit, along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966, reinforced Cooper&#x27;s opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia. In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26, 1966, he again urged the president to forgo his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead. Johnson was noncommittal, and that afternoon, Cooper returned to the Senate floor, urgently trying to convince the legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation, even when it meant negotiating with the Viet Cong fighters in South Vietnam, which he believed was necessary to achieve peace. Cooper advocated a three-to-five-year cease fire, enforced by the United Nations, followed by national elections as prescribed by the 1954 Geneva Convention. Ultimately, Johnson did not heed Cooper&#x27;s plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam.

In 1966, Cooper again won re-election over John Y. Brown Sr., by a vote of 483,805 (65%) to 266,079 (35%), breaking his own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying the vote of 110 of Kentucky&#x27;s 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller&#x27;s candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The Republican nomination – and the presidency – went to Richard Nixon.

As a delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield&#x27;s proposal to bring the matter of the Vietnam War before the United Nations. Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.

In the Senate, Cooper helped lead the opposition to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.
Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, aimed at curbing further escalation of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval of one of these amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia&#x27;s new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war.&quot; The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper&#x27;s health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.

Seventy-one years of age and becoming increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley. The lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again. Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months. The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate. Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The revised amendment passed 62–33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill. At Nixon&#x27;s insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48–42. Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, &quot;I feel purged inside. I&#x27;ve felt strongly about this for a long time. Now it&#x27;s in the hands of the President. He&#x27;s the only person who can do anything about ending the war now.&quot;

==Later life==

After the expiration of his term, Cooper took over the &quot;Dean Acheson chair&quot; at the prestigious Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling. In 1972, he was chosen as the commencement speaker at Centre College, where he had served as a trustee since 1961. At the ceremony, he became the first recipient of the Isaac Shelby Award, named for two-time Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby, the chair of the college&#x27;s first board of trustees. In 1973, Cooper resisted an attempt to name a federal building in his honor. Upon the completion of the dam that formed Laurel River Lake in 1977, Congress proposed naming the dam and lake after Cooper, but again, he declined. He was pleased, however, that the Somerset school system chose to name a program to teach and reinforce leadership skills the John Sherman Cooper Leadership Institute.

In April 1974, Nixon announced that he would appoint Cooper to be the US Ambassador to East Germany, but during the final negotiations between the countries for the US to establish an embassy in the country, Nixon resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship, and Cooper took leave from Covington &amp; Burling to accept it. He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976. After returning to the US, he resumed his work at Covington &amp; Burling. In his last act of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1981.
Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown Jr., the son of Cooper&#x27;s former opponent in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966, awarded Cooper the Governor&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983. Later that year, Senators Walter Huddleston of Kentucky and Howard Baker of Tennessee introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area to the Cooper National Recreation Area; Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers sponsored a parallel measure in the House. As a senator, Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval for the creation of Big South Fork. Opponents of the measure in both Kentucky and Tennessee (the recreation area spans the two states) cited a variety of reasons to retain the old name, and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper&#x27;s request.

In 1985, Cooper became the third-ever recipient of the Oxford Cup, an award recognizing outstanding past members of Beta Theta Pi. Also in 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987. A non-partisan group co-chaired by former Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Larry Forgy raised $60,000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper. A life-sized bronze bust of Cooper sculpted by John Tuska was installed at the Kentucky State Capitol in 1987. The other sculpture, a life-sized bronze statue crafted by Barney Bright, was placed in Fountain Square in Somerset.

Cooper retired from the practice of law in 1989. In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of &quot;Gentleman From Kentucky&quot;, a Kentucky Educational Television documentary about his life, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

== Death and legacy ==
On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington. He had been preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine Arnold Rowan, on February 3, 1985. On February 26, 1991, Kentucky&#x27;s two senators, Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell, gave speeches on the Senate floor praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper&#x27;s memory. Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

Because of his extensive support of rural electrification as a senator, the East Kentucky RECC was renamed the John Sherman Cooper Power Station in his honor. In 1999, the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; named Cooper one of the most influential Kentuckians of the 20th century. In 2000, Eastern Kentucky University&#x27;s Center for Kentucky History and Politics established the annual John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service in Kentucky.

Despite his patrician background, Cooper was known for being &quot;affable, frequently self-deprecating and approachable.&quot;

<text>Marvel Jackson Cooke (April 4, 1903 – November 29, 2000) was a pioneering American journalist, writer, and civil rights activist. She was the first African-American woman to work at a mainstream white-owned newspaper.

==Early life and education==

Marvel Jackson was the first black child to be born in Mankato, Minnesota. Her parents were Madison Jackson and Amy Wood Jackson. Her father was an Ohio State University law school graduate and the first black member of the South Dakota Bar, but he was unable to find employment as a black lawyer; her mother once lived on a Native American reservation as a cook and cooking teacher. Amy Wood Jackson left her position on the reservation in South Dakota due to witnessing too much unfair treatment of the Native Americans there. After leaving her cooking job, she became a homemaker and was a mother full-time for Marvel and her three sisters.

Marvel experienced the effects of racial discrimination from a young age. She was raised in an upper-class, white neighborhood in Minneapolis, where her family moved in 1907. After first purchasing their home, residents held demonstrations on the Jackson&#x27;s lawn in protest of a black family moving into the area. The schools in the area had not yet desegregated, but Marvel&#x27;s enrollment in her elementary school and high school desegregated both institutions. She overheard her favorite teacher use racial slurs when she was in elementary school, and her best childhood friend rejected her when she was seventeen because she was black.

In 1921, Marvel enrolled at the University of Minnesota. Only four other black women were enrolled with her; the entire student body at the time amounted to 20,000. She helped to establish an Alpha Kappa Alpha chapter at the university while she attended.

While enrolled in college, Marvel took a government examination to qualify for a position as a Spanish translator for the War Department. Her score qualified her for hire, but her boss gave her a job as a file clerk after lying and telling her the translation department was not yet established. Cooke later found out that the department was established with only white women on staff; she contacted Senator Henrik Shipstead, who responded and helped reassign her to the translation department.

In 1925, Marvel graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in English, at the age of 22.

==Career==
Cooke was offered a job as assistant to W. E. B. Du Bois, editor of the NAACP magazine &quot;The Crisis&quot;, and in 1926 moved to New York City, settling in Harlem, during the Harlem Renaissance. Before working at &quot;The Crisis&quot;, she had neither taken a journalism course nor had she worked for a newspaper. Her ability as a writer was recognized by Du Bois, who put her in charge of a column in the magazine, where her brief tenure included writing critiques of works by the literary giants of the day, including Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and Dorothy Parker. In addition to writing the column, named &quot;In the Magazines,&quot; Cooke laid out the newspaper.

Mentored by Du Bois, she became friendly with leading writers and artists, including Paul Robeson, Countee Cullen, Elizabeth Catlett, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps, and James Weldon Johnson. She broke off her engagement to (later NAACP leader) Roy Wilkins because she thought him too conservative.

In 1927, she went to work on the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;, where she was the first woman reporter in their 40-year history. In 1929, she married Jamaican-born Cecil Cooke – a graduate of Columbia University, who was the world&#x27;s fastest quarter-miler when she met him; their marriage would last until his death in 1978. After marrying, they moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, where Marvel taught history, English and Latin in the high-school department of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College.

Returning to New York and the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot; in 1931, she helped found the first chapter in New York of the Newspaper Guild and was involved in strike action at the &quot;News&quot;, joining the picket for 11 weeks when the editorial workers union was locked out; the strike was finally ended on Christmas Eve 1934. Cooke disliked the crime stories she was assigned by the &quot;News&quot;, finding distasteful the paper&#x27;s handling of such stories, and preferring to expand the paper&#x27;s coverage of the arts – for instance, traveling at her own cost to cover Marian Anderson&#x27;s historic open-air concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939. She also reported stories that she believed would be informative for the black community, publishing a front-page story that exposed problematic working conditions for the Apollo Theater&#x27;s dancers and a series that analyzed rising crime rates in Harlem. Cooke eventually left the paper for good in 1940. She disliked a sensational headline (&quot;Killed Sweetheart, Slept With Body&quot;) and the sensational nature of the paper overall.

While working for the Amsterdam News, Cooke interviewed a wealthy woman at a Park Avenue apartment. She was not allowed to enter through the front door of the building because of her race, so she called the interviewee and cancelled the meeting. The interviewee then forced the apartment&#x27;s management to allow Cooke in through the front.

From 1942 to 1947, Cooke worked on &quot;The People&#x27;s Voice&quot; (a weekly owned by Adam Clayton Powell), as assistant managing editor. Crime news for &quot;The People&#x27;s Voice&quot; was limited to a single brief column, suiting Cooke&#x27;s journalistic preferences much more than the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot;. The newspaper went out of business in 1947. In 1950 she was hired by the New York paper &quot;The Daily Compass&quot;, becoming the first African-American woman to serve as a reporter for a mainstream white-owned newspaper; at the time she was one of only two black journalists employed there, along with Richard Carter. Her first series for the paper, beginning April 16, was &quot;Occupation: Streetwalker&quot; which chronicled the process of prostitution in the area; she also published a piece that detailed black children&#x27;s drug use entitled &quot;From Candy to Heroin.&quot; New York City officials began a program to decrease teenage drug addiction after &quot;From Candy to Heroin&quot; was published. The following year, to highlight the exploitation of black domestic workers in white homes she got herself hired along with others seeking work by the day and then described her experiences in a compelling five-part series for the &quot;Daily Compass&quot; entitled &quot;The Bronx Slave Market&quot;, which was promoted with signs that said: &quot;Read: I Was a Slave, by Marvel Cooke.&quot; Cooke revealed many upsetting working conditions for domestic laborers, including how the white women who hired black women would pay significantly less than the rate established by the New York State Employment Service. Employers would also manipulate the hands on their clocks in order to trick workers into laboring an hour for free. In addition to publishing the piece, the newspaper published an editorial directly addressed to Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer in an effort to curb the exploitation. The combined series and editorial led the Domestic Workers Union and the State Employment Agency to create courses for household workers and the American Labor Party sought standardized wages.

She remained with the &quot;Daily Compass&quot; until its closure in November 1952.

===Activism===

While working at the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot; in the 1930s, Cooke not only helped create a local chapter of the Newspaper Guild, the labor union of newspaper journalists, but also held union meetings in her home and subsequently participated in an eleven-week strike, during which she joined the Communist Party. Cooke joined the Communist Party in 1936 after convincing from journalist Benjamin J. Davis. She joined even though she may have been fired if her employers knew of her political affiliation.

She also formed a writing group to support creative authors; one of the participants was the first black writer to publish a Book-of-the-Month-Club selection, Richard Wright.

In the 1953, she became the New York director of the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions. The National Council brought together artists, scientists, and professionals for political unity; Arthur Miller and John Randolph were members.

In 1953, when she was called twice to testify regarding her involvement with the Communist Party before Senator Joseph McCarthy, in New York and Washington DC, she pleaded the Fifth Amendment.

Cooke began working with the Angela Davis Defense Committee in 1969 and she volunteered as national legal defense secretary of the Angela Davis Defense Fund in 1971. She coordinated committee activities in New York, raised money for Angela Davis&#x27;s defense, and organized a rally at Madison Square Gardens. The rally had 16,000 participants and raised $40,000. In her later years, Cooke became national vice-chairman of the American-Soviet Friendship Committee.

Cooke died of leukemia in New York in 2000, at the age of 97, having lived most of her life at 409 Edgecombe Avenue, the legendary apartment building in Sugar Hill, that was home to many other black luminaries.

<text>Holy Saturday (), also known as Great and Holy Saturday (also Holy and Great Saturday), Low Saturday, the Great Sabbath, Hallelujah Saturday (in Portugal and Brazil), Saturday of the Glory, Sábado de Gloria, and Black Saturday or Easter Eve, and called &quot;Joyous Saturday&quot;, &quot;the Saturday of Light&quot;, and &quot;Mega Sabbatun&quot; among Coptic Christians, is the final day of Holy Week, between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, when Christians prepare for the latter.

The day commemorates the Harrowing of Hell while Jesus Christ&#x27;s body lay in the tomb. Christians of the Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican and Reformed denominations begin the celebration of the Easter Vigil service on Holy Saturday, which provides a transition to the season of Eastertide; in the Moravian Christian tradition, graves are decorated with flowers during the day of Holy Saturday and the celebration of the sunrise service starts before dawn on Easter Sunday.

==Terminology==
===Jewish Nazarenes===

Whereas the Great Sabbath in Jewish liturgy occurs the sabbath before the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the sabbath in the midst of the feast is celebrated as a . In Hebrews 4, Jewish Christians are admonished to make every effort to enter this sabbath and every sabbath in repentance, and Psalm 95 is excerpted by the author of Hebrews: &quot;today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.&quot; The entire Psalm 95 is read on Friday afternoon every week in synagogue prayers immediately before receiving the sabbath in rabbinic Judaism.

===Eastern traditions===
Eastern Orthodoxy

In Eastern Orthodoxy this day, known as Holy and Great Saturday, is also called The Great Sabbath since it is on this day that Christ &quot;rested&quot; physically in the tomb. But it is also believed that it was on this day he performed in spirit the Harrowing of Hell and raised up to Paradise, having liberated those who had been held captive.

Oriental Orthodoxy

In the Coptic, Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches, this day is known as Joyous Saturday, otherwise known as the night of light and joy. It is known as the Saturday of Good Tidings or Gospel Saturday in the Syriac Church, which is also a day where Syriac Christians remember their departed.

Syriac Christianity

In the Syriac Christian tradition, this day is known as ܫܲܒܬ݂ܵܐ ܕܢܘܼܗܪܵܐ &quot;šábbṯā d-núhrā&quot; or the Saturday of Light.

===Western traditions===

In Western traditions, the day is usually called Holy Saturday, although in the Moravian Church, the day is referred to as the Great Sabbath and in the Anglican Communion, the Book of Common Prayer refers to the day as Easter Even. Although the term Easter Saturday is usually applied to the Saturday in Easter week, in English-speaking countries it is sometimes applied to Holy Saturday, including in legislation in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, and by Australian government agencies. In the Catholic tradition, the Blessed Virgin Mary is honored on this day under the title Our Lady of Solitude, referring to her grief at the death of her son.

==Religious and cultural practices==

===Eastern traditions===
====Eastern Orthodox====
Matins of Holy and Great Saturday (in parishes usually held on Friday evening) takes the form of a funeral service for Christ. The entire service takes place around the &quot;Epitaphios&quot;, an icon in the form of a cloth embroidered with the image of Christ prepared for burial. The first part of the service consists of chanting Psalm 118, as usual at both Saturday matins and at funerals, but interspersed with hymns (&quot;enkomia&quot; or &quot;lamentations&quot;) between the verses. The predominant theme of the service is not so much one of mourning, but of watchful expectation:

Today Thou dost keep holy the seventh day,&lt;br&gt; Which Thou has blessed of old by resting from Thy works.&lt;br&gt; Thou bringest all things into being and Thou makest all things new,&lt;br&gt; Observing the Sabbath rest, my Saviour, and restoring strength.

Near the end of matins, at the end of the Great Doxology, the Epitaphios is taken up and carried in procession around the outside of the church, while the Trisagion is sung, as is done when carrying the body to the cemetery in an Orthodox burial.
On Saturday, a vesperal Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great is celebrated, called the First Resurrection Service (Greek: ), named so because chronologically it was composed earlier than the Paschal Canon by St. John of Damascus rather than because it occurs earlier liturgically. This is the longest Divine Liturgy of the entire year and is performed later than on any other day of the year, &quot;at the tenth hour of the day&quot;. 

On &#x27;Lord, I call&#x27;, four of the usual Sunday hymns from the Octoechos are sung, followed by four for the day, the doxasticon from Lauds the night before and the usual dogmatikon. After the Little Entrance, there is no Evening Prokimenon, but there are 15 Old Testament readings that recall the history of salvation, many of which relate to Passover, baptism, or the Resurrection (note that book names here are given according to the Septuagint):

* Genesis 1:1-13 – God creates the universe
* Isaiah 60:1-16 – Isaiah prophecies a golden age for Judah
* Exodus 12:1-11 – God gives instructions for the first Passover
* Jonah 1:1-4:11 – Jonah spends three days in the belly of a sea monster
* Joshua 5:10-15 – Joshua celebrates Passover
* Exodus 13:20-15:19 – The Israelites cross the Red Sea (note that the final 19 verses are sung as a canticle)
* Zephaniah 3:8-15 – God promises refuge to Israel
* 3 Kings 17:8-24 – Elijah meets the widow of Zarephath and resurrects her son
* Isaiah 61:10-62:5 – Isaiah celebrates a coming salvation
* Genesis 22:1-18 – God tests Abraham by telling him to sacrifice his son Isaac
* Isaiah 61:1-9 – Isaiah explains the role of a prophet and the relationship Israel will have with God
* 4 Kings 4:8-37 – Elisha resurrects the son of the Shunamite woman
* Isaiah 63:11-64:5 – Isaiah remembers the crossing of the Red Sea and prays for his people
* Jeremiah 31:31-34 – Jeremiah prophecies the new covenant
* Daniel 3:1-89 – The Three Holy Youths are cast into a fiery furnace (note that the final 33 verses (and three extra-biblical ones) are sung as a canticle)

In place of the Trisagion, the baptismal hymn &#x27;As many as have been baptised into Christ have put on Christ. Alleluia.&#x27; is sung. The Prokimenon is from Psalm 65 (66), made up of verses from the First Antiphon of Pascha: &#x27;Let all the earth worship Thee: sing of Thee and praise Thy Name, O most High.&#x27; The Epistle is Romans 6:3-11, St. Paul&#x27;s explanation of the role of death and resurrection in baptism. This is the standard epistle read at baptisms.

Unique to this day, the Alleluia is replaced with Psalm 81 (82) being sung: &quot;Arise, O God, judge Thou the earth: for Thou shalt have an inheritance in all the nations&quot; while the deacon performs a censing of the church. In Slavic tradition where the service is begun in dark vestments, the hangings, altar cloths, curtain and vestments are changed to bright. In Greek and Arabic tradition, the clergy strew laurel leaves (a symbol of victory) and flower petals all over the church to symbolize Jesus&#x27; triumph over death, often accompanied – especially in Cypriot custom – by the congregation making a loud noise by stamping their feet, banging on pews and sticks, and even clanging pots and pans, all to symbolize Christ shattering the gates and breaking the chains of hell. 

The liturgical atmosphere changes from sorrow to joy at this service. The faithful continue to fast and the Paschal greeting, &quot;Christ is risen!&quot;, is not exchanged until after midnight during the Paschal Vigil since this service represents the proclamation of Jesus&#x27; victory over death to those in Hades. The Resurrection has not yet been announced to those on earth, which takes place during the Paschal Vigil.

The Gospel reading is Matthew 28:1-20, St. Matthew&#x27;s account of the Resurrection. While the first fifteen verses are not read at any other time, the final five verses form one of the Sunday Matins Gospels and are the standard Gospel reading for baptisms.

The Cherubic Hymn is replaced by &#x27;Let all mortal flesh keep silence&#x27;, an analogous hymn from the ancient Liturgy of Saint James, and the Hymn to the Theotokos is replaced with the irmos from Ode 9 of the Canon the night before, Christ&#x27;s promise to His Mother that she will be magnified following His Resurrection, but other than that the Liturgy proceeds as any other Liturgy of St. Basil. After the service, in many places, it is customary to break and bless bread as at a Vigil, but to omit the blessing of oil.

Great Lent was originally the period of catechesis for new converts in order to prepare them for baptism and chrismation and when there are converts received, that occurs during the Old testament readings during the vesperal divine liturgy. Before the midnight service, the faithful gather in church for the reading of the Acts of the Apostles in its entirety. Preceding midnight the Paschal Vigil begins with the Midnight Office, during which the Canon of Holy Saturday is repeated, toward the end of which the epitaphios is removed from the center of the church and placed on the altar table where it remains until the Ascension. Then, all of the candles and lights in the church are extinguished, and all wait in darkness and silence for the proclamation of the Resurrection of Christ.

===Western traditions===

In the Catholic Church, the altar remains stripped completely bare (following the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper on Maundy Thursday). The celebration of the Sacraments is extremely limited: Holy Communion is given only as Viaticum to the dying; while Penance, Anointing of the Sick and baptism may be administered because they, like Viaticum, are helpful to ensuring salvation for the dying. The day is the second day of the Paschal fast as outlined in Sacrosanctum Concilium, Article 110. In the Roman Catholic Church, plenary indulgence is obtained if two or more faithfuls pray the Holy Rosary or if the faithful attends the celebration of the Easter Vigil and renews their baptismal promises, which are part of the liturgy of the same Mass.

Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, and other Churches observe many of the same customs as the Catholic Church; however, their altars may be covered in black instead of being stripped. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer uses Easter Even to designate the day. In some Anglican churches, including the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, provision is made for a simple Liturgy of the Word on this day, with readings commemorating the burial of Christ. Daily Offices are still observed. In the Moravian Church, the day is known as Great Sabbath.

In the Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist traditions, Holy Saturday lasts until nightfall, after which the Easter Vigil is celebrated, marking the official start of the Easter season.

In the Moravian Church, people decorate the graves in God&#x27;s Acre with flowers; the sunrise service, the first liturgy of Paschaltide, begins before dawn of Easter Sunday.

====Black Saturday====
In the predominantly Catholic Philippines, the day is legally and colloquially known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, given the colour&#x27;s role in mourning. It commemorates the day that Jesus lay in his tomb. Traditional taboos from the previous day are carried over and are sometimes broken; swimming is allowed in the afternoon. Most commercial establishments resume operations, with smaller enterprises remaining closed until or before Easter. Television and radio stations broadcast on shorter hours with special programming or remain off-air.

In predominantly Catholic Poland, Święconka (), meaning &quot;the blessing of the Easter baskets&quot;, on Holy Saturday, is one of the most enduring and beloved traditions. Baskets containing eggs, ham, bread, sweet breads, horseradish, and lamb cakes or butter lambs are brought to church to be blessed.

<text>Mike Jittlov (born June 8, 1948) is an American animator and the creator of short films and one feature-length film using forms of special effects animation, including stop-motion animation, rotoscoping, and pixilation. He is best known for the 1988 feature-length film &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;, based on his 1979 short film of the same name.

==Life==
Born in Los Angeles, Jittlov became a math major at UCLA. Jittlov took an animation course to satisfy his art requirement. He made a super-8 film, &quot;The Leap&quot;, enlarged to 16mm to participate in film festivals in the early 1970s. Jittlov entered a 16mm film made for his UCLA class, &quot;Good Grief&quot;, into Academy Awards competition. That short made it to the professional finals for nomination, the first of several of his short films to do so. Afterwards, Jittlov bought his own 16mm camera, designed his own multiplane animation system for $200, and began his career.

Some of his other original film shorts, including &quot;The Interview&quot;, &quot;Swing Shift&quot;, &quot;Animato&quot;, and &quot;Time Tripper&quot; (released separately and as a collection called &quot;Animato&quot;) won many top awards and repeat film festival screenings, bringing him to the attention of The Walt Disney Studio. In 1978, Jittlov co-starred on Disney&#x27;s two-hour TV extravaganza, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 50&quot;, with the short film &quot;Mouse Mania&quot;, creating and animating the first stop-motion Mickey Mouse, along with 1,000 other Disney toys marching around a psychiatrist&#x27;s office. The short is now featured on the Disney DVD &quot;Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two&quot;. Since Disney did not usually allow individual creators to receive credit on their television productions (preferring a generic thanks to &quot;the many Disney animators who made this possible&quot;) Mike put his and partner Deven Cheregino&#x27;s name on the toys in the final production number, where they could not be easily edited out.

In late 1979, he co-starred again on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Major Effects&quot; television special – this time introducing the world to the green-robed &quot;Wizard of Speed and Time&quot; via the short film version. With an improved soundtrack, the short was released to 16mm film collectors in 1980, along with four of his other short films.

Jittlov also created the inaugural short film played on the cable TV Disney Channel. It featured an animated satellite shaped like Mickey Mouse&#x27;s head, which was later reproduced for the special features of the DVD version of Disney&#x27;s 1937 film, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. The Mickey Satellite film played to park-goers waiting in line at Space Mountain for years, and is still shown to Walt Disney Parks and Resorts employees during orientation. The prop was also used in a scene in &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;.

Jittlov is best known for his feature film &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;, which he directed and starred in. The film did poorly in theaters but has established a cult following since its release on videotape and laserdisc. It can often be found online. It is known for being self-referential. 

He later worked as a special effects technician on the film &quot;Ghost&quot;, and in fan films including &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s Psychic Hotline&quot;.

Jittlov maintains a distinctive appearance at science fiction conventions by wearing his traditional green jacket and green shoes, similar to the ones seen in &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;. He was an early Internet user, with his own website, and frequent poster to his own Usenet group, alt.fan.mike-jittlov. He is also a prolific practitioner of origami.

<text>Eugenio Beltrami (16 November 1835 – 18 February 1900) was an Italian mathematician notable for his work concerning differential geometry and mathematical physics. His work was noted especially for clarity of exposition. He was the first to prove consistency of non-Euclidean geometry by modeling it on a surface of constant curvature, the pseudosphere, and in the interior of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional unit sphere, the so-called Beltrami–Klein model. He also developed singular value decomposition for matrices, which has been subsequently rediscovered several times. Beltrami&#x27;s use of differential calculus for problems of mathematical physics indirectly influenced development of tensor calculus by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita.

== Life ==

Beltrami was born in 1835 in Cremona (Lombardy), then a part of the Austrian Empire, and now part of Italy. Both parents were artists Giovanni Beltrami and the Venetian Elisa Barozzi. He began studying mathematics at University of Pavia in 1853, but was expelled from Ghislieri College in 1856 due to his political opinions—he was sympathetic with the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. During this time he was taught and influenced by Francesco Brioschi. He had to discontinue his studies because of financial hardship and spent the next several years as a secretary working for the Lombardy–Venice railroad company. He was appointed to the University of Bologna as a professor in 1862, the year he published his first research paper. Throughout his life, Beltrami had various professorial positions at the universities of Pisa, Rome and Pavia. From 1891 until the end of his life, Beltrami lived in Rome. He became the president of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1898 and a senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1899.

== Contributions to non-Euclidean geometry ==

In 1868 Beltrami published two memoirs (written in Italian; French translations by J. Hoüel appeared in 1869) dealing with consistency and interpretations of non-Euclidean geometry of János Bolyai and Nikolai Lobachevsky. In his &quot;Essay on an interpretation of non-Euclidean geometry&quot;, Beltrami proposed that this geometry could be realized on a surface of constant negative curvature, a pseudosphere. For Beltrami&#x27;s concept, lines of the geometry are represented by geodesics on the pseudosphere and theorems of non-Euclidean geometry can be proved within ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space, and not derived in an axiomatic fashion, as Lobachevsky and Bolyai had done previously. In 1840, Ferdinand Minding already considered geodesic triangles on the pseudosphere and remarked that the corresponding &quot;trigonometric formulas&quot; are obtained from the corresponding formulas of spherical trigonometry by replacing the usual trigonometric functions with hyperbolic functions; this was further developed by Delfino Codazzi in 1857, but apparently neither of them noticed the association with Lobachevsky&#x27;s work. In this way, Beltrami attempted to demonstrate that two-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry is as valid as the Euclidean geometry of the space, and in particular, that Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate could not be derived from the other axioms of Euclidean geometry. It is often stated that this proof was incomplete due to the singularities of the pseudosphere, which means that geodesics could not be extended indefinitely. However, John Stillwell remarks that Beltrami must have been well aware of this difficulty, which is also manifested by the fact that the pseudosphere is topologically a cylinder, and not a plane, and he spent a part of his memoir designing a way around it. By a suitable choice of coordinates, Beltrami showed how the metric on the pseudosphere can be transferred to the unit disk and that the singularity of the pseudosphere corresponds to a horocycle on the non-Euclidean plane. On the other hand, in the introduction to his memoir, Beltrami states that it would be impossible to justify &quot;the rest of Lobachevsky&#x27;s theory&quot;, i.e., the non-Euclidean geometry of space, by this method.

In the second memoir published during the same year (1868), &quot;Fundamental theory of spaces of constant curvature&quot;, Beltrami continued this logic and gave an abstract proof of equiconsistency of hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry for any dimension. He accomplished this by introducing several models of non-Euclidean geometry that are now known as the Beltrami–Klein model, the Poincaré disk model, and the Poincaré half-plane model, together with transformations that relate them. For the half-plane model, Beltrami cited a note by Joseph Liouville in the treatise of Gaspard Monge on differential geometry. Beltrami also showed that &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean geometry is realized on a horosphere of the (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional hyperbolic space, so the logical relation between consistency of the Euclidean and the non-Euclidean geometries is symmetric. Beltrami acknowledged the influence of Bernhard Riemann&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;Habilitation&quot; lecture &quot;On the hypotheses on which geometry is based&quot; (1854; published posthumously in 1868).

Although today Beltrami&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; is recognized as very important for the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the reception at the time was less enthusiastic. Luigi Cremona objected to perceived circular reasoning, which even forced Beltrami to delay the publication of the &quot;Essay&quot; by one year. Subsequently, Felix Klein failed to acknowledge Beltrami&#x27;s priority in construction of the projective disk model of the non-Euclidean geometry. This reaction can be attributed in part to the novelty of Beltrami&#x27;s reasoning, which was similar to the ideas of Riemann concerning abstract manifolds. J. Hoüel published Beltrami&#x27;s proof in his French translation of works of Lobachevsky and Bolyai.

<doc id="543762" wikidata="Q1035310" url="?curid=543762" title="Carach Angren">
<text>Carach Angren () is a Dutch symphonic black metal band, founded in 2003 by two members of the now-defunct bands Inger Indolia and Vaultage. Their style is characterized by prominent usage of orchestral arrangements, black (sometimes death) metal vocals, and guitar riffs. Their studio albums are concept albums with lyrics based on ghost stories and folklore, such as the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. The band sets itself apart from other symphonic black metal artists with the usage of multiple languages such as English, French, German, and Dutch. Most songs are based on English, with transitions into other languages during chorus and bridge sections.

Drummer Ivo &quot;Namtar&quot; Wijers quit the group in February 2020, leaving the band with two current members, singer Dennis &quot;Seregor&quot; Droomers and keyboardist Clemens &quot;Ardek&quot; Wijers.

==Name==
The name &quot;Carach Angren&quot; is derived from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and means &quot;Iron Jaws&quot; in the Elvish language of Sindarin. In the Tolkien universe, &quot;Carach Angren&quot;, also called &quot;Isenmouthe&quot; (both meaning the same) is the name of a fortified pass into the plateau of Gorgoroth in North-Western Mordor.

==History==

Carach Angren was formed in 2003, in the Dutch municipality of Landgraaf, after two members of Vaultage, Lee Hartney and Inger Indolia, started a side project based on their shared love of legends and black metal. Eventually, Carach Angren was more successful, so both stepped down from Vaultage.

In 2004, Carach Angren released their first EP, &quot;The Chase Vault Tragedy&quot;. The EP is a concept album, telling the story of mysteriously moving coffins known as the Chase Vault Mystery. In 2005, the band released a second EP, &quot;Ethereal Veiled Existence&quot;, covering the story of the Brown Lady. In 2007, Carach Angren was signed to Maddening Media, a German independent record label. Carach Angren recorded their first full-length album for this label, &quot;Lammendam&quot;, which received positive international reviews following its release in 2008.

Their second album, &quot;Death Came Through a Phantom Ship&quot;, was released on 26 February 2010. To support the album, Carach Angren toured Europe under &quot;A Declaration of Hate&quot; tour, with extreme metal bands Dark Funeral, Zonaria and Nefarium.

On 18 May 2012, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Where the Corpses Sink Forever&quot;. This concept album covers themes surrounding war, including war, death, and suffering.

On 17 February 2015, the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;This Is No Fairytale&quot; was available for streaming on Metal Hammer. The album was officially released on 23 February 2015. The album is a modern interpretation of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale with themes of domestic abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, sexual child abuse, suicide, child abduction and cannibalism.

On 16 June 2017, their fifth studio album, &quot;Dance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten&quot;, was released. This album diverges from the previous &quot;storytelling&quot; theme of the previous albums, but remains a concept album, with ghost themes, including the Blood Queen and Charles Francis Coghlan.

On 10 February 2020, drummer Ivo &quot;Namtar&quot; Wijers left the band. According to him, the departure was motivated by &quot;dissatisfaction with the music industry&quot;. Seregor and Ardek posted the announcement on the band&#x27;s official website, revealing that the exit was a friendly one, saying, &quot;Although we are very sorry for your departure, we respect your decision&quot;.

In late 2019 the band announced they had begun work on a sixth studio album, scheduled to be released in mid-2020. Its name and release date were unveiled on 20 February 2020; &quot;Franckensteina Strataemontanus&quot;. The album is a concept album inspired by the life of Johann Konrad Dippel, and was released through Season of Mist on 26 June.

<doc id="543769" wikidata="Q440720" url="?curid=543769" title="Susan Howard">
<text>Jeri Lynn Mooney (born 1942), better known as Susan Howard, is an American actress, writer, and political activist. She portrayed Donna Culver Krebbs on &quot;Dallas&quot; (1979–1987) and co-starred on &quot;Petrocelli&quot; (1974–1976). She is also a screenwriter and member of the Writers Guild of America.

==Biography==
Jeri Lynn Mooney was born in Marshall, Texas, to parents Cassell C. and Melba Ruth &quot;Peg&quot; Mooney. She has an older brother, James. Her family is of Irish ancestry from Cork. Mooney was recognized for her acting talent while growing up in Marshall. She won a University Interscholastic League award for Best Actress while in high school. Upon graduating from Marshall High School in 1960, she attended the University of Texas for two years, where she studied drama and was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, before leaving for Los Angeles to become an acting student at the Los Angeles Repertory Company. She later took the stage name Susan Howard as her father had nicknamed her Susie and Howard was a family name.

===Television===
Howard had a number of notable guest appearances on television shows during the 1960s and early 1970s: &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (1967), &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1968), &quot;Star Trek&quot; ‘’Day of the Dove’’ (1968), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1969), &quot;Mannix&quot; (1969), &quot;&quot; (1972), and &quot;Columbo&quot; (1972). She played the first female Klingon (&quot;Mara&quot;) on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and the only one to ever speak.

In 1973, she appeared as Evan Sands on Lorne Greene&#x27;s series &quot;Griff&quot; in the episode &quot;Who Framed Billy the Kid?&quot;, with Nick Nolte as Billy Randolph.

In 1974, Howard was cast as the co-star of the series &quot;Petrocelli&quot;. Her performance was nominated for both the Golden Globe and Emmy awards. Despite critical acclaim for Howard, the series was cancelled in 1976.

In 1978, Howard played a key role as Professor Kingsfield&#x27;s daughter Susan in season 1, episode 10 of &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;. In 1979, she appeared on &quot;Dallas&quot; as Donna Culver. The producers of the show liked her performance so much that her guest spot was expanded to an eight-year stint; she has the distinction of being the only &quot;Dallas&quot; cast member to have written for the series (&quot;Sitting Ducks&quot; and &quot;The Ten Percent Solution&quot;). In 1987, the show decided not to renew her contract. She has blamed this decision on her opposition to what she saw as pro-abortion stories involving her character.

==Personal life==
Howard was married to actor Charles Howerton from 1962 to 1964. They had one daughter, Lynn. In 1974, she married independent film executive Calvin Chrane. She and her husband have lived in Boerne, Texas, since 1998.

She is a member of the Writers Guild of America and wrote two episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot;.

===Politics===
Since leaving television, Howard has become an increasingly active supporter of conservative causes, especially for gun rights. In 1989, she was co-host of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;. Howard has been active in the leadership of both the National Rifle Association and the Texas Republican Party. Howard has served as a commissioner of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Commission on the Arts. She became involved in the NRA after meeting Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre at the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans.

<text>A residential area is a land used in which housing predominates, as opposed to industrial and commercial areas.

Housing may vary significantly between, and through, residential areas. These include single-family housing, multi-family residential, or mobile homes. Zoning for residential use may permit some services or work opportunities or may totally exclude business and industry. It may permit high density land use or only permit low density uses. Residential zoning usually includes a smaller FAR (floor area ratio) than business, commercial or industrial/manufacturing zoning. The area may be large or small.

==Overview==

In certain residential areas, especially rural, large tracts of land may have no services whatever, such that residents seeking services must use a motor vehicle or other transportation, so the need for transportation has resulted in land development following existing or planned transport infrastructure such as rail and road. Development patterns may be regulated by restrictive covenants contained in the deeds to the properties in the development and may also result from or be reinforced by zoning. Restrictive covenants are not easily changed when the agreement of all property owners (many of whom may not live in the area) is required. The area so restricted may be large or small.

Residential areas may be subcategorized in the concentric zone model and other schemes of urban geography.

== Residential development ==


=== History ===

Residential development is real estate development for residential purposes. Some such developments are called a subdivision, when the land is divided into lots with houses constructed on each lot. Such developments became common during the late nineteenth century, particularly in the form of streetcar suburbs.

In previous centuries, residential development was mainly of two kinds. Rich people bought a townlot, hired an architect and/or contractor, and built a bespoke / customized house or mansion for their family. Poor urban people lived in shantytowns or in tenements built for rental. Single-family houses were seldom built on speculation, that is for future sale to residents not yet identified. When cities and the middle class expanded greatly and mortgage loans became commonplace, a method that had been rare became commonplace to serve the expanding demand for home ownership.

Post–World War II economic expansion in major cities of the United States, especially New York City and Los Angeles produced a demand for thousands of new homes, which was largely met by speculative building. Its large-scale practitioners disliked the term &quot;property speculator&quot; and coined the new name &quot;residential development&quot; for their activity. Entire farms and ranches were subdivided and developed, often with one individual or company controlling all aspects of entitlement (permits), land development (streets and grading), infrastructure (utilities and sewage disposal), and housing. Communities like Levittown, Long Island or Lakewood south of Los Angeles saw new homes sold at unprecedented rates—more than one a day. Many techniques which had made the automobile affordable made housing affordable: standardization of design and small, repetitive assembly tasks, advertising, and a smooth flow of capital. Mass production resulted in a similar uniformity of product, and a more comfortable lifestyle than cramped apartments in the cities. With the advent of government-backed mortgages, it could actually be cheaper to own a house in a new residential development than to rent.

As with other products, continual refinements appeared. Curving streets, greenbelt parks, neighborhood pools, and community entry monumentation appeared. Diverse floor plans with differing room counts, and multiple elevations (different exterior &quot;looks&quot; for the same plan) appeared. Developers remained competitive with each other on everything, including location, community amenities, kitchen appliance packages, and price.

Today, a typical residential development in the United States might include traffic calming features such as a slowly winding street, dead-end road, or looped road lined with homes.

Suburban developments help form the stereotypical image of a &quot;suburban America&quot; and are generally associated with the American middle-class. Most offer homes in a narrow range of age, price, size and features, thus potential residents having different needs, wishes or resources must look elsewhere. Some residential developments are gated communities or residential communities.

=== Problems with residential developments ===

Criticisms of residential developments may include the following:

* They do not mesh well with the greater community. Some are isolated, with only one entrance, or otherwise connected with the rest of the community in few ways.
* Being commuter towns, they serve no more purpose for the greater community than other specialized settlements do and thus require residents to go to the greater community for commercial or other purposes, whereas mixed-use developments provide for commerce and other activities, so residents need not go as often to the greater community.
* Lodging advancements can frequently be isolated with only one way in and one way out. Without great streets and ways to different regions, getting around can take a pointlessly lengthy timespan - making it harder for individuals to walk and cycle.
* Front nurseries with low walls will quite often be very much taken care of, with inhabitants keeping an eye on their front nurseries and covertly attempting to outperform their neighbors. Numerous designers lessen costs by eliminating these unobtrusive yet significant qualifications among public and confidential space. The outcome is many times puts that become unused, disliked and neglected.
* Current roads are packed with unattended vehicles, which is not just unattractive but blocks pavements, makes roads more unsafe for kids and is also often the source of arguments with neighbours.
* Everybody cherishes a tree-lined road, however new improvements frequently overlook them. Numerous expressways specialists deter trees and hedgerows making green and verdant roads progressively difficult to come by. As an outcome, many modern developments are dominated by hard materials and often appear colorless.

<text>is a national university in Niigata, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. It was established in 1949 and has its major origins in Niigata Medical College (established in 1922) and in Niigata Higher School (established in 1919). It is one of the largest Japanese national universities on the Sea of Japan.

The university comprises nine faculties and seven graduate schools (as of April 2010). The student enrollment is about 12,000.

== History ==
The oldest origin of the university was Kyoritsu Hospital (a temporary hospital) founded in 1870. It was reestablished in 1873 as Private Niigata Hospital, which became a prefectural hospital in 1877.

In 1901 five national medical schools were established in Chiba, Sendai, Okayama, Kanazawa and Nagasaki. The municipal and prefectural governments of Niigata demanded a national medical school from the Ministry of Education, but the plan was deferred because of the Russo-Japanese War. Later in 1910 Niigata Medical School was founded, and the former Niigata Hospital became its clinical facility. In 1922 the medical school was chartered as .

The municipal and prefectural governments of Niigata and the local industrial firms further wanted the medical college to be developed into an imperial university (so-called Hokuriku Imperial University) and competed with Kanazawa. But the trials did not succeed until the end of World War II.

In 1949 seven colleges (Niigata Medical College, Niigata Higher School, Niigata First Normal School, Niigata Second Normal School, Niigata Youth Normal School, Niigata Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry College, and Nagaoka College of Technology) were integrated to constitute Niigata University under Japan&#x27;s new educational system. The university was inaugurated with the Faculties of Humanities, Education, Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture.

In 1965 the Faculty of Dentistry was established. The faculties (except Medicine and Dentistry) began moving to new Ikarashi Campus in 1968, and the removals finished in the 1980s. In 1977 the Faculty of Humanities was reorganized into the Faculty of Law and Literature, then divided into three faculties (Humanities, Law, and Economics) in 1980. The university became a National University Corporation in 2004. In 2017, the College of Creative Studies was established.

<text>ESCP Business School (; ) is a French business school and &quot;grande école&quot; founded in Paris and based across Europe with campuses in Paris, Berlin, London, Madrid, Turin, and Warsaw. Established in 1819, it is considered the world&#x27;s oldest business school. ESCP Business School runs BSc, MBA, Executive MBA, master&#x27;s degree programs in finance and management, executive education programs, and PhD programs.

==History==

The school was established in Paris on 1 December 1819 by two former Napoleonic soldiers, Germain Legret and Amédée Brodart. Germain Legret had founded two business schools in Paris in 1815 and 1818, but both closed their doors rapidly. ESCP offered entrepreneurship education in the 1820s. It was modelled on the first grande école, the École Polytechnique, founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge, but was initially more modest, in large part because it had not been supported by the state. The school had gained international exposure since the 1820s, but it was not the only business school open to international students. Its stature and importance ascended during the 19th century and it moved to its current Parisian location on the Avenue de la République in 1898.

In 1828, the project to put the school under the authority of the French Ministry of Commerce and Industry failed. The school remained independent by the intervention of Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, who took it over. Several times during the first half of the 19th century, French political developments resulted in plans to group ESCP with elite French engineering schools such as the École Polytechnique or the École Centrale Paris, but this ultimately did not happen. At the time, engineering schools in France and in Europe taught future businessmen. From 1838, the French state began to fund scholarships meant for ESCP&#x27;s students.

In 1869, the Paris Chamber of Commerce took over the school, aiming to train future business leaders in modern methods in commerce and industry. In 1892, ESCP set up selective admissions processes, which continued to be retained and, today, take the form of competitive exams.

On 5 April 1973, the concept of a multi-campus business school was created, with consecutive inaugurations of campuses taking place in the United Kingdom (London in 1974, move to Oxford in 1975) and in Germany (Düsseldorf in 1975, move to Berlin in 1985). In 1974 the ESCP developed courses in entrepreneurship in response to internal and external forces. Since then, the school has deepened its European presence to become an integrated pan-European business school:. In 2018, ESCP became an &quot;École consulaire&quot;, largely financed by the public Chambers of Commerce in Paris, Berlin, and Turin.

* In 1985, the School&#x27;s campus in Germany moved from Düsseldorf to Berlin at the invitation of the Government of Berlin.
* In 1988, a fourth campus was opened in Madrid.
* In 1999, ESCP merged with its sister school EAP.
* In 2001, the Master in Management programme taught at ESCP became validated by City University London.
* In 2004, a fifth campus in Turin was founded, whose courses became validated by the University of Turin; Master in Management students can obtain the Italian degree of Laurea Magistrale.
* In 2005, ESCP inaugurated its London campus, having moved from Oxford.
* In 2007, the Master in Management programme was recognised by the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; students can obtain the Spanish degree of Master Europeo en Administración y Dirección de Empresas.
* In 2015, ESCP established its sixth European campus with its partner Kozminski University in Poland. 
* In 2016, the School decides to strengthen its footprint in Paris by adding a second campus located in the Montparnasse area after buying back Novancia Business School&#x27;s building. The campus is dedicated to executive programs.
*In 2019, the School removed &quot;Europe&quot; from its name, reverting to its original name.

== &quot;Grande école&quot; degrees ==

ESCP Business School is a &quot;grande école&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League universities in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and the C9 League in China, graduation from a &quot;grande école&quot; is viewed as the ideal prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in the nation.

The degrees are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the French Ministry of National Education. Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the &quot;Licence&quot;, or Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and the Master&#x27;s and Doctoral degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various &quot;parcours&quot; or paths based on UE (&quot;Unités d&#x27;enseignement&quot; or &quot;Modules&quot;), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Bachelors is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (&quot;Programme Grande École&quot;) ends with the degree of Master in Management (MiM).

==Rankings==


==Campus==
ESCP students can study on campuses in France (Paris), the UK (London), Spain (Madrid), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Turin), and Poland (Warsaw). They can spend either 6 months or 1 year on each campus according to their study choices. Each campus has its own specifics and develops programs with local academic institutions. For instance, in Spain, ESCP provides a Master in Business Project Management co-delivered with the Technical University of Madrid and in Italy, a double-degree program is available for engineers together with the Polytechnic University of Turin.

Since 2017, ESCP has had two campuses in Paris, one near the Place de la République (in the 11th arrondissement of Paris) and another one near the Montparnasse Tower (in the 15th arrondissement of Paris). Each campus is dedicated to a specific range of programs. The campus in the 11th arrondissement hosts all the graduate programs whereas the campus in the 15th arrondissement hosts the undergraduate education, the executive education and the school&#x27;s start-up Incubator, the Blue Factory. This organization is unique to Paris; on every other campus, undergraduate, graduate and executive programmes are dispensed in the same campus.

<text>Michael Strunge Jensen (19 June 1958 – 9 March 1986) was a Danish poet. He is regarded as perhaps the most influential Danish postmodern poet, and his works are among the most studied poems in Denmark.

As a member of the original circle of 1980s poets in the group around Hvedekorn&#x27;s editor Poul Borum, Michael Strunge, in cooperation with his colleague Jens Fink-Jensen, among others, arranged the generational manifestation “NÅ!!80” in Copenhagen in 1980.

He received the Otto Gelsted Prize in 1983.

With influences from both Romanticism, Symbolism and Modernism, Strunge&#x27;s work is somewhat reminiscent of that of French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Strunge&#x27;s poetry deals with such topics as sex, death, modernity and life in the city.

Originally inspired by the British punk wave of the late 1970s, many of Strunge&#x27;s poems are full of references to the artists of his day, such as The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Cure, Joy Division, New Order, Brian Eno and David Bowie.

Strunge caused his own death on 9 March 1986, during a manic episode caused by bipolar disorder, by jumping from the 4th floor. His last words before jumping were &quot;Now I can fly&quot;, indicating that he did not mean to kill himself. The quote is printed on a memorial plaque placed on the facade of the building he jumped from. He is buried at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen.

<doc id="543792" wikidata="Q495936" url="?curid=543792" title="Caronia">
<text>Caronia (Sicilian: Carunìa, Greek: (Ptol.) or (Diod. et al.), Latin: Calacte or Cale Acte) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; on the north coast of Sicily, in the province of Messina, about halfway between Tyndaris (modern Tindari) and Cephaloedium (modern Cefalù). The town has 3,555 inhabitants.

==History==
Kale Akte (or Caleacte, Calacta, Calacte) derived its name from the beauty of the neighboring country; the whole of this strip of coast between the &quot;Montes Heraei&quot; and the sea being called by the Greek settlers of Magna Graecia from an early period, the Fair Shore ( – &quot;he Kale Akte&quot;). Its beauty and fertility had attracted the particular attention of the Zanclaeans, who in consequence invited the Samians and Milesians (after the capture of Miletus by the Persians, 494 BC) to establish themselves on this part of the Sicilian coast. Events, however, turned their attention elsewhere, and they ended with occupying Zancle itself. At a later period the project was resumed by the Sikel leader Ducetius, who, after his expulsion from Sicily by Syracuse and his exile at Corinth, returned at the head of a body of colonists from the Peloponnese; and having obtained much support from the neighbouring Siculi, especially from Archonides, dynast of Herbita, according to Diodorus Siculus founded a city on the coast, which was called Kalè Akté (The Fair Shore or Beautiful Coast). The date given by Diodorus is 446 BC, but in another passus the same author says that Ducetius colonised Kale Akte in 440 BC, the same year he died. In addition, recent excavations at Caronia, which is clearly the site of the Hellenistic and Roman town Kale Akte, have revealed only very sparse remains from the 5th century BC, and show that a Sikel settlement already existed here in the early 5th century BC. It is possible that Ducetius founded the colony on the site of this already existing Sikel settlement, just as he had done at Menai and Paliké.

Some scholars have hypothesised that Ducetius returned without the consent of Syracuse, but this is very improbable. He must have had the permission of Syracuse to end the exile at Corinth (the mother city of Syracuse), and he brought according to Diodorus partly Corinthian settlers for the colonising project at Kale Akte. Syracuse would have had an interest of establishing an allied Sikel-Greek colony on the north coast, without risking too much in a potentially hostile Sikel-dominated area.

There are little subsequent account of its fortunes. It appears to have been in Cicero&#x27;s time a considerable municipal town. Silius Italicus speaks of it as abounding in fish, &quot;litus piscosa Calacte&quot; and its name, though omitted by Pliny, is found in Ptolemy, as well as in the Antonine Itineraries; but there is considerable difficulty in regard to its position. The distances given in the Tabula Peutingeriana, however (12 M. P. from Alaesa, and 30 M. P. from Cephaloedium), coincide with the site of the modern town of Caronia, on the shore below which Fazello tells us that ruins and vestiges of an ancient city were still visible in his time. Cluverius, who visited Caronia, speaks with admiration of the beauty and pleasantness of this part of the coast, &quot;littoris excellens amoenitas et pulchritudo,&quot; which rendered it fully worthy of its ancient name.

The Greek rhetorician Caecilius of Caleacte, who flourished in the time of Augustus, was a native of Caleacte, whence he derived the surname of Calactinus.

In 2004–2005 and 2014 two series of unusual fires were reported in the village of Canneto, west of Messina. Official investigations suggested that all of these fires were cases of arson and arrests were made in 2015. However, persistent speculation has ascribed the fires to other natural and supernatural causes. From January to August 2004, appliances, including a television, a cooker and vacuum cleaner, were reported to have caught fire spontaneously. Fires also reportedly struck wedding presents and a piece of furniture. At least one person was said to have observed an unplugged electrical cable ignite spontaneously. the outbreaks reportedly continued after ENEL, the Italian power utility, cut off the town&#x27;s power supply. In 2008 investigators concluded that the 2004–2005 fires were caused by arson. Mysterious fires again occurred in mid-2014. On March 5, 2015 police arrested and charged Giuseppe Pezzino, 26, with arson, conspiracy to commit fraud, and sounding a false alarm in association with the mysterious fires. His father, Antonino Pezzino, has also been implicated. The Italian military police had installed hidden cameras in the streets after the fires started again (July 2014). Video captured about 40 incidents implicating Giuseppe (and occasionally, Antonino). Further evidence was gathered by phone taps. 

==Climate==
The climate is Hot Summer Mediterranean. The station’s elevation is 302 meters above sea level.

<text>Surrey Hills is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 11 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Boroondara and Whitehorse local government areas. Surrey Hills recorded a population of 13,655 at the .

Surrey Hills was settled in the late 19th century and evolved with slightly smaller blocks and slightly simpler housing than its neighbour Canterbury. Most of Surrey Hills&#x27; streets are lined with now-mature European trees, mostly plane and pin oak.

It is bordered by Elgar Road in the east, Riversdale Road in the south, Highfield Road in the west and Whitehorse Road in the north.

==History==

The Surrey Hills area was acquired from the Crown by Henry Elgar, as part of his Special Survey purchase in 1841.

The Surrey Hills area was first developed by a Real Estate consortia, following the extension of the railway line from Camberwell to Lilydale in 1882. Surrey Hills Post Office opened on 1 October 1884. Housing estates were laid out and lovely period homes built in either brick or weatherboard, with most designs being influenced by the Victorian, Federation and Edwardian era. The streets were planted mainly with avenues of Pin Oak and Plane trees, which are now mature and offer a pleasant shady vista. The streets have impressive names such as Empress, Kingston, Surrey, Balmoral, Leopold, Windsor, Albert and Wolseley, but the area was considered too distant from the nearest shopping districts: Camberwell to the west and Box Hill to the east. The economic depression of the 1890s brought development to a halt and the next major phase of suburban development didn&#x27;t take place until after the First World War.

During the 1990s, the last bank branch in the Union Road shopping strip closed, which caused some concern within both the local community and local traders. On 24 February 2003, the Surrey Hills Community Bank (a community bank branch of Bendigo Bank) opened for business in Union Road.

==Today==
Surrey Hills contains both the &#x27;English Counties District&#x27;, which is a small area between Canterbury and Riversdale Roads, where the streets are named after English Counties, including Norfolk, Durham, Kent, Middlesex, Essex and Suffolk Roads and the &#x27;Chatham Precinct&#x27;, which is located between Canterbury, Union, Mont Albert &amp; Chatham Roads. The latter streets are named after English places (Croydon, Guildford &amp; Surrey) and Sir Garnet Road, named in honour of a famous British Army General (Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley, born in Ireland, who served a distinguished career and became a hero in the British Army in the late 1800s &amp; early 1900).

The suburb has 3 local primary schools; Surrey Hills Primary, Chatham Primary School and Our Lady&#x27;s of Perpetual Succour. Surrey Hills&#x27; Central Business District is relatively small, consisting of a 300-metre strip of shops along Union Road.

The neighbourhood centre formerly featured Surrey Hills railway station (on the Belgrave and Lilydale railway lines). Heading out from Melbourne&#x27;s CBD, Union Road was the first railway level crossing on the Belgrave/Lilydale train line until 2023, when the line was lowered as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. As part of this work, Surrey Hills station was replaced by Union railway station, slightly further northeast and just into Mont Albert. Surrey Hills also has Chatham railway station, north of Canterbury Road, between Stanley Terrace and Junction Road. Chatham Station can be accessed from the north by laneways between houses, beginning near the Mont Albert Road General Store, then continuing south along the Canterbury Sports Ground pathway. Most working residents of Surrey Hills commute to Melbourne either by car or train. To reach a safe bicycle path for the city commute, cyclists must travel south to the Gardiners Creek Trail or north to the Yarra River Trail, via the Outer Circle Trail. A bike lane is located on Mont Albert Road.

To the north, Surrey Hills is also serviced by the route 109 tram, which continues from Port Melbourne, along Collins Street (Melb.CBD), along Whitehorse Rd, to Box Hill and in the south, the route 70 tram travels along Riversdale Road from the city to the Wattle Park terminus at the Elgar Road junction. Canterbury Road between Station Street, Box Hill and Union Road, Surrey Hills is the only east–west major road not served by any public transport, although historically the road was served by busses until the 1960s. There are a few remaining bus stop seats on Canterbury Road, but the nearest operating public transport is via Riversdale Road to the South (trams), Mont Albert Station to the north (trains), Union Road (busses) and Surrey Hills station (trains) to the west. These points all represent around one mile in distance from the peak of Surrey Hills (at around the position of the large telecommunication towers on the corner of Canterbury Road and Harding Street).

==Parks and gardens==

The major parks and gardens in Surrey Hills are Surrey Gardens and South Surrey Park. Surrey Hills is also adjacent to Wattle Park, which is just across Riversdale Road to the south, in Burwood.

==Sport==

Canterbury Sports Ground is located in the north-west of the suburb and has 3 sporting clubs. It is the home ground of the Australian Rules Football club, Canterbury &#x27;Cobras&#x27;, who currently compete in the Eastern Football League, as well as the Canterbury Cricket Club, which plays on a turf wicket and Canterbury Tennis Club, which has its own clubhouse and 4 en-tou-cas courts.

<doc id="543799" wikidata="Q15020992" url="?curid=543799" title="Wise use movement">
<text>The wise use movement in the United States is a coalition of groups promoting the expansion of private property rights and reduction of government regulation of publicly held property. This includes advocacy of expanded use by commercial and public interests, seeking increased access to public lands, and often opposition to government intervention. Wise use proponents describe human use of the environment as &quot;stewardship of the land, the water and the air&quot; for the benefit of human beings. The wise use movement arose from opposition to the mainstream environmental movement, claiming it to be radical.

==Background to the movement==
A range of groups belong to the wise use movement, including industry, grassroots organizations of loggers, mill workers, ranchers, farmers, miners, off-road vehicle users, and property owners. It also includes libertarians, populists, and religious and political conservatives. The movement became known as &quot;wise use&quot; after the 1988 Multiple Use Strategy Conference in Reno, Nevada. The movement includes or is supported by multiple anti-environmentalist groups, by companies in the resource extraction industry, by land development companies, and by libertarian and minarchist organizations. The movement was most active in the Western United States in the late 1980s and 1990s.

===Major organizations===
According to James McCarthy (2002), the most prominent wise use groups receive most of their support from resource extraction industries (Amoco, British Petroleum, Chevron, Exxon/Mobile, Marathon Oil) as well as the 
American Farm Bureau, Dupont, Yamaha, General Electric, General Motors, National Cattlemen&#x27;s Association, and the National Rifle Association). The policies and political orientations of groups in the wise use movement range from some who self-identify as free-market environmentalists, to industry-backed public relations groups and mainstream think tanks, to some militia groups and fundamentalist religious groups. Major organizations promoting wise use ideas include Alliance for America, the American Land Rights Association, the Cato Institute, the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, People for the West, the Blue Ribbon Coalition, and the Heartland Institute.

Most members of the wise use movement, including the related County Movement, share a belief in individual rights, as opposed to the authority of the federal government, in particular with regard to the rights of land use. They argue that the environmental movement is both anti-private property and anti-people. While some in the wise use movement have strongly anti-environmental views, others assert that the free market, rather than government regulation, will better protect the environment.

====Wise use agenda====
Many wise use groups argue that rural residents suffer a disproportionate impact from environmental regulations, and that the environmental movement is biased toward the attitudes of urban elites, ignoring the rural perspective. Opponents observe that the extractive forces behind the wise use movement harm rural residents more and prey on the independence of rural residents - preaching the &quot;right to ride&quot; when behind that is the desire to strip mine and clearcut using unsustainable methods. Some environmentalists disagree with the Sierra Club&#x27;s &quot;no-cut forest&quot; policy. Steve Thompson wrote the goal of the policy should be to &quot;provide greater flexibility to achieve true forest restoration. A blanket, one-size-fits-all &#x27;zero cut&#x27; policy severely restricts the Sierra Club&#x27;s ability to provide solutions to complex forest mismanagement problems.&quot;
====Wise use strategies====
Wise use groups depict themselves as (and seek to promote themselves as) true environmentalists with close ties to the land, and cast environmental groups as advocating radical environmentalism. Wise use groups also downplay threats to the environment, and highlight uncertainties in environmental science that they argue environmental groups ignore or conceal. Wise use groups also portray the environmentalist movement as having a hidden agenda to control land.

==Ron Arnold and wise use==
The Wise Use movement first gained prominence in 1988 when Ron Arnold, a vice-president of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, helped an organize conference that led to adoption of a 25-point &quot;Wise Use Agenda&quot;. This agenda included initiatives seeking unrestricted commercial use of public lands for timber, mining, and oil, and to open recreational wilderness areas for easier access by the general public. Critics point out that Ron Arnold has been quoted as saying his goal is to &quot;destroy the environmental movement&quot;.

According to Arnold, many in the wise use movement believe the possibility of unlimited economic growth, in which environmental and social problems can be mitigated by market economy and the use of technology. In his book &quot;Ecology Wars&quot;, which has been called the &quot;Bible&quot; of the wise use movement, Arnold writes: &quot;Environmentalism is an institutionalized movement of certain people with a certain ideology about man and nature&quot; and that &quot;the goal of our ecology wars should be to defeat environmentalism.&quot; Arnold claims that environmentalism is &quot;the excess baggage of anti-technology, of anti-civilization, of anti-humanity, and of institutionalized lust for political power.&quot;

===Access to public lands===

In the 1980s and 1990s, the management focus on public lands shifted from the harvest of timber to ecological goals such as improvement of habitat, largely as a response to the environmental movement. The resultant reduction in timber harvest contributed to the closure of sawmills and the layoff of loggers and other workers. Some members of the wise use movement objected to what they saw as a shifting of control of federal land resources from local to outside, urban interests. They argued that the National Forests were established for the benefit of the local community. They cite Gifford Pinchot, who wrote &quot;It is the duty of the Forest Service to see to it that the timber, water-powers, mines, and every other resource of the forests is used for the benefit of the people who live in the neighborhood or who may have a share in the welfare of each locality.&quot; Wise use members have also argued that continued access to public lands is necessary to maintain the health, culture and traditions of local communities.

Jill M. Belsky, a professor of Rural &amp; Environmental Sociology at the University of Montana, wrote:
:&quot;there is a pattern for rural peoples and communities to be viewed as destroyers of nature in the United States, given their reliance on extractive industries such as mining, logging, grazing and commercial, petrochemical based-farming; and they provided political action in support of these industries. Given this history, it is not surprising that there has been a reluctance on the part of conservationists to envision how rural peoples and rural livelihoods could have played any significant role in the formation of wildlands or in any potential role they could play in the restoration and protection of large wildlands in the future. In the United States policy emphasizes ecosystems and ecosystem management. But while I understand this logic, I think it underestimates the importance of rural places, peoples and livelihoods in the management of large wildlands.&quot;

==Criticism==
Academics Ralph Maughan and Douglas Nilsona write that wise use is a &quot;desperate effort to defend the hegemony of the cultural and economic values of the agricultural and extractive industries of the rural West&quot;, and have &quot;argued that the Wise Use agenda stemmed from an ideology that combined &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism with cultural characteristics of an imagined Old West&quot;.

Some critics of the wise use movement claim that the strong rhetoric used has deepened divisions between opposing interest groups, and has indirectly increased violence and threats of violence against environmental groups and public employees. &quot;Many observers noted that Wise Use activity in some areas overlapped heavily with the 1990s formation and growth of militias, self-styled volunteer paramilitary organizations presciently committed to their own version of homeland security.&quot;

Environmental historian Richard White has criticized Wise Use for upholding the rights of large landowners at the expense of working rural people in his essay, &quot;&#x27;Are You an Environmentalist or Do You Work for a Living?&#x27;: Work and Nature.&quot;

Broadcast journalist Stephenie Hendricks claimed in her book &quot;Divine Destruction&quot; that wise use is in part &quot;being driven by biblical fundamentalists who believe exhausting natural resources will hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.&quot;

===Grassroots or front groups===

Environmental activists have argued that the wise use movement is orchestrated largely or entirely by industry. David Helvarg&#x27;s book &quot;The War Against the Greens&quot; contends that the wise use movement is not a collection of grassroots uprisings, but a set of astroturfing movements created by big business. Carl Deal, author of &quot;The Greenpeace Guide to Anti-Environmental Organizations&quot; also makes the same claim: that wise use groups give the appearance of being popular grassroots movements, but are actually front organizations for industry groups with a financial interest in the movement&#x27;s agenda. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. also described this conspiracy against the environment by wise use organizations in his 2004 book &quot;Crimes Against Nature.&quot;

These critics have largely portrayed so-called &quot;grassroots&quot; groups as being front groups and rural Westerners as serving as dupes for extractive industries and their interests. However, while corporate power played an important role in the wise use movement, the relationship between rural westerners and extractive industries was not a result of individual citizens blindly accepting corporate narratives; instead, wise use was an alliance between groups with similar goals regarding private property rights and access to public lands. Corporations also were better able to connect with rural residents because, according to James McCarthy, &quot;[c]orporations were in fact often more sensitive to the region&#x27;s cultural politics than many environmentalists and so were better able to engage culture for instrumental purposes.&quot;

==History==
The term wise use was coined in 1910 by U.S. Forest Service leader Gifford Pinchot to describe his concept of sustainable harvest of natural resources.

Today&#x27;s wise use coalition has appropriated a nineteenth-century term. According to historian Douglas McCleery, the idea of &quot;conservation as wise use&quot; of natural resources began with conservation leader Gifford Pinchot in the late nineteenth century. The original &quot;wise use&quot; movement was a product of the Progressive Era, and included the concept of multiple use—public land can be used simultaneously for recreation, for timber, for mining, and for wildlife habitat. The multiple-use and wise use concepts advocated by Pinchot reflected the view that nature&#x27;s resources should be scientifically managed so as &quot;to protect the basic productivity of the land and its ability to serve future generations.&quot;

The modern use of the term &quot;wise use&quot; to refer to opposition to the environmental movement dates to the publication of Ron Arnold&#x27;s book &quot;Wise Use Agenda&quot; in 1989. The wise use movement has it roots in both the earlier &quot;Sagebrush Rebellion&quot; in the western United States during the late 1970s and to the earlier opposition to the formation of the national forests.

However, unlike the Sagebrush Rebellion, which consisted largely of the formation of industry public relations groups by resource extraction industries and corporations such as Coors and Co, wise use included grassroots groups. Ron Arnold argued that the inclusion of citizen groups would make the movement more effective. In 1979, in &quot;Logging Management&quot; magazine, Arnold wrote: &quot;Citizen activist groups, allied to the forest industry, are vital to our future survival. They can speak for us in the public interest where we ourselves cannot. They are not limited by liability, contract law or ethical codes... industry must come to support citizen activist groups, providing funds, materials, transportation, and most of all, hard facts.&quot;

James McCarthy wrote:
The Wise Use movement is a broad coalition of over a thousand national, state, and local groups. Its existence by this name dates from a 1988 &#x27;Multiple-Use Strategy Conference&#x27; attended by nearly 200 organizations, mainly Western-based, including natural resource industry corporations and trade associations, law firms specializing in combating environmental regulations, and recreational groups. The conference produced a legislative agenda intended to &#x27;destroy environmentalism&#x27; and promote the &#x27;wise use&#x27; of natural resources - an intentionally ambiguous phrase strategically appropriated from the early conservation movement.

<text>Harald Zwart (born 1 July 1965) is a Dutch-Norwegian film director.

==Life and career==
Although born in the Netherlands, Zwart was raised in Fredrikstad, Norway. By age eight, he had started making short films. He attended the Dutch Film Academy in Amsterdam where he received great acclaim for his student film &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Surprise&quot;. The film was later televised.

<text>Sir Frederick Albert Millichip (5 August 1914 – 18 December 2002) was an English association footballer best known for his sometimes controversial contributions to the administration of the game.

== Biography ==
Raised in the West Midlands and educated at Solihull School in Solihull, Millichip played as a centre back for the third team of West Bromwich Albion in the years before World War II. During the war, he served in North Africa, Canada, Sicily and Italy, rising from an enlisted man to the rank of captain.

On demobilisation in 1945, he returned to his solicitor&#x27;s practice and became a director of West Bromwich Albion. He took on the role of chairman in 1974, when the club was failing to make progress in the Second Division under manager Don Howe. Under Millichip&#x27;s chairmanship, the club re-established itself in the First Division and recruited manager Ron Atkinson, building a team that was among the most exciting in English football &quot;circa&quot; 1980.

In 1981, Millichip was elected chairman of The Football Association and held the position during a period in which the English game suffered a succession of crises including the Heysel Stadium disaster, the Bradford City stadium fire and the Hillsborough disaster. His vacillation over the appointment of Terry Venables as manager of the national team, when the latter was under investigation and criticism for his business dealings, led journalist Brian Glanville to dub him &quot;Bert the inert&quot;.

He retired from the FA in 1996. In 1998, he was awarded a FIFA Order of Merit award.

==Personal life==

On 24 February 1943 Millichip married Patricia Mary Long, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Arthur Long, a company director. The marriage was short-lived, and he later omitted it from his Who&#x27;s Who entry.

On 27 December 1950 he married (Joan) Barbara Brown, a 24-year-old nursing sister. They had a son and a daughter. His son, Peter Millichip, who also followed his father into law, was also an ardent fan of West Bromwich Albion. He was a close friend of Sir Bobby Robson, and as Robson entered his final years, they worked together to establish the Sir Bobby Robson Football Academy, in Birmingham.

==Death==

Bert Millichip died suddenly on 18 December 2002 at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, following a heart attack which struck while he was attending an annual dinner at Edgbaston golf club. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their two children.

<text>Showtune is a musical revue celebrating the words and music of Broadway composer and lyricist Jerry Herman. Its title was inspired by Herman&#x27;s autobiography of the same name. The revue&#x27;s original title was &quot;Tune the Grand Up&quot;. After its 1985 San Francisco premiere and several regional productions through the 1990s, the piece played in the West End in 1998 under the title &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, and Off-Broadway in 2003, titled &quot;Showtune&quot;.

The forty songs featured in &quot;Showtune&quot; come from Herman&#x27;s Broadway musicals &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; (1961), &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1964), &quot;Mame&quot; (1966), &quot;Dear World&quot; (1969), &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; (1974), &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; (1979), &quot;A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine&quot; (1980), and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1983).

Conceived by Paul Gilger, the revue has no dialogue. Its songs are grouped into thematic scenes that tell stories and place a strong emphasis on Herman&#x27;s lyrics and their optimistic messages. The song-cycle format creates dramatic sub-texts giving through-lines to the show.

==Synopsis==
Act I

Herman&#x27;s optimistic view of show business life is presented in &quot;It&#x27;s Today!&quot;, the opening number from &quot;Mame&quot;, and &quot;Big Time&quot;, from &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;We Need A Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;Put On Your Sunday Clothes!&quot; present his strategies for dealing with bad news and hard times. In the latter number, the cast simulates a train, with the men&#x27;s bowler hats becoming smokestacks and the ladies&#x27; parasols acting as the wheels. Backstage at a Cabaret, an actor makes up as &quot;Zaza&quot; the star of &quot;La Cage Aux Folles!&quot; (&quot;A Little More Mascara&quot;). A crescent moon descends, and Zaza performs &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;. The cast sings &quot;I Am What I Am.&quot;

&quot;The Four Seasons&quot; is the theme for Herman&#x27;s outlook on love. Spring is represented by &quot;I Won&#x27;t Send Roses&quot;, &quot;Ribbons Down My Back&quot; and &quot;Dancing&quot;; summer is a battle of the sexes, with &quot;It Takes A Woman&quot; (men) &quot;Wherever He Ain&#x27;t!&quot; (women), &quot;Hundreds of Girls&quot; (men) and &quot;So Long, Dearie&quot; (women); and autumn includes &quot;And I Was Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Kiss Her Now&quot; (While She&#x27;s Young), with the two songs then given in counterpoint. During these numbers, the warring couples reconcile. Finally, in winter, the sequence is philosophical: Although &quot;Time Heals Everything&quot;, one must act &quot;Before the Parade Passes By!&quot;, and &quot;One Person&quot; can change the world, if he or she will &quot;Open a New Window&quot;.

Act II

As he thinks about the days of silent film, Mack Sennett recalls when &quot;Movies Were Movies&quot;, and his love story is seen through the eyes of a cameraman who sings &quot;Look What Happened to Mabel&quot;. Mabel dances a Charleston to &quot;That&#x27;s How Young I Feel&quot;. Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy perform &quot;My Best Girl&quot; on set for the umpteenth time, and she complains about his acting (&quot;Nelson&quot;). The company advises us to &quot;Just Go to the Movies&quot;. A woman&#x27;s unrequited love (&quot;It Only Takes a Moment&quot;), segues to a very pregnant Agnes Gooch who enters singing, &quot;It only took a moment&quot; and then her big number &quot;Gooch&#x27;s Song&quot;. A tap dancer encourages her to &quot;Tap Your Troubles Away&quot;. Big production numbers for leading ladies follow: &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;Mame&quot;. The two divas sing &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;.

A serious and romantic segment follows, with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot;, &quot;Song on the Sand&quot;, &quot;Shalom&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;If He Walked Into My Life&quot; and &quot;I Promise You a Happy Ending&quot;. These tender recollections yield to a big finale with a medley of production numbers &quot;Mame&quot;, &quot;The Best of Times&quot; and a reprise of &quot;It&#x27;s Today&quot;. The cast takes its bows singing &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and asks the audience to join in.

==Production history==
===San Francisco premiere===
&quot;Showtune&quot; was originally titled &quot;Tune the Grand Up&quot;, and premiered May 1, 1985 at The 1177 Club in the Gramercy Towers on Nob Hill in San Francisco. The cabaret-style show was directed by Paul Gilger and Barbara Valente, with choreography by Valente. The show ran for 2 years. The cast was:
*John Nockels (Man 1)
*Darlene Popovic (Woman 1)
*James Followell (Man 2 and the pianist)
*Alma Sayles (Woman 2)
*David Broussal (Man 3)
*Lise-Marie Thomas (Woman 3)
Cindy Herron joined the cast in the second year as Woman 3.

===California and Hawaii===
In March 1987, a production of &quot;Tune the Grand Up&quot; opened at the Lyceum Space Theatre in San Diego, California. The show was directed and choreographed by Barbara Valente, with the cast that included Cindy Herron, John Nockels, Tim Connell, Mimi Unser, Darlene Popovic and James Followell. In September 1987, a third production of &quot;Tune the Grand Up&quot; was financed by actor Richard Smart at the 490 seat Kahilu Theatre in the town of Kamuela, Hawaii. The production was directed and supervised by Gilger. The cast again starred Nockels and Herron, who were joined by A.J. Holmes.

In 1996, producer Jennifer Strome optioned the rights to &quot;Tune the Grand Up&quot; and produced the subsequent productions of the revue from the 1996 production in the Delta King Riverboat Theatre in Sacramento, California, until the 2003 Off-Broadway production. The Sacramento cast included Nockels and Barry Lloyd.

In November 1996, &quot;Tune the Grand Up&quot; returned to San Francisco at the Alcazar Theatre. The production was supervised by Jerry Herman, directed by Jay Manley and choreographed by Barbara Valente, with musical direction by Barry Lloyd. The cast was Pierce Brandt, Dan Johnson, Michelle E. Jordan, Barry Lloyd, Marsha Mercant and Jan Wasser. Every member of the cast won a Hollywood Drama-Logue Award.

===Off-West End===
In 1998, the revue was produced twice in London, by Strome in association with Sharleen Cooper Cohen, with a new title, &quot;The Best of Times&quot;. It was directed and choreographed by Bill Starr. It was produced at the Bridewell Theatre, with the cast that featured Lindsay Hamilton, and Karen Evans.

===West End===
The Bridewell production transferred, in November 1998, to the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End. The cast was Garth Bardsley, Kathryn Evans, James Followell (pianist), Sarah Payne, Jamie Golding and Lindsay Hamilton.

===New York tryout and Off-Broadway===
In October 2002, the revue, now retitled &quot;Showtune&quot;, had an out-of-town tryout at the Helen Hayes Theatre in Nyack, New York.

The Off-Broadway production was also directed and choreographed by McKneely, with music direction by Followell and the same cast as the tryout, except that Karen Murphy replaced McKechnie.

===Subsequent regional productions===
In June 2003, &quot;Showtune&quot; played at the Pasadena Playhouse in Los Angeles. The production was directed by Bill Starr and Sheldon Epps, with choreography by Starr. The cast included Vidnovic, Peaco and Merle Dandridge.

In November 2003, the musical was presented at the Caldwell Theatre in Boca Raton, Florida. The production was directed by Michael Hall, with choreography by Barbara Flaten and musical direction by Bobby Peaco. The cast included Vidnovic and Peaco.

<text>The Type 14 &quot;Blackwood&quot; class were a ship class of minimal &quot;second-rate&quot; anti-submarine warfare frigates. Built for the Royal Navy during the 1950s at a time of increasing threat from the Soviet Union&#x27;s submarine fleet, they served until the late 1970s. Twelve ships of this class served with the Royal Navy and a further three were built for the Indian Navy.

==Design==
The Type 14 frigates were designed to be cheaper and smaller than the expensive Type 12 frigates. Although they lacked gun armament, their anti-submarine armament of two Limbo mortars, Mk 20 torpedoes and sonar fit equalled the larger Type 12, and as the crews of the Type 14 concentrated almost entirely on practising anti-submarine warfare, they were often the most effective frigates in anti-submarine exercises until the mid 1960s. The class were entirely specialised for the anti-submarine role and hence had little capability in any other, though they did perform fishery protection duties during the confrontations with Iceland over fishing rights.

In the late 1950s, during their time on patrols around Iceland to ensure that Iceland did not interfere with British fishermen&#x27;s attempts to fish, problems were found with the hulls of the Type 14s in such heavy waters, so that their hulls had to be strengthened to cope with these patrols. However, they proved to be good sea boats throughout the dispute, which continued into the mid-1970s. The low profile of the superstructure was a deliberate design feature to confuse enemy attackers. The Type 14 design was flawed by the lack of a gun, and also by general lack of space. After experience with these frigates, the Admiralty decided that quality was the top priority of all ships, even though it meant having a smaller fleet.

One of the ships, &quot;Exmouth&quot;, was later converted 1966–1968 to act as experimental trials vessel for gas turbine propulsion, becoming the first major warship of the Royal Navy to be entirely powered by gas turbines. In this configuration she was easily distinguishable from other members of the class due to her larger (non-cylindrical, streamlined) funnel and large air intakes sited immediately fore and aft of the funnel. The success of these trials led to the adoption of all-gas turbine propulsion as standard on subsequent Royal Navy warship designs (Type 21 &amp; 22 Frigates, Type 42 destroyers, &#x27;Invincible&#x27; class carriers).

==Service==
The Type 14s&#x27; limited size, at just , restricted them from operating past the 1970s as anti-submarine ships. Their small hull limited the extent of modifications and upgrades possible, preventing the Type 14s from being armed with more effective weapons, effectively rendering them obsolete. All were decommissioned in the 1970s. The last operational were the gas powered &quot;Exmouth&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Hardy&quot; which attended the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977 and deployed again from the standby squadron in 1978.

===In film===
The 1960 Norman Wisdom film &quot;The Bulldog Breed&quot; was made in Portland harbour with co-operation from the Royal Navy, and features several of the &quot;Blackwood&quot;-class frigates. An early scene shows a flotilla of Type 14s led by .
The 1958 British comedy &quot;Further Up The Creek&quot; features the fictional HMS &quot;Aristotle&quot;, a type 14 frigate.
HMS Pellew (F62) appeared in 1961 British monster movie &quot;Gorgo&quot;. HMS &quot;Dundas&quot; appeared in the Ava Gardner film &quot;The Little Hut&quot; in 1957.

<text>Frog legs () are consumed as food in some cuisines. In French cuisine, they are considered a national delicacy. Other parts of the world that eat frog legs include Singapore, Southern China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Northeast India, Korea, Northern Italy, the Alentejo region of Portugal, Spain, Albania, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Northwestern Greece, Odesa Oblast of Ukraine, South Africa, and the Southern regions of the United States.

As of 2014, the world&#x27;s largest exporter of edible frogs is Indonesia, followed by China and Turkey. In Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean, many frogs are still caught wild. Balıkesir, Adana, Edirne, and Hatay are the popular Turkish cities for edible wild frogs.

Frog legs are rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and potassium. They are often said to taste like chicken because of their mild flavor, with a texture most similar to chicken wings. The taste and texture of frog meat are approximately between chicken and fish. Frogs are raised commercially in certain countries, including Vietnam. Frog muscles do not resolve rigor mortis as quickly as muscles from warm-blooded animals (chicken, for example) do, so heat from cooking can cause fresh frog legs to twitch.

==In world cuisines==
===France===
Frog legs, or as it is known in France, are a traditional dish particularly found in the region of the Dombes (&quot;département&quot; of Ain). Eaten for over a thousand years, they have been part of the national diet of France. Roughly 4,000 tonnes of frog legs are consumed every year in France.

===China===
In culinary environment, frogs are known in Chinese as (, literally &#x27;field chicken&#x27;). Frog legs () are also eaten in China, but are generally restricted to Southern Chinese cuisine traditions such as Cantonese and Sichuan cuisine. Bullfrogs and pig frogs are farmed on a large scale in some areas of China, such as Sichuan.

In Chinese cuisine, frog legs are usually stir-fried and mixed with light spices, stewed, fried, or made into congee.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesian cuisine, frog-leg soup is known as &quot;swikee&quot; or , most probably brought by the Chinese community in Indonesia and popular in Chinese Indonesian cuisine. is mainly frog-leg soup with a strong taste of garlic, gingers, and fermented soya beans (&quot;tauco&quot;), accompanied by celery or parsley leaves. is a typical dish from Purwodadi Grobogan, in Central Java province. Frog legs are also fried in margarine and sweet soy sauce or tomato sauce, battered and deep fried, or grilled. Frog eggs are also served in banana leaves (). The dried and crispy fried frog skin is also consumed as &quot;krupuk&quot; crackers; the taste is similar to fried fish skin.

Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Most of the supply of frog legs in Western Europe originates from frog farms in Indonesia; however, there is concern that frog legs from Indonesia are poached from wild populations, which may endanger wild amphibians.

===Italy===

Frogs are a common food in the northern part of Italy, especially throughout Piemonte and Lombardy and within these two regions especially in the Vercelli area in Piemonte and in the Pavia and Lomellina areas in Lombardy. In these places, frogs are part of the ancient culinary tradition and a typical staple food. The consumption of frogs is mainly related to the availability of animals due to the rural activities and typical agriculture in these places.

The large presence of frogs is mainly due to the agriculture typical of these areas which have always been known for their rice. The large cultivation of rice means that there is a large presence of artificial water channels used to flood rice fields during the growing season, which makes a perfect habitat for frogs. During the growth period when fields stay flooded, and even more during the draining of the fields, farmers and others often gather to go frog hunting armed with nets. Some towns even organize collective hunting sessions and games.

Frogs have gained much culinary relevance in these areas, with many rural towns hosting food festivals called – centered on frogs – where frogs are prepared in various ways. They typically take place during the rice-harvesting periods. With frog consumption closely connected to rice production and being the native land of the Italian dish risotto, one of the most common dishes is frog risotto, . Other local frog dishes include them being dipped in egg batter, breadcrumbed and then fried, or in soups and stews.

===Slovenia===

Frog legs () are a popular dish in Slovenian cuisine, especially in areas of eastern Slovenia (Prekmurje and north-eastern Styria). They are also quite popular in the country&#x27;s capital, Ljubljana, and have been considered the &quot;basis of the traditional city cuisine of Ljubljana&quot;. Up to modern times, they have been traditionally considered Lenten food and were especially popular in spring. They are also a popular traditional dish in the Vipava Valley in western Slovenia and are served in numerous restaurants in the Slovenian Littoral.

===Croatia===
Frog legs are popular in some parts of Croatia, especially in the &quot;Gorski Kotar&quot; region in the northwest of the country. They are considered a specialty in the Lokve municipality, where they are served cooked, fried, or in a stew, sometimes with polenta on the side.

===Spain===
In the western part of Spain, Extremadura and Castilla y Leon, frog legs are served deep-fried. They are a delicacy among its citizens. Frog legs also have great culinary value on the sides of the Ebro.

===Albania===

In Albania, frog legs are regarded as a delicacy. Frogs are mostly collected from the wild.

===Greece===
In Greece, frog legs are particularly associated with the city of Ioannina and its adjacent lake Pamvotida.

===Mexico===
The capture of frog legs is usually carried out in states such as Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Zacatecas, and much of the Central Plateau of Mexico. It occurs almost year-round and the haunches are consumed fried, in soups, broths, or stews such as haunches in green sauce.

===Romania===
In Romania, edible frogs are known as (). The legs are eaten breaded and fried.

=== Ukraine ===
Fried frog legs are a specialty of the small city of Vylkove in Odesa Oblast, Ukraine, but they have also gained popularity in Odesa.

===United States===

Frog legs are eaten in parts of the Southern United States, particularly in the Deep South and Gulf states where French influence is more prominent, including South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The legs are almost always served battered and fried. The Fellsmere Frog Leg Festival in Florida celebrates the dish every January. They are also eaten in Eastern states, but not as commonly. Frog legs are a popular dish in Cleveland, Ohio, especially in its Little Italy and Asiatown neighborhoods. The most common kinds of frogs eaten are bullfrogs and leopard frogs, as these are abundant in most of the country, including the South. Although the consumption of wild native frogs is generally discouraged, the harvest and cooking of invasive bullfrogs, especially in the Western US, has been encouraged as a form of control and to promote local cuisine.

Some methods of cooking include egg-/cracker-crumb breading or battered. They are either fried or grilled. Deep-fried frog legs can also be found at fairs.

Raccoons, possums, partridges, prairie hens, and frogs were among the fare Mark Twain recorded as part of American cuisine.

===Caribbean===
Mountain chickens (&quot;Leptodactylus fallax&quot;) are frogs named for their habitat and flavor which are eaten in Montserrat and Dominica. The frogs are now critically endangered.

===United Kingdom===
Cooked bones of frog legs have been discovered in an archaeological dig in Amesbury Wiltshire, dating back to between 7596 and 6250 BC, evidence that indicates that they were part of the local diet. Some view this as evidence that Britons started eating them before the French. For several centuries, however, frogs have been considered repellent to the British due to their historic rivalry with the French. &quot;Frog&quot; has been an abusive English nickname for a French person since the late 18th century. In the late 19th century, the French restaurateur Auguste Escoffier tried to rename them &quot;nymphs&quot; in a vain attempt to sell them to London diners. In recent decades, adventurous British chefs have introduced frog leg dishes to their menus, notably Heston Blumenthal, whose recipes have included frog blancmange.

===Australia, New Zealand and Canada===

In Australia and New Zealand, frogs are more exotic, usually eaten at Asian or French restaurants and mainly the hind legs are the priority. In Canada, they are a little more common, mainly in eastern and northeastern Canada.

==Issues==

===Trade===

Each year about US$40 million worth of frog legs are traded internationally, with most countries in the world participating in this trade. The world&#x27;s top importers of frog legs are France, Belgium, and the United States, while the biggest international exporters are Indonesia and China. While these figures do not account for domestic consumption, when production from frog farms is taken into account, it is conservatively estimated that humans consume up to 3.2 billion frogs for food around the world every year.

===Health===
Movement of live or unfrozen, unskinned amphibians is a potential way for deadly amphibian diseases such as &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; and Ranavirus to be transported around the world, and despite recommendations on preventing disease spread from the World Organisation for Animal Health, which regulates the international spread of epizootic diseases, few countries have adopted these recommendations as law.

In Canada, the sale of fresh or frozen frog legs is illegal unless they are determined free from bacteria of the genus &quot;Salmonella,&quot; as per the official method MFO-10, Microbial Examination of Froglegs.

===Environment and animal welfare===

Many environmentalists urge the restriction of frog consumption—especially those harvested from the wild—because amphibian populations are declining and frogs are an essential element of ecosystems. Conservationists warn that gastronomic demand for frogs is seriously depleting regional populations. Frogs are sensitive to environmental changes, disease, habitat degradation, and pollution.

The exception to this is where the American bullfrog is not native and has been introduced. In these ecosystems, American bullfrogs can decimate local amphibian populations, upset ecosystem balance, and have negative impacts on other species of wildlife as well.

A 2011 paper raised animal welfare concerns over methods such as live removal of legs and methods of hunting, recommending that countries of origin &quot;establish humane standards to govern the capture, handling, packaging and export of live frogs and for the capture, handling, killing, and processing of frogs used for food to minimize animal suffering&quot;.

===Religious===
According to Jewish dietary laws, all reptiles and amphibians are considered unclean animals. Therefore, frog legs are not kosher, and are forbidden to observant Jews in Orthodox Judaism. However, more liberal streams of Judaism such as Reform do not prohibit the eating of non-kosher animals. Traditional Judaism also includes universal laws that define which activities are considered sinful even for non-Jews according to Jewish law, known as the Noahide laws. Under this rubric, there is a prohibition against eating limbs taken from live animals, known as ; thus, Jewish law would consider it to be sinful for any person to eat frogs legs that were removed from live frogs. This is also considered to be under the prohibition of cruelty to animals, which liberal Jewish streams accept as forbidden just as traditional Judaism considers to be forbidden.

Frog meat is considered as &quot;haraam&quot; (non-&quot;halal&quot;) according to some Islamic dietary laws. Those who consider it &quot;haraam&quot; cite the hadith that prohibits the killing of frogs, together with ants, bees, and seabirds. This &quot;haraam&quot; status has caused controversy in Demak, Indonesia, where the authorities urged the (frog leg soup) restaurant owners not to associate with Demak town, since it would tarnish Demak&#x27;s image as the first Islamic city/town in Java, and also opposed by its inhabitants that mainly follow the Shafi&#x27;i school, which forbids the consumption of frogs. The Islamic &quot;madhhab&quot; (school) of Shafi&#x27;i, Hanafi and Hanbali strictly forbids the consumption of frogs, but in the Maliki school, opinions vary between the consumption of all frogs being halal, to only the green frog commonly found in rice fields being halal, while other species, especially those with blistered skin, are considered to be unclean.

In medieval and early modern Europe, frogs were not classified as meat and could therefore be eaten during the Christian fast of Lent, along with fish and bird flesh. Monks in Lorraine were recorded as eating frogs during Lent in the 13th century. The famous French chef Grimod de La Reynière wrote in the early 19th century that frogs were known as (Lenten larks).

<text>A5/2 is a stream cipher used to provide voice privacy in the GSM cellular telephone protocol. It was designed in 1992-1993 (finished March 1993) as a replacement for the relatively stronger (but still weak) A5/1, to allow the GSM standard to be exported to countries &quot;with restrictions on the import of products with cryptographic security features&quot;.

The cipher is based on a combination of four linear-feedback shift registers with irregular clocking and a non-linear combiner.

In 1999, Ian Goldberg and David A. Wagner cryptanalyzed A5/2 in the same month it was reverse engineered, and showed that it was extremely weak – so much so that low end equipment can probably break it in real time.

In 2003, Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller presented a ciphertext-only attack based on the error correcting codes used in GSM communication. They also demonstrated a vulnerability in the GSM protocols that allows a man-in-the-middle attack to work whenever the mobile phone supports A5/2, regardless of whether it was actually being used.

Since July 1, 2006, the GSMA (GSM Association) mandated that GSM Mobile Phones will not support the A5/2 Cipher any longer, due to its weakness, and the fact that A5/1 is deemed mandatory by the 3GPP association. In July 2007, the 3GPP has approved a change request to prohibit the implementation of A5/2 in any new mobile phones, stating: &quot;It is mandatory for A5/1 and non encrypted mode to be implemented in mobile stations. It is prohibited to implement A5/2 in mobile stations.&quot; If the network does not support A5/1 then an unencrypted connection can be used.

<text>The M48 is a motorway in Great Britain, which crosses the Severn near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, linking England with Wales via the Severn Bridge. This road used to be the M4, and as a result is anomalously numbered: as it lies to the north of the M4 and to the west of the M5, it is in the Motorway Zone 5. The M4, M48 and the A48(M) motorway are the only motorways in Wales.

==Route==
Travelling from east to west, after leaving the M4 at Awkley, junction 21, near Olveston in England, the M48 begins by heading north-west towards Aust, junction 1. It crosses the Severn and Wye rivers via the Severn Bridge. Entering Wales, the M48 heads south-west after junction 2, passing to the south of Chepstow, past Crick and continuing in a south-westerly direction, passing Caldicot and Rogiet. The motorway rejoins the M4 at Undy, junction 23 to the east of Magor.

Junction 2 can be reached via the A466, which leads to the A48. The junction gives access to the Wye Valley, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. When travelling either east or west on the M4, the M48 is the more direct route for Chepstow and Caldicot.

==History==
The M48 was opened as part of the M4 in 1966.
Before this date traffic between South West England and South Wales was either transported on a motorail service through the Severn Tunnel, used the Aust Ferry (which was unsuitable for large goods vehicles) or travelled through Gloucester to pass north of the Severn Estuary. The route became increasingly busy and in 1984 a report was commissioned. After four years of construction, the Second Severn Crossing was opened in 1996 and was designated M4. The original stretch of motorway was designated M48 and continues to link England and Wales. Since 17 December 2018, both crossings have been toll-free.

In October 2021, the Welsh Government announced it was considering the possibility of reclassifying the M48 into an A-road. The government stated this is due to a large decrease in traffic following the opening of the Second Severn Crossing. The government plans to improve connectivity between local roads and the M48 in Wales but state that building new junctions to a Motorway-standard would be too costly considering the lower amount of traffic the M48 now handles. Reclassification of the motorway requires approval of both the Welsh Government and Secretary of State for Wales, with the Department for Transport stating they have no plans to reclassify the road.

==Services==
Severn View services are at junction 1, formerly called Aust Services when originally opened, and may also be accessed via the A403 from Avonmouth. There is a footpath leading from the services to allow pedestrians to cross the bridge. When the M4 was diverted over the Second Severn Crossing, it was anticipated that these services may close. The original building offered views of the River Severn. It was sold and operations continue in a new, smaller development on an adjacent site nearer the motorway junction.

<text>The M49 is a motorway in England that links the M4 (J22) with the M5 (J18A). The southern end is on the outskirts of Avonmouth and the northern end is immediately to the east of the Prince of Wales Bridge which was constructed at the same time 1996. It is long and unique in that it is only accessible from other motorways.

==Route==
The M49 begins at junction 18A of the M5 and then heads roughly north and northwest before it reaches its terminal junction with the M4 at junction 22, just before the Second Severn Crossing at Pilning Interchange. It cuts journey times for traffic to and from Avonmouth docks, Central and southern Bristol and South West England.

Compared to driving via the M4/M5 interchange, using the M49 cuts the distance travelled by 6.2 miles. Having a two-way grade separated roundabout junction with the M4, it also fulfils the additional role of providing a bypass for the busy stretch of the M5 between the Avonmouth Bridge and the M4 in case of that route being shut.

Original plans provided for an intermediate junction with the A403, to serve an expanded industrial area and Severn Beach. Construction of Junction 1 commenced summer 2018 and was completed late in August 2020. Despite this, the junction is not currently connected to the local road network, so cannot be used to access the motorway.

The M49 is anomalously numbered, as it is entirely to the south of the M4 and should therefore begin with a 3.

== Junction 1 link road dispute ==
After the junction itself was completed in August 2020, disputes arose over who should construct the road linking the new Junction 1 to the local road network. The dispute initially emerged between Highways England, South Gloucestershire Council, and the development company Delta Properties, as a result of privately owned land on the development which surrounds the junction.

In February 2021, the West of England Combined Authority agreed to supply £1million towards the construction of the link road, but by May a further deficit of £1million had arisen. Land required to complete the junction was in parcels as small as two square metres, which a South Gloucestershire councillor called &quot;ransom strips&quot; to increase the land price. In February 2023, the council authorised compulsory purchase orders for the land purchase, with National Highways providing an additional £7million for the council to buy the land.

<doc id="543826" wikidata="Q5546819" url="?curid=543826" title="Georges Hall">
<text>Georges Hall, a suburb of local government area City of Canterbury-Bankstown, is located 24 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district in the state of New South Wales, Australia, and is part of the South-western Sydney region.

Georges Hall is bounded by the Georges River in the west and Bankstown Aerodrome in the south. The suburbs of Bass Hill and Condell Park lie to the north and east, respectively.

==History==
This suburb was originally part of Bankstown and Bankstown Airport (its nearest neighbour).

In 1795, George Bass, Matthew Flinders and the boy servant William Martin began an expedition to explore parts of the colony on a small boat called the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;. They sailed into Botany Bay and explored the Georges River, twenty miles (32 km) beyond previous expeditions to the area that is now Garrison Point.

For their exploration efforts Bass was given a grant by Governor John Hunter (in the area of present day Hazel Street and Flinders Road, alongside Prospect Creek) in 1798, neighbouring suburb Bass Hill honours his name. This grant later reverted to the Crown. Bass&#x27;s fellow explorer, Mathew Flinders, received a grant south of Bass&#x27;s (bounded by present day Marion St, Bellevue Ave, Flinders Rd and Prospect Creek). He bought more land until he had , but he did not farm it.

Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston, built his first home, a farmhouse, in this area, on a grant of in 1798. It was situated on Prospect Creek, near the present day Henry Lawson Drive and Beatty Parade, he called it &#x27;Georges Hall&#x27;. His third son, David became a grazier on this property (which was a farming area in its early days), and the suburb takes its name from the Johnston farm.

David Johnston was later appointed by Governor Lachlan Macquarie as superintendent of herds and stock for the colony. His older brother, George Jr. had held this position until his death in 1820 following a riding accident on the Macarthur property at Camden Park. In 1809 the farmhouse of George&#x27;s Hall was used as an administration centre, where it was used to conduct the census. Garrison Point obtained its name from the garrison of soldiers that were stationed here to ensure the safety of Lt Colonel Johnston as he conducted a census in the area. The park is now the local focus of annual Australia Day celebrations in the Bankstown area.

In 1837 another home was built by the Johnston family, this time it was on higher ground in Bankstown (in present Lionel Street), and well away from the danger of Georges River floods. The Homestead, as they called it, is one of the oldest houses in the local area, its design was simple but elegant, with wide verandahs, and the interior of the house featured cedar woodwork. The Johnston family has been commemorated by Johnston Road.

Street names in Georges Hall commemorate two First World War Soldiers - Lord Birdwood is immortalised by Birdwood Avenue, and another great soldier - Haig, by Haig Avenue.

== Heritage listings ==
Georges Hall has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 1a Lionel Street: The Homestead

==Parks and reserves==
Garrison Point is located near the junction of Georges River and Prospect Creek. Adjacent to Garrison Point is Lake Gillawarna, an artificial lake that forms an important breeding ground for native birds.

Garrison Point and Lake Gillawarna form the southern part of a larger reserve called Mirambeena Regional Park that extends into the adjacent suburb of Lansvale. A short distance south from Garrison Point is Kentucky Reserve, another recreational park area overlooking the Georges River, adjacent to Henry Lawson Drive.

==Population==
After WW2 Georges Hall expanded significantly with a large number of Eastern European refugees building homes in the area after migrating to Australia in the late 1940s and 1950s.

According to the , there were 9,739 residents in Georges Hall. The majority of residents (62.2%) were born in Australia. Of those born outside of Australia, the top countries of birth were Lebanon 6.9%, Vietnam 5.0%, Greece 1.5%, Syria 1.4% and Italy 1.4%. 43.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 23.5%, Vietnamese 7.3%, Greek 3.9%, Italian 1.9% and Macedonian 1.7%. The most common responses for religion in Georges Hall were Catholic 26.7%, Islam 24.7%, Not stated 10.1%, Eastern Orthodox 10.1% and No Religion 10.1%. Home ownership was popular, with 39.4% of people owning their home outright and 38.2% were paying off their home with a mortgage.

* Calvary Chapel Christian School
* Georges Hall Public School
* St. Mary&#x27;s, Queen of Heaven Primary School

* Bankstown Airport – a metropolitan airport
* Dunc Gray Velodrome
* The Reservoir
* Mirambeena Reserve

<doc id="543837" wikidata="Q791469" url="?curid=543837" title="Avro Anson">
<text>The Avro Anson is a British twin-engine, multi-role aircraft built by the aircraft manufacturer Avro. Large numbers of the type served in a variety of roles for the Royal Air Force (RAF), Fleet Air Arm (FAA), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Royal Australian Air Force and numerous other air forces before, during, and after the Second World War.

Initially known as the &quot;Avro 652A&quot;, the Anson was developed during the mid-1930s from the earlier Avro 652 airliner in response to a request for tenders issued by the British Air Ministry for a coastal maritime reconnaissance aircraft. Having suitably impressed the Ministry, a single prototype was ordered, which conducted its maiden flight on 24 March 1935. Following an evaluation in which the Type 652A bettered the competing de Havilland DH.89, it was selected as the winner, leading to Air Ministry Specification 18/35 being written around the type and an initial order for 174 aircraft being ordered in July 1935. The Type 652A was promptly named after British Admiral George Anson.

The type was placed into service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was initially used in the envisaged maritime reconnaissance operation alongside the larger flying boats. After the outbreak of the Second World War, the Anson was soon found to have become obsolete in front-line combat roles. Large numbers of the type were instead put to use as a multi-engine aircrew trainer, having been found to be suitable for the role, and became the mainstay of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The type continued to be used in this role throughout and after the conflict, remaining in RAF service as a trainer and communications aircraft until 28 June 1968.

Post-war, a small number of Ansons (known as Avro 19s) were built new for the civilian market, along with a much larger number of civil conversions from surplus military stocks, being used as light transport and executive aircraft. By the end of production in 1952, a total of 8,138 Ansons had been constructed by Avro in nine variants. A further 2,882 aircraft were manufactured by Federal Aircraft Ltd in Canada from 1941. By the 21st century, the vast majority of Ansons had been retired, but three aircraft still appear at flying displays.

==Development==
In 1933, the British Air Ministry proposed that the Royal Air Force (RAF) acquire a relatively cheap landplane for coastal maritime reconnaissance duties; the proposed aircraft would perform as a supplement to the more capable, but expensive, flying boats which the RAF had adopted for conducting maritime reconnaissance missions. The Air Ministry looked for designs from British manufacturers. Avro responded to the request with the &quot;Avro 652A&quot;, which was a modified version of their earlier Avro 652, a twin-engined, six-seat monoplane airliner. de Havilland offered a design based on their D.H.89A Dragon Rapide biplane. After evaluating the various submissions received, the Air Ministry decided to order from Avro and de Havilland respectively, single examples of the Type 652A and the de Havilland DH.89 for evaluation purposes late in 1934; an evaluation and the subsequent selection of a design for production to take place by May 1935.

On 24 March 1935, the Avro 652A conducted its maiden flight at Woodford Aerodrome, Greater Manchester. Between 11 and 17 May 1935, the prototype participated in a formal evaluation against the competing DH.89M by the RAF&#x27;s Coastal Defence Development Unit at RAF Gosport, Hampshire. During these trials, the Avro aircraft proved to be superior and was accordingly selected as the winner of the competition on 25 May 1935. In response to its selection, Air Ministry Specification G.18/35 was written around the Type 652A; in July 1935, an initial order for 174 aircraft, which had been given the service name &quot;Anson&quot;, was received.

On 31 December 1935, the first production Anson performed its maiden flight; changes from the prototype included an enlarged horizontal tailplane and reduced elevator span in order to improve stability. Additionally, while the prototype had not been fitted with flaps, production aircraft could accommodate their installation from the onset to increase the viable glide angle and reduce landing speed. On 6 March 1936, deliveries to the RAF commenced. By the end of production in 1952, a total of 11,020 Ansons had been completed, which made it the second most numerous (after approximately 11,500 Vickers Wellington medium bomber) British multi-engined aircraft of the Second World War.

==Design==

The Avro Anson was a twin-engine, low-wing cantilever monoplane. Developed as a general reconnaissance aircraft, it possessed many features that lent itself to the role, including considerable load-carrying ability, and long range. The structure of the Anson was relatively straightforward and uncomplicated, relying on proven methods and robust construction to produce an airframe that minimized maintenance requirements. Much of the internal structure retained similarities to the earlier Avro 652 airliner from which it had been developed. The Anson Mk I was furnished with a low-mounted one-piece wooden wing, composed of a combination of plywood and spruce throughout the wingbox and ribs. The fuselage was composed of a welded steel tubing framework which was principally clad in fabric; the exterior of the nose was clad in magnesium alloy.

The Anson was powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah IX seven-cylinder air-cooled radial engines, which were each rated at . Each engine was provided with its own duplicated fuel pumps and separate fuel and oil tanks; the tanks were composed of welded aluminium and mounted in cradles housed within the wing. The engine cowlings were intentionally designed to have a reduced diameter in order to reduce their negative impact on external visibility, which was considered to be valuable to the type&#x27;s reconnaissance function. These engines drove two-bladed Fairey-built metal propellers.

The Anson was the first aircraft equipped with retractable landing gear to enter service with the RAF. While the main undercarriage was retracted into recesses set into the bottom of the engine nacelles, the tail wheel was fixed in position. Commonly, the undercarriage was fitted with Dunlop-built wheels, tyres and pneumatic brakes and Turner legs. The retractable undercarriage was mechanically operated by hand; 144 turns of a crank handle, situated beside the pilot&#x27;s seat, were needed. To avoid this laborious process, early aircraft would often perform short flights with the landing gear remaining extended throughout, which would reduce the aircraft&#x27;s cruising speed by 30 mph (50 km/h).
Initially, the Anson was flown by a crew of three, which comprised a pilot, a navigator/bomb-aimer and a radio operator/gunner, when it was used in the maritime reconnaissance role; from 1938 onwards, it was typically operated by a four-man crew. The bomb-aimer would perform his function from a prone position in the forward section of the nose, which was provisioned with a bombsight, driftsight, and other appropriate instrumentation, including a landing light. The pilot was located in a cockpit behind the bomb aimer&#x27;s position and was provided with a variety of contemporary instrumentation, including those to enable flight under instrument flight rules (IFR) and indirect instrument lighting for night flying purposes.

Immediately behind the pilot&#x27;s position is a small folding seat fixed to the starboard side of the fuselage for an additional crew member or passenger, along with racks that would contain a pair of parachute packs that would be clipped onto the harnesses worn by both the pilot and the navigator. Behind these is the navigator&#x27;s station, a chair and table provisioned with navigational aids such as compasses, Bigsworth chart boards, sea markers, slide rules for course, wind and speed, a signalling lamp and float flares. Aft of the rear spar is the wireless operator&#x27;s station – a table with contemporary wireless equipment, including a winch for the trailing aerial, which was attached to the upper fuselage immediately behind the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit.

The armaments of the Anson consisted of a single .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun which was fixed within the forward fuselage and aimed by the pilot, while an Armstrong Whitworth-built manually operated gun turret located on the Anson&#x27;s dorsal section was fitted with a single Lewis gun. Additionally, up to of bombs, which could consist of a maximum of two and eight bombs, could be carried in the aircraft&#x27;s wings. Those Ansons that were used in the training role were outfitted with dual controls and usually had the gun turret removed, although specific aircraft used for gunnery training were fitted with a Bristol hydraulically operated gun turret, similar to that used in the Bristol Blenheim. The tail fairing of the starboard nacelle contains an inflatable dinghy which is provided with automatic actuators and marine distress beacons.

==Operational history==

On 6 March 1936, the Anson entered RAF service, No. 48 Squadron was the first RAF unit to be equipped with the type. Upon the type&#x27;s introduction, it represented a new level of capability for the service, serving not only in a general reconnaissance capacity but also being an effective general-purpose aircraft In July 1937, a Coastal Command Anson was fitted with an experimental airborne early warning radar which was able to detect large warships away in poor visibility and was successfully used in fleet exercises off the east coast of England in September.

By the outbreak of the Second World War, the RAF had received a total of 824 Ansons while there were 26 RAF squadrons that were then operating the Anson I: 10 of these were assigned to Coastal Command and the other 16 were with Bomber Command. By 1939, all of the squadrons assigned to Bomber Command that had been equipped with the Anson I served as operational training squadrons which were used to prepare crews for frontline service. 12 of the squadrons were in No. 6 (Operational Training) Group. Newly formed crews, having previously completed individual flying and technical training courses, were first trained as bomber crews in Ansons before advancing to the various frontline aircraft types, which were in the same squadrons with the Ansons. After training the crews would advance to the frontline bomber squadrons with aircraft such as the Fairey Battle, Bristol Blenheim, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley or Handley-Page Hampden.
Even before the start of the war, it had been realized that the Anson&#x27;s limited capabilities would make it ineffective in its intended main role as a maritime patrol aircraft. In 1938, it had been decided to replace the Anson in this role with the American-built Lockheed Hudson, which was 100 mph faster, had three times the range, carried a much heavier bomb load and had a superior defensive armament. The first squadron to be reequipped with the type was already training with them in September 1939. Meanwhile, the remaining Coastal Command Anson squadrons had to go to war with what they had. The Anson had an endurance of only four hours so it could only be employed in the North Sea and other coastal areas; however, it lacked the range to reach the coast of Norway. Its weapons against German U-boats were two small 100 lb bombs, which required a direct hit on the hull of a submarine to be effective, at least in theory. On 3 December 1939, an Anson mistakenly attacked a surfaced Royal Navy submarine, , and although the aircraft succeeded in hitting the conning tower, the only damage was four broken light bulbs. In an earlier friendly fire incident off the coast of Scotland in September, the bombs of an Anson of No. 233 Squadron had bounced off the surface of the water and exploded in an air burst, which holed the aircraft&#x27;s fuel tanks causing it to ditch off St Andrews. Despite numerous claims of attacks on U-boats by Ansons in the first months of the war, postwar examination of German records showed that little damage had been inflicted. Despite their obsolescence, Ansons were employed during the Dunkirk evacuation to deter attacks on Allied shipping by German E-boats. On 1 June 1940, a flight of three Ansons was attacked near Dunkirk by nine Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109s. According to the unsubstantiated claims, one Anson destroyed two German aircraft and damaged a third, while no Ansons were lost.

The aircraft achieved more success training pilots for flying multi-engined bombers, such as the Avro Lancaster. Ansons were first deployed to Flying Training Schools in November 1936, replacing the obsolete bombers then used for twin-engine training. The Anson was also used to train the other members of a bomber&#x27;s aircrew, such as navigators, wireless operators, bomb aimers and air gunners. Postwar, the Anson continued in the training and light transport roles. The last Ansons were withdrawn from RAF service with communications units on 28 June 1968.

During the 1939–45 war years, the British Air Transport Auxiliary operated the Anson as its standard taxi aircraft, using it to carry groups of ferry pilots to and from aircraft collection points. There was no fatal mechanical failure of an Anson in ATA service, and it was typically very well regarded.

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) initially ordered 33 Ansons in November 1935 to fill the maritime reconnaissance role. The first were delivered in 1936 and 48 were in service before the start of the war. The RAAF eventually operated a total of 1,028 Ansons, the majority of these being Mk Is. These aircraft continued to be operated until 1955.

The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) operated 23 Ansons as navigation trainers during the Second World War, (alongside the more numerous Airspeed Oxford), and acquired more Ansons as communication aircraft immediately after the war. A preserved navigation trainer is in the Air Force Museum of New Zealand at Wigram.

The Royal Indian Air Force operated several Ansons as part of the &quot;No.1 Service Flying Training School (India)&quot; for Pilot and Navigation training. These Ansons continued this role post-independence and were retired at an unknown date.

The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) operated 4,413 Anson aircraft, 1,962 British built and 2,451 Canadian built aircraft. The RCN operated the aircraft until 1952. Although the Canadian Ansons were used throughout the training schools of the British Commonwealth Air Training plan for training aircrew, some aircraft were pressed into operational service with the RCAF&#x27;s Eastern Air Command. A good example of the training schools&#x27; involvement in combat operations with the EAC during the emergency of the battle is illustrated in an article dated 1 March 2006 of the Royal Canadian Legion magazine entitled &quot;Eastern Air Command: Air Force, Part 14&quot;; the author Hugh A. Haliday wrote: &quot;The need for Atlantic patrols was undiminished, yet the Battle of the St. Lawrence stretched EAC resources. Based at Charlottetown, 31 General Reconnaissance School was mobilized to fly patrols using Avro Ansons, each carrying two 250-pound bombs. At the very outset of the war, the Anson and its ordnance had failed in RAF anti-submarine work. Now in Canada, it was remobilized as an aerial scarecrow. German views varied as to Canadian countermeasures. The captain of U-517 found his operations increasingly restricted by strengthened air patrols. In October 1942, U-69 reported &quot;strong sea patrol and constant patrol by aircraft with radar.&quot;

The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), employed 50 Canadian-built Ansons, which were designated the AT-20.

The Egyptian Air Force (EAF) operated a fleet of Ansons in communications and VIP duties. A specially outfitted Anson was presented to the then King of Egypt by the RAF. The Royal Afghan Air Force obtained 13 Anson 18 aircraft for various duties from 1948. These aircraft survived until 1972.

===Postwar civil use===

After the war, Ansons continued in production with Avro at Woodford. At this time, large amounts of the type were being converted for civilian use, where they were operated as light transports by a range of small charter airlines and as executive aircraft by large corporations. Countries that saw civilian operations with Ansons included the United Kingdom, Canada (Mk. V aircraft only), Australia and Mexico.
Railway Air Services operated Ansons on scheduled services from London&#x27;s Croydon Airport via Manchester to Belfast (Nutts Corner) in 1946 and 1947. Sivewright Airways operated three Mk XIX aircraft from their Manchester Airport base on local charter flights, flights to Jersey, and Ronaldsway Airport in the Isle of Man until 1951. Finglands Airways operated an ex-RAF Anson I on inclusive tour flights and on scheduled flights from Manchester Airport to Newquay Airport between 1949 and 1952. Kemps Aerial Surveys operated several Anson XIXs on survey work within the UK until their retirement in 1973.

In 1948, India ordered 12 new Anson 18Cs for use by the Directorate of Civil Aviation as trainers and communications aircraft; these were delivered from Yeadon in the spring of 1949.

Ansons continued to be manufactured by Avro at Woodford for the RAF until March 1952; the type was used as trainers and served in the role of Station communications aircraft until 1968.

The wooden wings of Ansons flying in Australia were found to fail at a high rate. The phenolic glue bonds would part, and it was speculated that the problem was due to the high humidity. In 1962, the Commonwealth Government decided to ground the majority of wooden-winged aircraft then in operation; amongst those aircraft affected, the Anson and De Havilland Mosquito were included. Of the Ansons, no such aircraft were re-registered as the government had mandated a test that essentially destroyed the wings, thus requiring the fitting of new wings. Most owners decided to voluntarily scrap their aircraft well before this time.

During the late 20th century, the vast majority of Ansons were retired, but there are still three aircraft appearing at flying displays, two in the UK, one in New Zealand. A fourth aircraft in Canada is scheduled for restoration back to airworthiness.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 11 September 1937, Anson K8778 of No. 233 Squadron RAF crashed in poor visibility on the Gisborough Moor escarpment, above Guisborough in the North Riding of Yorkshire, while returning from an exercise with the Royal Navy; all four crew were killed.

* On 13 April 1941, Anson N9857 of 19 Operational Training Unit from RAF Kinloss crashed on Beinn an Fhurain at an altitude of approximately east of Inchnadamph. At least 4 of the 6 aircrew survived the crash but died of exposure in blizzard conditions. Their bodies are buried at the crash site.
* On 17 April 1942, Anson W2630 of RAF Wigtown crashed into the east side of Galloway mountain Cairnsmore of Fleet near Creetown, southwest Scotland. The aircraft exploded on impact, killing the pilot and a civilian passenger. The wireless operator survived with severe burns. 
* On 2 July 1942, Anson Mk.I N5297 of No.2 Observers Advanced Flying Unit (O)AFU crashed on Shalloch-on-Minnoch, South Ayrshire, during a navigation training flight out of Millom, Cumbria. All five airmen, including three trainees, were killed.
* On 9 October 1942, four Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) airmen were killed when their Anson crashed near Clackline, Western Australia. The crew are commemorated by the Avro Anson Memorial.
* On 30 October 1942, an Anson took off from Sidney airport on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, with Royal Canadian Air Force Sgt. William Baird and British Air Force Pilot Officer Charles Fox, Pilot Officer Anthony Lawrence and Sgt. Robert Luckock aboard. The aircraft crashed, killing all aboard, from takeoff, on a remote mountainside near Port Renfrew. The wreckage and remains of the crew were found by loggers in October 2013 and recovered in May 2014.
* On 2 November 1942, Anson DG919 of 67 Squadron RAAF (attached Laverton) crashed at Mallacoota Airfield in Victoria, Australia, killing crew members Sergeant John Hueston Sawrey, Sergeant Leonard Arthur Lupton and Sergeant Ralph Cassidy.

* On 28 November 1942, Anson I N9838 of 38 Air Navigation School (Canada) RAF operating from RCAF Port Albert was lost over Lake Huron during a routine night-time training mission. The aircraft&#x27;s last position was recorded approximately 15 minutes flying time from the airfield, after which contact was lost. The bodies of pilot, Sergeant Leslie Shaw, Flight Sergeant Robert Brown (of the Free French Airforce - also known as Robert Basquin), Leading Aircraftman Cecil James and Aircraftman First Class William Addis were never recovered. No official cause for the crash was identified but it was speculated that wing icing may have contributed.
* On 7 December 1943, another piggy-back accident occurred when RCAF #18 SFTS Anson II JS193 came down on top of Anson II JS167 in the landing circuit at Gimli, Manitoba. Both aircraft landed safely still entangled, and both were later repaired.
* On 19 January 1944, RCAF #2 Training Command, Anson II #7164 landed on top of Anson II #8561 and again both landed safely but entangled. Anson #7164 was a write-off, but #8561 was repaired.

<doc id="543839" wikidata="Q1932313" url="?curid=543839" title="Formiciinae">
<text>Formiciinae is an extinct subfamily of ants known from Eocene deposits in Europe and North America.

==Genera==
*Formiciinae 
**Formiciini 
***&quot;Titanomyrma&quot; 
****&quot;Titanomyrma gigantea&quot; 
****&quot;Titanomyrma lubei&quot; 
****&quot;Titanomyrma simillima&quot; 
***&quot;Formicium&quot; (collective group genus)
****&quot;Formicium berryi&quot; 
****&quot;Formicium brodiei&quot; 
****&quot;Formicium mirabile&quot; 

The type genus is &quot;Formicium&quot; with the genus &quot;Titanomyrma&quot; being described in 2011. &quot;Formicium&quot; includes the described species which are known from fossil wings only. &quot;Formicium&quot; is known from three species. &quot;Formicium mirabile&quot;, named by Theodore D. A. Cockerell in 1920, and &quot;Formicium brodiei&quot;, named by John O. Westwood in 1854, are both known from fore wings found in the middle Eocene of Bournemouth, Dorset, England. The third species named, &quot;Formicium berryi&quot; was named by Frank M. Carpenter in 1929 from the middle Eocene Claiborne Formation in Puryear, Tennessee, USA, though he misidentified the formation as the Wilcox Formation. &quot;F. berryi&quot; was the first described occurrence of the genus and, until 2011, the subfamily, in North America. With the description of &quot;Titanomyrma&quot;, the two species already described from complete body specimens, &quot;Formicium giganteum&quot; and &quot;F. simillimum&quot;, were transferred to the new genus as &quot;Titanomyrma giganteum&quot; and &quot;T. simillimum&quot; respectively. &quot;Titanomyrma&quot; also contains a third species, &quot;T. lubei&quot; described in the same paper as the genus and which is the second member of the subfamily known from North America.

==Size==
While workers belonging to the subfamily have not been found, queens and males for &quot;T. giganteum&quot; and &quot;T. simillimum&quot; are known and &quot;T. lubei&quot; is known from a single queen. The average size for the queens and males in &quot;Titanomyrma&quot; is equal to that of some of the largest modern ants known. Only the queens of &quot;Dorylus wilverthi&quot; currently reach similar lengths, up to as the smallest species of &quot;Titanomyrma&quot;, &quot;T. lubei&quot;.

Formiciinae members were restricted in habitat to living in regions which had a mesic wet climate and an average mean annual temperature of or higher. This is similar to the restricted ranges of the largest species of modern ants. The spread of the subfamily from Europe to North America is postulated to have been across the North Atlantic landbridges which were present in the Eocene. While the average temperatures for this route are thought to have been lower than the range needed for Formiciinae species, a series of warmer events throughout the Eocene are suggested as aides in the crossing.

<text>Charles Sturt University is an Australian multi-campus public university located in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. Established in 1989, it was named in honour of Captain Charles Sturt, a British explorer who made expeditions into regional New South Wales and South Australia.

It is the largest regional university in Australia, offering a multidisciplinary spectrum of courses in collaboration with various partners across the country.

==History==
The history of Charles Sturt University dates back to 1895 with the establishment of the Bathurst Experiment Farm. The university was established on 1 July 1989 from the merger of several existing separately-administered Colleges of Advanced Education by the &quot;Charles Sturt University Act 1989&quot; (Act No. 76, 1989).

The constituent colleges included the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga, and the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga. The Mitchell College of Advanced Education was formed on 1 January 1970, and the Riverina Murray Institute of Education campus in Wagga Wagga and Albury-Wodonga had operated since 1984. The latter institution had earlier succeeded the Riverina College of Advanced Education, which was itself the result of an even earlier merger between Wagga Agricultural College and the Wagga Wagga Teachers College.

Charles Sturt established a Study Centre in Sydney in 1998 and in Melbourne in 2007. These Study Centres were operated by a private education group called Study Group Australia. On 31 December 2022, Charles Sturt let its relationship with Study Group Australia expire. According to Charles Sturt&#x27;s website, the Brisbane Study Centre is closed, and courses at the Sydney and Melbourne locations are in teach-out mode.

In 1998, the Goulburn campus was established to deliver policing education to New South Wales Police.

In 1999, the Dubbo campus foundation stone was laid. The university also launched its China Joint Cooperation Program with four universities in China.

On 1 January 2005, Charles Sturt formalised moves to assume control of University of Sydney&#x27;s Orange campus, which came into effect on 1 January 2005. Between 2005 and 2015, the university had expanded to include an offshore campus in Burlington, Ontario, in Canada. In July 2015, Charles Sturt ceased to operate its Ontario campus due to the legislative and regulatory environment in Ontario.

In 2005, Charles Sturt responded to the shortage of veterinarians in rural and regional Australia with the first veterinary science students starting their degrees at the Wagga Wagga campus. In 2008, the university also offered dentistry courses for the first time. This led to the development of five community-based clinics across its regional campuses.

On 14 February 2011, Charles Sturt University changed its logo. The Sturt&#x27;s desert pea flower (&quot;Swainsona formosa&quot;) was stylised and made prominent, with the full name of the university as part of its logo.

On 1 May 2012, a milestone was reached as the university opened a new campus in Port Macquarie, its first coastal regional campus, making higher education accessible to the Port Macquarie-Hastings region.

In 2013, the university implemented a gas engine cogeneration power plant to help minimise fuel costs and carbon emissions.

On 18 April 2016, staff and students at the Port Macquarie campus moved into the first stage of their purpose-built campus. The second stage was completed in 2020 and included a New South Wales emergency services training room, an innovation hub, and student support facilities. The third stage is scheduled for completion over the coming years, with an expected student intake of 5,000 by 2030.

On 28 July 2016, Charles Sturt was declared Australia&#x27;s First Official Carbon Neutral University. The Government of Australia&#x27;s Carbon Neutral Program certified the university as &quot;carbon neutral&quot; against the National Carbon Offset Standard.

On 9 May 2018, Charles Sturt and Western Sydney University announced a partnership with the Australian Government&#x27;s network to establish the Murray-Darling Medical School, providing joint medical programs across the Murray-Darling Basin region. Charles Sturt&#x27;s teaching base was established at the university&#x27;s Orange campus to extend on the existing Western Sydney University program.

In May 2019, for its 30th anniversary, the university announced its new branding and visual identity. This included a new crest that drew on the original coat of arms and the logos of its predecessor institutions. The crest&#x27;s design includes patterns that draw on the culture and symbolism of First Nations Australians and echo the landscapes of regional New South Wales.

On 29 May 2019, Charles Sturt University announced it joined the Regional Universities Network (RUN), becoming the seventh member of the group.

In March 2021, Charles Sturt University&#x27;s first medical students commenced study at the university&#x27;s Orange campus as part of the Joint Program in Medicine with Western Sydney University. The Joint Program in Medicine is designed to train doctors in the regions to help address the shortfall in rural and regional medical professionals.

<text>Rudolf Sremec (18 August 1909 – 16 August 1999) was a Yugoslav and Croatian film director. He is regarded as one of the most important Croatian authors of short documentary films. In a career spanning four decades, Sremec directed and wrote some 90 documentary shorts, mainly dealing with various cultural and anthropological topics.

Born in Vinkovci, Sremec graduated from the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences with a degree in Slavic studies and French language. Sremec began making films in 1945 after spending some time working as a high school teacher.

Apart from documentaries, he directed a handful of live-action short films and he also wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Substitute&quot; (&quot;Surogat&quot;; 1961), a short animated film directed by Dušan Vukotić which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

Sremec spent a number of years working at the Croatian Radiotelevision and directed a 1981 two-part television film &quot;August Šenoa&quot; about Croatian writer August Šenoa. He was also a prolific film critic, editor of the &quot;Filmska kultura&quot; film magazine and taught courses in film history and film theory at the comparative literature department of the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Sremec was honoured with the Vladimir Nazor Award for life achievement in film in 1976.

<doc id="543848" wikidata="Q515924" url="?curid=543848" title="Don Dunstan">
<text>Donald Allan Dunstan (21 September 1926 – 6 February 1999) was an Australian politician who served as the 35th premier of South Australia from 1967 to 1968, and again from 1970 to 1979. He was a member of the House of Assembly (MHA) for the division of Norwood from 1953 to 1979, and leader of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party from 1967 to 1979. Before becoming premier, Dunstan served as the 38th attorney-general of South Australia and the treasurer of South Australia. He is the fourth longest serving premier in South Australian history.

In the late 1950s, Dunstan became well known for his campaign against the death penalty being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl, opposing then-Premier Thomas Playford over the matter. During Labor&#x27;s time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights and in Labor abandoning the White Australia policy. Dunstan became Attorney-General after the 1965 election, and replaced the older Frank Walsh as premier in 1967. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the Liberal and Country League (LCL), Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander, convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. With little change in Labor&#x27;s vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election, and again in 1973, 1975, and 1977.

Dunstan&#x27;s socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, the first female judge (Dame Roma Mitchell) appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later the first Indigenous governor, Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council, the upper house of Parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment. He also established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraging arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, and the establishment of the South Australian Film Corporation.

At the same time, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan&#x27;s pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan&#x27;s administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. The strain on Dunstan was increased by the death of his wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he lived for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.

==Early life and education==
Donald Allan Dunstan was born on 21 September 1926 in Suva, Colony of Fiji, the son of Francis Vivian Dunstan and Ida May Dunstan (&quot;&quot; Hill), Australians of Cornish descent. His parents had moved to Fiji in 1916 after his father took up a position as manager of the Adelaide Steamship Company. He spent the first seven years of his life in Fiji, starting his schooling there. Dunstan was beset by illness, and his parents sent him to South Australia hoping the drier climate would assist his recovery. He lived in Murray Bridge for three years with his mother&#x27;s parents before returning to Suva for a short period during his secondary education. During his time in Fiji, Dunstan mixed easily with the Indian settlers and indigenous people, something that was frowned upon by many of the white people on the islands.

He won a scholarship in classical studies and attended St Peter&#x27;s College, a traditional private school for the sons of the Adelaide establishment. He developed public speaking and acting skills, winning the college&#x27;s public speaking prize for two consecutive years. In 1943, he portrayed the title role in a production of John Drinkwater&#x27;s play &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, and according to the school magazine, he &quot;was the chief contributor to the success of the occasion&quot;. His academic strengths were in classical history and languages, and he disliked mathematics. He gained a reputation as a maverick. During this time, Dunstan did not board and lived in the seaside suburb of Glenelg with relatives. Dunstan completed his secondary schooling in 1943, ranking in the top 30 overall in the statewide matriculation examinations.

In his youth, influenced by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was a supporter of the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: &quot;I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that I was brought up into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain.&quot; When asked of his roots, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!&quot;

His political awakening happened during his university years. Studying law and arts at the University of Adelaide, he became very active, joining the University Socialist Club, the Fabian Society, the Student Representative Council, as well as the Theatre Group. A two-week stint in the Communist Party was followed by membership in the Australian Labor Party.

Dunstan was markedly different from the general membership of the Labor Party of the time; upon applying for membership at Trades Hall, a Labor veteran supposedly muttered &quot;how could that long-haired prick be a Labor man?&quot; His peculiarities, such as his upper-class accent, were a target of derision by the working-class Labor old guard throughout his early political involvement. Dunstan funded his education by working in theatre and radio during his university years. He eventually graduated with a double degree, with arts majors in Latin, comparative philology, history and politics, and he came first in political science.

After Dunstan graduated, he moved with his wife to Fiji where he was admitted to the bar and began his career as a lawyer. They returned to Adelaide in 1951 and settled in George Street, Norwood, taking in boarders as a source of extra income.

==Political beginnings==
Dunstan was nominated as the Labor candidate for the electoral district of Norwood at the 1953 election. His campaign was noted for his colourful methods to sway voters: posters of his face were placed on every pole in the district, and Labor supporters walked the streets advocating Dunstan. He targeted in particular the large Italian migrant population of the district, distributing translated copies of a statement the sitting LCL member Roy Moir had made about immigrants. Moir had commented that &quot;these immigrants are of no use to usa few of them are tradesmen but most of them have no skills at all. And when they intermarry we&#x27;ll have all the colours of the rainbow.&quot; Dunstan won the seat and was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly. His son Andrew was born nine months after the win.
Dunstan was to become the most vocal opponent of the LCL Government of Sir Thomas Playford, strongly criticising its practice of electoral malapportionment, known as the Playmander, a pun on the term gerrymander. This system gave a disproportionate electoral weight to the LCL&#x27;s rural base, with votes worth as much as ten times others − at the 1968 election the rural seat of Frome had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of Enfield had 42,000 formal votes. He added colour and flair to debate in South Australian politics, changing the existing &quot;gentlemanly&quot; method of conducting parliamentary proceedings. He did not fear direct confrontation with the incumbent government and attacked it with vigour. Up to this point most of his Labor colleagues had become dispirited by the Playmander and were resigned to the ongoing dominance of Playford and LCL, so they sought to influence policy through collaborative legislating.

In 1954, the LCL introduced the Government Electoral Bill, which was designed to further accentuate the undue weight favouring rural voters. During the debate, Dunstan decried this &quot;immoral Bill... I cannot separate it from the motives of those who put it forward. Since it is immoral, so are they.&quot; Such language, unusually aggressive by the prevailing standards, resulted in Dunstan&#x27;s removal from the parliamentary chambers after he refused a request from the Speaker to retract his remark. The first parliamentarian to be expelled in years, Dunstan found himself on the front pages of newspapers for the first time. Nevertheless, he was not able to build up much of a profile in his first few years as &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, the dominant newspaper in the city, had a policy of ignoring the young politician&#x27;s activities—its editor Lloyd Dumas was the father of one of Dunstan&#x27;s first girlfriends.

==Max Stuart trial==

In December 1958 there occurred an event that initially had nothing to do with Playford, but eventually intensified into a debacle regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule. Dunstan was prominent in pressuring Playford during this time.

A young girl was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aboriginal man, was convicted and sentenced to be executed. Stuart&#x27;s lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. Amid objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, &quot;The News&quot; brought much attention to Stuart&#x27;s plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.

When Playford and the Executive Council decided not to reprieve Stuart, an appeal to the Privy Council was made to stall the execution. Spearheaded by Dunstan, Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging. Amid hue and cry, Playford started a Royal Commission to review the case. However, two of the commissioners had already been involved in the trial and one of the appeals. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from Dunstan and Labor, who also attacked Playford for what they regarded as a too-restrictive scope of inquiry.

The Royal Commission began its work and the proceedings were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart&#x27;s sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.
Amid the continuing uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. The Royal Commission concluded that the guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against the handling of the matter (including Dunstan) thought Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford&#x27;s administration, while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.

From 1959 onwards, the LCL government clung to power with the support of two independents, as Labor gained momentum. Always at the forefront, Dunstan lambasted the government for perceived underspending on social welfare, education, health and the arts. Dunstan heavily promoted himself as a reformer.

In 1960, Dunstan became president of the State Labor Party. The year also saw the death of Opposition Leader Mick O&#x27;Halloran and his replacement by Frank Walsh. Dunstan attempted to win the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical of his age and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.

==Ascent to power==
Federally, Dunstan, together with fellow Australian Fabian Society member Gough Whitlam, set about removing the White Australia policy from the Labor platform. The older trade-unionist-based members of the Labor Party vehemently opposed changing the status quo. However, the &quot;New Guard&quot; of the party, of which Dunstan was a part, were determined to bring about its end. Attempts in 1959 and 1961 failed, with Labor leader Arthur Calwell stating, &quot;It would ruin the Party if we altered the immigration policy... it was only cranks, long hairs, academics and do-gooders who wanted the change.&quot; However, Dunstan persisted in his efforts, and in 1965 it was removed from the Labor platform at their national conference; Dunstan personally took credit for the change. Whitlam later brought about the comprehensive end of the White Australia policy in 1973 as Prime Minister of Australia.

Dunstan pursued similar reforms with respect to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was introduced to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians in the past and had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aboriginal people. Dunstan was prominent in Labor&#x27;s opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to Aboriginal reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aboriginal people failed, as did his proposal to ensure that at least half of the members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aboriginal people, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.

Labor won the seats of Glenelg and Barossa at the 1965 election, after winning the seats of Chaffey and Unley at the 1962 election. Labor thus finally overcame the Playmander and formed government for the first time in 32 years, with Frank Walsh as Premier of South Australia. Despite winning 55 percent of the primary vote, the Playmander was still strong enough that Labor won only 21 of 39 seats, a two-seat majority. Dunstan became Attorney-General and Minister of Community Welfare and Aboriginal Affairs. He was far and away the youngest member of the cabinet; he was the only minister under 50, and one of only three under 60. Dunstan had a major impact on Government policy as Attorney-General. Having only narrowly lost out on the leadership in 1960, Dunstan became the obvious successor to the 67-year-old Walsh, who was due to retire in 1967 under Labor rules of the time.
The Walsh Government implemented significant reform in its term of office. Liquor, gambling and entertainment laws were overhauled and liberalised, social welfare was gradually expanded and Aboriginal reserves were created. Strong restrictions on Aboriginal access to liquor were lifted. Women&#x27;s working rights were granted under the mantra of &quot;equal pay for work of equal value&quot;, and racial discrimination legislation was enacted. Town planning was codified in law, and the State Planning Authority was created to oversee development. Workers were given more rights and the bureaucracy of the education department was liberalised. Much of the reform was not necessarily radical and was primarily to &quot;fill the gaps&quot; that the previous LCL government had left. Despite a consistently higher statewide vote, Labor were consistently outnumbered 16–4 in the Legislative Council, so some desired legislation did not make it through. In 1965, the legislature convened for 65 days, the most for 34 years, but many bills were still yet to be debated.

Many bills were watered down, but due to lack of public interest, outcry was minimal. In particular, the council blocked electoral reform legislation, paving the way for a probable LCL win at the next election. Such was Dunstan&#x27;s pre-eminence during his term as Attorney-General that the cabinet was often called the &quot;Dunstan Ministry&quot;.

An economic depression had begun in South Australia after the Labor government gained office in 1965; unemployment went from the lowest in the country to the second highest, while immigration levels dropped. Labor was not responsible for the depression, although it initially did little to alleviate it. The Liberals seized on this opportunity, blaming it on &quot;twelve months of Socialist administration in South Australia&quot; and branding it the &quot;Dunstan Depression&quot;.

In the 1966 Australian federal election, Labor suffered a swing against it of 11.8% in South Australia, double the national average. If this was replicated at a state election, it was projected that Labor would hold only ten of the 39 seats. The Liberals dropped Playford as the state leader, and the younger and more progressive Steele Hall took his place. In a dire situation with the next state election looming, Labor changed leaders with Walsh, a &quot;neanderthal figure in the television age&quot;, standing down in May 1967. Much of the Labor Right faction, as well as Walsh, was opposed to Dunstan taking the leadership, but no other MPs had the same charisma or eloquence. Eventually, Dunstan won the leadership over Des Corcoran, winning fourteen votes to eleven on the strength of rural and marginal Laborites, having trailed by one vote on the first count before less popular candidates were eliminated.

Dunstan&#x27;s first Premiership was eventful, with a steady stream of reform and attempts to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.

==Elections 1968–1970==
In preparation for the 1968 election, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this resonated with voters; in surveys conducted in parts of the metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan. In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and the major issues were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy. Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it. With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in the print media, which had long been a bastion of the LCL. Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count, Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of Murray gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber&#x27;s lone independent, Tom Stott, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor. Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.
There was a degree of speculation in the press that Dunstan would call for a new election because of the adverse outcome. However, Dunstan realised the futility of such a move and instead sought to humiliate the LCL into bringing an end to malapportionment. Although Stott&#x27;s decision to support the LCL ended any realistic chance of Dunstan remaining premier, Dunstan did not immediately resign his commission, intending to force Hall and the LCL to demonstrate that they had support on the floor of the Assembly when it reconvened. He used the six weeks before the start of the new legislature to draw attention to malapportionment. Protests were held on 15 March in Light Square. There, Dunstan spoke to a crowd of more than ten thousand: &quot;We need to show that the people of SA feel that at last the watershed has been reached in this, and that they will not continue to put up with a system which is as undemocratic as the present one in SA.&quot;

On 16 April, the first day of the new House&#x27;s sitting, Dunstan lost a confidence vote. With it now clear that the LCL had control of the House, Dunstan tendered his resignation to Governor Edric Bastyan. Hall was then sworn in as premier. However, the six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of the unfairness of the electoral system and put more pressure on the LCL to relent to reforms; it has been seen as one of the most important political events of its time.

With the end of Playford&#x27;s tenure, the LCL had brought younger, more progressive members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, Robin Millhouse. Abortion was partially legalised, and planning for the Festival Centre began. The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the landed gentry, were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; what had once been a united party was now factionalised into four distinct groups across the political spectrum. The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment. During the term in opposition, Des Corcoran became Dunstan&#x27;s deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.

Hall was embarrassed that the LCL was in a position to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. Soon after taking office, he enacted a complete overhaul of the electoral system. While they fell short of &quot;one vote one value&quot; as Labor and Dunstan had demanded, they were still significant. Under the Playmander the lower house had 39 seats, 13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Hall&#x27;s reforms expanded the lower house to 47 seats–28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely.

Stott withdrew support in 1970 over the Chowilla Dam, a dispute over the location of a dam on the Murray River, and South Australia went to the polls. The dam controversy was not much of an election issue, and attempts by the Democratic Labor Party to portray Dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing Australian support for South Vietnam had little effect. The LCL campaigned heavily on Hall, while Dunstan promised sweeping social reform, artistic transformation and more community services. He said &quot;We&#x27;ll set a new standard of social advancement that the whole of Australia will envy. We believe South Australia can set the pace. It can happen here. We can do it.&quot; Dunstan won the 1970 South Australian state election easily, taking 27 seats compared with the LCL&#x27;s 20. Although the share of the votes had been similar to 1968, the dilution of the Playmander had changed the share of the seats. As Labor had attained a majority of the popular vote for a long period, and because malapportionment had been largely ended, the political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch said: &quot;A Dunstan decade seems assured.&quot;

==Dunstan decade==
Dunstan wasted no time in organising his new ministry. He served as his own Treasurer, and took several other portfolios for himself. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios: Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.

Soon after the election, Dunstan travelled to Canberra for the annual Premiers&#x27; Conference as the sole Labor premier. His Government, on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas, sought to appropriate further finances from the Federal Government. This brought Dunstan into conflict with Prime Minister John Gorton, and federal funding to SA was not increased. An appeal was made to the Federal Grants Commission, and Dunstan was awarded more than he had hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were diverted from water-storage schemes in the Adelaide Hills over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.

On the death in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally had the opportunity to put forward a nominee for governor of his own choosing to HM Queen Elizabeth II (and by extension the British Foreign Office which still technically oversaw the appointment process of Australian state governors until the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;): Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen and it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role; Sir Mark Oliphant was uneventfully sworn in. Although the post is mostly ceremonial (with the exception of constitutional responsibilities), Oliphant brought energy to the role and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution. Oliphant&#x27;s tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.
In 1972, the first major developments in regard to the state&#x27;s population growth occurred. Adelaide&#x27;s population was set to increase to 1.3million and the MATS plan and water-storage schemes were in planning to accommodate this. These were summarily rejected by the Dunstan Government, which planned to build a new city 83kilometres from Adelaide, near Murray Bridge. The city, to be known as Monarto, was to be built on farmland to the west of the existing town. Dunstan was very much against allowing Adelaide&#x27;s suburbs to further sprawl, and thus Monarto was a major focus of his government. He argued that the new South Eastern Freeway would allow a drive of only 45 minutes from Adelaide, that the city was not far from current industry, and that water could be readily supplied from the River Murray. The government hoped Adelaide would not sprawl into the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east and that the bureaucracy would be dispersed from the capital. In contrast, public servants feared being forced into the rural settlement. Critics (of whom there were many) derided the project as &quot;Dunstan&#x27;s Versailles in the bush&quot;. Environmental activists aired fears of the effects of Monarto on the River Murray, which was already suffering from pollution and salinity problems. Later on, it was noticed that there was hard bedrock underneath the ground, raising drainage problems.

From 1970 to 1973, much legislation passed through the South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare, drinking laws were further liberalised, an Ombudsman was created, censorship was liberalised, seat belts were made mandatory, the education system was overhauled, and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era). Adelaide&#x27;s water supply was fluoridated in 1971 and the age of majority was lowered from 21 to 18. A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was created, a demerit point system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the road toll, and compensation for workers was improved. Police autonomy and powers were restricted following a rally in opposition to the Vietnam War, which was broken up by police, although Dunstan had wanted the demonstrators to be able to close off the street. A royal commission was called into the police commissioner&#x27;s disregard for Dunstan&#x27;s orders, and resulted in legislation giving the government more control over the police; the commissioner then retired. The dress code for the Parliament was relaxed during this period, the suit and tie was no longer seen as obligatory, and Dunstan himself caused media frenzy when he arrived at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that ended above his knees. After his departure from public life he admitted that his sartorial statement may have gone beyond the limits. Nevertheless, his fashion sense resulted in his being voted &quot;the sexiest political leader in Australia&quot; by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; in 1975, and the image of Dunstan in the shorts remains widely recognized.
Having played a part in Labor&#x27;s abandonment of the White Australia Policy at national level, Dunstan was also prominent in promoting multiculturalism. He was well known for his attendance at and patronage of Cornish, Italian and Greek Australian cultural festivals and his appreciation of Asian art, and sought to build on cultural respect to create trade links with Asia. Dunstan&#x27;s involvement in such cultural exchanges was also credited with generating strong support for Labor from ethnic and non-Anglo-Saxon immigrant communities, although it was viewed with suspicion by some in the Anglo-Saxon establishment. Dunstan himself later recalled: &quot;When I proposed the establishment of a Cornish Festival, in Australia&#x27;s &#x27;Little Cornwall&#x27;, people of Cornish descent came flocking.&quot;

Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing heritage to the march of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide&#x27;s southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.

In pursuit of economic links with the nations of South-East Asia, Dunstan came into contact with the leaders of the Malaysian state of Penang in 1973. Striking a note with Chong Eu Lim, the Chief Minister, Dunstan set about organising cultural and economic engagement between the two states. &quot;Penang Week&quot; was held in Adelaide in July, and in return, &quot;South Australia Week&quot; was held in Penang&#x27;s capital, George Town. In the same year, the Adelaide Festival Centre was openedAustralia&#x27;s first multifunction performing arts complex.

Over a six-year period, government funding for the arts was increased by a factor of seven and in 1978, the South Australian Film Corporation commenced work. During Dunstan&#x27;s time in charge, acclaimed films such as &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; and &quot;Storm Boy&quot; were made in the state. Dunstan&#x27;s support of the arts and fine dining was credited by commentators with attracting artists, craftspeople and writers into the state, helping to change its atmosphere.

The Legislative Council, the upper house of Parliament, was, due to its limited electoral roll, overwhelmingly non-Labor. Unlike the Lower House, its members were elected only by voters who met certain property and wealth requirements. Combined with the remains of the &quot;Playmander&quot; malapportionment, it was difficult for the Labor Party to achieve the representation it wished. The Legislative Council either watered down or outright rejected a considerable amount of Labor legislation; bills to legalise homosexuality, abolish corporal and capital punishment and allow gambling and casinos were rejected. A referendum had indicated support for Friday night shopping, but Labor legislation was blocked in the upper house by the LCL.
Dunstan called an election for March 1973, hoping to gain a mandate to seek changes to the council. The LCL were badly disunited; the more liberal wing of the party under Hall joined Dunstan in wanting to introduce universal suffrage for the upper house, while the more conservative members of the LCL did not. The conservatives then decided to limit Hall&#x27;s powers, resulting in his resignation and creation of the breakaway Liberal Movement (LM), which overtly branded itself as a semi-autonomous component within the LCL. Labor capitalised on the opposition divisions to secure an easy victory. They campaigned under the slogan &quot;South Australia&#x27;s Doing Well with Labor&quot;, while the LCL was hampered by infighting; many LCL candidates were claiming different leaders in their electoral material depending on their factional allegiance. The Labor Party won with 51.5% of the primary vote and secured a second consecutive majority government with 26 seats. It was only the second time a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a second term, the first being the early Thomas Price Labor government. It would be the first five-year-incumbent Labor government however. They also gained two more seats in the Legislative Council to have six of the twenty members. Labor entered the new term with momentum when a fortnight after the election, the LCL purged LM members from its ranks, forcing them to either quit the LM or leave the LCL and join the LM as a distinct party.

Dunstan saw reform of the Legislative Council as an important goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, as a matter of party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would accept them only if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.

During his second term, Dunstan started efforts to build a petrochemical complex at Redcliff, near Port Augusta. Negotiations were held with several multinational companies, but nothing eventuated. Legislation was passed to create a Land Commission and introduce urban land price controls. However, a bill to create &quot;a right to privacy&quot; was defeated in the upper house after protests from journalists, as was legislation to mandate refunds to consumers for returning beverage containers and therefore promote recycling. In 1975, Dunstan declared Australia&#x27;s first legal nude bathing reserve.
Prior to the 1975 federal and state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, had been hit by a series of economic problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode due to a lack of cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia&#x27;s problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: &quot;My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They want you to think we are to blame for Canberra&#x27;s mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia.&quot;

Labor remained the largest party in Parliament, but lost the two-party preferred vote at 49.2% and saw its numbers decrease from 26 to 23. The LCL held 20 seats, the Liberal Movement two, the Country Party one, and the last remaining with an independent, the nominally Labor Mayor of Port Pirie, Ted Connelly. Dunstan appealed to Connelly and offered him the role of Speaker. However, the reforms to the Legislative Council&#x27;s election bore fruit. Of the 11 seats up for election, Labor won six with 47.3% of the vote, and the LM two, allowing Labor a total of 10 seats. This meant they could now, with the help of the LM, push through reforms opposed by the Liberals.

Dunstan continued to try to push through further legislation; he sought to expand on the Hall Government&#x27;s electoral-boundaries reform, to bring it closer to one vote one value. The legislation sought to establish 47 electoral districts containing roughly equal numbers of voters (with a 10% tolerance). Redistributions were to be presided over by an independent boundaries commission. The bill passed with the support of the breakaway LM in the upper houseformer Premier Steele Hall and his former Attorney-General Robin Millhouse.

One famous demonstration of Dunstan&#x27;s charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state&#x27;s social liberalisationwhich he saw as sinfulGod would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised to stand on the seashore at Glenelg and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.

In 1976, the Dunstan Government stepped up its legislative efforts. Some bills, such as the one to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage for the first time in Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto&#x27;s eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia&#x27;s robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan&#x27;s departure, no less than $20million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan&#x27;s greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.

After Oliphant&#x27;s term had expired, Dunstan appointed the first Indigenous Australian Governor, Sir Douglas Nicholls, a former football player and clergyman. Following Nicholls&#x27; resignation due to ill health in 1977, a second consecutive clergyman took the post, Methodist Keith Seaman. However, this appointment was not successful; Seaman became involved in an unspecified scandal and made a statement admitting to a &quot;grave impropriety&quot;, without elaborating further. He did not resign and kept a low profile from then on. Dunstan also appointed Dame Roma Mitchell to become the nation&#x27;s first female Supreme Court judge.

Dunstan broke new ground in Australian politics with his policies on native title for Aboriginal people. The North West Aboriginal Reserve (NWAR) covered more than 7% of the state&#x27;s land, and was inhabited by the Pitjantjatjara people. In 1977, when the NWAR was about to be transferred to the Aboriginal Lands Trust, a tribal delegation asked for the lands to be given to the traditional owners. Dunstan agreed to an investigation, and subsequently introduced the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill. This bill proposed for a tribal body, the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku, to take control of the NWAR and further lands after the claims were cleared by an independent tribunal. It also proposed to allow the body to decide mining proposals on the land and receive royalties. This aroused discontent among mining interests, but a bipartisan parliamentary committee endorsed the bill and it was tabled. However, Labor lost power before the bill was passed and although the new Liberal government said they would remove the mining restrictions, mass public rallies forced them to relent, and a bill similar to Dunstan&#x27;s was passed. The legislation, the bedrock of which was laid by Dunstan, was the most reformist in Australia, and in the 1980s, more than 20% of the land was returned to its traditional owners.

Dunstan called another snap election in September at the 1977 election; he hoped to recover from the previous election, the outcome of which had been affected by the dismissal of the Federal Labor Government. As the remnants of the Playmander had been abolished, conditions were more favourable for Labor and they wanted to end their reliance on the casting vote of the speaker. The campaign proceeded smoothly and exploited the unpopularity of the federal Liberal government, using the jingle &quot;Thank the Lord for South Australia&quot;. Labor won an absolute majority with 51.6% of the primary vote and 27 seats.

===Salisbury affair and departure from office===
Since 1949, there had been a &quot;Special Branch&quot; within the South Australian Police, for the purposes of surveillance and espionage. Conceived in 1939 an &quot;intelligence branch&quot;, to maintain surveillance of the large German Australian community during World War II, it had amassed information on tens of thousands of individuals and organisations. While such an operation troubled Dunstan and his government because of civil liberties concerns, the branch&#x27;s apparent party-political bias was even more worrying. In particular, it held information files on Labor parliamentarians, communists, church leaders and trade unionists, and so-called &quot;pink files&quot; on gay community activists which dated from the time before homosexuality was decriminalised. Although only two Labor MPs, from both federal and state parliaments, did not have files, the branch held significantly fewer files relating to Liberal Party figures. Dunstan had known of the existence of the branch since 1970, but said that he had been assured by the police commissioner that its files were not systematically focused on left-wing political figures.

However, Peter Ward, a journalist and former Dunstan staffer, published a story about the files. An inquiry was conducted into the Special Branch by Justice White of the Supreme Court of South Australia, and the report was placed in Dunstan&#x27;s hands on 21 December 1977. It said the dossiers did exist and that they were &quot;scandalously inaccurate, irrelevant to security purposes and outrageously unfair to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of loyal and worthy citizens&quot;. The report also noted that the files overwhelmingly focused on left-wing politicians and activists, and that Dunstan had been misled by the Police Commissioner, Harold Salisbury. After reviewing the findings, Dunstan sacked Salisbury in January and threatened to make the report public.

However, controversy erupted regarding the inquiry and Dunstan&#x27;s subsequent actions because Salisbury had a reputation as a man of integrity. Ward claimed that Dunstan had known about the true contents of the files for several years. A Royal Commission under Justice Mitchell, set up at the instigation of the Liberals, investigated the matter. It cleared the Dunstan Government of any error, and did not find that it had known about the Special Branch&#x27;s activities earlier. Dunstan had sacked Salisbury for misleading Parliament about the existence of the &quot;pink files&quot; and many of the Special Branch files were burnt. Salisbury retired to the United Kingdom with a $160,000 payout. Stewart Cockburn wrote a book, &quot;The Salisbury Affair&quot;, about the debacle.

There were initially no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained poor and the Redcliff complex was still in limbo, because an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system. However, the Liberal opposition was in a disorganised state and unpopular, so they were not able to pressure Dunstan effectively.

Towards the end of the year, political and media scrutiny of Dunstan began to grow, and he became uneasy in his dealings with the press. Soon after the Salisbury dismissal, he walked out of a stormy media conference after refusing to be drawn on the rumoured sacking of Seaman from the gubernatorial role. Increasing innuendo about Dunstan&#x27;s private life, and allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement were worsened by Dunstan&#x27;s self-righteous tendencies. The premier angrily denied claims that he was using government funds to build an opulent residence in Malaysia, as well as claims about his sexual lifestyle. He pre-emptively called a press conference on one occasion to denounce what he called &quot;idiot rumours&quot; and he further claimed that &quot;reactionary forces&quot; and &quot;right-wing journalists&quot; were engaged in a witchhunt against his &quot;decent and responsible government&quot;.
Dunstan also faced difficulties on policy issues. Factional cracks began to appear in the Labor Party, and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. Mining the uranium promised to provide a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining, on safety grounds, was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but was seen as lacking conviction by environmentalists, and he was also being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, and unemployment was increasing. It was also widely anticipated that a book titled &quot;It&#x27;s Grossly Improper&quot; would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan&#x27;s private life.

Together with Mike Rann, his press secretary and speechwriter (and later Premier), who had worked with him in 1978 on a series of speeches on Aboriginal Land Rights, industrial democracy and women&#x27;s rights, Dunstan made a uranium fact-finding trip to Europe to study safe methods of generating nuclear power and of nuclear waste disposal. By the summer that followed Dunstan became extremely ill. When Parliament resumed, he collapsed on the floor of the House and was forced to use a walking stick; his doctor advised him that he required six months of rest to recover. The Liberal Opposition seized on the state of affairs and charged that the Labor Party was &quot;as ailing as the man who led it&quot;. In a stage-managed press conference on 15 February 1979, Dunstan announced his retirement as premier from his room in Calvary Hospital, clearly shaking and wearing a dressing gown. The book, &quot;It&#x27;s Grossly Improper&quot;, by two Adelaide journalists, Des Ryan and Mike McEwen, was published later that year.

Political scientist Andrew Parkin said one of Dunstan&#x27;s main achievements was to debunk the notion that state governments and parliaments lacked the ability to make significant changes with profound impacts. As evidence, he cited Dunstan&#x27;s sweeping social reforms and the fact that many other state governments followed South Australia&#x27;s lead.

==Life after politics==
After Dunstan&#x27;s resignation from Parliament, deputy Des Corcoran took his place as party leader and Premier. At the subsequent Norwood by-election, Dunstan&#x27;s seat was retained by Labor. Corcoran soon called the 1979 election, which left the party with only 19 seats against the Liberals on 25 seats on an 8.4 percent two-party swing against Labor. The Tonkin Liberal Government came to power and officially abandoned the Monarto project. Dunstan took a trip to Europe after being released from hospital, staying in Perugia for five months and pursuing Italian studies. He subsequently returned home and lived quietly in Adelaide for three years without finding work that appealed to him, such as that related to the shaping of public policy.

During this time, he became increasingly disillusioned with South Australian political affairs. A book by two Adelaide journalists, &quot;It&#x27;s Grossly Improper&quot;, was released in November and sold out within a week. It alleged inappropriate use of government funds and a homosexual affair with a restaurateur, John Ceruto, in return for political favours. There was initial fanfare and speculation as to the authenticity of its claims; Dunstan dismissed the book as a &quot;farrago of lies&quot; in his 1981 memoirs, entitled &quot;Felicia&quot;.

From May 1980 to early 1981 he acted as editor for the magazine POL. In 1982, he moved to the neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states&#x27; traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria&#x27;s offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.

He was the national president of the &quot;Freedom from Hunger Campaign&quot; (1982–87), president of the &quot;Movement for Democracy in Fiji&quot; (from 1987), and national chairman of Community Aid Abroad (1992–93). Dunstan was an adjunct professor at the University of Adelaide from 1997 to 1999 and portrayed himself in the 1989 Australian independent film &quot;Against the Innocent&quot;.

In his retirement, Dunstan continued to be a passionate critic of economic rationalism (neoliberalism) and privatisation, particularly of South Australia&#x27;s water, gas and electricity supplies. During the 1990s he wrote essays for the &quot;Adelaide Review&quot; magazine strongly criticising the Federal Labor Governments of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, the Federal Liberal Government of John Howard and the State Liberal Governments of Dean Brown and John Olsen. He remained an advocate for multiculturalism and cultural diversity, often writing about the dangers of racism. A year before his death, the ailing Dunstan decried Labor&#x27;s economic rationalism in front of 5,000 at the Gough Whitlam Lecture. Regardless of the acclaim in which he was held during his decade in power, Dunstan was largely overlooked for honours after leaving office and largely ignored by the state&#x27;s elite. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in June 1979, and his former seat of Norwood was renamed Dunstan after him. The Dunstan Playhouse was later named to honour his contribution to the performing arts.

==Personal life==
Whilst living in Norwood and studying at university, Dunstan met his first wife, Gretel Elsasser, whose Jewish family had fled Nazi Germany to Australia. They married in 1949, and moved to Fiji. They returned to Adelaide in 1951 and settled in George Street, Norwood, with their young daughter, Bronwen. The family was forced to live in squalor for a number of years while Dunstan established his legal practice; during this time, they took in boarders as a source of extra income. Gretel later gave birth to two sons, Andrew and Paul.

In 1972, Dunstan separated from his wife and moved into a small flat in Kent Town, adjacent to Norwood. The family home was sold as two of the children were already studying in university. In 1974, the couple were finally divorced. Dunstan notes this period as being initially a &quot;very bleak and lonely&quot; time for him. In absence of his family, he made new friends and acquaintances. Friends living nearby would come to his apartment for conversation and good foodcooking was Dunstan&#x27;s hobby. Dunstan bought another house in 1974, partially financed from a then-unpublished cookbook. In 1976, &quot;Don Dunstan&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; was publishedthe first cookbook released by a serving Australian leader. More generally, Dunstan promoted a revolution in fine dining in the state. Encouraged by Dunstan&#x27;s enthusiasm for multiculturalism, many new restaurants were opened by proprietors and the diversity of cuisine increased. He also promoted the viticulture industry through his patronage of wine festivals.

In 1973, Adele Koh, a Malaysian journalist formerly living in Singapore, was appointed to work for Dunstan. She had been expelled by the Singaporean Government of Lee Kuan Yew for criticising its policies. The newspaper she had been working for, the &quot;Singapore Herald&quot;, was shut down by the government and she then moved to Australia. The two began a relationship in 1974, and married in 1976 in a small ceremony at Dunstan&#x27;s residence. Dunstan was much older than Adele, who was in her 30s. She was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in May 1978, and died in October after Dunstan had cared for her at her bedside for months. Her death seriously affected him and his own health began to suffer.

Although Dunstan never publicly commented on his sexuality, it has been said that he &quot;lived as a sexually liberated bisexual man&quot;. In 1986, he met his future partner, Steven Cheng, a post-graduate science student then in his twenties. Together, they opened a restaurant called &quot;Don&#x27;s Table&quot; in 1994. He lived with Cheng in their Norwood home for the rest of his life. Cheng nursed Dunstan through lung cancer until his death, and Dunstan bequeathed their home to Cheng for life.

==Death==
In 1993, Dunstan was diagnosed with an aggressive throat cancer and then an inoperable lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. Dunstan was not a smoker but was long exposed to passive smoking. A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the Adelaide Festival Centre as a tribute to Dunstan&#x27;s love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, Premier John Olsen, and State Opposition Leader Mike Rann. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in Elder Park along the banks of the River Torrens. State flags were flown at half-mast and the memorial service was televised live.

==Legacy==
A theatre in the Festival Centre was renamed the Dunstan Playhouse.

The Electoral Commission of South Australia&#x27;s 2012 redistribution included renaming the seat of Norwood to Dunstan which came into existence as of the 2014 election. In 2014 a biography &quot;Don Dunstan Intimacy &amp; Liberty&quot; by Dino Hodge, written with the co-operation of Dunstan&#x27;s family and former lovers, was published.

In 1988, Dunstan donated a collection of files pertaining to his political, professional and personal life; photographs; press clippings; speeches and press releases; audiovisual material; books from his library; some items of clothing; and other memorabilia to Flinders University Library, where it can be viewed and accessed for research purposes (see External links).

===Don Dunstan Foundation===
The Don Dunstan Foundation was established by Dunstan at the University of Adelaide in 1999, shortly before his death, to push for progressive change and to honour Dunstan&#x27;s memory. Dunstan had spent his last months helping to lay the platform for its establishment. At the inauguration of the body Dunstan had said, &quot;What we need is a concentration on the kind of agenda which I followed and I hope that my death will be useful in this.&quot;

The Foundation aims to represent and advocate for the values of its founder, such as cultural diversity, fair distribution of wealth, human rights advocacy, and Indigenous rights in Australia. Among other initiatives, it runs a series of annual events, such as a conference on homelessness, the IPAA Don Dunstan Oration, the Hugo Lecture, AdMental, Southgate Oration, and Human Rights Oration. The Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue Oration has been held annually since 2007, with a series of speakers illuminating aspects of Indigenous Australians&#x27; past and future in Australian society. It is held each year in Reconciliation Week. Orators have been chosen by O&#x27;Donoghue, until her death in February 2024.

On 3 June 2020, Jane Lomax-Smith was announced as new chair of the organisation, taking over from Lynn Arnold, who had held the position for 10 years and remains on the Board as Director and Patron as of June 2022.

===Don Dunstan Award===

Since its commencement in 2003, the Adelaide Film Festival has presented The Don Dunstan Award in recognition of outstanding contribution by an individual to the Australian film industry. Deemed by the Adelaide Film Festival&#x27;s Board to have &quot;enriched Australian screen culture through their work&quot;, its recipients include David Gulpilil, Rolf de Heer, and Scott Hicks. After receiving the award in 2013, Hicks acknowledged Dunstan&#x27;s vision for the creation of a film industry in South Australia as being instrumental to his professional development.

<text>Maxthon (, formerly named &quot;MyIE2&quot;) is a freeware web browser, created by JeffChen in Singapore. It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and as &quot;Maxthon Mobile&quot; for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8. Since version 6, Maxthon is based on Chromium.

==Overview==
Maxthon is a Hong Kong company known mainly for producing web browsers for Windows. It is headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, and San Francisco, US. Most of Maxthon&#x27;s team work remotely around the world, which develops and maintains versions of the Maxthon browser for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

Maxthon has also created other products including a Chinese language news and information portal &quot;i.maxthon.cn&quot;, a Chinese language casual gaming portal and humor website, a ‘Kid Safe’ web browser for Android and iOS, a free online account system named &quot;Maxthon Passport&quot;, and an English language news and information web portal i.maxthon.com.

==Corporate history==
In 2002, current CEO Ming Jie &quot;Jeff&quot; Chen () created MyIE2 browser based on open source product MyIE., in Singapore, and renamed to &quot;Maxthon&quot; in 2003. In 2005, the team received seed funding from venture capital firm WI Harper Group and Morten Lund, the first Skype investor, and Chen moved the company to Beijing. In 2006, Maxthon received further investment from the US-based venture capital firm Charles River Ventures.

Maxthon was one of the twelve browsers Microsoft presented in 2010 at BrowserChoice.eu, a website allowing users of Windows residing in the European Economic Area to choose which default web browser to use on their computer. In late 2010, Maxthon began releasing new compatibilities, including browsers for Android Mac, iPhone and iPad. As of August 2012, Maxthon is still in the first tier of browsers in BrowserChoice.eu after the removal of Apple Safari. The Maxthon Cloud Browser was released on December 10, 2012.

== Investment from Google ==

On April 10, 2007, &quot;TechCrunch&quot; reported that Google had invested at least US$1 million in Maxthon; this was denied the following day by Chen. However, in an interview with the Chinese web portal Sina.com, Chen did not rule out future &quot;cooperation&quot; between the two businesses.

== Awards ==
Maxthon Browser has received several awards and recognitions over the years for its innovative features and user-friendly interface. Some of the awards and recognitions include:

* WebWare 100 Winner: Maxthon was selected as one of the top 100 web applications by WebWare 2009, a CNET site.
* About.com Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards (2009, 2011,2014): Maxthon was voted as the Best Alternative Browser by the readers of About.com in both 2009, 2011 and 2014.
* Red Herring 100 Asia (2013): Maxthon was included in the Red Herring 100 Asia list, recognising the most promising private technology ventures from the Asian business region.
* PCWorld&#x27;s 100 Best Products of 2011: Maxthon was ranked among the top 100 products by PCWorld magazine in 2011.
* Global Mobile Internet Conference (2012): Maxthon Mobile was awarded the Best Mobile Browser at the Global Mobile Internet Conference held in Beijing, China.
These awards showcase Maxthon Browser&#x27;s commitment to innovation and user experience, even though it has not reached the same market share as some other major browsers.

===Data privacy issues===
In 2016, computer security researchers from &quot;Fidelis Cybersecurity&quot; and &quot;Exatel&quot; discovered the browser surreptitiously sending sensitive browsing and system data, such as ad blocker status, websites visited, searches conducted, and applications installed with their version numbers, to remote servers located in Beijing, China. According to Maxthon, the data is sent as part of the firm&#x27;s &#x27;User Experience Improvement Program&#x27; and it is &quot;voluntary and totally anonymous.&quot; However, researchers found the data still being collected and sent to remote servers even after users explicitly opt out of the program. The researchers further found the data being sent over an unencrypted connection (HTTP), leaving users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Fidelis&#x27; Chief Security Officer, Justin Harvey, noted the data &quot;contains almost everything you would want in conducting a reconnaissance operation to know exactly where to attack. Knowing the exact operating system and installed applications, and browsing habits it would be trivial to send a perfectly crafted spear phish to the victim or perhaps set up a watering hole attack on one of their most frequented websites.&quot; Maxthon CEO Jeff Chen claimed that this was due to a bug that was fixed as soon as Maxthon was made aware of the issue; however, Exatel had notified Maxthon of the issue without getting any response. 
The issue was found in Maxthon version 4.4.5. According to Maxthon, it was fixed in later version and no such issue was reported since then.

==Software==
===Development history===
According to Maxthon International CEO Ming Jie &quot;Jeff&quot; Chen, Maxthon was based on MyIE, a popular modification created by Chinese programmer Changyou to customize Internet Explorer web browser. Changyou posted most of the source code for MyIE on his Bulletin board system before leaving the project in 2000. Chen then continued independently developing MyIE and in 2002 released a new version, MyIE2. Users around the world were quite active in contributing to MyIE2&#x27;s development, adding many plug-ins, skins and assisting with debugging. MyIE2 was renamed Maxthon in 2003.

Maxthon 2 was introduced in July 2007, and Maxthon 3 was released in September 2010. Later that year, Maxthon began introducing browsers for portable devices. In December, Maxthon for Android was released. On July 7, 2012, Maxthon for Mac was released, with Maxthon for iPhone and iPad released in August 2012. On December 10, 2012, Maxthon Cloud Browser, also named Maxthon 4, was released.

===Features===
Maxthon 5 introduced these features:

* &quot;UUMail:&quot; enhances the email experience by creating unlimited virtual email IDs to keep the real email address safe and filtering out spams to make sure the inbox stays clean and organized.
* &quot;Maxnote:&quot; the original &#x27;Favorites&#x27; feature upgraded to &#x27;Maxnote&#x27;. Users can collect everything, read anywhere, and record anytime.

Synced users passwords to the Cloud and then accessed on all different platforms &amp; allows people to add and edit &quot;Accounts&quot; and &quot;Private Notes&quot;. It also helps users to auto-generate random complicated passwords when registering on a website so there&#x27;s no need to worry about passwords being cracked anymore.

==Browser versions==
===Version 1.x===
Maxthon version 1, which continued version 0 of MyIE2, was an Internet Explorer shell that implemented a tabbed browser using the Trident web browser engine which Microsoft introduced with Internet Explorer 4. As such, version 1 was compatible with every version of Windows from Windows 95 to Windows 7. Development of version 1 stopped in 2010 with the so-called Maxthon (Classic), version 1.6.7.35; earlier releases are available from Maxthon, and version 1.6.7.35, which fixed a bug in selecting the default search engine, is still available at other download sites.

There are many add-ons available for Maxthon Classic, and more are available through discussion forums. Specific threads may provide direct download links also. Some add-ons are build-specific, but in that case, a clear indication of compatibility can often be found.

<doc id="543850" wikidata="Q575258" url="?curid=543850" title="Antigenic drift">
<text>Antigenic drift is a kind of genetic variation in viruses, arising from the accumulation of mutations in the virus genes that code for virus-surface proteins that host antibodies recognize. This results in a new strain of virus particles that is not effectively inhibited by the antibodies that prevented infection by previous strains. This makes it easier for the changed virus to spread throughout a partially immune population. Antigenic drift occurs in both and viruses.

(Confusion can arise with two very similar terms, antigenic shift and genetic drift. Antigenic shift is a closely related process; it refers to the more dramatic changes in the virus&#x27;s surface proteins when the genetic material from two or more viruses mix together. Genetic drift is very different and much more broadly applicable; it refers to the gradual accumulation in any DNA sequence of random mutational changes that do not interfere with the DNA&#x27;s function and thus that are not seen by natural selection.)

The immune system recognizes viruses when antigens on the surfaces of virus particles bind to immune receptors that are specific for these antigens. These receptors can be antibodies in the bloodstream or similar proteins on the surfaces of immune-system cells. This recognition is quite precise, like a key recognizing a lock. After an infection or after vaccination, the body produces many more of these virus-specific immune receptors, which prevent re-infection by this particular strain of the virus; this is called acquired immunity. However, viral genomes are constantly mutating, producing new forms of these antigens. If one of these new forms of an antigen is sufficiently different from the old antigen, it will no longer bind to the antibodies or immune-cell receptors, allowing the mutant virus to infect people who were immune to the original strain of the virus because of prior infection or vaccination.

In 1940s, Maurice Hilleman discovered antigenic drift, which is the most common way that influenza viruses change. A second type of change is antigenic shift, also discovered by Hilleman, where the virus acquires a completely new version of one of its surface-protein genes from a distantly related influenza virus. The rate of antigenic drift is dependent on two characteristics: the duration of the epidemic, and the strength of host immunity. A longer epidemic allows for selection pressure to continue over an extended period of time and stronger host immune responses increase selection pressure for development of novel antigens.

== In influenza viruses ==
In the influenza virus, the two relevant antigens are the surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The hemagglutinin is responsible for binding and entry into host epithelial cells while the neuraminidase is involved in the process of new virions budding out of host cells. Sites recognized on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins by host immune systems are under constant selective pressure. Antigenic drift allows for evasion of these host immune systems by small mutations in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes that make the protein unrecognizable to pre-existing host immunity. Antigenic drift is this continuous process of genetic and antigenic change among flu strains.

In human populations, immune (vaccinated) individuals exert selective pressure for single point mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that increase receptor binding avidity, while naive individuals exert selective pressure for single point mutations that decrease receptor binding avidity. These dynamic selection pressures facilitate the observed rapid evolution in the hemagglutinin gene. Specifically, 18 specific codons in the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene have been identified as undergoing positive selection to change their encoded amino acid. To meet the challenge of antigenic drift, vaccines that confer broad protection against heterovariant strains are needed against seasonal, epidemic and pandemic influenza.

As in all RNA viruses, mutations in influenza occur frequently because the virus&#x27; RNA polymerase has no proofreading mechanism, resulting in an error rate between and substitutions per site per year during viral genome replication. Mutations in the surface proteins allow the virus to elude some host immunity, and the numbers and locations of these mutations that confer the greatest amount of immune escape has been an important topic of study for over a decade.

Antigenic drift has been responsible for heavier-than-normal flu seasons in the past, like the outbreak of influenza H3N2 variant A/Fujian/411/2002 in the 2003–2004 flu season. All influenza viruses experience some form of antigenic drift, but it is most pronounced in the influenza A virus.

Antigenic drift should not be confused with antigenic shift, which refers to reassortment of the virus&#x27; gene segments.
As well, it is different from random genetic drift, which is an important mechanism in population genetics.

<doc id="543851" wikidata="Q1755611" url="?curid=543851" title="Aenictogiton">
<text>Aenictogiton is a genus of ants, comprising seven rarely collected species. All the species are known only from males found in Central Africa, and show a morphological and phylogenetic affinity to the army ant genus &quot;Dorylus&quot;. The dorylomorph ants include six subfamilies– Aenictogitoninae, Cerapachyinae, Leptanilloidinae, and the three army ant subfamilies Aenictinae, Dorylinae and Ecitoninae.

== Origin ==
Army ants predominantly reside in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Indo-Australia, however, a few species range into more temperate regions. The Ecitoninae all reside in the New World with an exception to two army ant subfamilies that are located in the Old World. Most of the species are located in Oriental and Indo-Australian regions and a small variety in the Afrotropical region.

== Behavioral and Reproductive Traits ==
All species within the three army ant subfamilies have similar behavioral and reproductive traits such as, obligate collective foraging, nomadism, and highly modified queens called dichthadiigynes. Aenictogiton or army ants never forage or hunt alone, they instead use leaderless, co-operative mass of ants to overwhelm their prey all at once. The army ants never reside in one location and do not build permanent nests. Therefore, they forage and hunt in different locations and emigrate periodically. The Queen are wingless and contain expandable abdomens that allow them to produce millions of eggs per month, which allows variation to occur within the species.

<text>Charles Cameron Kingston (22 October 1850 – 11 May 1908) was an Australian politician. From 1893 to 1899 he was a radical liberal Premier of South Australia, occupying this office with the support of Labor, which in the House of Assembly was led by John McPherson from 1893, and by Lee Batchelor upon McPherson&#x27;s death in 1897.

Kingston won the 1893, 1896 and 1899 colonial elections against the conservatives. During his time as Premier, Kingston was responsible for such measures as electoral reform including the first law to give votes to women in Australia (and second in the world only to New Zealand), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration act in Australia, establishment of a state bank, a high protective tariff, regulation of factories, a progressive system of land, and income taxation, a public works program, and more extensive workers&#x27; compensation.

A leading advocate of federation, Kingston contributed extensively at a practical level to bringing it about. Elected to the House of Representatives with the most votes amongst the seven candidates in the single statewide Division of South Australia at the 1901 national election, he aligned himself with the Protectionist Party, going on to represent the Division of Adelaide at the election two years later.

He was also one of the main proponents of what was later termed the White Australia policy, arguing strongly against Chinese immigration. In his capacity as representative of South Australia — in 1888 he attended a conference in Sydney that proposed changes in the migration laws of the time.

==Early life==
Kingston was born in Adelaide on 22 October 1850. He was the youngest of six children born to Luduvina Catherina Da Silva () and George Strickland Kingston. His father, a widower who had re-married, was born in Ireland and trained as an architect and engineer in England. He was appointed deputy surveyor-general for the new Province of South Australia and arrived in 1836 on board the First Fleet. Kingston&#x27;s mother was the daughter of military officer Charles Cameron and his Portuguese-born wife Luduvina Rosa Da Silva, who married in 1812 during the Peninsular War. She later became the step-daughter of seaman and pastoralist John Finnis, following her father&#x27;s early death.

Kingston&#x27;s mother died in 1851 at the age of 27, after which he and his siblings were probably raised by servants as their father was heavily involved in business and political activities. In 1856 he married Emma Berry, the widowed daughter of harbourmaster Thomas Lipson, but had no further children. Kingston formed a close bond with his older brother Strickland. At an early age he was sent to John Lorenzo Young&#x27;s Adelaide Educational Institution, where he regularly won awards and had a talent for mathematics. His schoolmate Joseph Verco later recalled him as &quot;distinctly rough in manner and rather disposed to bully those younger and smaller than himself [...] very disposed to mischief, practical and horse-play&quot;. He left the school at the end of 1867 and decided to study law, beginning his articles of clerkship in March 1868 with future attorney-general Samuel Way.

Kingston was called to the bar in 1873, despite the objection of the elder brother of his future wife, Lucy May McCarthy on the grounds of Kingston&#x27;s alleged seduction of her. He became a QC in 1889.
In 1873 Kingston married Lucy McCarthy, who was disabled for much of her life. They had no children, but in a remarkable gesture, Lucy took in a child, Kevin Kingston, whom Kingston had fathered with another woman, Elizabeth Watson, in 1883. As a result of the scandal, Kingston was ostracised by Adelaide &quot;society&quot;, his contempt for whom he never troubled to conceal. Kevin died in 1902.

Kingston and his older brother Strickland Gough &quot;Pat&quot; Kingston (1848 – 3 October 1897) formed a business partnership Kingston &amp; Kingston in 1879 which they dissolved in July 1884. S. G. Kingston was a brilliant lawyer but unstable. He was jailed for the gunshot wounding of a cabdriver in June 1884 and killed himself after losing an important case in Port Augusta.

Kingston had a passion for Australian rules football in South Australia and helped formulate its code and was president of the South Adelaide Football Club and chief patron of both South Adelaide football and cricket clubs.

==Colonial politics==

In April 1881, Kingston was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as a radical liberal for the seat of West Adelaide. He favoured reform of the Legislative Council (which was dominated by wealthy landowners) and other radical reforms. He was described by William Maloney as the originator of the White Australia policy; he was opposed to Chinese immigration, and was very involved in crafting the framework for regulating it.

Kingston was Attorney-General of South Australia from 1884 to 1885 in the government of John Colton and again in 1887–89 in the government of Tom Playford. In 1893, he succeeded Playford as leader of the South Australian liberals and defeated the conservative premier, John Downer, to become premier from 1893 to 1899, a record at the time of six-and-a-half years, not to be broken until Thomas Playford IV. Kingston was also Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Minister for Industry from 1895 to 1899. He came to office with the support of a new third party, the South Australian division of the Labor Party, led by John McPherson, which held the balance of power.

A big, imposing man with a full beard, a booming voice and a violent, cutting debating style, Kingston dominated the small world of South Australian colonial politics in the 1890s. He was a great hero to liberals and working-class voters and much hated by conservatives. In 1892, Richard Baker called him a &quot;coward, a bully and a disgrace to the legal profession&quot; in the Legislative Council and Kingston replied by calling Baker &quot;false as a friend, treacherous as a colleague, mendacious as a man, and utterly untrustworthy in every relationship of public life&quot;. Kingston arranged for a duel but Baker had him arrested. Kingston was thus bound over to keep the peace for a year.

Kingston did not support votes for women at the 1893 elections but was subsequently persuaded by his ministerial colleagues, John Cockburn and Frederick Holder of its political advantages, and was lobbied by the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. Women&#x27;s suffrage in Australia took a leap forward, with the &quot;Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act 1894&quot; enacted in 1894 and taking effect from following year&#x27;s election.

Kingston&#x27;s government also established the State Bank of South Australia, regulated factories, imposed death duties, and increased land tax and progressive income taxes.

When Tom Buxton was appointed Governor of South Australia, Kingston was angry that the government had not been involved in the decision and so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor&#x27;s allowance was reduced, and customs duty was charged on its household items (including his wife&#x27;s invalid carriage).

A leading supporter of Federation, Kingston was a delegate to the Constitutional Conventions of 1891 and 1897 to 1898 which worked to draft an Australian Constitution. In 1897, he travelled to London for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, where he was made a Privy Councillor and awarded an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws degree by Oxford University. He also turned down the offer of a knighthood, to the distress of his wife. He lobbied senior British politicians in favour of Australian federation.

In 1899, Kingston&#x27;s government was defeated in the House on a bill sponsored by an anti-Federationist, but relating to the reform of the Legislative Council, and Kingston resigned as Premier. By then, however, he was more interested in federal politics, as the six Australian colonies moved towards federation. He was a leading figure in the popular movement for federation, and in 1900, he travelled to London with Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin to oversee the passage of the federation bill through the Parliament of the United Kingdom. While in London he won only 28 percent of votes in a contest to represent the Southern District in the Legislative Council of South Australia, but in September 1900 won 52 percent of votes for the Council&#x27;s Central district. The establishment of the new Commonwealth of Australia, however, now loomed over events.

The Liberal and Democratic Union was not formed until the 1906 election.

==Federal politics==

When the Constitution came into effect on 1 January 1901, Barton formed the first federal ministry, and Kingston was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs. In March 1901, he was elected as one of seven statewide members of the Division of South Australia in the first Australian House of Representatives. Kingston topped the poll, with 65% of the vote; South Australia was not divided into electoral divisions in time for that election. In 1903, he became the first member for the Division of Adelaide. His Central District seat in the Legislative Council was won by George Brookman.

Kingston was a &quot;high protectionist&quot; and favoured very high tariffs to protect Australia&#x27;s fledgling manufacturing industries. Most of his time as minister was spent negotiating a customs bill through both houses of the Parliament since no party had a majority in either house, and the forces of the Free Trade Party resisted his bill at every stage. Negotiating with his opponents was not among Kingston&#x27;s many talents, and his bullying style made him many enemies. He also insisted on involving himself in the administrative details of his department and insisted on prosecutions of businesses to enforce his high-tariff policies.

In July 1903, Kingston resigned suddenly in a fit of anger from the opposition of John Forrest and Edmund Barton to his attempt to impose conciliation and arbitration on British and foreign seamen engaged in the Australian coastal trade.

===Final years===
By the time of his resignation from cabinet, Kingston&#x27;s health was poor and he was struggling to carry out his departmental duties. Due to financial difficulties he soon returned to his legal practice. He was re-elected unopposed at the 1903 federal election and made his final parliamentary speech in March 1904, which left him exhausted; a month later he was admitted to a private hospital in Melbourne. Following the collapse of Deakin&#x27;s government, Kingston was offered a place in the new ministry formed by ALP leader Chris Watson. He reluctantly declined on medical advice.

From 1904, Kingston was frequently absent from the House for medical reasons, but was nonetheless re-elected unopposed at the 1906 election. He was nursed by his wife Lucy at their home south of Adelaide, with visitors including John Langdon Bonython noting his obvious mental decline. Lucy was also in poor health and became the subject of derision in society circles following an incident with Jenkin Coles, where she reportedly &quot;set the dogs on him and chased him away, menacing him with a broomstick&quot;.

Kingston died in Adelaide on 11 May 1908 following a stroke the previous day, less than a week after the death of his older sister Ludovina. Federal parliament was sitting at the time and adjourned for the day in his honour. A state funeral was held on 13 May and was &quot;one of the largest ever seen in South Australia&quot;, with Deakin in attendance. He was buried at the local West Terrace Cemetery, survived by his wife who died in 1919. He left an estate valued at £50 following the payment of debts, excluding two properties held in his wife&#x27;s name.

==Exhumation==
Kingston&#x27;s body was exhumed in March 2008, nearly 100 years after his death because two people thought they may be his direct descendants from one of his illegitimate children. It is claimed that Kingston was ostracised by Adelaide society for his sexual orientation &amp; indiscretions and that he fathered at least six illegitimate children.

==Statue==
A statue of Kingston stands in Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga, in the centre of Adelaide, with the plaque reading &quot;patriot and statesman&quot;. After the Black Lives Matter gained pace in June 2020, with various statues representing slave traders and various perpetrators of racism being removed or defaced both in the US and in the UK during the George Floyd protests, archaeologist and historian Jacinta Koolmatrie pointed out what she saw as the irony of the statue being so close to the Aboriginal flag in the square, which was also the site of the Adelaide Black Lives Matter protest.

<text>The šajkača (, ) is the Serbian national hat or cap. Traditionally worn by men in the Serbian countryside, it is named after Serb river troops known as &quot;šajkaši&quot;. A popular national symbol in Serbia since the beginning of the 20th century, it is typically black, grey or green in colour and is usually made of soft, homemade cloth. It became widely worn by Serb men beginning in the 1880s and was a key component in the uniform of the Serbian military from the end of the 19th century. Today, it is mostly worn by elderly men in rural communities.

==History==

The &quot;šajkača&quot; is believed to have originated in the Serbian region of Banat during the 18th century, when &quot;šajkaši&quot; (Serb river troops in the service of the Austrian Empire) guarded the Danube and Sava rivers against the Ottoman Empire and wore caps in the shape of an overturned &quot;chaika&quot; () boat.

Through most of the 19th century, the fez was the dominant choice of headwear for both Muslims and Christians in the Balkans, and fezzes were frequently emblazoned with national or religious symbols. In Serbia, for example, regulations for ministerial uniforms from 1850 required the Serbian coat of arms be featured on officials&#x27; red fezzes. It was not until the decade following the Serbian-Ottoman Wars of 1876–1878 that the šajkača began to overtake the fez in popularity among Serbs and thus very few paintings or photographs exist featuring the šajkača in use prior to the early 20th century. 

The typical cap of peasants from the Šumadija region of Serbia, the &quot;šajkača&quot; eventually acquired a dual purpose: it was worn by civilians in the countryside, and it became part of the standard Serbian military uniform other than in full dress. During World War I, the cap was regularly worn by the soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia. Serbia was eventually overrun by a combined Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian invasion in 1915, and in 1916 the wearing of the &quot;šajkača&quot;, alongside other Serbian folk attire, was outlawed by Bulgarian authorities in the wake of the Bulgarian occupation of southern Serbia.

During World War II, the &quot;šajkača&quot; was the standard hat worn by Serbian Chetnik irregulars in the Axis-occupied Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was also worn by Serbian Partisans. After the war, it was replaced by the &quot;Titovka&quot; cap in the armed forces of communist Yugoslavia.

The &quot;šajkača&quot; was worn by Serb soldiers during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Bosnian Serb reservists and paramilitaries wore the cap during the 1992–95 Bosnian War, and it was later adopted by Bosnian Serb forces to be the official headgear of the Army of Republika Srpska (, VRS). Following the 1991 Battle of Vukovar, fought during the Croatian War of Independence, Croatian Serb authorities erected gravestones to the Serb soldiers who were killed fighting for the city. These were originally topped with sculptural evocations of the &quot;šajkača&quot; cap. After Vukovar&#x27;s reintegration into Croatia the gravestones were repeatedly vandalized, leading the Serb community in the town to replace them with more neutral gravestones without any overt military connotations. The 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia saw McDonald&#x27;s chains in Serbia promote their products by distributing posters and lapels which depicted the &quot;šajkača&quot; standing atop the golden arches of the McDonald&#x27;s logo in an attempt to bolster Serbian national pride.

The &quot;šajkača&quot; has been a popular national symbol in Serbia since the beginning of the 20th century. It is commonly worn by elderly men in the Serbian countryside, whereas Serbian youth wear traditional costumes only for folklore concerts.

==Design==
Designed with a V-shaped top in the form of an overturned &quot;chaika&quot;, the &quot;šajkača&quot; is narrow and typically black or grey in colour. It is usually made of soft, homemade cloth and is worn without any symbols during peacetime. During times of war, cockades featuring the Serbian double-headed eagle and the motto &quot;Only Unity Saves the Serbs&quot; are often seen on the cap. The &quot;šajkača&quot; worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non-reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram.

<text>The Movement Action Plan is a strategic model for waging nonviolent social movements developed by Bill Moyer, a US social change activist. The MAP, initially developed by Moyer in the late 1970s, uses case studies of successful social movements to illustrate eight distinct stages through social movements&#x27; progress, and is designed to help movement activists choose the most effective tactics and strategies to match their movements&#x27; current stage.

==The eight stages==
Moyer describes the eight stages as:
# Critical social problem exists
# Prove failure of official institutions
# Ripening conditions
# Take off
# Perception of failure 
# Majority public opinion
# Success
# Continuation

<text>Gary Lee Shipman (born March 16, 1966) is an American artist, comic book illustrator and writer of &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot;. He is father to three children.

==Biography==
Shipman grew up in Salinas, California and is a self-taught artist. His interest in comics and art first began at a young age, while in the sixth grade.

Shipman, with wife Rhoda Shipman, first created the independently produced comic book series &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; in 1995, both plotting out the stories together and Gary scripting, lettering, penciling, and inking the illustrations for the series. &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; tells the adventuresome and engaging tale of Paul, a young boy who finds himself in a magical world filled with talking animals, mystery and excitement. &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; has been heralded for excellence by both critics and peers alike, accumulating an international following and numerous award nominations.

Certain characters in the &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; stories are named after Shipman&#x27;s children.

Shipman resides in Illinois with his family and, at times, makes appearances as a guest artist at comic conventions in the region.

Shipman has dyslexia and has shared about coping with it, at times, on his YouTube live streams.

In late 2013, a 46-page color collection of his artistry: &quot;The Gary Shipman Sketchbook Volume #1&quot;, was published by Lamp Post, Inc., released as both a perfect-bound paperback edition and also as a Kindle e-book.

In 2016, the &quot;Gary Shipman Sketchbook 2016&quot;, a 45-page paperback collection of Shipman&#x27;s artwork, was self-published and offered online.

In 2018, Shipman started a Patreon account and began regularly live streaming drawing sessions on his YouTube channel where he chats and interacts with fans from around the world.

In late 2018, &quot;Gary Shipman 2018 Sketchbook&quot;, A full-color 70 page collection of his art, was crowdfunded in an Indiegogo campaign. The campaign was fully funded in minutes and raised $8745.00 (411% funded). The campaign offered incentives such as original art, a republished &quot;Pakkins Land&quot; issue 1 &amp; 2, and collectible &quot;Pakkins Land&quot; trading cards.

== Other works ==

Shipman&#x27;s artistic talents can also be found elsewhere. In 1987, he co-created the superhero character Edge for Silverwolf Comics, and illustrated the first 3 issues of that series.

In 1997, Shipman illustrated the cover of Issue #19 of the comic series &quot;OZ&quot;, based on the books and characters of L. Frank Baum.

In 1998, Shipman illustrated the cover of &quot;Parables &amp; Proverbs&quot; published by New Creation Publications.

In 2003, Shipman illustrated &quot;Amazing True Life Stories&quot; Issue # 2: &quot;Spymaster&quot; for Crosswind Comics.

In 2008, Shipman illustrated &quot;Kingdoms: A Biblical Epic, Vol. 4 - Valley of Dry Bones&quot;, and &quot;Kingdoms: A Biblical Epic, Vol. 5 - The Writing on the Wall&quot;.

In 2011, Shipman was invited to join the DreamWorks Animation Fine Art program, with his first offering being an interpretative piece based on &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, made available as the original painting or as prints.

In 2012, Shipman was one of 80 different contributing writers and artists from around the globe for the third and final book in the &quot;Fables for Japan&quot; digital anthology to benefit the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

Released in 2013, Shipman was a contributing artist for both the DC Comics &quot;Batman: The Legend&quot; trading cards and the &quot;Superman: The Legend&quot; trading cards sets produced by Cryptozoic Entertainment.

Released in 2014, Shipman illustrated &quot;Fun with Kirk and Spock (Star Trek: A Parody)&quot; written by author Robb Pearlman.

Also in 2014, Shipman was a contributing artist for the Adventure Time trading cards set produced by Cryptozoic Entertainment.

In 2014, Shipman started to see his artwork distributed by art distributor Acme Archives, doing licensed pieces in his distinctive style from Disney, Marvel Entertainment, and Lucasfilm

In 2015, Shipman illustrated a label for the Rot Berry (strawberry) flavor of Deadworld Zombie Soda, and the associated trading card series.

In 2018, Shipman was a contributing artist to the Rick and Morty trading cards season 1 set produced by Cryptozoic Entertainment.

<text>Generative music is a term popularized by Brian Eno to describe music that is ever-different and changing, and that is created by a system.

== Historical background ==

In 1995 whilst working with SSEYO&#x27;s Koan software (built by Tim Cole and Pete Cole who later evolved it to Noatikl then Wotja), Brian Eno used the term &quot;generative music&quot; to describe any music that is ever-different and changing, created by a system. The term has since gone on to be used to refer to a wide range of music, from entirely random music mixes created by multiple simultaneous CD playback, through to live rule-based computer composition.

Koan was SSEYO&#x27;s first real-time music generation system, developed for the Windows platform. Work on Koan was started in 1990, and the software was first released to the public in 1994. In 1995 Brian Eno started working with SSEYO&#x27;s Koan Pro software, work which led to the 1996 publication of his title &#x27;Generative Music 1 with SSEYO Koan Software&#x27;.

Eno&#x27;s early relationship with SSEYO Koan and Intermorphic co-founder Tim Cole was captured and published in his 1995 diary A Year with Swollen Appendices.

== Theory ==
There are four primary perspectives on generative music (Wooller, R. et al., 2005) (reproduced with permission):

===Linguistic/structural===
Music composed from analytic theories that are so explicit as to be able to generate structurally coherent material (Loy and Abbott 1985; Cope 1991). This perspective has its roots in the generative grammars of language (Chomsky 1956) and music (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983), which generate material with a recursive tree structure.

===Interactive/behavioural===
Music generated by a system component that has no discernible musical inputs. That is, &quot;not transformational&quot; (Rowe 1991; Lippe 1997:34; Winkler 1998). The Wotja software by Intermorphic, and the Koan software by SSEYO used by Brian Eno to create &quot;Generative Music 1&quot;, are both examples of this approach.

===Creative/procedural===
Music generated by processes that are designed and/or initiated by the composer. Steve Reich&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; and Terry Riley&#x27;s &quot;In C&quot; are examples of this (Eno 1996).

===Biological/emergent===
Non-deterministic music (Biles 2002), or music that cannot be repeated, for example, ordinary wind chimes (Dorin 2001). This perspective comes from the broader generative art movement. This revolves around the idea that music, or sounds may be &quot;generated&quot; by a musician &quot;farming&quot; parameters within an ecology, such that the ecology will perpetually produce different variation based on the parameters and algorithms used. An example of this technique is Joseph Nechvatal&#x27;s Viral symphOny: a collaborative electronic noise music symphony created between the years 2006 and 2008 using custom artificial life software based on a viral model.

<doc id="543887" wikidata="Q26303" url="?curid=543887" title="Ultramarathon">
<text>An ultramarathon is a footrace longer than the traditional marathon distance of . The sport of running ultramarathons is called ultra running or ultra distance running.

Various distances, surfaces, and formats are raced competitively, from the shortest common ultramarathon of and up to 3100 miles. Around is typically the longest course distance raced in under 24 hours, but there are also longer multiday races commonly held as 48 hours, , or more, sometimes raced in stages with breaks for sleep.

The oldest and largest ultramarathons are on road, including the Comrades Marathon (over 10,000 finishers annually) and Two Oceans Marathon (over 6,000 finishers annually). The world&#x27;s longest certified footrace is the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race. Many ultras have historical significance, including the Spartathlon, based on the 246 km run of Greek messenger Pheidippides from Athens to Sparta during the Battle of Marathon in a day and a half to seek aid against the Persians.

Ultra running World Championships are held by the International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) for 50 km, 100 km and 24 hours. The Global Organization of Multi-Day Ultramarathoners (GOMU) holds World Championships for 48 hours and six days. World records are ratified and recognized by World Athletics (50 km and 100 km), the IAU (50 km up to six days), and by GOMU (48 hours up to 5000 km).

There is also overlap with the sports of trail running and mountain running. Some races are among the oldest and most prestigious events, especially in North America. The oldest and also the largest trail race is the SainteLyon in France (over 5,000 finishers annually). Many ultramarathon organizers are members of the International Trail Running Association (ITRA), an organization that evaluates the difficulty of specific ultramarathon routes according to a number of criteria, such as the distance, the cumulative elevation gain, and the number of loops and stages.

==Overview==
There are two main types of ultramarathon events: those that cover a specified distance or route, and those that last for a predetermined period (with the winner covering the most distance in that time). The most common distances are , 50 miles (80.47 km), , , and continue up to the longest certified race distance of 3100 miles. Timed events range from 6, 12, and 24 hours to 3, 6, and 10 days (known as Multiday races). Timed events are generally run on a track or a short road course, often one mile (1.6 km) or less.

The format of ultramarathons and the courses vary, ranging from single loops (some as short as a track), to point-to-point road or trail races, to cross-country rogaines. Many ultramarathons have significant obstacles, such as inclement weather, elevation change, or rugged terrain. Usually, there are aid stations, whether every lap of a track, small road or trail loop courses, or extending up to perhaps , where runners can replenish food and drink supplies or take a short break.

There are some self-supported ultramarathon stage races in which each competitor has to carry all their supplies including food to survive the length of the race, typically a week long. The Marathon des Sables 6-day stage race in Morocco and the Grand to Grand Ultra in the US are examples.

The International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) organises the World Championships for various ultramarathon distances, including , , 24 hours, and ultra trail running, which are also recognized by World Athletics. Many countries around the world have their own ultrarunning organizations, often the national athletics federation of the country, or are sanctioned by such national athletics organizations.

50-kilometer and 100-kilometer races are recognized as World Records by World Athletics, the world governing body of track and field. The International Association of Ultrarunners recognizes IAU World Records for 50-kilometers, 100-kilometers, 6 hours, 12 hours, 100 miles, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 6 days.

There are ultramarathon racewalking events that are usually 50 km, although 100 km and 100-mile (160 km) &quot;Centurion&quot; races are also organized. Furthermore, the non-competitive International Marching League event Nijmegen Four Days March has a regulation distance of 4 × 50 km over four days for those aged 19 to 49.

In 2021, concerns were raised about planning and medical care available for ultramarathons in China, after dozens of racers died from hypothermia and at least one from a heart attack while competing in an ultramarathon in the Yellow River Stone Forest. The government later announced a ban on &quot;extreme&quot; competitions.

In August 2023, a partnership between Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) and Ironman Triathlon was announced and the new formation of the UTMB World Series, an ultra-distance circuit that culminates with UTMB held in August. Concerns have been raised about rising entry fees, homogenization of racing experiences, and bulldozing of smaller events.

==IAU World Record and World Best performances==
Until 2014, the IAU maintained lists of the world best performances on different surfaces (road, track, and indoor). Starting in 2015, the distinction between the surfaces was removed and the records were combined into a single category. Some governing bodies continue to keep separate ultramarathon track and road records for their jurisdictions.

Starting in January 2022, the IAU began to recognize and ratify performances as IAU World Records. World Athletics also began to ratify the 50k distance as a World Record for both mixed and women, respectively, along with 100k. The events considered IAU World Records are: 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours along with 50 and 100 miles. Records in the 6 day event are called World Best Performances by the IAU.

Performances exceeding the current IAU records but which have not yet been ratified include the following:

* Stine Rex ran 435.564 km at the 2024 GOMU 48 hour world championships. The GOMU lists it as a &quot;All Time World Best&quot; performance.
* Stine Rex ran 913.6 km at a 6-day race in Denmark during August and September 2024.
* Courtney Olsen ran 50 miles in 5:31:56 in November 2024 at the Tunnel Hill 50 Mile in the US.

The IAU World Records and World Best Performances as of January 2025 are as follows.

===Men===

===Women===
Until 2021, the IAU also kept records for 1000 km and 1000 miles. The final records were:

===Men===
===Women===
==IAU World Championships==
There are four IAU World Championships: the IAU 100 km World Championships, IAU 50 km World Championships, IAU 24 Hour World Championship, and the IAU Trail World Championships.

===Oceania, Australia, and New Zealand===
Australia and New Zealand are hosts to some 100 organized ultramarathons each year. Additionally, a handful of runners have run the entire length of New Zealand, a distance of around .

In Australia, the Westfield Ultra Marathon was an annual race between Sydney and Melbourne contested between 1983 and 1991. Greek runner Yiannis Kouros won the event five times during that period. Australia is also the home of one of the oldest six-day races in the world, the Cliff Young Australian 6-day race, held in Colac, Victoria. The race is held on a 400-meter circuit at the Memorial Square in the centre of Colac and has seen many close races since its inception in 1984. The 20th Cliff Young Australian six-day race was held between 20 and 26 November 2005. During that event, Kouros beat his existing world record six-day track mark and set a new mark of . The Coast to Kosciuszko inaugurated in 2004, is a marathon from the coast to the top of Mount Kosciuszko, Australia&#x27;s highest mountain.

Australia has seen a steep growth in ultrarunning events and participants in recent years. Many new races have come into inception, covering a range of ultramarathon distances from 50 km right through to multi-day events. The cornerstone of Australian Ultra events is such races as Ultra-Trail Australia 100, The Great North Walk Ultras, Surf Coast Century, Bogong to Hotham, Alpine Challenge, GC50 Run Festival, and the Cradle Mountain Run. The Australian Ultra Runners Association (AURA) has a comprehensive list and links of events and their respective results.

In New Zealand, the Kepler Challenge is held on a trail through Fiordland National Park. It has been running since 1988 and is one of the country&#x27;s most popular races. The Tarawera Ultramarathon is currently one of the most competitive ultras in New Zealand and part of the Ultra-Trail World Tour.

===Europe===
The European Ultramarathon Cup is an annual cup event covering some of the biggest ultramarathon races in Europe. The CajaMar Tenerife Bluetrail is the highest race in Spain and second highest in Europe. Besides trail ultramarathons, Europe features large road ultramarathons such as Spartathlon and the Millau 100K, which have gathered thousands of runners for the past 50 years.

The UTMB, through France, Italy, and Switzerland has been considered the world&#x27;s most competitive trail ultra. The other races in the UTMB festival, including the CCC, TDS, and OCC, are also significant events in the ultrarunning calendar.

===North America===
The oldest existing ultramarathon in North America is the JFK 50 Mile, which began in 1963 as a push by President John F. Kennedy to bring the country back to physical fitness.

There are several 100-mile ultramarathons held annually in North America. The Western States Endurance Run is the oldest 100-mile trail run in North America. The race began in 1977, founded by Wendell Robie, of Auburn California.

The first mountain trail ultramarathon held in the United States was the 1911 Mount Baker Race (50K), in Bellingham, Washington. Runners raced by car or train to the trailheads, ran up and down Mount Baker 10,000 feet, and then returned to the city.

An early ultramarathon was held in Mexico in 1926, and at the time was part of the Central American Games. Tomas Zafiro and Leoncio San Miguel, both Tarahumara Indians, ran 100 km from Pachuca to Mexico City in 9 hours and 37 minutes. At the time, the Mexican government petitioned to include a 100 km race in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.

In 1928, sports agent C. C. Pyle organized the first of two editions of the 3,455-mile-long Bunion Derby (the first went along U.S. Route 66 from Los Angeles to Chicago before heading toward New York; the 1929 Derby reversed the route). Neither the race nor the accompanying vaudeville show was a financial success.

In the 1980s, Gary &quot;Lazarus Lake&quot; Cantrell and Karl &quot;Raw Dog&quot; Henn conceived the Barkley Marathons, an annual trail race held in March or April in Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee. The course is approximately 20 miles long with approximately 11,000 feet of vertical climb, and runners have 60 hours to complete five laps. The run is notorious not only for its difficulty but also for its secretive nature; entrants must undergo a selection process and entry dates and requirements are not announced, meaning entrants rely on word-of-mouth for details on how to enter. The first Barkley Marathons took place in 1986, and as of 2022, only fifteen runners have ever completed the 100-mile course.

Since 1997, runners have been competing in the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race, which is billed as the longest official footrace in the world. They run 100 laps a day for up to 50 days around a single block in Queens, NY, for a total distance of . The current record holder is Ashprihanal Pekka Aalto, at 40 days 09:06:21 for a daily average of in 2015.

Several 10-day races are also regularly available in the US at venues that hold 6-day races: Across the Years (in Arizona), Sri Chinmoy (in New York) and 6 Days in the Dome (Wisconsin).

In April 2006, the American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame was established by the American Ultrarunning Association (AUA). Candidates for the Hall of Fame are chosen from the &#x27;modern era&#x27; of American ultras, beginning with the New York Road Runners Club 30 Mile race held in 1958. The Inaugural inductees were Ted Corbitt, a former US Olympian, winner of the aforementioned race in 3:04:13, and co-founder of the Road Runners Club of America, and Sandra Kiddy, who began her ultra career at age 42 with a world record at 50 kilometers, 3:36:56, and who went on to set a number of US and world ultra records.

The Yukon Arctic Ultra is described as the coldest and toughest ultra in the world, requiring racers to start from Whitehorse to Dawson City, Yukon, a distance of 430 miles (692 km) in 13 days under the territory&#x27;s extremely cold conditions in February.

<text>Solange Piaget Knowles (; born June 24, 1986) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Knowles expressed an interest in music from an early age and had temporary stints as a backup dancer for Destiny&#x27;s Child, which featured her older sister Beyoncé among its members, before signing with her father&#x27;s label, Music World Entertainment. At 16, Knowles released her first studio album &quot;Solo Star&quot; (2002). She also appeared in the films &quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot; (2004), and &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot; (2006).

In 2007, Knowles began to record music again. Heavily influenced by Motown girl groups, her second studio album &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot; (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to Motown-inspired sounds from the 1960s and 1970s. It peaked at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the 1980s pop and R&amp;B-inspired extended play &quot;True&quot; (2012) on Terrible Records and her imprint Saint Records. Her third studio album, &quot;A Seat at the Table&quot; (2016) was released to widespread critical acclaim and became her first number-one album in the United States. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Cranes in the Sky&quot; won the Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance. Her fourth studio album, &quot;When I Get Home&quot;, was released in March 2019 to further critical acclaim.

Knowles says that her first passion is songwriting. Frequently compared by the media to her sister Beyoncé, Knowles has claimed that they have different aspirations and are musically different. She has been ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the 100th most successful dance artist of all time, and in 2017 was honored with the &quot;Impact Award&quot; at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Women in Music event. Her other ventures include an endorsement deal with Rimmel London and a line of hip-hop-oriented merchandise for young children.

Knowles has also ventured into performance art, working in several international museums and exhibitions, such as the Elbphilharmonie, the Venice Art Biennale and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In 2022, Knowles became the third woman and first African American to compose a score for the New York City Ballet.

==Early life==
Solange Piaget Knowles was born on June 24, 1986, in Houston, Texas to Tina and Mathew Knowles. Her older sister is singer Beyoncé Knowles. Her father, originally from Alabama, is African American, and her mother, originally from Texas, is an African American of Louisiana Creole heritage. Her maternal grandparents are Lumis Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon, a seamstress. She is also a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. Knowles was raised Catholic until the age of four, when her family became members of a Methodist church. As a child, she studied dance and theater. At age five, she made her singing debut at Six Flags AstroWorld, a theme park in Houston. She began writing songs at the age of nine. At 13, she decided to pursue recording, but her parents initially advised her to wait. During Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s opening stint for Christina Aguilera&#x27;s 2000 tour, Knowles temporarily replaced member Kelly Rowland after she broke her toes backstage during a costume change. At 15, Knowles replaced a departed dancer and performed with the group on tour.

==Career==

===2001–2003: Early career and &quot;Solo Star&quot;===
Managed by her father Mathew, Knowles first ventured into the music business in 2001 as the lead singer, backed by Destiny&#x27;s Child, on the title theme song for the animated television series &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. She also was a featured performer on &quot;Hey Goldmember&quot; for the soundtrack to the 2002 film &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, as well as a backup singer on the track &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; on Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s 2001 holiday album &quot;8 Days of Christmas&quot;. In 2002, she was featured on Lil&#x27; Romeo&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Game Time&quot;, singing portions of Luther Vandross-penned &quot;So Amazing&quot; on the single &quot;True Love&quot;, and on Kelly Rowland&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Simply Deep&quot;, for which she also wrote the tracks &quot;Simply Deep&quot;, &quot;Beyond Imagination&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot;. In 2001 she appeared as Lil&#x27; Bow Wow&#x27;s date in the music video for his single &quot;Puppy Love&quot;. She also made an appearance on &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; soundtrack and made cameos in Play&#x27;s video for &quot;M.A.S.T.E.R. (Part II)&quot; featuring Lil&#x27; Fizz.

In 2002, she lent her voice to the character Chanel, the cousin of the protagonist Penny Proud, in an episode of the animated television series &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles excitedly announced that he was considering adding Knowles to Destiny&#x27;s Child when the group reunited in 2004, thus turning them into a quartet for the first time since short-lived member Farrah Franklin left in 2000. Mathew Knowles said he was testing the reactions, and, judging by what he had heard, &quot;it seems like a good idea&quot;. Later in August, however, Beyoncé said it was only a rumor and Destiny&#x27;s Child would remain a trio. Rowland added, &quot;She&#x27;s a solo star&quot;, name-dropping Knowles&#x27;s debut album.

At age 14, Knowles started working on her debut album &quot;Solo Star&quot;, which involved American producers such as Jermaine Dupri, the Neptunes, Linda Perry and Timbaland among others. She then recorded the album under her father&#x27;s Music World Entertainment label with Columbia Records. The album is primarily uptempo R&amp;B, although Knowles said there are pop, rock, reggae and hip hop influences. Knowles co-wrote and co-produced some of the 15 tracks in the album, including its lead single, &quot;Feelin&#x27; You (Part II)&quot;. The song failed to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but reached number three on both the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. &quot;Solo Star&quot; was released on January 21, 2003, in the United States, where it debuted at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached number 23 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. &quot;Solo Star&quot; had a mixed critical reception: William Ruhlmann of AllMusic called it a &quot;state-of-the-art contemporary R&amp;B album&quot;, but deemed Knowles &quot;lost somewhere in the mix&quot;. By mid-2008, the album had sold 112,000 copies domestically according to Nielsen SoundScan.

===2004–2008: Films and &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot;===
After the release of her debut album, Knowles began acting in films, followed by a career break to start a family. In 2004, she guest-starred in an episode titled &quot;The Catch&quot; on the sitcom &quot;One on One&quot;. Knowles appeared as a teenager in the 2004 comedy film &quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot;, starring alongside American actors Cedric the Entertainer, Vanessa Williams and Bow Wow. She provided a song, &quot;Freedom&quot;, a collaboration with the Houston-based funk-jazz band Drop Trio, for its soundtrack. Although the reviews were generally negative, Knowles earned praise from &quot;Variety&quot;, which opined that she &quot;is nearly as dazzling as big sister Beyoncé and does little more than smile winningly in her first bigscreen outing&quot;.
In 2006, she starred as a cheerleading captain in the film &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Bring It On&quot; series, alongside American actress and singer Hayden Panettiere. What little critical reaction the low-budget, direct-to-DVD movie got was negative, and Knowles was described as an &quot;affordable young starlet&quot;. Knowles uses her full name for acting, rather than just the first name she uses when singing; for &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot;, she was billed as Solange Knowles-Smith, reflecting her married state at the time.

While she was married, her family moved to Idaho, and while staying there, she resumed writing songs including the singles &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; and &quot;Upgrade U&quot; from her sister&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot;. Knowles earned the R&amp;B and Hip-Hop Song accolade for &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; at the 2008 ASCAP Awards. During this time, she had also written songs for Destiny&#x27;s Child, and members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. In 2004, while pregnant with her son, she made a cameo appearance in Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s music video for &quot;Soldier&quot;.

After her divorce, Knowles returned to Houston to begin working on her second album. In 2007, Knowles renewed her management, signing a record deal with Geffen and a publishing deal with EMI. Knowles finished working on her second studio album in 2008 and titled the project &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot;. It includes production by CeeLo Green, Soulshock &amp; Karlin and Mark Ronson as well as an appearance by Bilal. A collection of 1960s and 1970s influenced songs, it is seen as a departure from her pop-oriented debut, with what &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;more of a modern twist on hip-hop and R&amp;B flecked with tinges of blues and jazz&quot;. The album was released on August 26, 2008, in the United States. By December 2008, the album had sold over 114,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was positively received by critics, with Ian Griffin of &quot;The Guardian&quot; considering it far better than her debut. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I Decided&quot;, was released in April 2008, and reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labelled it her breakthrough single. In support of the album, Knowles began the Solange Presents Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams Tour in Britain in November 2008.

Knowles announced via her blog that she would be releasing a series of mixtapes to coincide with the album. The first mixtape, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Clearance...&quot;, includes the leaked track &quot;Fuck the Industry (Signed Sincerely)&quot;. On this record, Knowles expressed her views on the current state of the music industry. The lyrics to the song name check some major artists such as Mary J. Blige, Ashanti, Keyshia Cole, and Beyoncé, although she made a point of stating that it does not have &quot;a negative light to any of [them]&quot;. The mixtape was never released, but Knowles released &quot;Fuck the Industry (Signed Sincerely)&quot; as a single in 2010.

===2009–2014: &quot;True&quot; EP and Saint Records===

In an interview with MTV in 2009, Knowles revealed that she was determining the type of sound for the follow-up to &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot;. During this time, Knowles also parted ways with the Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M record label group. She would now release her third studio album independently. Early in 2010, Knowles traveled to Australia to work with Australian rock band Midnight Juggernauts on her third studio album. Knowles had planned to release the album in summer as revealed on her official Twitter account in 2009. She also confirmed on Twitter that she rented a house in Santa Barbara, California to get into a certain state of mind while writing and making music. On May 7, 2010, Knowles made a guest appearance on the popular children&#x27;s show, &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; for a &quot;Mothers Day Special&quot; where she performed an original song called &quot;Momma Loves Baby&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; on July 7, 2010, Knowles said she suffered &quot;a little bit of a breakdown&quot; while recording her new album: &quot;I literally gave up my sanity for a while to do this record. [...] We literally were waking up in the morning and just making music all day and all night. [...] It just started to wear on me in so many different ways. I started having these crazy panic attacks.&quot; Knowles explained how she made sacrifices &quot;mentally, emotionally and financially&quot;, and continued, &quot;It&#x27;s more than an album to me. It&#x27;s a transitional time in my life.&quot; Regarding the musical direction of the album, she said the inspiration came from new wave and stated, &quot;This is a dance record, but the lyrics can get pretty dark at times.&quot;

In September 2012, Knowles released a teaser video for &quot;Losing You&quot;, which was announced as the lead single from the EP &quot;True&quot;. This release marked Knowles&#x27;s first release as a signee of the independent label Terrible Records. The video was shot in Cape Town, South Africa in early September 2012. Knowles revealed in an interview that her mother Tina had paid for Knowles and her friends to fly out and record the video as her birthday gift. On October 24, 2012, Knowles held a listening party in New York City for her EP &quot;True&quot;, released for digital download on iTunes on November 27, 2012. The CD and vinyl was made available on January 8, 2013. Following the EP&#x27;s release, Knowles appeared on the cover of &quot;The Fader&quot; magazine&#x27;s 84th issue.

On May 14, 2013, Knowles announced that she had launched her own record label named Saint Records, which she would be using to release her third full-length album and future music projects distributed through Sony. Saint Records was established to focus on not-yet mainstream hip-hop and R&amp;B artists. She also collaborated with the Lonely Island on the song &quot;Semicolon&quot;, which was showcased as part of YouTube&#x27;s Comedy Week and is featured on the group&#x27;s album, &quot;The Wack Album&quot;. On November 11, 2013, Knowles&#x27;s record label released its first compilation album, &quot;Saint Heron&quot;.

===2015–present: &quot;A Seat at the Table&quot; and &quot;When I Get Home&quot;===

On May 15, 2015, Knowles performed &quot;Rise&quot; for the first time at an HBO-sponsored event, which was inspired by police killings of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray, and the subsequent protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. In July 2015, Knowles announced that her third studio album was nearly complete. On her thirtieth birthday, June 24, 2016, she stated that she had completed &quot;A Seat at the Table&quot; three days before her birthday, on June 21. The album was released on September 30, 2016, to universal critical acclaim. It became her first number-one album in the United States. This made her and Beyoncé the first sisters to have both had US number-one albums in a calendar year. On October 3, 2016, Knowles released music videos for the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch My Hair&quot; and &quot;Cranes in the Sky&quot;, both co-directed by herself and Alan Ferguson.

In June 2017, Knowles performed at the Glastonbury Festival; her performance earned a perfect five-star review from Patrick Smith of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, who deemed her &quot;an artist to be cherished&quot; and the performance itself &quot;fantastic theatre&quot;. In December 2017, Knowles directed the video for the song &quot;The Weekend&quot; by SZA. In 2019, Knowles performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Parklife festival, the Lovebox Festival, and the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. On March 1, she released her fourth studio album, &quot;When I Get Home&quot;. She previously teased the album by posting two video snippets on her Instagram and Twitter as well as a personal web page on the African-American social networking site BlackPlanet. Stereo Williams of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; deemed the album a confirmation that Knowles &quot;is one of the most talented singer-songwriters of her generation&quot;.

==Artistry==

===Music and influences===
On her debut album, Knowles had no control over which kinds of music to produce, stating that &quot;when you&#x27;re 14, everyone else is older and more seasoned and you trust their decisions&quot;. She was more concerned with pleasing her record label by submitting to their desires.

Her musical influences were better expressed on &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot;, when she considered herself mature and was able to write and produce songs as she wished, without worrying about the expectations of others. Knowles&#x27;s lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends, with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood. The album touched upon a variety of genres including pop-soul, psychedelic soul, electronica, and R&amp;B.

Knowles&#x27;s debut extended play &quot;True&quot; is a new wave album with Knowles stating, &quot;This is a dance record, but the lyrics can get pretty dark at times&quot;. Knowles described the EP as &quot;eclectic with 1980s references and African percussion influences&quot;. Sonically the extended play is influenced by the keyboard sounds and beats of early 1980s pop and R&amp;B music. The EP was recorded in five cities including Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Houston, New York, and on the German &quot;Autobahn&quot;. Her 2016 album, &quot;A Seat at The Table&quot;, discusses themes such as &quot;black womanhood&quot;, &quot;Southern culture and glory&quot;, and &quot;what it means to be free and not free all at once&quot;.

==Performance art and ballet==
Outside her work of being a singer-songwriter, Knowles has also ventured into performance art. In an interview with &quot;Surface&quot; magazine, she said &quot;I&#x27;m not at all interested in entertainment. I&#x27;m really interested in energy exchange between the viewer and the performer. One way to do that is to make an inclusive experience through style, through energy, through space.&quot; She has put on subsequent performance art pieces throughout the world, including &quot;Witness!&quot; at the Elbphilharmonie, &quot;Metatronia (Metatron&#x27;s Cube)&quot; at the Hammer Museum and &quot;Bridge-s&quot; at the Getty Museum. In November 2019, Knowles directed and composed the art and music performance &quot;In Past Pupils and Smiles&quot; at the Venice Art Biennale. In August 2022, the New York City Ballet announced that Knowles would compose a score for the Fall Fashion Gala the following September, becoming the third woman and first African American to serve in that role for the company.

==Public image==

Knowles is often compared to her sister, Beyoncé, whom she considers one of her role models. She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to &quot;God Given Name&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m not her and never will be&quot; – which was purposely set as the opening track of &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot; to show their differences. In his review for the album, Jody Rosen of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence. Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry, reasoning that it &quot;involves a lot of pressure&quot;. Knowles countered by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s good to have her advice, but we really have different goals&quot;. In her self-titled album, Beyoncé credits Knowles with the lyric &quot;my sister told me I should speak my mind&quot;, as she acknowledges the impact her family has made on her life.

Knowles has been described as a fashion icon. Her knack for bold colors, mixed prints, and retro styles, as well as her knack for glamorous, fashion-forward looks in her music videography and public appearances, has become integral to her current image. She has been photographed wearing Alexander Wang, Alexander McQueen, and Chanel. The music video for her 2012 single &quot;Losing You&quot; featured a heavy demonstration of the contemporary sartorial movement throughout Africa, La Sape.

Similarly, her decision to grow her natural hair initially generated strong reactions from the public. In a cover interview with Toyin Ojih Odutola for &quot;Cultured Magazine&quot;, Knowles addressed her shift to minimalist fashion and the response she received from the public, &quot;This idea that black women could not be minimalist, we could not be subtle— we have to be big, we have to be loud, we have to be an explosive presence.&quot;

At the 2017 Glamour Women of the Year awards, Knowles wore a yellow Jean-Paul Gaultier couture gown, with a blonde afro, and was named a Woman of the Year.

Knowles is an activist for the Black Lives Matter movement. After the Charleston church shooting in June 2015, Knowles released a statement posing the following questions: &quot;Where can we be safe? Where can we be free? Where can we be black?&quot; In July 2016, she marched in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in protest of the shooting of Alton Sterling; she also criticized police presence during the march.

==Other ventures==
In 2007, Knowles began promoting Baby Jamz, a hip hop-styled toy line for pre-schoolers. It was inspired by her son, who is fond of hip hop music. She is the executive producer of the CD, composed of updated hip hop inspired nursery rhymes, which is featured in all of the toys.

In 2008, Knowles was named as ambassador for Giorgio Armani&#x27;s younger diffusion line, Armani Jeans. Armani said Knowles epitomizes the style, which is a &quot;vision of a young, independent, casual lifestyle with a strong and cool, fashion sensibility&quot;.

In 2009, Knowles was featured in Ocean Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Music&quot; and &quot;OPen Campus&quot; ad campaigns.

In 2010, Knowles worked on the award-winning children&#x27;s television series &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;. She performed an original song &quot;Momma Loves Baby&quot; in the special episode titled &quot;Baby&quot;. She also sang &quot;Momma Loves Baby&quot; live when the show toured the Dallas–Fort Worth area.

In 2011, Knowles, Alejandra Ramos Munoz and Zooey Deschanel were announced as the new faces of Rimmel London. At the time, Knowles was also the face of Carol&#x27;s Daughter. She stepped down from this position in 2012, amid criticism of her natural hair.

In 2013, Knowles was named art director and creative consultant at Puma. In this role, she curated four women&#x27;s shoe collections: &quot;Girls of Blaze&quot; (2014), &quot;Wild Wonder&quot; (2014), &quot;Behind the Baazar&quot; (2014) and &quot;Word to the Woman&quot; (2015).

In 2017, Knowles became the face of a Calvin Klein campaign.

In 2018, Knowles received the Artist of the Year award from the Harvard Foundation. She became the face of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s campaign &quot;#WEWONDER&quot; and Helmut Lang&#x27;s fashion campaign. She also began a collaboration for interior design with IKEA.

In 2020, Knowles was the recipient of the inaugural Lena Horne Prize.

In 2022, Knowles was the star of LOUIS XIII&#x27;s &quot;Believe in Time&quot; campaign. She was also honored with the 2022 NYU Global Trailblazer Award.

In 2023, Knowles designed a glassware collection, in collaboration with glassblower Jason McDonald.

In 2024, Knowles appeared alongside her mother in a Gucci Gift campaign.

===House of Deréon===
Knowles and sister Beyoncé modeled for their family&#x27;s clothing line, House of Deréon, named after their grandmother, Agnéz Deréon. She also helped launch Deréon, a junior apparel collection and sister line to House of Deréon. Both sisters modeled for Deréon, and were featured in most of Deréon&#x27;s marketing campaigns. Together they were featured in a &quot;Got Milk?&quot; campaign ad, wearing House of Deréon.

===Saint Heron===
In 2013, Knowles launched the digital platform Saint Heron as a music and cultural hub to amplify Black artistry. In May 2021, Saint Heron expanded into an institution that includes a studio, creative agency, library, and art gallery.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
Knowles married Daniel Smith in the Bahamas in February 2004, when she was 17 and he was 19. On October 18, 2004, Knowles gave birth to a son. After their son&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Moscow, Idaho, where Knowles&#x27;s husband continued studying in college. The two divorced in 2007, after which Knowles split her time between her residences in Los Angeles and Houston, Texas. She and her son relocated to Brooklyn in 2011, and to New Orleans, Louisiana in 2013.

Knowles married music video director Alan Ferguson at the Marigny Opera House in New Orleans on November 16, 2014. The couple separated in 2019.

That year, Knowles began dating experimental jazz artist Gio Escobar from the band Standing on the Corner, with whom she had previously collaborated on her studio album &quot;When I Get Home&quot;. Knowles publicly acknowledged the relationship on Instagram in November 2020.

===Elevator attack video===
On May 12, 2014, TMZ released security video footage of Knowles appearing to physically attack her brother-in-law Jay-Z and being restrained by a security guard in an elevator at The Standard, High Line in Manhattan. The video went viral, receiving media attention from news organizations and gossip columnists, with many wondering what led to the confrontation. The moment was mentioned in monologues on Late-night talk shows such as &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.&quot; The matter was spoofed on television shows including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Knowles, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé called the occurrence an &quot;unfortunate incident&quot; and stated that the family &quot;has worked through it&quot;. Knowles later clarified that she and her family were &quot;all good&quot;.

<text>Texas Southern University (Texas Southern or TSU) is a public historically black university in Houston. The university is a member school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

Texas Southern University is an important institution in Houston&#x27;s Third Ward. Alvia Wardlaw of &quot;&quot; wrote that the university serves as &quot;the cultural and community center of&quot; the Third Ward area where it is located, in addition to being its university. The university also serves as a notable economic resource for Greater Houston, contributing over $500 million to the region&#x27;s gross sales and being directly and indirectly responsible for over 3,000 jobs.

Texas Southern University intercollegiate sports teams, the Tigers, compete in NCAA Division I and the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). Texas Southern is home of the Ocean of Soul marching band.

== History ==
On March 7, 1927, the Houston Independent School District board resolved to establish junior colleges for each race, as the state was racially segregated in all public facilities. The resolution created Houston Junior College, which later became the University of Houston, and Houston Colored Junior College, which first held classes at Jack Yates High School during the evenings. The school&#x27;s name was later changed to Houston College for Negroes in 1934.

In February 1946, Heman Marion Sweatt, an African American man, applied to the University of Texas School of Law. He was denied admission because of race, and subsequently filed suit in &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; (1950). The state had no law school for African Americans. To avoid integrating the University of Texas Law School, the state of Texas made several offers to Heman Marion Sweatt to keep him from going to court. They offered to establish the Texas State University of Negroes which would include a law school. Some black leaders welcomed the idea of having another state supported university in Texas, while many others felt as though the university was created to solely avoid the integration of the University of Texas, as well as other white institutions. In the end, they did not grant Sweatt a &quot;writ of mandamus&quot; to attend the University of Texas. Instead the trial court granted a continuance for six months to allow the state time to create a law school for blacks.

As a result, the Fiftieth Texas Legislature passed Texas Senate Bill 140 on March 3, 1947, authorizing and funding the creation of Texas State University for Negroes as the first state university to be located in Houston. The school was established to serve African Americans in Texas and offer them fields of study comparable to those available to white Texans. The state took over the Houston Independent School District (HISD)-run Houston College for Negroes as a basis for the new university. Houston College moved to the present site (adjacent to the University of Houston), which was donated by Hugh Roy Cullen. It had one permanent building and an existing faculty and students. The new university was charged with teaching &quot;pharmacy, dentistry, arts and sciences, journalism, education, literature, law, medicine and other professional courses.&quot; The legislature stipulated that &quot;these courses shall be equivalent to those offered at other institutions of this type supported by the State of Texas.&quot;

Given the differences in facilities and intangibles, such as the distance of the new school from Austin, the University of Texas School of Law, and other law students, the United States Supreme Court ruled the new facility did not satisfy &quot;separate but equal&quot; provisions. It ruled that African Americans must also be admitted to the University of Texas Law School at Austin. See &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; (1950).

In March 1960, Texas Southern University students organized Houston&#x27;s first sit-in at the Weingarten&#x27;s lunch counter located at 4110 Almeda. The success of their efforts inspired more sit-ins throughout the city, which, within months, led to the desegregation of many of Houston&#x27;s public establishments. A historical marker commissioned by the Texas Historical Commission stands on the property of the first sit-in to commemorate the courageous acts of those TSU students. That property is now a U.S. Post Office. TSU journalism professor Serbino Sandifer-Walker worked for nearly two years with the Texas Historical Commission, the original students who led the march, and many other stakeholders, to have the historic marker designated on March 4, 2010, the fiftieth anniversary of that sit-in.

On May 17, 1967, it was reported that students at TSU rioted on campus. When officers responded thousands of shots were fired and there were injuries on both sides including a death of a police officer. Nearly 500 students were arrested. Although media sources reported this as a riot, there were no reports of looting, destruction of property, or resistance of any arrest. Furthermore, the reports failed to mention the prior invasion of police officers on campus, or the reports of students getting roughed up on campus. The police raid caused over $10,000 of damage and it was reported over 3,000 shots were fired into the Lanier dormitory. There was little coverage that, the five students whom were charged with conspiracy and incitement of riot were all exonerated due to lack of evidence, or that the police officer died not from student fire, but the ricochet of Houston Police Department bullets.
A Democratic presidential debate took place on September 12, 2019, in TSU&#x27;s Health and Physical Education Arena.

The university drew national attention in early 2020 when the Governor of Texas appointed board of trustees targeted the university&#x27;s sitting president and changed its bylaws to give the board the power to remove anyone employed by the university. The board first suspended and then fired president Austin Lane, alleging that he failed to inform them about allegations of fraud committed by a former assistant dean at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law. Lane disputed the allegations. Just prior to removing Lane, the board also changed its bylaws to allow it to &quot;approve the termination of any position&quot; at the university, a change that drew condemnation from several university governance experts as inappropriate micromanagement. In February 2020, the board of trustees publicly agreed there was no wrongdoing on the part of Lane and paid him nearly $900,000 in the buyout of his contract. A new president was to be named in 2020. In February 2020, one month prior to the visit of a site visit team representing the university&#x27;s regional accreditor, the board partially repealed the new bylaws that allowed them to fire any university employee.

==Campus==

The university has more than 45 buildings on a urban gated campus centrally located in Houston. The campus is two miles southeast of downtown Houston and five miles east of Uptown Houston. TSU is recognized as a &quot;Tree Campus USA&quot; school for its commitment to preserving and increasing campus trees.

The school&#x27;s first structure was the Thornton B. Fairchild Building, built 1947–1948 and housing administration and classroom space. Temporary buildings served as faculty housing during that time. The Mack H. Hannah hall, designed by Lamar Q. Cato and opened in 1950, was the second building. In the late 1950s many more buildings opened, including classroom, dormitory, and student union facilities.

==Notable buildings==

===University Museum===
Completed in 2000, the exhibition space displays a variety of historical and contemporary art. The museum is the permanent home of the &quot;Web of Life&quot;, a twenty-six-foot mural by world-renowned artist John T. Biggers, founding chairman of the TSU art department.

===Mack H. Hannah Hall===
Multiple TSU student-created murals are present in Hannah Hall.

The building had two 1971 murals by Harvey Johnson, a longtime TSU art instructor, about African influences in U.S. culture and mothers: &quot;Mothers of &quot;the Fathers and the Son&quot;&quot; and &quot;Dere&#x27;s a &quot;Han Writin on de Wall&quot;&quot;. He was educated by the founder of the TSU art school, Dr. John T. Biggers. It, as part of the Black Power movement, was Johnson&#x27;s senior project, as the university at the time allowed its students to create murals on campus property. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) was a feature of the titles.

In 2008 incoming TSU president John Rudley had the murals painted over with white paint, stating that they were not high quality enough. A spokesperson initially said that the painting over was an error but Rudley later stated it was intentional. The director of the university museum, Alvia J. Wardlaw, who teaches art history, expressed disagreement with the decision. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; criticized the removal in an editorial. Johnson himself expressed disappointment with the removal. Rudley later appropriated funds for possible restoration of memorials due to the negative reception.

===Leonard H.O. Spearman Technology===

In 2014, TSU unveiled a $31 million, 108,000-square-foot, four-story structure named after the school&#x27;s fifth president. In addition to having 35 labs, the facility is home to a Tier 1 University Transportation Center, the Center for Transportation Training and Research, and the National Science Foundation Center for Research on Complex Networks. The departments of Engineering, Transportation Studies, Computer Science, Industrial Technology, Physics, and Aviation Science and Technology academic programs are housed in the building. TSU is the only four-year state supported university in Texas to offer a Pilot Ground School course and the first HBCU to implement a Maritime Transportation degree program.

===Jesse H. Jones School of Business===
Jesse H. Jones (JHJ) School of Business is located in a three-story, 76,000-square-foot building completed in 1998 and accommodates 1,600 students in undergraduate and graduate studies. The Jesse H. Jones School of Business is the first business school at a HBCU to be accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and been named one of the &quot;Best Business Schools&quot; by the &quot;Princeton Review&quot;. JHJ School of Business is consistently one of the highest ranked business schools from a public HBCU in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings.

===College of Education===
The College of Education building consists of the Department of Counseling, the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, the Department of Educational Administration &amp; Foundations, and the Department of Health and Kinesiology. The college has an enrollment of approximately 1,200 in undergraduate and graduate studies. In 2014, the National Council on Teacher Quality ranked TSU&#x27;s College of Education 56th in the nation for best secondary education programs and gave the college a &quot;top-ranked&quot; distinction.

===Barbara Jordan–Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs===
An extensive set of curricular offerings is provided through the Barbara Jordan–Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs, which offers courses in Administration of Justice (AJ), Political Science (POLS), Public Affairs (PA), Military Science (MSCI), and Urban Planning &amp; Environmental Policy (UPEP) on the undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral level. The school sits in an 82,000-square-foot facility completed in 2008.

====TSU Justice Center====
On January 22, 2018, the university published a new establishment Center for Justice Research (CJR) in the Barbara Jordan–Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs. The center is intended to create innovative solutions to criminal justice alteration and address challenges in America&#x27;s criminal justice system. The award is granted by Charles Koch Foundation and Koch Industries.

===TSU Science Center===

The TSU Science Center building is home to several scholastic programs, such as the Houston Louis Stokes Alliance Minority Program (H-LSAMP). It also houses several research programs, such as the NASA University Research Center for Bio-Nanotechnology and Environmental Research (NASA URC C-BER), Maritime Transportation Studies and Research, as well as the STEM research program. TSU&#x27;s NASA University Research Center (C-BER) addresses human health concerns related to crewed exploration of space. Programs like TSU&#x27;s NASA University Research Center (C-BER) and participation in The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Preparation Program (LSAMP) support undergraduate, graduate and faculty development while helping to increase the number of US citizens receiving degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The science center also houses the only doctoral degree program in environmental toxicology in Southeast Texas.

===Spurgeon N. Gray Hall (COPHS)===
The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (COPHS) is housed in the Spurgeon N. Gray Hall. COPHS has approximately 800 students. The 2016 pharmacy graduates had a 90% first-attempt pass rate on the NAPLEX which was above the national average (85%), third highest in Texas, and highest among HBCUs. TSU is one of only two public HBCUs in the United States with an accredited and comprehensive pharmacy program. COPHS is the first and only in Houston to offer a Master of Science in Health Care Administration degree.

===Thurgood Marshall School of Law===
The Thurgood Marshall School of Law (TMSL) is one of six public law schools in Texas and ranks as one of the most diverse law schools in the nation by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. TMSL is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) and a member-school of The Association of American Law Schools (AALS). Enrollment is at approximately 600 students.

The Texas College for Negroes was initially housed in Austin, Texas but was eventually transferred to Texas Southern University&#x27;s campus. The creation of the Law School did not have the support of Thurgood Marshall or the NAACP. However, in 1976 now U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, agreed to name formally the &quot;Law School of Texas Southern University,&quot; the &quot;Thurgood Marshall School of Law.&quot;

===Transportation===

Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) operates public transportation services, including buses and the METRORail tram service, which serve the university. The METRORail Purple Line station serving the university is Robertson Stadium/UH/TSU station.

In June 2019 Texas Southern University became home to the region&#x27;s first Shared Autonomous Shuttle in conjunction with a partnership between METRO, TSU and the Houston-Galveston Area Council. The shuttle can carry up to 15 passengers and travels using a pre-programmed route, equipped with a sensor and intelligent vehicle system to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.

<doc id="543905" wikidata="Q5097774" url="?curid=543905" title="Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act">
<text>The Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988, title VII, subtitle N of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, , , is part of a United States Act of Congress which places record-keeping requirements on the producers of actual, sexually explicit materials. The implementing regulations (colloquially known as 2257 regulations) (C.F.R. Part 75), part of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, require producers of sexually explicit material to obtain proof of age for every model they shoot and retain those records. Federal inspectors may inspect these records at any time and prosecute violations.

== Allied administrative law (2257 regulations) ==
The administrative law that has been created by virtue of the Act to guide and aid its enforcement, 28 C.F.R. 75 (also known as the 2257 regulations), specifies record-keeping requirements for those wishing to produce sexually explicit media, and imposes criminal penalties for failure to comply. This is intended to ensure that no person under the legal age is involved in such undertakings. (See and Child pornography laws in the United States for more information about the term &quot;sexually explicit&quot;.)

The regulations define the terms &quot;primary producer&quot; and &quot;secondary producer&quot;. The term &quot;produces&quot; means:

A &quot;primary producer&quot; is defined in the set of rules as

A &quot;secondary producer&quot; is

One may be both a primary and a secondary producer.

&quot;Manage content&quot; means

&quot;Computer site or service&quot; means

The regulations also spell out requirements for the maintenance, categorization, location, and inspection of records, as well as legal grounds for exemption of these requirements. They require that records be maintained for five years after the dissolution of a business that had been required to maintain them.

The Department of Justice can modify the regulations, based on the discretion, or possible future requirements, that has been given to it to do so by the Act.

==Enforcement==
It is clear there is much sexual material on the Internet and elsewhere that would fall within the terms of this law. At present, the U.S. Department of Justice has only implemented one specific case based primarily on the new 2257 laws and its supportive regulations. The case was against Mantra Films, Inc., based in Santa Monica, California, and its sister company MRA Holdings (both owned by Joe Francis), who are the originators of the &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; video series. Francis and several of his managers were prosecuted, citing infractions of this act.
In January 2007, these charges were for the most part dropped.

However, Francis and the company entered guilty pleas on three counts of failing to keep the required records and seven labeling violations for its series of DVDs and videos before U.S. District Judge Richard Smoak, agreeing to pay $2.1 million in fines and restitution. This allowed Francis to avoid possible harsher penalties which include five years prison time for each violation.

Also in 2006, the FBI, under the direction of United States attorney general John Ashcroft, began checking the 2257 records of several pornography production companies.

The final regulations implementing Congressional amendments to 2257, termed 2257A, were updated December 18, 2008, and went into effect on the same day as the inauguration of Barack Obama. On that same day, January 20, 2009, President Obama, through Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, requested by memorandum that heads of departments allow for review by the incoming administration of all regulations not then final.

==Legal challenges==
The initial iteration of 2257, first passed in 1988, mandated that producers keep records of the age and identity of performers and affix statements as to the location of the records to depictions. However, rather than penalties for noncompliance, the statute created a rebuttable presumption that the performer was a minor. Pub. L. 100-690. This version was struck down as unconstitutional in &quot;American Library Association v. Thornburgh&quot; on First Amendment grounds. 713 F. Supp. 469 (D.D.C. 1989) vacated as moot 956 F.2d 1178 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

After &quot;Thornburgh&quot;, Congress amended 2257 to impose direct criminal penalties for noncompliance with the record-keeping requirements. The same plaintiffs challenged the amended statute and accompanying regulations, but the new version was upheld by &quot;American Library Association v. Reno&quot;, 33 F.3d 78 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

In &quot;Sundance Association Inc. v. Reno&quot;, 139 F.3d 804 (10th Cir. 1998), the Tenth Circuit rejected the regulation&#x27;s distinction between primary and secondary producers and entirely exempted from the record-keeping requirements those who merely distribute or those whose activity &quot;does not involve hiring, contracting for, managing, or otherwise arranging for the participation of the performers depicted.&quot; 18 U.S.C. § 2257(h)(3).

=== PROTECT ACT related challenges ===

==== Challenges to initial regulations (2005 to 2010) ====
In 2004, bound by the new PROTECT Act of 2003, the DOJ made changes to the 2257 regulations to keep up with the proliferation of sexually explicit material found on the Internet. Currently the 18 U.S.C. 2257 regulations do not pertain to simulated pornography (e.g., hentai, etc.) provided such is not facially obscene.

In June 2005, the Free Speech Coalition (an advocacy group for the adult entertainment industry) sued the Department of Justice to enjoin the regulations until they could obtain a court hearing. In December 2006, a federal judge issued an injunction protecting secondary producers who were members of the Free Speech Coalition, but FBI inspections of these producers were still ongoing despite the injunction. On March 30, 2007, District Court Judge Walker Miller issued an interim ruling, which dismissed some causes of action and allowed others from the initial 2005 case to proceed in light of the Walsh Act amendments. The actual trial phase had not yet begun.On October 23, 2007, the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the federal record-keeping statute unconstitutional, holding that the law is overly broad and facially invalid. The Sixth Circuit subsequently reheard the case &quot;en banc&quot; and issued an opinion on February 20, 2009, upholding the constitutionality of the record-keeping requirements, albeit with some dissents. The United States Supreme Court refused to hear (denied certiorari to) the April 2009 challenge to &quot;Connection Distributing Co. v. Holder&quot;, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on the legality of 2257 and its enforcement. (See &quot;Order List&quot;, Monday, October 5, 2009).

==== Challenges to later 2007 regulations (2010 to 2016) ====
After a July 2010 decision by U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson to dismiss the FSC&#x27;s lawsuit per the request of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder&#x27;s DOJ, agreeing that USC 2257 and 2257A regulations are constitutional, the FSC then filed an additional appeal to amend their original challenge to the constitutionality challenge. On Monday, September 20, 2010, Judge Baylson rejected FSC&#x27;s amended appeal, allowing the government record-keeping inspections to be restarted.

The FSC appealed this case to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2016, the court ruled that the record-keeping regulations did not violate the First Amendment. However, they also ruled that requiring adult producers to make the records available without a warrant, accessible by law enforcement for any reason, violated a producer&#x27;s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.

<text>The 1st Army Tank Brigade was a formation of the British Army during the Second World War. A &quot;Tank&quot; Brigade was intended to support the Infantry and was mostly equipped with slow moving Infantry tanks, unlike an Armoured Brigade, which was equipped with faster cruiser tanks and later its own motorised infantry. Initially using infantry nomenclature for its smaller units, &quot;company &quot; and &quot;section&quot; and having 175 light and infantry tanks, it later adopted cavalry nomenclature of &quot;squadron&quot; and &quot;troop&quot; and later in the War grew to 240 tanks. Its designation was changed on 14 April 1940 to 1st Tank Brigade.

==History==
The 1st Army Tank Brigade took part in the Battle of France, serving as part of the British Expeditionary Force. It fought against the Germans in Belgium and Northern France, providing the armour for the counter-attack at the Battle of Arras and covered the Allied retreat to Dunkirk. It lost all of its equipment on the beaches following the evacuation.

The reformed 1st Army Tank Brigade was transferred to North Africa, equipped with Valentine infantry tanks. The brigade took part in Operation Crusader, as part of the XIII Corps. Attached to the 2nd South African Division, it took part in the conquest of Bardia (December 1941 – January 1942).

The 1st Tank Brigade was disbanded 21 November 1944.

<text>The Tugela River (; ) is the largest river in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. With a total length of , and a drop of 1370 metres in the lower 480 km, it is one of the most important rivers of the country.

The river originates in Mont-aux-Sources of the Drakensberg Mountains at an elevation of 3282 metres and plunges in five distinct free-leaping falls 947 metres down the Tugela Falls. The Mont-aux-Sources is also the origin of tributaries of two other major South African rivers, the Orange and the Caledon River. From the Drakensberg range, the Tugela follows a route through the KwaZulu-Natal midlands before flowing into the Indian Ocean. The total catchment area is approximately . Land uses in the catchment are mainly rural subsistence farming and commercial forestry.

==Tributaries==

The Tugela is fed by a number of tributaries coming off the Drakensberg, the largest being the Mzinyathi (&quot;Buffalo&quot;) River (rising near Majuba Hill). Others are the Little Tugela River, Klip River (rising near Van Reenen Pass), Mooi River, Blood River, Sundays River (rising in the Biggarsberg) Ingagani River and Bushman River. The Buffalo River joins the Tugela some east of Tugela Ferry at .

The Blood River was named by the Boers, led by Andries Pretorius, after they defeated the Zulu king Dingane on 16 December 1838. The river is said to have run red with the blood of Zulu warriors. Below the Blood River is Rorke&#x27;s Drift, a crossing point and a battle site, in the Anglo-Zulu War.

==Ecology==
The scaly yellowfish &quot;(Labeobarbus natalensis)&quot; is found in the Tugela River System. It is a common endemic fish in KwaZulu-Natal Province and it is found in different habitats between the Drakensberg foothills and the coastal lowlands, including rivers such as the Umkomazi.

==Spelling==
The spelling &quot;Tugela&quot; was used for most of the twentieth century; it is an Anglicised version of the Zulu name &quot;Thukela&quot;. Nineteenth-century writers adopted a variety of spellings including:
*Isaacs (1836) used a number of different spellings in his book, &quot;Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa,&quot; including &quot;Ootergale&quot; and &quot;Ootoogale&quot;.
*C.R. Maclean (John Ross), writing in the &quot;Nautical Magazine&quot; in 1853, used the spelling &quot;Zootagoola&quot;
*George French Angas, a nineteenth-century artist, used the name &quot;Tugala&quot; on the captions to his sketches.

Some of the variations can be accounted for by the early European writers being unaware that Zulu grammar uses prefixes, often a &quot;&quot;i-&quot; or a &quot;u-&quot;&quot;, to denote the noun class of a noun.

<doc id="543924" wikidata="Q868645" url="?curid=543924" title="Comrades Marathon">
<text>The Comrades Marathon is an ultramarathon of approximately which is run annually in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg. It is the world&#x27;s largest and oldest ultramarathon race. The direction of the race alternates each year between the &quot;up&quot; run (87.6km) starting from Durban (elevation: ) and the &quot;down&quot; run (87.7km) starting from Pietermaritzburg (elevation: ).

The 2019 field was capped at 25,000 runners, and the entry process closed after one week. South African runners constitute the greater part of the field, but many entrants hail from the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, India, the United States, Brazil, Australia, Botswana, Russia, Eswatini and Japan. In all but three runnings since 1988, over 10,000 runners have reached the finish within the allowed 11 or 12 hours. With increased participation since the 1980s, the average finish times for both sexes, and the average age of finishers have increased substantially.

The race was not held from 1941 to 1945 due to World War II, and the in-person edition of the race was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was resumed in 2022 with a field of 15,000 entrants.

Since 2019 runners over the age of 20 qualify when they are able to complete an officially recognised marathon (42.2 km) in under 4:50 (5 hours before 2019). During the event an athlete must also reach five cut-off points in specified times to complete the race. The spirit of the Comrades Marathon is said to be embodied by attributes of camaraderie, selflessness, dedication, perseverance, and ubuntu. 

==Course==

The race is run on the roads of KwaZulu-Natal province, marked by &quot;The Big Five&quot; set of hills. On the up run they appear in the following order: Cowies Hill, Fields Hill, Botha&#x27;s Hill, Inchanga, and Polly Shortts. The highest point of the race, at above sea level, is situated near the Umlaas Road interchange. Approximately 40 official refreshment stations along the route are stocked with soft drinks, water sachets, energy drink sachets, fruit, biscuits, energy bars, cooked potatoes and other refreshments. About eight physiotherapy and first aid stations are also located at strategic points.
==Rules==
Athletes currently have 12 hours to complete the course, extended from 11 hours in 2003 (including a special 12 hour allowance in the year 2000). The original Comrades cut-off time from 1921 to 1927 was also 12 hours, reduced to 11 hours in 1928. There are a number of cut-off points along the routes which runners must reach by a prescribed time or be forced to retire from the race. A runner who successfully completed nine marathons wears a yellow number, while those who completed ten races wear a green number, permanently allocated to the runner for all future races. Runners running their 20th, 30th and 40th races are also indicated by yellow numbers – differently formatted on different years.

Medals are awarded to all runners completing the course in under 12 hours. Medals are currently awarded as follows:

* Gold medal: the first 10 men and women.
* Wally Hayward medal (silver-centred circled by gold ring): 11th position to sub 6hrs 00min.
* Isavel Roche-Kelly medal (silver-centred circled by gold ring): women only, 11th position to sub 7hrs 00min.
* Silver medal: 6hrs 00min to sub 7hrs 30min.
* Bill Rowan medal (bronze-centred circled by silver ring): 7hrs 30min to sub 9hrs 00min.
*Robert Mtshali medal (titanium): 9hr 00min to sub 10hrs 00min.
* Bronze medal: 10hrs 00min to sub 11hrs 00min.
* Vic Clapham medal (copper): 11hrs 00min to sub 12hrs 00min.

- Prior to 2000, only gold, silver and bronze medals were awarded.

- The Bill Rowan medal was introduced in 2000 and named after the winner of the first Comrades Marathon in 1921. The time limit for this medal was inspired by Rowan&#x27;s winning time in 1921 of 8hrs 59min.

- A new copper medal, the Vic Clapham medal (named after the race founder), was added in 2003. This medal coincided with the increase in the time allocation for completing the event from sub 11hrs to sub 12hrs.

- The Wally Hayward medal, named after five-time winner Wally Hayward, was added in 2007 for runners finishing in under 6hrs, but outside the gold medals. Often there are fewer runners earning a Wally Hayward medal than those earning a gold medal, if any at all.

- In 2005 the back-to-back medal was created and henceforth was awarded to novice runners who complete an &#x27;up or down run&#x27; in succession. Back-to-back medals were automatically awarded to 2005 Comrades Marathon finishers who had completed their first Comrades Marathon in 2004. As with any new innovation, the award was never intended to be retrospective, owing to administrative restrictions. However, in response to popular demand, the back-to-back medal is available for purchase to runners who have previously fulfilled the criteria of completing both an &#x27;up&#x27; and a &#x27;down&#x27; Comrades Marathon.

- For 2019 the Isavel Roche-Kelly medal (the same design as the Wally Hayward medal) was introduced for women finishing outside the gold medals, but under 7hrs 30min, effectively eliminating the silver medal for women. In 2024 the cutoff time was reduced to 7hrs 00min, making a silver medal a possibility again for women runners. Twenty-year old Isavel Roche-Kelly was named the UCT Sportsperson of the Year for 1980. An unknown on the athletics scene, Roche-Kelly set the roads alight that year when she became the first woman to break the 7-hour barrier and win the Comrades Marathon in 7:18:00; well under the silver-medal cut-off of 7:30:00, and in the process shattering the women&#x27;s record by more than an hour. Earlier that year she also became only the third women in Africa to complete a marathon in under three hours. She went on to win the 1981 Comrades up run in a time of 6:44:35 the following year. Three years later she died in a cycling accident in her native Northern Ireland at the age of 24.

- Also in 2019, the titanium Robert Mtshali medal was introduced for a time between 9hrs 00min and sub 10hrs 00min. Robert Mtshali was the first unofficial black runner in the 1935 Comrades Marathon, finishing his race in a time of 9 hours and 30 minutes. His efforts were not officially recorded as government and race rules of the time stipulated that, in order to compete in the Comrades Marathon, you had to be a white male. Friday, 24 May 1935, saw Mtshali participating in the 15th Comrades Marathon, a down run, joining the 48 official entrants on the starting line. He ran unofficially, but was warmly welcomed into the Durban finish venue on the then Old Fort Road track grounds (now KE Masinga Road) by the crowds of supporters and spectators. The maverick runner clocked his time of 9:30 and was awarded a special presentation by Councillor V.L. Shearer. He was one of only 35 finishers.

==History==
The Comrades was run for the first time on 24 May 1921 (Empire Day), and with the exception of a break during World War II, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic-impacted 2020 and 2021, has been run every year since. To date, over 300,000 runners have completed the race.

The race was the idea of World War I veteran Vic Clapham, to commemorate the South African soldiers killed during the war. Clapham, who had endured a 2,700-kilometre route march through sweltering German East Africa, wanted the memorial to be a unique test of the physical endurance of the entrants. The constitution of the race states that one of its primary aims is to &quot;celebrate mankind&#x27;s spirit over adversity&quot;. Vic Clapham&#x27;s great-grandson, Antony Clapham, finished the race from 2012 to 2015, earning four Vic Clapham medals.

From 1962 to 1994 the race was run on Republic Day, 31 May. After this public holiday was scrapped in 1995 by the post-apartheid South African government, the race date was changed to Youth Day on 16 June. In 2007, the race organisers (controversially) bowed to political pressure from the ANC Youth League, who felt that the race diverted attention from the significance of Youth Day, and changed the race date to Sunday 17 June for 2007 and 15 June for 2008. In 2009 and 2010 the date was changed (to 24 May and 30 May respectively) to accommodate football&#x27;s Confederations Cup (2009) and World Cup (2010) in South Africa. In 2020 and 2021, the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

===1920s===
Forty-eight runners entered the first race in 1921, but only thirty-four elected to start. Most of them were former infantrymen. The course at the time was tarred only for the final few kilometres into Durban. A time limit of 12 hours was set and Bill Rowan became the inaugural winner, clocking 08:59 to win by 41 minutes ahead of Harry Phillips. Of the 34 starters, only 16 completed the race.

Arthur Newton entered and won the race for the first time in 1922. He went on to win the race five times and emerge as the dominant Comrades runner of the 1920s. When he completed the down run in 06:56 in 1923, there were only a handful of spectators on hand to witness the finish because so few thought it possible that the race could be run so quickly. The first woman to run the race was Frances Hayward in 1923, but her entry was refused, so she was an unofficial entrant. She completed the event in 11:35 and although she was not awarded a Comrades medal, the other runners and spectators presented her with a silver tea service and a rose bowl. In 1924 the Comrades had its fewest starters ever, just 24. Four years later, in 1928, the time limit for the race was reduced by an hour to 11 hours.

===1930s===

In the 1930s, Hardy Ballington emerged as the dominant runner, recording four victories in 1933, 1934, 1936 and 1938. The winner of the 1930 race, Wally Hayward, became one of the greatest legends of the Comrades Marathon, winning a further four times in the fifties, and becoming the oldest man to complete the race in 1989. In 1932 Geraldine Watson, an unofficial entrant, became the first woman to complete both the up run and the down run.

===1940s===
After Ballington&#x27;s domination of the 1930s, Comrades was stopped during the war years from 1941 to 1945. In 1948 a Comrades tradition was born when race official Max Trimborn, instead of firing the customary starter&#x27;s gun, gave a loud imitation of a cock&#x27;s crow. That tradition continues to the present day with Trimborn&#x27;s recorded voice played over loudspeakers at the starting line.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, a full twenty years after he won the race for the first time, Wally Hayward recorded his second victory and followed that up with wins in 1951, 1953 and 1954. He represented South Africa at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, where he finished tenth in the marathon. Hayward retired from the Comrades after establishing new records for both the up and down runs and equalling the five wins of Newton and Ballington. In 1958, the race was won for the first time by Jackie Mekler, who went on to win the race five times, finishing second twice and third twice.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Comrades grew considerably, from 104 starters in 1960 to 703 starters in 1969. Due to the bigger fields, cut-off points were introduced at Drummond and Cato Ridge. Mekler became the first man to break the six-hour barrier in 1960, finishing in 5:56:32. The 1961 winner was George Claassen, a school principal and father of well-known Wynand Claassen, Springbok rugby captain during 1981–83. Claassen junior also finished the Comrades ten times in later years.

In 1962, the race attracted foreign entries for the first time as the Road Runners Club of England sent over four of the best long-distance runners in Britain. English runner John Smith won the race, an up run, in under six hours, missing out on the course record by 33 seconds. Watching the stragglers come in hours later, Smith commented to former winner Bill Cochrane that the other people completing the race were getting as much applause as he had received. &quot;You are now witnessing the spirit of the Comrades,&quot; replied Cochrane.

In 1965, English runner Bernard Gomersall broke Mekler&#x27;s down run record with a time of 5:51:09.

In 1967, Manie Kuhn and Tommy Malone were involved in the closest finish in the history of the race. Malone appeared to be on his way to a comfortable win and was handed the traditional message from the Mayor of Pietermaritzburg to the Mayor of Durban at Tollgate with a lead of two minutes over Kuhn. He entered the stadium in the lead with only 80 metres left to go. Suddenly Kuhn appeared only 15 metres behind and closed in quickly. Malone put in a burst for the line, but with only 15 metres left he fell to the ground with cramps. He attempted to get up again, but with the line within reach Kuhn flew past to grab victory. The mayoral message was forgotten as both runners embraced.

===1970s===
The Comrades had over 1,000 starters for the first time in 1971, with over 3,000 in 1979. The race was widely broadcast on both radio and television. The race was opened to all athletes for the first time in 1975, allowing blacks and women to take part officially. In 1975, the Golden Jubilee of the Comrades, Vincent Rakabele finished 20th to become the first black runner to officially win a medal. Elizabeth Cavanaugh became the first women&#x27;s winner in a shade over 10 hours.

1976 saw the emergence of Alan Robb, who won the first of his four Comrades titles. Robb repeated his win in 1977, 1978 and 1980, including breaking the tape in Durban in 1978 in a record 5:29:14, almost 20 minutes and four kilometres ahead of runner-up Dave Wright.

===1980s===

During the 1980s the Comrades began with a field of 4,207 in 1980 and topped 5,000 for the first time in 1983.

In 1980, Olive Anthony became the first black woman finisher of the race in 9:10. She ran the race 22 times, including in 1983 while she was three months pregnant and also in 2010 with her husband and two daughters.

In 1981, University of the Witwatersrand student Bruce Fordyce won the first of his eventual nine Comrades titles. An outspoken critic of apartheid, Fordyce and a number of other athletes initially decided to boycott the 1981 event when organisers announced that they would associate it with the 20th anniversary of the Republic of South Africa. Fordyce ultimately competed wearing a black armband to signal his protest. He repeated his victories in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 (a record 5:24:07 down run), 1987, 1988 (a record 5:27:42 for the up run), and 1990.

In 1989, Sam Tshabalala became the first black winner of the Comrades.

Schoolteacher Frith van der Merwe won the woman&#x27;s race in 1988 in a time of 6:32:56. In 1989, Van der Merwe ran 5:54:43, obliterating the women&#x27;s record and finishing fifteenth overall.

In the same year Wally Hayward entered the race at the age of 79 and finished in 9:44:15. He repeated the feat in the 1989 Comrades, where he completed the race with only two minutes to spare and at the age of 80 became the oldest man to complete the Comrades.

===1990s===

During the 1990s the size of the starting fields was in the region of 12,000 to 14,000 runners. In 1995 prize money was introduced, attracting more foreign competitors. The traditional race day of 31 May, formerly Republic Day, was changed to 16 June, the anniversary of the Soweto uprising.

In 1992 Charl Mattheus, crossed the finish line first, but was later disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance. He claimed it was contained in medicine he had taken for a sore throat, but Jetman Msutu was elevated to the winner, thus becoming the second black winner of the Comrades. In a sad twist for Mattheus, not long after the 1992 race, the substance for which he was banned was removed from the World Athletics&#x27; banned substance list since all evidence pointed to it having no performance enhancing properties. Mattheus also suffered much negativity in the public eye but later managed to redeem his clean image with an emphatic faultless win in the 1997 down run beating a strong local and international field.

===2000s===
The 75th anniversary of the Comrades Marathon in 2000 was the largest ever staged, with a massive field of 23,961. An extra hour was allowed to allow runners some recovery time for bronze medal finishers to celebrate the milestone. In 2010, on its 85th anniversary, the race gained a place in the Guinness World Records as the ultramarathon with most runners. 14,343 athletes, the largest field since the turn of the millennium, finished in the allowed 12 hours.

Russian runner Leonid Shvetsov set both down and up course records in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Stephen Muzhingi became the first non-South African winner from Africa in 2009.

=== 2010s ===

Russian identical twin sisters Olesya and Elena Nurgalieva won a combined ten Comrades titles from 2003 to 2013. Stephen Muzhingi also became the first athlete to win three races in a row (2009, 2010 and 2011) since Bruce Fordyce won three in a row in the eighties (1981, 1982 and 1983).

South African supremacy over the men&#x27;s race was restored when Ludwick Mamabolo won the down run in 2012. David Gatebe shattered the men&#x27;s down record in 2016, while Bongmusa Mthembu has won three titles. Among the women, the Nurgalieva twins&#x27; hold on the race was finally broken in 2014 when Ellie Greenwood, GBR, won the down run after a spectacular finish, taking the lead just 2 km before the end. In 2015 Caroline Wostmann became the first South African woman to win Comrades in 17 years, followed by Charné Bosman in 2016 and Ann Ashworth in 2018. In 2017, American Camille Herron, led from start-to-finish to become only the 3rd American and first in 20 years to win.

=== 2020s ===

The 2020 in-person edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with foreign registrants given the option of transferring their entry to 2021 or 2022. Similarly, the 2021 in-person edition of the race was also cancelled due to the pandemic.

The 2022 Comrades down run was the first in-person event following the Covid-19 pandemic. It was the 95th event since its inception in 1921, and the apt event slogan was &quot;The Return – Sishay&#x27; Ibuya&quot;. Legislation concerning mass participation events limited the number of entrants to 15,000, and preference was given to those who had entered the cancelled 2020 race. The KwaZulu-Natal Sports Department confirmed that 2 athletes died following the race.
==Health issues==
As with every ultramarathon, there are potentially lethal health risks involved in extreme physical events. In the history of the Comrades, there have been 8 deaths up to the 2022 event. In a survey among a sample of 2005 participants, 25% reported cramps, 18% nausea, 8% vomiting, 13% dizziness, 3% diarrhoea, 23% pain, excluding the expected sore legs, and 14% reported fatigue of such a nature that they believed themselves to be incapable of continuing the race. Among silver medalists there was a higher incidence of cramps (42.9%), nausea (21.4%) and diarrhoea (7.1%), though a lower incidence of pain and fatigue than the average runner.

==Cheating in the race==
In 1993, Herman Matthee, a runner from Bellville athletics club, finished in 7th place and was one of the top ten gold medal winners, but he was later stripped of his gold medal and disqualified when video evidence and eyewitness testimony indicated that he entered the race at Kloof and completed less than 30 km of the 89 km down run. Consequently, in a Comrades first, 11th-place finisher Simon Williamson was months later promoted to tenth place and awarded the last gold medal by the then South African president FW de Klerk. Williamson had passed another runner, Ephraim Sekothlong, in the last 100 metres to claim 11th spot and, unknowingly, a gold medal.

In 1999, the Motsoeneng brothers from Bethlehem, Free State, who strongly resembled one another, performed an act of cheating during another down run. By exchanging places with his brother at toilet stops and aided by car lifts at various stages, Sergio Motsoeneng finished ninth, which came as a surprise to Nick Bester and other athletes behind him, who could not recall being overtaken. They were exposed when television footage revealed them to be wearing watches on different arms, and a time pad reading that confirmed that one of the brothers was still trailing Bester at Botha&#x27;s Hill. The brothers performed well in later years, though Sergio tested positive for a banned substance after finishing third in 2010.

Use of banned substances is claimed to be endemic among top Comrades athletes, but only a small number have been disqualified. Runners who have tested positive include Sergio Motsoeneng, Rasta Mohloli, Viktor Zhdanov, Lephetesang Adoro and Ludwick Mamabolo. Mamabolo was found not guilty due to &quot;technical irregularities&quot;. Erythropoietin (EPO), norandrosterone (a metabolite or precursor of nandrolone), methylhexaneamine and testosterone have been mentioned in connection with Comrades athletes.

In 2014, an analysis of negative splits by runner and statistician Mark Dowdeswell, suggested that a number of runners in the middle to back half of the field may be taking shortcuts.

===Multiple winners===
&#x27;+&#x27; denotes winner of both an up and a down run

===Most gold medals===
Gold medals were first awarded in 1931, and to the first 6 male finishers. In 1972, this was extended to the first 10 male finishers, as it is today. In 1983 a gold medal was awarded to the female winner for the first time. In 1988, this was extended to the first 3 female finishers, then to the first 5 female finishers from 1995, and from 1998 onward to the first 10 female finishers, on par with the male race.

The following runners won 7 or more gold medals, gold medal span in brackets, race winners in bold:

===Most top 10 finishes by women===
The following women have finished in the top 10 of the women&#x27;s race on 7 or more occasions in the race history. Given the top 10 women only received gold medals from 1998, the gold medals list doesn&#x27;t fully reflect the history of the women&#x27;s race as female contenders in the 1980s and early 90s were competing for fewer gold medals relative to the men.

==== 13 top ten ====

 Elena Nurgalieva (2003–2015)

===International (non-African) gold medallists=== 
As the race is the pinnacle of the South African distance running calendar with local elite athletes targeting the event year-after-year there are fewer international gold medalists. World class international athletes may target the Comrades from time to time but not on a consistent basis like South African athletes. Achieving even a single gold medal for an international athlete is a significant achievement overcoming local athletes in their premier event. The following non-African international runners have won 2 or more gold medals (winners in bold):

====Men====
===== 7 medals =====
 Oleg Kharitonov (2002–2008)

 Vladimir Kotov (2000–2008)

===Most Wally Hayward medals===
The following have won 3 or more Wally Hayward medals (for running sub-6 hours, but outside the top 10) since the medal was first awarded in 2007, medal span in brackets.

====5 medals====
 Mike Fokoroni (2012–2023)

 Charles Dibate Tjiane (2012–2018)

 Teboho Sello (2012–2022)

 Renier Grobler (2016–2024)

===Oldest finisher===
* Marosi Johannes Mosehla – 2024, 82 years in a time of 10:13.46 and 2023, 81 years in 9:26:09.
* Wally Hayward – 1989, 80 years. In 1954, winning Comrades for the fifth time, Hayward also was the oldest runner on the day, at the age of 45.

=== Permanent green numbers ===
When a runner completes their 10th Comrades (or achieves either 5 gold medals or 3 wins) they attain their green number and keep their race number for life, the race number effectively being &#x27;retired&#x27; only for use by that athlete. The first time a number is awarded it will be flanked by single laurels. After 20 years a double green number with double laurels is earned, followed by another laurel every next 10 years. A 3-time winner or 5 gold qualifier will not get a second green until they reach 20. The race number may subsequently only be inherited by family members.

The following are holders (either earned or inherited) of race numbers 1 to 10:

 Clive Crawley – 42 medals (1957–2000) (1 , 22 , 19 )

 Wally Hayward – 5 wins/7 medals (1930–1989) (4 , 1 , 2 ) / Steven Bure – 3 medals (2015–2018) (1 , 3 Bill Rowan)

 Allen Bodill – 10 medals (1947–1968) (10 ) / Myles Bodill – 2 medals (1989–1994) (2 )

 Nick Raubenheimber – 22 medals (1953–1975) (6 , 13 , 3 ) / Graham Raubenheimer – 11 medals (1980–1995) (4 , 6 ) / Blake Raubenheimer – 10 medals (2005–2017) (9 , 1 Bill Rowan)

 Allan Ferguson – 36 medals (1948–1995) (3 , 12 , 21 )

 John Woods – 11 medals (1952–1979) (1 , 8 , 2 )

 Malcolm Hean – 14 medals (1962–1976) (9 , 5 )

 unknown/not allocated – according to results it was used in 1922 by a &#x27;Boyle&#x27;, thereafter by 7 different individuals, the final being a &#x27;Natasha Williams&#x27; in 1995.

 Jackie Mekler – 5 wins/12 medals (1952–1985) (10 , 1 , 1 )

 Fred Morrison – 11 medals (1938–1966) (2 , 9 )

===Most medals – Green number records===

====Male quadruple green numbers====

No female runner has achieved a quadruple green number yet.

===Female triple green numbers===

===International triple/double green numbers===

 John Sneddon, 30 medals (1993-2024)

 Klaus Neumann, 28 medals (1993-2023)

 Tiago Dionisio, 22 medals (2001-2024)

==First South African==

As the race has grown in profile globally, and since the end of sporting isolation, international runners have come to dominate the race for periods of time. As a result, the first South African home each year is also now awarded a separate prize.

==Medals and demographics==
There is a lot of prestige associated with a Comrades Marathon Green Number. As a result, many athletes aim to complete at least 10 races, which is evident as a clear peak in the distribution of medal counts. The introduction of the back-to-back medal (for running two years in succession) resulted in another peak for athletes with 2 medals.

==Charts==
==Popular culture==
The Long Run was a 2001 film set in 1999, in which a retired running coach trains a woman for the race. &#x27;Comrades&#x27; was a 2008 film about seven diverse runners attempting the race.

<text>Erkki-Sven Tüür (; born 16 October 1959) is an Estonian composer.

==Life and career==
Tüür was born in Kärdla on the Estonian island of Hiiumaa. He studied flute and percussion at the Tallinn Music School from 1976 to 1980 and composition with Jaan Rääts at the Tallinn Academy of Music and privately with Lepo Sumera from 1980 to 1984. From 1979 to 1984 he headed the rock group In Spe, which quickly became one of the most popular in Estonia.

Tüür left In Spe to concentrate on composition, and with the advent of perestroika soon found an audience in the west. The Helsinki Philharmonic, the Hilliard Ensemble, the Stockholm Saxophone Quartet and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are among those who have commissioned works from him.

His Concerto for Viola and Orchestra, entitled &#x27;&quot;Illuminatio&quot;&#x27;, was premiered by violist Lars Anders Tomter and South Jutland Symphony Orchestra in October 2008.

Since 1985, Tüür is member of the Estonian Composers&#x27; Union.

==Style==
Tüür&#x27;s early work is polystylistic. Influencing styles were Rock, Post-Romantic, Minimalism, Gregorian Chant.

His music is characterized by expressive, energetic, organic amalgamation of opposite styles: tonality vs. atonality; repetitive rhythm vs. complex rhythm; meditation vs. explosive power; intellectual vs. emotional. The first pure example is his opus &quot;Oxymoron&quot;.

Tüür developed a vector based voice leading technique. The vectors are sequences of intervals, expressed as numbers. He compares this compositional method with a source code, a germ that grows, or a gene that mutates.

Starting point of the composition process is an abstract drawing, that visualizes the music.

===Tonal===
* Triad
* Linear Polyphony
* Modality

===Atonal===
* Twelve-tone technique
* Tone cluster
* Microtone

==Awards==
Tüür received numerous national awards.

He was awarded the Cultural Prize of Estonia in 1991 and 1996 and the Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science in 1998.

* 2015 Prize of the Christoph and Stephan Kaske Foundation

Tüür&#x27;s works are published by Edition Peters and Fennica Gehrman.

<text>Sarah Baartman is a South African environmental protection vessel—of the Damen Offshore Patrol Vessel 8313 class.
The &quot;Sarah Baartman&quot; was commissioned on 10 January 2005.
Named after Khoikhoi woman, Sarah Baartman, she was built by Damen Group, of the Netherlands, at one of its Romanian shipyards, and was designed to be capable of patrolling South Africa&#x27;s entire EEZ, including the area around the southerly Prince Edward Islands.

On 3 October 2007 the &quot;Sarah Baartman&quot; took custody of two men accused of murdering a fellow crew member of the South African icebreaker &quot;S. A. Agulhas&quot;.

The South African government has been criticized for chartering the &quot;Sarah Baartman&quot; to support offshore oil drilling.

The vessels carry limited equipment for enclosing and skimming oil spills, and fire-fighting water cannons.

<doc id="543929" wikidata="Q3486771" url="?curid=543929" title="Tribal-class frigate">
<text>The Type 81, or Tribal class, frigates were ordered and built as sloops to carry out similar duties to the immediate post war improved s and s in the Persian Gulf. In the mid 1960s the seven Tribals were reclassified as second class general-purpose frigates to maintain frigate numbers. After the British withdrawal from East of Suez in 1971 the Tribals operated in the NATO North Atlantic sphere with the only update the fitting of Seacat missiles to all by 1977, limited by their single propeller and low speed of 24 knots. In 1979–80 age and crew and fuel shortages saw them transferred to the stand-by squadrons; three were reactivated in 1982 during the Falklands War for training and guardship duties in the West Indies.

==History==
The Tribals were designed during the 1950s as a response to the increasing cost of single-role vessels such as the Type 14s. They were first such &#x27;multi role&#x27; vessels for the Royal Navy. They were designed specifically with colonial &#x27;gunboat&#x27; duties in mind, particularly in the Middle East. They were therefore designed to be self-contained warships with weapon and sensor systems to cover many possible engagements, air conditioning to allow extended tropical deployment and such &#x27;modern&#x27; habitability features as all bunk accommodation (as opposed to hammocks). The fitting of gas turbine boost engines was specifically intended to allow the frigates to almost instantly leave ports and naval bases in the event of nuclear war, rather than have to spend four to six hours to flash up the steam boilers. The G6 gas turbine proved reliable and was generally used to leave port during the frigates&#x27; career and paved the way for gas turbine propulsion to become universal in the RN within 30 years.

==Design==
They were the first class of the Royal Navy to be designed from the start to operate a helicopter and the first small escorts to carry a long-range air search radar, the Type 965 with a single &#x27;rake&#x27; AKE-1 antenna. They were armed with two QF 4.5-in (113 mm) Mark 5 guns salvaged from scrapped Second World War destroyers. Although these mountings were refurbished with Remote Power Control (RPC) operation, they still required manual loading on an exposed open back.

Originally the intended gun armament was two twin Second World War standard mounts, then twin 70 caliber mounts which 256 ton weight for 2 turrets was too heavy. A lighter automatic gun fit of two N(R) single automatic 4-inch guns, as fitted in Chile&#x27;s Almirante-class destroyer 
still required a hull longer and like twin 3/70s, were too expensive.

A 3000-ton displacement exceeded the limit the UK Treasury would allow for a sloop or frigate design in the 1960s so both automatic guns were rejected on account of weight, space and cost. Even though they provided a realistic solution to the RN AA/ DP gun requirement, due to cost, and the problem of cost of developing stocks and logistic support, for new types of ammunition and doubt of the usefulness of medium gun AA against post 1962 jet air and missile targets.

From the outset they were designed to carry the new GWS-21 Seacat anti-aircraft missile system anti-aircraft missile system but all except &quot;Zulu&quot; initially carried single Mark 7 40 mm Bofors guns in lieu. The rest of the class were fitted with Seacat in the 1970s using surplus missile systems, left over from s and refits.

The Tribals were the first modern RN ships designed to use a combination of power sources, a feature which had been trialled with limited success in the 1930s in the minelayer . An additive mix of steam and gas turbine called &quot;COmbined Steam and Gas&quot; COSAG was used. This gave the rapid start-up and acceleration of a gas turbine engine coupled with the cruising efficiency and reliability of the steam turbine. They would cruise on the steam plant and use both systems driving the same shaft for a high-speed &quot;boost&quot;. They suffered however from being single-shaft vessels which severely limited manoeuvrability, acceleration and deceleration. The single screw proved significantly limiting when they were used in the 1970s Cod Wars in terms of manoeuvering in ramming manoeuvres, for and against, Icelandic coast guard cutters. The cramped awkward nature of the helicopter pad and handling provision was also exposed in the 1976 Cod War and was a major reason that some s were given further refits in preference to the Tribals and maintained in higher status reserve in the early 1980s limitations on defence spending.

==Shortcomings==
The costs for the Tribal Class ships escalated above the costs first envisaged and the original order of ships, (over twenty), was cancelled after the first seven ships had been completed. Only four would have been built if it had been possible to cancel the contractual commitments the Royal Navy had entered into for the supply of complex engines and machinery for eight frigates. The ships were rather small, at , which reduced the options for later modernisation and were always going to be limited by their single-shaft propulsion. The class were still good warships in spite of being fitted with outdated guns, (they were described by some as &#x27;guided flagpoles&#x27;) if sometimes capable of 18 rounds per minute for the first two minutes, and proved the usefulness of the general purpose frigate concept and gas turbine propulsion, but the average unit costs of the Type 81s completed in 1963-64 was £500,000 more than the first eight &quot;Leander&quot;s and the final cost of over £5 million of the first Tribal, &quot;Ashanti&quot;, completed in 1961 was considered too high and hence limited the number actually built; the original intent was to build 23 Type 81s. This meant that further 1960s RN frigate development would be based on the more conservative steam-powered Type 12 (&quot;Whitby&quot;) class, subsequently modernised in the Type 12M (&quot;Rothesay&quot;) class and finalised in the excellent Type 12I (&quot;Leander&quot;)-class. The later Royal Navy Type 21 (&quot;Amazon&quot;) class &quot;General Purpose Frigates&quot; were originally envisaged for a similar gunboat role to the Tribal-class ships and to operate East of Suez.

==Service==
The class served throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s fulfilling their designed general purpose &quot;colonial gunboat&quot; role. When change in British foreign policy made this role redundant they found themselves being pressed into service in home waters in the Cod Wars of the 1970s. They were not particularly suited to these duties however, as they had a hull form optimised for the calm, shallow water of the Persian Gulf and with only a single shaft were unable to manoeuvre with the Icelandic patrol vessels at close quarters.

All were decommissioned from the Royal Navy during the mid-to-late 1970s with the manpower crisis also attributing to the rapid removal of the class from service. They were however given a brief reprieve by the Falklands War, with 3 mothballed Tribals (&quot;Gurkha&quot;, &quot;Tartar&quot; and &quot;Zulu&quot;) being reactivated to cover ships deployed to the South Atlantic or undergoing long-term repairs after the conflict. The remaining units were cannibalised for spare parts to enable the 3 ships to be refitted. These ships were sold in 1984 to Indonesia.

==Ships==
The building costs given above are official figures from the Navy/Defence Estimates. Note that &quot;Janes Fighting Ships&quot; quotes a slightly lower cost for &quot;Ashanti&quot; of £5,220,000, as against £5,315,000 quoted in the &quot;1962-63 Navy Estimates&quot;.
