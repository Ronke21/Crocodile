<doc id="535978" wikidata="Q217260" url="?curid=535978" title="Tommi Mäkinen">
<text>Tommi Antero Mäkinen (; born 26 June 1964) is a Finnish racing executive and former rally driver.

Mäkinen is one of the most successful World Rally drivers of all time, ranking fifth in rally wins (24) and third in championships (4), tied with Juha Kankkunen behind Sébastien Ogier (8) and Sébastien Loeb (9). In 2018, as a head of Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT, he became the first person in the history of rally driving to win a Championship both as a driver and as a team principal.

He is a four-time World Rally Champion, a series he first won, and then successfully defended, continuously throughout 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, on all occasions driving the Ralliart Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. He also aided Mitsubishi to the 1998 world constructors&#x27; title as well as winning the 2000 Race of Champions. Mäkinen&#x27;s navigators include compatriots Seppo Harjanne, Kaj Lindström and Risto Mannisenmäki, the former retiring from alongside Mäkinen having previously served 1985 champion, and fellow &quot;Flying Finn&quot;, Peugeot&#x27;s Timo Salonen.

==Career==

Mäkinen won the Group N Finnish Rally Championship driving a Lancia Delta HF 4WD in 1988. Mäkinen&#x27;s first world rally win came on the 1994 1000 Lakes Rally (now Rally Finland), in a Ford Escort RS Cosworth. Mäkinen proved a late developer by the standards of some in rallying circles, only nabbing his first full-time manufacturer seat in a Group A formula Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution alongside former Group A rally champion Swede Kenneth Eriksson, in 1995 - but success was to prove spontaneous thereafter.

A cultured Safari Rally win in 1996 proved the platform on which to build a dominant championship lead, which he consolidated by taking the title in Australia, away from runner-up, Subaru&#x27;s Colin McRae - a long-time rival. He proceeded to win every drivers&#x27; title for Mitsubishi from 1996 to 1999. The Mitsubishi team, with the Finn and young Briton Richard Burns among its driver personnel, also won its sole manufacturers&#x27; championship in 1998, while late that same year, the licensed Tommi Mäkinen Rally video game was also released. In 2000, despite opening his campaign with victory on the January Monte Carlo Rally, Mäkinen finally relinquished his grasp on the title, being beaten in the standings by new title holder and fellow Finn, Marcus Grönholm. That year Mitsubishi produced a &#x27;Tommi Mäkinen edition&#x27; of the road version of the Lancer Evolution VI to commemorate his previous title successes. This car had a different front bumper than the regular Evolution VI, while some models also featured a red and white paint job to closely resemble Mäkinen&#x27;s rally car.
Mäkinen remained with Mitsubishi until the end of the 2001 season, having finished third in that year&#x27;s standings behind Burns and McRae, by now respectively drivers for Subaru and Ford - but not before the inauspicious introduction of team&#x27;s first ever World Rally Car on the San Remo Rally. Mäkinen and teammate Freddy Loix struggled with the car before the Finn&#x27;s crash on the mountainside roads of the following round in Corsica was responsible for breaking co-driver Mannisenmäki&#x27;s back and in doing so, virtually ended his top-line career. The Finn was forced to fare with substitute co-drivers for the remaining events in Australia (with Timo Hantunen) and Great Britain, the latter of which he retired from, helping Burns to claim the championship.
A move to the Prodrive-run Subaru World Rally Team for 2002 as replacement for Burns (who had chosen to drive a works Peugeot 206 WRC alongside Grönholm for his title defence) yielded one more, final career victory, on the 2002 Monte Carlo Rally where a technical infringement committed by on-the-road winner, and emerging talent, Sébastien Loeb, allowed Mäkinen to upstage the Frenchman. But his form then took a dive and he was not to add again to his tally of world titles.

He retired from the sport after the 2003 season, ending his WRC career on the podium with third place on that seasons final rally, Rally Great Britain.

In 2004 he established his own company named &quot;Tommi Mäkinen Racing Oy Ltd&quot; with the aim to prepare rally cars and provide support to drivers.

In 2016, Mäkinen became the team principal of the Toyota Gazoo Racing, which is the factory team of Toyota and competes in the World Rally Championship (WRC). In 2018, the team managed to win the World Rally Championship earning Toyota their first manufacturers&#x27; title since 1999.

==Personal life==
Mäkinen was born in Puuppola, near Jyväskylä, Finland. From 1999, he has lived in both Jyväskylä and Monte Carlo, Monaco. He is married, with two children.

<text>Hysterical Blindness is a 2002 American television drama film directed by Mira Nair and written by Laura Cahill, based on her stage play of the same name. It stars Gena Rowlands, Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis, and Ben Gazzara. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 16, 2002, and aired on HBO on August 21, 2002. In 2003, Uma Thurman won a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Debby Miller. Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands also won Best Supporting Actor/Actress awards for their performances as Virginia Miller and Nick Piccolo at the 2003 Emmy Awards. The opening titles by Trollbäck + Company won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2003.

Thurman plays an excitable New Jersey woman searching for romance in the 1980s. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; review wrote: &quot;Thurman so commits herself to the role, eyes blazing and body akimbo, that you start to believe that such a creature could exist — an exquisite looking woman so spastic and needy that she repulses regular Joes. Thurman has bent the role to her will.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1987 in Bayonne, New Jersey, Debby Miller has been diagnosed with the condition hysterical blindness in which there are times when her sight fades in and out. The doctor tells her to try to have fun with her friends. She and her best friend Beth go to their favorite bar, Ollie&#x27;s, and try to find a man and have a drink. Beth flirts with the bartender, and Debby grows angry with her and goes outside where she meets Rick. He wants little to do with her, but she convinces him to escort her to her car. As a &#x27;thank you,&#x27; she offers to buy him a drink and tells him that she will be at the same bar tomorrow.

The next day, they see each other at Ollie&#x27;s, and she asks him to go somewhere else; eventually they are at his house. It is clear that Rick has little interest in Debby, so to move things along, she tells him that she &#x27;gives a great blow job.&#x27; Afterward, she thinks she has found love, but Rick is only looking for a one-night stand. Debby goes home.

Her mother Virginia has been dating an older man, Nick, who wants her to move with him to Florida. However, Nick dies from a heart attack. Virginia realizes that until she met Nick, she lived her life, waiting for things to happen to her. In the end, Debby, Beth and Virginia struggle to find stability and agree that all they need is each other.

== Critical reception ==
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; has an approval rating of 75% based on 12 critics&#x27; reviews.

The film received acclaim for its performances, particularly that of Thurman, Rowlands, Lewis, and Gazzara. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Beneath big hair, tight clothes and thick New Jersey accents, [Thurman and Lewis] bring enormous empathy to their roles in this small-scale, beautifully made character study about two best friends in their 20s.&quot; James also praised the direction of Mira Nair, saying she brings to the film &quot;a quality that has been consistent throughout her career: a strong feel for the texture of a life and the people who struggle through it.&quot; Chris Gore of &quot;Film Threat&quot; said Thurman and Lewis &quot;give what can easily be considered career-best performances.&quot; In more critical reviews, the plot was criticized as &quot;too thin&quot; and the cast &quot;far superior to the film itself.&quot;

<text>A charity shop(British English), thrift shop or thrift store (American English and Canadian English, also includes for-profit stores such as Savers) or opportunity shop or op-shop (Australian English and New Zealand English) is a retail establishment run by a charitable organization to raise money. Charity shops are a type of social enterprise. They sell mainly used goods such as clothing, books, music albums, shoes, toys, and furniture donated by the public, and are often staffed by volunteers. Because the items for sale were obtained for free, and business costs are low, the items can be sold at competitive prices. After costs are paid, all remaining income from the sales is used in accord with the organization&#x27;s stated charitable purpose. Costs include purchase and/or depreciation of fixtures (clothing racks, bookshelves, counters, etc.), operating costs (maintenance, municipal service fees, electricity, heat, telephone, limited advertising) and the building lease or mortgage.

==Terminology==
Charity shops may also be referred to as thrift stores (in the United States and Canada), hospice shops, resale shops (a term that in the United States also covers consignment shops), opportunity (or op) shops (in Australia and New Zealand), and second-hands (секонд-хенды) in Russia.

==History==
One of the earliest known charity shops in the United Kingdom was set up by the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind (now called the Beacon Centre for the Blind) in 1899 to sell goods made by blind people to raise money for the Society. During World War I, various fund-raising activities occurred, such as a charity bazaar in Shepherd Market, London, which made £50,000 for the Red Cross.

However, it was during the Second World War that the charity shop became widespread. Edinburgh University Settlement opened their &quot;Thrift Shop for Everyone&quot; in Edinburgh in 1937, the Red Cross opened up its first charity shop at 17 Old Bond Street, London in 1941. For the duration of the war, over two hundred &quot;permanent&quot; Red Cross gift shops and about 150 temporary Red Cross shops were opened. A condition of the shop licence issued by the Board of Trade was that all goods offered for sale were gifts. Purchase for re-sale was forbidden. The entire proceeds from sales had to be passed to the Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s Red Cross or the St John Fund. Most premises were lent free of rent and in some cases owners also met the costs of heating and lighting.

The first Oxfam charity shop in the United Kingdom was established by Cecil Jackson-Cole in Broad Street, Oxford, and began trading in December 1947.

==Popularity==

In the early 2010s, shopping at a charity shop became popular enough to earn a name in the United States: &quot;thrifting&quot;. Environmentalists may prefer buying second-hand goods as this uses fewer natural resources and would usually do less damage to the environment than by buying new goods would, in part because the goods are usually collected locally. In addition, reusing second-hand items is a form of recycling, and thus reduces the amount of waste going to landfill sites. People who oppose sweatshops often purchase second-hand clothing as an alternative to supporting clothing companies with dubious ethical practices. People who desire authentic vintage clothing typically shop at charity shops since most clothing that is donated is old and/or out of normal fashion (often from a recently deceased person who had not updated their clothing for a long time). Many YouTube channels make thrifting videos showcasing fashionable and unusual finds.

Second-hand goods are considered to be quite safe. The South Australian Public Health Directorate says that the health risk of buying used clothing is very low. It explains that washing purchased items in hot water is just one of several ways to eliminate the risk of contracting infectious diseases.

Charity shops also tend to be relatively inexpensive which has led to an increase in their popularity during the United Kingdom cost of living crisis. Another reason for charity shop popularity is the chance to occasionally find rare or collectible items at these stores.

==Sale of new goods==
Some charity shops, such as PDSA, also sell a range of new goods which may be branded to the charity, or have some connection with the cause the charity supports. Oxfam stores, for example, sell fair trade food and crafts. Charity shops may receive overstock or obsolete goods from local for-profit businesses; the for-profit businesses benefit by taking a tax write-off and clearing unwanted goods from their store instead of throwing the goods out, which is costly.

==Charity shops by region==
===Australia===

In Australia, major national opportunity shop chains include the St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store (trading as Vinnies) which operate 650 shops across Australia, Anglicare Shops, that currently operate in 19 locations across Sydney and the Illawarra also various locations around Australia, the Salvation Army (trading as Salvos), the Red Cross, MS Research Australia, and the Brotherhood of St. Laurence. Many local charitable organisations, both religious and secular, run opportunity shops. Common among these are missions and animal shelters.

=== Canada ===
The Mennonite Central Committee operates 85 thrift stores in Canada and United States. Beginning in 1972, the first MCC Thrift Store opened in Altona, Manitoba.

=== Denmark ===
Most of the charity shops in Denmark are operated by either The Danish Red Cross or by Christian organizations. The Danish Red Cross has 250 shops in the country and 10,000 volunteers working in the shops. DanChurchAid has since 1972 operated charity shops, and currently operates 114 shops. The Blue Cross, founded as a Christian organization, runs 55 charity shops in the country, and focuses mainly on helping alcoholics, addicts and other socially marginalized groups.

A study from 2019 shows that danes on average had spent 5.475 kr. on second-hand items the last 12 months, and that 77% of danes had either shopped or sold second-hand, although the study was not exclusive to charity shops.
===New Zealand===
A large variety of op-shops exist throughout New Zealand. Some are secular and some belong to religious organisations. Charities include St Vincent de Pauls (Vinnies), 60+ shops; The Salvation Army (Sallies), 112+ shops; The Red Cross, 53 shops; Opportunity for Animals, 2 shops; The SPCA, 24 shops; Orphan&#x27;s Aid, 7 shops; and Hospice Shops, 125+ shops.

The term &quot;op-shop&quot; is often used to mean any second-hand shop regardless of its charitable status.

===United Kingdom===

Oxfam has the largest number of charity shops in the UK with over 600 shops. Many Oxfam shops also sell books, and the organization now operates over 70 specialist Oxfam Bookshops, making them the largest retailer of second-hand books in the United Kingdom. Other Oxfam affiliates also have shops, such as Jersey, Germany, Ireland (45 shops in NI/ROI), the Netherlands and Hong Kong. Other charities with a strong presence on high streets in the UK include The Children&#x27;s Society, YMCA, British Heart Foundation, Barnardos, Cancer Research UK, Shelter, Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, Age UK (formerly Age Concern and Help the Aged), Marie Curie Cancer Care, Norwood, Save the Children, Scope, PDSA, Naomi House Children&#x27;s Hospice and Sue Ryder Care. Many local hospices also operate charity shops to raise funds.

There are over 9,000 charity shops in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Their locations can be found on the Charity Retail Association (CRA) website, along with information on charity retail, what shops can and can&#x27;t accept, etc. The CRA is a member organisation for charities which run shops. British charity shops are mainly staffed by unpaid volunteers, with a paid shop manager. Goods for sale are predominantly from donations – 87% according to the official estimate. Donations should be taken directly to a charity shop during opening hours, as goods left on the street may be stolen or damaged by passers-by or inclement weather. In expensive areas, donations include a proportion of good quality designer clothing and charity shops in these areas are sought out for cut-price fashions. &#x27;Standard&#x27; charity shops sell a mix of clothing, books, toys, videos, DVDs, music (like CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl) and bric-a-brac (like cutlery and ornaments). Some shops specialise in certain areas, like vintage clothing, furniture, electrical items, or records.

The two largest charity shops in the UK are run by Emmaus. Emmaus Preston store opened in 2016 is on one level and covers 47,000 square feet and Emmaus in Rochdale operate a three floor Department Store since January 2019 which offers the department store feel to the charity store. These stores are run by Emmaus Companions and the money they generate directly benefit the people who work in it. Both stores sell predominantly furniture and white goods but include smaller concessions of clothes, bric-a-brac, books and music.

Almost all charity shops sell on their unsold textiles (i.e. unfashionable, stained or damaged fabric) to textile processors. Each charity shop saves an average of 40 tonnes of textiles every year, by selling them in the shop, or passing them on to these textile merchants for recycling or reuse. This grosses to around 363,000 tonnes across all charity shops in the UK; based on 2010 landfill tax value at £48 per tonne, the value of textiles reused or passed for recycling by charity shops in terms of savings in landfill tax is £17,424,000 p.a. Gift Aid is a UK tax incentive for individual donors where, subject to a signed declaration being held by the charity, income tax paid on donations can be reclaimed by the charity. Although initially intended only for cash donations, the scheme now (since 2006) allows tax on the income earned by charity shops acting as agent for the donor to be reclaimed.

Charity shops in the UK get mandatory 80% relief on business rates on their premises, which is funded by central government (not by local ratepayers) and is one illustration of their support for the charity sector and the role of charity shops in raising funds for charities. Charities can apply for discretionary relief on the remaining 20%, which is an occasional source of criticism from retailers which have to pay in full.

==== Largest charity retailers ====
The Charity Shops Survey 2017 revealed the ten largest charity retailers in the UK based on annual income and number of stores.
===United States===

In the United States, major national thrift shop operators include Goodwill Industries, Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store, and ReStore (operated by Habitat for Humanity). Value Village/Savers, while looking like a thrift store and selling donated goods, is actually a private, for-profit company. Regional operators include Deseret Industries in the Western United States, and those run by AbleLight in the Upper Midwest. Many local charitable organizations, both religious and secular, operate thrift stores. Common among these are missions, children&#x27;s homes, homeless shelters, and animal shelters. In addition, some thrift stores are operated by churches as fundraising venues that support activities and missionary work.

<doc id="535992" wikidata="Q3519293" url="?curid=535992" title="Tevita Momoedonu">
<text>Ratu Tevita Momoedonu (13 January 1946 – 26 November 2020) was a Fijian politician who served as the fifth Prime Minister of Fiji twice – each time extremely briefly. Both appointments were to get around constitutional technicalities; his first term of office – on 27 May 2000 lasted only a few minutes. His second term – from 14 to 16 March 2001 was for two days. He subsequently served his country as Ambassador of Fiji to Japan. Using his chiefly title of &quot;Taukei Sawaieke&quot;, he later led pushed for the Yasana of Ba to secede from the Burebasaga and Kubuna Confederacies to form their own fourth confederacy under the &quot;Tui Vuda&quot;, &quot;Ratu&quot; Josefa Iloilo, who died in 2011.

== First appointment ==
In 1999, Momoedonu had been elected on the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) ticket to represent the Vuda Open Constituency in the House of Representatives, and subsequently appointed to the Cabinet. He was the only minister not present in the Parliament building when George Speight stormed the complex on 19 May 2000, taking Chaudhry and other government members hostage and staging a coup d&#x27;état. The President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, wanted to assume emergency powers to deal with the situation, but was unable to do so, because constitutionally, the President is not allowed to act except on the advice of the Prime Minister – and Prime Minister Chaudhry, being in captivity, was unable to render such advice. In a move which some legal scholars have questioned as being of doubtful constitutional validity, Mara therefore dismissed Chaudhry and appointed Momoedonu in his place on 27 May, so that Momoedonu could &quot;advise&quot; him to suspend Parliament and assume emergency powers. Upon tendering the requisite advice, Momoedonu promptly resigned. The whole procedure had taken only a few minutes. (The move backfired when, two days later, Mara was himself deposed by the Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, Commodore Frank Bainimarama).

== Interim Minister; second appointment as Prime Minister ==

Momoedonu served as Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations in the interim Cabinet formed by Laisenia Qarase in the midst of the upheaval that followed the coup. He held this position until September 2001.

Momoedonu&#x27;s second appointment as Prime Minister, on 14 March 2001, came in the wake of an Appeal Court verdict that the interim government of President Josefa Iloilo and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, both of whom had taken office when the coup had been put down, was unconstitutional, and ordered that the previous government be reinstated. That would mean reinstating Ratu Mara as president or else convening the Great Council of Chiefs to elect a new president. Mara moved to spare the country further constitutional trauma by resigning officially, retroactive to 29 May 2000 (the day on which he had been deposed), thereby validating the Iloilo regime, which was duly affirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The court verdict was also widely interpreted to mean that Mahendra Chaudhry should be reinstated as Prime Minister, but President Iloilo disagreed. He argued that defections from Chaudhry&#x27;s Labour Party meant that he no longer had majority support in the House of Representatives, and therefore the President was not obliged to appoint him.

Iloilo had apparently decided already that the best way forward for Fiji was to take the question of the country&#x27;s leadership back to the people, but he could not constitutionally call an early election except on the advice of the Prime Minister – advice that he was sure Chaudhry would refuse to render. He therefore appointed Momoedonu. There was a legal argument, albeit a flimsy one, that as the last &quot;lawfully appointed&quot; Prime Minister under the last constitutional President, Ratu Mara, Momoedonu should be reappointed. Cynics, including former House of Representatives Speaker Tomasi Vakatora, saw the appointment more as a case of nepotism: Momoedonu was President Iloilo&#x27;s nephew. The appointment, although brief, entitled him to a lifetime pension amounting to 20 percent of the Prime Minister&#x27;s salary.

Momoedonu rendered his formal advice to President Iloilo to dissolve Parliament and call a general election. Mission accomplished, Momoedonu resigned the next day, allowing Laisenia Qarase to resume the office of Prime Minister. In the ensuing election, Qarase was confirmed as Prime Minister when his newly formed Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua won a plurality. Momoedonu, however, stood as a candidate for the House of Representatives on the Bei Kai Viti Party ticket, but was defeated.

== Ambassador to Japan ==

In 2002, Momoedonu was appointed Fiji&#x27;s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Japan, and duly presented his credentials to Emperor Akihito on 7 October that year. His term expired in March 2006, and he returned to Fiji.

== Later career ==

The &quot;Fiji Sun&quot; reported on 12 March 2006 that Momoedonu was being considered as a possible leader for the Party of National Unity (PANU), which was reestablished in early 2006 following its deregistration the previous year, and which absorbed the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) and Momoedonu&#x27;s old BKV in March 2006. This did not eventuate, however, and he entered private sector business as Chairman of Ba Provincial Holdings, Ltd.

<text>USS &quot;Alabama&quot; (SSBN-731) is the sixth nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, and the seventh United States vessel to be named for the state of Alabama. The boat&#x27;s motto duplicates the state&#x27;s motto, &quot;Audemus Jura Nostra Defendere&quot; (&quot;We dare defend our rights&quot;).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for &quot;Alabama&quot;″s construction was awarded on 27 February 1978 and her keel was laid down on 14 October 1980 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics. She was launched on 19 May 1984, sponsored by Mrs. Barbara E. Dickinson, wife of William Louis Dickinson, Representative from Alabama, and commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut, on 25 May 1985.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Alabama&quot; departed Connecticut to conduct her shakedown cruise off the coast of Florida. After several domestic maneuvers and crew changes, &quot;Alabama&quot; visited Mobile, Alabama, before heading for the Panama Canal and from there to Bangor, Washington. &quot;Alabama&quot; operated out of Bangor until mid-May 1986, when she embarked on her first strategic deterrent patrol. Operating from the Pacific Northwest, &quot;Alabama&quot; carried out four deterrent patrols between June and December 1986.

In May 1988, &quot;Alabama&quot; conducted a successful test ballistic missile firing, launching two Trident I C4 ballistic missiles. On 1 September 1988, &quot;Alabama&quot; moored at Bangor to complete her ninth deterrent patrol and the 100th strategic deterrent patrol by a Trident-armed submarine. An official ceremony commemorating the event was held pier-side with then-Undersecretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III heading the official greeting party. &quot;Alabama&quot; conducted another test ballistic missile firing in August 1989, launching four Trident I C4 ballistic missiles.

In the 1990s &quot;Alabama&quot; conducted routine refit operations out of Bangor Washington, post-refit sea trials operations in Dabob Bay, and patrol operations in the Pacific Ocean. Ports-of-call included Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California, Long Beach, California; and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

In February 1991, &quot;Alabama&quot; was selected as the change of command platform for the Commander-in-Chief Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) in Pearl Harbor. August 1992, &quot;Alabama&quot; embarked Commander-in-Chief, United States Strategic Command (CINCSTRATCOM) and his entourage of senior U.S. Air Force and Navy Officers for an at-sea submerged orientation tour concerning SSBN strategic deterrent operations. In January 1996, the boat was awarded the Battle Efficiency E and the Strategic Operations S by the Commander of Submarine Squadron 17. In March she was awarded the U.S. Strategic Command&#x27;s Omaha Trophy for ballistic missile unit excellence. In March 1999, &quot;Alabama&quot; conducted exercises with the battle group and . In September she conducted underway operations for the Defense Advisory Counsel on Women in the Services.

After completing 47 strategic deterrent patrols, &quot;Alabama&quot; underwent a refit in 1999 and returned to service with numerous tactical and survivability upgrades. In spring 2000, &quot;Alabama&quot; completed her 50th strategic deterrent patrol and celebrated her 15th birthday. During February 2000 she conducted exercises with the battle group. In April she conducted a VIP cruise in Dabob Bay, Washington to host the Chief of Defense of Japan and members of his staff. In August she again conducted exercises with the USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; battle group.

&quot;Alabama&quot; entered the Bremerton Annex of Naval Base Kitsap in 2005 to undergo a nuclear reactor refueling overhaul and conversion of her ballistic missile systems to support the Trident II D5 ballistic missiles, which replaced her Trident I C4 ballistic missiles and launchers; &quot;Alabama&quot; was the last Trident C4-equipped submarine to be refitted with the Trident D5 missile system. The refueling overhaul and Trident D5 conversion was completed in February 2009.

As of January 2025, &quot;Alabama&quot; is part of Submarine Squadron 17 and her home port is at Naval Base Kitsap, Washington

Alabama is the recipient of the 2016 and 2017 Battle &quot;E&quot;, her second and third time receiving this award.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Alabama&quot; is the setting for the 1995 film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The boat itself is seen in the movie during the diving scene as it leaves port.
* &quot;Alabama&quot; is featured in the films &quot;Time Under Fire&quot;, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, and &quot;Danger Beneath the Sea&quot;, which reused footage from &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;.

* &quot;Alabama&quot; is featured in 11th episode of the 2010 anime &quot;Highschool of the Dead&quot;. The ship itself is seen under the water launching nukes at opposing countries.

<text>The Ruskin – Library, Museum and Research Centre is an archive, museum, and research centre at Lancaster University, in the north of England. The Director of The Ruskin is Professor Sandra Kemp. Prior to 2019, The Ruskin – Library, Museum and Research Centre was known as the Ruskin Library.

The Ruskin is home to The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection, the world&#x27;s largest assemblage of works by artist, writer, environmentalist and social thinker John Ruskin (1819–1900), and his circle. The collection is on display in The Ruskin building at Lancaster University, designed for the collection by Sir Richard MacCormac, and Brantwood, Ruskin&#x27;s house, garden and estate on Coniston Water. The Collection was purchased by University of Lancaster in 2019, with support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Ruskin launched on 26 September 2019 with the exhibition, ‘Ruskin: Museum of the Near Future’, to mark the bicentenary of Ruskin&#x27;s birth in 1819.

In 2021, Lancaster University announced that The Ruskin would close until 2024 to enable planned capital works to take place. During the temporary closure, The Ruskin&#x27;s programmes of exhibitions, events, research and learning are taking place digitally and off-site.

== The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection ==
The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection was formed by the educationalist and Liberal MP, John Howard Whitehouse (1873–1955). It is the most extensive collection of Ruskin&#x27;s works in the world, and the most widely consulted because of its depth and range.

The collection contains thousands of paintings, drawings and diagrams, letters and manuscripts, photographs and daguerreotypes, a library – including Ruskin&#x27;s own collection – and a complete repository of critical writing on Ruskin. Every aspect of Ruskin&#x27;s polymathic interests are represented, from architecture and the arts, to political economy and the natural sciences.

===2019 purchase===
In 2019, the purchase of The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection at Lancaster University was funded by the Education Trust Limited and the Whitehouse Trust and with the support of the National Heritage Memorial Fund; Art Fund; Garfield Weston Foundation; Bowland Trust; Friends of the National Libraries; John R Murray Charitable Trust; Guild of St George; Aldama Foundation; Pilgrim Trust; and the Cohen Foundation.

== The building ==
Designed by Sir Richard MacCormac of MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, it was opened in 1998 by Princess Alexandra, The Hon Lady Ogilvy. It subsequently won the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; Building of the Year Award 1996, the Royal Fine Art Commission/BSkyB Building of the Year University Winner 1998, and Millennium Products status awarded by the Design Council in 1999.

==Activities==

The Collection is loaned to institutions internationally, across Europe, America and East Asia.

The Ruskin offers a programme of temporary exhibitions, talks, lectures and performances, and creative workshops for all ages. Since 2020, these have taken place digitally.

The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection is used in learning programmes taking place at Lancaster University, local schools and colleges, and continuing education, led by museum staff.

The Ruskin Research Centre is integrated with The Ruskin&#x27;s public-facing programme, producing ‘live’ research in partnership with its communities, and through its established seminar series and journal.

<text>The Talented Mr. Ripley is a 1999 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Anthony Minghella, based on Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s 1955 novel. Set in the 1950s, it stars Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, a con artist who is sent from New York City to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf, a rich and spoiled playboy, to return home – however, after failing, Ripley takes extreme measures. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also appear in supporting roles. This film was released forty years after the adaptation that had been made in 1960, &quot;Purple Noon&quot; by René Clément with Alain Delon, Maurice Ronet and Marie Laforêt.

The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $128.8 million worldwide. It received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Law.

== Plot ==
In 1958 New York City, Tom Ripley is approached by shipbuilding magnate Herbert Greenleaf, who believes that Ripley attended Princeton with his son Dickie. Greenleaf pays Ripley $1,000 to travel to Italy, where Dickie has settled, and persuade him to return to the United States. Taking an ocean liner first-class, Ripley pretends to be Dickie and befriends American socialite Meredith Logue.

In the seaside village of Mongibello, Ripley befriends Dickie and his American girlfriend Marge Sherwood by claiming to be a former Princeton classmate. He enjoys Dickie&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle and becomes obsessed with Dickie himself, but Dickie&#x27;s wealthy friend Freddie Miles mistrusts Ripley and treats him with contempt. When he returns from Rome, Dickie is disturbed to find Ripley dressed in his clothes and dancing in front of a mirror. Dickie impregnates a local woman called Silvana and then spurns her, causing her to drown herself. Ripley promises a guilt-ridden Dickie to keep the death a secret. After Herbert cuts off Ripley&#x27;s travel funds, Dickie cancels a trip to Venice and tells Ripley that they should part ways. However, Ripley convinces Dickie to take a final trip with him to San Remo.

Aboard a small boat, Dickie says that he has grown tired of Ripley and is going to marry Marge, while Ripley tells Dickie he is selfish and hurting everyone. Their argument becomes physical, and Ripley kills Dickie with an oar. Ripley takes Dickie&#x27;s belongings and scuttles the boat. Realizing that locals frequently mistake him for Dickie, Ripley assumes his identity. He forges a letter to Marge, convincing her that Dickie has left her and moved to Rome. Ripley creates the illusion that Dickie is still alive by checking into one hotel as Dickie and another as himself, then fabricating an exchange of communications between the two. Through forgery, he is able to draw on Dickie&#x27;s allowance on which he can live lavishly.

In Rome, Ripley runs into Meredith, who still knows him as Dickie, and accepts an invitation to attend an opera with her family. His ruse is threatened at the opera when he unexpectedly runs into Marge and her friend, Peter Smith-Kingsley. Ripley rushes Meredith out of the opera house and rejects her advances. Later, Freddie shows up at Ripley&#x27;s apartment looking for Dickie. When the landlady addresses Ripley as Dickie, Freddie realizes the fraud, so Ripley bludgeons him to death with a bust and disposes of his body. When the body is found, police visit the apartment to question &quot;Dickie.&quot; Ripley forges a suicide note for Dickie that claims responsibility for Freddie&#x27;s death. Under his real name, Ripley travels to Venice, where he again encounters Peter.

Herbert arrives in Italy, accompanied by private detective Alvin MacCarron. Ripley almost kills Marge after she discovers he has Dickie&#x27;s rings, but they are interrupted by Peter. Herbert dismisses Marge&#x27;s suspicions and MacCarron tells Ripley that the police are convinced that Dickie, who had a history of violence, murdered Freddie before killing himself. MacCarron also tells Ripley that Herbert intends to bequeath a large portion of Dickie&#x27;s trust fund to him, to reward his loyalty to Dickie and ensure his silence.

Free and clear of his crimes, and with the income to finally live Dickie&#x27;s lifestyle as himself, Ripley boards a liner to Greece with Peter, who is implied to be Ripley&#x27;s lover. On board, Ripley is surprised to encounter Meredith. Ripley kisses her and promises to talk later. In his cabin, Peter tells Ripley that he saw him kiss Meredith and demands answers. After apologizing for lying to him, a sobbing Ripley strangles Peter to death and returns to his cabin, alone.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
=== Casting ===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Leonardo DiCaprio declined the role that went to Matt Damon. Anthony Minghella cast Damon, after seeing his performance in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, because he felt the actor had the right mix of &quot;credibility, warmth, and generosity&quot; to engage the audience and help them understand how Ripley &quot;thinks and operates&quot;. The character of Meredith Logue, not present in the novel, was added by Minghella, with Cate Blanchett in mind. He was &quot;entranced&quot; with Blanchett, after meeting with her and surprised that she was actually interested in playing the small part. Minghella went on to write more scenes for the character, to expand her role.

Minghella happened to see the dailies from a film starring Jude Law, &quot;The Wisdom of Crocodiles&quot;, that his wife, Carolyn Choa, was producing at the time. Impressed with Law&#x27;s performance, he offered him the role of Dickie. In his &quot;insane arrogance&quot;, as Law put it, he initially refused because he did not wish to play a &quot;pretty boy&quot;. After learning of the cast Minghella was assembling and coming to understand that he would be &quot;in safe hands&quot; with Minghella, Law later accepted the part.

=== Filming ===
Apart from the beginning scenes filmed in New York City, the film was shot entirely on location in Italy. The cliffside resort town of Positano and various villages on the islands of Ischia and Procida, near Naples, were used to represent the fictional town of Mongibello. Frequent and unpredictable rain hampered the production, with Minghella stating that &quot;we had to deliver this gorgeous Mediterranean world, this beautiful world of Southern Italy, and we could never get Italy to turn beautiful...We would divide the scenes up, often into words, and go out and get two or three words and then, it would start to rain, and we&#x27;d have to go back in, again.&quot; The scenes taking place in San Remo were filmed in Anzio, a resort town near Rome. Well-known locations included the Piazza Navona, the Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna in Rome, and the Caffè Florian in the Piazza San Marco in Venice.

To prepare for the role of Ripley, Damon lost 30 pounds and learned to play the piano. Law gained weight and learned to play the saxophone for his character; he also broke a rib, when he fell backward while filming the murder scene on the boat.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; holds an approval rating of 85% based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;With Matt Damon&#x27;s unsettling performance offering a darkly twisted counterpoint to Anthony Minghella&#x27;s glossy direction, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is a suspense thriller that lingers.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 76 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, calling it &quot;an intelligent thriller&quot; that is &quot;insidious in the way it leads us to identify with Tom Ripley ... He&#x27;s a monster, but we want him to get away with it&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised Law&#x27;s performance: &quot;This is a star-making role for the preternaturally talented English actor Jude Law. Beyond being devastatingly good-looking, Mr. Law gives Dickie the manic, teasing powers of manipulation that make him ardently courted by every man or woman he knows&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; rating, and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote: &quot;Damon is at once an obvious choice for the part and a hard sell to audiences soothed by his amiable boyishness ... the facade works surprisingly well when Damon holds that gleaming smile just a few seconds too long, his Eagle Scout eyes fixed just a blink more than the calm gaze of any non-murdering young man. And in that opacity we see horror&quot;.

Charlotte O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;A tense, troubling thriller, marred only by problems of pacing (the middle section drags) and some implausible characterisation (Meredith&#x27;s obsession with Ripley never convinces), it&#x27;s full of vivid, miserable life&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the ten best films of the year and called it a &quot;devious twist on the Patricia Highsmith crime novel&quot;.

James Berardinelli gave the film two and a half stars out of four, calling it &quot;a solid adaptation&quot; that &quot;will hold a viewer&#x27;s attention&quot;, but criticized &quot;Damon&#x27;s weak performance&quot; and &quot;a running time that&#x27;s about 15 minutes too long.&quot; Berardinelli compared the film unfavorably with the previous adaptation, &quot;Purple Noon&quot;, which he gave four stars. He wrote, &quot;The remake went back to the source material, Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. The result, while arguably truer to the events of Highsmith&#x27;s book, is vastly inferior. To say it suffers by comparison to &quot;Purple Noon&quot; is an understatement. Almost every aspect of René Clément&#x27;s 1960 motion picture is superior to that of Minghella&#x27;s 1999 version, from the cinematography to the acting to the screenplay. Matt Damon might make a credible Tom Ripley, but only for those who never experienced Alain Delon&#x27;s portrayal.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;On balance, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is worth seeing more for its undeniably delightful journey than its final destination. Perhaps wall-to-wall amorality and triumphant evil leave too sour an aftertaste even for the most sophisticated anti-Hollywood palate&quot;.

In his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw wrote, &quot;&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; begins as an ingenious exposition of the great truth about charming people having something to hide: namely, their utter reliance on others. It ends up as a dismayingly un-thrilling thriller and bafflingly unconvincing character study&quot;.

In her review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Amy Taubin criticized Minghella as a &quot;would-be art film director who never takes his eye off the box office, doesn&#x27;t allow himself to become embroiled in such complexity. He turns &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; into a splashy tourist trap of a movie. The effect is rather like reading the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; in a café overlooking the Adriatic&quot;.

Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has cited &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; as one of his favorite films of all time.

===Accolades===

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; is the third big-screen Ripley adaptation, following &quot;Purple Noon&quot; (1960) and &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977). It was followed by &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; (2002) and &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; (2005), but none of the films form an official series. In April 2024, the television series &quot;Ripley&quot;, also an adaptation of Highsmith&#x27;s 1955 novel, was released.

==In other media==
A disguised Damon was credited under the &quot;Dickie Greenleaf&quot; name for his cameo in the film &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018).

<doc id="536013" wikidata="Q109297294" url="?curid=536013" title="Tolkien's round world dilemma">
<text>J. R. R. Tolkien came to feel that the flat earth cosmology he embodied in his legendarium would be unacceptable to a modern readership. In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Earth was created flat and was changed to round as a cataclysmic event during the Second Age in order to prevent direct access by Men to Valinor, home of the immortals. In the Round World Version, Earth is spherical from the beginning.

Tolkien abandoned the Round World Version before completing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but later regretted this decision. He created a Round World Version, &quot;The Drowning of Anadûnê&quot;, of the Akallabêth, the central story of the submerging of Númenor. He felt unable to proceed with it because the Flat World version was so deeply embedded in his mythology, with vitally important symbols like the Two Trees of Valinor which were difficult to fit in a Round World Version. He never resolved the dilemma, continuing to redraft his published works to make them compatible with a round world version for most of the rest of his life. 

His son Christopher, editing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; which he published after Tolkien&#x27;s death, considered adjusting the text to comply with Tolkien&#x27;s wish to return to the Round World Version. He decided against doing that, not least because the &quot;Akallabêth&quot; relies intrinsically on the Flat World cosmology.

Scholars have given at least three possible reasons why Tolkien should have felt the need for the drastic change to his mythology. Firstly, Tolkien believed that the Númenóreans would understand that a flat Earth was impossible, and so would not have passed on a story about it. Secondly, he felt that ordinary readers would find it impossible to suspend their disbelief in a flat earth with magical trees. Thirdly, his attitude seems to have shifted from feeling comfortable with mythology to wanting Middle-earth to be realistically historical.

== History ==

Tolkien gives the fullest account of the creation myth in the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot; (&quot;Music of the Ainur&quot;). He wrote the original version in the 1930s, calling it the &quot;Flat World Version&quot;, or later the &quot;Old Flat World Version&quot; after he had created a new flat world version. In 1946 he wrote the &quot;Round World Version&quot;, intending this to be the published version. Tolkien sent both the &quot;Old Flat World Version&quot; and the &quot;Round World Version&quot; to Katharine Farrer (mystery novelist and wife of the theologian Austin Farrer) for review in 1948. Farrer replied to him in October, strongly supporting the Flat World Version – &quot;The hope of Heaven is the only thing which makes modern astronomy tolerable&quot;. Farrer seems to have influenced Tolkien to abandon the Round World Version, which he did before completing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, or even starting its last volume, &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Tolkien created a new manuscript from a heavily edited Old Flat World Version. He then produced a final polished Round World manuscript with illuminated capitals. 

No version of the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot; was published during Tolkien&#x27;s lifetime, but a heavily edited version later formed the first chapter of the 1977 &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; edited by Tolkien&#x27;s son Christopher. The earliest version (named &quot;The Music of the Ainur&quot;, not &quot;Ainulindalë&quot;) was published in 1984 in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; volume 1. The Old Flat World Version was included in the 1987 &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;. Both the Round World Version and the New Flat World Version were included in the 1993 &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot;. The latter is a more faithful reproduction of Tolkien&#x27;s manuscript than the edited version in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

Tolkien wrote a Round World Version of the &quot;Akallabêth&quot;, possibly in 1948 to match the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot; Round World Version. The &quot;Akallabêth&quot; is an Atlantis-like story of the destruction of the island of Númenor, brought about by Sauron&#x27;s deception of its people. In the Flat World &quot;Akallabêth&quot;, this geographic change is part of the transition from flat to round world, effectively explaining how the world was flat in the First Age, but is round now. Like the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot;, the &quot;Akallabêth&quot; was not published during Tolkien&#x27;s lifetime, but it was included in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

Tolkien continued incorporating the Round World Versions into his later Middle-earth writings. In 1960–61, Tolkien invented heraldic devices for his characters, including a &quot;Winged Sun&quot; for Finwë. This presupposes the Round World version, as in the Flat World version the Sun does not exist until after Finwë&#x27;s death. He mentioned a Round World cosmology in a BBC interview in 1964, during which he briefly discussed the drowning of Númenor. In the third edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (published in 1966), he altered the text to have the Wood-elves lingering in the twilight of the Sun, implying a Round World, instead of lingering in the twilight before the raising of the Sun, as would be the case in a Flat World.

== In-universe description ==

Christopher Tolkien described the Round World Version as &quot;de-mythologised&quot;, as it abolishes many elements of Tolkien&#x27;s mythology. As well as removing the flat Earth, it abolishes the need for the Sun and Moon to be transported by mythical beings. Also gone are the two enormous lamps that light the Earth before the creation of the Sun: the Sun shines from the beginning. In the Round World Version, the Earth has always been round, and Arda is the name for the whole solar system, not just the Earth. The Sun and the Moon are not the fruit of the Two Trees, but preceded the creation of the Trees. Instead, the Trees preserved the light of the Sun before it was tainted by Melkor. The Moon is not created by Eru, the supreme being, as in the Flat World Version, but by Melkor, his chief antagonist, who tears it from the Earth. The Moon becomes Melkor&#x27;s stronghold, and because of this, it is moved further away from the Earth by the Valar to diminish Melkor&#x27;s influence. Christopher Tolkien considers this a further piece of de-mythologising: the Moon is created after the Earth and from a part of it, in accordance with the scientific paradigm.

In the Round World &quot;Akallabêth&quot;, the Earth is in fact round from the beginning, and the Elves teach the Númenóreans that it is so; but one of Sauron&#x27;s deceptions is to tell the Númenóreans that it is flat. As a result, when the survivors of the Downfall explore the Earth in search of their lost home, thus finding proof that the world is round, they then believe that it had been made so only &quot;after&quot; Númenor was drowned. During the Downfall, Valinor is not removed from the physical world (as in the Flat World version); instead, its landmass simply becomes America. It is instead those who dwell there, the Valar and the Elves, who since the Downfall live only in memory: thus the End of Arda is moved ahead by Eru, as far as the Elves are concerned.

According to the in-universe transmission, the legends of the Silmarillion would be passed down through Númenor. Thus, the actual stories as transmitted are &quot;blended and confused&quot;; they arise from Mannish mythology and cosmology The Elves, on the other hand, already had a picture of the world at Cuiviénen, according to which not only the Sun and Moon, but even Venus (later mythologically called Eärendil), existed already at that time.

== Tolkien&#x27;s dilemma ==

=== An internal problem: impossible to the Númenóreans ===

According to the lawyer and author on Tolkien Douglas Kane, the fundamental problem Tolkien had with the Flat World Version was that the Númenóreans, the ancestors of Men, were the means by which the legends of the earliest days were transmitted to later generations. Tolkien believed that the Númenóreans would understand that a flat Earth was impossible.

=== An external problem: incredible to the ordinary reader ===

The Tolkien scholar John D. Rateliff takes a different view of the problem, writing that Tolkien had changed his mind about what an ordinary reader would be able to believe, or the extent to which that reader might be able to suspend their disbelief, in the face of a medieval cosmology. Rateliff wrote that

Christopher Tolkien wrote in &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot; that his father had decided to reconstruct his mythology to a Round World model because he had

=== A change in attitude ===

The Inklings scholar David Bratman identifies a third possible reason for moving to a Round World model: that &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s attitude to his creation&quot; had shifted. He suggests that Tolkien had grown &quot;more analytical with details in general&quot;, giving as example the work he did late in his life, documented in &quot;The Nature of Middle-earth&quot;, in which he laboriously compares the Elvish and human life cycles. Bratman describes as an &quot;absolutely crushing moment&quot; the time when Tolkien made up his mind that 

In Bratman&#x27;s view, the cause of this change was that he had gradually and perhaps unwittingly turned the mythological legendarium into an annalistic history &quot;modeled on the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot;. The further back the exact historical dates went, the more acute the crisis became; and the dates could go very far back into what had been vague mythological time, because Elves like Elrond could remember events thousands of years before the events of the War of the Ring. And Tolkien had written &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in a far more modern style than the Silmarillion, supported by extensive &quot;historical&quot; Appendices including exact chronologies.

=== The horns of the dilemma ===

The Flat World Version, Tolkien had come to feel, was thus essentially unacceptable, whether internally or externally, requiring replacement. But the story of the submerging of Númenor relies intrinsically on this cosmology. Many other dramatic moments would be lost or need serious revision to make a Round World Version consistent across all of the works in the Middle-earth legendarium. Among the tales that would need revising is the story of the Two Trees. Matthew Dickerson calls these &quot;the most important mythic symbols in all of the legendarium&quot;.

The Round World Version thus represents a major, concrete part of Tolkien&#x27;s attempt to entirely rewrite the mythology of Middle-earth. Rateliff comments that Tolkien had an &quot;extremely good&quot; grasp of the &quot;cascading effects&quot; of making such a change in his legendarium; and that this change was uniquely awkward, as it stood at the junction of the myths from Valinor and the legends of Beleriand. Tolkien saw that he would have to rewrite the early tales that set out his cosmology, and stop work on the legends until the cosmology had been made fully consistent. In Rateliff&#x27;s view, Tolkien &quot;became convinced that he had to make changes he simply couldn&#x27;t bring himself to make&quot; and became stuck; this problem was compounded by his publisher&#x27;s rejection of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in 1951. Even if Tolkien could have resolved one of these issues, Rateliff writes, the two together &quot;probably&quot; ensured that no version of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; would be published in his lifetime.

Tolkien gave the Round World Version of the &quot;Akallabêth&quot; the name &quot;The Drowning of Anadûnê&quot;; this was eventually published in &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot; in 1992. He described this as the &quot;Man&#x27;s version&quot;, possibly to distinguish it from the Elvish version in the &quot;Akallabêth&quot;, and to reconcile why there are two versions in the legendarium. Despite his desire to abandon or heavily revise the Flat World Version, he found himself unable to do so, as it was already too deeply embedded in the universe he had created. Tolkien was attempting, but failing, to reinforce the sense of believability in his mythology by bringing it more into line with scientific knowledge of the history of the Earth. 

Patrick Curry argued in 2013 that the Round World Version generated as many problems as it solved, such as where the earthly paradise of Valinor might now be placed – though Tolkien&#x27;s own solution to this problem was only published in 2014. Carl Hostetter added that Tolkien&#x27;s solution appears to contradict &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in which Frodo journeys to what appears to be a &quot;very physical&quot; Tol Eressëa. The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger described the attempt as &quot;a 180% turn&quot;, citing Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s description of it, &quot;&#x27;a fearful weapon&#x27; against his own creation&quot;.

In Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s view, his father&#x27;s manuscripts reveal a tension or &quot;stress&quot; between the need for the new model, and the difficulty of such a fundamental reconstruction of the mythology:

Kristine Larsen likens Tolkien&#x27;s struggles to reconcile cosmology with his mythology to the Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe&#x27;s attempts to reconcile his observations with his model of the solar system. She quotes Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s description of his father&#x27;s struggles as &quot;a prolonged interior debate&quot;, and his judgement that:

In Larsen&#x27;s view, Tolkien was neither able to &quot;ignore the simple logic of a heliocentric cosmology&quot;, nor to switch over to it &quot;as it would break much of what was so poetic in his fictional cosmology.&quot;

However, Christopher Tolkien also pointed out in &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot; that the Round World version was referred to in his father&#x27;s commentary to the &quot;Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth&quot;, as well as incorporated into his last work on Chapter 6 of the &quot;Silmarillion&quot;. In the two further volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; that he released, he pointed out further references to the Round World and its associated transmission framework in several late texts: the (at least 1958–59) text &quot;Of the Ents and the Eagles&quot;, the 1959–60 text &quot;Quendi and Eldar&quot;, the c. 1968 &quot;The Shibboleth of Fëanor&quot; and &quot;The Problem of Ros&quot;, and the c. 1972–73 &quot;Glorfindel II&quot;. Carl Hostetter, in his editorial comments to the late 1960s text &quot;Dark and Light&quot; presented in &quot;The Nature of Middle-earth&quot; (discussing Elvish conceptions of astronomy before they met the Valar), also noted that the Round World changes were &quot;obviously long-lived&quot;. Douglas Kane also considered the &quot;Of the Ents and the Eagles&quot; reference as being &quot;of particular interest&quot;, even though he agreed with Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s decision to use a Flat World for the published Silmarillion.

In 2024 Vyacheslav Stepanov, writing in &quot;Palantir&quot;, the journal of the St. Petersburg Tolkien Society, pointed to such examples and added that the Round World was incorporated into the narratives as late as the c. 1972–73 text &quot;Círdan&quot;. Considering the extended period over which these revisions were done, right up to the year of Tolkien&#x27;s death, Stepanov argued that Tolkien had in fact solved the problem to his satisfaction and decided in favour of the Round World.

== Choice for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; ==

While preparing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; for its 1977 publication, Christopher Tolkien was aware that his father had intended to update it to a new Round World Version. He considered editing the manuscripts to comply with this wish. In other respects, he had edited the stories to make them internally self-consistent, and consistent with the already published canon. He later published several edited versions of his father&#x27;s Silmarillion stories in the 12-volume &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;.

Christopher decided against such a cosmological update for several reasons. What his father had left of the Round World Silmarillion was no more than an outline of his intentions. The earlier Round World Version was no longer viable, because by this stage it differed too greatly from already published works. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; would either need major rework, or the change would have to be allowed to introduce new inconsistencies.

Kristine Larsen argues that Christopher&#x27;s &quot;uncharacteristically scant&quot; commentary on the Round World revisions in &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot; is related to his own rejection of that cosmology. While she agrees with Christopher that the Flat World cosmology is &quot;beautiful&quot;, she nonetheless finds it &quot;unfortunate&quot; that these cosmological reworkings did not receive a full analysis. She points to various astronomical implications of the Round World texts (including the possible existence of extraterrestrial life in the legendarium) that Christopher did not comment on.

<doc id="536018" wikidata="Q2948738" url="?curid=536018" title="NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament">
<text>The NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament, sometimes referred to as Women&#x27;s March Madness, is a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 women&#x27;s college basketball teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to determine the national championship.

The tournament was preceded by the AIAW women&#x27;s basketball tournament, which was organized by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) from 1972 to 1982. Basketball was one of 12 women&#x27;s sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women&#x27;s collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same 12 (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women&#x27;s championships, the NCAA prevailed, while the AIAW disbanded.

As of 2022, the tournament follows the same format and selection process as its men&#x27;s counterpart, with 32 automatic bids awarded to the champions of the Division I conferences, and 36 &quot;at-large bids&quot; extended by the NCAA Selection Committee, which are placed into four regional divisions and seeded from 1 to 16. The four lowest-seeded automatic bids, and the four lowest-seeded at-large bids, compete in the First Four games to advance to the 64-team bracket in the first round. The national semi-finals, branded as the Women&#x27;s Final Four, are traditionally scheduled on the same weekend as the men&#x27;s Final Four, but in a different host city. Presently, the Women&#x27;s Final Four uses a Friday/Sunday scheduling, with its games occurring one day prior to the men&#x27;s Final Four and championship, respectively.

Attendance and interest in the women&#x27;s championship have grown over the years, especially from 2003 to 2016, when the final championship game was moved to the Tuesday following the Monday men&#x27;s championship game. The tournament is often overshadowed by the more-prominent men&#x27;s tournament; after a gender equality review following the 2021 tournament, the NCAA expanded it to the current 68-team format of the men&#x27;s tournament and extended the &quot;March Madness&quot; branding to the tournament as well. The 2024 women&#x27;s championship was the first to receive higher viewership than the men&#x27;s championship the same year. Still, the tournament receives a smaller amount of funding from broadcast rights (which are held by ESPN, and are pooled with those of other NCAA Division I championships besides golf and men&#x27;s basketball) and sponsorship (which are sold by CBS and Turner Sports) than the men&#x27;s tournament.

With 11 national titles, the UConn Huskies hold the record for the most NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championships, which included four straight championships from 2013 through 2016. The team had also made the semi-finals for 14 consecutive tournaments.

== Tournament format ==
From 1982 to 1990, 1996 to 2002, 2017 to 2019 and since 2021, the Women&#x27;s Final Four is usually played on the Friday before the Men&#x27;s Final Four or the hours before the men played on the final Saturday of the tournament. The final, since 2023, is played the Sunday afternoon following the Men&#x27;s Final Four; from 2017 to 2019, 2021 and 2022, Sunday evening.

The tournament bracket is made up of champions from each Division I conference, which are automatic bids. The remaining slots are at-large bids, with teams chosen by an NCAA selection committee. The selection process and tournament seedings are based on several factors, including team rankings, win–loss records, and NET data.
Since 2022, 68 teams qualify for the tournament played in March and April. Of these teams, 32 earn automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. Since 2017 the Ivy League conducts its own post-season tournament. The remaining teams are granted &quot;at-large&quot; bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Dr. Marilyn McNeil, vice president/director of athletics at Monmouth University is the current chairwoman. On March 1, 2011, Bowling Green State University&#x27;s director of intercollegiate athletics, Greg Christopher, was appointed chair of the NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Basketball Committee during the 2011–12 academic year.

The tournament begins with four opening-round games known as the First Four. Like the men&#x27;s version, the women&#x27;s First Four involves the four lowest-ranked conference champions playing for 16 seeds in the round of 64, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams playing for their own spots in the round of 64.

The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning that all first-round games involve teams whose seeds add up to 17).

== Number of teams, and seeding ==
The first NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament was held in 1982. The AIAW also held a basketball tournament in 1982, but most of the top teams, including defending AIAW champion Louisiana Tech, decided to participate in the NCAA tournament.

The championship consisted of 32 teams from 1982 to 1985 (in 1983, 36), 40 teams from 1986 to 1988, and 48 teams from 1989 to 1993. From 1994 to 2021, 64 teams competed in each tournament. From 2022, the tournament will involve 68 teams, matching the size of the D-I men&#x27;s tournament.

Prior to 1996, seeding was conducted on a regional basis. The top teams (eight in the 32-, 40-, and 48-team formats, and 16 in the 64-team format) were ranked and seeded on a national basis. The remaining teams were then seeded based on their geographic region. Teams were moved outside of its geographic region only if it was necessary to balance the bracket, or if the proximity of an opponent outside of its region would be comparable and a more competitive game would result. In 1993, all teams except for the top four were explicitly unseeded. The regional seeding resumed in 1994. In 1996, seeds were assigned on a national basis using an &quot;S-Curve&quot; format similar to the process used in selecting the field for the men&#x27;s tournament.

The following table summarizes some of the key attributes of the seeding process:

==Selection process==

A special selection committee appointed by the NCAA determines which 68 teams will enter the tournament, and where they will be seeded and placed in the bracket. Because of the automatic bids, only 36 teams (the at-large bids) rely on the selection committee to secure them a spot in the tournament.

;Notes
==Tournament trends==

===Top-ranked teams===
Since the women&#x27;s tournament began in 1982, 20 teams have entered the tournament ranked #1 in at least 1 poll and gone on to win the tournament:
* 1982: Louisiana Tech
* 1983: USC
* 1986: Texas
* 1989: Tennessee
* 1995: UConn
* 1998: Tennessee
* 1999: Purdue
* 2000: UConn
* 2002: UConn
* 2003: UConn
* 2009: UConn
* 2010: UConn
* 2012: Baylor
* 2014: UConn
* 2015: UConn
* 2016: UConn
* 2019: Baylor
* 2021: Stanford
* 2022: South Carolina
* 2024: South Carolina

===Champions excluded the next year===
Only once has the reigning champion (the previous year&#x27;s winner) not made it to the tournament the next year.
* 1985 champion Old Dominion went 15–13 in 1986.

===No. 1 seeds===
Since 1982, at least one #1 seed has made the Final Four every year.

Under coach Geno Auriemma, Connecticut has been seeded #1 a record 22 times. Tennessee is second with 21 #1 seeds.

All four #1 seeds have made it to the Final Four 4 times (champion in bold):
* 1989 Auburn, Louisiana Tech, Maryland, Tennessee
* 2012 Baylor, UConn, Notre Dame, Stanford
* 2015 UConn, Maryland, Notre Dame, South Carolina
* 2018 UConn, Mississippi State, Notre Dame, Louisville

The championship game has matched two #1 seeds 15 times:
* 1983 USC beat Louisiana Tech
* 1986 Texas beat USC
* 1989 Tennessee beat Auburn
* 1991 Tennessee beat Virginia
* 1995 UConn beat Tennessee
* 2000 UConn beat Tennessee
* 2002 UConn beat Oklahoma
* 2003 UConn beat Tennessee
* 2010 UConn beat Stanford
* 2012 Baylor beat Notre Dame
* 2014 UConn beat Notre Dame
* 2015 UConn beat Notre Dame
* 2018 Notre Dame beat Mississippi State
* 2019 Baylor beat Notre Dame
* 2024 South Carolina beat Iowa

Three teams have beaten three #1 seeds during the course of a tournament (the largest number of such teams that can be faced) (all three teams won the national championship as beating a 3rd #1 seed in a single tournament can only happen in the finals):
* 1987 Tennessee (beat Auburn, Long Beach State, Louisiana Tech)
* 1988 Louisiana Tech (beat Auburn, Tennessee, Texas)
* 2005 Baylor (beat LSU, Michigan State, North Carolina)

Prior to the expansion of the tournament to 64 teams, all four #1 seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen with three exceptions. Notably, the first two times this occurred were at the hands of the same school:
* 1986 East #1 seed Virginia lost to #8 seed James Madison
* 1991 East #1 seed Penn State lost to #8 seed James Madison
* 1992 Midwest #1 seed Iowa lost to #8 seed Southwest Missouri State

===High seeds===
* 1999 was the first time in tournament history (since the expansion to 64 teams) that all top seeds (1, 2, 3, and 4 seeds) made it to the Sweet Sixteen.

===Low seeds===
===Teams entering the tournament unbeaten===
Of the 20 teams who have entered the tournament unbeaten, 10 went on to win the National Championship.

The first record here refers to the record before the first game of the NCAA tournament.

====Undefeated teams not in the tournament====
The NCAA tournament has undergone dramatic expansion since its first edition in 1982, and only one unbeaten team has failed to qualify for the tournament—California Baptist in 2021, which was 24–0 after winning the Western Athletic Conference Tournament. As, by definition, a team would have to win its conference tournament, and thus secure an automatic bid to the tournament, to be undefeated in a season, the only way a team could finish undefeated and not reach the tournament is if the team is banned from postseason play. (Other possibilities are that the team is independent, or is from a conference not yet eligible for an automatic bid.) Postseason bans can come about for one of two reasons:
* The team is serving a postseason ban due to NCAA sanctions.
* The team is transitioning from a lower NCAA division, during which time it is barred by NCAA rule from participation in NCAA-sponsored postseason play. This is the case for California Baptist, which began a transition from Division II in 2018 and thus could not play in the NCAA tournament until 2023. California Baptist was eligible for the WNIT because that tournament is not operated by the NCAA, unlike the men&#x27;s version (or the Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitation Tournament introduced in 2024); the Lancers lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Rice.

===Home state===
Only one team has ever played the Final Four on its home court. Two other teams have played the Final Four in their home cities, and seven others have played the Final Four in their home states.

The only team to play on its home court was Texas in 1987, which lost its semifinal game at the now-defunct Frank Erwin Special Events Center.

Old Dominion enjoyed nearly as large an advantage in 1983 when the Final Four was played at the Norfolk Scope in its home city of Norfolk, Virginia, but also lost its semifinal. The Scope has never been the Monarchs&#x27; regular home court. ODU has always used on-campus arenas, first the ODU Fieldhouse and since 2002 Chartway Arena. The following year, USC won the national title at Pauley Pavilion, the home court of its Los Angeles archrival UCLA.

Of the other teams to play in their home states, Stanford (1992) won the national title; Notre Dame (2011) lost in the championship game; and Western Kentucky (1986), Penn State (2000), Missouri State (2001), LSU (2004), and Baylor (2010) lost in the semifinals.

===Championship margins===
* Overtime games in a championship game:
** Tennessee 70, Virginia 67/OT (1991)
** Maryland 78, Duke 75/OT (2006)
* Smallest margin of victory in a championship game: 1 point
** North Carolina 60, Louisiana Tech 59 (1994)
** Baylor 82, Notre Dame 81 (2019)
** Stanford 54, Arizona 53 (2021)
* Biggest margin of victory in a championship game: 33 points
** UConn 93, Louisville 60 (2013)
* Margin of 10 points: Louisiana Tech (1982), Tennessee (1987 &amp; 1989), Purdue (1999), UConn (2000, 2002, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016), and Baylor (2012) are teams to win every game in the tournament by 10 points or more on their way to a championship. The 2016 UConn team won every game by more than 20 points.
* Top 9 largest point differentials accumulated over the entire tournament by tournament champion. Notably, Louisiana Tech&#x27;s differential is prior to the expansion of 64 teams and the addition of one more round of play.
** 2016 UConn (+239)
** 2010 UConn (+214)
** 2013 UConn (+208)
** 2015 UConn (+197)
** 2000 UConn (+187)
** 2002 UConn (+161)
** 2019 Baylor (+159)
** 1982 Louisiana Tech (+158)
** 2014 UConn (+156)

==Television coverage and revenues==

Broadcast rights to the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament are included in a larger package covering most NCAA Division I championships, outside of men&#x27;s basketball (which is held by CBS and TNT Sports), and golf (which is held by Golf Channel). ESPN has held exclusive rights to the tournament since 1996; beginning with an 11-year, $200 million contract renewal in 2003, ESPN would televise all 63 games in the tournament on television (increasing from 23), with games in the first and second rounds airing regionally on ESPN and ESPN2. Out-of-market games were carried via pay-per-view. Coverage later expanded to include ESPN&#x27;s college sports-oriented network ESPNU, and ESPN360 for streaming. In 2011, ESPN renewed this agreement through the 2023–24 season, in a deal reported to be worth $500 million in total. The deal also included rights to the men&#x27;s tournament outside of the United States for ESPN International. In 2024, ESPN renewed the contract again through 2032 (aligned with the end of the media rights for the men&#x27;s tournament), in an agreement valued at $920 million over eight years.

In the first two rounds, one channel (typically ESPN or ESPN2&#x27;s high-definition feed) typically aired &quot;whiparound&quot; coverage during each window, carrying rolling coverage of all games in progress. ESPN&#x27;s standard definition channels were used to broadcast games on a regional basis, while games could also be viewed in their entirety on ESPN3 or alternate channels. In 2021, ESPN adopted a broadcast arrangement similar to the men&#x27;s tournament, with all games airing nationally in their entirety on either an ESPN linear channel or, for the first time, ABC. The Women&#x27;s Final Four and championship remained exclusive to ESPN. Beginning in 2023, the national championship game has aired on ABC.

In data issued by the NCAA in 2021, it was stated that 15.9% of the value of the contract was allocated to the women&#x27;s tournament, or approximately $6.1 million annually. In comparison, the contract for the men&#x27;s tournament is valued at over $700 million annually. Amid scrutiny of inequality between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments that year, it has been suggested by critics that the structure of the NCAA&#x27;s contract undervalues the media rights to the women&#x27;s tournament. Based on average viewership, Emily Caron and Eben Novy-Williams of &quot;Sportico&quot; estimated that the women&#x27;s tournament could fetch at least $20 million per year if its media rights were sold separately. America East Conference commissioner Amy Huchthausen argued that the ESPN contract &quot;provides a measure of financial certainty, but it does not provide women&#x27;s basketball (or any of the other sports, for that matter) an incentive to grow&quot;. 

Following major media criticism of inequities between the 2021 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments, the NCAA commissioned a comprehensive gender equity review of its championships by the law firm Kaplan Hecker &amp; Fink. Among the report&#x27;s findings was that U.S. television rights for the women&#x27;s tournament would be worth at least $81 million annually by the time the current broadcast contract with ESPN expires in 2024 (in comparison to the $34 million value of the NCAA package as a whole).

In an interview on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on the day of the 2023 national championship, new NCAA president Charlie Baker implicated that the media rights to the women&#x27;s basketball tournament may be sold separately in the next rights cycle, stating that &quot;we do have an opportunity to put it out separately, and we&#x27;re going to work really hard to make sure that those student-athletes, those schools, those programs get what I describe as what they should get.&quot; Interest in Caitlin Clark&#x27;s tournament run had led to record viewership of Iowa&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Final Four and championship games on ESPN and ABC, respectively. 

Nevertheless, the NCAA renewed its existing agreements with ESPN in January 2024 under an eight-year agreement, with ESPN paying approximately $115 million per season, and the NCAA having valued the media rights to the Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament at $65 million. The agreement also includes expanded rights for ESPN to sell sponsorships (although CBS/WBD will still administer the NCAA Corporate Champion and Partner Program sponsorships per its rights to the men&#x27;s tournament), and guarantees that the national championship will air on ABC annually.

<text>The black tetra (Gymnocorymbus ternetzi), also known as the black skirt tetra, petticoat tetra, high-fin black skirt tetra, black widow tetra and blackamoor, is a freshwater fish of the characin family (Characidae). 

It is native to the Paraguay River basin of south-central Brazil (mainly Pantanal region), Paraguay and northeast Argentina, but there are also populations in the upper Paraná and Paraíba do Sul Rivers that likely were introduced. It was formerly reported from the Guapore River, but this population is part of &quot;G. flaviolimai&quot;, which is found throughout the Madeira River basin and was described in 2015. The black tetra is often kept in aquariums.

Growing up to in length, the black tetra has a roughly tetragonal body shape and is greyish in colour, fading from near black at the tail to light at the nose. Two prominent, black, vertical bars appear just posterior to the gills. It is easily distinguished from all of its congeners by the presence of a dense field of dark chromatophores spread homogeneously over the posterior one half of the body unlike the lack of such pigmentation in all congeners.

The black widow tetra is a shoaling fish that feeds on small crustaceans, insects, and worms.

==In the aquarium==

The black skirt tetra is a common fish that is widely available for purchase.

Hobbyists often provide live foods such as &quot;Daphnia&quot; and mosquito larvae, and frozen foods like bloodworms.
The species reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age. Like most characins, this species spawns by intermittently releasing and fertilizing eggs among plants. It frequently eats its own eggs, so keepers remove the fish after spawning.

The lifespan in captivity is 3 to 5 years.

The black tetra was also used to make genetically modified fish sold as GloFish (fluorescent colored fish), available in a wide variety of colors.

==Similar names==
The black phantom tetra (&quot;Hyphessobrycon megalopterus&quot;) is a separate species. The black neon tetra (&quot;Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi&quot;) is sometimes also called the black tetra.

<doc id="536023" wikidata="Q1317331" url="?curid=536023" title="1997 World Series">
<text>The 1997 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1997 season. The 93rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians and the National League (NL) champion Florida Marlins. The Marlins, who were underdogs, defeated the Indians, four games to three, to win their first World Series championship. Game 7 was decided in extra innings on a walk-off single hit by Édgar Rentería. The series began on October 18 and ended on October 26 (though Game 7 ended just after midnight local time October 27). Marlins pitcher Liván Hernández was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.

The Indians advanced to the World Series by defeating the New York Yankees in the AL Division Series, three games to two, and then the Baltimore Orioles in the AL Championship Series, four games to two; it was Cleveland&#x27;s second World Series appearance in three years. The Marlins advanced to the World Series by defeating the San Francisco Giants in the NL Division Series, three games to none, and then the Atlanta Braves in the NL Championship Series, four games to two; the Marlins set an MLB record by reaching a World Series in just their fifth season of existence. This was the fourth time in World Series history a Game 7 went into extra innings, and was the most recent occasion until the 2016 World Series, in which the Indians also lost in extra innings. The Marlins&#x27; championship made them the first wild card team to ever win the World Series.

This was the only World Series that Paul Beeston would preside over as CEO of MLB. The previous four World Series had been presided over jointly by the league presidents (first Dr. Bobby Brown and then Gene Budig for the AL, Leonard Coleman for the NL).

==Summary==

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The first World Series game in the state of Florida, Game 1 featured a youngster and a veteran facing each other on the mound. Fresh off his NLCS MVP performance, Liván Hernández took the mound for the Marlins and quickly gave up a run in the first thanks to a double by leadoff man Bip Roberts and an RBI single by David Justice. Indian starter Orel Hershiser got by the first two innings unscathed. However, after the Marlins tied the game in the third on Edgar Renteria&#x27;s RBI groundout with two on, they scored four runs in the fourth. Moisés Alou&#x27;s three-run home run off the left field foul pole put the Marlins up 4–1 and Charles Johnson followed with a home run to make it 5–1. After Manny Ramírez&#x27;s home run in the fifth cut the lead to 5–2, Hershiser allowed a one-out walk and single in the bottom of the inning before Jeff Conine&#x27;s RBI single made it 6–2 Marlins. Jeff Juden relieved Hershiser and after a force-out at second, threw a ball four wild pitch that let Bobby Bonilla score from third. Jim Thome&#x27;s home run cut the lead to 7–3 in the sixth, then the Indians got another run in the eighth off Jay Powell when Marquis Grissom walked with two outs and scored on Brian Giles&#x27;s double, but Florida closer Robb Nen came in the ninth and got out of a jam by striking out Sandy Alomar Jr. and Thome with two men aboard.

===Game 2===
Game 2 matched up Florida ace Kevin Brown against Chad Ogea, who had lost two games in the ALCS. Both teams scored in the first, thanks to RBI singles by David Justice for the Indians after Omar Vizquel doubled with one out and Jeff Conine for the Marlins with two on. Ogea barely escaped further damage when Moisés Alou got under a hanging curveball, but merely flied out to the warning track, missing his second three-run homer in as many nights by inches. After that, Ogea settled in and did not allow any more runs in innings. Brown pitched well until the fifth when the Indians took the lead by stringing together three singles by Matt Williams, Sandy Alomar Jr., and Marquis Grissom. Later in the inning, with runners on second and third, Bip Roberts drove in a pair of runs with a single up the middle giving the Tribe a 4–1 lead. The three-run lead ballooned to five when Alomar hit a laser into the left field stands for a two-run home run in the sixth. The Indians&#x27; 6–1 win tied the series heading to Cleveland.

===Game 3===
Game 3 was a wild affair that ended with the Marlins grabbing a 2–1 series lead. Charles Nagy of the Indians faced Al Leiter of the Marlins. Both pitchers fared poorly, with Leiter giving up seven runs (four earned) in innings and Nagy gave up five in six innings. In the top of the first, Gary Sheffield started the scoring with a home run to left. In the bottom half, the Indians retaliated with two runs thanks to two broken bat RBI singles by Matt Williams and Sandy Alomar Jr. Nagy&#x27;s bases loaded walk to Sheffield tied the game in the third, before Florida took a 3–2 lead in the fourth on Darren Daulton&#x27;s home run. However, the Indians got a gift in the bottom of the fourth, when they drew four free passes, then a throwing error by third baseman Bobby Bonilla on Manny Ramírez&#x27;s single allowed two more runs to score. The Tribe went up 7–3 on Jim Thome&#x27;s two-run home run to right in the fifth inning, which also knocked Leiter out of the game. His home run was nullified in the sixth by Jim Eisenreich&#x27;s two-run home run that cut the lead to 7–5. In the seventh, Craig Counsell hit a leadoff single off Brian Anderson and moved to second on a groundout, then Édgar Rentería&#x27;s single and Gary Sheffield&#x27;s double off Mike Jackson (who was charged with a blown save) each drove in a run, making the score 7–7. In the ninth, Bonilla drew a leadoff walk off reliever Eric Plunk and scored on Daulton&#x27;s single aided by an error that let Daulton go to third. After a strikeout to Alou (his third of the night) and intentional walk to pinch-hitter Cliff Floyd, an error by first baseman Thome on Plunk&#x27;s pickoff attempt allowed Daulton to score. After Charles Johnson singled, Alvin Morman relieved Plunk and an error by second baseman Tony Fernández on Counsell&#x27;s ground ball allowed Floyd to score. After Morman retired Devon White, a walk to Rentería loaded the bases before José Mesa relieved Morman and allowed two-run singles to Sheffield and Bonilla aided by a wild pitch that gave the Marlins at 14–7 lead. In the bottom of the inning, the Indians loaded the bases on a walk and two singles with one out off Robb Nen before Tony Fernández&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Marquis Grissom&#x27;s single scored a run each, then Bip Roberts&#x27; two-run double cut the lead to 14–11, but Omar Vizquel grounded out to end the game. Dennis Cook got the win in relief by tossing a scoreless eighth and Plunk got the loss. This was the highest scoring game for 20 years until the fifth game of the 2017 World Series between the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers; it was also the fourth time a team had scored seven runs in the ninth inning of a postseason game and the first since the 1990 ALCS. Marlins batter Gary Sheffield had five RBIs in the game to lead all batters.

===Game 4===
This back-and-forth World Series continued that way in Game 4. Both teams were greeted by snow during batting practice and freezing temperatures throughout this contest. The official gametime temperature of 35 °F (3.3 °C) remains the coldest recorded in World Series history. As the game progressed, media outlets reported wind chill readings as low as 18 °F (−7.8 °C). Two rookies opposed each other on the mound, Jaret Wright for the Indians and Tony Saunders for the Marlins. In the bottom of the first, Omar Vizquel singled with one out before Manny Ramírez&#x27;s two-run home run put the Indians up 2–0. Matt Williams then singled with two outs and scored on Sandy Alomar&#x27;s double. In the third, Ramírez drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on an error and scored on David Justice&#x27;s single. After another walk, Alomar&#x27;s single scored Justice. After a third walk loaded the bases, Antonio Alfonseca relived Saunders and allowed an RBI single to Tony Fernández. The Marlins got on the board in the fourth on Jim Eisenreich&#x27;s RBI single with two on, then Moisés Alou&#x27;s two-run home run after a walk in the sixth cut the Indians&#x27; lead to 6–3, but that was as close as the Marlins got. In the bottom of the inning, Alomar&#x27;s bases-loaded groundout off Ed Vosberg made it 7–3 Indians. Next inning, Fernández hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a ground out and scored on Brian Giles&#x27;s single. In the eighth, Williams&#x27; two-run home run after a walk capped the game&#x27;s scoring at 10–3 as the Indians tied the series at two games apiece which guaranteed a return to Florida. Wright allowed three runs in six sharp innings and Brian Anderson wrapped up Wright&#x27;s win with a three-inning save.

===Game 5===
Game 5 was a rematch of Game 1&#x27;s starting pitchers Liván Hernández and Orel Hershiser. The Marlins struck first when Darren Daulton hit a ground-rule double and scored on Charles Johnson&#x27;s single. After a walk to Craig Counsell, Devon White&#x27;s RBI double made it 2–0 Marlins. The Indians cut it to 2–1 in the bottom of the inning when Jim Thome tripled and scored on Sandy Alomar&#x27;s single. Next inning, Alomar launched a towering three-run home run after two walks to Thome and Matt Williams to put the Indians up 4–2. In the sixth, Moisés Alou hit his second three-run home run off Hershiser in as many games and his third home run of the Series to put the Marlins up 5–4. Eric Plunk then walked Craig Counsell with the bases loaded to force in Jeff Conine, with the run charged to Hershiser. The Marlins added to their lead in the seventh when Alou hit a leadoff single off Jeff Juden, stole second, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Johnson&#x27;s single. Next inning, Alou&#x27;s single scored pinch-runner Alex Arias (running for Bonilla) with two on off José Mesa extended the lead to 8–4. Livan pitched terrifically in the middle innings, not allowing any runs until the ninth. An error and single put two on with no outs for the Indians. Robb Nen in relief allowed a two-run single to David Justice (both of the runs charged to Hernández), then a two-out RBI single to Thome before Alomar flew out to right to end the game and give the Marlins a 3–2 series lead heading back to Florida.

===Game 6===
Game 6&#x27;s attendance of 67,498 was the highest single-game attendance for the World Series since Game 5 of the 1959 World Series, when 92,706 people filled the football-oriented Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Series returned to the warmer climate of Miami for Game 6. Kevin Brown opposed Chad Ogea again and again Brown inexplicably struggled while Ogea flourished. Chad himself drove in the first two runs with a bases-loaded single in the second, and Manny Ramírez hit a sacrifice fly in the third (after Omar Vizquel hit a leadoff double and stole third) and the fifth (after a leadoff double and subsequent single). Darren Daulton&#x27;s sacrifice fly with two on in the fifth that scored Moisés Alou from third gave the Marlins their only run of the game. With the Tribe leading 4–1 in the sixth, Ogea ran into serious trouble. The Marlins put runners on second and third with two out as reliever Mike Jackson replaced Ogea. Marlins catcher Charles Johnson stepped to the plate and proceeded to hit a sharp grounder that was headed for left field and looked like a base hit. Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel, who won the Gold Glove that year, dove for the ball, grabbed it, sprung to his feet, and hurled a perfect strike to first base just before Johnson arrived. The play ended the threat and broke the Marlins&#x27; spirits. In the ninth, closer José Mesa wrapped up the win despite allowing a triple to Devon White to tie the Series at 3–3. This was the last playoff game won by Cleveland when facing elimination until Game 4 of the 2024 American League Division Series.

===Game 7===
For the decisive final matchup of the World Series, the first time since 1991 that a Game 7 would be played, the Marlins sent Al Leiter to the mound to start. Leiter had been the starter for the Marlins in the high-scoring Game 3 in Cleveland, where he gave up a total of seven runs and did not make it out of the fifth inning, but was spared a potential loss when the Marlins rallied to win. The potential existed for a Game 3 rematch of Leiter and Indians ace Charles Nagy. Nagy managed to pitch six innings and gave up five runs, all earned, in his outing. Like Leiter, he was left with a no-decision after the Cleveland bullpen allowed Florida to tie the game and later win. However, Indians manager Mike Hargrove, celebrating his 48th birthday this day, chose to give the start to rookie Jaret Wright on short rest. Wright had yet to lose a decision in the postseason to this point, and had won Game 4 earlier in the series. 

The Marlins managed one hit in the 1st inning, a double off the bat of Édgar Rentería. That was the only hit Wright gave up through six innings, and the Indians staked him to a 2–0 lead in the third. With nobody out, Jim Thome walked and Marquis Grissom singled him to second. After Wright bunted the runners into scoring position, Leiter struck out Omar Vizquel for the second out. The next batter, Tony Fernández, singled to drive both runners in. 

The Indians threatened again in the fifth inning, as Vizquel singled with one out. He stole second while Fernandez batted, putting himself in scoring position. Leiter struck Fernandez out, then gave an intentional walk to Manny Ramirez to put two runners on. Vizquel then managed to steal third base, but Leiter struck out David Justice to end the inning. He would leave the game after retiring the Indians in order in the sixth.

Meanwhile, not only had Wright allowed a single hit through six innings, but he had also managed to keep the Marlins off of the bases. Entering the seventh inning, he had only allowed a total of four baserunners; in addition to the Rentería double, he had walked Gary Sheffield in the first and Leiter in the fifth, and Darren Daulton had reached on a three-base error when Ramirez misplayed a line drive. 

The Marlins finally broke through in the bottom of the seventh as Bobby Bonilla hit Wright&#x27;s first pitch over the right-center field wall for a home run to cut the lead to 2–1. After striking out Charles Johnson and walking Craig Counsell, Wright was removed from the game in favor of Paul Assenmacher who was scheduled to pitch to Cliff Floyd. Marlins manager Jim Leyland elected to send Kurt Abbott to the plate after the pitching change; Assenmacher retired him on a fly ball, then got Devon White swinging to end the inning.

In the top of the ninth inning, Cleveland again threatened. After Antonio Alfonseca walked Matt Williams to lead off the inning and Sandy Alomar Jr. reached on a fielder&#x27;s choice to take Williams off the bases, Félix Heredia gave up a single to Thome which advanced Alomar to third. He was then pulled in favor of closer Robb Nen. Nen induced a groundball from Grissom to Rentería at shortstop, who elected to throw Alomar out at home, thanks in part to a great pick and tag by Johnson. He then got Brian Giles to fly out to end the inning.

The Indians sent closer José Mesa to the mound to try to win the series in the bottom of the ninth inning. Moisés Alou led off with a single, and Bonilla struck out swinging on a 3–2 pitch. Johnson then followed with a single to advance Alou to third, bringing Counsell to the plate. On a 1-1 pitch, Counsell hit a deep fly ball to right that nearly went over the wall, which would have won the series for the Marlins. Although Ramirez was able to catch the ball on the warning track for the second out, Alou was able to score from third without a throw and the score was tied at 2. Mesa managed to get out of the inning by retiring Jim Eisenreich. 

Nen struck out the side in the top of the 10th inning. In the bottom of the frame, Mesa gave up back-to-back one-out singles, and after striking out John Cangelosi looking on a 3-2 pitch, Hargrove elected to finally use his ace starter and brought Nagy into the game to face Alou, who flied out to end the inning. After walking Williams, leading off the top of the 11th inning, Jay Powell retired Cleveland in order thanks to an alert fielder&#x27;s choice on a sacrifice bunt by Alomar, which Powell fielded and threw out the lead runner at 2nd, followed by a Jim Thome inning-ending double play.

Bonilla led off the bottom off the eleventh by singling to center. Gregg Zaun, who replaced Johnson after pinch running for him in the bottom the ninth, stepped in for his first at bat and was asked to bunt Bonilla over. Zaun popped the ball up on the bunt attempt, however, and Bonilla barely beat Nagy’s throw back to first to try to double him off. 

Counsell followed with a slow ground ball to the second base side. Bonilla stopped halfway between first and second, choosing to let the ball roll by before trying to advance; if the ball had touched him, he would have been called out for runners&#x27; interference. By doing this, he not only saved the Marlins an out, but also forced Fernandez, playing behind the second base bag, to lose sight of the ball as it rolled to him. The veteran second baseman was not able to field the grounder cleanly, and Bonilla was able to advance to third on the error with Counsell reaching first. 

Nagy walked Eisenreich, the next batter, intentionally, loading the bases for White. Instead of playing for the double play, Hargrove pulled the infield in to try to cut off the winning run, since Bonilla was a much slower baserunner than White and would be able to score if White beat out the relay throw on a double play. White grounded to second, and Fernandez immediately threw home for the force out to retire Bonilla. 

While the bases were still loaded, as White reached on the fielder’s choice, there were now two outs and Nagy faced Rentería with a chance to get out of the jam and extend the game. Rentería, behind 0-1, hit a hard line drive back up the middle. Nagy tried to field the ball, but it hit off of his glove and went into center field. Counsell scored the series winning run, then leaped into the air in celebration.

After Game 7, the trophy presentation, usually taking place in the winning team&#x27;s locker room regardless of venue, took place on the field for the first time ever before the crowd of 67,204. It was presided over by then-Chairman of the Executive Committee Bud Selig, who first did the honors in 1995 and would officially become Commissioner of Baseball in 1998. This is now a standard procedure whenever the champions are the home team of the deciding game (the only exception being 1999, when the New York Yankees chose to celebrate in their locker room, likely due to the controversy involving Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis and NBC Sports reporter Jim Gray during an interview following Game 3). However, this would not become a regular practice until 2001 as the next three World Series (1998, 1999, &amp; 2000) had the trophy presentation in the winning teams clubhouse.

It was the first time since that the two teams alternated wins throughout the World Series.

In only their fifth season of existence, the Marlins were the quickest expansion team to reach (and win) the World Series until , when the Arizona Diamondbacks did it in their fourth year. Coincidentally, both World Series ended with a game-winning RBI single with Craig Counsell being on the basepath for each.

1997 World Series (4–3): Florida Marlins (N.L.) beat Cleveland Indians (A.L.)
==Aftermath==
Liván Hernández was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1997 World Series. Chad Ogea became the first pitcher since Mickey Lolich in 1968 to have at least two hits and two RBIs in a World Series. The Marlins won despite not having Alex Fernandez, their number-two starter, who did not pitch due to a rotator cuff injury.

On October 31, 1997, most of the key contributors of the 1997 Marlins were traded, including Moisés Alou, who was sent to the Houston Astros, and Al Leiter to the New York Mets, in a fire sale so infamous that it has come to synonymize the term in the baseball world. The Marlins also lost Jeff Conine to the Kansas City Royals in free agency and Darren Daulton who retired. World Series MVP hurler Liván Hernández, however, stayed with the team for two more years. The Marlins finished 54–108 in 1998, the worst performance ever by a defending World Series champion. As a result, these Marlins are mockingly referred to as the first &quot;Rent-A-Team&quot; to win the World Series. Midway through the 1998 season, the Marlins would trade Jim Eisenreich, Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, and Charles Johnson to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Todd Zeile and Mike Piazza. Piazza would be traded shortly after to the Mets in return for prospects, one of which was Preston Wilson.

Jim Leyland, responding to reports that he would retire if the Marlins won the World Series, told NBC during the celebration, &quot;My wife doesn&#x27;t like me that much. I can&#x27;t retire.&quot; However, he resigned in the wake of their awful performance in 1998. He managed the Colorado Rockies in 1999, then scouted for several years before joining the Detroit Tigers as manager in 2006. Leyland led the Tigers to World Series appearances in 2006 and 2012. Leyland was hired as Tigers manager by Dave Dombrowski, the architect of the 1997 Marlins. Dombrowski would later build another World Series-winning team, the 2018 Boston Red Sox, and also oversaw a World Series appearance from the 2022 Philadelphia Phillies.

Marlins owner H. Wayne Huizenga, who dodged questions about selling the team during the on-field celebration, ultimately sold the team to John W. Henry after the 1998 season. Henry in turn sold it to former Montreal Expos owner Jeffrey Loria in 2001 as part of a deal to purchase the Boston Red Sox. Loria would return the team to a World Series victory in 2003. That season started with only one of the 1997 World Series players left on the roster: pitcher Rick Helling. Helling was traded mid-season to the Texas Rangers. However, the team traded with the Baltimore Orioles for Jeff Conine. Conine would be the only 1997 Marlin to participate in the 2003 World Series victory. The 1997 and 2003 seasons marked the Marlins&#x27; only trips to the postseason until 2020, when the Marlins lost the NLDS to the Atlanta Braves.

The failure of José Mesa to save Game 7 ultimately ignited a heated feud with teammate Omar Vizquel. In Vizquel&#x27;s autobiography, the veteran shortstop called Mesa a &quot;choker.&quot; The two men ended their longtime friendship. Mesa later vowed to &quot;...hit him every time&quot; he faced him, and also stated that he wanted to kill Vizquel. Though Mesa did not actually bean Vizquel every time he subsequently faced him, he did hit him with pitches at least twice.

The Indians would go on to win the AL Central three of the following four years, returning to the ALCS the following season. However, they were defeated in six games by the record-setting New York Yankees. They would not advance to another World Series until 2016, where they 
gave up a 3-1 series lead and allowed the Chicago Cubs to win their first World Series in 108 years. Coincidentally, the Indians suffered a Game 7 defeat in extra-innings, just like the 1997 team. 

The core of the 1990s Indians teams would break up in the early 2000s, most notably with Manny Ramirez joining the Boston Red Sox in 2001 and Jim Thome joining the Philadelphia Phillies in 2003. The 1997 Indians failed to end the Cleveland sports curse, which stood at 33 years since the 1964 Cleveland Browns won the city&#x27;s most recent championship. The Curse would eventually end in 2016, when the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA Title, giving the city its first major sports title in 52 years.

The total attendance of 403,627 fans is the second-largest in World Series history. The high attendance is due to the fact that the series went the full seven games and the large seating capacity at Pro Player Stadium. All four games played in Miami had over 67,000 in attendance. This Series only trails the 1959 World Series, which drew 420,784 spectators. That Series had three of its six games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and drew over 92,000 for each game played at the Coliseum.

Edgar Rentería, the player who drove in the winning run to win the World Series for the Marlins, would win a World Series MVP later in his career, with the San Francisco Giants in 2010.

==Radio and television coverage==
NBC, as per the terms of the then-current broadcasting contract, televised the World Series nationally. It was the first World Series telecast to air exclusively on NBC since 1988; they were originally scheduled to air the 1995 World Series alone as part of its joint venture with ABC and Major League Baseball dubbed The Baseball Network, but the 1994 strike cancelled that year&#x27;s World Series and NBC and ABC ultimately alternated coverage of the 1995 World Series. Bob Costas led the broadcast, with Bob Uecker and Joe Morgan as analysts. Hannah Storm and Keith Olbermann hosted the pregame show, with Olbermann and Jim Gray serving as field reporters for the respective teams. Storm and Gray presided over the on-field celebration after Game 7.

CBS Radio, which had covered the World Series consecutively since , did so for the final time in 1997. The national radio broadcasting rights would move over to ESPN the following season. Vin Scully, in what would prove to be his last World Series call before he retired in 2016, was the lead broadcaster for the eleventh time for CBS. Jeff Torborg joined Scully as analyst, making his third and final appearance. John Rooney hosted the studio segments for the series for the eleventh consecutive World Series.

This was the last World Series for Indians Radio Network announcer Herb Score, as he retired at season&#x27;s end. Score&#x27;s broadcast partner, Tom Hamilton, would take over as lead announcer and he remains in that position as of the 2024 season. It also marked the final game carried by Indians flagship station WKNR (1220); the broadcast rights would be moved to WTAM for the 1998 season.

<doc id="536029" wikidata="Q2913219" url="?curid=536029" title="Battleaxe (band)">
<text>Battleaxe are an English heavy metal band from Sunderland. As one of the bands of the new wave of British heavy metal scene, they started out with the name Warrior and morphed into Battleaxe in early 1981. The band consisted of Dave King (vocals), Brian Smith (bass), Steve Hardy (guitar), and Ian Thompson (drums). After playing around the area and honing their craft, they entered the recording studio to make a demo called &quot;Burn This Town&quot;. In doing so, they garnered the attention of Roadrunner Records, and the result was their first album, &quot;Burn This Town&quot;.

== Cover art controversy ==
Once a release deal had been struck with Roadrunner Records, the master tapes were forwarded to the record production and the album title &quot;Burn this Town&quot; was created. The company requested some concept ideas for the cover artwork, so the band asked a friend and local artist Arthur Ball if he could come up with suggestions. He then produced the first &quot;Burn this Town&quot; cover artwork as it is known now, however only as a rough proof drawing. Arthur planned to re-draw the whole thing again to a much higher standard once it was to be approved by the record company. However, when Roadrunner received the proof artwork for approval, they went ahead and pressed 2000 units for a worldwide release without the band&#x27;s consent. The graphic looked amateurish, and the band worried what this might do to their reputation. However, the album sold well. The band began developing a reputation in the region as a solid heavy metal outfit.

== Changing of &quot;Ians&quot; ==
A short time after finishing the recordings of the album &quot;Burn This Town&quot; at Guardian studios County Durham, Ian Thompson was badly injured with a skull fracture when attacked by someone with an iron bar. Thompson&#x27;s injuries were extensive and required a long time to heal. During this time, the band&#x27;s momentum was still growing as they were signed by Roadrunner Records and contracted to complete a second album by the end of the year. Ian McCormack, Satan&#x27;s ex-drummer, was asked to fill the drum position until Thomson had recovered. However, when &quot;Power from the Universe&quot; was released on both the Roadrunner and Music for Nations labels, the band suddenly found themselves garnering unexpected fame. Listeners stated that this album showed a more refined and mature sound, and the album was voted as having one of the best heavy metal openers of the time with the song &quot;Chopper Attack&quot;. Battleaxe continued on with the same lineup to complete a BBC Radio One Session on the Tommy Vance Friday Rock show. They were included in a nationwide tour supporting Saxon, and invited to a Leeds Queens Hall Festival with Twisted Sister, Girlschool, Anvil, Spyder and Plus.

== Personnel changes ==
On the eve of a major appearance at Hammersmith Odeon London in support of Saxon on their Crusader tour, some A&amp;R staff from Atlantic Records were showing interest. After the show, they wanted the band to organize a showcase for them. However, Steve Hardy unexpectedly quit, and they had to pull out of what could have been a major signing. It took almost two years before a new lineup was found that was somewhere near the quality and spirit to what they had. This was a severe blow to their career and put the band on hold until they could regain their footing. They toured the UK in support of Madam X, who had to pull out of the tour due to an illness, leaving Battleaxe to headline. They finished the tour at the Dominion Theatre in London.

The new lineup included Mick Percy and John Stormont. Their lead and rhythm guitar combination gave band&#x27;s performances a fuller sound live as well as in the studio. Soon after, they went into Neat Records studio to record the tracks &quot;Radio Thunder,&quot; &quot;Girl Crazee,&quot; and &quot;Killer Woman.&quot; These tracks were added to their 1987 EP, &quot;Nightmare Zone&quot;. John Stormont contributed a lead break performance on the track &quot;Killer Woman.&quot; John left the band and there was a rotating door of musicians until 1987 when they recruited Jason Holt on guitar and Stew Curtan on drums (after Ian McCormack retired). During this period of instability, the band met drummer Paul AT Kinson from Newcastle, who filled in now and then but didn&#x27;t officially join the band until a later date. With this lineup, their sound had strengthened, becoming more powerful and adding versatility that was not possible with one guitarist. However, this new lineup lasted only a short time as it became hard for Battleaxe to tour. Metallica, who had recently appearing on the metal scene, wanted to tour the UK and Europe with Battleaxe but changed their minds because of politics. However, Battleaxe was added to a compilation album with Metallica, Manowar, and other major bands. From 1995-1998, the band hired another guitarist for a short while and did a one-off show to a small audience at Klenal Hall Biker&#x27;s Festival. Plans were made to record a third album, and they went into the studio to record the demos that would become the &quot;Nightmare Zone&quot; EP. The third album was originally going to be called &quot;Metal Edge&quot;, but they were not able to secure interest from a record label, and the band began to lose interest. Due to financial limitations, touring and performing live gigs simultaneously was impossible. In 2007 the four piece, Mick Percy (guitar), Paul AT Kinson (ex Jess Cox/Skyclad/Bob Dee-USA) and the two founding members, Brian Smith (bass), and Dave King (vocal) (not the Fastaway vocalist Dave King) shot a video to the track Chopper Attack. The video appeared to relaunch the band onto the reemerging new wave of British heavy metal scene.

== Later developments ==
In 2008, some Swedish fans set up a website dedicated to Battleaxe, which caught the attention of a new generation of fans. In 2010, the band returned to the metal scene, performing their first live show in Europe at Headbangers Open Air.

In 2011 and 2012 the band played Hard Rock Hell (UK), Hammerfest (UK) and Heavy Metal Night (Italy).

Dave King and Brian Smith rejected an album deal with Limb Music (Germany).

Dave King and Brian Smith signed a four-album (re-release/new album) deal with SPV Steamhammer in 2013. For unknown reasons, drummer Paul AT Kinson and guitarist Mick Percy were written out of the contract.

They re-released the first two albums, &quot;Burn This Town&quot; and &quot;Power From The Universe,&quot; on the band&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary along with the third release of their newest album &quot;Heavy Metal Sanctuary.&quot; In 2020, SPV Steamhammer re-released &quot;Power from the Universe.&quot;

The first three albums received mixed reviews from around the world and a prominent rock journalist reviewed the re-release of &quot;Power From The Universe&quot;.

2014 saw the departure of drummer Paul AT Kinson following the Keep It True Festival (Germany). Kinson had worked with the band on various demos and small shows since the early 1990s. He also helped to relaunch the band along with Dave King between 2007 and 2014, and was the producer of two official videos for the band during that period, as well as the main producer and co-writer the 2014 album &quot;Heavy Metal Sanctuary&quot;.

Ricky Squires (ex Heavy Metal Kids etc.) joined Battleaxe, replacing Kinson on drums, in May 2014, prior to their debut show at Bloodstock Open Air Festival. However, the distance between Squires (living in Ayrshire) and the band in Newcastle upon Tyne, made it difficult to continue.

Battleaxe is using stand-in session drummer Steve Rix who played regularly with the late Chris Tsangarides (the band had planned to use Tsangarides to produce their new album in 2017/2018).

Gary Young (Avenger) stood in on drums for Battleaxe at metal festival BroFest (UK).

As of 2022, the band is working on a new album at White Wolf Recording Studios in County Durham. They hope to go back on tour in the future.

<doc id="536032" wikidata="Q3087172" url="?curid=536032" title="Developmental disorder">
<text>Developmental disorders comprise a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category &quot;Specific Disorders of Psychological Development&quot; in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise developmental language disorder, learning disorders, developmental coordination disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In broader definitions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability.

Developmental disorders are present from early life onward. Most improve as the child grows older, but some entail impairments that continue throughout life. These disorders differ from Pervasive developmental disorders (PPD), which uniquely describe a group of five developmental diagnoses, one of which is autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Pervasive developmental disorders reference a limited number of conditions whereas development disorders are a broad network of social, communicative, physical, genetic, intellectual, behavioral, and language concerns and diagnoses.
==Emergence==
Learning disabilities are often diagnosed when the children are young and just beginning school. Most learning disabilities are found under the age of 9.

Young children with communication disorders may not speak at all, or may have a limited vocabulary for their age. Some children with communication disorders have difficulty understanding simple directions or cannot name objects. Most children with communication disorders can speak by the time they enter school, however, they continue to have problems with communication. School-aged children often have problems understanding and formulating words. Teens may have more difficulty with understanding or expressing abstract ideas.

=== Causes ===
The scientific study of the causes of developmental disorders involves many theories. Some of the major differences between these theories involves whether environment disrupts normal development, if abnormalities are pre-determined, or if they are products of human evolutionary history which become disorders in modern environments (&quot;see evolutionary psychiatry&quot;).
Normal development occurs with a combination of contributions from both the environment and genetics. The theories vary in the part each factor has to play in normal development, thus affecting how the abnormalities are caused.

One theory that supports environmental causes of developmental disorders involves stress in early childhood. Researcher and child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry, M.D., Ph.D, theorizes that developmental disorders can be caused by early childhood traumatization. In his works, he compares developmental disorders in traumatized children to adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, linking extreme environmental stress to the cause of developmental difficulties. Other stress theories suggest that even small stresses can accumulate to result in emotional, behavioral, or social disorders in children.

A 2017 study tested all 20,000 genes in about 4,300 families with children with rare developmental difficulties in the UK and Ireland in order to identify if these difficulties had a genetic cause. They found 14 new developmental disorders caused by spontaneous genetic mutations not found in either parent (such as a fault in the CDK13 gene). They estimated that about one in 300 children are born with spontaneous genetic mutations associated with rare developmental disorders.

==Types==
===Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)===
====Diagnosis====
The first diagnosed case of ASD was published in 1943 by American psychiatrist Leo Kanner. There is a wide range of cases and severity to ASD so it is very hard to detect the first signs of ASD. A diagnosis of ASD can be made accurately before the child is 3 years old, but the diagnosis of ASD is not commonly confirmed until the child is somewhat older. The age of diagnosis can range from 9 months to 14 years, and the mean age is 4 years old in the USA. On average each case of ASD is tested at three different diagnostic centers before confirmed. Early diagnosis of the disorder can diminish familial stress, speed up referral to special educational programs and influence family planning. The occurrence of ASD in one child can increase the risk of the next child having ASD by 50 to 100 times.

====Abnormalities in the brain====
The cause of ASD is still uncertain. What is known is that a child with ASD has a pervasive problem with how the brain is wired. Genes related to neurotransmitter receptors (serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) and CNS structural control (&quot;HOX&quot; genes) are found to be potential target genes that get affected in ASD. Autism spectrum disorder is a disorder of the many parts of the brain. Structural changes are observed in the cortex, which controls higher functions, sensation, muscle movements, and memory. Structural defects are seen in the cerebellum too, which affect the motor and communication skills. Sometimes the left lobe of the brain is affected and this causes neuropsychological symptoms. The distribution of white matter, the nerve fibers that link diverse parts of the brain, is abnormal. The corpus callosum, the band of nerve fibers, that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain also gets affected in ASD. A study also found that 33% of people who have AgCC (agenesis of the corpus callosum), a condition in which the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent, had scores higher than the autism screening cut-off.

An ASD child&#x27;s brain grows at a very rapid rate and is almost fully grown by the age of 10. Recent fMRI studies have also found altered connectivity within the social brain areas due to ASD and may be related to the social impairments encountered in ASD.

====Symptoms====
The symptoms have a wide range of severity. The symptoms of ASD can be broadly categorised as the following:

===== Persistent issues in social interactions and communications =====
These are predominantly seen by unresponsiveness in conversations, lesser emotional sharing, inability to initiate conversations, inability to interpret body language, avoidance of eye-contact and difficulty maintaining relationships.

===== Repetitive behavioral patterns =====
These patterns can be seen in the form of repeated movements of the hand or the phrases used while talking. A rigid adherence to schedules and inflexibility to adapt even if a minor change is made to their routine is also one of the behavioral symptoms of ASD. They could also display sensory patterns such as extreme aversion to certain odors or indifference to pain or temperature.

There are also different symptoms at different ages based on developmental milestones. Children between 0 and 36 months with ASD show a lack of eye contact, seem to be deaf, lack a social smile, do not like being touched or held, have unusual sensory behavior and show a lack of imitation. Children between 12 and 24 months with ASD show a lack of gestures, prefer to be alone, do not point to objects to indicate interest, are easily frustrated with challenges, and lack of functional play. And finally children between the ages 24 to 36 months with ASD show a lack of symbolic play and an unusual interest in certain objects, or moving objects.

====Treatment====
There is no specific treatment for autism spectrum disorders, but there are several types of therapy effective in easing the symptoms of autism, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), Speech-language therapy, Occupational therapy or Sensory integration therapy.

Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) is considered the most effective therapy for Autism spectrum disorders by the American Academy of Pediatrics. ABA focuses on teaching adaptive behaviors like social skills, play skills, or communication skills and diminishing problematic behaviors like self-injury. This is done by creating a specialized plan that uses behavioral therapy techniques, such as positive or negative reinforcement, to encourage or discourage certain behaviors over-time.

Occupational therapy helps autistic children and adults learn everyday skills that help them with daily tasks, such as personal hygiene and movement. These skills are then integrated into their home, school, and work environments. Therapists will oftentimes help patients learn to adapt their environment to their skill level. This type of therapy could help autistic people become more engaged in their environment. An occupational therapist will create a plan based on the patient&#x27;s needs and desires and work with them to achieve their set goals.

Speech-language therapy can help those with autism who need to develop or improve communication skills. According to the organization Autism Speaks, “speech-language therapy is designed to coordinate the mechanics of speech with the meaning and social use of speech”. People with low-functioning autism may not be able to communicate with spoken words. Speech-language Pathologists (SLP) may teach someone how to communicate more effectively with others or work on starting to develop speech patterns. The SLP will create a plan that focuses on what the child needs.

Sensory integration therapy helps people with autism adapt to different kinds of sensory stimuli. Many children with autism can be oversensitive to certain stimuli, such as lights or sounds, causing them to overreact. Others may not react to certain stimuli, such as someone speaking to them. Many types of therapy activities involve a form of play, such as using swings, toys and trampolines to help engage the patients with sensory stimuli. Therapists will create a plan that focuses on the type of stimulation the person needs integration with.

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)===
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs in early childhood. ADHD affects 8 to 11% of children in the school going age. ADHD is characterised by significant levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsiveness. There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive, and combined (which presents as both hyperactive and inattentive subtypes). ADHD is twice as common in boys than girls but it is seen that the hyperactive/impulsive type is more common in boys while the inattentive type affects both sexes equally.

====Symptoms====
Symptoms of ADHD include inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. Many of the behaviors that are associated with ADHD include poor control over actions resulting in disruptive behavior and academic problems. Another area that is affected by these disorders is the social arena for the person with the disorder. Many children that have this disorder exhibit poor interpersonal relationships and struggle to fit in socially with their peers. Behavioral study of these children can show a history of other symptoms such as temper tantrums, mood swings, sleep disturbances and aggressiveness.

==== Treatment options ====
The treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) commonly involves a multimodal approach, combining various strategies to address the complex nature of the disorder. This comprehensive approach includes psychological, behavioral, pharmaceutical, and educational interventions tailored to the individual&#x27;s specific needs. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the different components:

*Psychological Interventions:
**Counseling and Psychoeducation - Individuals with ADHD may benefit from counseling sessions that provide a safe space to discuss challenges, develop coping strategies, and improve self-esteem. **Psychoeducation helps individuals and their families understand the nature of ADHD and learn effective management techniques.
**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - CBT aims to modify negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with ADHD. It helps individuals develop organizational skills, time management, and problem-solving abilities.

*Behavioral Interventions:
**Parent Training - Parents often participate in training programs to learn behavior management techniques. This may involve setting clear expectations, using positive reinforcement, and implementing consistent consequences for behavior.
**Behavioral Modification Programs - These programs focus on shaping positive behaviors and reducing impulsive or disruptive behaviors in various settings, including home and school.

*Pharmaceutical Interventions:
**Stimulant Medications - Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate (e.g., Ritalin) and amphetamines (e.g., Adderall), are commonly prescribed to manage symptoms of ADHD. These medications enhance the activity of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, helping to improve attention and impulse control.
**Non-stimulant Medications - In cases where stimulants are not suitable or effective, non-stimulant medications like atomoxetine (Strattera) or guanfacine (Intuniv) may be prescribed.

*Educational Interventions:
**Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) - In educational settings, IEPs are developed to accommodate the unique learning needs of students with ADHD. This may involve classroom modifications, additional support, and specific teaching strategies.
**504 Plans - These plans outline accommodations for students with ADHD in mainstream educational settings, such as extended test-taking time or preferential seating.

The effectiveness of the treatment plan depends on the individual&#x27;s specific challenges and responses to interventions. A collaborative and multidisciplinary approach involving parents, educators, mental health professionals, and healthcare providers is crucial for developing and implementing a successful ADHD management plan. Regular monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary to meet the evolving needs of individuals with ADHD.

===== Behavioral therapy =====
Sessions of counselling, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), making environmental changes in noise and visual stimulation are some behavioral management techniques followed. But it has been observed that behavioral therapy alone is less effective than therapy with stimulant drugs alone.

===== Drug therapy =====
Medications commonly utilized in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include stimulants like methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine, as well as non-stimulants such as atomoxetine. These medications can effectively manage ADHD symptoms by targeting neurotransmitter imbalances. However, it is important to be aware of potential side effects associated with these medications. Common side effects may include headaches, which can often be mitigated by adjusting the dosage or administration timing. Gastrointestinal discomfort, including stomach pain or nausea, is another possible side effect, and taking the medication with food or modifying the dosage may help alleviate these symptoms. Additionally, while rare, changes in mood such as feelings of depression have been reported. Careful monitoring and communication with healthcare providers are essential to address and manage any side effects, ensuring the overall effectiveness and well-being of individuals undergoing ADHD treatments.

SSRI antidepressants may be unhelpful, and could worsen symptoms of ADHD. However ADHD is often misdiagnosed as depression, particularly when no hyperactivity is present.

<text>The Convair R3Y Tradewind was an American 1950s turboprop-powered flying boat designed and built by Convair.

==Design and development==

Convair received a request from the United States Navy in 1945 for the design of a large flying boat using new technology developed during World War II, especially the laminar flow wing and still-developing turboprop technology. Their response was the Model 117. It was a large high-wing flying boat with Allison T40 engines driving six-bladed contra-rotating propellers. It had a sleek body with a single-step hull and a slender high-lift wing with fixed floats. The Navy ordered two prototypes on 27 May 1946. Designated XP5Y-1, the first aircraft first flew on 18 April 1950 at San Diego. In August the aircraft set a turboprop endurance record of eight hours six minutes. The Navy decided not to proceed with the patrol boat version, instead directing that the design should be developed into a passenger and cargo aircraft.

One of the XP5Y-1 prototypes was lost in a non-fatal accident on 15 July 1953, while design and development continued on the passenger and cargo version of the aircraft. The transport and cargo version was designated the R3Y-1 Tradewind and first flew on 25 February 1954. Major changes were the removal of all armament and of the tailplane dihederal, the addition of a 10 ft (3.05 m) port-side access hatch, and redesigned engine nacelles to accept improved T40-A-10 engines. Cabin soundproofing and air conditioning were added for pressurized accommodation for 103 passengers or 24 tons of cargo. As a medevac aircraft, 92 stretcher cases could be carried.
A total of eleven aircraft were built. The first two prototypes built were in P5Y configuration, armed with 8,000 lb (3,600 kg) of munitions (bombs, mines, depth charges, torpedoes) and five pairs of 20 mm cannon in fore and aft side emplacements and a tail turret. The next five were built as R3Y-1 aircraft, intended for troop transport and inflight refueling tanker service. The final six were built as the R3Y-2 variant with a lifting nose and high cockpit (similar in concept to the C-5 Galaxy&#x27;s nose and cockpit) for heavier transport and landing-ship duties.

The front-loading R3Y-2 aircraft with a hinged nose and high cockpit were intended to be a &quot;Flying LST&quot; (landing craft). In practice, it was discovered that it was almost impossible for the pilots to hold the aircraft steady and nose on to the beach while the aircraft was loaded or unloaded. The aircraft were converted into tankers for the inflight refueling role. They had a short service life due to unsolvable reliability problems of their Allison T40 turboprop engines, a fate common to most T40-powered aircraft, such as the Douglas A2D Skyshark attack aircraft.

==Operational service==

The R3Y set a transcontinental seaplane record of in 1954 by utilizing the speed of high-altitude jetstream winds. This record still stands.

After service trials the aircraft were delivered to a U.S. Navy air transport squadron, VR-2, on 31 March 1956. Problems with the engine/propeller combination led to the ending of Tradewind operations and the unit was disbanded on 16 April 1958.

The six R3Y-2s were converted into four-point in-flight tankers using the probe-and-drogue method. In September 1956 one example was the first aircraft to successfully refuel four others simultaneously in flight in 1956, refueling four Grumman F9F Cougars.

The program was halted after thirteen aircraft were built, the reason being the unreliability of the Allison T-40 turboprops. The crash of one of the two XP5Y-1 aircraft was judged due to catastrophic engine failure; when little progress was made with the engine problems, the Navy halted the program. Subsequently, three more aircraft were lost through engine failures, and the Navy gave up on the T-40 and aircraft powered by it. All the P5Y and R3Y aircraft were grounded in 1958 and subsequently broken up.

<text>George Bailey is a fictional character and the protagonist in Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. The character is a building and loan banker who sacrifices his dreams in order to help his community of Bedford Falls to the point where he feels life has passed him by. Eventually, due to difficulties in keeping the building and loan solvent, Bailey falls into despair so deep that he contemplates suicide, until a guardian angel, Clarence Odbody, gives him a valuable perspective on the worth of his life. George finds through Odbody&#x27;s angelic power and gift what the lives of his family and friends and the social structure of Bedford Falls would be like without him. 

Bailey is played by James Stewart as an adult and Bobby Anderson as a child, and is loosely based on George Pratt, a character in Philip Van Doren Stern&#x27;s 1943 booklet &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;.

The character was portrayed by Pete Davidson in a 2020 television special.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===
In the winter of 1919, George (aged 12, played by Bobby Anderson) and his friends Bert, Ernie Bishop, Marty Hatch, Sam Wainwright, and his brother Harry are sledding on a frozen river. Harry breaks through the ice and George jumps into the freezing water to save him. In doing so, George became ill with an infection that waylaid him for some time and caused him to lose hearing in his left ear.
In May 1920, George returns to his after school job at Mr. Gower&#x27;s drugstore, where he first attends to the soda fountain when two customers are Marty’s sister Mary and her friend Violet Bick. George announces his plan to be an explorer and travel the world, citing &quot;National Geographic&quot; as an inspiration where Mary whispers her love for George in his deaf ear. George then finds a telegram informing Gower that his son has died in the Spanish flu pandemic. A visibly distraught Gower directs George to deliver medicine to a customer, but George realizes that, in his distress, he had inadvertently put poison into the capsules. He seeks advice from his father, who is president of the Bailey Brothers Building &amp; Loan, but his father is meeting with Henry F. Potter, one of the shareholders. When he returns to the store, Gower angrily berates him for not delivering the capsules, until George blurts out Gower&#x27;s mistake. Realizing this would have been fatal, Gower tearfully thanks George, who promises that he will never tell anyone what happened.

===Young adult===
In June 1928, George (played by James Stewart) is preparing for an overseas trip. He gets invited to Harry&#x27;s graduation party. Before going George talks with his father about his plans for the future, in which architecture has replaced exploring, but he still desires to leave Bedford Falls and see the world. Peter Bailey explains that the work they have done in the building &amp; loan is a way to make their mark on the world, but endorses George&#x27;s decision to leave town &quot;if he is unwilling to crawl to Potter&quot;. At the high school, he meets up with Marty, who reintroduces him to Mary, now a teenager. A rival suitor of Mary&#x27;s attempts to embarrass George by dunking him into a swimming pool situated beneath the dance floor, but George and Mary take it in stride and the partygoers consider it a splash. While walking Mary home they are interrupted by Uncle Billy, who comes by in a car and says that George is needed as his father has had a stroke.

Three months later August, George is in a meeting with the board of directors of the Building &amp; Loan to appoint a new successor to the late Peter Bailey. Potter argues that the Building &amp; Loan should be dissolved, whereas George recommends his father be succeeded by his brother Billy. The directors tell George that the Building &amp; Loan will only stay open if he agrees to remain and carry on his father&#x27;s work. George foregoes a trip to Europe and his plans for college, giving the funds saved toward tuition to his younger brother.

In 1932, George and Uncle Billy are waiting at the Bedford Falls railroad station for Harry to come home from college, when Harry arrives with his new wife, Ruth. Her father has offered Harry a job, which means he would not be taking George&#x27;s place at the Building &amp; Loan. Harry says that he will keep his promise to allow George his chance at the university. However, George cannot bear to allow his brother to throw away such an opportunity, so he remains in Bedford Falls. While the family is celebrating Harry&#x27;s return, Ma Bailey mentions to George that Mary Hatch is also back from college and he should pay her a visit. He eventually goes to Mary&#x27;s home to visit her, only to find that she is being courted by his friend, the now wealthy Sam Wainwright. However, George is encouraged to pursue Mary by Mrs. Bailey, who has concurred with Mrs. Hatch that while Sam would be a good provider, his constant absence would be problematic for Mary.

===Pre-war===

A few months later, George and Mary are married. Their plans for a honeymoon in New York City and Bermuda are interrupted by a run on the banks which also affects the Building &amp; Loan. Potter&#x27;s bank calls their loan, and panicked depositors want their money, threatening to take their business to the bank. As a stockholder, Potter threatens to shut the Building &amp; Loan if they are forced to close early. Mary and George use the money saved for their honeymoon to keep the Building &amp; Loan solvent.

In 1934, thanks to the Building &amp; Loan, the Martini family move out of &#x27;Potter&#x27;s Field&#x27; to the new &#x27;Bailey Park&#x27;, (this home is the only original building from the movie that still exists) a residential development created by George that proves successful enough to seriously threaten Mr. Potter&#x27;s rental interests. Potter offers George a job. Although this would bring a significant increase in social status and salary, as well as opportunities for travel, George declines. George returns home to learn that Mary is pregnant. Their first child is a son, whom they name Peter after George&#x27;s late father. Their second child is a daughter, Janie.

===The war years===

;1939–1945

During the war years, George and Mary had another two children, a daughter nicknamed &quot;ZuZu&quot; and a son, Thomas. George was classified 4-F by the draft board due to his ear. Ernie became a paratrooper and parachuted into France on D-Day. Marty helped capture the Bridge at Remagen, Sam produced plastic hoods for planes, and Bert went to Africa to fight, where he was wounded and eventually got the Purple Heart and Silver Star. While all of this happened, George served as an Air Raid Warden. Despite having to look after four children, Mary still had time to run the United Service Organizations in the town, and Mr. Potter became head of the draft board. It was Harry Bailey who had the crowning achievement of Bedford Falls. Harry, who became a Navy pilot, engaged in a risky interception of a kamikaze that was about to attack an Army transport, saving the lives of fifteen soldiers, to which he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

===Post war===

;Christmas Eve 1945

On Christmas Eve morning, Uncle Billy is on his way to the bank to deposit $8,000 of the Building &amp; Loan&#x27;s cash funds (the equivalent of $140,219.11 in 2024). Holding a newspaper which has Harry on the front page, he greets Potter and taunts him about Harry’s success in the war. Potter angrily snatches the paper, but Billy inattentively allows the money to be snatched with it. Potter notices the money and keeps it, knowing that misplacement of bank money would result in bankruptcy for the Building &amp; Loan and criminal charges for George. Confused and embarrassed, Billy tells George that he has misplaced the money, and doesn&#x27;t know where it is. George is extremely worried, especially with the bank examiner just outside the room. George and Billy go through the town taking every step Billy took in the morning and it goes to a dead end. George later goes home, and Mary knows straight away something is wrong with him. To add to his anger, he finds out his youngest daughter Zuzu has come home with a cold, which George blames on her teacher. When the teacher calls, he berates her on the phone. His frustration culminates into smashing models of bridges and buildings he had made in his earlier years. 
A desperate George appeals to Potter for a loan. Potter sarcastically turns George down, and then swears out a warrant for his arrest for bank fraud. George, now completely depressed, gets drunk at the bar owned by his friend, Martini, where he silently prays for help. He also gets a punch to the face from the husband of Zuzu&#x27;s teacher, who is drinking there. The belligerent husband gets thrown out by Mr. Martini, the bar&#x27;s owner and the patriarch of one of the families who moved into Bailey Park. Mr. Martini angrily says that any man who would raise his fists to George is never welcome here. George drunkenly drives his car into a tree and comes to a bridge intending to commit suicide, feeling he is &quot;worth more dead than alive&quot;, echoing Potter&#x27;s mocking of George&#x27;s life insurance policy. Before he can leap, another man jumps in first and pretends to be drowning. After George rescues him, the man reveals himself to be George&#x27;s guardian angel, Clarence Odbody. George does not believe him, and he bitterly wishes he had never been born. Inspired by this comment, Clarence shows George what the town would have been like without him. 

;Alternate Universe
In this alternative scenario, Bedford Falls is instead named Pottersville, and is home to sleazy nightclubs, pawn shops, and amoral people. The bar George frequented is now run by Nick, whom George knew as a bartender to Martini, but now has a gruff personality. Mr. Gower was sent to prison for poisoning the child and is despised and homeless. George&#x27;s friend Violet Bick is a taxi-dancer who gets arrested. Bert is still a policeman, albeit with a darker personality and more brutal in his duties. Ernie still works as a taxi driver, but now desperately poor due to divorce and his family forsaking him. Uncle Billy has been in an insane asylum since he lost his brother and the family business. George&#x27;s own mother, a woman defeated by the world, fails to recognize him. George then goes to Bailey Park, which is now a cemetery. Harry is dead as a result of George not being there to save him from drowning, resulting in the deaths of the servicemen not saved by Harry&#x27;s heroism. (A deleted scene exists in which George learns why the bar is Nick&#x27;s and not Martini&#x27;s; George finds the graves of the Martini family near Harry&#x27;s and realizes the family perished in a tenement blaze as George was unable to provide them affordable housing to move out of Potter&#x27;s slums.) Mary is a shy spinster who works at the public library. When George desperately tries to convince her he is her husband, she considers it creepy and intimidating and yells for help. Her cries are answered by Bert, who thinks nothing of opening fire on George as he flees.

;Return to Life

George runs back to the bridge and begs to be allowed to live again. Bert shows up at the bridge. When Bert is not there to arrest him but glad he has found him as everyone was worried to his whereabouts, George joyously hugs Bert then runs home. Running through town, George is overjoyed to see it is once again Bedford Falls and wishes everyone he passes a Merry Christmas, even Mr. Potter. Mary, Uncle Billy, and a flood of townspeople arrive with more than enough donations to save George and the Building &amp; Loan; Sam Wainwright extends a $25,000 line of credit by telegram (the equivalent of $438,184.72 in 2024). As they celebrate, the town&#x27;s sheriff tears the warrant for his arrest and joins in the festivities. Harry also arrives to support his brother, and toasts George as &quot;The richest man in town.” In the pile of donated funds, George finds a copy of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; inscribed, &quot;Dear George: Remember, no man is a failure who has friends. P.S. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence.&quot; A bell on the Christmas tree rings, and his daughter Zuzu says, &quot;Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings!&quot; George agrees and looks up to Heaven, realizing that he truly has a wonderful life.

==Contemporary reception==

Bosley Crowther, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described Bailey as &quot;a young fellow who wants to break away from his small-town life and responsibilities but is never able to do so because slowly they close in upon him&quot;. Crowther said Frank Capra&#x27;s character as &quot;a personable fellow who wants to travel and do big things but ultimately finds himself running a building-and-loan association in a one-horse town, married and locked in constant struggle with the greedy old banker of the town&quot;. Kate Cameron of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described Bailey as a &quot;guy who wished he had never been born, when the going gets too tough, and was permitted to see what his home town would have been like without him&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Bert Briller wrote, &quot;At 30 a small-town citizen feels he has reached the end of his rope, mentally, morally, financially.&quot; Briller said of the guardian angel showing him the impact of his life, &quot;The recounting of this life is just about flawless in its tender and natural treatment.&quot;

Crowther commended James Stewart&#x27;s performance as Bailey, &quot;As the hero, Mr. Stewart does a warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war.&quot; Cameron said, &quot;[Stewart] carries most of the burden of this long picture on his still slender shoulders and for the most part gives an endearing performance.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Jack D. Grant wrote, &quot;James Stewart is distinctively Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, his initial role in Hollywood after five years in the armed forces.&quot;

==Analysis==
A large number of interpretations of &quot;It’s a Wonderful Life&quot; have been advanced, and as George Bailey is the protagonist, many of those interpretations hinge on interpretations of his role in the film. Bailey is conventionally interpreted as the hero of the film, and he was listed ninth on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2003 list of the 50 greatest screen heroes. While the film shows some obvious instances of heroic behavior in Bailey’s youth, such as saving his brother Harry from drowning and preventing Mr. Gower from poisoning a customer, doubts about the worth of Bailey’s adulthood actions turn into the central question of his life. Bailey’s deficiencies as a hero are highlighted by the facts that the film’s climactic scene portrays Bailey as the person being rescued and that “Capra was forced to invoke a deus ex machina, a guardian angel, to convince Bailey of the worth of his life.”

Citing generosity as Bailey&#x27;s most admirable trait, &quot;Time&quot; magazine lists George Bailey among their top ten movie dads.

<doc id="536059" wikidata="Q459297" url="?curid=536059" title="Qanat">
<text>A qanāt () or kārīz () is a water supply system that was developed in ancient Iran for the purpose of transporting usable water to the surface from an aquifer or a well through an underground aqueduct. Originating approximately 3,000 years ago, its function is essentially the same across the Middle East and North Africa, but it is known by a variety of regional names beyond today&#x27;s Iran, including: kārēz in Afghanistan and Pakistan; foggāra in Algeria; khettāra in Morocco; falaj in Oman and the United Arab Emirates; and ʿuyūn in Saudi Arabia. In addition to those in Iran, the largest extant and functional qanats are located in Afghanistan, Algeria, China (i.e., the Turpan water system), Oman, and Pakistan.

Proving crucial to water supply in areas with hot and dry climates, a qanat enables water to be transported over long distances by largely eliminating the risk of much of it evaporating on the journey. The system also has the advantage of being fairly resistant to natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, as well as to man-made disasters, such as wartime destruction and water supply terrorism. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to varying levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years.

The typical design of a qanat is that of a series of well-like vertical shafts, which are all connected by a gently sloping tunnel. This taps into groundwater and delivers it to the surface via gravity, therefore eliminating the need for pumping. The vertical shafts along the underground channel are for maintenance purposes, and water is typically used only once it emerges from the daylight point.

To date, the qanat system still ensures a reliable supply of water for consumption and irrigation across human settlements in hot, arid, and semi-arid climates, but its value to a population is directly related to the quality, volume, and regularity of the groundwater in the inhabited region. Since their adoption outside of the Iranian mainland in antiquity, qanats have come to be heavily relied upon by much of the Middle Eastern and North African populations for sustenance. Likewise, many of the continuously inhabited settlements in these regions are established in areas where conditions have historically been favourable for creating and sustaining a qanat system.


== Names ==
Common variants of &quot;&quot; in English include &quot;kanat&quot;, &quot;khanat&quot;, &quot;kunut&quot;, &quot;kona&quot;, &quot;konait&quot;, &quot;ghanat&quot;, &quot;ghundat&quot;.

 () is an Arabic word that means &quot;channel&quot;. In Persian, the words for &quot;qanat&quot; are &#x27; (or &#x27;; ) and is derived from earlier word (). The word () is also used in Persian. Other names for qanat include (); (Balochi); (Azerbaijan); (Morocco); , or (Spain); () (United Arab Emirates and Oman); (North Africa). Alternative terms for qanats in Asia and North Africa are &quot;kakuriz&quot;, &quot;chin-avulz&quot;, and &quot;mayun&quot;.

== Origins ==
According to most sources, qanat technology was developed by the ancient Iranians sometime in the early 1st millennium BCE and slowly spread westward and eastward from there. Other sources suggest a Southeast Arabian origin. Analogous systems appear to have been developed independently in China and in South America (specifically, southern Peru).

A cotton species, &quot;Gossypium arboreum&quot;, is indigenous to South Asia and has been cultivated on the Indian subcontinent for a long time. Cotton appears in the &quot;Inquiry into Plants&quot; by Theophrastus and is mentioned in the Laws of Manu. As transregional trade networks expanded and intensified, cotton spread from its homeland to India and into the Middle East. One theory is that the qanat was developed to irrigate cotton fields, first in what is now Iran, where it doubled the amount of available water for irrigation and urban use. Because of this, Persia enjoyed larger surpluses of agricultural products, thus increasing urbanization and social stratification. The qanat technology subsequently spread from Persia westward and eastward.

In the arid coastal desert of Peru, a technology of water supply similar to that of the qanats, called puquios, was developed. Most archaeologists believe that the puquios are indigenous and date to about 500 CE, but a few believe they are of Spanish origin, brought to the Americas in the 16th century. Puquios were still in use in the Nazca region in the 21st century.

==Features==


Qanats are constructed as a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by a gently sloping tunnel which carries a water canal. Qanats efficiently deliver large amounts of subterranean water to the surface without need for pumping. The water drains by gravity, typically from an upland aquifer, with the destination lower than the source. Qanats allow water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without much water loss to evaporation.

It is very common for a qanat to start below the foothills of mountains, where the water table is closest to the surface. From this source, the qanat tunnel slopes gently downward, slowly converging with the steeper slope of the land surface above, and the water finally flows out above ground where the two levels meet. To connect a populated or agricultural area with an aquifer, qanats must often extend for long distances.

Qanats are sometimes split into an underground distribution network of smaller canals called kariz. Like qanats, these smaller canals are below ground to avoid contamination and evaporation. In some cases water from a qanat is stored in a reservoir, typically with night flow stored for daytime use. An ab anbar is an example of a traditional Persian qanat-fed reservoir for drinking water.

The qanat system has the advantage of being resistant to natural disasters such as floods, and to deliberate destruction in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years. From a sustainability perspective, qanats are powered only by gravity and thus have low operation and maintenance costs. Qanats transfer fresh water from the mountain plateau to the lower-lying plains with saltier soil. This helps to control soil salinity and prevent desertification.

The qanat should not be confused with the spring-flow tunnel typical to the mountainous area around Jerusalem. Although both are excavated tunnels designed to extract water by gravity flow, there are crucial differences. Firstly, the origin of the qanat was a well that was turned into an artificial spring. In contrast, the origin of the spring-flow tunnel was the development of a natural spring to renew or increase flow following a recession of the water table. Secondly, the shafts essential for the construction of qanats are not essential to spring-flow tunnels.

== Impact on settlement patterns ==
A typical town or city in Iran, and elsewhere where the qanat is used, has more than one qanat. Fields and gardens are located both over the qanats a short distance before they emerge from the ground and below the surface outlet. Water from the qanats define both the social regions in the city and the layout of the city.

The water is freshest, cleanest, and coolest in the upper reaches, and more prosperous people live at the outlet or immediately upstream of the outlet. When the qanat is still below ground, the water is drawn to the surface via wells or animal driven Persian wells. Private subterranean reservoirs could supply houses and buildings for domestic use and garden irrigation as well. Air flow from the qanat is used to cool an underground summer room (shabestan) found in many older houses and buildings.

Downstream of the outlet, the water runs through surface canals called jubs (&quot;jūbs&quot;) which run downhill, with lateral branches to carry water to the neighborhood, gardens and fields. The streets normally parallel the jubs and their lateral branches. As a result, the cities and towns are oriented consistent with the gradient of the land; this is a practical response to efficient water distribution over varying terrain.

The lower reaches of the canals are less desirable for both residences and agriculture. The water grows progressively more polluted as it passes downstream. In dry years the lower reaches are the most likely to see substantial reductions in flow.

== Construction ==
Traditionally qanats are built by a group of skilled laborers, &quot;muqannīs&quot;, with hand labor. The profession historically paid well and was typically handed down from father to son.

=== Preparations ===
The critical, initial step in qanat construction is identification of an appropriate water source. The search begins at the point where the alluvial fan meets the mountains or foothills; water is more abundant in the mountains because of orographic lifting, and excavation in the alluvial fan is relatively easy. The &quot;muqannīs&quot; follow the track of the main water courses coming from the mountains or foothills to identify evidence of subsurface water such as deep-rooted vegetation or seasonal seeps. A trial well is then dug to determine the depth of the water table and determine whether a sufficient flow is available to justify construction. If these prerequisites are met, the route is laid out aboveground.

Equipment must be assembled. The equipment is straightforward: containers (usually leather bags), ropes, reels to raise the container to the surface at the shaft head, hatchets and shovels for excavation, lights, and spirit levels or plumb bobs and string. Depending upon the soil type, qanat liners (usually fired clay hoops) may also be required.

Although the construction methods are simple, the construction of a qanat requires a detailed understanding of subterranean geology and a degree of engineering sophistication. The gradient of the qanat must be carefully controlled: too shallow a gradient yields no flow and too steep a gradient will result in excessive erosion, collapsing the qanat. And misreading the soil conditions leads to collapses, which at best require extensive rework and at worst are fatal for the crew.

=== Excavation ===
Construction of a qanat is usually performed by a crew of 3–4 &quot;muqannīs&quot;. For a shallow qanat, one worker typically digs the horizontal shaft, one raises the excavated earth from the shaft and one distributes the excavated earth at the top.

The crew typically begins from the destination to which the water will be delivered into the soil and works toward the source (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated along the route, separated at a distance of . The separation of the shafts is a balance between the amount of work required to excavate them and the amount of effort required to excavate the space between them, as well as the ultimate maintenance effort. In general, the shallower the qanat, the closer the vertical shafts. If the qanat is long, excavation may begin from both ends at once. Tributary channels are sometimes also constructed to supplement the water flow.

Most qanats in Iran run less than , while some have been measured at ≈ in length near Kerman. The vertical shafts usually range from in depth, although qanats in the province of Khorasan have been recorded with vertical shafts of up to . The vertical shafts support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require intermediate platforms to facilitate the process of removing soil.

The construction speed depends on the depth and nature of the ground. If the earth is soft and easy to work, at depth a crew of four workers can excavate a horizontal length of per day. When the vertical shaft reaches , they can excavate only 20 meters horizontally per day and at in depth this drops below 5 horizontal meters per day. In Algeria, a common speed is just per day at a depth of . Deep, long qanats (which many are) require years and even decades to construct.

The excavated material is usually transported by means of leather bags up the vertical shafts. It is mounded around the vertical shaft exit, providing a barrier that prevents windblown or rain driven debris from entering the shafts. These mounds may be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From the air, these shafts look like a string of bomb craters.

The qanat&#x27;s water-carrying channel must have a sufficient downward slope that water flows easily. However the downward gradient must not be so great as to create conditions under which the water transitions between supercritical and subcritical flow. If this occurs, the waves that result can result in severe erosion that can damage or destroy the qanat. The choice of the slope is a trade off between erosion and sedimentation. Highly sloped tunnels are subject to more erosion as water flows at a higher speed. On the other hand, less sloped tunnels need frequent maintenance due to the problem of sedimentation. A lower downward gradient also contributes to reducing the solid contents and contamination in water. In shorter qanats the downward gradient varies between 1:1000 and 1:1500, while in longer qanats it may be almost horizontal. Such precision is routinely obtained with a spirit level and string.

In cases where the gradient is steeper, underground waterfalls may be constructed with appropriate design features (usually linings) to absorb the energy with minimal erosion. In some cases the water power has been harnessed to drive underground mills. If it is not possible to bring the outlet of the qanat out near the settlement, it is necessary to run a &quot;jub&quot; or canal overground. This is avoided when possible to limit pollution, warming and water loss due to evaporation.

=== Maintenance ===
The vertical shafts may be covered to minimize blown-in sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or cave-ins, cleaned of sand and mud and otherwise repaired. For safety, air flow must be assured before entry.

Some damaged qanats have been restored. To be sustainable, restoration needs to take into account many nontechnical factors beginning with the process of selecting the qanat to be restored. In Syria, three sites were chosen based on a national inventory conducted in 2001. One of them, the Drasiah qanat of Dmeir, was completed in 2002. Selection criteria included the availability of a steady groundwater flow, social cohesion and willingness to contribute of the community using the qanat, and the existence of a functioning water-rights system.

== Applications ==
The primary applications of qanats are for irrigation, providing cattle with water, and drinking water supply. Other applications include watermills, cooling and ice storage.
===Watermills===
Watermills within a qanat system had to be carefully situated, to make best use of the slow flow of water. In Iran, there were subterranean mills at Yazd and Boshruyeh; at Taft and Ardestan mills were placed at the outflow from the qanat, before irrigation of the fields.

=== Cooling ===

Qanats used in conjunction with a wind tower can provide cooling as well as a water supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house. The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see Bernoulli effect) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with it.

The air from the qanat is drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the transfer of latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15 °C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry, so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp). Wind tower and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1,000 years.

=== Ice storage ===

By 400 BCE, Persian engineers had mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert.

The ice could be brought in during the winters from nearby mountains, but in a more usual and sophisticated method they built a wall in the east–west direction near a yakhchal (ice pit). In winter, the qanat water would be channeled to the north side of the wall, whose shade made the water freeze more quickly, increasing the ice formed per winter day. Then the ice was stored in yakhchals—specially designed, naturally cooled refrigerators.

A large underground space with thick insulated walls was connected to a qanat, and a system of windcatchers or wind towers was used to draw cool subterranean air up from the qanat to maintain temperatures inside the space at low levels, even during hot summer days. As a result, the ice melted slowly and was available year-round.

== By country ==
=== Africa ===
==== Algeria ====
Qanats (designated foggaras in Algeria) are the source of water for irrigation in large oases like Gourara. The foggaras are also found at Touat (an area of Adrar 200 km from Gourara). The length of the foggaras in this region is estimated to be thousands of kilometers. Although sources suggest that the foggaras may have been in use as early as 200 CE, they were clearly in use by the 11th century after the Arabs took possession of the oases in the 10th century and the residents embraced Islam. The water is metered to the various users through the use of distribution weirs that meter flow to the various canals, each for a separate user.

The humidity of the oases is also used to supplement the water supply to the foggara. The temperature gradient in the vertical shafts causes air to rise by natural convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off. In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passes out of the vertical shafts. This condensed moisture is available for reuse.

==== Egypt ====
Qanat irrigation technology was introduced to Egypt by the Achaemenid king Darius I during his reign of 522 BCE-486 BCE, which is supported by the historian Albert T. Olmstead. There are four main oases in the Egyptian desert. The Kharga Oasis is one that has been extensively studied. There is evidence that as early as the second half of the 5th century BCE water brought in qanats was being used. The qanats were excavated through water-bearing sandstone rock, which seeps into the channel, with water collected in a basin behind a small dam at the end. The width is approximately , but the height ranges from 5 to 9 meters; it is likely that the qanat was deepened to enhance seepage when the water table dropped (as is also seen in Iran). From there the water was used to irrigate fields.

There is another instructive structure located at the Kharga Oasis. A well that apparently dried up was improved by driving a side shaft through the easily penetrated sandstone (presumably in the direction of greatest water seepage) into the hill of Ayn-Manâwîr (also written to allow collection of additional water. After this side shaft had been extended, another vertical shaft was driven to intersect the side shaft. Side chambers were built, and holes bored into the rock—presumably at points where water seeped from the rocks—are evident.

==== Libya ====
David Mattingly reports foggara extending for hundreds of miles in the Garamantes area near Germa in Libya: &quot;The channels were generally very narrow – less than 2 feet wide and 5 high – but some were several miles long, and in total some 600 foggara extended for hundreds of miles underground. The channels were dug out and maintained using a series of regularly spaced vertical shafts, one every 30 feet or so, 100,000 in total, averaging 30 feet in depth, but sometimes reaching 130.&quot;

==== Morocco ====

In southern Morocco, the qanat (locally &quot;khettara&quot;) is also used. On the margins of the Sahara Desert, the isolated oases of the Draa River valley and Tafilalt have relied on qanat water for irrigation since the late 14th century. In Marrakech and the Haouz plain, the qanats have been abandoned since the early 1970s, having dried up. In the Tafilaft area, half of the 400 khettaras are still in use. The 1971 Hassan Adahkil Dam&#x27;s build in the main course of the Ziz River and its subsequent impact on local water tables is said to be one of the many reasons for the loss of half of the khettara.

The black berbers (&quot;haratin&quot;) of the south were the hereditary class of qanat diggers in Morocco who build and repair these systems. Their work was hazardous.

==== Tunisia ====
The foggara water management system in Tunisia, used to create oases, is similar to that of the Iranian qanat. The foggara is dug into the foothills of a fairly steep mountain range such as the eastern ranges of the Atlas Mountains. Rainfall in the mountains enters the aquifer and moves toward the Saharan region to the south. The foggara, in length, penetrates the aquifer and collects water. Families maintain the foggara and own the land it irrigates over a ten-meter width, with length reckoned by the size of plot that the available water will irrigate.

=== Asia ===

==== Afghanistan ====
The qanats are called kariz in Dari (Persian) and Pashto and have been in use since the pre-Islamic period. It is estimated that more than 9,370 karizes were in use in the 20th century. The oldest &quot;functional&quot; kariz which is more than 300 years old and 8 kilometers long is located in Wardak province and is still providing water to nearly 3,000 people. 

Many of these ancient structures were destroyed during the Soviet–Aghan War and the War in Afghanistan. Maintenance has not always been possible. The cost of labour has become very high, and maintaining the kariz structures is no longer possible. Lack of skilled artisans who have the traditional knowledge also poses difficulties. A number of the large farmers are abandoning their kariz which has been in their families sometimes for centuries, and moving to tube and dug wells backed by diesel pumps. However, the government of Afghanistan was aware of the importance of these structures and all efforts were made to repair, reconstruct and maintain (through the community) the kariz. The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development along with national and international NGOs made the effort. There were still functional qanat systems in 2009. American forces were reported to have unintentionally destroyed some of the channels during expansion of a military base, creating tensions between them and the local community. Some of these tunnels were used to store supplies, and to move men and equipment underground.
==== Armenia ====
Qanats have been preserved in Armenia in the community of Shvanidzor, in the southern province of Syunik, bordering with Iran. Qanats are named &quot;kahrezes&quot; in Armenian. There are 5 kahrezes in Shvanidzor. Four of them were constructed before the village was founded. The fifth kahrez was constructed in 2005. Potable water runs through three of them, and two are in poor condition. In the summer, especially in July and August, the amount of water reaches its minimum, creating a critical situation in the water supply system. Still, kahrezes are the main source of potable and irrigation water for the community.

==== Azerbaijan ====
The territory of Azerbaijan was home to numerous kahrizes many centuries ago. Archaeological findings suggest that long before the 9th century CE, kahrizes by which the inhabitants brought potable and irrigation water to their settlements were in use in Azerbaijan. Traditionally, kahrizes were built and maintained by a group of masons called &#x27;Kankans&#x27; with manual labour. The profession was handed down from father to son.

It is estimated that until the 20th century, nearly 1,500 kahrizes, of which as many as 400 were in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, existed in Azerbaijan. However, following the introduction of electric and fuel-pumped wells during Soviet times, kahrizes were neglected. Today, it is estimated that 800 are still functioning in Azerbaijan. These operational kahrizes are key to the life of many communities.

In 1999, upon the request of the communities in Nakhichevan, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) began implementing a pilot programme to rehabilitate the kahrizes. By 2018 IOM rehabilitated more than 163 kahrizes with funds from the United Nations Development Programme, European Commission, Canadian International Development Agency, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, US State Department, and the self-contribution of the local communities.

In 2010, IOM began a kahriz rehabilitation project with funds from the Korea International Cooperation Agency. During the First Phase of the action which lasted until January 2013, a total of 20 kahrizes in the mainland of Azerbaijan have been renovated. 

==== China ====
The oasis of Turpan, in the deserts of Xinjiang in northwestern China, uses water provided by qanat (locally called &quot;karez&quot;). There are nearly 1,000 karez systems in the area, and the total length of the canals is about 5,000 kilometers.

Turpan has long been the center of a fertile oasis and an important trade center along the Northern Silk Road, at which time it was adjacent to the kingdoms of Korla and Karashahr to the southwest. The historical record of the karez extends back to the Han dynasty. The Turfan Water Museum is a Protected Area of the People&#x27;s Republic of China because of the importance of the Turpan karez water system to the history of the area.

==== Iran ====

In the middle of the 20th century, an estimated 50,000 &quot;qanats&quot; were in use in Iran, each commissioned and maintained by local users. Of these, only 37,000 remain in use as of 2015. One of the oldest and largest known qanats is in the Iranian city of Gonabad, and after 2,700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers. Yazd, Khorasan and Kerman are zones known for their dependence on an extensive system of &quot;qanats&quot;.

In 2016, UNESCO inscribed the Persian Qanat as a World Heritage Site, listing the following eleven qanats: Qasebeh Qanat, Qanat of Baladeh, Qanat of Zarch, Hasan Abad-e Moshir Qanat, Ebrāhim Ābād Qanat in Markazi Province, Qanat of Vazvān in Esfahan Province, Mozd Ābād Qanat in Esfahan Province, Qanat of the Moon in Esfahan Province, Qanat of Gowhar-riz in Kerman Province, Jupār – Ghāsem Ābād Qanat in Kerman Province, and Akbar Ābād Qanat in Kerman Province. Since 2002, UNESCO&#x27;s International Hydrological Programme Intergovernmental Council began investigating the possibility of an international qanat research center to be located in Yazd, Iran.

The Qanats of Gonabad, also called kariz Kai Khosrow, is one of the oldest and largest qanats in the world built between 700 BCE to 500 BCE. It is located at Gonabad, Razavi Khorasan Province. This property contains 427 water wells with total length of .


According to Callisthenes, the Persians were using water clocks in 328 BCE to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Qanats of Gonabad and kariz Zibad, dates back to 500 BCE. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the &quot;Nowruz&quot;, &quot;Chelah&quot;, or &quot;Yaldā&quot; – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years.
The water clock, or &quot;Fenjaan&quot;, was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from the Qanats of Gonabad until it was replaced by more accurate current clocks. 

Many of the Iranian qanats bear some characteristics which allow us to call them feat of engineering, considering the intricate techniques used in their construction. The eastern and central regions of Iran hold the most qanats due to low precipitation and lack of permanent surface streams, whereas a small number of qanats can be found in the northern and western parts which receive more rainfall and enjoy some permanent rivers. Respectively the provinces Khorasan Razavi, Southern Khorasan, Isfahan, and Yazd accommodate the most qanats, but from the viewpoint of water discharge the provinces Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi, Fars and Kerman are ranked first to fourth.

Henri Golbot explored the genesis of the qanat in his 1979 publication, (The Qanats. A Technique for Obtaining Water), He argues that the ancient Iranians made use of the water that the miners wished to get rid of it, and founded a basic system named qanat or kariz to supply the required water to their farm lands. According to Golbot, this innovation took place in the northwest of the present Iran somewhere bordering Turkey and later was introduced to the neighboring Zagros Mountains.

According to an inscription left by Sargon II, the king of Assyria, in 714 BCE he invaded the city of Uhlu lying in the northwest of Uroomiye lake that lay in the territory of Urartu empire, and then he noticed that the occupied area enjoyed a very rich vegetation even though there was no river running across it. So he managed to discover the reason why the area could stay green and realized that there were some qanats behind the matter. In fact it was Ursa, the king of the region, who had rescued the people from thirst and turned Uhlu into a prosperous and green land. Golbot believes that the influence of the Medeans and Achaemenids made the technology of qanat spread from Urartu, in the western north of Iran and near the present border between Iran and Turkey, to all over the Iranian plateau.

It was an Achaemenid ruling that in case someone succeeded in constructing a qanat and bringing groundwater to the surface in order to cultivate land, or in renovating an abandoned qanat, the tax he was supposed to pay the government would be waived not only for him but also for his successors for up to 5 generations. During this period, the technology of qanat was in its heyday and it even spread to other countries. For example, following Darius&#x27;s order, Silaks the naval commander of the Persian army and Khenombiz the royal architect managed to construct a qanat in the oasis of Kharagha in Egypt. 

Beadnell believes that qanat construction dates back to two distinct periods: they were first constructed by the Persians, and later the Romans dug some other qanats during their reign in Egypt from 30 BCE to 395 CE. The magnificent temple built in this area during Darius&#x27;s reign shows that there was a considerable population depending on the water of qanats. Ragerz has estimated this population to be 10,000 people. The most reliable document confirming the existence of qanats at this time was written by Polybius who states that: &quot;the streams are running down from everywhere at the base of Alborz mountain, and people have transferred too much water from a long distance through some subterranean canals by spending much cost and labor.&quot;

During the Seleucid era, which began after the occupation of Iran by Alexander the Great, it seems that the qanats were abandoned. In terms of the situation of qanats during this era, some historical records have been found. In a study by Russian orientalist scholars it has been mentioned that: the Persians used the side branches of rivers, mountain springs, wells and qanats to supply water. The subterranean galleries excavated to obtain groundwater were named as qanat. These galleries were linked to the surface through some vertical shafts which were sunk in order to get access to the gallery to repair it if necessary.

According to the historical records, the Parthian kings did not care about the qanats the way the Achaemenid kings and even Sassanid kings did. As an instance, Arsac III, one of the Parthian kings, destroyed some qanats in order to make it difficult for Seleucid Antiochus to advance further while fighting him. The historical records from this time indicate a perfect regulation on both water distribution and farmlands. All the water rights were recorded in a special document which was referred to in case of any transaction. The lists of farmlands – whether private or governmental – were kept at the tax department. During this period there were some official rulings on qanats, streams, construction of dam, operation and maintenance of qanats, etc. 

The government proceeded to repair or dredge the qanats that were abandoned or destroyed, and to construct the new qanats if necessary. A document written in the Pahlavi language points out the important role of qanats in developing the cities at that time. In Iran, the advent of Islam, which coincided with the overthrow of the Sassanid dynasty, brought about a profound change in religious, political, social and cultural structures. But the qanats stayed intact because the economic infrastructure including qanats was of great importance to the Arabs. As an instance, M. Lombard reports that the Moslem clerics who lived during Abbasid period, such as Abooyoosef Ya&#x27;qoob (died 798 CE) stipulated that whoever can bring water to the idle lands in order to cultivate, his tax would be waived and he would be entitled to the lands cultivated. Therefore, this policy did not differ from that of the Achaemenids in not getting any tax from the people who revived abandoned lands. 

The Arabs&#x27; supportive policy on qanats was so successful that even Mecca gained a qanat. The Persian historian Hamdollah Mostowfi writes: &quot;Zobeyde Khatoon (Haroon al-Rashid&#x27;s wife) constructed a qanat in Mecca. After the time of Haroon al-Rashid, during the caliph Moghtader&#x27;s reign this qanat fell into decay, but he rehabilitated it, and the qanat was rehabilitated again after it collapsed during the reign of two other caliphs named Ghaem and Naser. After the era of the caliphs this qanat completely fell into ruin because the desert sand filled it up, but later Amir Choopan repaired the qanat and made it flow again in Mecca.&quot;

There are also other historical texts proving that the Abbasids were concerned about qanats. For example, according to the &quot;Incidents of Abdollah bin Tahir&#x27;s Time&quot; written by Gardizi, in 830 CE a terrible earthquake struck the town of Forghaneh and reduced many homes to rubble. The inhabitants of Neyshaboor used to come to Abdollah bin Tahir in order to request him to intervene, for they fought over their qanats and found the relevant instruction or law on qanat as a solution neither in the prophet&#x27;s quotations nor in the clerics&#x27; writings. So Abdollah bin Tahir managed to bring together all the clergymen from throughout Khorasan and Iraq to compile a book entitled &quot;Alghani&quot; (The Book of Qanat). This book collected all the rulings on qanats which could be of use to whoever wanted to judge a dispute over this issue. Gardizi added that this book was still applicable to his time, and everyone made references to this book. One can deduce from these facts that during the above-mentioned period the number of qanats was so considerable that the authorities were prompted to put together some legal instructions concerning them. Also it shows that from the 9th to 11th centuries the qanats that were the hub of the agricultural systems were also of interest to the government. 

Apart from &quot;The Book of Alghani&quot;, which is considered as a law booklet focusing on qanat-related rulings based on Islamic principles, there is another book about groundwater written by Karaji in 1010. This book, entitled &quot;Extraction of Hidden Waters&quot;, examines just the technical issues associated with the qanat and tries to answer the common questions such as how to construct and repair a qanat, how to find a groundwater supply, how to do leveling, etc.. Some of the innovations described in this book were introduced for the first time in the history of hydrogeology, and some of its technical methods are still valid and can be applied in qanat construction. The content of the book implies that its writer (Karaji) did not have any idea that there was another book on qanats compiled by the clergymen.

There are some records dating back to that time, signifying their concern about the legal vicinity of qanats. For example, Mohammad bin Hasan quotes Aboo-Hanifeh that in case someone constructs a qanat in abandoned land, someone else can dig another qanat in the same land on the condition that the second qanat is 500 zera&#x27; (375 meters) away from the first one.

Ms. Lambton quotes Moeen al-din Esfarzi who wrote the book &quot;Rowzat al-Jannat&quot; (the garden of paradise) that Abdollah bin Tahir (from the Taherian dynasty) and Ismaeel Ahmed Samani (from the Samani dynasty) had several qanats constructed in Neyshaboor. Later, in the 11th century, a writer named Nasir Khosrow acknowledged all those qanats with the following words: &quot;Neyshaboor is located in a vast plain at a distance of 40 Farsang (≈240 km) from Serakhs and 70 Farsang (≈420 km) from Mary (Marv) ... all the qanats of this city run underground, and it is said that an Arab who was offended by the people of Neyshaboor has complained that; what a beautiful city Neyshaboor could have become if its qanats would have flowed on the ground surface and instead its people would have been underground.&quot; These documents all certify the importance of qanats during the Islamic history within the cultural territories of Iran.
In the 13th century, the invasion of Iran by Mongolian tribes reduced many qanats and irrigation systems to ruin, and many qanats were deserted and dried up. Later, in the era of the Ilkhanid dynasty especially at the time of Ghazan Khan and his Persian minister Rashid al-Din Fazl-Allah, some measures were taken to revive the qanats and irrigation systems. There is a 14th-century book entitled &quot;Al-Vaghfiya Al-Rashidiya&quot; (Rashid&#x27;s Deeds of Endowment) that names all the properties located in Yazd, Shiraz, Maraghe, Tabriz, Isfahan and Mowsel that Rashid Fazl-Allah donated to the public or religious places. This book mentions many qanats running at that time and irrigating a considerable area of farmland.

At the same time, another book, entitled &quot;Jame&#x27; al-Kheyrat&quot;, was written by Seyyed Rokn al-Din on the same subject as Rashid&#x27;s book. In this book, Seyyed Rokn al-Din names the properties he donated in the region of Yazd. These deeds of endowment indicate that much attention was given to the qanats during the reign of Ilkhanids, but it is attributable to their Persian ministers, who influenced them.

In 1984–1985 the ministry of energy took a census of 28,038 qanats whose total discharge was 9 billion cubic meters. In the years 1992–1993 the census of 28,054 qanats showed a total discharge of 10 billion cubic meters. 10 years later in 2002–2003 the number of the qanats was reported as 33,691 with a total discharge of 8 billion cubic meters.

In the restricted regions there are 317,225 wells, qanats and springs that discharge 36,719 million cubic meters water per year, out of which 3,409 million cubic meters is surplus to the aquifer capacity. in 2005, in the country as a whole, there were 130,008 deep wells with a discharge of 31,403 million cubic meters, 33,8041 semi deep wells with a discharge of 13,491 million cubic meters, 34,355 qanats with a discharge of 8,212 million cubic meters, and 55,912 natural springs with a discharge of 21,240 million cubic meters.

In 2021, a British-trained architect Margot Krasojević designed a luxury eco hotel based on principles of qanat and windcatchers in a desert in Iran, called Qanat. The project has not yet been built but offers ideas for applying ancient technology to modern-day cooling problems in the desert.

==== Iraq ====
A survey of qanat systems in the Kurdistan region of Iraq conducted by the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State University (US) on behalf of UNESCO in 2009 found that out of 683 karez systems, some 380 were still active in 2004, but only 116 were active by 2009. Reasons for the decline of qanats include &quot;abandonment and neglect&quot; prior to 2004, &quot;excessive pumping from wells&quot; and, since 2005, drought. Water shortages are said to have forced, since 2005, over 100,000 people who depended for their livelihoods on karez systems to leave their homes. 

The study says that a single karez has the potential to provide enough household water for nearly 9,000 individuals and irrigate over 200 hectares of farmland. UNESCO and the government of Iraq plan to rehabilitate the karez through a Karez Initiative for Community Revitalization launched in 2010. Most of the karez are in Sulaymaniyah Governorate (84%). A large number are also found in Erbil Governorate (13%), especially on the broad plain around and in Erbil city.

==== India ====
In India, there are karez systems are located at Bidar, Bijapur, Burhanpur &quot;(Kundi Bhandara)&quot;, and Aurgangabad. The Bidar karez systems were probably the first dug in India. It dates to the Bahmani period. Bidar has three karez systems as per Ghulam Yazdani&#x27;s documentation. Other than Naubad there are two more karez systems in Bidar, &quot;Shukla Theerth&quot; and &quot;Jamna Mori&quot;. The Shukla theerth is the longest karez system in Bidar. The mother well of this karez has been discovered by near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. The third system called Jamna mori is more of a distribution system within the old city area with many channels crisscrossing the city lanes. Restoration efforts commenced in 2014, with the desilting and excavation of the Naubad Karez in 2015, uncovering 27 vertical shafts linked to the Karez. The rejuvenation of the system has had a significant impact on the water-deficit city of Bidar. A seventh line of the system was discovered in 2016 during a sewage line excavation.

Valliyil Govindankutty, assistant professor in geography at Government College, Chittur, was responsible for rediscovery and mapping of the Naubad Karez System in 2012-2013. Later in 2014-2016 team YUVAA joined Govindankutty to help uncover Other two Karez Systems in Bidar. Detailed documentation of the Naubad karez system was done in August 2013 and a report was submitted to District Administration of Bidar that found several new facts. The research has led to the initiation of cleaning the debris and collapsed sections paving the way to its rejuvenation. The cleaning of karez has led to bringing water to higher areas of the plateau, and it has in turn recharged the wells in the vicinity.

The Bijapur karez system is much more complicated. A reveals that it has surface water and groundwater connections. The Bijapur karez is a network of shallow masonry aqueducts, terracotta/ceramic pipes, embankments and reservoirs, tanks etc. All weave together a network to ensure water reaches the old city. The system starts at Torwi and extends as shallow aqueducts and further as pipes; further it becomes deeper from the Sainik school area onward which exists as a tunnel dug through the geology. The system can be clearly traced up to Ibrahim Roja.

In Aurangabad the karez systems are called nahars. These are shallow aqueducts running through the city. There are 14 aqueducts in Aurangabad. The Nahar-i-Ambari is the oldest and longest. Its again a combination of shallow aqueducts, open channels, pipes, cisterns, etc. The source of water is a surface water body. The karez has been constructed right below the bed of lake. The lake water seeps through the soil into the Karez Gallery.

In Burhanpur the karez is called &quot;Kundi-Bhandara&quot;, sometimes wrongly referred to as&quot;Khuni Bhandara&quot;. The system is approx 6 km long starts from the alluvial fans of Satpura hills in the north of the town. Unlike Bidar, Bijapur and Aurgangabad the System airvents are round in shape. Inside the Karez one could see lime depositions on the walls. The Systems ends to carry water further to palaces and public fountains through pipe line.

==== Indonesia ====
It has been suggested that underground temples at Gua Made in Java reached by shafts, in which masks of a green metal were found, originated as a qanat.

==== Japan ====
In Japan there are several dozen qanat-like structures, locally known as &#x27;mambo&#x27; or &#x27;manbo&#x27;, most notably in the Mie and Gifu Prefectures. Whereas some link their origin clearly to the Chinese karez, and therefore to the Iranian source, a Japanese conference in 2008 found insufficient scientific studies to evaluate the origins of the mambo.

==== Jordan ====
Among the qanats built in the Roman Empire, the long Gadara Aqueduct in northern Jordan was possibly the longest continuous qanat ever built. Partly following the course of an older Hellenistic aqueduct, excavation work arguably started after a visit by emperor Hadrian in 129–130 CE. The Gadara Aqueduct was never totally finished and was put in service only in sections.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan qanat irrigation system is endemic only in Balochistan. The major concentration is in the north and northwest along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and oasis of Makoran division. The karez system of the Balochistan desert is on the tentative list for future world heritage sites in Pakistan.

The acute shortage of water resources give water a decisive role in the regional conflicts arose in the course of history of Balochistan. Therefore, in Balochistan, the possession of water resources is more important than ownership of land. Hence afterward a complex system for the collection, channeling and distribution of water was developed in Balochistan. Similarly, the distribution and unbiased flow of water to different stockholders also necessitate the importance of different societal classes in Balochistan in general and particularly in Makoran. 

For instance, sarrishta, literally, head of the chain, is responsible for administration of channel. He normally owns the largest water quota. Under sarrishta, there are several heads of owners issadar who also possessed larger water quotas. The social hierarchy within Baloch society of Makoran depends upon the possession of largest quotas of water. The role of sarrishta in some cases hierarchical and passing from generations within the family and he must have the knowledge of the criteria of unbiased distribution of water among different issadar.

The sharing of water is based on a complex indigenous system of measurement depends upon time and space particularly to the phases of moon; the hangams. Based on seasonal variations and share of water the hangams are apportioned among various owners over period of seven or fourteen days. However, in some places, instead of hangam, anna used which is based on twelve-hour period for each quota. Therefore, if a person own 16 quotas it means that he is entitled for water for eight days in high seasons and 16 days in winter when water level went down as well as expectation of winter rain (Baharga) in Makran region. The twelve-hour water quota again subdivided into several sub-fractions of local measuring scales such as tas or pad (Dr Gul Hasan Pro VC LUAWMS, 2 day National conference on Kech).

The Chagai district is in the north west corner of Balochistan, Pakistan, bordering with Afghanistan and Iran. Qanats, locally known as Kahn, are found more broadly in this region. They are spread from Chaghai district all the way up to Zhob district.

==== Syria ====
Qanats were found over much of Syria. The widespread installation of groundwater pumps has lowered the water table and qanat system. Qanats have gone dry and been abandoned across the country.

==== Oman ====
In Oman from the Iron Age period (found in Salut, Bat and other sites) a system of underground aqueducts called &#x27;Falaj&#x27; were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping horizontal tunnels. There are three types of Falaj: Daudi () with underground aqueducts, Ghaili () requiring a dam to collect the water, and Aini () whose source is a water spring. These enabled large scale agriculture to flourish in a dryland environment. According to UNESCO, some 3,000 &quot;aflaj&quot; (plural) or &quot;falaj&quot; (singular), are still in use in Oman today. Nizwa, the former capital city of Oman, was built around a &quot;falaj&quot; which is in use to this day. These systems date to before the Iron Age in Oman. In July 2006, five representative examples of this irrigation system were inscribed as a World Heritage Site.

==== United Arab Emirates ====
The oases of the city of Al Ain (particularly Al-Ain, Al-Qattarah, Al-Mu&#x27;taredh, Al-Jimi, Al-Muwaiji, and Hili), adjacent to Al-Buraimi in Oman, continue traditional &quot;falaj&quot; (qanat) irrigations for the palm groves and gardens, and form part of the city&#x27;s ancient heritage. Multiple &quot;aflaj&quot; have been found from the early Iron Age, as early as 1100 BC, and some sources claim these to be the earliest examples of the qanat irrigation system.

The falaj system continued to be in use into the early Pre Islamic (300 BC - 300 AD) and were reintroduced after the early Islamic conquests in the souqs of Julfar, Dibba, and Tawwam. Islamic geographer Al Muqqadasi stated&quot;: &quot;Hafit {Tuwwam} abounds in palm trees&quot;&quot; in the 10th century, indicating extensive use of the falaj system. The falaj system is still operating in the city of Al Ain, as well as in multiple mountainous settlements, including the villages of Wadi Shees and Masafi.

=== Europe ===
==== Greece ====
The Tunnel of Eupalinos on Samos runs for 1 kilometre through a hill to supply water to Pythagorion. It was built on the order of Polycrates around 550 BCE. At either end of the tunnel proper, shallow &quot;qanat&quot;-like tunnels carried the water from the spring and to the town.

==== Italy ====
The long Tunnels of Claudius, intended to partially drain the largest Italian inland water, Fucine Lake, was constructed using the qanat technique. It featured shafts up to 122 m deep. The entire ancient town of Palermo in Sicily was equipped with a huge qanat system built during the Arab period (827–1072). Many of the qanats are now mapped and some can be visited. The famous Scirocco room has an air-conditioning system cooled by the flow of water in a qanat and a &quot;wind tower&quot;, a structure able to catch the wind and use it to draw the cooled air up into the room.

==== Luxembourg ====
The Raschpëtzer near Helmsange in southern Luxembourg is a particularly well preserved example of a Roman qanat. It is probably the most extensive system of its kind north of the Alps. To date, some 330 m of the total tunnel length of 600 m have been explored. Thirteen of the 20 to 25 shafts have been investigated. The qanat appears to have provided water for a large Roman villa on the slopes of the Alzette valley. It was built during the Gallo-Roman period, probably around the year 150 and functioned for about 120 years thereafter.

==== Spain ====
There are still many examples of or qanat systems in Spain, most likely brought to the area by the Moors during their rule of the Iberian peninsula. Turrillas in Andalusia on the north facing slopes of the Sierra de Alhamilla has evidence of a qanat system. Granada is another site with an extensive qanat system. In Madrid they were called and were used until the construction of the Canal de Isabel II. See and in Spanish.

=== The Americas ===

Qanats in the Americas, usually referred to as puquios or filtration galleries, can be found in the Nazca Province of Peru and in northern Chile. The origin and dating of the Nazca puquios is disputed, although some archaeologists have asserted that they were constructed by the indigenous people of the Nazca culture beginning about 500 CE.
The Spanish introduced qanats into Mexico in 1520 CE.

In the Atacama Desert of northern Chile the shafts of puquios are known as &quot;socavones&quot;. &quot;Socavones&quot; are known to exist in Azapa Valley and the oasis of Sibaya, Pica-Matilla, and Puquio de Núñez. In 1918 geologist Juan Brüggen mentioned the existence of 23 &quot;socavones&quot; in the Pica oasis, yet these have since then been abandoned due to economic and social changes.

== Symbolism in Iranian culture ==

In an August 21, 1906, letter written from Tehran, Florence Khanum, the American wife of Persian diplomat Ali Kuli Khan, described the use of qanats for the garden at the home of her brother-in-law, General Husayn Kalantar,
January 1, 1913

 An old tradition in Iran was to hold symbolic wedding ceremonies between widows and qanats in which the widow became the &quot;wife&quot; of the qanat. This was believed to help ensure the continued flow of water.

<text>In statistical inference, specifically predictive inference, a prediction interval is an estimate of an interval in which a future observation will fall, with a certain probability, given what has already been observed. Prediction intervals are often used in regression analysis.

A simple example is given by a six-sided die with face values ranging from 1 to 6. The confidence interval for the estimated expected value of the face value will be around 3.5 and will become narrower with a larger sample size. However, the prediction interval for the next roll will approximately range from 1 to 6, even with any number of samples seen so far.

Prediction intervals are used in both frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics: a prediction interval bears the same relationship to a future observation that a frequentist confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval bears to an unobservable population parameter: prediction intervals predict the distribution of individual future points, whereas confidence intervals and credible intervals of parameters predict the distribution of estimates of the true population mean or other quantity of interest that cannot be observed.

== Introduction ==
If one makes the parametric assumption that the underlying distribution is a normal distribution, and has a sample set {&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;}, then confidence intervals and credible intervals may be used to estimate the population mean &quot;μ&quot; and population standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; of the underlying population, while prediction intervals may be used to estimate the value of the next sample variable, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1.

Alternatively, in Bayesian terms, a prediction interval can be described as a credible interval for the variable itself, rather than for a parameter of the distribution thereof.

The concept of prediction intervals need not be restricted to inference about a single future sample value but can be extended to more complicated cases. For example, in the context of river flooding where analyses are often based on annual values of the largest flow within the year, there may be interest in making inferences about the largest flood likely to be experienced within the next 50 years.

Since prediction intervals are only concerned with past and future observations, rather than unobservable population parameters, they are advocated as a better method than confidence intervals by some statisticians, such as Seymour Geisser, following the focus on observables by Bruno de Finetti.

== Normal distribution ==
Given a sample from a normal distribution, whose parameters are unknown, it is possible to give prediction intervals in the frequentist sense, i.e., an interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] based on statistics of the sample such that on repeated experiments, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 falls in the interval the desired percentage of the time; one may call these &quot;predictive confidence intervals&quot;.

A general technique of frequentist prediction intervals is to find and compute a pivotal quantity of the observables &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 – meaning a function of observables and parameters whose probability distribution does not depend on the parameters – that can be inverted to give a probability of the future observation &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 falling in some interval computed in terms of the observed values so far, formula_1 Such a pivotal quantity, depending only on observables, is called an ancillary statistic. The usual method of constructing pivotal quantities is to take the difference of two variables that depend on location, so that location cancels out, and then take the ratio of two variables that depend on scale, so that scale cancels out.
The most familiar pivotal quantity is the Student&#x27;s t-statistic, which can be derived by this method and is used in the sequel.

=== Known mean, known variance ===
A prediction interval [&quot;ℓ&quot;,&quot;u&quot;] for a future observation &quot;X&quot; in a normal distribution &quot;N&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;2) with known mean and variance may be calculated from

:formula_2, the standard score of &quot;X&quot;, is distributed as standard normal.

Hence

:formula_3

or

:formula_4

with &quot;z&quot; the quantile in the standard normal distribution for which:

:formula_5
or equivalently;

:formula_6


The prediction interval is conventionally written as:
:formula_7

For example, to calculate the 95% prediction interval for a normal distribution with a mean (&quot;μ&quot;) of 5 and a standard deviation (&quot;σ&quot;) of 1, then &quot;z&quot; is approximately 2. Therefore, the lower limit of the prediction interval is approximately 5 ‒ (2⋅1) = 3, and the upper limit is approximately 5 + (2⋅1) = 7, thus giving a prediction interval of approximately 3 to 7.

=== Estimation of parameters ===
For a distribution with unknown parameters, a direct approach to prediction is to estimate the parameters and then use the associated quantile function – for example, one could use the sample mean formula_8 as estimate for &quot;μ&quot; and the sample variance &quot;s&quot;2 as an estimate for &quot;σ&quot;2. There are two natural choices for &quot;s&quot;2 here – dividing by formula_9 yields an unbiased estimate, while dividing by &quot;n&quot; yields the maximum likelihood estimator, and either might be used. One then uses the quantile function with these estimated parameters formula_10 to give a prediction interval.

This approach is usable, but the resulting interval will not have the repeated sampling interpretation – it is not a predictive confidence interval.

For the sequel, use the sample mean:
:formula_11
and the (unbiased) sample variance:
:formula_12

==== Unknown mean, known variance ====
Given a normal distribution with unknown mean &quot;μ&quot; but known variance formula_13, the sample mean formula_8 of the observations formula_15 has distribution formula_16 while the future observation formula_17 has distribution formula_18 Taking the difference of these cancels the &quot;μ&quot; and yields a normal distribution of variance formula_19 thus
:formula_20
Solving for formula_17 gives the prediction distribution formula_22 from which one can compute intervals as before. This is a predictive confidence interval in the sense that if one uses a quantile range of 100&quot;p&quot;%, then on repeated applications of this computation, the future observation formula_17 will fall in the predicted interval 100&quot;p&quot;% of the time.

Notice that this prediction distribution is more conservative than using the estimated mean formula_8 and known variance formula_13, as this uses compound variance formula_26, hence yields slightly wider intervals. This is necessary for the desired confidence interval property to hold.

==== Known mean, unknown variance ====
Conversely, given a normal distribution with known mean &quot;μ&quot; but unknown variance formula_13, 
the sample variance formula_28 of the observations formula_15 has, up to scale, a formula_30 distribution; more precisely:
:formula_31
On the other hand, the future observation formula_17 has distribution formula_18
Taking the ratio of the future observation residual formula_34 and the sample standard deviation &quot;s&quot; cancels the &quot;σ,&quot; yielding a Student&#x27;s t-distribution with &quot;n&quot; – 1 degrees of freedom (see its derivation):

: formula_35

Solving for formula_17 gives the prediction distribution formula_37 from which one can compute intervals as before.

Notice that this prediction distribution is more conservative than using a normal distribution with the estimated standard deviation formula_38 and known mean &quot;μ&quot;, as it uses the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution, hence yields wider intervals. This is necessary for the desired confidence interval property to hold.

==== Unknown mean, unknown variance ====
Combining the above for a normal distribution formula_39 with both &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;2 unknown yields the following ancillary statistic:
:formula_40
This simple combination is possible because the sample mean and sample variance of the normal distribution are independent statistics; this is only true for the normal distribution, and in fact characterizes the normal distribution.

Solving for formula_17 yields the prediction distribution 
:formula_42

The probability of formula_17 falling in a given interval is then:
:formula_44

where &quot;Tn,a&quot; is the 100((1 − &quot;p&quot;)/2)th percentile of Student&#x27;s t-distribution with &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom. Therefore, the numbers

:formula_45

are the endpoints of a 100(1 − &quot;p&quot;)% prediction interval for formula_17.

== Non-parametric methods ==
One can compute prediction intervals without any assumptions on the population, i.e. in a non-parametric way.

The residual bootstrap method can be used for constructing non-parametric prediction intervals.

=== Conformal Prediction ===

In general the conformal prediction method is more general.
Let us look at the special case of using the minimum and maximum as boundaries for a prediction interval:
If one has a sample of identical random variables {&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;}, then the probability that the next observation &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 will be the largest is 1/(&quot;n&quot; + 1), since all observations have equal probability of being the maximum. In the same way, the probability that &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 will be the smallest is 1/(&quot;n&quot; + 1). The other (&quot;n&quot; − 1)/(&quot;n&quot; + 1) of the time, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 falls between the sample maximum and sample minimum of the sample {&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;}. Thus, denoting the sample maximum and minimum by &quot;M&quot; and &quot;m,&quot; this yields an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)/(&quot;n&quot; + 1) prediction interval of [&quot;m&quot;, &quot;M&quot;].

Notice that while this gives the probability that a future observation will fall in a range, it does not give any estimate as to where in a segment it will fall – notably, if it falls outside the range of observed values, it may be far outside the range. See extreme value theory for further discussion. Formally, this applies not just to sampling from a population, but to any exchangeable sequence of random variables, not necessarily independent or identically distributed.

== Contrast with other intervals ==

=== Contrast with confidence intervals ===

In the formula for the predictive confidence interval &quot;no mention&quot; is made of the unobservable parameters &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;σ&quot; of population mean and standard deviation – the observed &quot;sample&quot; statistics formula_47 and formula_48 of sample mean and standard deviation are used, and what is estimated is the outcome of &quot;future&quot; samples.

When considering prediction intervals, rather than using sample statistics as estimators of population parameters and applying confidence intervals to these estimates, one considers &quot;the next sample&quot; formula_17 as &quot;itself&quot; a statistic, and computes its sampling distribution.

In parameter confidence intervals, one estimates population parameters; if one wishes to interpret this as prediction of the next sample, one models &quot;the next sample&quot; as a draw from this estimated population, using the (estimated) &quot;population&quot; distribution. By contrast, in predictive confidence intervals, one uses the &quot;sampling&quot; distribution of (a statistic of) a sample of &quot;n&quot; or &quot;n&quot; + 1 observations from such a population, and the population distribution is not directly used, though the assumption about its form (though not the values of its parameters) is used in computing the sampling distribution.

== In regression analysis ==
A common application of prediction intervals is to regression analysis.
Suppose the data is being modeled by a straight line (simple linear regression):
:formula_50
where formula_51 is the response variable, formula_52 is the explanatory variable, &quot;εi&quot; is a random error term, and formula_53 and formula_54 are parameters.

Given estimates formula_55 and formula_56 for the parameters, such as from a ordinary least squares, the predicted response value &quot;y&quot;&quot;d&quot; for a given explanatory value &quot;x&quot;&quot;d&quot; is

:formula_57

(the point on the regression line), while the actual response would be

:formula_58

The point estimate formula_59 is called the &quot;mean response&quot;, and is an estimate of the expected value of &quot;y&quot;&quot;d&quot;, formula_60

A prediction interval instead gives an interval in which one expects &quot;y&quot;&quot;d&quot; to fall; this is not necessary if the actual parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are known (together with the error term &quot;εi&quot;), but if one is estimating from a sample, then one may use the standard error of the estimates for the intercept and slope (formula_61 and formula_62), as well as their correlation, to compute a prediction interval.

In regression, makes a distinction between intervals for predictions of the mean response vs. for predictions of observed response—affecting essentially the inclusion or not of the unity term within the square root in the expansion factors above; for details, see .

== Bayesian statistics ==

Seymour Geisser, a proponent of predictive inference, gives predictive applications of Bayesian statistics.

In Bayesian statistics, one can compute (Bayesian) prediction intervals from the posterior probability of the random variable, as a credible interval. In theoretical work, credible intervals are not often calculated for the prediction of future events, but for inference of parameters – i.e., credible intervals of a parameter, not for the outcomes of the variable itself. However, particularly where applications are concerned with possible extreme values of yet to be observed cases, credible intervals for such values can be of practical importance.

==Applications==
Prediction intervals are commonly used as definitions of reference ranges, such as reference ranges for blood tests to give an idea of whether a blood test is normal or not. For this purpose, the most commonly used prediction interval is the 95% prediction interval, and a reference range based on it can be called a &quot;standard reference range&quot;.

<text>In thermochemistry, an exothermic reaction is a &quot;reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ is negative.&quot; Exothermic reactions usually release heat. The term is often confused with exergonic reaction, which IUPAC defines as &quot;... a reaction for which the overall standard Gibbs energy change Δ&quot;G&quot;⚬ is negative.&quot; A strongly exothermic reaction will usually also be exergonic because Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ makes a major contribution to Δ&quot;G&quot;⚬. Most of the spectacular chemical reactions that are demonstrated in classrooms are exothermic and exergonic. The opposite is an endothermic reaction, which usually takes up heat and is driven by an entropy increase in the system. 

==Examples==
Examples are numerous: combustion, the thermite reaction, combining strong acids and bases, polymerizations. As an example in everyday life, hand warmers make use of the oxidation of iron to achieve an exothermic reaction:
:4Fe  + 3O2  → 2Fe2O3  Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ = - 1648 kJ/mol

A particularly important class of exothermic reactions is combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel, e.g. the burning of natural gas: 
:CH4  + 2O2  → CO2  + 2H2O  Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ = - 890 kJ/mol

These sample reactions are strongly exothermic. 

Uncontrolled exothermic reactions, those leading to fires and explosions, are wasteful because it is difficult to capture the released energy. Nature effects combustion reactions under highly controlled conditions, avoiding fires and explosions, in aerobic respiration so as to capture the released energy, e.g. for the formation of ATP.

==Measurement==
The enthalpy of a chemical system is essentially its energy. The enthalpy change Δ&quot;H&quot; for a reaction is equal to the heat &quot;q&quot; transferred out of (or into) a closed system at constant pressure without in- or output of electrical energy. Heat production or absorption in a chemical reaction is measured using calorimetry, e.g. with a bomb calorimeter. One common laboratory instrument is the reaction calorimeter, where the heat flow from or into the reaction vessel is monitored. The heat release and corresponding energy change, Δ, of a combustion reaction can be measured particularly accurately. 

The measured heat energy released in an exothermic reaction is converted to Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ in Joule per mole (formerly cal/mol). The &quot;standard&quot; enthalpy change Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ is essentially the enthalpy change when the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction are considered as the amounts of reactants and products (in mole); usually, the initial and final temperature is assumed to be 25 °C. For gas-phase reactions, Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ values are related to bond energies to a good approximation by:
:Δ⚬ = total bond energy of reactants − total bond energy of products

In an exothermic reaction, by definition, the enthalpy change has a negative value:
:Δ = &quot;H&quot;products - &quot;H&quot;reactants &lt; 0
where a larger value (the higher energy of the reactants) is subtracted from a smaller value (the lower energy of the products). For example, when hydrogen burns:
:2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (g)
:Δ⚬ = −483.6 kJ/mol

<doc id="536064" wikidata="Q7770923" url="?curid=536064" title="The Two Georges">
<text>The Two Georges is an alternate history and detective thriller novel co-written by science fiction author Harry Turtledove and Oscar-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss. It was originally published in 1995 by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the United Kingdom, and in 1996 by Tor Books in the United States, and was nominated for the 1995 Sidewise Award for Alternate History.

==Background==
For more than two centuries, what would have become the continental United States and Canada has been the North American Union, a self-governing dominion within the British Empire with Alaska being retained under the rule of Russia and Hawaii being a British protectorate. The title of the novel refers to a fictional Gainsborough painting that commemorates the agreement between George Washington and King George III, which peacefully ended the American Revolution, implied as the result of George Grenville never becoming Prime Minister. The painting itself has become a symbol of national unity.

Native Americans fared much better than in real-world history with tribes such as the Iroquois and the Cherokee managing to keep much of their land and have autonomy, their status comparable to that of the Princely States in British India.

As the North American Union remained in the British Empire following peaceful negotiation, the French Revolution was suppressed at the storming of the Bastille by troops under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte in the service of Louis XVI, thus preserving the Bourbon monarchy. By the twentieth century, France and Spain exist in a French-dominated personal union, the Holy Alliance, which controls most of Latin America and Northern Africa and is ruled over by François IV.

The abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1833 included slaves in North America. The emancipated blacks prospered, gained education and experienced a rapid upward social mobility, becoming a mainly middle class community by the 20th century. Conversely, the Irish-American community remained a predominantly poor, working class population, subsisting on hard physical labor such as the coal mining on which the North American Union depended for its energy. This created a feeling of bitter jealousy among the Irish, and many of them came to support the Sons of Liberty, a terrorist organization that wants to see America become independent from the British Empire and promotes a blatantly racist and xenophobic ideology.

In the twentieth century, the empires of Great Britain, the Holy Alliance and Russia are the world&#x27;s major powers, with the Austrian Empire being a European land-based middle power coveting Balkan territory and neither Germany nor Italy becoming unified nation-states.

As in the Mexican War of our history, the mid-nineteenth century saw Britain and the North American Union conquer a large portion of Nueva España (in this case, also including the Baja California peninsula) from the Holy Alliance. The city of Los Angeles was renamed New Liverpool and developed into one of the largest cities of the North American Union and the Province of Upper California.

==Plot==
&quot;The Two Georges&quot;, being displayed in New Liverpool, is stolen while a crowd is distracted by the murder of &#x27;Honest&#x27; Dick (a.k.a. &#x27;Tricky&#x27; Dick), the Steamer King, a nationally known used car salesman. In its place is left a gramophone with a recording of the &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; a notorious subversive song serving as the anthem of the Sons of Liberty.

Colonel Thomas Bushell of the Royal American Mounted Police leads the search for the painting, accompanied by its former curator (and his eventual love interest) Dr. Kathleen Flannery and Captain Samuel Stanley. Some days later, a ransom note is received from the Sons of Liberty. The Governor-General of the North American Union, Sir Martin Luther King, informs Bushell in confidence that the painting must be recovered before King-Emperor Charles III&#x27;s state visit, or the government will have to pay the Sons&#x27; ransom demand of fifty million pounds.

The search takes Bushell, Flannery, and Stanley across the country via airship (an advanced form of dirigible), train, and steamer. They also meet many members of the Sons of Liberty, including &quot;Common Sense&quot; editor John F. Kennedy.

After chasing many false leads and the wrong suspects, Bushell and his associates arrive at Victoria (the nation&#x27;s capital, on the south side of the Potomac River across from Georgestown, Maryland); during a reception at the Russian Embassy, Bushell encounters his ex-wife Irene, who had an affair with and subsequently married Sir David Clarke, Governor-General King&#x27;s chief of staff. &quot;The Two Georges&quot; is found undamaged in a self-storage facility an hour before the King arrives. They also uncover the true culprits: the Holy Alliance and Bushell&#x27;s superior officer and covert Sons of Liberty operative, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Bragg, who believed that emancipation was an injustice to his formerly slave-holding family. Bushell then thwarts Bragg&#x27;s attempts to assassinate the King, first by gunfire then by a bomb concealed in the frame of &quot;The Two Georges&quot;. When Bragg is arrested and awaiting trial, he and Bushell argue over the outcomes of a potential war against the Holy Alliance and a resultant American separatist uprising caused by the theft of the painting. Later, Bushell and Stanley are both knighted by King Charles for their accomplishments.

==Reception==
The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; listed &quot;The Two Georges&quot; as one of many pieces of fiction that have pictured blacks as the head of the executive branch, in this case Sir Martin Luther King, Governor General of North America. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praises the novel&#x27;s &quot;recognizable yet delightfully distorted&quot; world where &quot;engaging characters play out a suspenseful and satisfying story&quot;. &quot;School Library Journal&quot; described the novel as &quot;a fast-paced and gripping story.&quot;

==Reviews==
*&quot;Dragon&quot;

==Similar themes in other works==

&quot;Washington&#x27;s Dirigible&quot;, part of John Barnes&#x27; &quot;Timeline Wars&quot; series, has a similar theme: a resourceful time traveler manages to get Benjamin Franklin appointed as the tutor of the young George III – making him a liberal-minded King, well-disposed towards the North American colonists. The result, as in &quot;The Two Georges&quot;, is an alternate history timeline in which the American War of Independence is averted and North America remains part of the British Empire, although with a great deal of autonomy.

<text>Nolina is a genus of tropical xerophytic flowering plants belonging to the Asparagaceae plant family. The native distribution of the genus includes most of Mexico and the southern regions of the United States. Especially in the USA, members of the genus are known as beargrasses, some of which are cultivated as ornamental plants.

&quot;Nolina&quot; species grow large rosettes of many leaves, with many species forming large, erect trunks, with some species branching to contain multiple rosettes of leaves. They are typically large plants, and are dioecious, with male and female flowers being produced on different plants.

The genus is named for 18th century French arboriculturist Abbé C. P. Nolin. 

== Classification ==
In the APG III classification system of plant taxonomy, &quot;Nolina&quot; is a member of the Asparagaceae family of plants, and within this family, &quot;Nolina&quot; is part of a subfamily, the Nolinoideae. In the past, many members of the Nolinoideae, including &quot;Nolina&quot;, were placed in the now defunct Ruscaceae family). Former alternative placements include Nolinaceae and Agavaceae.

Previously, some botanists have included the genus &quot;Beaucarnea&quot; in &quot;Nolina,&quot; and over time, multiple species of both genera have been moved back and forth between the two genera. More recent molecular phylogenetic research found that &quot;Beaucarnea&quot; and &quot;Nolina&quot; are well supported by DNA and morphological evidence as being two distinct genera.

== Description ==
&quot;Nolina&quot; are perennial plants, with some growing as tufts of leaves arising from near ground level with little or only a short above ground stem, whilst others grow in a tree-like manner forming a woody, leafless caudex or trunk of up to about 2-3m, that with age, may branch to form multiple branches. The shorter species, especially those not forming an above ground stem, usually form colonies, often with many rosettes. The leaves are arranged into rosettes of many long, linear leaves, with the leaves being broader where they meet the stem.

The inflorescence consists of a scape (or a bare stem arising from the leaf rosettes) of between 5-250cm length, with panicles of flowers, of 30 to 180cm in length, held along the scape. Each node holds 2-5 functionally unisexual flowers. The tepals are white, cream or light tan. The fruits are capsular, 3-locular, 3-lobed and often inflated.

<doc id="536079" wikidata="Q876798" url="?curid=536079" title="Unconformity">
<text>An unconformity is a buried erosional or non-depositional surface separating two rock masses or strata of different ages, indicating that sediment deposition was not continuous. In general, the older layer was exposed to erosion for an interval of time before deposition of the younger layer, but the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary geologic record. The significance of angular unconformity (see below) was shown by James Hutton, who found examples of Hutton&#x27;s Unconformity at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in Berwickshire in 1788, both in Scotland.

The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath (unless the sequence has been overturned). An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in a region or were subsequently eroded before the next deposition. The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area. The interval of geologic time not represented is called a hiatus. It is a kind of relative dating.

==Types==

===Disconformity===
A disconformity is an unconformity between parallel layers of sedimentary rocks which represents a period of erosion or non-deposition. Disconformities are marked by features of subaerial erosion. This type of erosion can leave channels and paleosols in the rock record.

===Nonconformity===

A nonconformity exists between sedimentary rocks and metamorphic or igneous rocks when the sedimentary rock lies above and was deposited on the pre-existing and eroded metamorphic or igneous rock. Namely, if the rock below the break is igneous or has lost its bedding due to metamorphism, then the plane of juncture is a nonconformity.

===Angular unconformity===

An angular unconformity is an unconformity where horizontally parallel strata of sedimentary rock are deposited on tilted and eroded layers, producing an angular discordance with the overlying horizontal layers. The whole sequence may later be deformed and tilted by further orogenic activity. A typical case history is presented by the Briançonnais realm (Swiss and French Prealps) during the Jurassic.
Angular unconformities can occur in ash fall layers of pyroclastic rock deposited by volcanoes during explosive eruptions. In these cases, the hiatus in deposition represented by the unconformity may be geologically very short – hours, days or weeks.

===Paraconformity===

A paraconformity is a type of unconformity in which the sedimentary layers above and below the unconformity are parallel, but there is no obvious erosional break between them. A break in sedimentation is indicated, for example, by fossil evidence. It is also called nondepositional unconformity or pseudoconformity. Short paraconformities are called diastems.

===Buttress unconformity===
A buttress unconformity, also known as onlap unconformity, occurs when younger bedding is deposited against older strata thus influencing its bedding structure.

===Blended unconformity===
A blended unconformity is a type of disconformity or nonconformity with no distinct separation plane or contact, sometimes consisting of soils, paleosols, or beds of pebbles derived from the underlying rock.

<text>Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test is a statistical test used to test whether the difference between the response of two groups is statistically significant or not. It is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution under the null hypothesis. It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known (typically, the scaling term is unknown and is therefore a nuisance parameter). When the scaling term is estimated based on the data, the test statistic—under certain conditions—follows a Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot; distribution. The &quot;t&quot;-test&#x27;s most common application is to test whether the means of two populations are significantly different. In many cases, a Z-test will yield very similar results to a &quot;t&quot;-test because the latter converges to the former as the size of the dataset increases.

==History==
The term &quot;&quot;t&quot;-statistic&quot; is abbreviated from &quot;hypothesis test statistic&quot;. In statistics, the &quot;t&quot;-distribution was first derived as a posterior distribution in 1876 by Helmert and Lüroth. The &quot;t&quot;-distribution also appeared in a more general form as Pearson type IV distribution in Karl Pearson&#x27;s 1895 paper. However, the &quot;t&quot;-distribution, also known as Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution, gets its name from William Sealy Gosset, who first published it in English in 1908 in the scientific journal Biometrika using the pseudonym &quot;Student&quot; because his employer preferred staff to use pen names when publishing scientific papers. Gosset worked at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland, and was interested in the problems of small samples for example, the chemical properties of barley with small sample sizes. Hence a second version of the etymology of the term Student is that Guinness did not want their competitors to know that they were using the &quot;t&quot;-test to determine the quality of raw material. Although it was William Gosset after whom the term &quot;Student&quot; is penned, it was actually through the work of Ronald Fisher that the distribution became well known as &quot;Student&#x27;s distribution&quot; and &quot;Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test&quot;.

Gosset devised the &quot;t&quot;-test as an economical way to monitor the quality of stout. The &quot;t&quot;-test work was submitted to and accepted in the journal &quot;Biometrika&quot; and published in 1908.

Guinness had a policy of allowing technical staff leave for study (so-called &quot;study leave&quot;), which Gosset used during the first two terms of the 1906–1907 academic year in Professor Karl Pearson&#x27;s Biometric Laboratory at University College London. Gosset&#x27;s identity was then known to fellow statisticians and to editor-in-chief Karl Pearson.
==Uses==

===One-sample &quot;t&quot;-test===
A one-sample Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test is a location test of whether the mean of a population has a value specified in a null hypothesis. In testing the null hypothesis that the population mean is equal to a specified value , one uses the statistic

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the sample mean, is the sample standard deviation and is the sample size. The degrees of freedom used in this test are . Although the parent population does not need to be normally distributed, the distribution of the population of sample means formula_2 is assumed to be normal.

By the central limit theorem, if the observations are independent and the second moment exists, then formula_4 will be approximately normal formula_5.

===Two-sample &quot;t&quot;-tests===


A two-sample location test of the null hypothesis such that the means of two populations are equal. All such tests are usually called Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-tests, though strictly speaking that name should only be used if the variances of the two populations are also assumed to be equal; the form of the test used when this assumption is dropped is sometimes called Welch&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test. These tests are often referred to as unpaired or &quot;independent samples&quot; &quot;t&quot;-tests, as they are typically applied when the statistical units underlying the two samples being compared are non-overlapping.

Two-sample &quot;t&quot;-tests for a difference in means involve independent samples (unpaired samples) or paired samples. Paired &quot;t&quot;-tests are a form of blocking, and have greater power (probability of avoiding a type II error, also known as a false negative) than unpaired tests when the paired units are similar with respect to &quot;noise factors&quot; (see confounder) that are independent of membership in the two groups being compared. In a different context, paired &quot;t&quot;-tests can be used to reduce the effects of confounding factors in an observational study.

====Independent (unpaired) samples====
The independent samples &quot;t&quot;-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, and one variable from each of the two populations is compared. For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100 subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50 subjects to the treatment group and 50 subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two independent samples and would use the unpaired form of the &quot;t&quot;-test.

====Paired samples====
Paired samples &quot;t&quot;-tests typically consist of a sample of matched pairs of similar units, or one group of units that has been tested twice (a &quot;repeated measures&quot; &quot;t&quot;-test).

A typical example of the repeated measures &quot;t&quot;-test would be where subjects are tested prior to a treatment, say for high blood pressure, and the same subjects are tested again after treatment with a blood-pressure-lowering medication. By comparing the same patient&#x27;s numbers before and after treatment, we are effectively using each patient as their own control. That way the correct rejection of the null hypothesis (here: of no difference made by the treatment) can become much more likely, with statistical power increasing simply because the random interpatient variation has now been eliminated. However, an increase of statistical power comes at a price: more tests are required, each subject having to be tested twice. Because half of the sample now depends on the other half, the paired version of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test has only degrees of freedom (with being the total number of observations). Pairs become individual test units, and the sample has to be doubled to achieve the same number of degrees of freedom. Normally, there are degrees of freedom (with being the total number of observations).

A paired samples &quot;t&quot;-test based on a &quot;matched-pairs sample&quot; results from an unpaired sample that is subsequently used to form a paired sample, by using additional variables that were measured along with the variable of interest. The matching is carried out by identifying pairs of values consisting of one observation from each of the two samples, where the pair is similar in terms of other measured variables. This approach is sometimes used in observational studies to reduce or eliminate the effects of confounding factors.

Paired samples &quot;t&quot;-tests are often referred to as &quot;dependent samples &quot;t&quot;-tests&quot;.

==Assumptions==

Most test statistics have the form , where and are functions of the data.

 may be sensitive to the alternative hypothesis (i.e., its magnitude tends to be larger when the alternative hypothesis is true), whereas is a scaling parameter that allows the distribution of to be determined.

As an example, in the one-sample &quot;t&quot;-test
: formula_6
where formula_7 is the sample mean from a sample , of size , is the standard error of the mean, formula_8 is the estimate of the standard deviation of the population, and is the population mean.

The assumptions underlying a &quot;t&quot;-test in the simplest form above are that:
* follows a normal distribution with mean and variance .
* follows a distribution with degrees of freedom. This assumption is met when the observations used for estimating come from a normal distribution (and i.i.d. for each group).
* and are independent.

In the &quot;t&quot;-test comparing the means of two independent samples, the following assumptions should be met:
* The means of the two populations being compared should follow normal distributions. Under weak assumptions, this follows in large samples from the central limit theorem, even when the distribution of observations in each group is non-normal.
* If using Student&#x27;s original definition of the &quot;t&quot;-test, the two populations being compared should have the same variance (testable using &quot;F&quot;-test, Levene&#x27;s test, Bartlett&#x27;s test, or the Brown–Forsythe test; or assessable graphically using a Q–Q plot). If the sample sizes in the two groups being compared are equal, Student&#x27;s original &quot;t&quot;-test is highly robust to the presence of unequal variances. Welch&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test is insensitive to equality of the variances regardless of whether the sample sizes are similar.
* The data used to carry out the test should either be sampled independently from the two populations being compared or be fully paired. This is in general not testable from the data, but if the data are known to be dependent (e.g. paired by test design), a dependent test has to be applied. For partially paired data, the classical independent &quot;t&quot;-tests may give invalid results as the test statistic might not follow a &quot;t&quot; distribution, while the dependent &quot;t&quot;-test is sub-optimal as it discards the unpaired data.

Most two-sample &quot;t&quot;-tests are robust to all but large deviations from the assumptions.

For exactness, the &quot;t&quot;-test and &quot;Z&quot;-test require normality of the sample means, and the &quot;t&quot;-test additionally requires that the sample variance follows a scaled &quot;χ&quot; distribution, and that the sample mean and sample variance be statistically independent. Normality of the individual data values is not required if these conditions are met. By the central limit theorem, sample means of moderately large samples are often well-approximated by a normal distribution even if the data are not normally distributed. However, the sample size required for the sample means to converge to normality depends on the skewness of the distribution of the original data. The sample can vary from 30 to 100 or higher values depending on the skewness. F

For non-normal data, the distribution of the sample variance may deviate substantially from a &quot;χ&quot; distribution.

However, if the sample size is large, Slutsky&#x27;s theorem implies that the distribution of the sample variance has little effect on the distribution of the test statistic. That is, as sample size formula_9 increases:
: formula_10 as per the Central limit theorem,
: formula_11 as per the law of large numbers,
: formula_12.

==Calculations==
Explicit expressions that can be used to carry out various &quot;t&quot;-tests are given below. In each case, the formula for a test statistic that either exactly follows or closely approximates a &quot;t&quot;-distribution under the null hypothesis is given. Also, the appropriate degrees of freedom are given in each case. Each of these statistics can be used to carry out either a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

Once the &quot;t&quot; value and degrees of freedom are determined, a &quot;p&quot;-value can be found using a table of values from Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution. If the calculated &quot;p&quot;-value is below the threshold chosen for statistical significance (usually the 0.10, the 0.05, or 0.01 level), then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

===Slope of a regression line===
Suppose one is fitting the model

: formula_13

where is known, and are unknown, is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and unknown variance , and is the outcome of interest. We want to test the null hypothesis that the slope is equal to some specified value (often taken to be 0, in which case the null hypothesis is that and are uncorrelated).

Let

: formula_14

Then

:formula_15

has a &quot;t&quot;-distribution with degrees of freedom if the null hypothesis is true. The standard error of the slope coefficient:

: formula_16

can be written in terms of the residuals. Let

: formula_17

Then score is given by

: formula_18

Another way to determine the score is

: formula_19

where &quot;r&quot; is the Pearson correlation coefficient.

The score, intercept can be determined from the score, slope:

: formula_20

where is the sample variance.

===Independent two-sample &quot;t&quot;-test===

====Equal sample sizes and variance====
Given two groups (1, 2), this test is only applicable when:
* the two sample sizes are equal,
* it can be assumed that the two distributions have the same variance.
Violations of these assumptions are discussed below.

The statistic to test whether the means are different can be calculated as follows:

: formula_21

where
: formula_22

Here is the pooled standard deviation for , and and are the unbiased estimators of the population variance. The denominator of is the standard error of the difference between two means.

For significance testing, the degrees of freedom for this test is , where is sample size.

====Equal or unequal sample sizes, similar variances ( &lt; &lt; 2)====
This test is used only when it can be assumed that the two distributions have the same variance (when this assumption is violated, see below). 
The previous formulae are a special case of the formulae below, one recovers them when both samples are equal in size: .

The statistic to test whether the means are different can be calculated as follows:
: formula_23

where

: formula_24

is the pooled standard deviation of the two samples: it is defined in this way so that its square is an unbiased estimator of the common variance, whether or not the population means are the same. In these formulae, is the number of degrees of freedom for each group, and the total sample size minus two (that is, ) is the total number of degrees of freedom, which is used in significance testing.

The minimum detectable effect (MDE) is:

formula_25

==== Equal or unequal sample sizes, unequal variances (&quot;s&quot;&quot;X&quot;1 &gt; 2&quot;s&quot;&quot;X&quot;2 or &quot;s&quot;&quot;X&quot;2 &gt; 2&quot;s&quot;&quot;X&quot;1) ====

This test, also known as Welch&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test, is used only when the two population variances are not assumed to be equal (the two sample sizes may or may not be equal) and hence must be estimated separately. The statistic to test whether the population means are different is calculated as

: formula_26

where

: formula_27

Here is the unbiased estimator of the variance of each of the two samples with = number of participants in group ( = 1 or 2). In this case formula_28
is not a pooled variance. For use in significance testing, the distribution of the test statistic is approximated as an ordinary Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution with the degrees of freedom calculated using

: formula_29

This is known as the Welch–Satterthwaite equation. The true distribution of the test statistic actually depends (slightly) on the two unknown population variances (see Behrens–Fisher problem).

===Exact method for unequal variances and sample sizes===

The test deals with the famous Behrens–Fisher problem, i.e., comparing the difference between the means of two normally distributed populations when the variances of the two populations are not assumed to be equal, based on two independent samples.

The test is developed as an exact test that allows for unequal sample sizes and unequal variances of two populations. The exact property still holds even with extremely small and unbalanced sample sizes (e.g. formula_30 vs. formula_31).

The statistic to test whether the means are different can be calculated as follows:

Let formula_32 and formula_33 be the i.i.d. sample vectors (for formula_34) from formula_35 and formula_36 separately.

Let formula_37 be an formula_38 orthogonal matrix whose elements of the first row are all formula_39 similarly, let formula_40 be the first formula_41 rows of an formula_42 orthogonal matrix (whose elements of the first row are all formula_43).

Then formula_44 is an -dimensional normal random vector:

:formula_45

From the above distribution we see that the first element of the vector is

:formula_46

hence the first element is distributed as

:formula_47

and the squares of the remaining elements of are chi-squared distributed

:formula_48

and by construction of the orthogonal matricies and we have

:formula_49

so , the first element of , is statistically independent of the remaining elements by orthogonality.
Finally, take for the test statistic

:formula_50

===Dependent &quot;t&quot;-test for paired samples===
This test is used when the samples are dependent; that is, when there is only one sample that has been tested twice (repeated measures) or when there are two samples that have been matched or &quot;paired&quot;. This is an example of a paired difference test. The &quot;t&quot; statistic is calculated as

: formula_51

where formula_52 and formula_53 are the average and standard deviation of the differences between all pairs. The pairs are e.g. either one person&#x27;s pre-test and post-test scores or between-pairs of persons matched into meaningful groups (for instance, drawn from the same family or age group: see table). The constant is zero if we want to test whether the average of the difference is significantly different. The degree of freedom used is , where represents the number of pairs.

==Worked examples==

Let denote a set obtained by drawing a random sample of six measurements:

:formula_54

and let denote a second set obtained similarly:

:formula_55

These could be, for example, the weights of screws that were manufactured by two different machines.

We will carry out tests of the null hypothesis that the means of the populations from which the two samples were taken are equal.

The difference between the two sample means, each denoted by , which appears in the numerator for all the two-sample testing approaches discussed above, is

:formula_56

The sample standard deviations for the two samples are approximately 0.05 and 0.11, respectively. For such small samples, a test of equality between the two population variances would not be very powerful. Since the sample sizes are equal, the two forms of the two-sample &quot;t&quot;-test will perform similarly in this example.

===Unequal variances===
If the approach for unequal variances (discussed above) is followed, the results are
:formula_57

and the degrees of freedom

:formula_58

The test statistic is approximately 1.959, which gives a two-tailed test &quot;p&quot;-value of 0.09077.

===Equal variances ===
If the approach for equal variances (discussed above) is followed, the results are

:formula_59

and the degrees of freedom

:formula_60

The test statistic is approximately equal to 1.959, which gives a two-tailed &quot;p&quot;-value of 0.07857.

==Related statistical tests==
===Alternatives to the &quot;t&quot;-test for location problems===
The &quot;t&quot;-test provides an exact test for the equality of the means of two i.i.d. normal populations with unknown, but equal, variances. (Welch&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test is a nearly exact test for the case where the data are normal but the variances may differ.) For moderately large samples and a one tailed test, the &quot;t&quot;-test is relatively robust to moderate violations of the normality assumption. In large enough samples, the &quot;t&quot;-test asymptotically approaches the &quot;z&quot;-test, and becomes robust even to large deviations from normality.

If the data are substantially non-normal and the sample size is small, the &quot;t&quot;-test can give misleading results. See Location test for Gaussian scale mixture distributions for some theory related to one particular family of non-normal distributions.

When the normality assumption does not hold, a non-parametric alternative to the &quot;t&quot;-test may have better statistical power. However, when data are non-normal with differing variances between groups, a &quot;t&quot;-test may have better type-1 error control than some non-parametric alternatives. Furthermore, non-parametric methods, such as the Mann-Whitney U test discussed below, typically do not test for a difference of means, so should be used carefully if a difference of means is of primary scientific interest. For example, Mann-Whitney U test will keep the type 1 error at the desired level alpha if both groups have the same distribution. It will also have power in detecting an alternative by which group B has the same distribution as A but after some shift by a constant (in which case there would indeed be a difference in the means of the two groups). However, there could be cases where group A and B will have different distributions but with the same means (such as two distributions, one with positive skewness and the other with a negative one, but shifted so to have the same means). In such cases, MW could have more than alpha level power in rejecting the Null hypothesis but attributing the interpretation of difference in means to such a result would be incorrect.

In the presence of an outlier, the &quot;t&quot;-test is not robust. For example, for two independent samples when the data distributions are asymmetric (that is, the distributions are skewed) or the distributions have large tails, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test) can have three to four times higher power than the &quot;t&quot;-test. The nonparametric counterpart to the paired samples &quot;t&quot;-test is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. For a discussion on choosing between the &quot;t&quot;-test and nonparametric alternatives, see Lumley, et al. (2002).

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) generalizes the two-sample &quot;t&quot;-test when the data belong to more than two groups.

===A design which includes both paired observations and independent observations===
When both paired observations and independent observations are present in the two sample design, assuming data are missing completely at random (MCAR), the paired observations or independent observations may be discarded in order to proceed with the standard tests above. Alternatively making use of all of the available data, assuming normality and MCAR, the generalized partially overlapping samples &quot;t&quot;-test could be used.

===Multivariate testing===

A generalization of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot; statistic, called Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-squared statistic, allows for the testing of hypotheses on multiple (often correlated) measures within the same sample. For instance, a researcher might submit a number of subjects to a personality test consisting of multiple personality scales (e.g. the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). Because measures of this type are usually positively correlated, it is not advisable to conduct separate univariate &quot;t&quot;-tests to test hypotheses, as these would neglect the covariance among measures and inflate the chance of falsely rejecting at least one hypothesis (Type I error). In this case a single multivariate test is preferable for hypothesis testing. Fisher&#x27;s Method for combining multiple tests with &quot;alpha&quot; reduced for positive correlation among tests is one. Another is Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; statistic follows a &quot;T&quot; distribution. However, in practice the distribution is rarely used, since tabulated values for &quot;T&quot; are hard to find. Usually, &quot;T&quot; is converted instead to an &quot;F&quot; statistic.

For a one-sample multivariate test, the hypothesis is that the mean vector () is equal to a given vector (). The test statistic is Hotelling&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;:

:formula_61

where is the sample size, is the vector of column means and is an sample covariance matrix.

For a two-sample multivariate test, the hypothesis is that the mean vectors () of two samples are equal. The test statistic is Hotelling&#x27;s two-sample &quot;t&quot;:

:formula_62

=== The two-sample &quot;t&quot;-test is a special case of simple linear regression ===

The two-sample &quot;t&quot;-test is a special case of simple linear regression as illustrated by the following example.

A clinical trial examines 6 patients given drug or placebo. Three (3) patients get 0 units of drug (the placebo group). Three (3) patients get 1 unit of drug (the active treatment group). At the end of treatment, the researchers measure the change from baseline in the number of words that each patient can recall in a memory test.

A table of the patients&#x27; word recall and drug dose values are shown below. 

Data and code are given for the analysis using the R programming language with the codice_1 and codice_2functions for the t-test and linear regression. Here are the same (fictitious) data above generated in R.
&gt; word.recall.data=data.frame(drug.dose=c(0,0,0,1,1,1), word.recall=c(1,2,3,5,6,7)) 
Perform the &quot;t&quot;-test. Notice that the assumption of equal variance, codice_3, is required to make the analysis exactly equivalent to simple linear regression.
&gt; with(word.recall.data, t.test(word.recall~drug.dose, var.equal=T))
Running the R code gives the following results.
*The mean word.recall in the 0 drug.dose group is 2. 
*The mean word.recall in the 1 drug.dose group is 6. 
*The difference between treatment groups in the mean word.recall is 6 – 2 = 4.
* The difference in word.recall between drug doses is significant (p=0.00805).

Perform a linear regression of the same data. Calculations may be performed using the R function codice_4 for a linear model. 

&gt; word.recall.data.lm = lm(word.recall~drug.dose, data=word.recall.data)
&gt; summary(word.recall.data.lm)
The linear regression provides a table of coefficients and p-values.

The table of coefficients gives the following results.
*The estimate value of 2 for the intercept is the mean value of the word recall when the drug dose is 0. 
*The estimate value of 4 for the drug dose indicates that for a 1-unit change in drug dose (from 0 to 1) there is a 4-unit change in mean word recall (from 2 to 6). This is the slope of the line joining the two group means.
*The p-value that the slope of 4 is different from 0 is p = 0.00805.

The coefficients for the linear regression specify the slope and intercept of the line that joins the two group means, as illustrated in the graph. The intercept is 2 and the slope is 4.

Compare the result from the linear regression to the result from the &quot;t&quot;-test.
* From the &quot;t&quot;-test, the difference between the group means is 6-2=4. 
*From the regression, the slope is also 4 indicating that a 1-unit change in drug dose (from 0 to 1) gives a 4-unit change in mean word recall (from 2 to 6).
* The &quot;t&quot;-test &quot;p&quot;-value for the difference in means, and the regression p-value for the slope, are both 0.00805. The methods give identical results.

This example shows that, for the special case of a simple linear regression where there is a single x-variable that has values 0 and 1, the &quot;t&quot;-test gives the same results as the linear regression. The relationship can also be shown algebraically.

Recognizing this relationship between the &quot;t&quot;-test and linear regression facilitates the use of multiple linear regression and multi-way analysis of variance. These alternatives to &quot;t&quot;-tests allow for the inclusion of additional explanatory variables that are associated with the response. Including such additional explanatory variables using regression or anova reduces the otherwise unexplained variance, and commonly yields greater power to detect differences than do two-sample &quot;t&quot;-tests.
==Software implementations==
Many spreadsheet programs and statistics packages, such as QtiPlot, LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata, DAP, gretl, R, Python, PSPP, Wolfram Mathematica, MATLAB and Minitab, include implementations of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test.

<text>Fertile is an unincorporated community in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada, located west of the Manitoba border and north of the U.S. border in the Rural Municipality of Storthoaks No. 31.

== Demographics ==
The population was once as high as 50 people, but now is supported by surrounding farm families. Fertile once had its own school (shrined), grain elevators (2), general store, skating/curling rink, United church, community hall and post office. Only the latter two survive. Families making up the current community include; Pickard(2), Holden(2), Malin (3), Rekken, Poirier, Millions, Bouchard (2), VanderWaal, Poirier. Fall suppers and an annual event, be it a comedy act, a magician, etc., used to be held to raise money to support the community hall.

<doc id="536096" wikidata="Q4002117" url="?curid=536096" title="USS Michigan (1843)">
<text>USS &quot;Michigan was the [[United States Navy]]&#x27;s first iron-hulled warship and served during the [[American Civil War]]. She was renamedUSS &quot;Wolverine in 1905.

==Construction and design==
The sidewheel steamer &quot;Michigan&quot; was built in response to the British Government arming two steamers in response to the Canadian rebellions in the late 1830s with Secretary of the Navy Abel P. Upshur selecting an iron hull partly as a test of practicability of using such a &quot;cheap and indestructible a material&quot; for ships. The ship was designed by Samuel Hartt, and fabricated in parts at Pittsburgh in the last half of 1842, transported overland and assembled at Erie. The launch on 5 December 1843 was unsuccessful with the ship sticking after moving some down the ways and efforts to complete the launch ended by nightfall. On returning in the morning Hartt found &quot;Michigan&quot; had &quot;launched herself in the night&quot; and was floating offshore in Lake Erie.

By 1908 the ship was noted in the journal &quot;The American Marine Engineer&quot; as being the oldest metal-hulled vessel then existing and of interest to engineers because of the ship&#x27;s age. The two engines were inclined simple steam engines of with a stroke that were original and running well in 1908. The first of three sets of boilers were return flue type that lasted fifty years before finally being replaced by bricked in return tube types. The operating pressure was low, sufficient to drive the engines at 20 rpm, with engine room piping of thick copper connecting with brass flange joints. When, about 1905, the ship finally changed from kerosene lights to electric, a special engine for the dynamo had to be constructed to operate on the low pressure steam. The steam was also used in a peculiar system for repelling boarders with hot water direct from the boiler. Coal consumption before the latest modifications was two tons per hour and after the modifications was as low as one half ton per hour. The ship carried two steam launches. The ship had never made even ten knots until dispatched from the harbor at Cleveland to Buffalo to prevent riots on the assassination of President William McKinley 6 September 1901 and, with the safeties weighted, she made almost fourteen knots at 30 rpm at one point.

==Early career==
&quot;Michigan&quot; commissioned 29 September 1844 under the command of Commander William Inman and operated on the Great Lakes out of Erie, Pennsylvania, throughout her career. In May 1851, she assisted in the arrest of Mr. James Jesse Strang, known as &quot;King James I&quot;, who headed a dissident Mormon colony on Beaver Island at the head of Lake Michigan, some from the Straits of Mackinac. Strang was soon freed, but was assassinated by two of his followers on 19 June 1856. The assassins fled to &quot;Michigan&quot; for sanctuary and were taken to Mackinac and released.

In an encounter with Great Lakes &quot;timber pirates&quot; in the 1850s, a steamer rammed &quot;Michigan&quot;. The pirate vessel was badly damaged in the maneuver, and was captured.

&quot;Michigan&quot; was the first iron-hulled ship in the US Navy.

==American Civil War==

During the American Civil War, &quot;Michigan&quot; was armed with a 30-pounder Parrott rifle, five 20-pounder Parrott rifles, six 24-pounder smoothbores, and two 12-pounder boat howitzers. The Confederate States of America considered launching attacks against the North from Canada. Early in 1863, Lieutenant William Henry Murdaugh, CSN, planned to lead a group of Confederate naval officers to Canada where they would purchase a small steamer, man her with Canadians and steam to Erie to board &quot;Michigan&quot; and use her against locks and shipping on the Great Lakes. However, Confederate President Jefferson Davis didn&#x27;t approve the plan.

&quot;Michigan&quot; cruised on the Great Lakes during most of the war providing an element of stability and security. On 28 July 1863, a short time after New York City had been seriously shaken by riots, its Virginia-born Commander John C. Carter reported from Detroit, &quot;I found the people suffering under serious apprehensions of a riot...The presence of the ships perhaps did something toward overawing the refractory, and certainly did much to allay the apprehensions of the excited, doubting people.&quot; During August 1863, &quot;Michigan&quot; was called on for similar service in Buffalo, New York.

During 1864, rumors of Confederate conspiracies in Canada were heard again. In March, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered &quot;Michigan&quot; to be &quot;prepared for active service as soon as the ice will permit.&quot; In the autumn, the Confederates finally struck. Led by Acting Master John Yates Beall, 20 Confederates embarked on the steamer as passengers and soon seized her. They next captured and burned the steamer . Meanwhile, Captain Charles H. Cole, CSA, a Confederate agent in the Lake Erie region, was attempting to gain the trust of &quot;Michigan&quot;″s officers as the &quot;Michigan&quot; lay off Johnson&#x27;s Island helping to guard Confederate prisoners. However, Commander Carter discovered Cole″s and had him arrested before Beall reached Johnson&#x27;s Island on &quot;Philo Parsons&quot;. When the prearranged signals from shore were not made, Beall reluctantly abandoned his plan and retired to Sandwich (now Windsor, Ontario) where he stripped and burned &quot;Philo Parsons&quot;.

==Later U.S. Navy service==
After the Civil War, &quot;Michigan&quot; remained in U.S. Navy service, and was the ship which intercepted and interned the army of the Fenian Brotherhood as it returned from its invasion of Canada near Buffalo in 1866. On 16 July 1902 she was rammed at dock in Erie, Pennsylvania, by ore carrier moving at full steam, striking &quot;Michigan&#x27;s&quot; bow a glancing blow, then driving between &quot;Michigan&quot; and the dock carrying away the hawsers. &quot;Michigan&quot; was then shoved down the harbor. &quot;Michigan&quot; had her bowsprit, forecastle and forward bulkhead wrecked and she was scraped along the entire port side. The six pound Driggs-Schroeder rifles of the rear port battery were bent out of true and a boat on the port davits was demolished. The damage was between $10,000 and $15,000. &quot;Michigan&quot; was renamed USS &quot;Wolverine&quot; on 17 June 1905 to free up the name &quot;Michigan&quot; for use by the new battleship .

&quot;Wolverine&quot; was decommissioned on 6 May 1912.

==Pennsylvania Naval Militia service==
&quot;Wolverine&quot; was turned over to the Pennsylvania Naval Militia, which she served for 11 years, making training cruises in the summer for the United States Naval Reserve. For the 1913 centennial of the War of 1812 Battle of Lake Erie, &quot;Wolverine&quot; towed the brig from port to port as part of the celebrations. In mid-1920, when the U.S. Navy adopted its modern alphanumeric hull number system, she was classified as a &quot;miscellaneous auxiliary&quot; and designated IX-31. On 12 August 1923, a connecting rod of &quot;Wolverine&quot;″s port cylinder broke, ending her active career.

==Relic==
In 1927, &quot;Wolverine&quot;″s hulk was pushed up onto a sandbank in Misery Bay on the Presque Isle State Park Peninsula and loaned to the city of Erie, Pennsylvania, as a relic. She was sold to the Foundation for the Preservation of the Original USS &quot;Michigan&quot;, Inc., on 19 July 1948. But when fund-raising efforts failed to acquire sufficient money for her restoration and preservation, she was cut up and sold for scrap in 1949 to the Ace Junk &amp; Salvage Company. Sam Tanenbaum, proprietor, donated the prow back to the city of Erie.

In 1950, &quot;Wolverine&quot;″s prow was erected as a monument in Wolverine Park in Erie, near the shipyard where she had been built. On 22 February 1998, the prow was moved to the Erie Maritime Museum for restoration. Today it can be viewed inside the museum.

<text>The College World Series (CWS), officially the NCAA Men&#x27;s College World Series (MCWS), is a baseball tournament held each June in Omaha, Nebraska. It is the culmination of the NCAA Division I baseball tournament—featuring 64 teams in the first round—which determines the champion of NCAA Division I level college baseball. The eight participating teams are split into two, four-team, double-elimination brackets, with the winners of each bracket playing in a best-of-three championship series.

==History==
The first edition of the College World Series was held in 1947 at Hyames Field in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The tournament was held there again in 1948, but was moved to Lawrence Stadium in Wichita, Kansas, for the 1949 tournament. Since 1950, the College World Series (CWS) has been held in Omaha, Nebraska. It was held at Rosenblatt Stadium from 1950 through 2010; starting in 2011, it has been held at Charles Schwab Field Omaha (formerly TD Ameritrade Park Omaha). The name &quot;College World Series&quot; is derived from that of the Major League Baseball World Series championship; it is currently an MLB trademark licensed to the NCAA.

The event&#x27;s official name was changed to &quot;Men&#x27;s College World Series&quot; no later than 2008. The most recent hosting agreement between the NCAA and the city of Omaha and related entities, signed in that year, states, &quot;The official name of the [championship] shall be the &quot;NCAA Men&#x27;s College World Series&quot;&quot;. However, as of October 2021, the CWS logo still appeared on the NCAA&#x27;s official D-I baseball tournament bracket, and on the front page of the NCAA&#x27;s official CWS website, without the word &quot;Men&#x27;s&quot;. The NCAA has since added &quot;Men&#x27;s&quot; to the event&#x27;s logo, and both the NCAA and College World Series of Omaha, Inc. (CWS Omaha), the nonprofit group that organizes the event, now consistently use the phrase &quot;Men&#x27;s College World Series&quot; to describe it.

On March 13, 2020, it was announced that the 2020 College World Series was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first time in the event&#x27;s history it had been canceled.

===Contract extension===
On June 10, 2008, the NCAA and CWS Omaha announced a new 25-year contract extension, keeping the MCWS in Omaha through 2035. A memorandum of understanding had been reached by all parties on April 30.

The currently binding contract began in 2011, the same year the tournament moved from Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium to the venue now known as Charles Schwab Field Omaha, a new ballpark across from CHI Health Center Omaha.

===Format history and changes===
* 1947 – Eight teams were divided into two, four-team, single-elimination playoffs. The two winners then met in a best-of-three final in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
* 1948 – Similar to 1947, but the two, four-team playoffs were changed to double-elimination tournaments. The two winners continued to meet in a best-of-three final in Kalamazoo. The teams were selected from the NCAA&#x27;s eight districts, with a local committee choosing its representative based on their own criteria, which might or might not include committee selections, conference champions, and district playoffs.
* 1949 – The final was expanded to a four-team, double-elimination format and the site changed to Wichita, Kansas. Eight teams began the playoffs with the four finalists decided by a best-of-three district format.
* 1950–1953 – An eight-team, double-elimination format for the College World Series coincided with the move to Omaha, Nebraska, in 1950. A national baseball committee chose one team from each of the eight NCAA districts.
* 1954–1975 – Preliminary rounds determined the eight CWS teams, and the total number of teams in the preliminary round ranged from 21 to 32. The format of the CWS remained the same as 1950.
* 1976–1981 – The number of preliminary-round teams was increased to 34.
* 1982–1984 – The number of preliminary-round teams was increased to 36.
* 1985 – The number of preliminary-round teams was increased to 38.
* 1986 – The number of preliminary-round teams was increased to 40.
* 1987 – The number of preliminary-round teams was increased to 48, with teams split into eight, six-team regionals. The regionals were a test of endurance, as teams had to win at least four games over four days, sometimes five if a team dropped into the loser&#x27;s bracket, placing a premium on pitching. In the last two years of the six-team regional format, the eventual CWS champion – LSU in 1997 and Southern California in 1998 – had to battle back from the loser&#x27;s bracket in the regional to advance to Omaha. Unlike the current 64 team tournament, the CWS pairings were set after the regional tournaments.
* 1988–1998 – The format for the CWS was changed for the first time since 1950 with the 1988 College World Series, when the tournament was divided into 2 four-team double-elimination brackets, with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship game. The single-game championship was designed for network television, with the final game on CBS on a Saturday afternoon.
* 1999–2002 – With some 293 Division I teams playing, the NCAA expanded the overall tournament to a 64-team field in 1999. Teams were divided into 16 four-team double-elimination regionals. The regional winners advanced to the Super Regional round, which had 8 best-of-three series to advance to the CWS. Within each region, teams were seeded 1 to 4. Additionally, the top 8 teams in the tournament were given &quot;national seeds&quot; and placed in different Super Regionals so no national seeds could meet before the CWS. The 64-team bracket was set at the beginning of the championship and teams are not reseeded for the CWS. Since the 1999 College World Series, the four-team brackets in the CWS have been determined by the results of super-regional play, much like the NCAA basketball tournament.
* 2003–2017 – The championship final became a best-of-three series between the two four-team bracket winners, with games scheduled for three consecutive evenings. In the results shown below, Score indicates the score of the championship game(s) only. In 2008, the start of the CWS was moved back one day, and an extra day of rest was added in between bracket play and the championship series.
* 2018–present – The number of national seeds increased from 8 to 16. Each Super Regional featured the winners of regionals in which the numerical sum of those regions&#x27; national seeds totaled 17 (1 vs. 16, 2 vs. 15, etc.). No other format changes were made.

==Results==
===Teams reaching the finals===


===Best performances by conference===

* CIBA was California Intercollegiate Baseball Association that competed as a division under the Pacific Coast Conference which operated under its own Charter.
* Independents = Miami Hurricanes (4) and Holy Cross Crusaders (1)
* SCBA was Southern California Baseball Association (1977–84).
* The Big 12 does not claim any national championships, including baseball, that were won as members of the Big Eight and makes no claim to the history or records of the Big Eight.
* The Western Athletic Conference claims 7 national championships in baseball by former members. There are no gaps in its existence; the WAC has existed continuously since its formation in 1962.
* Coastal Carolina won the 2016 CWS as a member of the Big South Conference less than 24 hours before officially joining the Sun Belt Conference.
* Missouri won the 1954 CWS as a member of the Big Eight Conference.

==Awards==
The College World Series Most Outstanding Player award is presented to the best player at each College World Series finals (first awarded in 1949).

An All-Tournament Team consisting of the best players of the tournament has also been announced for each tournament since 1958.

<text>The Stillwater River rises 15 miles south of the border between Montana (United States) and Alberta (Canada), west of Glacier National Park in the Kootenai National Forest. It runs mainly south to Duck Lake, then Upper Stillwater Lake, Lagoni Lake and on to Lower Stillwater Lake. It then flows south to Kalispell where it joins the Whitefish River, very near where that river enters the Flathead River.

<text>Waziristan (Pashto, Ormuri, , ) is a mountainous region of Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Waziristan region administratively splits among three districts: North Waziristan, Lower South Waziristan District, and Upper South Waziristan District. Waziristan region, consisted of three districts, covers around and is mainly populated by the Burki, Mehsud, The Wolves, &amp; Wazir Pashtun tribe, who speak the Waziri dialect of the Pashto language.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Waziristan&quot; is associated with the ancestor of the Pashtun tribes, Mehsud (The Wolves), named Wazir. Both tribes descended from him and are predominantly settled in the Waziristan region.

== Overview and history ==

Waziristan lies between the Kurram River and the Gomal River. It borders the Kurram Agency in the north, Bannu in the northeast, Tank in the east, Dera Ismail Khan in the southeast, Sherani and Musakhel districts of Balochistan in the south and Khost, Paktia, and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan in the west.

Waziristan is divided into two districts, North Waziristan and South Waziristan. According to the 2017 census report, the population of North Waziristan was 543,254 while that of South Waziristan was 674,065. The two parts have quite distinct characteristics, though both are inhabited by the Wazir and Mahsud (or Maseed The Real wolves) tribes. They have a reputation as formidable warriors.

=== British Era ===
The British entered Waziristan in 1894, when the boundary with Afghanistan, known as the Durand Line was determined. They divided Waziristan into two agencies, North Waziristan and South Waziristan; they also introduced a regular system of land record and revenue administration for the most fertile part of the Tochi valley. After the British military operations, a Political Agent for South Waziristan was permanently appointed with its headquarters at Wanna; another was appointed for North Waziristan with headquarters at Miranshah.

=== Most Known People (Mashar &amp; Malak) of Waziristan (1950–2000) ===
*Ramajan GigaKhel, Mehsud, Sub-tribe, Nano Khel, A well known mashar of Dre Maseed of his time from 1960s to 1999.
*Malik Haji Muhammad Qarib Burki, Former Chief of Burki tribe. A well known mashar of Burki tribe.
*Malik Irfan Burki, Chief of Burki tribe &amp; also President of Kaniguram Press Club.

=== Waziristan Revolt (1919–1920) ===

In the rugged and remote region of Waziristan on British India&#x27;s northwest border with Afghanistan, mountain tribes of Muslim fighters rebelled against the British Indian Army in numerous operations. The Waziristan Revolt of 1919–1920 was sparked by the Afghan invasion of British India in 1919. Though the British made peace with the Afghans, the Waziri and Mahsud tribesmen gave the imperial (almost entirely Indian) forces a very difficult fight. Some of the tribesmen were veterans of the British-organised local militias that were irregular elements of the British Indian Army, and used some modern Lee–Enfield rifles against the British Indian forces sent into Waziristan. One aspect of this conflict was the effective use of air power against the Waziris and Mahsuds. This is similar to Royal Air Force tactics in suppressing the Arab Revolt in Iraq in 1920 and 1921.

=== Faqir of Ipi ===

In 1935–36, a Hindu-Muslim clash occurred over a Hindu girl of Bannu, who was abducted and forced to convert to Islam. The tribesmen rallied around Mirzali Khan, a Tori Khel Wazir, who was later given the title of &quot;the Faqir of Ipi&quot; by the British. Jihad was declared against the British. Mirzali Khan, with his huge &quot;lashkar&quot; (force), started a guerrilla warfare against the British forces in Waziristan.

In 1938, Mirzali Khan shifted from Ipi to Gurwek, a remote village on the Durand Line, where he declared an independent state and continued the raids against the British forces. In June 1947, Mirzali Khan, along with his allies, including the Khudai Khidmatgars and members of the Provincial Assembly, declared the Bannu Resolution. The resolution demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan, composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution. After the creation of Pakistan in August 1947, Mirzali Khan and his followers refused to recognise Pakistan, and launched a campaign against Pakistan. They continued their guerilla warfare against the new nation&#x27;s government. He didn&#x27;t surrender to the government of Pakistan throughout his life but his movement diminished after 1954 when his Commander-in-chief Mehar Dil Khan Khattak surrendered to the Pakistani authorities. Towards the end of his life, he expressed regret and said that Afghanistan deceived and used him for its political gains in the name of Islam. He also instructed his supporters that they should never help Afghanistan against Pakistan with any plots made against Pakistan.

=== U.S. War on Terror ===

In the early stage of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, when the Taliban started fleeing into Pakistan, the local leaders, or Maliks, began a campaign among their locals to host the foreigners. Since then, around 200 Maliks have been assassinated by the local Taliban through targeted killings.

To end the Waziristan war, Pakistan signed the Waziristan Accord with chieftains from the self-styled Islamic Emirate of Waziristan on 5 September 2006. The Islamic militants in Waziristan are said to have close affiliations with the Taliban. Waziristan is often mentioned as a haven for al-Qaeda fighters. There is speculation that some al-Qaeda leaders have found refuge in the area controlled by the Emirate, which is a staging ground for militant operations in Afghanistan.

On 4 June 2007, the National Security Council of Pakistan met to decide the fate of Waziristan and take up a number of political and administrative issues to control the &quot;Talibanization&quot; of the area. The meeting was chaired by President Pervez Musharraf and attended by the Chief Ministers and Governors of all four provinces. They discussed the deteriorating law and order situation and the threat posed to state security. The government decided to take a number of actions to stop the &quot;Talibanization&quot; and to crush the armed militancy in the Tribal regions and the NWFP.

Due to the ongoing military operations against the Taliban, nearly 100,000 people have already fled to Afghanistan&#x27;s Khost province to seek shelter. The UN and other aid agencies are helping more than 470,000 people who have been displaced from Pakistan&#x27;s North Waziristan region due to the ongoing military operations.

The Ministry of the Interior has played a large part in the information gathering for the operations against the militants and their institutions. The Ministry of the Interior has prepared a list of militant commanders operating in the region and they have also prepared a list of seminaries for monitoring. (Waziristan is a tribal area, and in any tribal area of Pakistan, nobody can deploy police. There are other options like frontier corps (militia) and Khasadar (local tribesmen force).) The government is also trying to strengthen law enforcement in the area by providing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police with weapons, bullet-proof jackets, and night-vision devices. The paramilitary Frontier Corps is to be provided with artillery and APCs. State agencies are actively exploring methods to disrupt unauthorized FM radio channels through jamming techniques.

The US drone strikes programme has been responsible for numerous bombings in Waziristan, carried out with the approval of the Pakistani government.

The Wazir tribes are divided into clans governed by male village elders who meet in a tribal jirga. Socially and religiously, Waziristan is an extremely conservative area. Women are carefully guarded, and every household must be headed by a male figure. Tribal cohesiveness is also kept strong by means of the so-called Collective Responsibility Acts in the Frontier Crimes Regulations, which has since been repealed following the merger of FATA to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in May 2018.

Taliban presence in the area has been an issue of international concern in the War on Terrorism particularly since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In 2014, about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from Waziristan as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb, a military offensive conducted by the Pakistan Armed Forces along the Pakistan – Afghanistan border.

== North Waziristan ==
North Waziristan&#x27;s capital is Miranshah. The area is mostly inhabited by the Dawar Tribe and the Utmanzai branch of the Darwesh Khel Waziris, who are related to Ahmedzai Waziris of South Waziristan, who live in fortified mountain villages, including Razmak, Datta Khel, Spin wam, Dosali, Shawa and Shawal. The Dawars (also known as Daurr or Daur), who live in the main Tochi Valley, farm in the valleys below in villages including Miranshah, Hamzoni, Darpakhel, Muhammadkhel, Boya, Degan, Banda, Ngharkali, Palangzai, Mirali, Edak, Hurmaz, Mussaki, Hassukhel, Ziraki, Tapi, Issori, Haiderkhel and Khaddi irrigated by the river Tochi. They are related to the Banuchis who live in the neighboring Bannu District.

== Dissolution of South Waziristan ==
The South Waziristan was a district with its district headquarters at Wanna. South Waziristan, comprising about , previously was the most volatile agency of Pakistan. Up until 2021 it was not under the direct administration of the government of Pakistan, South Waziristan was previously and indirectly governed by a political agent, who has been either an outsider or a Waziri—a system inherited from the British Raj. From January 2021 to April 2022, South Waziristan served as a district of the adjacent KPK province. In south Waziristan Agency, there are three tribes, Ahmadzai Wazir, Mahsud Wazir and Burki. Burki and Urmarh are the same tribe. In 2022, Government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa led by PTI decided to divide South Waziristan District into two districts, Lower South Waziristan District, and Upper South Waziristan District.

Jacobs cites a story from the 16 July 1974 issue of The Wall Street Journal in which a Pathan husband in Waziristan reportedly cut off his wife&#x27;s nose because he was jealous. Thinking the better of it, he took her to a surgeon to have the injury repaired. Upon finding out that an operation would cost thirty rupees, he called it off, saying he could buy a new wife for eighty rupees. Jacobs cites this incident as evidence contradicting the platitude that society is based on the family. Instead, each family is based on whatever society it finds itself in.

<text>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) is a nonprofit professional association whose stated mission is to &quot;support and empower game developers around the world in achieving fulfilling and sustainable careers.&quot;

The IGDA is incorporated in the United States as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization. It has over 12,000 members from all fields of game development. In recognition of the wide-ranging, multidisciplinary nature of interactive entertainment, everyone who participates in any way in the game development process is welcome to join the IGDA.

== History ==

The beginnings of the IGDA emerged from several other organizations for computer game developers which were forming in the late 1980s and early 1990s:
* The Computer Game Designers Symposium, later known as the Computer Game Developers Conference, was started in 1988 by Chris Crawford. He had already been producing a bimonthly newsletter for game developers, &quot;The Journal of Computer Game Design&quot;, since 1987. One of the subscribers, game programmer Nicky Robinson, suggested that he hold a gathering. Crawford took her suggestion, made announcements in two issues of the journal, and hosted the first event in April 1988 in his living room in San Jose, California.
* The Los Angeles Computer Game Developers meetings, 1989–1991, created by Richard Pferdner and David Walker
* The Bay Area Computer Entertainment Developers meetings, 1991–1993, created by Tim Brengle and David Walker, which met monthly
** In 1992, in response to a need for a professional organization, Brengle and Walker also created the Computer Entertainment Developers Association. Dues were $75/year, and included a subscription to Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Computer Game Design&quot;. CEDA gained members both locally and internationally.

Crawford&#x27;s living room event in April 1988, the CGDC, had brought in 26 or 27 game developers. It was such a success that on the spot a steering committee was formed to host a larger event six months later at a Holiday Inn in Milpitas, California, which drew 127 developers. Then this event continued to be held each Spring. It grew rapidly, by 50% or more each year, moving to larger and larger venues. Early conference directors included developers such as Crawford, Brenda Laurel, Nicky Robinson, Anne Westfall, and Ernest W. Adams.

In 1994 the CGDC then sponsored its own association, the Computer Game Developers Association, or CGDA, taking over the membership list from Walker and Brengle&#x27;s CEDA. Initial board members included David Walker, Tim Brengle, Anne Westfall, and Ernest Adams, who became Chair. Jennifer Pahlka became the first Executive Director. In 1997 when elections were held, Noah Falstein became the first elected chair.

A separate organization was also created in 1996, the IGDN, International Game Developers Network, run by people such as Marc Mencher and Gordon Walton. It had its own conference, the International Game Developers Network Conference, launched in 1998 in Austin, Texas.

The two organizations, the CGDA and the IGDN, ran more or less in parallel for a while, and then merged in 1999 as the International Game Developers Association, with David Walker and Tim Brengle as members No. 1 and 2. Hap Aziz on the board of the CGDA and David Weinstein on the board of the IGDN were tasked with merging the two organizations and named the IGDA as a combination of the CGDA and the IGDN.

== Structure ==
The &quot;board of directors&quot; is the governing body of the IGDA. As of 2023, Margaret Krohn is the chair of the board of directors.

Day-to-day operations of the IGDA are handled by Executive Directors. Since 1994, these have been:

* Jennifer Pahlka, 1994
* Jason Della Rocca, 2000
* Joshua Caulfield, 2009
* Gordon Bellamy, 2010
* Kate Edwards, 2012
* Jennifer MacLean, 2017 
* Renee Gittins, 2019–2022
* Jakin Vela, 2022–present

Other structures within the IGDA include:

* &quot;Chapters&quot;, intended to provide an informal way to connect game developers within local communities. Chapters vary greatly in size and meeting attendance. They provide forums, for example, for discussions on current issues in the computer gaming industry and demos of the latest games.
* &quot;Special Interest Groups&quot;, better known as SIGs, are intended to spark developer interest in a specific topics or disciplines. For example, the Game Education SIG has a stated mission &quot;To create a community resource that will strengthen the academic membership of the IGDA while enhancing the education of future and current game developers.&quot; Some SIGs sponsor events, such as creating the Global Game Jam.
* &quot;Committees&quot; are generally formed by the IGDA to conduct research into a subject, normally for a short period, leading to a single report. Some, however, are semi-permanent, and produce yearly reports. Some of these reports lead to gaming industry standards.

== Advocacy ==

Aside from bringing game developers together, the IGDA focuses on the following issues present in the game development industry:

* Quality of life – making the process of game development easier and more pleasant for everyone.
* Diversity – ensuring that people from a wide range of backgrounds and their needs are represented in the game development industry
* Anti-Censorship – recognizing games as an art form, and as a medium of expression
* Business and Legal Issues – empowering the development community with business knowledge and advocating for developers
* Student and Academic Relations – setting curriculum guidelines, enhancing collaboration between industry and academia and providing guidance to students wanting a career in games

Starting in 2014, the association has been working with the FBI to deal with the online harassment of developers.

The IGDA introduced the first annual Global Industry Game Awards (GIGA) in August 2021, in collaboration with devcom, a branch of the annual Gamescom convention devoted to video game development. The awards were designed &quot;to celebrate the contributions of individuals and discipline teams across the many facets of game development&quot;, with several awards given in each category of Art, Audio, Design, Engineering and Technology, Support, Writing and Narrative, and other awards, rather than focusing on the whole studio behind a given game.

== Programs ==

The IGDA, through its chapters and SIGs, organizes hundreds of events for members of the game development industry including chapter meetings and meetups. However, there are larger events that are organized that bring IGDA&#x27;s international members together:
* IGDA Summit – The IGDA Summit highlights the expertise, insights and experience of the global IGDA membership – from board members and staff to key volunteers and engaged members.
* IGDA Scholars Program – The IGDA Scholars Program is a program that awards promising students in game development and related disciplines passes to key conferences related to game development (e.g. Game Developers Conference and the Electronic Entertainment Expo) and includes mentorship from key members of the game development industry, opportunities to visit local studios or meetings with senior figures in the industry.
* IGDA Leadership Track at Southern Interactive Entertainment and Game Expo (SIEGE) – The IGDA Leadership Track at SIEGE will encompass a broad range of topics pertinent to the heads of game studios.
* IGDA Global Mentorship Program – As described on the IGDA website: it &quot;provides a way for IGDA members to support each other and to progress their career. The program allows for mentees to get advice from people in their field and mentors to practice mentorship and build relationships.&quot;

=== Events ===

* Global Game Jam – Now managed by the Global Game Jam, Inc., the Global Game Jam is an event that organizes developers, artists and game designers to create games within a 48-hour period.
* IGDA Leadership Forum – Focuses on advancing the state of the art in game production and management and encompasses a broad range of leadership topics relevant to game development.

== Controversies ==

In 2009, Timothy Langdell resigned from the IGDA board after a movement to remove him due to his activities in enforcing the trademark name &quot;Edge&quot; used by Edge Games.

During the GDC 2013 a party was hosted by co-presenters IGDA and the start-up incubator YetiZen. The event featured at least three girls in white outfits dancing, one was in a shorter t-shirt, another in a furry outfit. Backlash over the presence of these female dancers resulted in the several people resigning in protest, most notably Brenda Romero from the IGDA&#x27;s Women in Games Special Interest Group steering committee. On the day following the party IGDA Executive Director Kate Edwards issued an apology stating &quot;We regret that the IGDA was involved in this situation. We do not condone activities that objectify or demean women or any other group of people.&quot;

On 20 November 2014 the IGDA added a link to &quot;A Twitter tool to block some of the worst offenders in the recent wave of harassment&quot; to their Online Harassment Resources web page. However, due to the method of the list&#x27;s generation several IGDA members including the Chairman of IGDA Puerto Rico Roberto Rosario were added to the list of harassers. These errors resulted in the IGDA removing the link to the tool on 22 November.

<doc id="536148" wikidata="Q4825093" url="?curid=536148" title="Wardrobe malfunction">
<text>A wardrobe malfunction is a clothing failure that accidentally exposes a person&#x27;s intimate parts. It is different from deliberate incidents of indecent exposure or public flashing. Justin Timberlake first used the term when apologizing for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy during the 2004 Grammy Awards, saying that he accidentally revealed Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast instead of just her brassiere. The phrase &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; was in turn used by the media to refer to the incident and entered pop culture. There was a long history of such incidents before the term was coined and it has since become common.

==Etymology==
The American Dialect Society defines &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; as &quot;an unanticipated exposure of bodily parts&quot;. The term was also one of the new entrants into the &quot;Chambers Dictionary&quot; in 2008, along with words like &quot;electrosmog&quot;, &quot;carbon footprint&quot;, &quot;credit crunch&quot; and &quot;social networking&quot;. The dictionary defines it as &quot;the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered.&quot;

===Origins===
The term was first used on February 2, 2004, by singers Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson in a statement attempting to explain the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, during which Jackson&#x27;s right breast was exposed. Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was &quot;sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...&quot; The term &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; appeared in numerous stories in major US consumer and business publications, newspapers, and major TV and radio broadcasts. Journalist Eric Alterman described the incident as &quot;the most famous &#x27;wardrobe malfunction&#x27; since Lady Godiva.&quot;

===Related terms===
The American Dialect Society had a number of related terms for word of the year nominations in 2004, including &quot;Janet moment&quot; (&quot;unplanned bodily exposure at a public function&quot;), &quot;boobgate&quot; (&quot;scandal over Janet Jackson&#x27;s exposed breast&quot;), &quot;nipplegate&quot; (like boobgate, &quot;but used earlier in squawk over Jackson&#x27;s possible nipple ring&quot;), and &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; (&quot;overexposure in a mammary way&quot;). People came up with clever terms to describe an occurrence of &quot;accidental nudity&quot;, like &quot;nipple slip&quot; or &quot;nip slip&quot;. The term has been translated into other languages to describe similar incidents, including &#x27; (Dutch), &#x27; (French), &#x27; or (Italian), and &#x27; (Spanish).

==Instances==
In April 1957, Italian actress Sophia Loren was being welcomed to Hollywood by Paramount Pictures at a dinner party at Romanoff&#x27;s restaurant in Beverly Hills. American actress Jayne Mansfield arrived last and went directly to Loren&#x27;s table. Mansfield had previously engineered several stunts exposing her breasts. On this evening, she was seated between Loren and her dinner companion Clifton Webb. Braless and wearing a deeply plunging neckline, Mansfield at one point stood and purposefully leaned over the table, further exposing her breasts and her left nipple. Photographer Delmar Watson pictured Loren staring at Mansfield&#x27;s breasts, and Joe Shere also recorded the incident. Shere&#x27;s picture received international attention, and was published worldwide.

After Brigitte Bardot gained international fame in 1953 as the Bikini girl of the French Riviera, paparazzi popularized revealing accidents or staged events with women&#x27;s swimwear throughout the decade. For one of many instances, a cheesecake photo of rising starlet Daliah Lavi adjusting her bikini after it broke while at a Rio de Janeiro swimming pool was widely circulated by Associated Press in 1959.

On February 1, 2004, the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII was broadcast live from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network in the United States. During the show, Justin Timberlake mistakenly removed a portion of Janet Jackson&#x27;s costume, exposing for about half a second her breast adorned with a nipple shield. This was the first recorded usage of the term &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. The incident, sometimes referred to as Nipplegate, was news worldwide. MTV&#x27;s chief executive said that Jackson had planned the stunt and Timberlake was informed of it just moments before he took the stage. The stunt was broadcast live to a total audience of 143.6 million viewers.

In July 2012, when Australian model Miranda Kerr at one point leaned over to buckle her son into a car seat, she inadvertently revealed her thong to create a whale tail. The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; described this episode as a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;.

The Huffington Post was not the only outlet to describe such an incident as a wardrobe malfunction. In a November 2013 article describing a similar event where English model Abbey Clancy revealed a whale tail while lifting her daughter into a car, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; also described the event as a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;.

At the 2016 NFL draft combine, American football player Chris Jones ripped his compression shorts in the crotch during the 40-yard dash, and his genitals were seen live on television.

On August 16, 2023, during a livestream, American internet personality IShowSpeed jumped up from his seat while playing &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s: Security Breach&quot;, and accidentally flashed his penis to a live viewership of 25,000 people. He subsequently ended the livestream out of embarrassment. Viewers uploaded the clip onto social media, and the term &quot;IShowMeat&quot;, in reference to the slang word &quot;&quot;, meaning penis, began trending on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter).

<doc id="536158" wikidata="Q129021" url="?curid=536158" title="Opisthokont">
<text>The opisthokonts () are a broad group of eukaryotes, including both the animal and fungus kingdoms. The opisthokonts, previously called the &quot;Fungi/Metazoa group&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;urlFungi/Metazoa group&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; are generally recognized as a clade. Opisthokonts together with Apusomonadida and Breviata comprise the larger clade Obazoa.

==Flagella and other characteristics==

A common characteristic of opisthokonts is that flagellate cells, such as the sperm of most animals and the spores of the chytrid fungi, propel themselves with a single &quot;posterior&quot; flagellum. It is this feature that gives the group its name. In contrast, flagellate cells in other eukaryote groups propel themselves with one or more &quot;anterior&quot; flagella. Flagellate cells however have been secondarily lost in some opisthokont groups, including most of the fungi.

Opisthokont characteristics include synthesis of extracellular chitin in exoskeleton, cyst/spore wall, or cell wall of filamentous growth and hyphae; the extracellular digestion of substrates with osmotrophic absorption of nutrients; and other cell biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. Genera at the base of each clade are amoeboid and phagotrophic.

==History==
The close relationship between animals and fungi was suggested by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 1987, who used the informal name opisthokonta (the formal name has been used for the chytrids by Copeland in 1956), and was supported by later genetic studies.

Early phylogenies placed fungi near the plants and other groups that have mitochondria with flat cristae, but this character varies. More recently, it has been said that holozoa (animals) and holomycota (fungi) are much more closely related to each other than either is to plants, because opisthokonts have a triple fusion of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, dihydroorotase, and aspartate carbamoyltransferase that is not present in plants, and plants have a fusion of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase not present in the opisthokonts. Animals and fungi are also more closely related to amoebas than to plants, and plants are more closely related to the SAR supergroup of protists than to animals or fungi. Animals and fungi are both heterotrophs, unlike plants, and while fungi are sessile like plants, there are also sessile animals.

Cavalier-Smith and Stechmann argue that the uniciliate eukaryotes such as opisthokonts and Amoebozoa, collectively called unikonts, split off from the other biciliate eukaryotes, called bikonts, shortly after they evolved.

==Taxonomy==
Opisthokonts are divided into Holomycota or Nucletmycea (fungi and all organisms more closely related to fungi than to animals) and Holozoa (animals and all organisms more closely related to animals than to fungi); no opisthokonts basal to the Holomycota/Holozoa split have yet been identified. The Opisthokonts was largely resolved by Torriella et al. Holomycota and Holozoa are composed of the following groups.

* Holomycota (Fungus-like)
** Fungi
*** Includes:
**** chytrids (flagellated, zoosporic fungi)
**** &quot;Fonticula&quot; (more recent work considers this to be part of Cristidiscoidea, a sister group to the fungi)
**** &quot;Hyaloraphidium&quot; (previously thought to be a green alga, now considered a fungus)
**** microsporidia (previously thought to be apicomplexia)
**** Nucleariida (more recent work considers this to be part of Cristidiscoidea, a sister group to the fungi)
*** Excludes:
**** labyrinthulomycetes (slime nets) (now included in the SAR supergroup)
**** myxomycetes (now included in amoebozoans)
**** oomycetes (water molds) (now included in the SAR supergroup)
** Rozellida (placement uncertain)
* Holozoa (Animal-like)
** &quot;Corallochytrium&quot; (formerly considered a Heterokont)
** Filozoa
*** Animalia (including myxozoa)
*** Choanoflagellata (flagellates formerly included in protozoa)
*** Filasterea
** Mesomycetozoea
*** Amoebidiales (formerly considered trichomycetes)
*** Dermocystida (formerly considered parasitic fungi or sporozoans)
*** Eccrinales (formerly considered fungi)
*** Ichthyophonida (formerly considered parasitic fungi &quot;incertae sedis&quot;)

<doc id="536164" wikidata="Q7229424" url="?curid=536164" title="Poplar River (Montana–Saskatchewan)">
<text>Poplar River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long in Saskatchewan in Canada and Montana in the United States. The river is composed of three main forks – West, Middle, and East Poplar Rivers – that have their source in the Wood Mountain Hills of the Missouri Coteau. Along the river&#x27;s Middle Fork in Saskatchewan, there is a coal-fired power station. There are also dams built along the river&#x27;s forks.

Along with the Milk River and Big Muddy Creek, it is one of three waterways in Canada that drain into the Gulf of Mexico.

== Description ==
Poplar River and its main forks of West, Middle, and East Poplar Rivers begin in the Wood Mountain Hills in Saskatchewan. West Poplar River rises near Killdeer, Saskatchewan, and flows south-east, into north-eastern Montana, past Richland and across Daniels County. On the Saskatchewan side of the West Poplar River in the RM of Old Post No. 43, there is the West Poplar Dam (). It is high, was built in 1957, and is owned and operated by the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency. It impounds the Devils Lake reservoir. Poplar River (Middle fork) rises north-west of Rockglen, Saskatchewan, and flows south-east, into north-eastern Montana, and passes west of Scobey. The two forks unite in the northern part of Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The combined river flows south-east, then south-southwest, and joins the Missouri River near Poplar.

The East Poplar River begins south of Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan, and flows south out of the hills and meets the Poplar River in Montana, upstream from where the West Poplar River meets it. Along the course of the East Poplar River, on the Canadian side of the border, is Poplar River Power Station, which is a coal-fired station owned by SaskPower. Morrison Dam was built along the river in 1977 to provide cooling water for the station. Girard Creek, which originates at Fife Lake, and East Poplar River are the primary inflows for the Morrison Dam Reservoir.

== Variant names ==
The Poplar River has also been known as: Lost Child Creek and Middle Fork Poplar River.

<text>Stockard Channing (born Susan Antonia Williams Stockard; February 13, 1944) is an American actress. She played Betty Rizzo in the film &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and First Lady Abbey Bartlet in the NBC television series &quot;The West Wing&quot; (1999–2006). She also originated the role of Ouisa Kittredge in the stage and film versions of &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;; the 1993 film version earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. 

Channing won the 1985 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the Broadway revival of &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;, and won Emmy Awards for &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;The Matthew Shepard Story&quot;, both in 2002. She won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2004 for her role in &quot;Jack&quot;. Her film appearances include &quot;The Fortune&quot; (1975), &quot;The Big Bus&quot; (1976), &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), &quot;Heartburn&quot; (1986), &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; (1995), &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot; (1996), &quot;Practical Magic&quot; (1998), and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Anything Else&quot; (2003). She also played the recurring role of Veronica Loy on the CBS drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012–16).

==Early life and education==
Channing was born in Manhattan, and she grew up on the affluent Upper East Side. She was the daughter of Mary Alice (née English), who came from a large Brooklyn Irish Roman Catholic family, and Lester Napier Stockard (died 1960), who was in the shipping business. Her elder sister is Lesly Stockard Smith, former mayor of Palm Beach, Florida.

Channing is an alumna of the Madeira School in McLean, Virginia, a boarding school for girls, which she attended after starting at the Chapin School in New York City. She studied history and literature at Radcliffe College of Harvard University in Massachusetts and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1965. She received her acting training at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==

===Early career===
Channing started her acting career with the experimental Theatre Company of Boston; she performed in the group&#x27;s Off-Broadway 1969 production of the Elaine May play &quot;Adaptation/Next&quot;. She performed in a revival of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; directed by Theodore Mann as part of the Circle in the Square at Ford&#x27;s Theatre program in 1970. In 1971, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona — The Musical&quot;, working with playwright John Guare. She also appeared on Broadway in 1973 in a supporting role in &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot; at the Martin Beck Theatre.

Channing made her television debut on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the role of The Number Painter&#x27;s female victim. She landed her first leading role in the 1973 television movie &quot;The Girl Most Likely To...&quot;, a black comedy written by Joan Rivers about an ugly duckling woman, made newly beautiful by plastic surgery after an auto accident, who vows murderous revenge on all who had scorned her. For the role, Channing went through a considerable transformation, with the syndicated column &quot;TV Scout&quot; reporting months later, &quot;It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look so ugly. She had her cheeks puffed out with cotton and her nose was wadded, too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her look beautiful was easy.&quot; 

After some small parts in feature films, Channing co-starred with Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson in Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;The Fortune&quot; (1975). Despite Channing being tagged &quot;the next big thing&quot; in cinema, and the actress herself considering this some of the best work of her career, the movie did poorly at the box office and did not prove to be the breakthrough role Channing hoped it would be. On May 22, 1977, she, along with Ned Beatty, starred in the pilot for the short-lived TV series &quot;Lucan&quot;. Lucan, played by Kevin Brophy, is a 20-year-old who has spent the first 10 years of his life running wild in the forest. After being raised by wolves, Lucan strikes out on his own in search of his identity.

In 1977, at the age of 33, Channing was cast for the role of high school teenager Betty Rizzo in the hit musical &quot;Grease&quot;. The film was released in 1978 and her performance earned her the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Supporting Actress.

In addition, during the second half of the 1970s, Channing played a mischievous car thief in Jerry Schatzberg&#x27;s 1976 dramedy &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (which competed at the Cannes Film Festival), Joseph Bologna&#x27;s love interest in the disaster film spoof &quot;The Big Bus&quot; (also 1976), Peter Falk&#x27;s secretary in the 1978 Neil Simon film &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot;, and real-life deaf stuntwoman and former female land speed record holder Kitty O&#x27;Neil in the TV movie &quot;Silent Victory: The Kitty O&#x27;Neil Story&quot; (1979).

===1980s===
Channing starred in two short-lived sitcoms on CBS in 1979 and 1980: &quot;Just Friends&quot; and &quot;The Stockard Channing Show&quot;. In both shows, she co-starred with actress Sydney Goldsmith, who played her best friend in both. When her Hollywood career faltered after these failures, Channing returned to her theatre roots. Nevertheless, she continued to appear in movies, often in supporting roles, including 1983&#x27;s &quot;Without a Trace&quot; (alongside Kate Nelligan and Judd Hirsch), Mike Nichols&#x27; 1986 &quot;Heartburn&quot; (re-teaming with Nichols and Jack Nicholson, and co-starring Meryl Streep), &quot;The Men&#x27;s Club&quot; (also 1986; featuring Roy Scheider, Harvey Keitel, and Jennifer Jason Leigh), &quot;A Time of Destiny&quot; (1988; with William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, and Melissa Leo), and &quot;Staying Together&quot; (1989; directed by Lee Grant, and co-starring Melinda Dillon and Levon Helm.)

Channing played the female lead in the Broadway show, &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot; (1980–81). Channing then took the part of the mother (Sheila) in the 1981 Long Wharf Theater (New Haven) production of Peter Nichols&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;. She reprised the role in the Roundabout Theater Company production, first Off-Broadway in January 1985 and then on Broadway in March 1985, and won the 1985 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

Channing continued her return to the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; (1986) and &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play &quot;Woman in Mind&quot; received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing in the role of Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing&#x27;s most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they&#x27;re all fully realized because what you&#x27;re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but how much of it is on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.

Channing made her London theatre debut in 1992 at the Royal Court Theatre in John Guare&#x27;s Six Degrees of Separation, which then transferred for a season at the Comedy Theatre in the West End. In 2017 she returned to London to appear in Apologia at the Trafalgar Studios and again in 2021 in Night Mother at the Hampstead Theatre.

She also garnered recognition for her work in television during this time. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for the CBS miniseries &quot;Echoes in the Darkness&quot; (1987) and won a CableACE Award for the Harvey Fierstein-scripted &quot;Tidy Endings&quot; (HBO, 1988). Other TV movie credits during the latter half of the 1980s include the CBS teenage drug abuse-themed &quot;Not My Kid&quot; (1985; co-starring George Segal), Hallmark&#x27;s domestic drama &quot;The Room Upstairs&quot; (1987; with Sam Waterston, Joan Allen, and Sarah Jessica Parker), and the HBO thriller &quot;Perfect Witness&quot; (1989; alongside Brian Dennehy and Aidan Quinn.)

===1990s===
Channing reprised her lead role as an Upper East Side matron in the film version of &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;. She was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her performance. She then made several films in quick succession: &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; as Carol Ann and &quot;Smoke&quot; (both 1995); a cameo appearance in &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;; &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot; (as Marcia McGrath); and &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; (all 1996). For &quot;Smoke&quot; she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actress and for &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; she was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress, Drama.

Channing kept busy with film, television, and stage roles throughout the late 1990s. She starred in the USA Network film &quot;An Unexpected Family&quot; in 1996 and its sequel, &quot;An Unexpected Life&quot;, in 1998. She was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as Best Supporting Female for her performance as one-half of an infertile couple in &quot;The Baby Dance&quot; (also 1998). On stage, she performed at Lincoln Center in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Hapgood&quot; (1995) and the 1997 revival of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. During this period, Channing voiced Barbara Gordon in the animated series, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;.

Channing was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress three times in the 1990s: in 1991, for &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;; in 1992, for &quot;Four Baboons Adoring the Sun&quot;; and in 1999, for &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;.

===&quot;The West Wing&quot;===
In 1999, Channing took on the role of First Lady Abbey Bartlet in the NBC television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. She was a recurring guest star for the show&#x27;s first two seasons; she became a regular cast member in 2001. In the seventh and final season of &quot;The West Wing&quot; (2005–2006), Channing appeared in only four episodes (including the series finale) because she was co-starring (with Henry Winkler) in the CBS sitcom &quot;Out of Practice&quot; at the same time. &quot;Out of Practice&quot; was cancelled by CBS after one season.

===Later work===

Channing received several awards in 2002. She won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. That same year, she also won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress in a Television Movie or Miniseries for her portrayal of Judy Shepard in &quot;The Matthew Shepard Story&quot;, a docudrama about Matthew Shepard&#x27;s life and murder.

Channing received the 2002 London Film Critics Circle Award (ALFS) for Best Actress of the Year for her role in the film &quot;The Business of Strangers&quot;. For &quot;The Business of Strangers,&quot; she was also nominated for the American Film Institute Best Actress award. In 2003, she was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award.

In 2005, Channing won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children/Youth/Family Special for &quot;Jack&quot; (2004), a Showtime TV movie about a young man struggling to understand why his father left the family for another man. Channing played Jack&#x27;s mother.

She was selected for the second narrator of the Animal Planet hit series &quot;Meerkat Manor&quot; in 2008, replacing Sean Astin, who did the first three seasons. In November 2008, she returned to Broadway as Vera Simpson in the musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and was nominated for the 2009 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical.

In 2005, Channing starred in &quot;Out of Practice&quot; with Henry Winkler, receiving an Emmy nomination for her role. She played the role of Lydia Barnes, ex-wife of Stewart Barnes (Winkler), and had two sons and a lesbian daughter (Christopher Gorham, Paula Marshall, Ty Burrell). The show aired for one season (22 episodes).

From 2012, Channing played a recurring role in &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. She played the role of the title character&#x27;s mother, Veronica Loy until the final season in 2016.

She returned to the stage in June 2010, to Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre to play Lady Bracknell in Rough Magic Theatre Company&#x27;s production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. Channing appeared in the play &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot; Off-Broadway at Lincoln Center and then on Broadway, as of October 2011. Channing was nominated for the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actress in a Play, and the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot;. In 2018, she played the lead in &quot;Apologia&quot;, which had a limited run in London, and then moved to the Roundabout Theatre Co. in NYC.

Channing also narrated the audiobook, “Frankie &amp; Bug”, written by Gayle Forman, released in 2021

In May 2023, Channing appeared in ITV’s three part series “MaryLand” alongside Suranne Jones and Eve Best, playing a character named Cathy.

In 2025 she played Clytemnestra in Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Elektra&quot;, starring Brie Larson in the title role and directed by Daniel Fish. The play was performed in Brighton before moving to London in January.

<text>The Robie House (also the Frederick C. Robie House) is a historic house museum at 5757 South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago in Illinois, United States. Designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie style, it was completed in 1910 for the manufacturing executive Frederick Carlton Robie and his family. George Mann Niedecken oversaw the interior design, while associate architects Hermann von Holst and Marion Mahony also assisted with the design. The Robie House has been described as one of Wright&#x27;s best Prairie style buildings and was one of the last structures he designed at his studio in Oak Park, Illinois.

Robie purchased the land in May 1908, and construction began the next year. The Robie family lived in the house from May 1910 to December 1911; they sold the residence to the Taylor family, who lived there until November 1912. The Wilber family then lived at the Robie House until 1926, when the Chicago Theological Seminary bought it. The seminary used the house as a dormitory, meeting space, and classrooms, and it attempted to demolish the house in 1941 and 1957. Following an outcry over the second demolition attempt, the developer William Zeckendorf acquired the house in 1958. He donated it in early 1963 to the University of Chicago, which renovated the house. The Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, and later the university&#x27;s alumni association, subsequently occupied the Robie House. The National Trust for Historic Preservation leased the building in 1997, jointly operating it as a museum with the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. The mechanical systems and exterior was renovated in the early 2000s, followed by parts of the interior in the late 2000s and the 2010s.

The Robie House is a three-story, four-bedroom residence with an attached three-car garage. The house&#x27;s floor plan consists of two large, offset rectangles or &quot;vessels&quot;. The facade and perimeter walls are made largely of brick, with concrete trim, cut-stone decorations, and art glass windows. The massing includes several terraces, which are placed on different levels, in addition to roofs that are cantilevered outward. The house has around , which is generally split between communal spaces in the southern vessel and service rooms in the northern vessel. The first floor has a billiard room, playroom, and several utility rooms. The living room, dining room, kitchen, guest bedroom, and servants&#x27; quarters are on the second story, while three additional bedrooms occupy the third floor.

The Robie House was highly influential, having helped popularize design details such as picture windows, protruding roofs, and attached garages in residential architecture. The house has received extensive architectural commentary over the years, and it has been the subject of many media works, including books and museum exhibits. The Robie House is designated as a Chicago landmark and a National Historic Landmark, and it forms part of the &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;, a World Heritage Site.

== Site ==
The Robie House is located at 5757 South Woodlawn Avenue, on the northeast corner of Woodlawn Avenue and 58th Street in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago in Illinois, United States. The lot measures wide and long, the larger dimension extending west–east parallel to 58th Street. The house itself measures across. Due to an existing covenant on the site, the Robie House and the neighboring residences are set back from Woodlawn Avenue.

At the time of the Robie House&#x27;s construction, the block immediately to the south was vacant, and the nearest building to the south was away, across the Midway Plaisance park. Due to the flat topography of Chicago&#x27;s South Side, the site was also not particularly prominent. The houses to the north, along Woodlawn Avenue, were set back from the street and were above the sidewalk. These houses were largely made of brick. Although the Robie House&#x27;s architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, characterized the house as a &quot;city dwelling&quot;, it was more akin to a suburban house in a streetcar suburb full of single-family homes. To the west are the Rockefeller Chapel, the main Chicago Theological Seminary building, and the Oriental Institute. To the south is the University of Chicago Booth School of Business building designed by Rafael Viñoly.

== History ==
The house was commissioned for Frederick Carlton Robie (1879–1962), a manufacturing executive who, in the 1900s, worked at his father&#x27;s Excelsior Supply Company. Robie married Lora Hieronymus in 1902, and they moved to Hyde Park, Chicago, in 1904, relocating again within the same neighborhood in 1907. Concurrently, Robie wanted a residence that would incorporate the latest architectural innovations, rather than the old-fashioned details of conventional buildings. He had sketched tentative plans for a house of his own, showing them to several builders, who told him, &quot;You want one of those damn Wright houses.&quot; At the end of 1906, Robie and Wright discussed the house for the first time.

=== Development ===

==== Site acquisition and design ====
Robie decided to build his house at 5757 South Woodlawn Avenue, at the corner with 58th Street. This site was close to Lora&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Chicago, where she was still socially active. In April 1908, he agreed to obtain the site from the mining-machinery executive Herbert E. Goodman, on the condition that the site be used exclusively for residential purposes. Robie bought the site on May 19. As a condition of his purchase, he was required to spend at least $20,000 on a house there.

Robie hired Wright to design the house, saying that &quot;he was in my world&quot; when it came to the design. Robie recalled in 1958 that he had wanted a house illuminated by natural light, with uninterrupted living space, simple fixtures, and minimal bric-à-brac. He also wanted several bedrooms, a nursery, and an enclosed yard for his children, and he wanted to be able to see outward without having passersby look in. Robie eschewed older architectural styles such as the Cape Cod style, and he also did not want a monumental building or dark closets. In addition, he wanted a fireproof house, particularly one made of steel and concrete. The historian Joseph Connors wrote that Robie&#x27;s recollections may have been tainted because he had lived in the house and read Wright&#x27;s autobiography, while the historian Donald Hoffmann wrote that Robie came to adopt many aspects of Wright&#x27;s design philosophy as his own. According to Hoffmann, the house was to be &quot;radical and masculine&quot;, as Wright had designed the structure mainly around Robie&#x27;s needs, not those of his wife. Robie&#x27;s original budget had been $60,000, up to ten times the cost of a typical house at the time.

Wright designed the Robie House in his studio in Oak Park, Illinois; he was preoccupied with several other projects, so the design of Robie&#x27;s residence was not a particularly urgent matter. Wright first devised the plans for the Robie House mentally; unlike his contemporaries, Wright would focus on the building&#x27;s symmetry and proportions rather than on its exact dimensions. One night, he sat down with a blank sheet of paper and sketched three diagrams for the house. Wright paid so much attention to the house&#x27;s architectural details, he drew up blueprints just for the carpets. The original plans for the house may have been discarded or destroyed, but blueprints and renderings of the house remain extant. Robie signed the working drawings for his house in late March 1909, and construction began soon after.

==== Construction ====
H. B. Barnard Co. of Chicago was hired as the contractor. Robie recalled that the house did not need to use deep foundations and that the structural core—the chimney—was built rapidly. According to Robie, H. B. Barnard personally inspected the house&#x27;s brickwork every time laborers laid two or three courses of bricks. Robie&#x27;s son Frederick Jr. recalled playing with piles of sand (a material used in the mortar on the facade) and walking on the catwalks that contractors had set up. During construction, some of the brickwork had to be disassembled after stonemasons accidentally built five brick piers, rather than two piers and three bollards, underneath the house&#x27;s southern balcony.

Interior work continued through late 1909, and Wright left for Europe around that time. He hired the interior designer George Mann Niedecken to furnish the Robie House. Niedecken oversaw the interior decoration and the color scheme. Also involved in the project were the architect Hermann V. von Holst, as well as one of Wright&#x27;s draftswomen, Marion Mahony Griffin. By early 1910, the house was nearly complete. The furniture arrived in February, followed by curtains in March and carpets in April.

=== Use as residence ===
The house was used as a residence for less than 20 years. During this time, it was used by three families: the Robies, Taylors, and Wilbers. The Robie family—Frederick, Lora, and their two children, Frederick Jr. and Lorraine—moved into the home in May 1910, although interior decorations were not completed for several more months. Robie said in 1958 that the house had cost about $59,000; the land cost $14,000, the design and construction cost $35,000, and furnishings cost $10,000. This was far more than Wright&#x27;s studio in Oak Park, which cost $4,700 in 1889; the Winslow House, which cost $20,000 in 1892; or the Willits House, which cost $20,000 in 1903.

Despite the house&#x27;s high cost, the Robies owned the site for only two and a half years, and they lived in the house for just over a year. Frederick Robie&#x27;s father died soon after the family had moved in. Robie offered to pay his father&#x27;s debts, which reportedly totaled roughly $1 million. Lora Robie, who claimed that her husband had been unfaithful, moved out of the house in April 1911 and subsequently filed for divorce, which was finalized the next year. Frederick Robie moved to New York City, while Lora and their children moved to Springfield. Frederick Jr. later recalled that the family had taken just one bed when they moved out. When the elder Frederick declared bankruptcy in 1913, he reported having $25,672 in assets, nearly all of which consisted of a $25,000 mortgage loan that the Union Trust Company had placed on the house. Despite Robie&#x27;s personal issues, Wright would later call the residence &quot;a good house for a good man&quot;.

The Robies sold the house in December 1911 to David Lee Taylor, president of the advertising agency Taylor-Critchfield Company. The final sale price was approximately 20% less than the construction cost. David&#x27;s son Phillips, who was 10 years old when his father bought the house, recalled that he frequently ran half-mile laps between the living and dining rooms, although his siblings did not join him. David Taylor died in the house on October 22, 1912, less than a year after he bought the house. Taylor&#x27;s widow, Ellen Taylor, sold the house and most of its contents to Marshall Dodge Wilber, treasurer of the Wilber Mercantile Agency, that November. Marshall reportedly paid $45,000 for the house; he, his wife Isadora, and their two daughters lived nearby on Dorchester Avenue at the time. According to Phillips, the only objects his mother took with them were a lamp, a chair, and a humidor.

The Wilbers were the last family to occupy the house, moving in on December 3, 1912, and living there for fourteen years. The billiard room became a music room, and the living room became a parlor. The Wilbers employed a cook and a &quot;second girl&quot;, who lived on site, and a handyman, who came to the house every day. The Wilbers&#x27; residence sometimes hosted events, such as meetings of the Chicago Dramatic Society and the Quadranglers of the University of Chicago. Marshall also constructed a machine shop near the garage, while Isadora hired three men to restore the facade . The roof and three windows were replaced in 1916, and the Wilbers decorated the house with several photographs of their 25-year-old daughter Marcia after she died that year. The original coal-fired boiler was ineffective at warming the house during winter, so the Wilbers added an oil-fired furnace in 1919, replacing it in 1921. The Wilbers&#x27; surviving daughter, Jeannette, recalled that Wright often visited their house on short notice. By 1926, Jeannette had moved out. Marshall was in his sixties and wished to sell the house, as he was not in good health.

=== Chicago Theological Seminary ownership ===

==== 1920s to early 1950s ====
In June 1926, the Wilbers sold their Woodlawn Avenue residence to the Chicago Theological Seminary, whose campus was just to the south. The seminary paid $90,000 for the house and the furnishings, which remained largely intact, except for a bedspread that Isadora took as a souvenir. Originally, the residence was to be used as an administrative building until the seminary completed a new building. The seminary used the house as a dormitory, meeting space, and classrooms, though it wanted to redevelop the site in the long term. Seminary officials placed some of the furniture in storage. In addition, it sometimes gave tours of the Robie House. The architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the director of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), was among those who toured the house.

By 1941, the seminary was considering demolishing the house, which was then being used as a women&#x27;s dormitory. A graduate student at IIT inadvertently learned of the demolition plans and informed his instructors, including Mies. In response, writers such as Alexander Woollcott, Carl Sandburg, and Lewis Mumford, as well as architects such as Buckminster Fuller and Eliel Saarinen, protested the demolition. One of Wright&#x27;s apprentices, William F. Deknatel, led a committee to advocate for the house&#x27;s preservation. Ultimately, the plans were postponed due to World War II. In 1952, the seminary applied for a zoning variance to convert the first story into a dormitory. By that decade, the Robie House was being used for conferences, and much of its original decorations had been destroyed. At the time, the building was called the Conference House.

==== Redevelopment plans ====
The University of Chicago&#x27;s president Lawrence A. Kimpton was planning to redevelop the surrounding neighborhood. As part of this project, Holabird &amp; Root were hired to design a dormitory on the Robie House&#x27;s site. In response to a request from a local teacher, city alderman Leon Despres, who represented the neighborhood, introduced a resolution in the Chicago City Council to create a landmark commission. In March 1957, the seminary announced that it would replace the Robie House with a dormitory, which would have also involved demolishing the Goodman House and the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity house immediately to the north. The seminary planned to begin demolishing the house that September, saying it would have cost up to $100,000 to modernize the building. The seminary&#x27;s president Arthur Cushman McGiffert said that two institutions had declined an offer to take over the house and relocate it.

Architects, students, and artists shortly expressed opposition to the proposed demolition, as did Despres and Chicago&#x27;s mayor Richard J. Daley. The University of Fine Arts of Hamburg, the American Institute of Architects, and fellows at Wright&#x27;s Taliesin studio also opposed the demolition. Wright himself returned to the Robie House on March 18 to protest its demolition, saying, &quot;It all goes to show the danger of entrusting anything spiritual to the clergy.&quot; Wright claimed that the building was in relatively good condition, &quot;considering the abuse it has suffered&quot;, and that the kitchen was the only decrepit part of the house. He also claimed that he could repair the house for $15,000. McGiffert offered to move the house to Jackson Park or the Midway, but Wright dismissed the idea as inappropriate. Among other things, it would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to disassemble and rebuild the house elsewhere. Wright offered to design a dormitory for the seminary if the Robie House remained in place, but the seminary declined his offer. The Chicago government designated the house as a landmark in April 1957 and formed a committee of three men to preserve the house that July.

Meanwhile, the University of Chicago chapter of Phi Delta Theta, Wright&#x27;s old fraternity, offered to swap ownership of the Robie House and its own fraternity house at 5737 South Woodlawn Avenue, three houses north. The house&#x27;s demolition was postponed while the fraternity negotiated with the seminary. By October, the seminary had tentatively agreed to give the house to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation if the foundation raised $200,000. Phi Delta Theta and Zeta Beta Tau ultimately offered to donate their houses to the seminary. Julian Levi, who led the South East Chicago Commission, asked his friend William Zeckendorf, whose real-estate development firm Webb and Knapp was developing structures in Hyde Park, if he wanted to temporarily occupy the house. In December 1957, Zeckendorf offered to buy the Robie House for $125,000. To facilitate the house&#x27;s sale, in February 1958, the seminary applied for permission to rezone the lots immediately to the north. A City Council subcommittee recommended that August that the rezoning be approved. Aline B. Saarinen, architecture writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that the houser&#x27;s preservation &quot;was an uphill fight the whole way&quot;.

=== Zeckendorf and University of Chicago ownership ===

==== Acquisition and resale ====

Zeckendorf formally acquired the house in August 1958, paying $102,000, in exchange for allowing the seminary to approve any subsequent sales. He planned to occupy it for four years. Prior to taking over the house, he wanted to donate it to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and he suggested that the building could be converted to a library or museum. Immediately after buying the house, Zeckendorf announced that he would instead donate it to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Although the agreement between Zeckendorf and the seminary specified that the National Trust would take over the house, the National Trust agreed to give the house to the Wright Foundation. There were unofficial suggestions to turn the house into Chicago&#x27;s official mayoral residence or into an artists&#x27; studio.

Zeckendorf&#x27;s firm vacated the house in February 1962 after their Hyde Park developments were completed, and he wanted to donate the house to a &quot;responsible organization&quot; that could preserve it. The University of Chicago agreed to take over the house in June 1962, in exchange for giving the seminary a nearby plot of land. Two months later, preservationists formed a committee to raise $250,000 for the building&#x27;s restoration. William Hartmann of the architectural firm SOM said that structural repairs would cost $198,000, while the rest of the funds would be spend on furnishings. There were suggestions for the house to be converted into a residence for visiting scholars, for the university&#x27;s president, or classrooms for a department of the university. Another proposal called for the National Park Service to take over the house and operate it as a monument. Regardless of which option was selected, the university planned to allow visitors to tour the house. The university formally took title to the Robie House on February 4, 1963, and agreed to occupy the building and maintain it.

University officials immediately began raising money for the restoration; by then, the basement walls were leaking, the paint was peeling, and the wiring and mechanical systems were out of date. More than 100 architects and academics from around the world were appointed to the restoration committee. The university wanted to use the lower stories as a conference center, while the third floor bedrooms would be used by visiting scholars. Students from various universities began touring the house in April 1963, and the committee had collected about $31,000 by August. Among the donors to the house&#x27;s restoration were the Edgar J. Kaufmann Charitable Foundation and Edward Bok&#x27;s American Foundation. The Robie House&#x27;s fundraising committee spent $975 in late 1963 to repair damage caused by winter weather, and it had raised about $40,000 by early 1964. The fundraising committee continued to give tours of the house to raise money. Ira J. Bach, who led the committee, said the house needed additional funds, even as it received donations from around the world.

==== Usage ====

In February 1965, the Wright Foundation determined that the house could be restored for $109,000, rather than the originally planned $250,000. Taliesin Associated Architects, a firm composed of Wright&#x27;s former acolytes, was hired to design the renovation. Renovations began in mid-1965, after the University of Chicago had raised approximately $55,000. The house also began opening to the public on Saturdays, charging a $1 admission fee, proceeds from which would be used for the renovation. The first phase included weatherproofing, plumbing, heating, and roof upgrades. The house&#x27;s original contractor, H. B. Barnard Co., was hired to rebuild the roof, though the new roof was more vulnerable to water damage than the original. The plaster surfaces were also repainted, and the window frames were replaced. A second phase involved renovating the interiors, while the rest of the restoration was canceled due to a lack of funds. The house was still vacant by 1966, and the University of Chicago needed another $200,000. The same year, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a preservation program for historic buildings in Chicago, which would provide for the restoration of the Robie House.

In July 1966, Adlai Stevenson III announced that the newly-formed Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, a think tank devoted to left-wing causes, would be headquartered at the Robie House. The institute intended to convert part of the house into offices, and it would also host meetings and seminars there. The house had no structural issues, so the institute hired SOM to refurbish the house and add some furnishings. At ground level, the entrance hall became a reception room; the billiard room became a library, and the playroom became a seminar hall. The living room was converted to a lounge, the dining room retained its original function, and the second-floor guest rooms became a public relations office. The third-floor bedrooms also became offices. The Stevenson Institute moved into the building in February 1967, and the institute hosted its first party at the house in 1968. Though the house was poorly suited as a workplace for the institute&#x27;s 25 employees, the University of Chicago allowed the institute to stay there without paying rent. Some of the Robie House&#x27;s decorations were damaged in a burglary in 1970.

The Stevenson Institute formally merged with the University of Chicago in 1975, and the university continued to use the house&#x27;s meeting rooms. The institute also allowed the public to make appointments to tour the house. Subsequently, the university&#x27;s office of development used the house, followed by the university&#x27;s alumni association. By the 1980s, the Robie House served as the alumni association&#x27;s headquarters. At the time, a reporter described the house as being in poor shape, with cracked walls, peeling paint, and damaged decorations due to patchwork repairs. Meanwhile, the university spent only $15,000 annually on maintenance, and it did not even try to obtain funding from external sources. The house was filled with desks and cabinets. The university continued to host guided tours of the Robie House for a fee, though photography was not allowed at the time. In addition, the interior tours covered only two or three rooms.

=== Frank Lloyd Wright Trust use ===
As early as 1992, the University of Chicago was negotiating to have the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation (later the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust) take over the house&#x27;s operation. In February 1995, the University of Chicago announced that the building would be converted to a historic house museum. The university would spend $2.5 million on renovations and turn over operations to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. The National Trust for Historic Preservation agreed to lease the house in October 1996, and the university moved out during early 1997.

==== 1990s and 2000s ====

After taking over the house, the Wright Trust began hosting more frequent tours, and it opened a bookstore in the garage in August 1997. The Wright Trust planned to begin a 10-year-long renovation project in 2001, which was to cost $7 million. The bricks had cracked due to repeated freezing and thawing, and there were stains, termite infestations, and deteriorated porches. In addition, the roof was leaking, and the heating system was ineffective. This prompted the trust to create a master plan for the renovation. In 1999, workers removed asbestos from the site in preparation for the wider ranging renovation. The house received a $1 million grant for its restoration through the Pritzker Foundation and the federal Save America&#x27;s Treasures program. The Illinois government also provided $2 million through the Illinois First program, which covered the remainder of the first phase of the renovation.

A renovation of the Robie House commenced in 2002, though the house continued to host tours in the meantime. The conservation–restoration firm Gunny Harboe Architects oversaw the renovation. As part of the first phase, workers documented the art glass, mechanical systems, and climate in the house; added wheelchair-accessible restrooms; and created architectural drawings. Workers also fixed water damage, replaced the roof, and remedied the termite infestations. In addition, new mechanical systems and utilities were installed, and the facade and terraces were stabilized. The original brickwork manufacturer, Belden Brick, manufactured replacement bricks for the house. This work was completed in 2003. The third story remained closed to the public after the renovation, since it did not comply with Chicago fire-safety regulations.

The second phase, which involved renovating the interior, was delayed due to a lack of funds. Visitation, and by extension revenue, had declined after the September 11 attacks; at the time, the trust needed another $4 million for the interior. The trust sold engraved bricks to finance the renovations of the Robie House and Wright&#x27;s Oak Park studio. Work on the pantry and dining room began in 2006 or 2007, with an estimated cost of $3 million. During its renovation, the house continued to host tours and events. In 2009, the trust began allowing visitors to tour the third floor and servants&#x27; rooms, and it began allowing visitors to interact with artifacts from the house. By then, the house hosted 30,000 visitors annually. The trust wanted to reproduce or build replicas of the original decorations and fixtures.

==== 2010s to present ====
The Frank Lloyd Wright Trust continued to raise funding for the house&#x27;s renovation. In 2014, the house received a grant through the Getty Foundation&#x27;s Keeping It Modern initiative; the $50,000 grant was used to develop a preservation plan. By then, the trust had already raised $2 million of a projected $6 million renovation budget. The same year, the house became part of Museum Campus South, a group of museums in Hyde Park. An interior restoration began in late 2017, covering the first and second stories. The interior restoration focused on the interior elements, such as woodwork, glass, and furniture. Workers restored original design elements such as millwork and sconces, and the project involved repainting the house to its original colors and repairing the original front door. The Frank Lloyd Wright Trust borrowed some of the house&#x27;s original furniture from the Smart Museum of Art.

The restoration was completed in March 2019, having cost $3.5 million. In total, the renovation project had cost over $11 million. Tours of the house were suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois. The house reopened that June, though tour groups were initially restricted to eight people.

== Architecture ==

The Robie House (also known as the Frederick C. Robie House) is designed in the Prairie style. Wright wanted the architecture, art, and furnishings to have a consistent design; and he aspired for the house to be a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, an ideal work of art. Though many components of the Robie House were symmetrical or nearly so, the house as a whole is asymmetrical. The author Joseph Connors writes that Wright&#x27;s use of symmetrical details had been inspired by the teachings of Friedrich Fröbel and the École des Beaux-Arts. The design shares elements with Wright&#x27;s F. F. Tomek House in Riverside, Illinois, and his Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York. Connors cites the Yahara Boat Club in Madison, Wisconsin, and the River Forest Tennis Club in River Forest, Illinois, as additional forerunners to the Robie House.

In designing the Robie House, Wright largely avoided the cruciform and pinwheel plans that he had used in previous houses. The house still uses a variation of a pinwheel plan, albeit one in which the west–east axis is more heavily emphasized than the north–south axis. The house&#x27;s floor plan consists of two large rectangles, or &quot;vessels&quot;, offset from one another. Each vessel is about one-half the site&#x27;s length. The southern, primary vessel extends west and contains communal spaces, which terminate in prow-shaped bays to the west and east. The northern, secondary vessel extends east and contains service rooms, such as the kitchen and entrance hall.

=== Exterior ===
Unlike similar houses, which had roofs supported by load-bearing walls, the Robie House&#x27;s roofs are cantilevered outward from the house&#x27;s core. The exterior walls are treated as curtain walls or non-structural screens. In addition, Wright wanted people to view the house primarily from its southwest corner, where 58th Street and Woodlawn Avenue intersect. In contrast to his contemporaries, who prioritized exterior design over interior design, Wright believed that the facade&#x27;s design should be subordinate to the house&#x27;s interior function.

Because the site was flat and significantly longer on one side, Wright designed the house as a long, low building, similarly to other Prairie style buildings. As such, even though the house is three stories tall, the massing gives the impression of a single-story house with a small attic. The strong horizontal emphasis of the design was atypical of contemporary homes, which generally emphasized their vertical details. According to Wright, the low-to-the-ground design was intended to give the house a &quot;more intimate relation with outdoor environment and far-reaching vistas&quot;. As it was not possible for Wright to add a garden, the house is instead decorated with urns and planters. The primary rooms on the second story are raised; this provided privacy, as it allowed views outward while preventing passersby from looking in. The house is set back from Woodlawn Avenue, but the main roof and one perimeter wall extend past the western elevation of the facade, reducing the visual effect of the setback.

==== Facade ====

The house sits on a water table made of concrete, while the facade is made largely of brick. The house also uses concrete for balconies; cut stone for window sills and copings; and a wood frame for the third story. According to Frederick Robie Jr., Wright ordered custom-made bricks for the house, which measure across. The low, narrow bricks in the facade are laid horizontally. The bricks are colored violet, red, and orange with scattered dark spots. Wright emphasized the horizontal axis further by deepening the horizontal joints between each row of bricks, while filling in the vertical joints. The horizontal joints were infilled with mortar in the mid-20th century. The water table and cut-stone sills and copings were also oriented horizontally, further emphasizing the fact that the house was low to the ground. The northern facade is a plain brick wall. An L-shaped chimney rises from the center of the house; it is topped by a brick closet leading to a rooftop balcony.

Wright incorporated horizontal bands of windows into the facade. These windows are made of art glass to blur the distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces and to illuminate the rooms. In contrast to double-hung windows, which consist of sliding window panes stacked above each other, Wright used casement windows, which are side-by-side and can swing outward. There are 175 art glass panels throughout the house, arranged in 29 patterns. These panels have intricate, vertically oriented geometric motifs.

The main entrance leads to the first floor and is recessed significantly from the western facade on Woodlawn Avenue. The entrance courtyard has a floor made of red tiles. A staircase leads up to a porch hanging off the western side of the second floor. There are three additional entrances to the house from the eastern driveway, which lead to the first-floor playroom, the first-floor laundry and furnace room, and the second-floor kitchen. An ornamental gate was originally installed outside the driveway. A brick perimeter wall runs along the northern and eastern boundaries of the site. The wall originally was about one story high; the top of the wall was shortened in the 1960s to provide bricks for the construction of a storage room near the garage.

The house&#x27;s attached garage can fit three cars. The attached garage was a novelty when the house was built; at the time, cars were considered especially vulnerable to catching fire, so houses generally had detached garages. To visually separate the garage and the rest of the house, Wright added a gap to the roof, and he added posts and lintels beneath the rooftop gap. The garage functions as a bookstore for the museum.

==== Terraces and roofs ====
The massing includes several terraces on different levels. The largest such terrace is a balcony on the south side of the second floor, which has a brick parapet. It measures long and is accessed by a row of 12 French doors. The southern balcony is supported by several metal beams, which are concealed beneath a stone coping and are flanked by brick columns. During construction, Wright added a pit at each end of the balcony, and the French doors next to these pits were converted to windows. Under the balcony are two full-height brick piers, alternating with three half-height brick bollards. There is another balcony to the northwest, a porch to the west, and several smaller porches hanging off the building. The western porch measures wide and is cantilevered off the western facade.

The house is topped by several hip roofs, which have shallow pitches and are made of red Ludowici tile. The roofs have projecting eaves, emphasizing the horizontal orientation of the facade, and there are upturned bronze gutters. Above the second floor, a shallow eave allows light to be reflected off the second-story terrace into the living and dining rooms. There is a deeper eave above the third-story bedrooms.

=== Interior ===

The house has around , with four bedrooms, six bathrooms, eleven closets, and a servants&#x27; quarters. In contrast to contemporary residences, the Robie House has several open plan spaces, and it lacks side rooms such as a reading room and a women&#x27;s lounge, Wright used low ceilings throughout the house, juxtaposing them with high ceilings for esthetic effect. The superstructure is made of horizontal steel beams and brick piers. Steel is used extensively, including under the terraces and in the living-room ceiling, the latter of which uses bolted-steel beams thick. The house had a central lighting system, which was operated from three control panels. There were also a central vacuum system, burglar and fire alarms, a valve to water all the planters, and a heating and air-cooling system. Radiators for the heating and cooling system are concealed in cabinets, and there are also four fireplaces.

Originally, the rooms were decorated in a cream, brown, ocher, and salmon color scheme. Rougher-textured paint was used in bedrooms, while smoother paint was used in the communal areas. The house was originally illuminated by 30 sconces designed by Wright, of which only two remained in the 1960s. Wright designed two types of sconces: oak and brass fixtures for the bedrooms and other private spaces, and frosted-glass fixtures for communal spaces. The house includes eight Japanese–inspired oak screens, which served as partitions; each screen consists of square bars measuring thick. To provide privacy, some of the windows have roller shades. Lora Robie&#x27;s closet includes built-in hooks, since clothes hangers had not been invented when the Robie House was built.

==== First story ====
In contrast to the light-filled upper stories, the first story is a dark space with low ceilings. From the main entrance on Woodlawn Avenue, visitors had to follow a circuitous path to access the rest of the house. The entrance foyer is on the first (ground) floor of the northern vessel and has a plaque on its east wall. The billiard room and playroom are to the south of the foyer; a coat closet and a stair to the second-floor kitchen are to the east; and a bathroom is to the north. The coat-closet doorway and the foyer&#x27;s southern doorway both have movable oak screens. There is also a window alcove on the north wall, next to a radiator with three windows.

The billiard room was originally at the west end of the southern vessel, while the playroom occupied the east end. The windowless western wall of the billiard room, which exists mostly to support the living room above it, could be used as storage space or as a wine cellar. The billiard room&#x27;s northern wall has clerestory windows with lozenge motifs. On the southern wall is a small garden and a concrete terrace. The billiard room is separated from the playroom by a stairway leading to the second floor. Within the playroom, there is a cantilevered bench within an inglenook, as well as a prow-shaped niche to the east. The billiard room and playroom both have individual fireplaces. Subsequent owners used wood-and-plasterboard partitions to divide the playroom and billiard room into six rooms.

The Robie House has a partial cellar with a boiler plant. The house does not have a full cellar because the site was originally swampland and because Wright did not want to excavate the &quot;damp sticky clay of the prairie&quot;. The boiler plant, consisting of a coal room and furnace room, is only four steps below ground. It is located at the west end of the house&#x27;s northern vessel, along with the coat room, laundry, and workshop. At the east end of the northern vessel&#x27;s first story is the garage. There were maintenance pits in the garage, but these were filled in when the garage was converted into offices in the mid-20th century. The garage and the other service rooms could be accessed only from the outside.

==== Second story ====

In designing the second floor, Wright sought to eliminate &quot;boxes beside or inside other boxes&quot; by blurring the boundaries between the rooms. The rooms were still distinguished from each other by the use of different cabinetry and carpet designs. The stairway from the center of the first floor leads to an intermediate hall on the second floor, between the northern and southern vessels. The stair hall is separated from the southern vessel by a screen made of wooden slats. Movable portières, or curtains, hang above the doorways in the stair hall. In addition, the stair hall has a bookcase on its northern wall, and a doorway leads northwest to the guest bedroom&#x27;s balcony.

The living and dining rooms in the southern vessel have similar design features and are separated only by a fireplace. Their ceilings vary in height, dividing both rooms into three bays from north to south. The outer bays have ceilings, while the central bay has ceilings. Wooden boards, which are designed to resemble ceiling beams, span the ceiling&#x27;s width. The spaces are illuminated both by recessed lights above the outer bays (which are hidden behind grilles), as well as spherical lamps. There is also a chimney flue and ventilation openings near the ceiling, in addition to two steel beams that support the roof. The house&#x27;s south balcony extends from the living and dining rooms, and both rooms have decorative wooden screens as well.The living room occupies the western part of the southern vessel. The prow on the living room&#x27;s west wall serves as a niche and has windows and doors with multicolored glass. The north wall of the living room has five casement windows, while the western section of the south wall has a narrow sidelight and casement window. The carpet is decorated with a rose rectangle and a dozen green squares. The fireplace between the living and dining rooms has narrow brick piers and a fieldstone mantel. The fireplace serves a mostly ceremonial function, since the house is heated by concealed radiators. The dining room is east of the living room; its east wall has a breakfast nook within a bay window. The north wall of the dining room has a wooden sideboard, complementing the French doors on the opposite wall.

The northern vessel includes servants&#x27; quarters, a kitchen, and a guest room. The guest bedroom, at the western end, has a carpet with rotated squares and vessel motifs. The guest room&#x27;s bathroom has frosted-glass windows, and a balcony next to the guest bedroom overhangs the entrance court. A stairway separates the guest room from the kitchen, which is located at the center of the northern vessel. The kitchen has a plain design with casement windows and some wood and glass decorations. At the east end of the northern vessel, there are three servants&#x27; rooms, above the garage. These consist of two bedrooms for maids, in addition to a servants&#x27; dining room. The servant bedrooms have flower boxes, intricate casement windows, and sloped ceilings.

==== Third story ====

A stairwell leads from the second story to the third story, which Wright described as a &quot;belvedere&quot;. The third floor is T-shaped in plan, with the stem of the T being above the northern vessel; the floor plan vaguely resembles a Greek cross with asymmetrical arms. The third story abuts the chimney to its west and visually connects the vessels below it. It has three bedrooms, each of which overlooks a balcony with planters and urns. The master bedroom occupies the southern end of the T. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet, a master bathroom, a dressing room with built-in drawers, and a fireplace. Another bedroom at the northwest corner overlooks Woodlawn Avenue and has a closet and glass decorations. The smallest bedroom in the house is at the northeast corner, whose windows mostly face eastward. In all three bedrooms, there are small casement windows for flower boxes.

==== Furniture ====
Wright designed many pieces of the house&#x27;s original furniture. George Niedecken built much of the furniture, which was made of oak. In the foyer, there were objects such as oak furniture and patterned carpets. The foyer&#x27;s oak furniture, which included a cantilevered table, a geometrically patterned table scarf, and chairs, was intended to complement the design. The living room&#x27;s original furniture included a sofa with extended armrests. The living room also included a bench with side tables; a smoker&#x27;s cabinet; a small study with a desk and lamp; and movable chairs. The dining chairs had high seatbacks to give the dining table a more intimate feel, thereby creating a &quot;room within a room&quot;. The rectangular dining table was expandable and had table scarves. There were lampposts at each of the dining table&#x27;s corners, which were intended to draw diners&#x27; focus toward the center of the table, discouraging side conversations. The house also had an imported Austrian carpet. For the guestroom, Wright designed a dresser, a double bed, and side chairs. Wright did not design the third-story furniture, which included wardrobes and built-in drawers.

When the house was converted into the Stevenson Institute&#x27;s headquarters in the 1960s, some contemporary furniture designed by SOM was added to the house, including upholstered chairs. The house&#x27;s original sofa was reproduced at that time. By then, the house was decorated in a plum, dark red, brown, and saffron gold color palette. Some pieces of furniture were upholstered in silk, wool, or mohair, while other furnishings (primarily seating) were covered with natural leather.

Some of Wright&#x27;s original furniture is in the collection of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Smart Museum of Art. The Smart Museum also owns disassembled pieces of furniture from the Robie House, pieces from other Wright houses, and pieces not designed by Wright. In 2019, the Smart Museum lent the dining chairs and table to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. The original sofa, also in the Smart Museum&#x27;s collection, has been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1982. When the house was being considered for demolition, some of the art glass windows were moved to a police station at the University of Chicago. Replicas of the Robie House&#x27;s dining room chairs, the lamps, the sconces, and the cantilevered living-room couch have also been sold. A lamp from the house was auctioned off for $704,000 in 1988, making it the most expensive Wright–designed furnishing ever sold at the time.

== Management ==

The University of Chicago owns the house, leasing it to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which jointly operates the museum with the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. The Wright Trust hosts guided tours of the house, which are hosted five days a week and last 45 to 60 minutes each. There are also audio tours of the house. The third floor is excluded from most of the house&#x27;s tours but is part of the &quot;Private Spaces&quot; tour. The Robie House is part of the annual &quot;Wright Plus&quot; walking tour, which includes visits to several buildings designed by Wright. Since 2018, the Robie House has been part of the Frank Lloyd Wright Trail, a collection of 13 buildings designed by Wright in Illinois.

The trust typically hosts training courses for volunteer tour guides twice annually. Over the years, the trust has trained several grade-school students as tour guides. In addition, the trust rents out the house for events.

=== Reception ===
When the Robie House was built, local residents disliked how the building stood out from its surroundings. The house was viewed more positively in the architecture community, though its historic significance was not widely recognized until the 1930s. After its demolition was proposed in 1957, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; described the house as &quot;one of the most important works of one of the world&#x27;s most influential architects&quot;, calling the proposed demolition a &quot;needless tragedy&quot;. Another commentator called the Robie House &quot;for many Americans the finest work of art turned out by any of our architects in our history as a nation.&quot; The Swiss architect Werner M. Moser said that Europeans regarded the Robie House &quot;as a monument of historic value&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said in 1965 that a visit to the house&#x27;s living room was comparable to seeing a Giotto painting or hearing a Ludwig van Beethoven symphony for the first time.

A critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said in 1984 that &quot;the strength and vitality that turned so many heads in 1909 still shine brightly.&quot; The same year, Donald Hoffman said that the house &quot;embraced so many opposite tendencies&quot;; for instance, the house&#x27;s attic contrasted with its low-lying form, and its closed-off exteriors stood in contrast to the openness of the interiors. Robert Campbell of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the Robie House &quot;probably the greatest the master [Wright] ever did&quot;, along with Fallingwater in Greater Pittsburgh. The &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; wrote that &quot;the essential integrity of the design, inside and out, is intact and engrossing&quot;. The writer Neil Levine said that the Robie House felt &quot;buoyant and spacious&quot; despite its low-lying massing, and a writer for &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; said the house was representative of the &quot;energy and optimism&quot; that characterized the early 20th century.

The house has been the subject of various comparisons. A writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the Robie House as &quot;a sheet cake that wants to be a ziggurat&quot;. Other sources called the building a &quot;quintessential Prairie School house&quot; and one of his best Prairie style structures. Writers have also likened the building&#x27;s low massing to a ship, and it was described as an example of &quot;Dampfer architecture&quot;, in reference to the German word for &quot;steamship&quot;. Another source described the house as the &quot;culmination&quot; of Wright&#x27;s early work.

=== Architectural influence ===
The Robie House was one of the first residences in the U.S. to be made of cement blocks and poured concrete. A writer for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said that some of the house&#x27;s design features had since become commonplace, including cantilevered slabs, concrete floors, and corner windows. The house&#x27;s continuous windows and protruding roof were also popularized nationwide. Newspapers have cited the house as having introduced other architectural details, such as spare bathrooms, self-watering planters, attached garages, picture windows, and split-level spaces. Some of the house&#x27;s architectural features had been used in Wright&#x27;s previous designs, such as Warren McArthur&#x27;s house and Wright&#x27;s Oak Park studio. The Robie House was one of the most prominent buildings that Wright designed in his Oak Park studio, as well as one of the last structures he designed there.

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks said: &quot;The bold interplay of horizontal planes about the chimney mass, and the structurally expressive piers and windows, established a new form of domestic design.&quot; A 1957 article in &quot;House &amp; Home&quot; magazine said that &quot;The house introduced so many concepts in planning and construction that its full influence cannot be measured accurately for many years to come&quot;, calling it the most consequential house to be built in the U.S. in a century. Similarly, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; said in 1962 that the Robie House was Wright&#x27;s first residence to &quot;have an effective influence on modern residential architecture&quot;, and Walter Gropius called the house &quot;a milestone in independent architecture&quot;.

In contrast to the Robie House, Wright&#x27;s later designs (with exceptions such as Fallingwater) were not designed with a diagonal vantage point in mind. Nonetheless, some architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe did design buildings that were intended to be viewed from an angle. The Robie House&#x27;s other architectural features inspired architects in Europe, starting with the Dutch architect J. J. P. Oud, who in 1918 was the first to publish an article about the house. These features influenced the design of European structures such as Mies&#x27;s Barcelona Pavilion and the Rietveld Schröder House. In turn, American architects began using these design features in the 1930s. Specific structures influenced by the Robie House include a residence in Franklin Park, Pennsylvania; the Domino&#x27;s Pizza headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan; and a residence on Navajo Avenue in Edgebrook, Chicago. Decorations from the house, such as the sconces, have also been replicated.

The Robie House was listed as &quot;one of the seven most notable residences ever built in America&quot; in a 1956 &quot;Architectural Record&quot; article. A 1976 poll of American-architecture experts ranked the Robie House among the top structures in the U.S., while a 1982 poll of &quot;&quot; readers ranked the Robie House as the country&#x27;s third-best building. In 1991, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) named the house among the Top All-Time Work of American Architects. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Robie House was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by AIA&#x27;s Illinois chapter.

=== Landmark designations ===
Chicago&#x27;s Commission on Architectural Landmarks designated the Robie House as a landmark in 1957, in an attempt to stave off the building&#x27;s demolition. The house was also the first 20th-century building that the National Trust for Historic Preservation tried to preserve. The AIA&#x27;s Chicago chapter gave the building&#x27;s owners a plaque in 1960, recognizing the building as a landmark. After the Commission on Chicago Landmarks replaced the Commission on Architectural Landmarks in 1968, the Robie House was again nominated for city-landmark designation in early 1971. At the landmark commission&#x27;s recommendation, a Chicago City Council committee approved the designation that August. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks&#x27; designation applied only to the exterior and prevented unauthorized alterations.

When the house was being considered for demolition in 1957, the National Park Service initially refused to consider preserving the house, as it was not yet 50 years old. The Robie House was ultimately designated as Chicago&#x27;s first National Historic Landmark in July 1963, and a plaque affirming this designation was dedicated in April 1964. The house was also added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, the day the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 went into effect. The Robie House is a contributing property to the Hyde Park–Kenwood Historic District, designated in 1979, and the house was further designated as an Illinois Historic Landmark in 1980.

The United States Department of the Interior nominated the Robie House and nine other Wright–designed buildings to the World Heritage List in 2015; the buildings had previously been nominated in 2008. UNESCO added eight properties, including the Robie House, to the World Heritage List in July 2019 under the title &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.

=== Media and exhibits ===

The Robie House was detailed in Ernst Wasmuth&#x27;s 1910 &quot;Wasmuth Portfolio&quot;. The Historic American Buildings Survey cataloged the building&#x27;s architectural details and floor plans in the 1960s, and Donald Hoffmann wrote a book about the house in 1984&quot;.&quot; In addition, presentations from a 1984 symposium at the house were published in the book &quot;The Nature of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;. An animated tour of the house was released on CD-ROM in 1995, and the house was depicted in a stamp issued by the United States Postal Service in 1998. The house has been the subject of several documentary films, including a 1975 BBC documentary, a 2004 episode of HGTV&#x27;s &quot;Restore America: A Salute to Preservation&quot; series, and the 2013 PBS documentary and companion book &quot;10 Buildings that Changed America&quot;.

Several exhibits have featured the Robie House. For example, models of the house were displayed at the Cincinnati Art Museum in 1933 and at the Exhibition of American Art in Paris during 1938. The house was also featured in several exhibits at New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1941, 1961, and 1994, and a model of the house was displayed at MoMA in 1964. Furniture from the house was displayed at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Smart Museum of Art in 1979. and at the National Gallery of Art, while chairs from the house was displayed at New York&#x27;s Cooper Hewitt Museum in 1983 and at the Boston Design Center in 1992. The Chicago Athenaeum organized an exhibit about the Robie House and Wright&#x27;s other Chicago designs in 1992.

The house has been depicted in other creative works as well. For instance, the graphic designer Steven Brower cut a pizza box into the shape of the Robie House. Edmund V. Gillon Jr. released a model of the house in 1998, and a rendering of the house was also included in a 2002 pop-up book about Wright&#x27;s work. Lego started selling a model of the Robie House in 2011. In addition, Blue Balliett&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;The Wright 3&quot; was set in the house.

<doc id="536181" wikidata="Q912748" url="?curid=536181" title="Shtora-1">
<text>Shtora-1 (, &quot;curtain&quot;) is an electro-optical active protection system or suite for tanks, designed to disrupt the laser designator and laser rangefinders of incoming anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The system is mounted on the Russian T-80 and T-90 series tanks and the Ukrainian T-84. The existence of &quot;Shtora&quot; was revealed in 1980 by spy Adolf Tolkachev.

==Description==
Shtora-1 is an electro-optical jammer that disrupts semiautomatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) ATGMs, laser rangefinders and target designators. Shtora-1 is a soft kill countermeasure system. The system was shown fitted to a Russian main battle tank during the International Defense Exposition, held in Abu Dhabi in 1995. The first known application of the system is the Russian T-90 main battle tank, which entered service in the Russian Army in 1993. It is also available on the BMP-3M infantry fighting vehicle.

==Components==

The Shtora-1 has four key components: two electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) &quot;dazzlers&quot; mounted on both turret cheeks, an infrared jammer, a modulator, and a control panel in the fighting compartment.

* Banks of forward firing grenade launchers on each side of the turret that lay an aerosol smoke screen opaque to IR light.
* A laser warning system consisting of four angle sensors with two higher precision sensors covering the frontal 90° arc and two lower precision sensors covering the sides and rear.
* A control system comprising control panel, microprocessor, and manual screen-laying panel. This processes the information from the sensors and activates the aerosol screen-laying system.
* Two IR lights, one on each side of the main gun, continuously emit coded pulsed-IR jamming when an incoming ATGM has been detected.

Shtora-1 has twelve smoke grenade launchers and weighs 400 kg. It can lay a 15 meter high and 20 meter wide smoke screen in three seconds that lasts about twenty seconds at ranges from 50 to 70 meters. The Shtora-1 can also automatically slew the main gun towards a detected threat, so that the tank crew can return fire and so that the stronger frontal turret armour is facing it.

Shtora-1 can operate in fully automatic or semi-automatic modes, continuously for six hours against ATGM attack.

==Operational history==
The Shtora-1 is claimed to be effective at jamming obsolete SACLOS missiles such as the TOW, HOT, MILAN, Dragon, and Malyutka and laser guided weapons such as the Copperhead and some variants of the Maverick and Hellfire. Newer missiles such as the TOW 2 (which encodes the tracking beacon signals to reject interference) and imaging infrared guided missiles such as the Javelin are unaffected by it. This has resulted in a number of Shtora-1 protected T-90s being lost to such weapons in Syria and Ukraine. The jammers have been removed from many currently serving T-90s and the more modern S and M variants did not include them.

==Specifications==
* Laser illumination sensors:
** 2x TShU-1-1 coarse precision sensors and 2x TShU-1-11 fine sensors
** Field of view (each): 138° azimuth (coarse) 45° (fine) and −5 to +25° elevation 
** Field of view (total): 360° azimuth
** Angular resolution: 7.5° (coarse) 3.75° (fine)
* EO interference emitters:
** 2x OTShU-1-7
** Operating band: 0.7-2.7 μm
** Protected sector: 4° elevation and 20° azimuth
** Energy consumption: 1 kW
** Light intensity: 20 mcd
* IR smoke grenades:
** 12x 81 mm 3D17
** Obscured band: 0.4-14 μm
** Bloom time: 3 s
** Cloud persistence: 20 s

Growing to about total length, the cardinal tetra has the striking iridescent blue line characteristic of the genus &quot;Paracheirodon&quot; laterally bisecting the fish, with the body below this line being vivid red in color, hence the name &quot;cardinal tetra&quot;. The cardinal tetra&#x27;s appearance is similar to that of the closely related neon tetra, with which it is often confused; the neon&#x27;s red coloration extends only about halfway to the nose, and the neon&#x27;s blue stripe is a less vibrant blue.

The cardinal tetra is a very popular aquarium fish, but is less widespread than the neon tetra because until recently, it was difficult to breed in captivity. However, many breeders are now producing the fish; in most cases, one can determine if the cardinal tetra is bred or wild-caught due to damaged fins on wild-caught specimens. Some ichthyologists believe fishkeepers should continue to support the sustainable cardinal fishery of the Amazon Basin, since thousands of people are employed in the region to capture fish for the aquarium trade. If those fishermen lost their livelihoods catching cardinals and other tropical fish, they might turn their attention to engaging in deforestation.

==Taxonomy==
American ichthyologist Leonard Peter Schultz described the cardinal tetra in 1956 as &quot;Cheirodon axelrodi&quot;. The specific epithet honors ichthyologist Herbert R. Axelrod. &quot;Hyphessobrycon cardinalis&quot; is an obsolete synonym. The fish&#x27;s common name, cardinal tetra, refers to the brilliant red coloration, reminiscent of a cardinal&#x27;s robes. &quot;P. axelrodi&quot; is also often called the red neon tetra.

The species exists in a number of different color forms or phenotypes. A &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;silver-blonde&quot; form exists in the Rio Negro drainage that has less blue in the longitudinal stripe. The normal form from the Rio Negro drainage has a blue stripe, which extends to the adipose fin, while the Orinoco drainage phenotype has a stripe that stops posterior to the adipose. The Orinoco phenotype may represent a subspecies of &quot;P. axelrodi&quot;.

==Description==
The cardinal tetra has bright red ventral parts and an iridescent blue line that runs horizontally along its body. The characteristic iridescence of this and related fishes, such as the neon tetra, is a structural color, caused by refraction of light within guanine crystals that develop within special cells called iridocytes in the subcutaneous layer. The exact shade of blue seen depends on the viewing angle of the viewer relative to the fish - if the viewpoint changes so as to look at the fish more from below, the colour will change hue, becoming more deeply sapphire blue and even indigo. Change of viewpoint to one above the fishes, however, and the color becomes more greenish. Cardinal tetras appear to grow larger in captivity than they do in the wild. They have a large stomach and small gut.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cardinal tetras are found in the upper Orinoco of Colombia and Venezuela, as well as the upper Rio Negro of Brazil.

==Ecology and behavior==
===Diet===
The cardinal tetra forages in areas of slow-moving, shallow water. It is predominantly predatory, feeding on tiny animals found on underwater plants, roots, and leaf litter. Creatures commonly eaten include the larvae of chironomid midges and microcrustaceans such as water fleas (Cladocera) of the families Moinidae, Macrotrichidae, and Daphniidae, and copepods of the family Harpacticidae. Other organisms eaten include other fly larvae, insect eggs, rotifers, and testate amoebae.

===Reproduction===
In the wild, the cardinal tetra swims upstream in large numbers to parts of its native river habitat completely enclosed above by rainforest canopy. Such waters are subject to heavy shading by the rainforest trees, and virtually no sunlight reaches them. Here, the fishes spawn in large aggregations. If the fishes are ready to spawn, the male pursues the female into fine-leaved plants; her fuller outline, which usually indicates the presence of ripe eggs within her reproductive tract, should be readily apparent at this point. If the female is ready, she allows the male to swim alongside her, and together, the pair release eggs and sperm.

===Lifespan===
The fish might also be effectively an annual species with a lifespan of just a single year in nature. It lives for several years in captivity. For those seeking to breed them in the aquarium, the best way to do so is by mimicking the same natural setup. A study conducted in Manaus, Brazil, subjected cardinal tetras to adverse water conditions for 96 hours. The fish perished at a low temperature of and a high of , and pH below 2.9 or above 8.8.

==In the aquarium trade==

An entire industry is in place in Barcelos on the banks of Brazil&#x27;s Rio Negro in which the local population catches fish for the aquarium trade. The cardinal fishery here is highly valued by the local people who act as stewards for the environment. The local people may not become involved in potentially environmentally damaging activities, such as deforestation, because they can make a sustainable living from the fishery. 

Between the years of 2006 to 2015, over 92,000,000 cardinal tetras were exported from the state of Amazonas, accounting for 64.57% of all ornamental fish exports from the state during this time.

<text>Surfers’ Choice is the debut studio album of Dick Dale and his Del-Tones, pioneers in the surf genre. The album was released in November 1962. The recording established the conventions of surf music and brought the concept to middle America. The album was mostly recorded live at the Rendezvous Ballroom, with overdubs added in the studio. The record was out of print for a long time. It was reissued on CD by Sundazed Music in October 2006. The album was rereleased by Not Now Music with a bonus disc of singles as &quot;Surf Beat&quot;.

<doc id="536188" wikidata="Q272737" url="?curid=536188" title="Phenology">
<text>Phenology is the study of periodic events in biological life cycles and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors (such as elevation).

Examples include the date of emergence of leaves and flowers, the first flight of butterflies, the first appearance of migratory birds, the date of leaf colouring and fall in deciduous trees, the dates of egg-laying of birds and amphibia, or the timing of the developmental cycles of temperate-zone honey bee colonies. In the scientific literature on ecology, the term is used more generally to indicate the time frame for any seasonal biological phenomena, including the dates of last appearance (e.g., the seasonal phenology of a species may be from April through September).

Because many such phenomena are very sensitive to small variations in climate, especially to temperature, phenological records can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, especially in the study of climate change and global warming. For example, viticultural records of grape harvests in Europe have been used to reconstruct a record of summer growing season temperatures going back more than 500 years.
In addition to providing a longer historical baseline than instrumental measurements, phenological observations provide high temporal resolution of ongoing changes related to global warming.

== Etymology ==
The word is derived from the Greek (&quot;phainō&quot;), &quot;to show, to bring to light, make to appear&quot; + (&quot;logos&quot;), amongst others &quot;study, discourse, reasoning&quot; and indicates that phenology has been principally concerned with the dates of first occurrence of biological events in their annual cycle.

The term was first used by Charles François Antoine Morren, a professor of botany at the University of Liège (Belgium). Morren was a student of Adolphe Quetelet. Quetelet made plant phenological observations at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels. He is considered &quot;one of 19th century trendsetters in these matters.&quot; In 1839, he started his first observations and created a network over Belgium and Europe that reached a total of about 80 stations in the period 1840–1870.

Morren participated in 1842 and 1843 in Quetelets &#x27;Observations of Periodical Phenomena&#x27; (Observations des Phénomènes périodiques), and at first suggested to mention the observations concerning botanical phenomena &quot;anthochronological observations&quot;. That term had already been used in 1840 by Carl Joseph Kreutzer.

On 16 December 1849, Morren used the term &#x27;phenology&#x27; for the first time in a public lecture at the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, to describe &quot;the specific science which has the goal to know the manifestation of life ruled by the time.&quot;

Four years later, Morren published &quot;Phenological Memories&quot;.
The term may not have been common in the decades to follow, as in an article in &quot;The Zoologist&quot; of 1899 describing an ornithological meeting in Sarajevo, where &quot;questions of Phaenology&quot; were discussed, a footnote by the Editor, William Lucas Distant, says: &quot;This word is seldom used, and we have been informed by a very high authority that it may be defined as &quot;Observational Biology&quot;, and as applied to birds, as it is here, may be taken to mean the study or science of observations on the appearance of birds&quot;.

==Records==

===Historical===

Observations of phenological events have provided indications of the progress of the natural calendar since ancient agricultural times. Many cultures have traditional phenological proverbs and sayings which indicate a time for action: &quot;When the sloe tree is white as a sheet, sow your barley whether it be dry or wet&quot; or attempt to forecast future climate: &quot;If oak&#x27;s before ash, you&#x27;re in for a splash. If ash before oak, you&#x27;re in for a soak&quot;. But the indications can be pretty unreliable, as an alternative version of the rhyme shows: &quot;If the oak is out before the ash, &#x27;Twill be a summer of wet and splash; If the ash is out before the oak, &#x27;Twill be a summer of fire and smoke.&quot; Theoretically, though, these are not mutually exclusive, as one forecasts immediate conditions and one forecasts future conditions.

The North American Bird Phenology Program at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) is in possession of a collection of millions of bird arrival and departure date records for over 870 species across North America, dating between 1880 and 1970. This program, originally started by Wells W. Cooke, involved over 3,000 observers including many notable naturalists of the time. The program ran for 90 years and came to a close in 1970 when other programs starting up at PWRC took precedence. The program was again started in 2009 to digitize the collection of records and now with the help of citizens worldwide, each record is being transcribed into a database which will be publicly accessible for use.

The English naturalists Gilbert White and William Markwick reported the seasonal events of more than 400 plant and animal species, Gilbert White in Selborne, Hampshire and William Markwick in Battle, Sussex over a 25-year period between 1768 and 1793. The data, reported in White&#x27;s &quot;Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot; are reported as the earliest and latest dates for each event over 25 years; so annual changes cannot therefore be determined.

In Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Such historical records may, in principle, be capable of providing estimates of climate at dates before instrumental records became available. For example, records of the harvest dates of the pinot noir grape in Burgundy have been used in an attempt to reconstruct spring–summer temperatures from 1370 to 2003; the reconstructed values during 1787–2000 have a correlation with Paris instrumental data of about 0.75.

===Modern===
====Great Britain====

Robert Marsham, the founding father of modern phenological recording, was a wealthy landowner who kept systematic records of &quot;Indications of spring&quot; on his estate at Stratton Strawless, Norfolk, from 1736. These took the form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Generations of Marsham&#x27;s family maintained consistent records of the same events or &quot;phenophases&quot; over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years. Between 1850 and 1950 a long-term trend of gradual climate warming is observable, and during this same period the Marsham record of oak-leafing dates tended to become earlier.

After 1960 the rate of warming accelerated, and this is mirrored by increasing earliness of oak leafing, recorded in the data collected by Jean Combes in Surrey. Over the past 250 years, the first leafing date of oak appears to have advanced by about 8 days, corresponding to overall warming on the order of 1.5 °C in the same period.

Towards the end of the 19th century the recording of the appearance and development of plants and animals became a national pastime, and between 1891 and 1948 the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS) organised a programme of phenological recording across the British Isles. Up to 600 observers submitted returns in some years, with numbers averaging a few hundred. During this period 11 main plant phenophases were consistently recorded over the 58 years from 1891 to 1948, and a further 14 phenophases were recorded for the 20 years between 1929 and 1948. The returns were summarised each year in the Quarterly Journal of the RMS as &quot;The Phenological Reports&quot;. Jeffree (1960) summarised the 58 years of data, which show that flowering dates could be as many as 21 days early and as many as 34 days late, with extreme earliness greatest in summer-flowering species, and extreme lateness in spring-flowering species. In all 25 species, the timings of all phenological events are significantly related to temperature, indicating that phenological events are likely to get earlier as climate warms.

&quot;The Phenological Reports&quot; ended suddenly in 1948 after 58 years, and Britain remained without a national recording scheme for almost 50 years, just at a time when climate change was becoming evident. During this period, individual dedicated observers made important contributions. The naturalist and author Richard Fitter recorded the First Flowering Date (FFD) of 557 species of British flowering plants in Oxfordshire between about 1954 and 1990. Writing in &quot;Science&quot; in 2002, Richard Fitter and his son Alistair Fitter found that &quot;the average FFD of 385 British plant species has advanced by 4.5 days during the past decade compared with the previous four decades.&quot; They note that FFD is sensitive to temperature, as is generally agreed, that &quot;150 to 200 species may be flowering on average 15 days earlier in Britain now than in the very recent past&quot; and that these earlier FFDs will have &quot;profound ecosystem and evolutionary consequences&quot;. In Scotland, David Grisenthwaite meticulously recorded the dates he mowed his lawn since 1984. His first cut of the year was 13 days earlier in 2004 than in 1984, and his last cut was 17 days later, providing evidence for an earlier onset of spring and a warmer climate in general.

National recording was resumed by Tim Sparks in 1998 and, from 2000, has been led by citizen science project Nature&#x27;s Calendar , run by the Woodland Trust and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Latest research shows that oak bud burst has advanced more than 11 days since the 19th century and that resident and migrant birds are unable to keep up with this change.

====Continental Europe====
In Europe, phenological networks are operated in several countries, e.g. Germany&#x27;s national meteorological service operates a very dense network with approx. 1200 observers, the majority of them on a voluntary basis. The Pan European Phenology (PEP) project is a database that collects phenological data from European countries. Currently 32 European meteorological services and project partners from across Europe have joined and supplied data.

In Geneva, Switzerland, the opening of the first leaf of an official chestnut tree (a horse chestnut) has been observed and recorded since 1818, thus forming the oldest set of records of phenological events in Switzerland. This task is conducted by the secretary of the Grand Council of Geneva (the local parliament), and the opening of the first leaf is announced publicly as indicating the beginning of the Spring. Data show a trend during the 20th century towards an opening that happens earlier and earlier.

====Other countries====

There is a USA National Phenology Network in which both professional scientists and lay recorders participate.

Many other countries such as Canada (Alberta Plantwatch and Saskatchewan PlantWatch), China and Australia
also have phenological programs.

In eastern North America, almanacs are traditionally used by farmers for information on action phenology (in agriculture), taking into account the astronomical positions at the time.
William Felker has studied phenology in Ohio, US, since 1973 and now publishes &quot;Poor Will&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, a phenological almanac for farmers (not to be confused with a late 18th-century almanac by the same name).

In the Amazon rainforests of South America, the timing of leaf production and abscission has been linked to rhythms in gross primary production at several sites. Early in their lifespan, leaves reach a peak in their capacity for photosynthesis, and in tropical evergreen forests of some regions of the Amazon basin (particularly regions with long dry seasons), many trees produce more young leaves in the dry season, seasonally increasing the photosynthetic capacity of the forest.

==Airborne sensors==
Recent technological advances in studying the earth from space have resulted in a new field of phenological research that is concerned with observing the phenology of whole ecosystems and stands of vegetation on a global scale using proxy approaches. These methods complement the traditional phenological methods which recorded the first occurrences of individual species and phenophases.

The most successful of these approaches is based on tracking the temporal change of a Vegetation Index (like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI)). NDVI makes use of the vegetation&#x27;s typical low reflection in the red (red energy is mostly absorbed by growing plants for Photosynthesis) and strong reflection in the Near Infrared (Infrared energy is mostly reflected by plants due to their cellular structure). Due to its robustness and simplicity, NDVI has become one of the most popular remote sensing based products. Typically, a vegetation index is constructed in such a way that the attenuated reflected sunlight energy (1% to 30% of incident sunlight) is amplified by ratio-ing red and NIR following this equation:
: formula_1

The evolution of the vegetation index through time, depicted by the graph above, exhibits a strong correlation with the typical green vegetation growth stages (emergence, vigor/growth, maturity, and harvest/senescence). These temporal curves are analyzed to extract useful parameters about the vegetation growing season (start of season, end of season, length of growing season, etc.). Other growing season parameters could potentially be extracted, and global maps of any of these growing season parameters could then be constructed and used in all sorts of climatic change studies.

A noteworthy example of the use of remote sensing based phenology is the work of Ranga Myneni from Boston University. This work showed an apparent increase in vegetation productivity that most likely resulted from the increase in temperature and lengthening of the growing season in the boreal forest. Another example based on the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) reported by Alfredo Huete at the University of Arizona and colleagues showed that the Amazon Rainforest, as opposed to the long-held view of a monotonous growing season or growth only during the wet rainy season, does in fact exhibit growth spurts during the dry season.

However, these phenological parameters are only an approximation of the true biological growth stages. This is mainly due to the limitation of current space-based remote sensing, especially the spatial resolution, and the nature of vegetation index. A pixel in an image does not contain a pure target (like a tree, a shrub, etc.) but contains a mixture of whatever intersected the sensor&#x27;s field of view.

== Phenological mismatch ==

Most species, including both plants and animals, interact with one another within ecosystems and habitats, known as biological interactions. These interactions (whether it be plant-plant, animal-animal, predator-prey or plant-animal interactions) can be vital to the success and survival of populations and therefore species.

Many species experience changes in life cycle development, migration or in some other process/behavior at different times in the season than previous patterns depict due to warming temperatures. Phenological mismatches, where interacting species change the timing of regularly repeated phases in their life cycles at different rates, creates a mismatch in interaction timing and therefore negatively harming the interaction. Mismatches can occur in many different biological interactions, including between species in one trophic level (&quot;intratrophic&quot; interactions) (i.e. plant-plant), between different trophic levels (&quot;intertrophic&quot; interactions) (i.e. plant-animal) or through creating competition (&quot;intraguild&quot; interactions). For example, if a plant species blooms its flowers earlier than previous years, but the pollinators that feed on and pollinate this flower do not arrive or grow earlier as well, then a phenological mismatch has occurred. This results in the plant population declining as there are no pollinators to aid in their reproductive success. Another example includes the interaction between plant species, where the presence of one species aids in the pollination of another through attraction of pollinators. However, if these plant species develop at mismatched times, this interaction will be negatively affected and therefore the plant species that relies on the other will be harmed.

Phenological mismatches means the loss of many biological interactions and therefore ecosystem functions are also at risk of being negatively affected or lost all together. Phenological mismatches will effect species and ecosystems food webs, reproduction success, resource availability, population and community dynamics in future generations, and therefore evolutionary processes and overall biodiversity.

<text>A can opener (North American and Australian English) or tin opener (British English) is a mechanical device used to open metal tin cans. Although preservation of food using tin cans had been practiced since at least 1772 in the Netherlands, the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States. These early openers were basically variations of a knife, though the 1855 design continues to be produced.

The can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating cutting wheel that runs round the can&#x27;s rim to cut open the lid was invented in 1870, but was considered very difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer. A more successful design came out in 1925 when a second, serrated wheel was added to hold the cutting wheel on the rim of the can. This easy-to-use design has become one of the most popular can opener models.

Around the time of World War II, several can openers were developed for military use, such as the American P-38 and P-51. These featured a robust and compact design with a pull cutting blade hinged to a corrugated handle with a pivot. Electric can openers were introduced in the late 1950s and met with success. The development of new can opener types continues with a recent redesign of a side-cutting model.

== Invention of cans ==

Food preserved in tin cans was in use by the Dutch Navy from at least 1772. Before 1800, there was already a small industry of canned salmon in the Netherlands. Freshly caught salmon were cleaned, boiled in brine, smoked and placed in tin-plated iron boxes. This canned salmon was known outside the Netherlands, and in 1797 a British company supplied one of their clients with 13 cans. Preservation of food in tin cans was patented by Peter Durand in 1810. The patent was acquired in 1812 by Bryan Donkin, who soon set up the world&#x27;s first canning factory in London in 1813.

By 1820, canned food was a recognised article in Britain and France and by 1822 in the United States. The first cans were robust containers, which weighed more than the food they contained and required ingenuity to open, using whatever tools available. The instruction on those cans read &quot;Cut round the top near the outer edge with a chisel and hammer.&quot; The gap of decades between the invention of the can and can opener may be attributed to the functionality of existing tools versus the cost and effort of a new tool.

== Twist-key can-opener ==


Also called tin can key can-opener. During the 1800s, the canning process was mechanised and refined, with can walls becoming thinner. The twist-key can-opener was patented by J. Osterhoudt in 1866. There still was no general-purpose can-opener, thus each can came with a spot-welded or soldered-on twist-key can-opener which snapped off after fatiguing the metal by bending at a thin region. Each food-type had its own can-type, and came with its own can-opener-type. Tinned fish and meat were sold in rectangular cans. These cans were fitted with a twist-key that would roll around the top of the can, peeling back a pre-scored strip. Coffee, beans, and most other types of meat were packaged in cylinders with metal strips that could be peeled back with their own kinds of built-in keys that would roll around the top of the can. Cans of milk used puncture devices.
== Lever-type can openers ==

General-purpose can openers first appeared in the 1850s and had a primitive claw-shaped or &quot;lever-type&quot; design. In 1855, Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised the first claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans.

In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut, US. It consisted of a sharp sickle, which was pushed into the can and sawed around its edge. A guard kept the sickle from penetrating too far into the can. The opener consisted of several parts which could be replaced if worn out, especially the sickle. This opener was adopted by the United States Army during the American Civil War (1861–1865); however, its unprotected knife-like sickle was too dangerous for domestic use. A home-use opener named the &quot;Bull&#x27;s head opener&quot; was designed in 1865 and was supplied with cans of pickled beef named &quot;Bully beef&quot;. The opener was made of cast iron and had a very similar construction to the Yeates opener, but featured a more artistic shape and was the first move towards improving the look of the can opener. The bull-headed design was produced until the 1930s and was also offered with a fish-head shape.

== Rotating wheel can openers ==
The first rotating wheel can opener was patented in July 1870 by William Lyman of Meriden, Connecticut, US and produced by the firm Baumgarten in the 1890s. The can was to be pierced in its centre with the sharp metal rod of the opener. Then, the length of the lever had to be adjusted to fit the can size, and the lever fixed with the wingnut. The top of the can was cut by pressing the cutting wheel into the can near the edge and rotating it along the can&#x27;s rim.

The necessity to pierce the can first was a nuisance, and this can opener design did not survive. In 1920, Edwin Anderson patented a can opener with pivoted handles with which to hold the can in one hand while a key-type handle geared to a cutting wheel is turned with the other cutting the outside of the lip, a side can opener, unlike the gramophone-like orientation of most contemporary can openers, in effect a hand-held pliers version of the Swanson Can-Opener. In 1925, the Star Can Opener Company of San Francisco, California, US had improved Lyman&#x27;s design by adding a second, serrated wheel, called a &quot;feed wheel&quot;, which allowed a firm grip of the can edge. This addition was so efficient that the design is still in use today.

Whereas all previous openers required using one hand or other means to hold the can, can-holding openers simultaneously grip the can and open it. The first such opener was patented in 1931 by the Bunker Clancey Company of Kansas City, Missouri and was, therefore, called the &quot;Bunker&quot;. It featured the now standard pliers-type handles, when squeezed would tightly grip the can rim, while turning the key would rotate the cutting wheel, progressively cutting the lid along the rim. The cutting wheel is coupled to a serrated feed wheel as in the Star design and rotated in the opposite direction by interlocking cogwheels reducing friction. The Bunker company was absorbed by the Rival Manufacturing Company, also of Kansas City, in 1938.
A new style of the can opener emerged in the 1980s. Whereas most other openers remove the lid by cutting down through the lid from the top just inside the rim, removing the top and leaving the rim attached to the can, these use a roller and cutting wheel to cut through the outside seam of the can. The can is left with a relatively safe, non-jagged edge, and the top can be set back on top as a cover, although it does not provide a seal. The feed wheel teeth have a somewhat finer pitch than those of earlier designs and reside at the bottom of a V-shaped groove, which surrounds the rim on three sides at the point of action.
== Church key ==

Church key initially referred to a simple hand-operated device for prying the cap (called a &quot;crown cork&quot; or &quot;bottle cap&quot;) off a glass bottle; this kind of closure was invented in 1892. The first of these church key style openers was patented in Canada in 1900.

The shape and design of some of these early &quot;church key&quot; opener&#x27;s fulcrum hole resembled a large old key&#x27;s dual-node keyring hole. In 1935, steel beer cans with flat tops appeared, and a device to pierce the lids was needed. The same opener was used for piercing those cans. Made from a single piece of pressed metal, with a sharp point at one end, it was devised by D. F. Sampson, for the American Can Company, who depicted operating instructions on the cans. The church key opener is still being produced, sometimes as part of another opener. For example, a &quot;butterfly&quot; opener is often a combination of the church key and a serrated-wheel opener. Beer and soda cans began in the mid-1960s to feature pop-tabs, which were rings attached to cans. These tabs eliminated the need for church keys to open the cans.

== Military use can openers ==

First Pocket and militar opener was the revolutionary pocket can opener, advertised as being for explorers, &quot;Explorador español&quot;, manufactured in Spain in 1906, designed by D. José Valle Armesto, which would become the first pocket can opener, due to its lightness and versatility, as it allowed, in addition to opening cans, to do the same with bottle caps or act as a screwdriver.

Several can openers with a simple and robust design have been specifically developed for military use. The P-38 and P-51 are small can openers with a cutter hinged to the main body. They were also known as a &quot;John Wayne&quot; because the actor was shown in a training film opening a can of K-rations. The P-38 can opener is keychain-sized, about 1.5 inches (38 mm) long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle (and can also be used as a screwdriver), with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid. A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is &quot;walked&quot; around the rim to cut the lid out. A larger version, called P-51, is somewhat easier to operate. P-38 was developed in 1942 and was issued in the canned field rations of the United States Armed Forces from World War II to the 1980s. The P-38 and P-51 are cheaper to manufacture and are smaller and lighter to carry than most other can openers. The device can be easily attached to a keyring or dog tag chain using the small punched hole.

Official military designations for the P-38 include &quot;US Army pocket can opener&quot; and &quot;Opener, can, hand, folding, type I&quot;. As with some other military terms (e.g., &quot;jeep&quot;), the origin of the term is not known with certainty. The P-38 and P-51 openers share a designation with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and North American P-51 Mustang fighters, however this is coincidental. The most likely origin of the name is much more pedestrian; the P-38 and P-51 measure and in length respectively.

P-38s are no longer used for individual rations by the United States Armed Forces, as canned C-rations were replaced by soft-pack MREs in the 1980s. They are, however, included with United States military &quot;Tray Rations&quot; (canned bulk meals). They are also still seen in disaster recovery efforts and have been handed out alongside canned food by rescue organizations, both in America and abroad in Afghanistan. The original US-contract P-38 can openers were manufactured by J. W. Speaker Corp. (stamped &quot;US Speaker&quot;) and by Washburn Corp. (marked &quot;US Androck&quot;), they were later made by Mallin Hardware (now defunct) of Shelby, Ohio and were variously stamped &quot;US Mallin Shelby O.&quot; or &quot;U.S. Shelby Co.&quot;
A similar device that incorporates a small spoon at one end and a bottle opener at the other is currently employed by the Australian Defence Force and New Zealand Army in its ration kits. The Field Ration Eating Device is known by the acronym &quot;FRED&quot;. It is also known as the &quot;Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device&quot;.

Another similar device was included with British Army &quot;Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose&quot; 24-hour ration pack and &quot;Composite Ration Pack&quot; rations. At one time they were manufactured by W. P. Warren Engineering Co., Ltd. The instructions printed on the miniature, greaseproof paper bag in which they were packed read: &quot;Their design is similar, but not identical, to the P-38 and P-51 can openers.&quot;

Most military ration can openers have a very simple design and have also been produced for civilian use in many countries. For example, small folding openers similar to the P-38 and P-51 were designed in 1924 and were widely distributed in the Eastern European countries.

In Slovenia a somewhat rounded version of a P-38 is known as &quot;sardine can opener&quot;, because in the 1990s such openers were usually packed with cans that did not feature the pull-top pre-scored lid. A non-folding version of the P-38 used to be very common in Israeli kitchens, and can still be found in stores, often sold in packs of five.

== Electric openers ==

The first electric can opener was patented in 1931 and modeled after the rotating wheel can opener design. Those openers were produced in the 1930s and advertised as capable of removing lids from more than 20 cans per minute without risk of injury. Nevertheless, they found little success. Electric openers were re-introduced in 1956 by two American companies. Klassen Enterprises of Centreville brought out a wall-mounted electric model, but this complex design was unpopular too.
The same year, Walter Hess Bodle invented a freestanding device, combining an electric can opener and knife sharpener. He and his family members built their prototype in his garage, with daughter Elizabeth sculpting the body design. It was manufactured under the &quot;Udico&quot; brand of the Union Die Casting Co. in Los Angeles, California, US and was offered in Flamingo Pink, Avocado Green, and Aqua Blue, popular colors of the era. These openers were introduced to the market for Christmas sales and found immediate success.

<text>Muriel Rukeyser (December 15, 1913 – February 12, 1980) was an American poet, essayist, biographer, novelist, screenwriter and political activist. She wrote across genres and forms, addressing issues related to racial, gender and class justice, war and war crimes, Jewish culture and diaspora, American history, politics, and culture. Kenneth Rexroth said that she was the greatest poet of her &quot;exact generation,&quot; Anne Sexton famously described her as &quot;mother of us all&quot;, while Adrienne Rich wrote that she was “our twentieth-century Coleridge; our Neruda.&quot;

One of her most powerful pieces was the long poem titled &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; (1938), documenting the details of the Hawk&#x27;s Nest incident, an industrial disaster in which hundreds of miners died of silicosis.

Her poem &quot;To be a Jew in the Twentieth Century&quot; (1944), on the theme of Judaism as a gift, was adopted by the American Reform and Reconstructionist movements for their prayer books, something Rukeyser said &quot;astonished&quot; her, as she had remained distant from Judaism throughout her early life.

==Early life==
Muriel Rukeyser was born on December 15, 1913, to Lawrence and Myra Lyons Rukeyser. She attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, a private school in The Bronx, then Vassar College in Poughkeepsie. From 1930 to 1932, she attended Columbia University.

Her literary career began in 1935 when her book of poetry &quot;Theory of Flight&quot;, based on flying lessons she took, was chosen by the American poet Stephen Vincent Benét for publication in the &quot;Yale Younger Poets Series&quot;.

==Activism and writing==
Rukeyser was active in progressive politics throughout her life. At age 21, she covered the Scottsboro case in Alabama, then worked for the International Labor Defense, which handled the defendants&#x27; appeals. She wrote for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and a variety of publications, including &quot;Decision&quot; and &quot;Life &amp; Letters Today&quot;, for which she was supposed to cover the People&#x27;s Olympiad (Olimpiada Popular, Barcelona), the Catalan government&#x27;s alternative to the Nazis&#x27; 1936 Berlin Olympics. Instead of reporting on the games, she witnessed the first days of the Spanish Civil War, an experiences that she would describe as a &quot;moment of proof,&quot; forming the basis of her rediscovered autobiographical novel, &quot;Savage Coast&quot;, and the long poem &quot;Mediterranean&quot;. Rukeyser famously traveled to Gauley Bridge, West Virginia with the filmmaker and photographer Nancy Naumburg, to investigate the recurring silicosis among miners there, which resulted in her modernist masterpiece the documentary poem &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; (poem). During and after World War II she gave a series of lectures, entitled &quot;The Usable Truth&quot;, about art and politics in times of crisis, eventually published, in 1949. as &quot;The Life of Poetry&quot;. From the end of the war through the period of McCarthyism, she was the target of sexist literary and political attacks which affected her career trajectory and publishing opportunities, and the FBI compiled a thick file on her as a suspected Communist. For much of her life, she taught university classes and led writing workshops, but she never became a career academic.

In 1996, Paris Press reissued &quot;The Life of Poetry&quot;, which was published in 1949 but had fallen out of print. In a publisher&#x27;s note, Jan Freeman called it a book that &quot;ranks among the most essential works of twentieth century literature.&quot; In it Rukeyser makes the case that poetry is essential to democracy, essential to human life and understanding.

In the 1960s and 1970s, when Rukeyser presided over PEN America, her feminism and opposition to the Vietnam War drew a new generation to her poetry. The title poem of her final book, &quot;The Gates&quot;, is based on her unsuccessful attempt to visit Korean poet Kim Chi-Ha on death row in South Korea. In 1968, she signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In addition to her poetry, she wrote a fictionalized memoir, &quot;The Orgy&quot;, plays, among them the musical &quot;Houdini&quot;, and screenplays. She also translated work by Octavio Paz and Gunnar Ekelöf. She wrote biographies of Josiah Willard Gibbs, Wendell Willkie, and Thomas Hariot. Andrea Dworkin worked as her secretary in the early 1970s. Also in the 1970s she served on the Advisory Board of the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective, a New York City based theatre group that wrote and produced plays on feminist issues.

Rukeyser died in New York on February 12, 1980, from a stroke, with diabetes as a contributing factor. She was 66.

==In other media==
In the television show &quot;Supernatural&quot;, Metatron the angel quotes an excerpt of Rukeyser&#x27;s poem &quot;Speed of Darkness&quot;: &quot;The Universe is made of stories, not of atoms.&quot;
Jeanette Winterson&#x27;s novel &quot;Gut Symmetries&quot; (1997) quotes Rukeyser&#x27;s poem &quot;King&#x27;s Mountain&quot;.

Rukeyser&#x27;s translation of a poem by Octavio Paz was adapted by Eric Whitacre for his choral composition &quot;Water Night.&quot; John Adams set one of her texts in his opera &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot;, and Libby Larsen set the poem &quot;Looking at Each Other&quot; in her choral work &quot;Love Songs&quot;.

Writer Marian Evans and composer Chris White collaborated on a play about Rukeyser, &quot;Throat of These Hours&quot;, titled after a line in Rukeyser&#x27;s &quot;Speed of Darkness&quot;.

&quot;JNT: Journal of Narrative Theory&quot; dedicated a special issue to Rukeyser in Fall 2013.

Rukeyser&#x27;s 5-poem sequence &quot;Käthe Kollwitz&quot; (The Speed of Darkness, 1968, Random House) was set by Tom Myron in his composition &quot;Käthe Kollwitz for Soprano and String Quartet,&quot; &quot;written in response to a commission from violist Julia Adams for a work celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Portland String Quartet in 1998.&quot;

Rukeyser&#x27;s poem &quot;Gunday&#x27;s Child&quot; was set to music by the experimental rock band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum.

==Personal life==
Rukeyser was bisexual. In 1936 she had traveled to Spain to cover the People&#x27;s Olympiad for the literary journal Life and Letters. The Spanish Civil War broke out and during her five-day stay, she fell in love with Otto Boch, a German communist athlete who volunteered to fight the fascists, and who was later killed. That experience was evoked in &quot;To be a Jew in the Twentieth Century.&quot; 
Also, her literary agent Monica McCall was her partner for decades.

<doc id="536200" wikidata="Q4047163" url="?curid=536200" title="Polar Bear Express">
<text>The Polar Bear Express is a Canadian passenger train operated by the Ontario Northland Railway in Northern Ontario. Service was introduced in 1964. While designated as a passenger train, the Polar Bear Express also carries freight and is equipped with specialized equipment including boxcars for canoes, snowmobiles and all terrain vehicles. There are also baggage and express cars. In the past a special car existed for canoes but now these are carried in regular boxcars. 

This train service is the only Motorail service currently in Canada, with chaincars (flat cars with tie downs) for carrying cars and light trucks. There are no roads to Moosonee, so vehicles come in and out by train. 

It operates five days per week year-round and connects Cochrane with Moosonee. During the summer months there is an additional train on Sundays and the train often includes a full-length dome car. Prior to 2012, the train carried a full dining car during the summer.

== Scheduled stops ==
Tickets for the passenger service are sold by phone or at offices in Cochrane,
Moosonee, Moose Factory and Timmins. The train will stop on demand in some locations as part of the flag stop service.

The town of Cochrane recommends taking the train to Moosonee for a &quot;great rail excursion&quot; in summer, to view the &quot;hydroelectric dams, isolated homes and perhaps even some wildlife.&quot; 


The &quot;Polar Bear Express&quot; service was expanded on June 5, 2007, after increased funding from the Government of Ontario to ONR was announced in March 2007. It resulted in the discontinuation of the &quot;&quot; mixed freight-passenger service which had operated three days per week, year-round, resulting in dedicated separate freight and passenger rail service to Moosonee.

== Operations ==
In summer 2008, track conditions resulted the train running very late much of the time (2.5 hours by railway announcement). By late 2008, running times had improved somewhat and timings of five and a half to six hours for the - all distances are shown in miles along the tracks - trip were becoming typical. Service deteriorated significantly in 2009 mainly due to bad track conditions and mechanical failures — on one occasion the train, scheduled to arrive in Cochrane at 9:42 in the evening did not arrive until 4:00 in the morning.

Before the 2007 service expansion, the &quot;Polar Bear Express&quot; operated six days per week during the summer months. It leaves Cochrane in the morning, stays in Moosonee for a few hours, and returns to Cochrane in the evening. It was primarily used by tourists, although it was used by an increasing number of local residents.

The name of the train is misleading — polar bears are rarely seen anywhere near Moosonee, although there are some extremely rare exceptions. The Polar Bear Express today mostly services the residents of Moosonee and Moose Factory when they travel south from their communities that lack road connections to the rest of Ontario. During the winter, many passengers are from communities further north who travel to Moosonee by winter road before taking the train, due to the high cost of vehicle transport. The motorail service is important to those living in the northern communities inaccessible by regular roads.

Prior to 2012 the summer train included special programs for children and an entertainment car.

<doc id="536209" wikidata="Q2722811" url="?curid=536209" title="Fitionești">
<text>Fitionești is a commune in the center-north hill area of Vrancea County, Western Moldavia, Romania, with a population of 2,318 as of 2021. The commune is composed of five villages: Ciolănești, Fitionești, Ghimicești, Holbănești, and Mănăstioara. Fitionești is said to have taken its name from the Fetion family, an old family of local boyars. The first historical evidence dates back to the Thracian Bronze Age.

==Geography==
The river Zăbrăuț crosses the village that lies between two hills, surrounded by wooden areas. Fitionești has a varied relief: Bouroș(u) Hill to the East, Valea Rea Valley to the West, followed by Costin Hill; also, Pisc Hill (Pi Chisc) to the northwest, and Ursoaia. Twenty kilometres north of Fitionești, after Glodișteanu Woods, there is Moșinoaiele Monastery (Moșânoaia). These surroundings are proper for (agro)tourism.

The closest town is Panciu, ten kilometres to the South-East, which is virtually the only access way to &quot;civilization&quot;, historically also referred to as &quot;la Vale&quot; (&quot;to the fields&quot;). Another neighboring commune is Movilița, to the North-East. To the west, beyond Valea Rea and Costin hill, there is Muncelu village (Străoane commune).

==Economy==
The inhabitants are mostly farmers. They mainly cultivate maize, beans, and potatoes, also onion, cabbage, radishes, tomatoes, and cucumbers. There are also many vineyards (part of the Panciu vineyard) and orchards in Fitionești. Plums, apples, pears, and sour-cherries are most popular. Also they raise poultry (chicken, geese, ducks, sometimes turkeys), sheep, and cows. They keep horses (they still use them for farming work like ploughing), dogs, and cats.

They produce wine and &quot;rachiu&quot; (a strong alcoholic drink), cheese, and make some of their clothes at home by hand. Also, some popular home manufacture includes soap, carpets, and brooms, usually for family use, not for selling.

==Social facts==
*Literacy: some old people are illiterate
*Ethnicity: In 2002, all inhabitants except two (a German and a Hungarian) were ethnic Romanians
*Religion: 2,803 Romanian Orthodox, 5 Roman Catholics, and 51 Protestants
*Institutions: Căminul Cultural, one communal library, four elementary schools (pupils go on to attend the Ioan Slavici High School in Panciu)
*Places of interest: the Moșinoaiele (or Mușinoaiele) Monastery dedicated to the Ascension of the Holy Virgin, located 20 km from the village. The Mușunoaiele hunting fund (boars, brown bears, deer, does, and foxes).

<doc id="536215" wikidata="Q373788" url="?curid=536215" title="T-84">
<text>The T-84 is a Ukrainian main battle tank (MBT), based on the Soviet T-80 MBT introduced in 1976, specifically the diesel engine version: T-80UD. The T-84 was first built in 1994 and entered service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1999. Its high-performance opposed-piston engine makes it a fast tank, comparable to other modern MBTs with a power-to-weight ratio of about 26 horsepower per tonne (19 kW/t).

The T-84 Oplot is an advanced version incorporating an armoured ammunition compartment in a new turret bustle. Ten of these entered Ukrainian service in 2001. The T-84-120 Yatagan is a prototype model intended for export, mounting a 120 mm gun able to fire NATO-standard tank ammunition and anti-tank guided missiles.

== Development history ==
After the adoption of the T-80 tank, the Soviets began improving its design. The disadvantages of the gas-turbine engine were readily apparent, and so several design projects were initiated to adopt a diesel alternative.

=== Development of the T-80UD ===
Leningrad Kirov Plant (LKZ) began work in 1975 with a diesel 2V16 1500 hp engine on a T-80B chassis. This was designated the Ob. 219RD. Work was not completed until 1983. The design bureau at Omsk Transport Engineering Design Bureau developed a test bed, called the Ob. 644, powered by the V-46-6 of the T-72. Further work on these was not continued, as the main focus at the time was on the gas-turbine engine favored by Defence Minister Dmitry Ustinov.

In 1975, Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau (KMDB) began work on the Object (Ob.) 278, a T-80 powered by a 6TD 1000 hp diesel engine developed for the improved T-64 and (Ob. 450). This quickly became outclassed by the , and so lost favor. The Ob. 478M was a more sophisticated model than the Ob. 478. Improvements included the Sistema fire control system, Shatter active protection system, and a 1,500 hp diesel engine. This too was abandoned as it was considered too costly.

After the death of Ustinov in 1984, the strength of the design bureau of the LKZ began to weaken and the Ministry of Defense started to think seriously about equipping the T-80 tanks with diesel engines.

In September 1985, the government approved the development start of a diesel-powered T-80U. Five prototypes of the Ob. 478B with the 6TD engine were produced by year&#x27;s end. Prototypes of a less sophisticated model, called Ob. 478A, were built for comparison. The government approved production of the Ob. 478B in 1986. The Soviet Army noted problems with the tank, and full-scale production was delayed to make changes. The Soviet Army also opposed a plan to name the tank the T-84, as KMDB had originally envisioned, because it would draw attention to the fact that the Soviets were operating four tanks (T-64, T-72, T-80 and T-84) with more or less similar characteristics. The Central Committee settled the debate, siding with the Army. It was subsequently adopted into service as the T-80UD.

The T-80UD was first deployed to the 4th Guards Tank Division and the 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division. It was first publicly shown at the 1990 Moscow Victory Day Parade, then later in the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt.

=== Development of the T-84 ===
KMDB developed a welded turret to replace cast turrets, which were no longer made in Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union. A T-80UD with this turret, Ob. 478BK, was completed in 1995. Ukraine delivered 175 Ob. 478BE to Pakistan by 1999. The Ob. 478D with Aynet fire control system and Buran night sight was trialed. Pilots of the Ob. 478DU and Ob. 478DU2 were also produced. One prototype appeared at International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) in 1995 as the &quot;T-84 Supertank.&quot; An Ob. 478DM appeared at IDEX 1999 as the T-84M. The Ob. 478DU4 gave rise to the T-84 Oplot, which was marketed to Turkey. The 125 mm caliber gun was replaced with a 120 mm one able to fire NATO ammunition, and designated the T-84-120. This was marketed to Turkey as the Yatagan, and was trialed there in 2000.

The Ukrainian government eventually made good on its promise to buy the T-84 for the Ukrainian Army. Ten T-84Ms were delivered from 2001 to 2003. Ukraine was forced to sell off four of these to the United States when it struggled to finance the tanks.
=== Development of the T-84-120 ===
The T-84-120 Yatagan was developed in 2000 in Kharkiv to NATO standards for the Turkish tender for a new MBT. The tank featured a 120mm smooth bore gun that was capable of firing AT-11 Sniper ATGMs, a reloading mechanism and blow-out panels. The Yatagan was also equipped with communications equipment from the French Thomson company, an FN Herstal machine gun, automatic transmission, a 6TD-2 diesel engine with 1200hp and FCS taken from Oplot. In total, three 120mm guns of different designs were tested on the tank. The T-84-120 Yatagan also participated in the Kyiv parade. The current condition of the tank is unknown.

==Design==

The T-84&#x27;s outstanding feature is a 26 hp/t power-to-weight ratio. It is also designed to perform well in hot climates, and includes an air-conditioned crew compartment (operating temperature range is claimed to be −40 to 55 °C).

The BM Oplot is a further development of the prior T-84 Oplot. The tank has a conventional layout with the driver&#x27;s compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the middle and engine at the rear, accommodating a crew of three.

The driver sitting in the centre is provided with a single-piece hatch cover that opens to the right. The commander on the right and the gunner on the left have single-piece hatches.

The tank has a length of 9.7 m (including the forward-facing gun), a width of 3.4 m without removable side skirts, and a height of 2.8 m. The combat weight of the tank is 51 tons.

===Armament===
The Oplot is armed with a smoothbore 125 mm KBA-3 cannon, a KT-7.62 (PKT) coaxial machine gun and a KT-12.7 anti-aircraft machine gun. The main gun is fed by a loading system equipped with conveyor, automatic loader, and control system. The ammunition includes high explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG), armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) kinetic energy penetrator, and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT).

The main gun can also fire a laser-guided missile against armoured ground vehicles and hovering helicopters within the range of 5,000m. The missile can be fired on the move against travelling targets. A tandem-charge warhead fitted on the missile can defeat targets equipped with explosive reactive armour (ERA) and advanced spaced armour.

The Oplot has 46 rounds of ammunition for the main gun, of which 28 rounds are placed in the automatic loader. Other ammunition types carried are 1,250 rounds for KT-7.62 machine gun, 450 rounds for KT-12.7 machine gun and 450 rounds for AKS Assault rifle.

===Fire control===
The vehicle has three forward-facing periscopes in front of the driver&#x27;s cupola. The centre periscope can be replaced with a night driving device.

The fire control system includes a gunner&#x27;s day sight, PNK-6 commander&#x27;s panoramic sighting system, PTT-2 thermal imaging sight, anti-aircraft sight and anti-aircraft machine gun control system. Detection range of targets for thermal sighting system is up to 8 km.

The tank is also equipped with LIO-V ballistic computer, armament stabiliser and other systems.

The advanced fire-control system enables the gunner or commander to lay and fire the main armament on the move. The stationary and moving targets can be hit with a high first round hit probability.

===Protection===
The protection system includes multilayer passive armour, Duplet explosive reactive armour (ERA), Zaslin Active Protection System, Varta optronic countermeasures system and other tank protection means.

Built-in new generation Duplet anti-tandem-charge warhead ERA protects against APFSDS, HESH and HEAT rounds.

Duplet improves protection against:
* Hand anti-tank grenades, hand-held, and stationary grenade launchers and recoilless guns (including ammunition with tandem-charge warheads)
* Anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) of TOW-2, MILAN, and Shturm-S type
* HEAT projectiles fired by 125 mm tank smoothbore guns
* APFSDS projectiles fired by 125 mm and 120 mm tank guns

Both sides of the driver&#x27;s compartment are fitted with ERA panels for extended protection. The hull sides are hinged with large rubber skirts to withstand the attacks of man-portable anti-tank weapons. The modular ERA package can be easily replaced or upgraded as needed by future requirements.

The Oplot features a Varta optronic countermeasures system for deceiving incoming missiles and anti-tank guided weapons. The system integrates laser warning sensors, infra-red jammer, and smoke or aerosol screen laying system. The optronic countermeasure system can:
* confuse the guidance systems of ATGMs by emitting laser jamming covering the horizontal plane of ±18° relative to the main gun tube and ±2° in the vertical plane
* jam ATGM guidance systems that use laser guidance illumination of targets, semi-automatic laser guided homing projectiles, and artillery systems equipped with laser range-finders by activating the remote fast-deploying aerosol screens in a sector of ±45° relative to the main gun tube

Crew&#x27;s collective protection system protects the crew and interior equipment against effects of nuclear explosions, radioactive substances, toxic agents, biological warfare agents, and detects and suppresses fires in the compartments of crew and power pack.

The Oplot tank can withstand an explosion of up to 10 kg trinitrotoluene (TNT) under the tank track and up to 4 kg TNT under the driver&#x27;s compartment.
The vehicle has overpressure-type NBC protection system and can be fitted with track mine-clearing systems.

Due to the collapse of Soviet Union, the Malyshev Factory was no longer able to obtain ceramic armour modules from Russia and only the initial batch of T-84 were produced with such. Instead, later batches of T-84&#x27;s composite armour is composed of special purpose rubber sandwiched between steel and alloy plates. The exact difference in performance between the new and prior armor is unknown and depends on the performance of dynamic armor.

===Engine and mobility===
BM Oplot is powered by a 6TD-2E 6-cylinder turbocharged liquid-cooled engine, which delivers . It is improved and more environmentally friendly version of the prior 6TD-2 diesel engine, used on the T-84 MBT. The tank could also be powered by a more powerful 6TD-3 diesel, developing . Both engines could use diesel, jet engine fuel, petrol or any mixtures of them.

The engine provides a maximum on-road speed of and a range of with added fuel tanks. The tank is also equipped with a diesel-electric auxiliary power unit to supply power to onboard systems when the main engine is off.

BM Oplot is equipped with torsion bar suspension. Either side of the six dual rubber-tyred road wheels are provided with idler at forward, drive sprocket at the rear, and track support rollers.

The first, second and sixth road wheel stations are fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. The tank can negotiate a gradient of 32° and side slope of 25°. Equally, the tank can ford a water depth of 5m using deep water fording equipment.

==Service history==
===Ukraine===
The first T-84 prototype vehicle rolled out in 1994, and in the same year it was decided to build several more vehicles. They were subjected to extensive company and army trials. After successful completion of the extensive trials programme in the late 1990s the T-84 entered service with the Ukrainian Army in 1999.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at least one T-84 was deployed with the 3rd Tank Brigade in Donbas, near Barvinkove and Slovyansk. T-84 tanks were believed to be deployed with the 14th Mechanized Brigade in Donbas.

===Thailand===
In March 2011, the Royal Thai Army placed an order for 49 Oplot-T to replace its fleet of aging M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks. In September 2011, the Malyshev Plant announced plans to produce the first batch of five Oplot-T tanks for the Thai Army by the end of the year. Under the contract, the Ukrainian company will make 49 tanks worth over US$200 million.

The government approved 7.155 billion baht to purchase the first 49 Oplot tanks to be assigned to several units: the 2nd Cavalry battalion (Royal Guard at Fort Chakrabongse, Prachinburi), the 4th Cavalry battalion (Royal Guard at Kiakkai, Bangkok), the 8th Cavalry battalion (Fort Suranari, Nakhon Ratchasima), and the 9th Cavalry battalion (Fort Ekathotsarot, Phitsanuloke).

In April 2017, it was reported that following the delayed deliveries from this tank, the Royal Thai Army was expected to decline the remainder of the sale and acquired the Chinese VT-4 main battle tank instead of the Ukrainian tank, due to the long term delivery schedule. The signed order for 49 units had to be completed by the month of January, 2017, it was reported that other deliveries may not be expected.

A 26 March 2018 press release by Ukroboronprom stated that the 2011 contract for supplying Oplot-T tanks to Thailand had successfully completed and that the last party of tanks had passed checks by the customers and would be sent to the buyer in the near future.

==Operators==

===Current operators===
: The Ukrainian Ground Forces reportedly had 6 T-84 in service as of 2021, but the current number is unknown. Battlefield footage published in early 2023 indicates least one of the tanks was possibly damaged by a Russian-made ZALA Lancet drone.

On May 12, 2023, Defense Minister Reznikov drove an Oplot at a training ground in Kharkiv Oblast and subsequently announced that the Armed forces of Ukraine would order an unspecified number of Oplots.
: According to &quot;The Military Balance&quot; 2019, Thailand had acquired 49 Oplot-T(Object 478DU9-T) main battle tanks.

=== Evaluation-only operators ===
: 1 unit, for technologies analysis and operational OPFOR training.

===Failed bids===
:, Azerbaijan showed interest in the Oplot main battle tank. The Defense Ministry of Ukraine has long been holding negotiations on this issue. In June 2013, it has been made public that Azerbaijan had instead purchased 100 Russian T-90 tanks, in a series of rearmament deals worth $4 billion with Russia.
:The T-84 Yatagan was offered to the Malaysian Army in 2002. But the contract was lost to the Polish PT-91.
:In 2009, Peru reportedly tested the Oplot tank, but the government of Alan Garcia later decided to acquire test examples of the Chinese MBT-2000 in late 2010, only to have the government of his successor, Ollanta Humala, abandon the purchase in early 2012 to seek other alternatives. , the T-84 was reported to be part of comparative tests to be conducted by Peru. The T-84 competed against the T-90S, the M1A1 Abrams, the Leopard 2A4 and A6, and the T-64 also offered by Ukraine. By September 2013, only the T-84, T-90S, Russian T-80, and M1A1 Abrams were still competing.
: In 2017, Ukraine was in talks with Pakistan for the potential sale of 100 Oplot tanks. Though Pakistan evaluated the Oplot in 2015-2017, it selected the VT-4 main battle tank instead. However later on, Heavy Industries Taxila and Ukrspecexport signed a MoU worth $600 million to upgrade the existing fleet of Pakistan&#x27;s T-80UD MBTs possibly to Oplot-M standard.

<text>Passion is a one-act musical, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Lapine. The story was adapted from Ettore Scola&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Passione d&#x27;Amore&quot;, and its source material, Iginio Ugo Tarchetti&#x27;s 1869 novel &quot;Fosca&quot;. Central themes include love, sex, obsession, illness, passion, beauty, power and manipulation. &quot;Passion&quot; is notable for being one of the few projects that Stephen Sondheim himself conceived, along with &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; and &quot;Road Show&quot;.

Set in Risorgimento-era Italy, the plot concerns a young soldier and the changes in him brought about by the obsessive love of Fosca, his Colonel&#x27;s homely, ailing cousin.

==Background and history==
The story originally came from a 19th-century novel by Iginio Ugo Tarchetti, an experimental Italian writer who was prominently associated with the Scapigliatura movement. His book &quot;Fosca&quot; was a fictionalized recounting of an affair he&#x27;d once had with an epileptic woman when he was a soldier.

Sondheim first came up with the idea of writing a musical when he saw the Italian film in 1983:

As Fosca started to speak and the camera cut back to her, I had my epiphany. I realized that the story was not about how she is going to fall in love with him, but about how he is going to fall in love with her . . . at the same time thinking, &quot;They&#x27;re never going to convince me of that, they&#x27;re never going to pull that off,&quot; all the while knowing they would, that Scola wouldn&#x27;t have taken on such a ripely melodramatic story unless he was convinced that he could make it plausible. By the end of the movie, the unwritten songs in my head were brimming and I was certain of two things. First, I wanted to make it into a musical, the problem being that it couldn&#x27;t be a musical, not even in my nontraditional style, because the characters were so outsized. Second, I wanted James Lapine to write it; he was a romantic, he had a feel for different centuries and different cultures, and he was enthusiastically attracted to weirdness.

As it turned out, Lapine was already exploring the idea of adapting &quot;Muscle&quot;, a memoir by Sam Fussell, for the musical stage. Together, they came up with the idea of a pair of double-billing one acts. Lapine wrote a couple of scenes and Sondheim had just started working on the opening number when he began to feel that his musical style was unsuitable for &quot;Muscle&quot;. The piece was more contemporary and, in his opinion, required a score reflecting pop sensibilities. He called up Lapine and suggested that he find another songwriter, perhaps William Finn, and include it as a companion piece. Meanwhile, they continued to work on &quot;Passion&quot; and as the piece grew, they found that it was enough to fill out an entire evening of theatre. &quot;Muscle&quot; was eventually shelved.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===
After 52 previews, &quot;Passion&quot; opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on May 9, 1994, and closed on January 7, 1995. Directed by James Lapine, the cast starred Jere Shea as Giorgio, Donna Murphy as Fosca and Marin Mazzie as Clara. Scenic design was by Adrianne Lobel, costume design by Jane Greenwood, lighting design by Beverly Emmons, orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick, and music direction by Paul Gemignani. This production was filmed shortly after closing and televised on the Public Broadcasting Service series &quot;American Playhouse&quot; on September 8, 1996. (It was released on DVD in 2003 by Image Entertainment.) The musical ran a total of 280 performances, making it the shortest-running musical ever to win the Tony Award for Best Musical.

The role of Fosca was originally offered to Patti LuPone, but she turned it down to star in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in the West End. LuPone was then famously fired from &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in favor of Glenn Close, who would take the show to Broadway.

On October 20, 2004, there was a tenth anniversary concert at the Ambassador Theatre. It starred Marin Mazzie, Michael Cerveris, John McMartin and Donna Murphy.

===Original London production===
The show opened in the West End, with significant musical and script revisions, at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in 1996. Directed by Jeremy Sams, the cast featured Michael Ball as Giorgio, Helen Hobson as Clara, and Maria Friedman as Fosca (Friedman had previously appeared in several Sondheim musicals in the UK). The production ran for 232 performances. A recording was later made of the show performed in concert, with nearly all of the original London cast recreating their roles and preserving the musical changes from the earlier production.

===2010 London revival===
A production at the Donmar Warehouse in London, as part of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s 80th birthday celebrations, opened on September 10, 2010, in previews, with the official opening September 21, running through November 27. It was directed by Jamie Lloyd, who was the Donmar associate director at the time, and the cast included Argentine actress Elena Roger, as well as Scarlett Strallen and David Thaxton. This production won the Evening Standard Awards, Best Musical Award. David Thaxton won the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical.

===2011 premiere in Germany===
&quot;Passion&quot; received its German-language premiere (translated by Roman Hinze) on January 28, 2011, at the Dresden State Operetta. Directed by Holger Hauer, the lead roles were filled by Marcus Günzel (Giorgio), Maike Switzer (Clara) and Vasiliki Roussi (Fosca). The choir and orchestra of the Dresden State Operetta performed under the musical direction of Peter Christian Feigel. A special feature of this production was its orchestral arrangement for a symphonic orchestra, including a great string ensemble, harpsichord and harp, with no electronic instruments being used and modifications to the musical score being made in cooperation with the composer. &quot;Passion&quot; ran at the Dresden State Operetta in the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons. The work was performed for the CD label “bobbymusic” from August 22 to 25, 2012 using the same performers. It is the first recording in German, and the first recording of the entire work with all of the musical numbers and spoken texts. Since December 2, 2013 the double CD has been on sale at the Dresden State Operetta (www.staatsoperette-dresden.de) as well as online (www.soundofmusic-shop.de or www.bobbymusic.de).

===2013 Off-Broadway revival===
The show was mounted by the East Village-based Classic Stage Company, starring Judy Kuhn as Fosca, Melissa Errico as Clara and Ryan Silverman as Giorgio. Known primarily for their stagings of classical plays, &quot;Passion&quot; was the first musical that the company had ever produced. The production was helmed by John Doyle and took a minimalist approach to the piece. Unlike other Doyle productions of Sondheim works, there were no instruments onstage. The run was extended through April 2013, and a two-disc cast recording was released on July 2 from PS Classics. Rebecca Luker, who played the role of Clara in the Kennedy Center&#x27;s 2002 Sondheim Celebration production, replaced the ill Errico on this recording.

===2016 Scandinavian premiere in Sweden===
&quot;Passion&quot; received its Swedish-language premiere (translated by Ulricha Johnson) on September 17, 2016, at the Kulturhuset Spira. Directed by Victoria Brattström, the lead roles were portrayed by Kalle Malmberg (Giorgio), Mari Lerberg Fossum (Clara) and Annica Edstam (Fosca). The Jönköping Sinfonietta performed under the musical direction of Johan Siberg who also wrote the musical arrangements. The production had a second run at NorrlandsOperan in 2017.

===Other productions===
The musical made its regional premiere at New Line Theatre in St. Louis, MO in 1996, and was later part of the Sondheim Celebration at the Kennedy Center, running from July 19, 2002, through August 23, 2002, directed by Eric Schaeffer. Judy Kuhn and Michael Cerveris played Fosca and Giorgio, with Rebecca Luker as Clara.

The work was presented by the Minnesota Opera in February 2004, staged by Tim Albery and starring Patricia Racette as Fosca, William Burden as Giorgio and Evelyn Pollock as Clara.

In 2004 the show was performed in the Netherlands, and a Dutch-language recording was released—one of the few translations of a Sondheim score. This production had Vera Mann as Fosca, Stanley Burleson as Giorgio and Pia Douwes as Clara.

A semi-staged concert, starring Patti LuPone as Fosca, Michael Cerveris as Giorgio and Audra McDonald as Clara, was held at Lincoln Center in New York for three performances, March 30 – April 1, 2005. Directed by Lonny Price, this production was broadcast on the PBS television show &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; on March 31, 2005. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Program. The score in this production preserved the musical revisions from the London version. This same cast had performed at the Ravinia Festival, Highland Park, Illinois, on August 22–23, 2003.

The show was done at Chicago Shakespeare Theater from October 2, 2007, to November 11, 2007, starring Ana Gasteyer as Fosca, Adam Brazier as Giorgio and Kathy Voytko as Clara.

The work was presented by &quot;Life Like Company&quot; at the Arts Centre Melbourne from November 5, 2014, to November 8, 2014, starring Theresa Borg as Fosca, Kane Alexander as Giorgio and Silvie Paladino as Clara.

The musical had its Italian premiere at the Cantiere Internazionale d&#x27;Arte of Montepulciano on July 12, 2019, directed by Keith Warner. The musical direction was by Roland Boer, and Janie Dee played Fosca.

A production was staged in 2018 at Signature Theatre directed by Matthew Gardiner and starring Claybourne Elder as Giorgio, Natascia Diaz as Fosca and Steffanie Leigh as Clara. It was Signature&#x27;s second production of the work. 

The show was set to open in Pasadena, CA on March 15, 2020, directed by Michael Michetti at Boston Court Pasadena, but was postponed, and later cancelled, due to COVID-19 closures.

In a production produced by Ruthie Henshall who also stars as Fosca, &quot;Passion&quot; opened at the Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester on May 5, 2022. Directed by Michael Strassen.

==Casts==
==Synopsis==
The musical is usually presented in one act. An intermission was added only for the London production.

===Act I===

In Milan in 1863, two lovers are at the height of ecstasy (&quot;Happiness&quot;). The handsome captain, Giorgio, breaks their reverie by telling Clara that he is being transferred to a provincial military outpost. In the next scene, Giorgio is in the mess hall at the army camp with Colonel Ricci, the unit&#x27;s commanding officer, and Dr. Tambourri, its physician. He thinks longingly of Clara (“First Letter”) and she thinks longingly of him (&quot;Second Letter&quot;). Giorgio&#x27;s thoughts are interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream. The Colonel tells him not to worry; it&#x27;s just Fosca, his sick cousin. Giorgio offers to lend her some of his books.

As he begins to adjust to the tedium of life at the outpost, the sensitive Giorgio feels increasingly out of place amongst the other men (&quot;Third Letter&quot;). He starts becoming friendly with the Doctor, who describes Fosca as having a nervous disorder. She frequently collapses into seizures, exposing her suffering and need for connection.

Fosca arrives after dinner to thank Giorgio for the books. When he suggests she keep a novel longer to meditate over it, she explains that she does not read to think or search for truth, but to live vicariously through the characters. She then goes off into a dark musing on her life (&quot;I Read&quot;). Giorgio awkwardly changes the subject, but when he observes a hearse pulling up, she is overtaken by a hysterical convulsion. Giorgio is stunned and appalled (&quot;Transition&quot;).

The following afternoon, the Colonel, the Doctor, Giorgio and Fosca go for a walk together. As they stroll through a castle&#x27;s neglected garden, Giorgio politely engages her in conversation while mentally narrating a letter to Clara. When Fosca confesses that she feels no hope in her life, he tells her that &quot;the only happiness that we can be certain of is love.&quot; Fosca is hurt and embarrassed, but recognizes that Giorgio, like herself, is different from others, and asks for his friendship (&quot;Garden Sequence&quot;).

Giorgio and Clara exchange letters about Fosca. Clara urges him to avoid her whenever possible. When Giorgio is preparing to take a five-day leave, Fosca shows up unexpectedly, dissolving into hysteria and begging him to return soon. Fosca is next seen reading, stone-faced, from a letter Giorgio has sent rejecting her feelings as he and Clara make love (&quot;Trio&quot;).

Upon Giorgio&#x27;s return, Fosca reproaches him. She demands to know about his affair and learns that Clara is married. In a sharp exchange, they agree to sever all ties. Weeks go by with no contact between them, but just as he is beginning to think that he is finally free of Fosca, he is informed by the Doctor that she is dying. His rejection of her love has exacerbated her illness. Giorgio, whose job as a soldier is to save lives, must go and visit her sickbed. He reluctantly agrees.

He enters Fosca&#x27;s chamber, and she implores him to lie beside her while she sleeps. At daybreak, Fosca asks him for a favor before he leaves: &quot;Write a letter for me.&quot; He complies, but the letter she imagines is a fantasy one from Giorgio to herself (“I Wish I Could Forget You”). She is seized by another convulsive attack, and he hastens from the room.

===Act II===

The soldiers gossip about Giorgio and Fosca while playing pool (&quot;Soldiers&#x27; Gossip&quot;). The Colonel thanks Giorgio for the kindness he has shown his cousin and explains her history. As a child, Fosca was doted on by her parents and once had illusions about her looks. When she was seventeen, the Colonel introduced her to an Austrian count named Ludovic. Fosca was taken with him, though she had her reservations. Once they were married, Ludovic took all of her family&#x27;s money. Fosca eventually discovered that he had another wife and a child. When confronted, he smoothly admitted to his deception and vanished. It was then that Fosca first became ill. After her parents died, she went to live with the Colonel, who felt responsible for her circumstances (&quot;Flashback&quot;).

Meanwhile, Clara has written Giorgio a letter (&quot;Sunrise Letter&quot;) addressing her approaching age, in which she admits her fear of losing love when she is old and no longer beautiful. Giorgio makes his way to a desolate mountain and is in the midst of reading when Fosca appears. After Giorgio lashes out at her in anger (&quot;Is This What You Call Love?&quot;), she crumples and faints. He picks her up and carries her back in the rain.

The rain, the ordeal of getting Fosca back to camp and perhaps exposure to her contagious emotions have conspired to give Giorgio a fever. He falls into a slumber and dreams that Fosca is dragging him down into the grave (&quot;Nightmare&quot;). The Doctor sends him off to Milan on sick leave (&quot;Forty Days&quot;). As he boards the train, he is followed once again by Fosca. She apologizes for everything and promises to keep her distance for good. Giorgio pleads with her to give him up. She explains that this cannot happen. Her love is not a choice, it is who she is, and she would gladly die for him (&quot;Loving You&quot;). Giorgio is finally moved by the force of her emotions. He takes her back to the outpost (&quot;Transition&quot;).

The Doctor warns Giorgio that he must stop seeing Fosca, that she threatens his mental and physical health. Giorgio requests to forgo his leave; he feels it his duty to stay and help her as much as he can. Back in Milan, Clara questions him jealously about Fosca. Giorgio asks Clara to leave her husband and start a new life with him, but as she has a child, she cannot.

During Christmas, Giorgio is told that he has been transferred back to military headquarters. Later on, he reads Clara&#x27;s newest letter, in which she asks him to wait until her son is grown before planning a more serious commitment (&quot;Farewell Letter&quot;). Giorgio finds he no longer desires the carefully arranged, convenient affair that they shared (&quot;Just Another Love Story&quot;).

Having discovered the letter Fosca dictated, the Colonel accuses Giorgio of leading her on and demands a duel. The Doctor attempts to mediate the two, but Giorgio insists on seeing her again. He realizes that he loves Fosca, for no one has ever truly loved him but her. That evening, he returns to Fosca&#x27;s room, knowing that the physical act might very well kill her (“No One Has Ever Loved Me”). They embrace, their passion consummated at last.

The duel takes place the following morning behind the castle. Giorgio shoots at the Colonel and lets out a shrill howl eerily reminiscent of Fosca&#x27;s earlier outbursts.

Months later, Giorgio is in a hospital, dazed, recovering from a nervous breakdown. He is told that Fosca died shortly after their night together; the Colonel recovered from the wound. Dreamlike, the other characters in the story reappear as Giorgio begins reading from Fosca&#x27;s last letter. Gradually her voice joins his, and together they look back on their revelations (&quot;Finale&quot;).

The company walks off, Fosca last, leaving Giorgio alone at his table.

==Response and analysis==
&quot;Passion&quot; was generally admired by critics for its ambition but savaged by theatregoers when it first opened. In particular, audiences were repelled by the characterization of Fosca. During previews, people would applaud whenever Fosca had a meltdown. In one performance, someone from the balcony yelled &quot;Die, Fosca! Die!&quot;

Stephen Sondheim believes that the musical is about how &quot;the force of somebody&#x27;s feelings for you can crack you open, and how it is the life force in a deadened world.&quot; In response to the hostility encountered during the early performances, he has said:

The story struck some audiences as ridiculous. They refused to believe that anyone, much less the handsome Giorgio, could come to love someone so manipulative and relentless, not to mention physically repellent, as Fosca. As the perennial banality would have it, they couldn&#x27;t &quot;identify&quot; with the main characters. The violence of their reaction, however, strikes me as an example of &quot;The lady doth protest too much.&quot; I think they may have identified with Giorgio and Fosca all too readily and uncomfortably. The idea of a love that&#x27;s pure, that burns with D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s gemlike flame, emanating from a source so gnarled and selfish, is hard to accept. Perhaps they were reacting to the realization that we are all Fosca, we are all Giorgio, we are all Clara.

In analyzing the musical, Michiko Kakutani of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Passion&quot; had &quot;a lush, romantic score that mirrors the heightened, operatic nature of the story . . . Jonathan Tunick&#x27;s orchestration plays an especially important role in lending the music a richness of texture and bringing out its sweeping melodic lines. The sets and lighting are warm and glowy and fervent, reminiscent of the colors of Italian frescoes and evocative of the story&#x27;s intense, highly dramatic mood. Less a series of individual songs than a hypnotic net of music, the show&#x27;s score traces the shifting, kaleidoscopic emotions of the characters, even as it draws the audience into the dreamlike world of their fevered passions.&quot;

Clive Barnes gave the musical a rave review: &quot;Once in an extraordinary while, you sit in a theater and your body shivers with the sense and thrill of something so new, so unexpected, that it seems, for those fugitive moments, more like life than art. &quot;Passion&quot; is just plain wonderful — emotional and yes, passionate . . . Sondheim&#x27;s music — his most expressive yet — glows and glowers, and Tunick has found the precise tonal colorations for its impressionistic moods and emotional overlays. From the start of his career, Sondheim has pushed the parameters of his art. Here is the breakthrough. Exultantly dramatic, this is the most thrilling piece of theater on Broadway.&quot;

The &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the original Broadway production described it as an &quot;unalloyed love story . . . The score contains some insinuating melodies. You can hear madness in the ecstatic lilt.&quot; But ultimately, the reviewer felt that &quot;the boldness of the enterprise never quite pays off. The musical leads an audience right up to the moment of transcendence but is unable in the end to provide the lift that would elevate the material above the disturbing.&quot;

In his review of the Off-Broadway revival, Ben Brantley wrote of it as &quot;the most personal and internalized of Sondheim&#x27;s works . . . Of all the directors who have staged Mr. Sondheim&#x27;s musicals, no one cuts closer to their heart than John Doyle, a minimalist with a scalpel. When it was first staged, in 1994, this concentrated portrait of a romantic triangle seemed to take place at a chilly, analytic remove. In contrast Mr. Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Passion&quot; comes across as a pulsing collective fever dream. And it reminds us that out of such dreams a startling clarity can emerge, almost painful in its acuteness . . . What follows is the gradual shift of Giorgio&#x27;s affections from the seductive, radiant Clara to the demanding Fosca, who pursues him with an obsessiveness to rival the revenge fixation of Sweeney Todd. If this is, on the surface, a most improbable transition, it also feels inevitable here, as Giorgio arrives at the realization that ‘love within reason is not love at all’ . . . but I didn&#x27;t stop to think that I was listening to songs. I was hearing thought. And at moments, I was hearing a distillation of pure emotion.&quot;

<text>Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF), also known as black typhus or Ordog Fever, is a hemorrhagic fever and zoonotic infectious disease originating in Bolivia after infection by Machupo mammarenavirus.

BHF was first identified in 1963 as an ambisense RNA virus of the &quot;Arenaviridae&quot; family, by a research group led by Karl Johnson. The mortality rate is estimated at 5 to 30 percent. Due to its pathogenicity, Machupo virus requires Biosafety Level Four conditions, the highest level.

During the period between February and March 2007, some 20 suspected BHF cases (3 fatal) were reported to the Servicio Departamental de Salud (SEDES) in Beni Department, Bolivia. In February 2008, at least 200 suspected new cases (12 fatal) were reported to SEDES. In November 2011, a second case was confirmed near the departmental capital of Trinidad, and a serosurvey was conducted to determine the extent of Machupo virus infections in the department. A SEDES expert involved in the survey expressed his concerns about the expansion of the virus to other provinces outside the endemic regions of Mamoré and Iténez provinces.

==Epidemiology==

=== History ===
The disease was first encountered in 1962, in the Bolivian village of San Joaquín, hence the name &quot;Bolivian&quot; Hemorrhagic Fever. When initial investigations failed to find an arthropod carrier, other sources were sought before finally determining that the disease was carried by infected mice. Although mosquitoes were not the cause as originally suspected, the extermination of mosquitoes using DDT to prevent malaria proved to be indirectly responsible for the outbreak in that the accumulation of DDT in various animals along the food chain led to a shortage of cats in the village; subsequently, a mouse plague erupted in the village, leading to an epidemic.

=== Vectors ===
The vector is the large vesper mouse (&quot;Calomys callosus&quot;), a rodent indigenous to northern Bolivia. Infected animals are asymptomatic and shed the virus in excreta, thereby infecting humans. Evidence of person-to-person transmission of BHF exists but is believed to be rare.

===Symptoms===
The infection has a slow onset with fever, malaise, headache and myalgia, very similar to Malaria symptoms. Petechiae (blood spots) on the upper body and bleeding from the nose and gums are observed when the disease progresses to the hemorrhagic phase, usually within seven days of onset. Severe hemorrhagic or neurologic symptoms are observed in about one third of patients. Neurologic symptoms involve tremors, delirium, and convulsions. The mortality rate is about 25%.

===Prevention===
Measures to reduce contact between the vesper mouse and humans may have contributed to limiting the number of outbreaks, with no cases identified between 1973 and 1994. Although there are no cures or vaccine for the disease, a vaccine developed for the genetically related Junín virus which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever has shown evidence of cross-reactivity to Machupo virus, and may therefore be an effective prophylactic measure for people at high risk of infection. Post infection (and providing that the person survives the infection), those that have contracted BHF are usually immune to further infection of the disease.

==Weaponization==
Bolivian hemorrhagic fever was one of three hemorrhagic fevers and one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program in 1969. Albert Nickel, a 53-year old animal caretaker at Fort Detrick, died in 1964 from the disease after being bitten by an infected mouse. Nickel Place, on Fort Detrick, is named in his honor. It was also under research by the Soviet Union, under the Biopreparat bureau.

==Vaccine research==
Investigational vaccines exist for Argentine hemorrhagic fever and RVF; however, neither is approved by FDA or commonly available in the United States.

The structure of the attachment glycoprotein has been determined by X-ray crystallography and this glycoprotein is likely to be an essential component of any successful vaccine.

<text>Utena County () is one of ten counties in Lithuania. It is the country&#x27;s most sparsely populated county. The capital and the largest city in the county is Utena, which is from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. On 1 July 2010, the county administration was abolished. Since that date, Utena County remains as the territorial and statistical unit. It borders Latvia.

==History==
Utena is one of the oldest settlements in Lithuania and is mentioned in historical chronicles as early as in 1261.

==Municipalities==
It is divided into six municipalities:

==Economy==
The county has a well-developed network of roads. Main branches of economy are textile, food and timber processing, beer and wine production, power engineering.

==Tourism==
Utena County is the second most popular tourism destination in Lithuania (after the seaside). Approximately 31% of territory is covered with forests. There are 1002 lakes in the county. They are connected by rivers and provide good opportunities for water tourism. One of the biggest tourism attractions is Aukštaitija National Park. In addition, the county has six other regional parks. There are a number of unique places of interest that can be found only in Utena county, e.g., Asveja, the longest lake in Lithuania and Lake Tauragnas, the deepest one; Horse Museum, Lithuanian Museum of Ancient Beekeeping, Lithuanian Museum of Ethnocosmology, narrow gauge railway, a burial mound exposition, an exhibition of stone dust pictures.

<text>The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) is a US government agency that is part of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), operating under the control of the National Weather Service (NWS), which in turn is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States Department of Commerce (DoC).

Headquartered at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center is tasked with forecasting the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the contiguous United States. It issues convective outlooks, mesoscale discussions, and watches as a part of this process. Convective outlooks are issued for the following eight days (issued separately for Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Days 4–8), and detail the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the given forecast period, although tornado, hail and wind details are only available for Days 1 and 2. Days 3–8 use a probabilistic scale, determining the probability for a severe weather event in percentage categories (15%/yellow and 30%/orange).

Mesoscale discussions are issued to provide information on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive for the development of severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.

The agency is also responsible for forecasting fire weather (indicating conditions that are favorable for wildfires) in the contiguous U.S., issuing fire weather outlooks for Days 1, 2, and 3–8, which detail areas with various levels of risk for fire conditions (such as fire levels and fire alerts).

==History==
The Storm Prediction Center began in 1952 as SELS (Severe Local Storms Unit), the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. In 1954, the unit moved its forecast operations to Kansas City, Missouri. SELS began issuing convective outlooks for predicted thunderstorm activity in 1955, and began issuing radar summaries in three-hour intervals in 1960; with the increased duties of compiling and disseminating radar summaries, this unit became the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) in 1966, remaining headquartered in Kansas City.

In 1968, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center began issuing status reports on weather watches; the agency then made its first computerized data transmission in 1971. On April 2, 1982, the agency issued the first &quot;Particularly Dangerous Situation&quot; watch, which indicates the imminent threat of a major severe weather event over the watch&#x27;s timespan. In 1986, the NSSFC introduced two new forecast products: the Day 2 Convective Outlook (which include probabilistic forecasts for outlined areas of thunderstorm risk for the following day) and the Mesoscale Discussion (a short-term forecast outlining specific areas under threat for severe thunderstorm development).

In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center relocated its operations to Norman, Oklahoma, and was rechristened the Storm Prediction Center. At that time, the guidance center was housed at Max Westheimer Airport (now the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport), co-located in the same building as the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office (the latter of which, in addition to disseminating forecasts, oversees the issuance of weather warnings and advisories for the western two-thirds of Oklahoma and western portions of North Texas, and issues outline and status updates for SPC-issued severe thunderstorm and tornado watches that include areas served by the Norman office). In 1998, the center began issuing the National Fire Weather Outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to the development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors. The Day 3 Convective Outlook (which is similar in format to the Day 2 forecast) was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000, and was made an official product in 2001.

In 2006, the Storm Prediction Center, National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Norman Forecast Office moved their respective operations into the newly constructed National Weather Center, near Westheimer Airport. Since the agency&#x27;s relocation to Norman, the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base would assume control of issuing the Storm Prediction Center&#x27;s severe weather products in the event that the SPC is no longer able to issue them in the event of an outage (such as a computer system failure or building-wide power disruption) or emergency (such as an approaching strong tornadic circulation or tornado on the ground) affecting the Norman campus; on April 1, 2009, the SPC reassigned responsibilities for issuing the center&#x27;s products in such situations to the 15th Operational Weather Squadron based out of Scott Air Force Base.

===Brief history timeline===

==Overview==
The Storm Prediction Center is responsible for forecasting the risk of severe weather caused by severe thunderstorms, specifically those producing tornadoes, hail of in diameter or larger, and/or winds of [50 knots] or greater. The agency also forecasts hazardous winter and fire weather conditions. It does so primarily by issuing convective outlooks, severe thunderstorm watches, tornado watches and mesoscale discussions.

There is a three-stage process in which the area, time period, and details of a severe weather forecast are refined from a broad-scale forecast of potential hazards to a more specific and detailed forecast of what hazards are expected, and where and in what time frame they are expected to occur. If warranted, forecasts will also increase in severity through this three-stage process.

The Storm Prediction Center employs a total of 43 personnel, including five lead forecasters, ten mesoscale/outlook forecasters, and seven assistant mesoscale forecasters. Many SPC forecasters and support staff are heavily involved in scientific research into severe and hazardous weather. This involves conducting applied research and writing technical papers, developing training materials, giving seminars and other presentations locally and nationwide, attending scientific conferences, and participating in weather experiments.

==Convective outlooks==
The Storm Prediction Center issues convective outlooks (AC), consisting of categorical and probabilistic forecasts describing the general threat of severe convective storms over the contiguous United States for the next six to 192 hours (Day 1 through Day 8). These outlooks are labeled and issued by day, and are issued up to five times per day.

The categorical levels of risks are TSTM (for Thunder Storm: light green shaded area – rendered as a brown line prior to April 2011 – indicating a risk for general thunderstorms), &quot;MRGL&quot; (for Marginal: darker green shaded area, indicating a very low but present risk of severe weather); &quot;SLGT&quot; (for Slight: yellow shaded area – previously rendered as a green line – indicating a slight risk of severe weather); &quot;ENH&quot; (for Enhanced: orange shaded area, which replaced the upper end of the SLGT category on October 22, 2014); &quot;MDT&quot; (for Moderate: red shaded area – previously rendered as a red line – indicating a moderate risk of severe weather); and &quot;HIGH&quot; (pink shaded area – previously a rendered as a fuchsia line – indicating a high risk of severe weather). Significant severe areas (referred to as &quot;hatched areas&quot; because of their representation on outlook maps) refer to a threat of increased storm intensity that is of &quot;significant severe&quot; levels (F2/EF2 or stronger tornado, or larger hail, or winds or greater).

In April 2011, the SPC introduced a new graphical format for its categorical and probability outlooks, which included the shading of risk areas (with the colors corresponding to each category, as mentioned above, being changed as well) and population, county/parish/borough and interstate overlays. The new shaded maps also incorporated a revised color palette for the shaded probability categories in each outlook.

In 2013, the SPC incorporated a small table under the Convective Outlook&#x27;s risk category map that indicates the total coverage area by square miles, the total estimated population affected and major cities included within a severe weather risk area.

Public severe weather outlooks (PWO) are issued when a significant or widespread outbreak is expected, especially for tornadoes. From November to March, it can also be issued for any threat of significant tornadoes in the nighttime hours, noting the lower awareness and greater danger of tornadoes at that time of year.

===Categories===

A marginal risk day indicates storms of only limited organization, longevity, coverage and/or intensity, typically isolated severe or near-severe storms with limited wind damage, large hail and possibly a low tornado risk. Wind gusts of at least and hailstones of around in diameter are common storm threats within a marginal risk; depending on the sufficient wind shear, a tornado – usually of weak (EF0 to EF1) intensity and short duration – may be possible. This category replaced the &quot;SEE TEXT&quot; category on October 22, 2014.

A slight risk day typically will indicate that the threat exists for scattered severe weather, including scattered wind damage (produced by straight-line sustained winds and/or gusts of 60 to 70 mph), scattered severe hail (varying in size from to ) and/or isolated tornadoes (often of shorter duration and varying weak to moderate intensity, depending on the available wind shear and other sufficient atmospheric parameters). During the peak severe weather season, most days will have a slight risk somewhere in the United States. Isolated significant severe events are possible in some circumstances, but are generally not widespread.

An enhanced risk day indicates that there is a greater threat for severe weather than that which would be indicated by a slight risk, but conditions are not adequate for the development of widespread significant severe weather to necessitate a moderate category, with more numerous areas of wind damage (often with wind gusts of to ), along with severe hail (occasionally over ) and several tornadoes (in some setups, isolated strong tornadoes are possible). Severe storms are expected to be more concentrated and of varying intensities. These days are quite frequent in the peak severe weather season and occur occasionally at other times of year. This risk category replaced the upper end of &quot;slight&quot; on October 22, 2014, although a few situations that previously warranted a moderate risk were reclassified as enhanced (i.e. 45% wind or 15% tornado with no significant area).

A moderate risk day indicates that more widespread and/or more dangerous severe weather is possible, with significant severe weather often more likely. Numerous tornadoes (some of which may be strong and potentially long-track), more widespread or severe wind damage (often with gusts over ) and/or very large/destructive hail (up to or exceeding in diameter) could occur. Major events, such as large tornado outbreaks or widespread straight-line wind events, are sometimes also possible on moderate risk days, but with greater uncertainty. Moderate risk days are not terribly uncommon, and typically occur several times a month during the peak of the severe weather season, and occasionally at other times of the year. Slight and enhanced risk areas typically surround areas under a moderate risk, where the threat is lower.

A high risk day indicates a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather. This includes a large number of tornadoes - many of which will likely be strong to violent and on the ground for a half-hour or longer, or widespread and very destructive straight-line winds, likely in excess of . Hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well. Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.

The Storm Prediction Center began asking for public comment on proposed categorical additions to the Day 1-3 Convective Outlooks on April 21, 2014, for a two-month period. The Storm Prediction Center broadened this system beginning on October 22, 2014 by adding two new risk categories to the three used originally. The new categories that were added are a &quot;marginal risk&quot; (replacing the &quot;SEE TEXT&quot; contours, see below) and an &quot;enhanced risk&quot;. The latter is used to delineate areas where severe weather will occur that would fall under the previous probability criteria of an upper-end slight risk, but do not warrant the issuance of a moderate risk. In order from least to greatest threat, these categories are ranked as: marginal, slight, enhanced, moderate, and high.
===Issuance and usage===

Convective outlooks are issued by the Storm Prediction Center in Zulu time (also known as Universal Coordinated Time or UTC).

The categories at right refer to the risk levels for the specific severe weather event occurring within of any point in the delineated region, as described in the previous section. The Day 1 Convective Outlook, issued five times per day at 0600Z (valid from 1200Z of the current day until 1200Z the following day), 1300Z and 1630Z (the &quot;morning updates&quot;, valid until 1200Z the following day), 2000Z (the &quot;afternoon update&quot;, valid until 1200Z the following day), and the 0100Z (the &quot;evening update&quot;, valid until 1200Z the following day), provides a textual forecast, map of categories and probabilities, and chart of probabilities. Prior to January 28, 2020, the Day 1 was currently the only outlook to issue specific probabilities for tornadoes, hail or wind. It is the most descriptive and highest accuracy outlook, and typically has the highest probability levels.

Day 2 outlooks, issued twice daily at 0600Z in Daylight Saving Time or 0700Z in Standard Time and 1730Z, refer to predicted risks of convective weather for the following day (1200Z to 1200Z of the next calendar day; for example, a Day 2 outlook issued on April 12, 2100, would be valid from 1200Z on April 13, 2100, through 1200Z on April 14, 2100) and include only a categorical outline, textual description, and a map of categories and probabilities. Day 2 moderate risks are fairly uncommon, and a Day 2 high risk has only been issued twice (for April 7, 2006 and for April 14, 2012). Probabilities for tornadoes, hail and wind applying to the Day 1 Convective Outlook were incorporated into the Day 2 Convective Outlook on January 28, 2020, citing research to SPC operations and improvements in numerical forecast guidance that have increased forecaster confidence in risk estimation for those hazards in that timeframe. The individual hazard probabilistic forecasts replaced the existing &quot;total severe&quot; probability graph for general severe convective storms that had been used for the Day 2 outlook beforehand.

Day 3 outlooks refer to the day after tomorrow, issued twice daily since August 13, 2024 at 0730Z in Daylight Saving Time or 0830Z in Standard Time and 1930Z and include the same products (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only twenty times since the product became operational (most recently for March 22, 2022). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include &quot;significant severe&quot; weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).

Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term official SPC Forecast Product, and often change significantly from day to day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines the areas in which severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.

Local forecast offices of the National Weather Service, radio and television stations, and emergency planners often use the forecasts to gauge the potential severe weather threats to their areas. Even after the marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted severe weather risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house severe weather outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to the current system have chosen not to outline marginal risk areas.

Generally, the convective outlook boundaries or lines – general thunderstorms (light green), marginal (dark green), slight (yellow), enhanced (orange), moderate (red) and high (purple) – will be continued as an arrow or line not filled with color if the risk area enters another country (Canada or Mexico) or across waters beyond the United States coastline. This indicates that the risk for severe weather is also valid in that general area of the other side of the border or oceanic boundary.
==Mesoscale discussions==
SPC mesoscale discussions (MDs) once covered convection (mesoscale convective discussions [MCDs]) and precipitation (mesoscale precipitation discussions [MPDs]); MPDs are now issued by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). MCDs generally precede the issuance of a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch, by one to three hours when possible. Mesoscale discussions are designed to give local forecasters an update on a region where a severe weather threat is emerging and an indication of whether a watch is likely and details thereof, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. MCDs contain meteorological information on what is happening and what is expected to occur in the next few hours, and forecast reasoning in regard to weather watches. Mesoscale discussions are often issued to update information on watches already in effect, and sometimes when one is to be canceled. Mesoscale discussions are occasionally used as advance notice of a categorical upgrade of a scheduled convective outlook.

===Example===

=== Meso-gamma mesoscale discussion ===

SPC mesoscale discussions for a high-impact and high-confidence strong tornadoes (EF2+) or winds greater than are called meso-gamma mesoscale discussions. Meso-gamma mesoscale discussions are rarely issued by the SPC. , the Storm Prediction Center has issued 42 meso-gamma mesoscale discussions.

==Weather watches==

Watches (WWs) issued by the SPC are generally less than in area and are normally preceded by a mesoscale discussion. Watches are intended to be issued preceding the arrival of severe weather by one to six hours. They indicate that conditions are favorable for thunderstorms capable of producing various modes of severe weather, including large hail, damaging straight-line winds and/or tornadoes. In the case of severe thunderstorm watches organized severe thunderstorms are expected but conditions are not thought to be especially favorable for tornadoes (although they can occur in such areas where one is in effect, and some severe thunderstorm watch statements issued by the SPC may note a threat of isolated tornadic activity if conditions are of modest favorability for storm rotation capable of inducing them), whereas for tornado watches conditions are thought to be favorable for severe thunderstorms to produce tornadoes.

In situations where a forecaster expects a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather, a watch with special enhanced wording, &quot;Particularly Dangerous Situation&quot; (PDS), is subjectively issued. It is occasionally issued with tornado watches, normally for the potential of major tornado outbreaks, especially those with a significant threat of multiple tornadoes capable of producing F4/EF4 and F5/EF5 damage and/or staying on the ground for long-duration – sometimes uninterrupted – paths. A PDS severe thunderstorm watch is very rare and is typically reserved for derecho events impacting densely populated areas.

Watches are not &quot;warnings&quot;, where there is an immediate severe weather threat to life and property. Although severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings are ideally the next step after watches, watches cover a threat of organized severe thunderstorms over a larger area and may not always precede a warning; watch &quot;busts&quot; do sometimes occur should thunderstorm activity not occur at all or that which does develop never reaches the originally forecast level of severity. Warnings are issued by local National Weather Service offices, not the Storm Prediction Center, which is a national guidance center.

The process of issuing a convective watch begins with a conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. If after collaboration a watch is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue a watch approximation product which is followed by the local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public of the meaning behind the watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.

Watch outline products provide a visual map depiction of the issued watch; the SPC typically delineates watches within this product in the form of &quot;boxes&quot;, which technically are represented as either squares, rectangles (horizontal or vertical) or parallelograms depending on the area it covers. Jurisdictions outlined by the county-based watch product as being included in the watch area may differ from the actual watch box; as such, certain counties, parishes or boroughs not covered by the fringes of the watch box may actually be included in the watch and vice versa. Watches can be expanded, contracted (by removing jurisdictions where SPC and NWS forecasters no longer consider there to be a viable threat of severe weather, in which case, the watch box may take on a trapezoidal representation in map-based watch products) or canceled before their set time of expiration by local NWS offices.

===Example===


==Fire weather products==

The Storm Prediction Center also is responsible for issuing fire weather outlooks (FWD) for the continental United States. These outlooks are a guidance product for local, state and federal government agencies, including local National Weather Service offices, in forecasting the potential for wildfires. The outlooks issued are for Day 1, Day 2, and Days 3–8. The Day 1 product is issued at 4:00 a.m. Central Time and is updated at 1700Z, and is valid from 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 2 outlook is issued at 1000Z and is updated at 2000Z for the forecast period of 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 3–8 outlook is issued at 2200Z, and is valid from 1200Z two days after the current calendar date to 1200Z seven days after the current calendar date.

There are four types of Fire Weather Outlook areas: &quot;See Text&quot;, a &quot;Critical Fire Weather Area for Wind and Relative Humidity&quot;, an &quot;Extremely Critical Fire Weather Area for Wind and Relative Humidity&quot;, and a &quot;Critical Fire Weather Area for Dry Thunderstorms&quot;. The outlook type depends on the forecast weather conditions, severity of the predicted threat, and local climatology of a forecast region. &quot;See Text&quot; is a map label used for outlining areas where fire potential is great enough to pose a limited threat, but not enough to warrant a critical area, similar to areas using the same notation title that were formerly outlined in convective outlooks. Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are typically issued when strong winds ( &gt; ; for Florida) and low relative humidity (usually &lt; 20%) are expected to occur where dried fuels exist, similar to a slight, enhanced, or moderate risk of severe weather. Critical Fire Weather Areas for Dry Thunderstorms are typically issued when widespread or numerous thunderstorms producing rainfall of little accumulation to provide sufficient ground wetting ( &lt; ) are expected to occur where dried fuels exist. Extremely Critical Fire Weather Areas for Wind and Relative Humidity are issued when very strong winds and very low humidity are expected to occur with very dry fuels. Extremely Critical areas are issued relatively rarely, similar to the very low frequency of high risk areas in convective outlooks (see List of Storm Prediction Center extremely critical days).

<doc id="536250" wikidata="Q123516842" url="?curid=536250" title="Countermeasure">
<text>A countermeasure is a measure or action taken to counter or offset another one. As a general concept, it implies precision and is any technological or tactical solution or system designed to prevent an undesirable outcome in the process. The first known use of the term according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary was in 1923.

Countermeasures can refer to the following disciplinary spectrum:
* Medicine
* Materials engineering
* Electro-magnetic engineering
* Policing
* Information technology
* International Law
* Diplomatic security
* Pollution prevention
* Aviation

Defense countermeasures are often divided into &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot;.

==Active==
&quot;Active&quot; countermeasures mean the system user or the defender takes an active position because the incoming incident is known so the system takes active approaches to deal with such possible damage. Such an approach may include setting up a security method for the incident or actively trying to stop or intersect such damage.

==Passive==
&quot;Passive&quot; countermeasures mean the system is not aware of the incoming incident or potential security issues. To mitigate the result of any security issues, the system sets up a set of passive approach which only activates when the system encounters security problems. Usually, &quot;Passive&quot; countermeasures include: 
* Security Technology
This includes information on security or defensive technology, usually a way to protect the system. For example, security software or firewall could also be thought of as an approach to defensive technology. These methods detect potential security issues and report back to the system or protect the system when the system is under a certain threat.
* Damage Control
This means the system has damage control about the possible outcome of the security problem. For example, the system might have a backup in a remote area so even if the current system is damaged, the system could switch to the remote backup and works seamlessly. 
* Fortification
This means the system sets up a security approach to separate the core of the system. This approach is commonly used in a modern server network, where the server user has to go through a jump server to access the core server. The jump server works as a fortification to separate the core server and the outside, which the core server sometimes is not connected to the internet and only connects to the local network, so the user needs to access the jump server to access the core server

<doc id="536252" wikidata="Q25660966" url="?curid=536252" title="Tangiwai">
<text>Tangiwai is a census area and a small rural community in the Ruapehu District of the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located east of Ohakune and Rangataua and west of Waiouru on State Highway 49. In 2018 37.5% of the area&#x27;s 1,281 residents worked in agriculture, forestry and fishing and 7.1% in manufacturing.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;weeping water&quot; for .

New Zealand&#x27;s worst rail accident, the Tangiwai disaster, occurred near Tangiwai on 24 December 1953. The Whangaehu River rail bridge collapsed beneath a Wellington-to-Auckland express passenger train. The locomotive and first six carriages derailed into the river, killing 151 people. The subsequent Board of Inquiry found that the accident was caused by the collapse of the tephra dam holding back nearby Mount Ruapehu&#x27;s crater lake, creating a large lahar in the Whangaehu River, which destroyed one of the bridge piers at Tangiwai only minutes before the train reached the bridge. A memorial has been built at the accident site.

Tirorangi Marae and Rangiteauria meeting house is located in the Tangiwai area. It is a traditional meeting ground of the Ngāti Rangi hapū of Ngāti Rangihaereroa, Ngāti Rangiteauria and Ngāti Tongaiti.

== Timber ==

George Syme &amp; Co ran a saw mill to cut totara, rimu, matai and kahikatea, linked to the station by a tramway from 1908 until 1930. The mill burnt down in 1926.

Karioi state forest was set up in November 1926, with set aside for forestry, and taken on by New Zealand Forest Service from 31 March 1927. It stretches about north east from Tangiwai onto the southern slopes of Ruapehu. By March 1931, over 10.7m trees had been planted on , for £56,524, 15s 10d. Most of the planting was on land with cobalt deficiency and therefore considered unsuitable for farming, though it also included at least of flax. Trees have been harvested since the late 1960s. Winstone Pulp International (WPI) bought of Waimarino Forest in 1989 and cutting rights to of Karioi Forest in 1990.

=== Sawmill ===
To cut the timber, MSD Spiers built Tangiwai Sawmill beside the railway station in 1966. It was bought by nearby pulp mill owner, Winstone Pulp International Ltd (WPI), in 1993 and upgraded to mill over a year, using of logs, a planer, optimiser, dry-sheds, kilns and a wood waste heat plant, added in 2001. In April 2008, Ernslaw One Ltd purchased WPI. Ernslaw One owned by the Malaysian Tiong Family, bought WPI for $117,293,314. WPI employed about 300 staff. At 30 September 2006, its forest crop was valued at $83m and its fixed assets at $38.7m. It earned $131m, but lost $10.1m. Ernslaw One also has forests and mills in Gisborne, Naseby and Tapanui.

=== Pulp mill ===
A further use for the timber was the pulp mill, though it had a troubled beginning. It produces a year when running a single-shift. It is mainly used for newsprint and paperboard, much of it exported through New Plymouth, then CentrePort Wellington and now Napier. A bark furnace and a heat exchanger recover of heat from steam for drying the pulp, electricity and LPG supplying the other energy. Excess heat is used to dry timber from the sawmill. In 2004 the mill had 145 staff.

In 1976 Winstone and Chonju Paper Manufacturing, a Samsung subsidiary, built a thermo-mechanical pulp mill, almost north of the sawmill. In 1978 the first load of logs was delivered to the mill. At least 70% of the pulp was to go to Chonju, but, when the mill came on stream in 1979, prices for pulp and newspaper had fallen and the pulp was of variable quality. In 1981 the mill was caught up in the Think Big debate, when the government took $10m in preference shares and made a $5m loan. Losses that year were $7.133m and rose to $11m. Later in 1981 H.W. Smith Ltd, a company linked with Brierley Investments Ltd, increased its 10% holding in Winstone to 24.9% and to 27% in 1983. Brierley gained full control of Winstone when the government sold its interests. The last remaining director from the Winstone family, Donald, retired. In early 1988, Fletcher Challenge bought Winstone for $444m. Karioi was sold within months to a Hong Kong investment company. The current name of Winstone Pulp International Ltd was adopted. WPI was sold to Ernslaw One group in 2008.

=== 2024 mills closure ===
In August 2024, Winstone Pulp International proposed closing its two central North Island mills due to high power prices. During a public meeting in Raetihi on 27 August, Mayor of Ruapehu Weston Kirton urged the New Zealand Government to offer an electrical subsidy to Winstones&#x27; mills. National Party Member of Parliament Suze Redmayne responded that the Government was working with electrical utility companies to find solutions. On 10 September 2024, the company confirmed that it would close down its Karioi pulp mill and Tangiwai timber mill by October 2024, leading to the loss of 230 jobs. WPI chief executive Mike Ryan attributed the closure to the &quot;dual impact&quot; of &quot;uncompetitive&quot; energy prices in New Zealand and the relatively low current and forecast mark prices for pulp and timber.&quot; Ryan confirmed that WPI would support staff by helping them to find jobs with other industry players, work with the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue Department to support retrenched staff and provide access to wellbeing providers and financial advisers. 

WPI had previously criticised high power prices for making its business operations unsustainable, which was disputed by electrical utility company Mercury Energy. On 5 August, the company had also temporarily paused operations at both Karioi and Tangiwai, citing high energy prices. In response to WPI&#x27;s closure proposal, workers had unsuccessfully petitioned to save the mills and made 189 submissions to improve the mills and cut down on costs. RNZ reported that many employees had said that the mill&#x27;s closure would lead to job losses in the Ruapehu District and cause families to migrate to Australia for work in the timber industry.

First Union and E tū issued a joint statement describing the mills&#x27; closure as &quot;devastating.&quot; First Union general secretary Dennis Maga thanked the local mayors and Associate Energy Minister Shane Jones for fighting to keep the mills open but criticised the Government for not intervening to address the impact of its previous energy reforms. Ruapehu Mayor Kirton described the mills&#x27; closures as a &quot;massive blow to Ruapehu and our communities.&quot; He confirmed that the Ruapehu District Council would work with WINZ and its iwi partners to support affected workers. Energy Minister Simeon Brown defended the New Zealand Government&#x27;s decision not to intervene, describing it as a &quot;commercial decision.&quot; In response, Labour&#x27;s small business and manufacturing spokesperson Helen White criticised the Government for not doing more to keep the mills open.

<text>The Devič Monastery (; ) is a Serbian Orthodox abbey in Kosovo. It was built in 1434 and is dedicated to St Joanikije of Devič. Devič was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.

==History==
The founder of the monastery is Despot Đurađ Branković, who had it built in memory of his daughter. In the Ottoman census from 1455, the monastery is mentioned as the church of the Theotokos (dedicated to The Entry of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple). During Turkish occupation the monastery was pulled down, but the church and the site with the grave of St. Joanikije was reconstructed, and was painted in 1578.

The monastery was destroyed and burnt down during World War II in 1941 by forces of the Albanian Fascist Party, the prior Damaskin Bošković was killed, and Italian troops disassembled the two big bells and took them away in 1942. It was rebuilt in 1947.

Devič was a target of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1999. The monastery was vandalized and all food and two cars were stolen. The marble tomb of the patron saint St. Joannicius of Devič was desecrated by local Albanian in June 1999. Since then it has been under the constant protection of French KFOR troops.

It was the target of new attacks by Albanians in the most serious unrest in Kosovo on 18 March 2004 when the nuns were evacuated for safety reasons by Danish KFOR troops. Following that the monastery was pillaged and torched. The Serbian Orthodox Church received confirmation of the monastery&#x27;s plight the following day from the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).

<text>Rodney Dean Drayton (born 1941) is a minister of the Uniting Church in Australia (UCA) and was President of the UCA Assembly from July 2003 to July 2006. He lectures on a part-time basis in missiology at Sydney&#x27;s United Theological College (UTC).

==Biography==

Drayton was born in Whyalla, South Australia in 1941. He spent his childhood growing up in the suburbs of Adelaide. He has received a BSc (Hons) from the University of Adelaide, a BD from the Melbourne College of Divinity and a PhD from the Chicago Theological Seminary. 

A former geophysicist, Drayton was ordained as a minister in 1969 in Kent Town, South Australia. He served as a minister in three congregations, Westbourne Park and Salisbury in South Australia and DePue, Illinois in the United States while writing his doctoral thesis. He then worked as a consultant for evangelism for the Synod of South Australia for five years followed by 16 years as the executive director of the Board of Mission in the Synod of New South Wales. He was the moderator of the New South Wales Synod (October 1995–October 1996) and had &quot;Pilgrim in the Cosmos&quot; published in 1996. During 1997, he spent time as a visiting professor in evangelism at the Southern Methodist University&#x27;s Perkins School of Theology in Dallas, Texas. In 1999 he was appointed a lecturer in theology (missiology and evangelism) at the United Theological College in Sydney, where he is a member of the adjunct faculty (2010).

Drayton has been a member of the UCA Assembly&#x27;s National Mission and Evangelism Committee from 1985 to 1998 and a member of the standing committee from 1985 until 2009. He has travelled widely in Australia practicing evangelism and mission, worked extensively with the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress and with the NSW Synod Pacific Island Council and Synod Korean Advisory Council.

Drayton was President of the Uniting Church in Australia from July 2003 to July 2006 at a time when there was controversy over the church&#x27;s position on male and female homosexual Christians, particularly clergy, and took a conciliatory leadership role.

Drayton is the author of &quot;Pilgrim in the Cosmos&quot; (1996) and &quot;Which Gospel?&quot; (2005), as well as other studies and articles on mission, evangelism and the contemporary mission context.

<text>The Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique were a light cavalry corps of chasseurs in the French Armée d&#x27;Afrique (Army of Africa). First raised in 1831 from regular French cavalry posted to Algeria, they numbered five regiments by World War II. For most of their history they were recruited from either French volunteers or French settlers in North Africa doing their military service. As such they were the mounted equivalent of the French Zouave infantry. The other major cavalry element in the Armee d&#x27;Afrique were the Spahis—recruited from the indigenous peoples of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco with mostly French officers.

==History==
First raised in 1831, shortly after the French occupation of Algiers, the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (&quot;Chass. d&#x27;Af.&quot; in common vernacular) were created through transfers from the &quot;chasseurs à cheval&quot;, other metropolitan cavalry regiments and some infantry units. Initially about 40 members of each squadron were locally recruited indigenous horsemen. Two additional regiments were created in 1832 and 1833 respectively, while the Arab and Berber troopers were transferred to the newly organised Spahis in 1836.

In addition to numerous campaigns in North Africa, these colorful regiments also served in the Crimean War, Second Italian War of Independence, Franco-Prussian War, Indochina, France&#x27;s invasion of Mexico, Dahomey (1892), Madagascar (1895) and both world wars. The 1st and 4th Regiments of &quot;Chass. d&#x27;Af.&quot; distinguished themselves by securing the flank of Lord Cardigan during the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. On this and other occasions they used their characteristic African tactic of advancing rapidly in open order, in contrast to the rigid lines of the Light Brigade.

On 5 May 1863 the 1st Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique distinguished itself in a clash with Mexican lancers during the Battle of San Pablo del Monte. The regimental flag was subsequently decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honour, the first French cavalry regiment to receive this distinction. 5 May remains the annual day of celebration for the modern &quot;Chass. d&#x27;Af.&quot;
All four of the regiments then in existence participated in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, with only depot squadrons remaining in Algeria. They suffered heavy casualties in a series of charges at the Battle of Sedan. Drawing on reservists and volunteers it was possible to reconstitue three provisional regiments, two of which continued to fight on as part of the new Republican armies.

==World War I==

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, six regiments of Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique were in existence. The 1er and 2e RCA had detached squadrons on active service in eastern Morocco while the four remaining regiments were on garrison duty in Algeria and Tunisia. Seven regiments of Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (including three marching regiments) were transferred to France between 1914 and 1918.

Four squadrons were present during the Gallipoli campaign with the &quot;Corps Expéditionnaire d&#x27;Orient&quot;, the unit being renamed as the 8th Marching Regiment of Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique on 29 July 1915. Two squadrons of the 1er and 4e RCA ended the war in the Middle East fighting against the Turks as part of the 5th Light Horse Brigade, while the 5e RCA detached squadrons to serve in the Balkans.

==Mechanisation==

In 1933 the &quot;regiments de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot; (RCA) began the process of conversion to mechanised units. The first vehicles adopted were White TBC armoured cars, followed by White-Laffly 50 AMs. Both models were obsolete for European warfare but suitable for colonial campaigning. Other vehicles were provided for individual squadrons and in 1939 Hotchkiss H35 and H39 light tanks were received by the 1er RCA.

On the outbreak of World War II (September 1939) regiments of chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique were deployed as follows:

* 1er RCA in Morocco;
* 2e, 3e, and 5e RCA in Algeria;
* 4e RCA in Tunisia;

Only the 1er and 4e RCA were fully mechanised at this date, the other regiments comprising a mix of mounted and mechanised squadrons.

In 1941, 6e and 7e RCA were created in the Levant, that is in Syria and Lebanon. Both were involved in heavy fighting against Allied forces in 1941 Operation Exporter, equipped with 90 tanks (mostly Renault R-35 with a few Renault FTs) and a similar number of armoured cars.

In the course of World War II the process of mechanisation was completed. The 3e and 5e RCA were equipped with M4 Sherman and M5 light tanks. The 5e RCA notably landed in Provence in August 1944, and was one of the first units to be fully operational for combat. It was engaged in several battles during the taking of Toulon, in the Rhone valley, through Burgundy, Alsace, and in the Black Forest. The regiment earned the Rhine and Danube badge.

The dissolution dates for the individual regiments were:

* 2e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique
* 4e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique
* :fr:5e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique
* :fr:6e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique
* :fr:7e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (1914-16, 1940-63)
* :fr:8e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (stationed in Tunisia after the Second World War, became &quot;8e régiment inter-armes de Bizerte&quot; 1961, dissolved 1963).
* :fr:9e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (1941-1959)
* :fr:10e groupe autonome des chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (June 1941-1943)
* :fr:11e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (1941-October 1961)

==Modern regiment==
Algerian independence brought an end to the corps through a series of disbandments and transfers between 1962 and 1964, after over a century of service. However one regiment (&quot;:fr:1er régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot;) was re-established in 1998 to preserve the force&#x27;s traditions. The modern regiment is one of the mechanised units of the French Army. Now stationed at Canjuers, it is divided into one instruction squadron and three combat squadrons and is equipped with approximately 45 armoured vehicles.

Two other training centers also have names associated with the 3rd and 12th Regiments.

Serving units today:
* 1er régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique at Canjuers Camp
* :fr:3e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique at Valdahon (training centre).
* :fr:12e régiment de chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique at Bitche, reformed 2019 as Centre de formation initiale de la 2e brigade blindée (training centre).

==Uniforms==

The Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique were until 1914 clothed in light blue tunics tucked into a red sash and red breeches. Their normal headdress was the &quot;taconnet&quot;—a light blue and red shako, similar in shape to that worn by the equivalent light cavalry regiments (hussars and chasseurs à cheval) of the metropolitan army, but worn with a white or light khaki cover. Prior to 1873 the casquette d&#x27;Afrique had been worn. The traditional fez and sash were worn off duty or when in barracks until World War II. The light blue tunics had yellow facings and reportedly earned the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique the nickname of &quot;Blue Butchers&quot; amongst some of their opponents.

From 1915, as was the case with other units of the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, a more practical khaki uniform was adopted for service. The khaki uniforms worn by the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique from 1915 onwards were distinguished by dark blue collar patches with yellow braiding and regimental numbers. The modern armoured regiment had by 2014 reintroduced the historic red sash, and on occasion the fez, for parade. More commonly worn is the light blue and red kepi of the French cavalry.

==American Civil War==
The name was also applied to the first all African-American regiment formed by the United States Army in New Orleans in 1862.
