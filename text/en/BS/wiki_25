<text>The Havana Conference was a conference held in the Cuban capital, Havana, from July 21 to July 30, 1940. At the meeting by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the United States, Panama, Mexico, Ecuador, Cuba, Costa Rica, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, Honduras, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and El Salvador agreed to collectively govern territories of nations that were taken over by the Axis powers of World War II and also declared that an attack on any nation in the region would be considered as an attack on all nations.

== Background ==
In the first years of World War II, as Germany began to take over countries throughout Europe, colonies of nations that were occupied, such as Netherlands and France, found themselves orphaned. They were therefore at risk of German occupation. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president of the United States, and his administration, saw this as a very credible threat, particularly as in the Caribbean were strategically positioned near major trade routes as well as the Panama Canal. At the Lima Conference of 1938, American nations agreed they would meet should a threat to the Western Hemisphere as a whole emerge. The Panama Conference which was called the following year and attending delegates had decided to hold another conference to discuss how to handle territories of European powers. Formally the Second Meeting of Consultation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics, such a conference was initially set for October 1940.

On June 17, 1940, the US moved the conference time up in response to a perceived increase in the situation&#x27;s urgency after the fall of France in 1940. Cordell Hull, the United States Secretary of State, planned to lead the Americans at the conference. Argentina, led by the conservative Ramón Castillo, was uncooperative and convinced various nations, notably Brazil and Chile, to withhold their foreign ministers from the conference. The reason they gave for this was that the ministers had much work to do, but historian Fredrick B. Pike writes that it was actually to avoid offending the Axis powers. As Hull prepared to attend the conference, he sought to expand the Export–Import Bank of the United States&#x27;s lending capacity dramatically, which he thought would ease negotiations. The United States Congress eventually partially granted his request.

== Conference ==
The conference was held from July 21 to July 30, 1940. The US had already publicly stated it would not accept transfer of territories to nations outside of the Americas, in a policy known as &quot;No Transfer&quot;. The delegation of the United States met resistance in their efforts from the Argentinian delegation. This resistance lessened after Roberto María Ortiz (the president of Argentina who was in ill health and had delegated his authority to Castillo) pressured the delegation to change tack. The US offered financial aid to countries present and an agreement was reached whereby territories of any European nation would be temporarily controlled by a &quot;Pan-American trusteeship&quot;. The agreement, however, still needed to be approved by a supermajority of American nations. The trusteeship would have one member from every American nation.

The &quot;Act of Havana&quot; further provided that if a European nation should fall before the agreement&#x27;s ratification, any of the countries could take over the relevant territories. The &quot;Declaration of Reciprocal Assistance and Cooperation for the Defense of the Nations of the Americas&quot; codified a one for all and all for one principle of American nations by stating that an attack on one country would be considered an attack on them all. This also provided for the creation of further pledges for mutual defense. 

This general sense of unity between nations meant that the United States had been broadly successful. The agreement to a &quot;no transfer doctrine&quot; codified an aspect of the Monroe Doctrine and expanded it to nations besides the United States.

== Reaction ==
Reaction to the ratification of the conference was met accusations of American imperialism from both the French and German press. Communist led labor groups in Mexico protested Mexico&#x27;s involvement at the conference seeing cooperation with the United States to be imperialist.

<doc id="540563" wikidata="Q1467621" url="?curid=540563" title="Martha and the Muffins">
<text>Martha and the Muffins are a Canadian rock band, active from 1977 to the present. Although they only had one major international hit single &quot;Echo Beach&quot; under their original band name, they had a number of hits in their native Canada, and the core members of the band also charted in Canada and internationally as M + M.

==Career==
===Formation and early years (1977–1978)===
The group&#x27;s initial line-up came together in Toronto in 1977, when David Millar asked his fellow Ontario College of Art student Mark Gane to help him start a band. Millar recruited Martha Johnson to play keyboards; Johnson brought in a friend from high school, Carl Finkle, to play bass; and Gane&#x27;s brother Tim signed on as the drummer. With Millar and Mark Gane as guitarists, and Johnson as lead vocalist, this is the line up that debuted at an Ontario College of Art Hallowe&#x27;en party in October 1977.

They chose the name &quot;Martha and the Muffins&quot; to distance themselves from the aggressive names adopted by many punk bands of the era. According to Mark Gane: &quot;We decided to use it as a temporary name until we could all agree on something better.&quot; The name ended up sticking for the next seven years.

Saxophone player Andy Haas began performing with the band in early 1978 (initially, as a guest artist). Founding-member Millar left the band shortly thereafter, preferring to work as the band&#x27;s sound engineer for live shows. He was replaced by Martha Ladly, who had attended high school with the Ganes. She became the group&#x27;s second keyboardist/vocalist named Martha, although Martha Johnson remained the group&#x27;s primary lead singer.

In 1978, they released their first independent single &quot;Insect Love&quot;. This and a demo tape recorded in June 1978 quickly garnered them a recording deal with the Dindisc offshoot of Virgin Records.

===International success (1979–1982)===
In 1979, the band travelled to England to record their first album &quot;Metro Music&quot;, which was released in 1980. The album was produced by Mike Howlett and recorded at The Manor Studios in Oxfordshire.

This album gave Martha and the Muffins a major international hit single with &quot;Echo Beach&quot;. Although the album did not spawn any further hits, &quot;Paint by Number Heart&quot; did get some airplay on Canadian radio while &quot;Saigon&quot; and a further single &quot;Suburban Dream&quot; were played on BBC Radio 1. In addition, both songs appeared on the American dance charts.

In October 1980, the band released their second album, &quot;Trance and Dance&quot;, which was less successful and did not give the band any hit singles. Ladly left the band after the album was recorded (but before it was released) to pursue an art scholarship. Jean Wilson briefly replaced Ladly on tour in the latter part of 1980, but never recorded with the group.

In 1981, bassist Finkle left the band and was replaced by Jocelyne Lanois, the sister of then-unknown record producer Daniel Lanois. After Jocelyne introduced the band to her brother, they figured Daniel was an ideal candidate to produce their next LP. However, in order to utilize his services as a co-producer, the band had to agree to Virgin Records&#x27; demand that, if they were going to insist on working with an unknown producer, they would also have to work with a lower recording budget.

Martha and the Muffins&#x27; 1981 album &quot;This Is the Ice Age&quot;, produced by Daniel Lanois and the band, was recorded in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario. More experimental than previous efforts, it also gained significant Canadian radio airplay from the singles &quot;Women Around the World at Work&quot; (a No. 24 hit in Canada, peaking on November 7 of the same year on the &quot;RPM&quot; national singles chart) and &quot;Swimming&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Tim Gane decided he did not want to tour, and left the band; he was replaced by new drummer Nick Kent.

Despite critical acclaim, &quot;This Is the Ice Age&quot; did not spin off any hit singles outside of Canada, and Virgin dropped the band from their roster.

===The M+M years (1983–1986)===
After the tour for &quot;This Is the Ice Age&quot;, Haas left the band over creative differences in a public spat carried out in the &quot;letters to the editor&quot; column of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;NOW&quot;. The band, now a quartet (Martha Johnson, Mark Gane, Jocelyne Lanois, and Nick Kent), signed to Canadian indie label Current Records, distributed by RCA.

1983&#x27;s &quot;Danseparc&quot; was produced by Daniel Lanois, Gane, and Johnson. Gane, eager to drop the name &quot;Martha and the Muffins&quot;, proposed that the group be now called &quot;M + M&quot;. In a compromise, both names were used for a time, and the &quot;Danseparc&quot; album cover had both &quot;M + M&quot; and &quot;Martha and the Muffins&quot; printed on it. Johnson would later explain that the name change just never stuck, because &quot;our legacy was Martha and the Muffins.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title track was another top 40 single in Canada and, for the &quot;Danseparc&quot; tour, the group was augmented by auxiliary players including guitarist Michael Brook. At the end of the tour, Gane and Johnson (now a couple) announced that, although they wanted to continue as a recording act, they also wanted to branch out in new directions by using new collaborators. In essence, Gane and Johnson decided that &quot;M + M&quot; was now Martha + Mark, along with studio musicians and sidemen.

The duo&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Mystery Walk&quot; was again co-produced by Daniel Lanois with Gane and Johnson, and it featured a large sticker crediting the band as &quot;M + M o/k/a Martha and the Muffins&quot;. Guest players included drummer Yogi Horton, bassist Tinker Barfield, and the Brecker Brothers on horns.

&quot;Mystery Walk&quot; album gave M + M/Martha and the Muffins their biggest hit in years with &quot;Black Stations/White Stations&quot;. The song was an anti-racist anthem whose first verse took radio stations to task for refusing to play a song about mixed-race romance, a story that Martha Johnson had heard related on the radio while driving in her car.

&quot;Black Stations/White Stations&quot; was a hit in Canada; in the United States, it reached no. 2 on the dance music charts, but was banned by many radio stations. &quot;Cooling the Medium&quot;, the second single, was also a significant hit in Canada.

In 1985, Johnson and Gane started work on their next album in Montreal before heading to Bath, England to work with producer David Lord, resulting in the album &quot;The World Is a Ball&quot; (1986). Although the lead single, &quot;Song in My Head&quot;, garnered them some airplay (and was another top 40 hit in Canada), the album sold poorly. Gane and Johnson spent some time living in England.

===Martha and the Muffins revived (1987–1992)===
Johnson and Gane took several years to record a follow-up to &quot;The World Is a Ball&quot;. Recording started in Bath, where the couple had moved to in 1987, and it continued in Toronto when they moved back to their home city in 1989. In 1992, they released the album &quot;Modern Lullaby&quot;. For these and all future releases, the duo revived the name &quot;Martha and the Muffins&quot;, although the only other original Muffin to participate in the making of this album was Tim Gane (on &quot;additional percussion&quot;). The lead single &quot;Rainbow Sign&quot; made RPM&#x27;s &quot;CanCon to Watch&quot; chart at no. 4 but did not cross over into the top 100, and the parent album similarly failed to chart. The same year, Martha and the Muffins contributed a cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Shades of Scarlett Conquering&quot; for the Mitchell tribute album &quot;Back to the Garden&quot;.

In 1992, Johnson and Gane&#x27;s daughter Eve was born. After the disappointing sales of &quot;Modern Lullaby&quot;, and a new family situation to consider, Johnson and Gane essentially shut down the band and moved to other projects for the next several years.

===Side projects and reunions (1993–2008)===
In 1995, Johnson released an album of children&#x27;s music entitled &quot;Songs from the Tree House&quot;. Credited simply to &quot;Martha&quot;, the album was an M+M/Martha and the Muffins project in all but name, as the record was written, arranged and produced by Gane and Johnson. &quot;Songs from the Tree House&quot; won a 1996 Juno Award for best children&#x27;s album.

In 1998, Johnson and Gane recorded a single new bonus track (&quot;Resurrection&quot;) for the 1998 Martha and the Muffins/M+M compilation album &quot;Then Again: A Retrospective&quot;. The following year, another new Martha and the Muffins recording (&quot;Do You Ever Wonder?&quot;) appeared on a various-artists compilation called &quot;The World According to Popguru&quot;.

In May 1999, Martha and the Muffins performed a live version of &quot;Echo Beach&quot; on the show &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot;. In addition to Mark Gane and Martha Johnson, the band included Jocelyne Lanois and another Gane brother, Nick.

In 2003, the Johnson/Gane duo (augmented by session players) performed at the CFNY Reunion as Martha and the Muffins. Then in 2005, they performed a number of reunion shows in Toronto, including a double bill with the also-reunited Parachute Club on 14 May. A later concert that year also included Jocelyne Lanois on guitar. However, no other former Martha and the Muffins members participated in these 2005 &#x27;reunion&#x27; shows, which were the first full-length Martha and the Muffins concerts since 1987. Around this time, one of their later songs, &quot;Paradise&quot;, became popularized when the Canadian TV show &quot;Paradise Falls&quot; used the song as its closing-credits theme.

In 2007/2008, Martha and the Muffins had both &quot;This Is the Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Danseparc&quot; reissued on CD. The latter was billed as &quot;Danseparc: 25th Anniversary Edition&quot;, and was digitally remastered by Peter J. Moore. Both albums featured bonus tracks.

===&quot;Delicate&quot; (2010)===
In June 2008, Martha and the Muffins began work on a new album, to be called &quot;Delicate&quot;, in collaboration with producer David Bottrill. In December 2009, the first single from the album &quot;Mess&quot; was made available on YouTube. The album was released on February 2, 2010, on their own label Muffin Music. It was Martha and the Muffins&#x27; first album of new material in 18 years.

Two additional non-album singles were also released in 2010. The first was a new acoustic studio version of &quot;Echo Beach&quot;, dubbed the &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot;. It was released digitally as well as on a physical CD, in both cases with the additional bonus track &quot;Big Day&quot;.

Towards the end of 2010, the band issued the digital-only holiday single &quot;Santa&#x27;s Gift of Love&quot;.

===Martha Johnson: &quot;Solo One&quot; (2013)===
In early 2013, Martha Johnson announced she would be recording a solo album, and raised money for the recording using Kickstarter. The album &quot;Solo One&quot; was billed as her solo debut, even though she previously had released a solo kids album. Johnson&#x27;s M+M/Muffins partner Mark Gane was involved in every stage of the album, co-producing all 11 tracks, playing on nine, and co-writing seven. Other contributors to the album, which was released in the autumn of 2013, included Ron Sexsmith and Ray Dillard.

===Recent activity (2020)===
After another long layoff from being an active performing entity, Martha and the Muffins released a video and downloadable song in May 2020 called &quot;Stay Home and Dance&quot;. A reworking of the 1984 M+M track &quot;Come Out and Dance&quot;, the new song and video was released in response to the stay-at-home orders surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021 they released the compilation &quot;Marthology: In and Outtakes&quot;, collecting rarities and demo versions of past songs. At the same time they indicated that they were working on a new album, tentatively slated for release in 2022.

<doc id="540570" wikidata="Q2349934" url="?curid=540570" title="Wise old man">
<text>The wise old man (also called senex, [[Wise old man|sage]] or [[Wise old man|sophos]]) is an archetype as described by Carl Jung, as well as a classic literary figure, and may be seen as a stock character. The wise old man can be a profound philosopher distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.

== Traits ==
This character is typically represented as a kind and wise elderly father figure who uses personal knowledge of people and the world to help tell stories and offer guidance that may in a mystical way impress upon his audience a sense of who they are and who they might become, thereby acting as a mentor. He may occasionally appear as an absent-minded professor, seeming absent-minded due to a predilection for contemplative pursuits.

The wise old man is often seen to be from a different culture, nation, or occasionally time, from those he advises. In extreme cases, he may be a liminal being, such as Merlin, who was only half human.

In medieval chivalric romance and modern fantasy literature, he is often presented as a wizard. He can also or instead be featured as a hermit. This character type often explained to the knights or heroes—particularly those searching for the Holy Grail—the significance of their encounters.

In storytelling, a few times the character of the wise old man is in some way removed for a time in order to allow the hero/heroine to develop on his/her own.

== Jungian psychology ==

In Jungian analytical psychology, senex is the specific term used in association with this archetype. In ancient Rome, the title of Senex (Latin for &quot;old man&quot;) was only awarded to elderly men with families who had good standing in their village; the title senator derives from this. Examples of the senex archetype in a positive form include the wise old man or wizard.

In Jungian individuation process, the archetype of the wise old man was late to emerge, and seen as an indication of the Self: &quot;If an individual has wrestled seriously enough and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem...the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form...as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian &quot;guru&quot;), a wise old man, a spirit of nature, and so forth&#x27;.

The antithetical archetype, or enantiodromic opposite, of the senex is the Puer Aeternus.

==In religion==
===Judaism and Christianity===
Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Methuselah, Simeon, Joseph and Paul the Apostle and many others are considered wise old men in Judeo-Christian tradition. The basic sentence of the New Testament and Old Testament gerontology, which is equally binding for the Jewish and for the Christian religion, is: A long and fulfilling life is a gift from God. Those who die &quot;old and full of life&quot; are happy. In the Books of Moses a long life is promised, among other things, to those who honor father and mother and who do not use false weights.

Many attitudes toward old age in the Western world have origins in the Old Testament and New Testament. Age has been associated with prudence, experience, insight and wisdom, but also weaknesses such as declining physical health and sensory performance. Biblical references state that although wisdom is a gift of old age, even the elderly are not protected against youthful folly and that &quot;gray hair is a splendid crown / one finds it on the path of righteousness.&quot;

As a child, Jesus debated religious issues side by side with wise elders.

== Cultural references ==

In fiction, a wise old man is often presented in the form of a wizard or other magician in medieval chivalric romance and modern fantasy literature and films, in the style of Merlin. Notable examples include Gandalf from &quot;The Hobbit and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Albus Dumbledore from &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and Obi-Wan Kenobi from &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

&quot;Senex&quot; is the name of a wise old character in the novel &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot; by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle.

Around the 1850s, the antiquarian Robert Reid used the pseudonym &quot;Senex&quot; when contributing articles on local history in the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;. These were later published in a series of volumes. Sir Alan Lascelles used the penname &quot;Senex&quot; when writing to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1950 setting out the so-called Lascelles Principles concerning the monarch&#x27;s right to refuse a prime minister&#x27;s request for a general election.

<doc id="540571" wikidata="Q824214" url="?curid=540571" title="Wernicke's area">
<text>Wernicke&#x27;s area (; ), also called Wernicke&#x27;s speech area, is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex that are linked to speech, the other being Broca&#x27;s area. It is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language, in contrast to Broca&#x27;s area, which is primarily involved in the production of language. It is traditionally thought to reside in Brodmann area 22, located in the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right-handed individuals and 70% of left-handed individuals.

Damage caused to Wernicke&#x27;s area results in receptive, fluent aphasia. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike non-fluent aphasia, in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, telegraphic manner.

Emerging research on the developmental trajectory of Wernicke&#x27;s area highlights its evolving role in language acquisition and processing during childhood. This includes studies on the maturation of neural pathways associated with this region, which contribute to the progressive complexity of language comprehension and production abilities in developing individuals.

==Structure==
Wernicke&#x27;s area, more precisely defined, spans the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and extends to involve adjacent areas like the angular gyrus and parts of the parietal lobe reflecting a more intricate neuroanatomical network than previously understood. This area shows considerable variability in its exact location and extent among individuals, challenging the traditional view of a uniformly located language center.

However, there is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location. Some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex (the anterior part of BA 22). This is the site most consistently implicated in auditory word recognition by functional brain imaging experiments. Others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in BA 39 and BA40 in the parietal lobe. Despite the overwhelming notion of a specifically defined &quot;Wernicke&#x27;s Area&quot;, the most careful current research suggests that it is not a unified concept.

While previously thought to connect Wernicke&#x27;s area and Broca&#x27;s area, new research demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus instead connects to posterior receptive areas with premotor/motor areas, and not to Broca&#x27;s area. Consistent with the word recognition site identified in brain imaging, the uncinate fasciculus connects anterior superior temporal regions with Broca&#x27;s area.

Research using Transcranial magnetic stimulation suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke&#x27;s area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words—such as &quot;river&quot; when given the ambiguous word &quot;bank&quot;. In contrast, the Wernicke&#x27;s area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (&quot;teller&quot; given &quot;bank&quot;).

===Modern views===
Emerging research, including advanced neuroimaging studies, underscores a more distributed network of brain regions involved in language processing, challenging the traditional dichotomy of Wernicke&#x27;s and Broca&#x27;s areas. This includes findings on how Wernicke&#x27;s area collaborates with other brain regions in processing both verbal and non-verbal auditory information, reshaping our understanding of its functional significance.

Support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study carried out at the University of Rochester in which American Sign Language native speakers were subject to MRI while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of &quot;moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body&quot;). Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition. However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap. These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that Wernicke&#x27;s area plays a pivotal role in the nuanced aspects of language processing, including the interpretation of ambiguous words and the integration of linguistic context. Its functions extend beyond mere speech comprehension, encompassing complex cognitive tasks like semantic processing, discerning metaphorical language, and even contributing to the understanding of non-verbal elements in communication.

Comparative neurology studies have shed light on the evolutionary aspects of Wernicke&#x27;s area. Similar regions have been identified in non-human primates, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory for language and communication skills. This comparative approach helps in understanding the fundamental neurobiological underpinnings of language and its evolutionary significance.

==Clinical significance==
===Aphasia===

Wernicke&#x27;s area is named after Carl Wernicke, a German neurologist and psychiatrist who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words. He did this on the basis of the location of brain injuries that caused aphasia. Receptive aphasia in which such abilities are preserved is also known as Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal syntax. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called &quot;fluent&quot; or &quot;jargon aphasia&quot;).

Wernicke&#x27;s area receives information from the auditory cortex, and functions to assign word meanings. This is why damage to this area results in meaningless speech, often with paraphasic errors and newly created words or expressions. Paraphasia can involve substituting one word for another, known as semantic paraphasia, or substituting one sound or syllable for another, defined as phonemic paraphasia. This speech is often referred to as &quot;word salad&quot;, as speech sounds fluent but does not have sensible meaning. Normal sentence structure and prosody are preserved, with normal intonation, inflection, rate, and rhythm. This differs from Broca&#x27;s aphasia, which is characterized by nonfluency. Patients are typically not aware that their speech is impaired in this way, as they have altered comprehension of their speech. Written language, reading, and repetition are affected as well.

Damage to the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere is the cause of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia. The etiology of this damage can vary greatly, with the most common cause being a cerebrovascular event such as an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is the result of a thrombus occluding a blood vessel, restricting blood supply to a particular area of the brain. Other causes of focal damage potentially leading to Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia include head trauma, infections affecting the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease, and neoplasms. A cerebrovascular event is more likely the cause in an acute-onset presentation of aphasia, whereas a degenerative disease should be suspected in aphasia with gradual progression over time. Imaging is often useful in identifying a lesion, with most common initial imaging consisting of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Electroencephalography (EEG) can also be useful in patients with transient aphasia, where findings may be due to seizures, although this is a less common cause.

Diagnosis of aphasia, as well as characterization of type of aphasia, is done with language testing by the provider. Testing should evaluate fluency of speech, comprehension, repetition, ability to name objects, and writing skills. Fluency is assessed by observing the patient&#x27;s spontaneous speech. Abnormalities in fluency would include shortened phrases, decreased number of words per minute, increased effort with speech, and agrammatism. Patients with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia should have fluent speech, so abnormalities in fluency may indicate a different type of aphasia. Comprehension is assessed by giving the patient commands to follow, beginning with simple commands and progressing to more complex commands. Repetition is evaluated by having the patient repeat phrases, progressing from simple to more complex phrases. Both comprehension and repetition would be abnormal in Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia. Content should also be assessed, by listening to a patient&#x27;s spontaneous or instructed speech. Content abnormalities include paraphasic errors and neologisms, both indicative of a diagnosis of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia. Neologisms are novel words that may resemble existing words. Patients with severe Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia may also produce strings of such neologisms with a few connecting words, known as jargon. Errors in the selection of phonemes of patients with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia include addition, omission, or change in position. Another symptom of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is use of semantic paraphasias or &quot;empty speech&quot; which is the use of generic terms like &quot;stuff&quot; or &quot;things&quot; to stand in for the specific words that the patient cannot think of. Some Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia patients also talk around missing words, which is called &quot;circumlocution&quot;. Patients with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia can tend to run on when they talk, due to circumlocution combined with deficient self-monitoring. This overabundance of words or press of speech can be described as logorrhea. If symptoms are present, a full neurologic exam should also be done, which will help differentiate aphasia from other neurologic diagnoses potentially causing altered mental status with abnormal speech and comprehension.

As an example, a patient with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia was asked what brought him to the hospital. His response was,Is this some of the work that we work as we did before? ... All right ... From when wine [why] I&#x27;m here. What&#x27;s wrong with me because I ... was myself until the taenz took something about the time between me and my regular time in that time and they took the time in that time here and that&#x27;s when the time took around here and saw me around in it&#x27;s started with me no time and I bekan [began] work of nothing else that&#x27;s the way the doctor find me that way...In diagnosing Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, clinicians employ a range of assessments focusing on speech fluency, comprehension, and repetition abilities. Treatment strategies extend beyond traditional speech therapy, incorporating multimodal approaches like music therapy and assistive communication technologies. Understanding the variability in the clinical presentation of aphasia is critical for tailoring individualized therapeutic interventions.

While neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke&#x27;s area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language, and isolated damage of Wernicke&#x27;s area cortex (sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia. Even when patients with Wernicke&#x27;s area lesions have comprehension deficits, these are usually not restricted to language processing alone. For example, one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises. In fact, for Wernicke&#x27;s area, the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds.

<doc id="540573" wikidata="Q1010328" url="?curid=540573" title="Kilsyth">
<text>Kilsyth (; ) is a town and civil parish in North Lanarkshire, roughly halfway between Glasgow and Stirling in Scotland. The estimated population is 10,380. The town is famous for the Battle of Kilsyth and the religious revivals of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The town now has links with Cumbernauld at one time being part of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council. The towns also have the same members of parliament at Holyrood and Westminster.

==Location==
Historically part of Stirlingshire, Kilsyth is at an elevation of above sea level and occupies a narrow strip of land between the Kilsyth Hills to the north and the River Kelvin to the south. To the east and west it is bordered by marshland and bogs. The centre of the town is close to the confluence of the Garrell and Ebroch burns.

From earliest recorded times Kilsyth was one of the main routes between Glasgow, Falkirk and Edinburgh, and is very close to the Roman Antonine Wall, the Forth and Clyde Canal and the main Glasgow to Edinburgh railway line, with the nearest railway station at Croy. Formerly two separate stations existed in the town on separate, although linked, railway lines. One, the Kelvin Valley Railway went to Glasgow-Maryhill while the other, the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge railway, went via Banknock to Falkirk. The town occupies a sheltered position in the Kelvin Valley, and is bisected by the A803 between Kirkintilloch and Falkirk. The old drovers&#x27; road from Stirling, (the Tak Ma Doon Road), and the route south to Cumbernauld via Auchinstarry Bridge, intersect the A803 at Kilsyth. 
==History and development==

There is archaeological evidence of settlement since Neolithic times The Romans recognised the strategic significance of Kilsyth; the Antonine Wall forts of Bar Hill and Croy Hill are clearly visible from the present-day town. In the Middle Ages, Kilsyth held a key strategic position on one of the main routes across the narrowest part of Scotland. It was the site of two, now ruined, castles at Balcastle and Colzium. These were shown in Timothy Pont&#x27;s map of 1580 and can also been seen on Blaeu&#x27;s map which was derived from it. The town officially came into being in 1620 although a barony of Kilsyth preceded this. Regarding the name of the town, modern research into Kilsyth&#x27;s toponymy leads to different findings than earlier analysis.

The civil war Battle of Kilsyth took place on hillsides between Kilsyth and Banton in 1645. Kilsyth was later closely associated with the various attempts by the Jacobites to regain the crown. Bonnie Prince Charlie is reported to have spent the night in the town in January 1746. The battlefield is now under Banton Loch which is a largely artificial body of water used to feed the Forth and Clyde Canal, close to its highest elevation. The canal was cut through Dullatur Bog in 1769–1770 bringing economic benefit to Kilsyth. (It apparently disturbed many small toads which relocated by hopping northwards).

The area was in the ownership of the Livingstone family at the time of the Battle of Kilsyth. As a reward for his support, Sir James Livingstone was made Viscount of Kilsyth by King Charles II in 1661. By 1715, the Livingstones were supporting the Jacobite rebels, and had their estates confiscated. Later landowners were the Edmonstone family, who built Colzium House in 1783 and rebuilt it in 1861. It is now a museum in a public park. 

In 1826, Kilsyth was given burgh status, enabling it to have burgesses and a market. 

Historically the parish was known as Moniabrugh, or one of its variants, with its name changing sometime in the 18th century. The town economy has shifted over the past three centuries from dairy farming, handloom weaving, tambouring and extractive industries to light engineering, transport and service industries. Many of the townsfolk of working age now commute to work in larger towns or Glasgow.

==Religion and revivals==
Following its foundation as an early monastic settlement, the town has a long tradition of radical protestantism. John Livingstone described himself as being from Monyabrock, an old name for Kilsyth. The town was the scene of major revivals for example under the leadership of James Robe in 1742. William Hamilton Burns a minister in Kilsyth, and his son William Chalmers Burns a missionary to China also saw revival in 1839, part of the Second Great Awakening. William Irvine (evangelist and founder of the Two by Twos and Cooneyites sects) was born in Kilsyth in 1863. 

The Church of Scotland parish church was founded in 1768 and the present building was opened in 1893. Its first ministers were father and son, John Anderson (d.1862) and Robert Anderson (d.1907): in 1900, the church was named the Anderson church in their honour.

The formation of the new Church of God, the first Pentecostal Church in Scotland in 1902 led to further outbreaks of revival in 1908 and to Kilsyth becoming an early focus of Pentecostalism.

==Administration==
Kilsyth was originally part of the deanery of Lennox. The parish was called variously Monyabroch, Monaeburgh, or Moniabrocd, but part of the parish was called Kelvesyth by the beginnings of the 13th century. The lands passed through the hands of branches of the Callendar and Livingston families as their fortunes waxed and waned, eventually becoming the property of the Edmonstones. Kilsyth was established as a Burgh of Barony in 1620. A Town Charter was granted in 1826, permitting the holders of plots to elect a Town Council. It used to be part of Stirlingshire, but is now within North Lanarkshire jurisdiction.

In 2012, the multi-member ward was represented by three elected councillors; Jean Jones (Labour), Heather McVey (Labour) and Alan Stevenson (SNP). Jamie Hepburn MSP was elected as Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Scottish Parliament constituency) member of the Scottish Parliament on 5 May 2011 with a majority of 3459. Since May 2015, Stuart MacDonald has been Westminster MP for the Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (UK Parliament constituency). He is a member of the Scottish National Party. As he said in his maiden speech he has sometimes been mistaken for his namesake who is also an SNP MP.

Kilsyth Community Council, as the locally elected representative body, is an active community group but enjoys very limited powers.

Since 1995 Kilsyth has been part of North Lanarkshire. The arms of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council featured an open Bible and the shuttle and miner&#x27;s lamp. These symbols were taken from the earlier arms of Kilsyth. However the open Bible and the miner&#x27;s lamp were the only symbols which were carried on to the North Lanarkshire coat of arms.

==Attractions and events==
Kilsyth has many of the elements associated with a Scottish market town, including a pedestrianised Main Street with a wide range of local and specialist independent shops, attractive parks and gardens at Burngreen and Colzium complete with bandstands, welcoming hostelries such as the Coachman Hotel, the Boathouse and the Scarecrow pub, and a fair choice of local restaurants - European, Indian, Chinese, and fish &amp; chips. The nearby villages of Croy, Banton, Queenzieburn, and Twechar are within easy walking distance from Kilsyth.

Townhead reservoir, known locally as Banton Loch, is the site of the Battle of Kilsyth and is the main reservoir for the Forth and Clyde Canal. A thriving marina has been developed at Auchinstarry close to the climbing wall and lakes at the old quarry.

Kilsyth Lennox Golf Club was founded in 1899. The original nine-hole course was the Balmalloch area of the town, but moved in 1905 to the present position North East of the town. Between 1997 and 2002, the majority of the greens and tees were redesigned by Rocky Roquemore, the American Golf Course architect. The club hosts a Festival of Golf in the first week in July.

Kilsyth has a public swimming pool, open seven days a week, a public library, a small cottage hospital and health centre, and a range of recreational facilities such as tennis courts and bowling clubs. A feature of Burngreen Park is a children&#x27;s road safety attraction with a model road layout and bikes, etc. for hire. It is also an accredited Walkers are Welcome town.

Nearby attractions include the Falkirk Wheel, a huge boat lift that connects the Union and Forth &amp; Clyde Canal networks, and the Antonine Wall – marking the northern edge of the Roman Empire. Kilsyth is about 30 minutes from Glasgow, 15 minutes from Falkirk, 30 minutes from Stirling and 45 minutes from Edinburgh by car, bus (new express link in 2011) or train from nearby Croy station.

Kilsyth held an international carnival in mid-August – in 2007 this was held on Sunday August 12 and headlined the Peatbog Faeries and David Sneddon. It is held in the grounds of the wooded Colzium estate nearby. Following a two-year break, the carnival was relaunched in mid-August 2010 as a multi-day music, comedy and dance festival under the banner of the BIG KIC headlining Salsa Celtica, Dougie MacLean and Fred MacAulay. However this event is no longer held

Civic Week festivities are held in June each year, with the traditional crowning of the Civic Queen. The festival features a variety of cultural and sports activities usually featuring members of clubs/groups from the town. A Christmas Festival is held annually, supported by the Rotary Club of Kilsyth.

The town is well represented on the football front, being the home of Kilsyth Rangers F.C. who are the local junior team, and there are two amateur teams - Kilsyth United AFC &amp; Kilsyth Amateurs. There is also the Golden Gloves Boxing Club and many other groups and organisations. Kilsyth has three primary schools: Kilsyth Primary and Balmalloch Primary, and St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School (Roman Catholic). Children from each school can progress to Kilsyth Academy while children from St Patrick&#x27;s Primary generally advance to St. Maurice&#x27;s High School located in nearby Cumbernauld. Kilsyth Academy is situated on Corrie Road and hosts a range of functions throughout the year.

<doc id="540586" wikidata="Q3168526" url="?curid=540586" title="John Paul Harney">
<text>John Paul Ludger Harney, also known as Jean-Paul Harney, (February 2, 1931 – October 4, 2021) was a Canadian professor and former politician.

==Academic life==

After completing his M.A. at Queen&#x27;s University in 1961, he became an assistant professor of English at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario, and taught there until 1966. He was also a poet, and gave readings at the Guelph Public Library. In 1970, he became a humanities professor at York University, and a professor of Canadian studies until 1998.

==Political career==

Harney ran as a candidate for the New Democratic Party throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

From 1962 to 1965, he stood as a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in Wellington South. After moving to Toronto, he then stood once more as a candidate in Scarborough West in the 1968 federal election. He won a seat in the House of Commons in the 1972 federal election, but was defeated in 1974. He continued to campaign in subsequent elections there up to 1980. In addition, he sought the NDP nomination in the 1978 federal byelection for Broadview, but lost out to Bob Rae.

He was the Provincial Secretary for the Ontario New Democratic Party from 1966 to 1970. In that time, he was also the campaign manager for that party&#x27;s breakthrough campaign in the 1967 general election.

He campaigned to become national leader at the NDP&#x27;s 1971 leadership convention, coming in third behind winner David Lewis and runner-up James Laxer. He stood as a candidate again at the 1975 leadership convention, where he got as far as the second ballot, coming in fourth. In 1981, he became involved in party debates concerning the forthcoming adoption of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, arguing that it was silent about labour rights to organize, strike and bargain.

Born in Quebec and fluently bilingual, Harney returned to the province and became leader of the Quebec wing of the federal NDP in 1984. He continued to teach at York University, while living in Sillery. He led the relaunching of the New Democratic Party of Quebec as a provincial party in 1985 but was unable to win a seat either in the federal House of Commons (running in Lévis in two elections) or in the Quebec National Assembly (running in Louis-Hébert). During this time, he francized his name to &quot;Jean-Paul&quot;.

Late in the 1988 federal election campaign, he called a press conference to support using the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Constitution to protect Quebec&#x27;s francophone culture and restrict the use of other languages. This press conference was not endorsed by the NDP leadership, and many believe that it cost the party support among Quebec&#x27;s anglophones. He stepped down later that year. Although he favoured the Bloc Québécois position on Quebec sovereignty, he refused to consider becoming one of its candidates as long as it pursued independence from Canada.

Harney later retired to Prince Edward County, Ontario, and was involved in promoting local causes. He died in Picton, Ontario on October 4, 2021.

<doc id="540593" wikidata="Q5519816" url="?curid=540593" title="Game Axe">
<text>The Game Axe is an unlicensed handheld version of the Famicom, made by the Taiwanese hardware manufacturer Legend Technology Co., LTD. Launched in 1989 it made a comeback around 2000, being sold in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan under the Redant brand. It is a portable Famiclone that can play Famicom games, and by using the included adapter, American and European Nintendo Entertainment System games.

==Design==
The design of the Game Axe was horizontal and similar in appearance to Sega&#x27;s Game Gear. It had a 3.5-inch (model FC-812) or 4-inch (models FC-816/FC-868) colour LCD screen, two controller ports at the base, an AC jack, and an RCA jack, allowing the Game Axe to be plugged to a television and essentially replace a Famicom.

=== Technical specifications ===
These are the basic technical specifications for the Game Axe:

* Power: 9 volts DC 500-1000mA / 6 AA batteries.
* CPU: NMOS 6502 at 1.8 MHz
* Graphics: PPU (Picture Processing Unit)
* Display: 3.8 inch Passive Matrix LCD screen with backlight. 
* Sound: pAPU (pseudo-Audio Processing Unit)
* Connectors: 
** DC in, cartridge slot, A/V Out, RCA A/V in (component video Y-cable connecting to 1/8” mini jack)
** Controllers
** A/V Out (using standard Sega Genesis A/V out cord)
** Phones

===Issues with the NES cartridge adapter===
Due to the necessity of an extra adapter, the Game Axe suffers severe stability issues if playing NES games while holding the device. Any jarring of the hand held causes NES games to lose enough contact to freeze or shut off.

<text>In cognitive linguistics and artificial intelligence, conceptual blending, also called conceptual integration or view application, is a theory of cognition developed by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner. According to this theory, elements and vital relations from diverse scenarios are &quot;blended&quot; in a subconscious process, which is assumed to be ubiquitous to everyday thought and language. Much like memetics, it is an attempt to create a unitary account of the cultural transmission of ideas.

==History==
The development of this theory began in 1993 and a representative early formulation is found in the online article &quot;Conceptual Integration and Formal Expression&quot;. Turner and Fauconnier cite Arthur Koestler&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;The Act of Creation&quot; as an early forerunner of conceptual blending: Koestler had identified a common pattern in creative achievements in the arts, sciences and humor that he had termed &quot;bisociation of matrices.&quot; A newer version of blending theory, with somewhat different terminology, was presented in Turner and Fauconnier&#x27;s 2002 book, &quot;The Way We Think&quot;. Conceptual blending, in the Fauconnier and Turner formulation, is one of the theoretical tools used in George Lakoff and Rafael Núñez&#x27;s &quot;Where Mathematics Comes From&quot;, in which the authors assert that &quot;understanding mathematics requires the mastering of extensive networks of metaphorical blends.&quot;

==Computational models==
Conceptual blending is closely related to frame-based theories, but goes beyond these primarily in that it is a theory of how to &quot;combine&quot; frames (or frame-like objects). An early computational model of a process called &quot;view application&quot;, which is closely related to conceptual blending (which did not exist at the time), was implemented in the 1980s by Shrager at Carnegie Mellon University and PARC, and applied in the domains of causal reasoning about complex devices and scientific reasoning. More recent computational accounts of blending have been developed in areas such as mathematics. Some later models are based upon structure mapping, which did not exist at the time of the earlier implementations. Recently, within the context of non-monotonic extensions of AI reasoning systems (and in line with the frame-based theories), a general framework able to account for both complex human-like concept combinations (like the PET-FISH problem) and conceptual blending has been tested and developed in both cognitive modelling and computational creativity applications.

==Philosophical status of the theory==
In his book &quot;The Literary Mind&quot;, conceptual blending theorist Mark Turner states that Conceptual blending is a fundamental instrument of the everyday mind, used in our basic construal of all our realities, from the social to the scientific.

Insights obtained from conceptual blends constitute the products of creative thinking, however conceptual blending theory is not itself a complete theory of creativity, inasmuch as it does not illuminate the issue of where the inputs to a blend originate. In other words, conceptual blending provides a terminology for describing creative products, but has little to say on the matter of inspiration.

==Network model==
===Characteristics of blending===

As described by Fauconnier and Turner, mental spaces are small conceptual containers used to structure processes behind human reasoning and communication. They are constantly created as people think and talk to serve a specific purpose depending on the context. The basic form of integration network consists of at least four separate and interconnected spaces which can be modified at any moment as a discourse progresses. Fauconnier and Turner also suggest that mental spaces are generated in working memory and are connected to the knowledge stored in long-term memory. Elements present in mental spaces are said to resemble the activation of corresponding groups of neurons.

Different types of mental spaces proposed are:
*Generic space – captures a common structure which is present in all input spaces 
*Input space – provides the contents of a specific situation or idea 
*Blended space – contains a general structure from a generic space as well as some elements from input spaces chosen and mapped onto this space through selective projection 

Cross-space mapping of counterparts represents various types of connections, such as metaphoric connections, between matching structures in the input spaces.

In some of the more complex cases of integration networks, there are multiple input and blended spaces.

===Blending===

The process of blending results in the creation of an emergent structure in the blended space. This new structure, which is not found directly in any of the input spaces, is necessary to achieve a particular goal. The emergent structure is generated through the three following operations: 
*Composition – provides relations between elements which are only observable by composing together elements from separate input spaces
*Completion – passes on to the blending space additional meaning which is associated with elements in input spaces
*Elaboration – represents the idea of dynamically running the blend as if it was a simulation 

Selective projection refers to the observation that not everything from the input spaces is projected to the blend.

===Example of a blend – Buddhist monk===

To illustrate how the blend works, Fauconnier and Turner present the riddle of the Buddhist monk, which was originally discussed by Arthur Koestler in his book &quot;The Act of Creation&quot; (1964): 

A Buddhist monk begins at dawn one day walking up a mountain, reaches the top at sunset, meditates at the top for several days until one dawn when he begins to walk back to the foot of the mountain, which he reaches at sunset. Making no assumptions about his starting or stopping or about his pace during the trips, prove that there is a place on the path which he occupies at the same hour of the day on the two separate journeys.

Solving the problem requires imagining the scenario in which the monk simultaneously goes up and down the mountain on the same day. Although this situation is fictional and improbable, it can still lead to the solution. With the problem described in this new way, it is easy now to understand that there must be a place and time when the monk meets himself during his journey. This &quot;meeting&quot; provides the proof that there is a place on the path asked for in the riddle. 
A scenario in which the monk goes up one day is represented in this case as a one input space, whereas the day he goes down is the second input. The connection between the monk in one input space and the monk in the other input space is considered as an example of cross-space mapping. The generic space includes, for instance, the mountain path as it is the common element present in both inputs.
The blended space is where the integration happens. Whereas some elements, such as the day and the mountain’s path, are combined and mapped onto the blended space as one, other elements, such as monks, are projected separately. Because the projection preserved the time of a day and the monk’s motion’s direction during projection, there are two separate monks in the blend. In this space, it is also possible to “run” the new structure leading to the monk’s meeting with himself.

===Four main types of integration network===

====Simplex==== 

In a simplex network, one of the input spaces contains organising frames, and the other includes specific elements. In this type of integration network, the roles associated with the frame from one input space are projected onto the blended space together with the values as elements from the other input space. Then they are integrated into a new structure.

====Mirror====

A mirror network is characterised by a shared organising frame present in each of the mental spaces. The Buddhist Monk riddle is an example of this network.
====Single-scope====

A single-scope network consists of two input spaces which have different organising frames. In this situation, only one frame is projected into the blended space. 

====Double-scope====

In a double-scope network, there are two different organising frames in input spaces, and the blended space contains parts of each of those frames from both input spaces.

===Vital relations===

Vital relations describe some of the connections between the elements of the different input spaces. For example, in the Buddhist Monk riddle, time is treated as a vital relation which is compressed in the blended space, and as a result, the monk can simultaneously walk up and down the mountain. Some of the other types of vital relations include cause-effect, change, space, identity, role and part-whole.

==Criticism==
The main criticism against the conceptual blending theory was proposed by Raymond W. Gibbs Jr. (2000), who pointed out the lack of testable hypotheses which are necessary if the theory is to predict any behaviour. He has explained that the blending theory cannot be treated as a single theory but rather as a framework. However, because there is no one fundamental hypothesis to test, many various hypotheses should be tested instead which can be problematic for the theory. Gibbs has also suggested that inferring information about language processes from the analysis of the products of these processes may not be a correct approach. Furthermore, he has proposed that other linguistic theories are equally effective in explaining the various cognitive phenomena. These criticisms were answered directly by Fauconnier.

The theory has also been criticised for unnecessary complexity. The minimal network model requires at least four mental spaces; however, David Ritchie (2004) argues that many of the proposed blends could be explained by simpler integration processes. He has also argued that some examples of blends such as the Buddhist Monk may have an alternative interpretation.

<text>Joseph John Comartin (born December 26, 1947) is a retired Canadian lawyer and politician. He represented the riding of Windsor—Tecumseh as its Member of Parliament (MP) from 2000 to 2015. A member of the New Democratic Party (NDP), he ran for its leadership in 2003. He called for a return to social democratic policies after the party&#x27;s drift to the centre during the 1990s, and voiced concerns regarding American influence over Canada&#x27;s economy and foreign policy. After serving in a variety of leadership roles, he retired from parliament in 2015. From 2018 to 2022 he served as the Consul General of Canada in Detroit, representing Canada in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio.

==Early life and legal career==
Joseph John &quot;Joe&quot; Comartin was born on December 26, 1947, in Stoney Point, Ontario, a small Franco-Ontarian community. He was the seventh and youngest child of Emery and Loretto (née Quirk) Comartin. His older siblings were Lucille, Agnes, Rosemary, Alice, Kathleen, and Edward. Emery was a French American born in North Dakota. Emery wandered the Midwestern United States during the Great Depression, eventually settling in Detroit after getting a job there as an autoworker. Loretto was an Irish Canadian from London, Ontario who moved to Detroit to care for her sick aunt. The two met through Detroit&#x27;s Irish American community and married. Emery continued to work in Detroit, but the family also purchased a plot of land to farm in Stoney Point.

Emery died of stomach cancer when Joe was a year old and when Loretto was pregnant with an eighth child, who was named Emery after his father. Following the senior Emery&#x27;s death, Loretto began teaching at an elementary school to supplement meager social assistance, financial support from family, and charity from the local community. She later remarried to Adelard Gagnon, a car salesman from Belle River, Ontario.

Comartin developed an early love for reading as a child, and he often read while in the branches of an apple tree. During his education he often had to work two or three jobs at a time to help support his family, with his first job being at a grocery store in Belle River. Comartin attended F.J. Brennan Catholic High School in Windsor, Ontario. At his mother&#x27;s urging Comartin originally intended to become a priest, but at 16 he decided that he did not want to be celibate. Instead, he decided he wanted to become a lawyer, believing it to be a similar form of public service. While at Brennan, Comartin was elected the eleventh grade male representative on the student council. He was appointed as the male representative on the school&#x27;s awards committee after the twelfth grade male representative proved unable to fill the role. The twelfth grade female representative was Comartin&#x27;s future wife, Maureen Granger. Granger was already in a relationship at the time, and she and Comartin did not begin dating until a few years later. Comartin was elected student president in his final year at Brennan.

Following his high school graduation Comartin attended the University of Windsor, where he completed an undergraduate in political science in 1968, and law school in 1971. Unlike most of his older siblings, Comartin was able to attend university because of the creation of the Canada Student Loan Program. While at university Comartin was an engaged student activist; he attended a student strike where he briefly met then-Member of Provincial Parliament Hugh Peacock, and was a founding member of the Windsor chapter of the Canadian Environmental Law Association.

Two years after completing law school, Comartin established a private legal practice in Windsor. During this time, he specialised in civil litigation and representing low-income women in family law cases. In the late 1970s, Comartin sued brake manufacturer Bendix on behalf of widow Lucie Dunn to have her husband&#x27;s death by mesothelioma recognised as a compensable injury.

In 1984, Comartin left his private legal practice to become a lawyer for the Windsor branch of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) and the managing director of its legal services.

==Political activism==
The Comartin family had traditionally supported the Liberal Party, especially prominent local member Paul Martin Sr. At the encouragement of his sister, Comartin joined the Liberal Party and campaigned for her friend Mark MacGuigan in the 1968 Canadian federal election, in which Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was elected for the first time. Despite his initial support, Comartin quickly grew to dislike Trudeau for his arrogance, and he switched parties to the NDP the next year after concluding they better aligned with his values. Comartin went on to become heavily involved with the regional riding associations of the NDP and Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP).

In 1981, Comartin was appointed co-chair of the Mayor&#x27;s Committee on Services for the Unemployed by Bert Weeks.

Following Weeks&#x27; retirement, Comartin worked as the campaign manager for Elizabeth Kishkon&#x27;s successful bid to succeed him in the 1982 Windsor municipal election. Comartin also campaigned for city alderman Howard McCurdy&#x27;s successful bid to be elected MP for Windsor—Walkerville in the 1984 Canadian federal election. After McCurdy&#x27;s election, there was a controversy over whether his replacement as city alderman would be appointed or if a by-election would be held. Comartin was considered a contender to replace McCurdy, but ultimately former mayor Michael J. Patrick was appointed instead. Comartin was the ONDP campaign manager for Windsor—Walkerville in 1985 and 1987, working on behalf of unsuccessful candidates Gary Parent and Donna Champagne.

While otherwise a supporter, Comartin was highly critical of Leader of the NDP Ed Broadbent&#x27;s conduct in the 1988 Canadian federal election. Comartin believed that Broadbent had unwisely focused on nationwide campaigning rather than targeting winnable ridings. Comartin also believed that Broadbent had failed to capitalise on the NDP&#x27;s traditionally protectionist trade policy amidst widespread opposition to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, which the Liberals had made a major campaign issue. Local NDP MPs Howard McCurdy and Steven Langdon both agreed with Comartin&#x27;s assessment. Broadbent chose to resign as Leader shortly after the election, and both McCurdy and Langdon ran to replace him in the 1989 New Democratic Party leadership election. McCurdy and Langdon&#x27;s rivalry as leadership candidates was exacerbated by the fact that they came from neighbouring ridings and had to compete for support in their home county. Comartin supported McCurdy, who made a surprisingly poor showing of fifth place on the first ballot of the leadership convention. On the second ballot, McCurdy withdrew and endorsed Langdon. Following McCurdy&#x27;s withdrawal Comartin supported Langdon, even after McCurdy changed his endorsement to Audrey McLaughlin, the eventual winner, on the third ballot.

In the lead-up to the 1990 Ontario general election, Donna Champagne surprisingly chose not to run again. Champagne endorsed the relatively unknown Wayne Lessard, who became the ONDP nominee in Windsor—Walkerville in her stead. Comartin campaigned for Lessard, but was out of the country for part of the election season. Before leaving the country, Comartin predicted that the ONDP would do about as well as it had in the previous election, and expected the party to win about 17 seats in the Legislative Assembly. After returning to Canada, Comartin found that support for the party had surged, and the ONDP went on to form government for the first time in Ontarian history. Leader of the ONDP Bob Rae became Premier of Ontario. In Windsor—Walkerville, Lessard defeated Liberal incumbent Mike Ray.

Comartin declined to run for mayor in the 1991 Windsor municipal election.

In 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made his second attempt at constitutional reform, known as the Charlottetown Accord. Approval of the Accord was subject to a nationwide referendum, with Canada&#x27;s three major parties, the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, and the New Democrats all supporting its ratification. Comartin was made campaign manager for the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign in Windsor, and directed all three parties&#x27; riding associations in the area. Despite massive institutional support, Windsor voted against ratifying the Accord by a nearly two-to-one margin.

Comartin did a great deal of lobbying on behalf of Windsor&#x27;s unions to convince the Rae Government to build Ontario&#x27;s first casino in Windsor. Comartin&#x27;s efforts were supported by Dave Cooke, a fellow Windsorite and a senior member of Rae&#x27;s cabinet. The lobbying was a success, resulting in the eventual construction of Caesars Windsor. Comartin was appointed to the Ontario Casino Corporation (OCC) board of directors in 1993.

Rae&#x27;s ONDP government was defeated in a landslide in the 1995 Ontario general election by the Progressive Conservatives, led by Mike Harris. Shortly after being elected, the Harris Government removed Comartin from his position on the board of the OCC before his term had expired, which was widely seen as politically motivated. The removal caused an uproar in Windsor, as it deprived the city of any representation on the board of the OCC despite having (at the time) the only casino in the province.

==Political career==
Having grown up without a father and being especially aware of the strain that put on a family, Comartin had delayed any political aspirations until after his children were grown. Comartin ran for MP in his home riding of Windsor—St. Clair in the 1997 Canadian federal election. Comartin campaigned on job creation and expanding healthcare coverage against Liberal incumbent Shaughnessy Cohen, who was considered vulnerable after a personal finance scandal in which she defaulted on her debt. Other notable candidates included Mayor of Tecumseh Harold Downs and national party treasurer Bruck Easton for the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties respectively. Despite the scandal and frequent appearances on his behalf by Leader of the NDP Alexa McDonough, Comartin was defeated, placing second to Cohen. The 1997 election was also marred by personal tragedy; Comartin&#x27;s mother died in the first week of the campaign, with her second husband having predeceased her seven years earlier, and in the week following the campaign, Comartin&#x27;s youngest son Adam was in a motorcycle accident which left his right arm permanently paralyzed.

After Cohen&#x27;s sudden death in office, Comartin ran in the 1999 by-election to replace her. Comartin&#x27;s main opponent was city councillor Rick Limoges, who defeated Cohen&#x27;s widower, Jerry Cohen, for the Liberal nomination. While the by-election was mainly considered a competition between Comartin and Limoges, Bruck Easton was once again fielded as the candidate of the Progressive Conservatives, while Reform nominated mortgage broker and former magician Scott Cowan. Comartin&#x27;s campaign manager Joe MacDonald was assigned to him by the NDP. MacDonald was a well-known party insider and campaign manager. Comartin ultimately lost by less than one hundred votes to Limoges in what was initially expected to be a Liberal landslide. Besides a general decline in Liberal popularity, it was speculated that the closeness of the race was in part because of high ticket sales in Windsor for an anticipated Detroit Tigers game happening on the same day. The game may have deflated voter turnout to the detriment of Limoges. Comartin later claimed that MacDonald had not believed that he had a chance of winning and had not worked as hard as he could have because of it. MacDonald denied the allegation, and charged that the problems with the campaign were because of interference by Comartin&#x27;s family.

Comartin challenged Limoges again the next year with environmental protection as his main issue. The rematch was very similar to the previous year, with it being mainly considered a competition between Comartin and Limoges, and with Bruck Easton appearing yet again as the Progressive Conservative candidate. Since the by-election, the Reform Party had rebranded as the Canadian Alliance in anticipation of a merger with the Progressive Conservatives. The Alliance nominated autoworker Phil Pettinato as their candidate. In their second bout, Comartin narrowly defeated Limoges. Besides the strong support expected from progressives and union members, Comartin also benefitted from conservatives who strategically voted for him in the hopes of harming the ruling Liberals. Comartin&#x27;s victory was attributed to the conservative strategic vote.

Through his victory, Comartin became the first New Democrat to be elected in Ontario in ten years, and the first New Democrat to represent an Ontario riding in seven; Michael Breaugh had won a by-election in Oshawa in 1990, but had been defeated with the NDP&#x27;s nine other Ontario MPs in the 1993 Canadian federal election. Shortly after being elected, Comartin was appointed as his party&#x27;s critic for the environment.

Following the September 11 attacks, Comartin caused controversy by opposing direct military intervention to assist the United States in its invasion of Afghanistan. He did, however, support greatly expanding the Canadian military budget in order to properly meet pre-existing commitments.

In 2002, Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray of Windsor West was removed in a cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Instead of serving out the rest of his term, Gray decided to resign from parliament to become Canadian Chair of the International Joint Commission. In the ensuing by-election, Comartin supported the campaign of city councillor Brian Masse, who went on to win Gray&#x27;s old seat. Masse became the NDP caucus&#x27; second Ontario MP after Comartin, and the NDP would go on to control both of Windsor&#x27;s federal ridings for the next seventeen years. Comartin and Masse had a close working relationship, and were nicknamed &quot;The Twindsors.&quot;

===Leadership bid===

Almost immediately after being elected was talked about in Windsor as a potential successor to Alexa McDonough as Leader of the NDP. Comartin did not hide his interest in the position, and a Toronto political scientist suggested that he would have a strong starting position as the NDP&#x27;s only MP from Ontario.

In preparation for declaring his candidacy, Comartin recruited prominent union activist Peter Leibovitch as his campaign manager.

Comartin intended to announce his candidacy on July 29, 2002. Comartin had previously made an agreement with leadership competitor Lorne Nystrom to have the latter&#x27;s announcement made on July 31, 2002, but a misprint in The Canadian Press reported that Nystrom would be announcing his candidacy on the 29th as well. Initially believing it to be an intentional slight, Comartin cancelled his announcement to avoid having it on the same day as Nystrom. Comartin instead announced his candidacy on August 13, becoming the last candidate to enter the race.

Comartin was not considered a serious candidate by the campaigns of the perceived frontrunners, Toronto city councillor Jack Layton, NDP House Leader Bill Blaikie, and veteran MP Lorne Nystrom: The Layton campaign dismissed the idea that Comartin could draw Ontarian support away from Layton, Nystrom&#x27;s campaign manager (and Comartin&#x27;s campaign manager in the 1999 by-election) Joe MacDonald questioned why Comartin was running, and Blaikie&#x27;s campaign manager Iain Angus criticised his inexperience as an MP. Howard McCurdy, Comartin&#x27;s longtime associate, wrote off Comartin&#x27;s leadership bid as an attempt to raise his profile, and endorsed Blaikie later in the campaign. Additionally, despite his close association with them, the CAW withheld support for Comartin in anticipation of a potential entry into the race by President of the CAW Buzz Hargrove. Hargrove ultimately decided not to run but only endorsed Comartin late into the campaign, which limited the amount of formal assistance he received from the CAW.

To win the leadership, Comartin intended to build a coalition of labour unions, farmers, anti-war activists, Arab Canadians, and Muslim Canadians, with most of his energy focused on the latter two groups. Comartin was frequently involved with Windsor&#x27;s large Arab community, and had been a vocal critic of the post-9/11 discriminatory backlash against Arabs and Muslims.

Comartin&#x27;s bold positions on foreign policy caused frequent controversy.

During the campaign, Comartin was approached by the Palestine House non-profit organisation, which suggested that he go on a trip to Iraq to observe the 2002 Iraqi presidential referendum. Comartin agreed to the trip, which was paid for by a businessman associated with Palestine House. Comartin observed the vote, and met with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. While in Iraq, Comartin called for an end to embargoes on Iraq on humanitarian grounds, and declared his opposition to a potential American invasion of Iraq. Comartin was criticised for a photo taken of him in Iraq which had a large picture of Saddam Hussein in the background. He dismissed the criticism, stating, &quot;The purpose of the picture is simply to establish that I went to Iraq... If anybody knows anything about Iraq, and the police state that it is, it&#x27;s almost impossible to be in any public building without a picture of Saddam Hussein.&quot; Comartin was very critical of Hussein, describing him as an authoritarian and dictator, and comparing him to Satan.

Once back in Canada, Comartin called for the Canadian government&#x27;s ban on Hezbollah to be lifted, on the grounds that there was not sufficient evidence to categorise it as a terrorist group. Comartin was criticised by those who held Hezbollah responsible for the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.

Of all the candidates running in the leadership race, Comartin was considered the most sympathetic toward Palestinians, including supporting the Palestinian right of return. Critics noted that Comartin&#x27;s website, which mainly focused on foreign affairs, was highly critical of Israel but made no mention of Palestinian terrorism, unlike the websites of all the other candidates. This prompted allegations that Comartin was using anti-Zionist policy positions as a cover for antisemitism. In response, Comartin said that his opposition to Palestinian terrorism &quot;goes without saying.&quot; Ish Theilheimer, a Jewish news publisher and former aide to Leader of the ONDP Howard Hampton, endorsed Comartin, and rejected the idea that he was antisemitic or supported antisemitic violence in any way.

Despite the frequent controversy, analysis suggested that Comartin gained more support from his foreign policy positions than he lost. Notably, party membership sign-ups made by the Montreal Muslim community with the intention of voting for Comartin in the leadership race more than doubled the NDP&#x27;s small Quebec membership. In total, Comartin sold approximately 4,000 new memberships, placing him close behind NDP House Leader Bill Blaikie, who sold 5,500, but far behind Layton, who sold 8,100.

Going into the convention, Comartin predicted that he was in third place behind Layton and Blaikie. He hoped that he had enough support from sign-ups and unions to prevent Layton from winning on the first ballot. Comartin then expected that high turnout in Ontario would allow him to pass Blaikie on the second ballot and eventually defeat Layton.

Comartin&#x27;s theme songs at the convention were Small Town by John Mellencamp and A Little Less Conversation by Elvis Presley. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; sarcastically described the latter choice as appropriate due to the extensive length of the speeches of his surrogates.

At the convention vote Layton won a majority on the first ballot, with Comartin placing fourth behind Blaikie and Nystrom. Comartin&#x27;s poor showing was attributed to a late start and a lack of focus on domestic issues. Comartin said that it was unlikely he would run for the party&#x27;s leadership again in future.

At the end of the campaign, Comartin had a budget surplus of $6,800 out of a total campaign revenue of $70,000.

===Political career following leadership bid===
Following the leadership race, Layton praised Comartin for &quot;helping to shape the future of this party&quot; and appointed him energy critic and multiculturalism critic, as well as maintaining his previous position as environment critic.

Comartin ran for re-election in 2004 in a second rematch against Rick Limoges. The Conservative Party, created from a merger of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives, nominated autoworker Rick Fuschi. The riding, Windsor—St. Clair, had been slightly re-districted and renamed Windsor—Tecumseh. Comartin ran mainly on healthcare expansion and border issues. He prominently criticised an unpopular plan to convert the residential area Michigan Central Railway Tunnel into an international highway, and supported putting stricter measures in place to prevent American police from pursuing suspects into Canada after recent incidents in Windsor and Niagara Falls. Comartin also campaigned on expanding Windsor&#x27;s auto industry through business incentives for pollution-efficient manufacturing, and through protectionist policies to prevent outsourcing to the United States. During the campaign, Comartin had a public disagreement with Layton; Layton had declared that Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s budget cuts to affordable housing made him personally responsible for homeless people who died of exposure. Layton was widely criticised for his statement, including by Comartin, who considered it sensationalist. Polling indicated that Comartin&#x27;s constituents approved of his public disagreement with Layton. Despite the row, Comartin and Layton still made several campaign appearances together, and Comartin defeated Limoges by a wider margin than in 2000.

Following the 2004 election, Comartin was discharged as energy critic and appointed as justice critic. In his role as justice critic, Comartin was described by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; as &quot;one of the opposition&#x27;s best... knowledgeable, quotable, accesible... and a more effective justice and public safety critic than the former justice minister.&quot;

Comartin spent most of the summer of 2004 travelling to the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand as part of the Committee of Parliament on National Security, which engaged in a series of international hearings on national security and intelligence sharing in the wake of 9/11. Comartin submitted that the 9/11 attacks could have been prevented if American intelligence agencies had engaged in intelligence sharing with each other instead of hoarding information out of sense of interdepartmental rivalry. Comartin recommended that Canada consolidate its intelligence and security agencies into one department. He also supported the expiry of temporary changes to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; made after 9/11 which allowed the police to make arrests without a warrant and which could force witnesses to testify in closed courts.

===Gay marriage controversy===
Comartin had a voting record in favour of gay marriage. In 2003 he voted to reject legally defining marriage as being between a man and a woman. When the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that parliament had the right to legalise gay marriage, Comartin called for a vote to legalise it. Believing it to be a civil rights issue and therefore not ethically up for debate, Comartin rejected the idea of a free vote, and wanted the Liberal Party, Bloc Québécois, and NDP to uphold their previous promises to legalise gay marriage by enforcing a vote along party lines.

In January 2005, the Martin Government indicated that it would introduce a vote on gay marriage. In response, Bishop Ronald Fabbro of London, Ontario called on the members of his diocese to lobby against gay marriage. Fabbro also asked the pastors of his diocese to make pronouncements against gay marriage at their sermons. Comartin, a self-described devout Catholic, attended Our Lady of the Rosary Church, which was a part of Fabbro&#x27;s diocese. Comartin also participated in extensive volunteer work with the church, including teaching a marriage preparation course with his wife.

As it passed through parliament in 2005, Comartin consistently voted in favour of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act,&quot; which legalised gay marriage in Canada.

Following the passage of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, Fabbro published an open letter announcing that Comartin would be suspended from all liturgical privileges and public church activities. He instructed Gerry Compeau, the pastor of Our Lady of the Rosary, to read the letter aloud to the congregation and hand out copies. Jim Roche, the episcopal vicar of Windsor, clarified that Comartin remained a Catholic in good standing and would still be able to receive communion, but otherwise supported Fabbro&#x27;s position. The public censure was also endorsed by Cardinal Marc Ouellet.

The reading of the bishop&#x27;s letter prompted a walkout of 30 of the 150 attendants of the sermon. In a special section of the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; dedicated to letters of opinion on the controversy, a majority of the letters printed by the &quot;Star&quot; supported Comartin. Other Catholic MPs criticised the Catholic Church for inconsistency; of all the Catholics in parliament, only Comartin and fellow NDP MP Charlie Angus were excluded from church activities for supporting gay marriage.

Comartin attended the sermon following his censure at Our Lady of the Rosary, where he was well received, after which he attended a picnic hosted by the CAW Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus. Comartin stood by his support for the &quot;Civil Marriage Act,&quot; calling it &quot;the fair and just thing to do.&quot;

In 2007, Our Lady of the Rosary was shut down along with eleven other Windsor Catholic churches. Spokesman Ron Pickersgill, representing Bishop Fabbro and the London diocese, announced that the decision had been made because of declining attendance and high upkeep costs. The building was later purchased and converted into the Water&#x27;s Edge Event Centre .

===Parliamentary leadership roles===
In early 2005, the Liberal Martin Government altered its annual budget after negotiations with the NDP in order to prevent the fall of its minority government. Late in 2005, after the conclusion of the investigation into the Liberal Sponsorgate scandal, the Liberals were unwilling to meet the NDP&#x27;s terms for their continued support. As a result, the NDP voted in favour of a motion of no-confidence put forward by the Conservative Party, which forced a rare winter election scheduled to take place in January 2006. Like the rest of the NDP caucus, Comartin voted in favour of both the altered Liberal budget and the no-confidence vote.

Early in the campaign, President of the CAW Buzz Hargrove eschewed his usual endorsement of the NDP. Instead, he encouraged CAW members to only support the NDP in ridings they were likely to win, and to otherwise support Liberal candidates to prevent Conservative candidates from winning. Comartin described Hargrove&#x27;s position as &quot;disappointing,&quot; but noted that the local CAW backlash against Hargrove&#x27;s decision was so great that it actually helped his campaign. Comartin was endorsed by CAW Local 444 President Ken Lewenza Sr., who went on to become President of the CAW after Hargrove&#x27;s retirement. After the campaign, Hargrove was expelled from the NDP, which Comartin opposed.

Comartin&#x27;s main competition in the election was Bruck Easton, who was running as the Liberal candidate in a final attempt at elected office. After serving as the party&#x27;s national treasurer, Easton became the final president of the Progressive Conservative Party before it merged with the Canadian Alliance. Easton had been guarded about the merger, and switched to the Liberal Party after prominent Reform/Alliance member Stephen Harper was chosen as the new Conservative Party&#x27;s first leader. Easton was notably endorsed by Howard McCurdy, who Easton had run against in his first attempt at elected office in 1988. Comartin dismissed McCurdy&#x27;s ability to influence the election outcome. The Conservatives renominated Rick Fuschi. As in previous elections, Comartin emphasised expanding healthcare coverage and protectionist trade policies to maintain Windsor&#x27;s auto industry. Despite expectations of a potentially close race, Comartin won a commanding victory, with Easton barely outpolling Fuschi for a distant second place.

Following the 2006 election Comartin began to take on a series of parliamentary leadership roles. In February 2006, Comartin was appointed Deputy House Leader of the NDP, serving under House Leader of the NDP Libby Davies. That same year, Comartin was appointed vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.

Comartin was part of a Canadian delegation to Russia in June 2006 along with Conservative MP Stockwell Day and Liberal MP Irwin Cotler, when Cotler was allegedly poisoned by the Russian government. Cotler had previously acted as the lawyer or public advocate for Russian dissidents Natan Sharansky, Andrei Sakharov, Alexander Nikitin, and Sergei Magnitsky.

In 2007, Comartin was voted &quot;most knowledgeable member of parliament&quot; by other MPs in a Maclean&#x27;s poll. Comartin did not vote in the poll as he had a personal boycott against Maclean&#x27;s for being &quot;grossly unfair and inaccurate&quot; in its consistently low ranking of the University of Windsor as a school. He was also elected &quot;most knowledgeable member of parliament&quot; in 2009 and 2011.

Comartin supported the legalisation of sports betting as a means of generating revenue and as a way to regulate underground sports betting already taking place. Comartin&#x27;s secondary objective was to generate more revenue for the Canadian Football League (CFL) in order to prevent the American National Football League (NFL) from expanding into Canada. Comartin made his first attempt to legalise sports betting in 2008 by introducing a private member&#x27;s bill into parliament. His first attempt did not progress pass its first reading. His second and third attempts made in 2011 and 2013 both passed through the House of Commons but expired in the Senate. A fourth unsuccessful attempt was made by Brian Masse on Comartin&#x27;s behalf in 2013. Sports betting was eventually legalised in 2020, after Comartin&#x27;s retirement from parliament, with a private member&#x27;s bill introduced by Conservative Kevin Waugh.

Comartin was commended for his role on the ethics committee investigation into charges of bribery against former prime minister Brian Mulroney in the airbus affair.

Comartin was widely expected to win in the 2008 Canadian federal election, and ran against a collection of novice candidates. The Conservative candidate was business management consultant Denise Ghanam, while the Liberals ran government relations manager Steve Mastroianni. Comartin was easily elected to a fourth term. While still placing fourth, the Green Party notably had its best-ever result in the riding with candidate Kyle Prestanski, an environmental science graduate student. Following his re-election, Comartin called for greater cooperation between the NDP and the Liberals, foreshadowing his support for an unsuccessful attempt by the two parties to form a coalition government after the election. It was speculated that if the coalition government had successfully formed that Comartin would have been made Minister of Justice. However, during the coalition negotiations Comartin also mounted an unsuccessful challenge against Liberal incumbent Peter Milliken for the role of Speaker of the House, placing fourth on the fifth ballot behind Millikin and Conservatives Andrew Scheer and Mervin Tweed.

Having won by a wider margin in every election, Comartin was concerned that low turnout by overconfident supporters would threaten his chances of re-election in the 2011 Canadian federal election. Comartin campaigned on job creation, expanding pensions, lowering the tax rate on small businesses, and providing business incentives for the renewable energy sector. The Conservatives nominated Denise Ghanam for a second time, while future MP Irek Kusmierczyk was the Liberal candidate. Comartin&#x27;s concerns turned out to be misplaced, as he won with his best ever result, gaining a near-majority of the vote. The 2011 election was also the NDP&#x27;s best ever result, becoming the Official Opposition for the first time.

With the NDP becoming the Official Opposition, Comartin was promoted to Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition, as well as vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. His former superior, Libby Davies, was replaced by Tom Mulcair as House Leader of the Official Opposition, although Davies remained Co-Deputy Leader of the NDP alongside Mulcair. Shortly after, Jack Layton took a leave of absence as Leader of the NDP and Leader of the Opposition for health reasons, appointing Nycole Turmel as interim leader. Layton subsequently died of complications related to cancer. Under Turmel&#x27;s interim leadership, Comartin retained his role of justice critic. After Mulcair stepped down as House Leader to run for leadership of the party, Comartin was made the new House Leader. Comartin declined to make a second attempt at leadership of the party, citing his advanced age (he turned 64 in 2011). He also declined to formally endorse a candidate in the leadership race in order to maintain his impartiality as House Leader, but spoke highly of Niki Ashton and hosted her campaign event in Windsor. At the leadership convention Ashton was eliminated on the first ballot after placing last, with Mulcair winning on the fourth ballot.

Following Mulcair&#x27;s election as leader in 2012, Comartin was replaced as House Leader of the Opposition by Nathan Cullen and replaced as justice critic by Francoise Boivin. He was, however, appointed critic for democratic reform. The apparent demotion was attributed to Cullen&#x27;s greater prominence in the party after placing third in the leadership race, and a desire to give Boivin, a former Liberal MP turned New Democrat MP, a prominent position to improve her chances of re-election. That same year, Comartin was acclaimed as Deputy Speaker of the House, serving under Speaker of the House Andrew Scheer. Comartin replaced fellow New Democrat Denise Savoie, who had resigned from parliament for health reasons. Upon being acclaimed, Comartin declared that his priorities would be to maintain the civility and decorum of the House. Comartin&#x27;s first act as Deputy Speaker was to censure Brian Masse for using his debate time to congratulate him on his acclamation to Deputy Speaker when it was not the topic of debate.

Assuming the role of Deputy Speaker required Comartin to step down from his remaining critic roles and committee positions. Two months into his tenure, Comartin admitted that he preferred being able to participate in debate rather than act as a neutral arbiter.

After fourteen years in office, including two years as Deputy Speaker, Comartin announced that he would not run for re-election in the 2015 Canadian federal election. In a four-way race, Cheryl Hardcastle, the former deputy mayor of Tecumseh, was selected as the NDP nominee to succeed Comartin in Windsor—Tecumseh. Hardcastle&#x27;s main competitor for the nomination was Comartin staffer and co-founder of the Canadian Afghanistan War Veterans Association Bruce Moncur. Hardcastle held the riding for the NDP in 2015, but nationally the party dropped back down to third place despite anticipation from supporters that the party could form government for the first time. Hardcastle would later lose in an upset to Liberal Irek Kusmierczyk, who had himself placed a distant third to Comartin in 2011.

==Consul General of Canada==
Following the 2015 election Comartin began a three-year break from public life, although he still made occasional public statements. He began teaching political science at the University of Windsor in 2016.

Comartin described President Donald Trump as erratic, and was concerned that his policies would damage the United States-Canadian trade relationship, the ease of commuting across the border to work, and the ease of border crossing more generally.

Comartin was critical of Tom Mulcair&#x27;s decision to stay on temporarily as Leader of the NDP after being removed in a leadership review instead of resigning and appointing an interim leader ahead of the 2017 New Democratic Party leadership election. No longer bound by the impartiality expected from being House Leader, Comartin formally endorsed Niki Ashton in her second bid for leadership. Ashton placed third out of a field of four, behind runner-up Charlie Angus and winner Jagmeet Singh.

In 2018, Comartin was approached by the Trudeau Government to see if he was interested in replacing Douglas George as the Consul General in Detroit. Comartin was surprised he was offered the position given his age and lack of interest in the position, and assumed that he was approached because of his closeness with the auto industry. While initially hesitant to take the position, Comartin ultimately accepted in order to facilitate an expansion of the auto industry in Windsor following the ratification of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) His term began on October 29, 2018.

The Trudeau Government assigned Comartin three major priorities for his term: oversee the conclusion of the then-ongoing negotiations of CUSMA, settle an ongoing steel and aluminum tariff dispute with the United States, and monitor the ongoing construction of the Gordie Howe International Bridge. Comartin also had a personal interest in encouraging American tourism toward Windsor, particularly for its casino and wine industries.

Comartin described his work as 80% meeting with American politicians and corporate executives, and 20% administrative work, with a majority of the administrative work being dedicated to trade and commerce between Canada and the United States.

Comartin was supportive of Canadian automotive technology companies attending the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

Near the end of Comartin&#x27;s term as Consul General, Freedom Convoy protestors blockaded the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor and Detroit. Comartin testified at the Public Order Emergency Commission, which investigated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s use of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; to disperse the protestors. Comartin reported to the inquiry that there was great concern in American political circles that the different branches of the Canadian government seemed unable to work together to remove the blockade prior to the use of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;, resulting in billions of dollars in lost revenue from stopped international commerce.

Comartin&#x27;s term ended on July 28, 2022. By the end of his term, CUSMA had been ratified. Likewise, the steel and aluminum tariff dispute had concluded, for which Comartin took credit. The Gordie Howe Bridge is expected to open in 2024.

Upon his retirement, Comartin noted that he had had a particularly good working relationship with governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Eric Holcomb of Indiana. He was succeeded as Consul General by trade specialist Colin Bird.

==Political positions==
Comartin identifies as a social democrat and has described himself as moderately to the left of the NDP platform. He supports giving the riding associations and other party-aligned grassroots organisations much more influence in setting party policy.

In the early 2000s the NDP was ideologically split. The right wing of the party supported the Third Way trend set by Tony Blair, which had been emulated by Alexa McDonough. The left wing of the party formed the New Politics Initiative (NPI) faction, which pushed for further left policies, the abolition of the NDP, and the following creation of a new leftist party. Like Jack Layton, Comartin was part of the centre-left of the party, which was sympathetic to the NPI but not affiliated with it.

===Economic policy===
During the 2003 NDP leadership race, Comartin was considered the furthest left candidate on economic policy, not including minor candidate Bev Meslo.

Comartin has dismissed the idea of nationalising banks or oil companies.

Comartin has proposed eliminating Canada&#x27;s goods and services tax from essential services such as home heating. He also supports the creation of a regulatory agency which would set price controls for gasoline and other common fuels.

Comartin was very critical of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and free trade with the United States for most of his career. Near the start of his career as an MP, he accused NAFTA of undermining Canadian sovereignty to American business interests and worsening income inequality. He instead proposed creating trade deals &quot;modelled on the European Union, which protect the environment, human rights and cultural distinctions.&quot; Amidst Canadian-American tariff negotiations in 2006, Comartin suggested that Canada should leave NAFTA if the United States did not remove tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. As late as the 2012 NDP leadership race, Comartin voiced his disapproval of Tom Mulcair&#x27;s intention to shift the party&#x27;s trade policy to be in favour of free trade. However, when asked about NAFTA halfway through his term as Consul General, Comartin said &quot;overall it was positive when we brought it into effect. There was certainly a lot of opposition to it for concerns, some of which turned out to not be valid, others which in fact did surface and continue to be [valid], some of which fortunately were addressed in the USMCA, the new one.&quot; Comartin elaborated that while NAFTA caused significant job loss in manufacturing jobs such as in Windsor&#x27;s auto industry, it had been offset by overall higher job creation and economic growth, and that the trade relationship between Canada, the United States, and Mexico had been more beneficial than the European Union. While still supporting protectionist policies for some key economic sectors, he described a national policy of protectionism as a danger to ongoing economic partnership. 
Comartin opposes selling office buildings owned by the federal government on the grounds that more revenue can be accumulated through rent than through the lump-sum income earned from a sale.

===Election process===
Comartin supports introducing a proportional representation voting system in Canada. He also supports abolishing the Senate.

Comartin is supportive of collaborating with the Parti Québécois and emulating their provincial social democratic policies on the federal level. Comartin believes that Quebec has a right to separate with a simple majority of the vote, contrary to the &quot;Clarity Act,&quot; but personally opposes separation.

During a crucial 2005 budget vote, Comartin accused Prime Minister Paul Martin of bribing Conservative MPs to cross the floor to the Liberal Party in exchange for desirable postings. Comartin supports a procedural reform to allow MPs to disaffiliate from their party and sit as an independent in parliament, but which would require them to resign and run in a by-election if they switched parties. As it stands, MPs may switch party affiliation and remain in office until the next federal election.

Comartin supports reforming the selection process for superior court judges. Rather than have the partisan Minister of Justice make selections from screening committees under their ministry&#x27;s control, Comartin instead supports the entire federal cabinet selecting candidates put forward by a non-partisan screening committee.

Comartin has proposed a series of changes to parliamentary procedure including prohibitions and fines on any sexist, racist, or homophobic remarks, compelling apologies for any such remarks, suspending MPs who persistently and willfully disrupt proceedings, and giving the Speaker of the House the power to refuse to call on MPs unable to maintain order. Likewise, Comartin supports introducing a more formal code of conduct for the cabinet.

Comartin supports making the expenses of MPs more publicly available, although he prefers having an annual private audit rather than have it be the responsibility of the Auditor General. In the &quot;Windsor Star&#x27;s&quot; publication of expenses in the 2007-2008 fiscal year, Comartin was found to have the lowest expenses compared to the other local MPs, Brian Masse of Windsor West and Jeff Watson of Essex. Comartin&#x27;s expenses grew after he became Deputy Speaker of the House. In a 2011 report, Comartin was also found to have the best attendance of the three.

Comartin is opposed to the use of attack ads.

===Environmental policy===
Comartin supports putting tighter restrictions on pollution to improve water and air quality. He blames the United States for half of the air pollution in Windsor due to its continued construction of coal plants in the region. Likewise, Comartin has voiced concerns over the reportedly poor maintenance and upkeep of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant in Michigan.

Comartin supports the Kyoto Protocol and a ban on single-hull oil tankers. Comartin was highly critical of the Martin Government&#x27;s allocation of funds for Canada&#x27;s Kyoto Protocol commitments. While the Martin Government budgeted one billion dollars as promised, Comartin noted it was put into a trust; the Auditor General had previously criticised the Martin Government&#x27;s trusts for being unaccountable and lacking in transparency, and for not spending the majority of the money allotted to them. Comartin also pointed out that a sizable portion of the money was reserved for research rather than the construction of renewable energy projects: &quot;We don&#x27;t need more research — we know how the wind works. A loan-grant program would have been much better, so people could have had access to capital to actually build some projects.&quot;

Comartin supports tougher restrictions on animal abuse and having animals legally recognised as persons instead of property.

===Foreign policy===
Comartin supported Canadian peacekeepers being deployed to Rwanda during the Rwandan Genocide. He regretted that the Canadian response had not been significantly larger, and felt that the mission that was sent was inadequate.

Comartin is supportive of Canada&#x27;s territorial claims in the arctic, and is suspicious of potential American encroachment on Canada&#x27;s claims.

Comartin supports allowing citizens to cross the United States-Canada border using their driver&#x27;s license as identification, rather than passports being the only acceptable form of identification, to encourage cross-border tourism and commerce.

Comartin considers the Holodomor to be a genocide.

===Public safety===
Comartin has been particularly concerned over a lack of safety measures for migrant farm workers. Migrant workers in Leamington, Ontario testified to Comartin in early 2001 that they were forced to spray pesticides without protection and work without overtime pay in poor living conditions under the threat of being deported back to Mexico. Comartin attributed their poor working conditions to insufficient health and safety regulations, poor enforcement of existing regulations, and a lack of union representation. Comartin renewed his push for greater regulations following the deaths of three migrant workers in Kitchener in late 2001 from hydrogen sulfide poisoning. Comartin supported the opening of the Migrant Agricultural Workers Support Center in Leamington, which advocates for migrant workers, especially for their right to collective bargaining and for their inclusion in the &quot;Occupational Health and Safety Act.&quot;

Comartin is opposed to the use of cannabis. Prior to its legalisation, he supported making cannabis possession a non-criminal offence. Despite being opposed to its use, he expected that gradual decriminalisation would lead to legalisation.

Comartin supports the Canadian Firearms Registry, believing it to be a vital tool for police. Comartin attributed a decline in gun deaths to the introduction of the registry, stating &quot;A lot of people who probably shouldn&#x27;t have had guns or didn&#x27;t know how to use them decided to get rid of their guns because they had to register them.&quot; He has voted against attempts to abolish it.

Comartin believes that Cybertip , a government tipline to report child pornography, is inadequately funded. Comartin supported a bill to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16.

In his role as justice critic, Comartin announced the NDP would not support a Liberal bill making it easier for the federal government to seize the assets of convicted gang members and drug traffickers. Comartin doubted the constitutionality of the bill, as it created a reverse onus which shifted the burden of proof from the government to the suspect. Comartin opposed similar bills introduced by the Conservatives. Comartin opposes mandatory minimum sentences except for large-scale white-collar crimes; Comartin believes that crime is not deterred by harsher sentences, but is deterred by a fear of being caught. To that end, he supports expanding the size of police forces to deter street crime, and stronger regulations and more frequent audits to deter white-collar crime. Additionally, Comartin supports expanding the availability of youth programs, women&#x27;s shelters, mental health services, and housing, which he believes will alleviate the root causes of crime. While supporting police expansion, Comartin believes there is insufficient civilian oversight of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).

Comartin is opposed to the death penalty.

Comartin agrees with the Supreme Court verdict made in &quot;Canada v. Bedford&quot;, which legalised prostitution in Canada.

===Social services===
Comartin supports expanding Canadian healthcare coverage to include prescription drugs and long-term care facilities.

Comartin supports government-subsidised daycare, and spoke positively of a similar program in Quebec. He also supports expanding the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, and Employment Insurance.

Comartin opposes the privatisation of utilities.

Comartin supports expanding the funding for immigration settlement services, and supported a bill to allow immigrants living in Canada to sponsor the immigration of non-dependent close relatives. Likewise, Comartin supported a bill to regulate the conduct of immigration consultants.

Comartin supports Canada&#x27;s current system of legal abortion.

Comartin is ambivalent about the idea of legalising euthanasia, and prefers improving palliative care as an alternative. He is concerned that &quot;mercy killings&quot; might become a regular component of an underfunded healthcare system.

==Personal life==
Comartin married his wife, Maureen Comartin (née Granger), on July 5, 1969. Mrs. Comartin was a schoolteacher, and active in the community in education services. She was the program director and supervisor of the Child&#x27;s Place Family Centre, president of the Sandwich Teen Action Group, and education committee chairwoman of the Windsor chapter of the Canadian Federation of University Women. Together they had three children: Eric, Heidi, and Adam. Eric occasionally acted as a spokesman for Comartin&#x27;s campaigns. Comartin has seven grandchildren.

Comartin is fond of tenor singing and the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Comartin&#x27;s favourite authors are Margaret Atwood, Alistair MacLeod, and Guy Vanderhaeghe. He has also studied Roman and Mongolian military history. He occasionally drinks beer.

Comartin&#x27;s serious nature has been frequently commented on. Shortly before her retirement, Leader of the NDP Alexa McDonough recommended that Comartin should smile more, stating &quot;He&#x27;s got this sort of deadly earnestness about him.&quot; Comartin was described in a profile as someone who is &quot;cool in the spotlight, rarely misspeaks and eschews the backslapping charm expected of many politicians...too decent a guy, to a fault [and] non-plussed with the pomp and politicking of Ottawa.&quot; &quot;Windsor Star&quot; journalist Gord Henderson described him as an &quot;intense, ramrod stiff New Democrat, a guy who only cracks a smile at gunpoint and [only] provided it&#x27;s loaded...&quot;

Comartin dislikes Twitter. When first asked if he would be creating a Twitter profile, Comartin replied that &quot;he couldn&#x27;t fathom devoting lots of his time telling people trivial things about his life in 140 characters or less.&quot; During the 2011 election he created a Twitter account which was managed by his staff and later deleted.

<text>The Gulf of Guacanayabo () is a bay along the southern coast of Cuba, bordered by Granma and Las Tunas provinces.

==Overview==
The largest port on the bay is Manzanillo, and the gulf is bordered to the north-west by the Jardines de la Reina archipelago. Cuba&#x27;s longest river, the Cauto River, empties in the Gulf of Guacanayabo.

It is also where, in 2005, Hurricane Dennis had its peak effect.

The Gulf of Guacanayabo is home to the Gran Banco de Buena Espernza reef. The reef spans 25 by 40 kilometers of the central bay and is home to many species adapt at living in the gulf&#x27;s cloudy, muddy waters. Along with this, the Gulf of Guacanayabo contains the Rio Cauto Delta, which has been a recognized Ramsar site since 2002.

== History ==
The precursor to the school of engineering dates back to 1851, when Duke was known as Normal College and located in Randolph County, North Carolina. At that time, engineering was included in a classical course for seniors. A course in engineering was introduced in 1887, eventually becoming a regular course offering in 1903. 
At that time, engineering courses were limited to such fields as architecture and surveying until 1924, when Trinity College was renamed Duke University. Engineering was taught in the new separate departments of civil and electrical engineering. In 1931, a mechanical engineering department was created. Duke&#x27;s Board of Trustees created the College of Engineering in 1939, with William H. Hall its first dean.

The College of Engineering graduated its first female graduates in 1946. The next year, the three departments moved from East Campus to West Campus. It became the Duke School of Engineering in 1966. Two years later the school&#x27;s first black students graduated. The Division of Biomedical Engineering was created in 1967—the first accredited biomedical engineering department at a U.S. university—in September 1972.

In 1997, the Master of Engineering Management was established.

The school was renamed the Edmund T. Pratt Jr. School of Engineering in 1999, in honor of the 1947 graduate and former CEO of Pfizer.

==Facilities==

Duke Engineering occupies more than 300,000 net square feet of educational, administrative and research space on and near the Duke campus in Durham, North Carolina.

The Duke Engineering campus is adjacent to Duke University Medical Center and 10 miles from Research Triangle Park.

Pratt&#x27;s faculty, labs, and courses can be found in Hudson Hall, the Nello L. Teer Engineering Building, the Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering, Medicine and Applied Sciences (also known as FCIEMAS), Gross Hall, the North Building, the Levine Science Research Center (also known as the LSRC) and in The Chesterfield, a former cigarette factory near downtown Durham that has been redeveloped into academic and industry research space.

===Wilkinson Building===
This 150,000-square-foot building opened for classes in early 2021 with new spaces for education and research related to interdisciplinary themes of improving human health, advancing computing and intelligent systems, and sustainability.

The Wilkinson Building, located at Research Drive and Telcom Drive next to Bostock Library, also houses Duke Engineering&#x27;s entrepreneurship initiatives.

The building&#x27;s name recognizes lifetime philanthropic and service contributions of Duke Engineering alumnus Jerry C. Wilkinson and family.

===Fitzpatrick Center===
The Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering, Medicine and Applied Sciences (FCIEMAS) opened in August 2004. Research facilities focus on the fields of photonics, bioengineering, communications, and materials science and materials engineering. The aim of the building was to emphasize interdisciplinary activities and encourage cross-departmental interactions. The building houses numerous wet bench laboratories (highlighted by a world-class nanotechnology research wing), offices, teaching spaces, and a café. FCIEMAS is also home to the Master of Engineering Management Program offices. The construction of FCIEMAS took more than three years and cost more than $97 million.

===Levine Science Research Center===
The Levine Science Research Center (LSRC) is a facility. When it was opened in 1994, the LSRC was the largest single-site interdisciplinary research facility in the U.S. Its classrooms are shared by several departments, but the majority of its offices and laboratories are utilized by the Nicholas School of the Environment, the Pratt School of Engineering, the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Developmental and the departments of Computer Science, Pharmacology and Cancer Biology and Cell and Molecular Biology. The building was named for Leon Levine, the CEO of Family Dollar Stores.

===Hudson Hall===
Hudson Hall is the oldest engineering building at Duke, constructed in 1948. It was renamed to honor Fitzgerald S. &quot;Jerry&quot; Hudson (E&#x27;46) in 1992.

===Nello L. Teer Building===
The Nello L. Teer Library Building opened in 1984. Located adjacent to Hudson Hall, it is now called the Nello L. Teer Building, and houses the Dean&#x27;s offices, a computing lab, a circuits lab, an auditorium and a student lounge. The building&#x27;s name honors Teer, its donor and a Durham, North Carolina–based builder and philanthropist.

<doc id="540638" wikidata="Q5977438" url="?curid=540638" title="Apple cider">
<text>Apple cider (also called sweet cider, soft cider, or simply cider) is the name used in the United States and Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples. Though typically referred to simply as &quot;cider&quot; in North America, it is not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage known as cider in other places, which is called &quot;hard cider&quot; in the US. Outside of the United States and Canada, it is commonly referred to as cloudy apple juice to distinguish it from clearer, filtered apple juice and hard cider.
Fresh liquid cider is extracted from the whole apple itself, including the apple core, trimmings from apples, and oddly sized or shaped “imperfect” apples, or apple culls. Fresh cider is opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and generally tangier than commercially cooked and filtered apple juice, but this depends somewhat on the variety of apples used. Cider is sometimes pasteurized or exposed to UV light to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life, but traditional raw untreated cider is still common. Some companies have begun adding preservatives and boiling cider, so that it can be shelf stable and stored without refrigeration. In either form, apple cider is seasonally produced in autumn. It is traditionally served on Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Eve, sometimes heated and mulled.

==Nomenclature==

Although the term &quot;cider&quot; is used for the fermented alcoholic drink in much of the world, it often refers to fresh &quot;apple cider&quot; in North America; &quot;hard cider&quot; is used there instead when referring to the alcoholic drink. In much of the U.S. and Canada, the fresh variety is often referred to as &quot;apple cider&quot; with &quot;cider&quot; alone referring to the alcoholic variety.

While some states specify a difference between apple juice and cider, the distinction is not well established across the U.S. Massachusetts makes an attempt to at least differentiate fresh raw cider and processed, cooked apple juice; according to its Department of Agricultural Resources,

apple juice and apple cider are both fruit beverages made from apples, but there is a difference between the two. Fresh cider is raw apple juice that has not undergone a filtration process to remove coarse particles of pulp or sediment. Apple juice is juice that has been cooked and filtered to remove solids, and pasteurized so that it will stay fresh longer. Vacuum sealing and additional filtering extend the shelf life of apple juice.

This still leaves unfiltered apple juice that is no longer raw in a gray area, presumably cider but not labeled as such. The addition of sweeteners or reconstitution from concentrate are left even grayer.

Canada recognizes unfiltered, unsweetened apple juice as cider, fresh or not.

==Natural cider==
Historically all cider was left in its natural state, raw and unprocessed. In time, airborne yeasts present on apple skins or cider making machinery would start fermentation in the finished cider. Left on its own, alcohol would develop and forestall growth of harmful bacteria. When modern refrigeration emerged, cider and other fruit juices could be kept cold or frozen for long periods of time, slowing down fermentation. Any interruption of the refrigeration, however, could allow bacterial contamination to grow. Outbreaks of illness resulted in some state government regulations requiring any commercially produced cider to be treated either with heat or UV radiation.

As a result, natural raw cider is a specialty seasonal beverage, produced on-site at orchards and small rural mills in apple growing areas and sold there, at farmers markets, and some juice bars. Such traditional cider is typically made from a mixture of several different apples to give a balanced taste. Frequently blends of heirloom varieties such as Jonathan and Winesap, once among the most sought-after cider apples for tangy flavor, are used. Many US states now require that unpasteurized cider have a warning label on the bottle.

Even with refrigeration, raw cider will begin to become slightly carbonated within a few weeks, and eventually become hard cider as the fermentation process continues. Some producers use this fermentation to make hard cider; others carry it further on to acetification and create artisanal apple cider vinegar.

==Treated cider==
Many commercially produced ciders are pasteurized or have artificial preservatives added which extends their shelf life; the most common method used is pasteurization, but UV irradiation is also employed.

Pasteurization, which partially cooks the juice, results in some change of the sweetness, body and flavor of the cider; UV radiation has less noticeable effects. Cooking cider and adding chemical preservatives has allowed many ciders to be transported and sold without refrigeration.

Impetus for Federal level regulation began with outbreaks of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 from unpasteurized apple cider and other illnesses caused by contaminated fruit juices in the late 1990s. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made proposals in 1998; Canada began to explore regulation in 2000.

The U.S. regulations were finalized in 2001, with the FDA issuing a rule requiring that juice producers and most large cider producers follow Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) controls, using either heat pasteurization, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), or other proven methods to achieve a 5-log reduction in pathogens.

Canada, however, relies on a voluntary Code of Practice for manufacturers, voluntary labelling of juice/cider as &quot;Unpasteurized&quot;, and an education campaign to inform consumers about the possible health risks associated with the consumption of unpasteurized juice products.
==Commercial production==
Modern cider making has come a long way from early forms of production that involved a man- or horse-powered crusher. These consisted of a stone or wood trough with a heavy circulating wheel to crush the fruit, and a large manual screw press to express the juice from the pulp. Straw was commonly used to contain the pulp during pressing, later replaced by coarse cloth. The Palmer Bros. Company, of Cos Cob, CT, made the most popular &quot;modern&quot; rack and cloth press from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, when production shifted to OESCO in Massachusetts. As technology advanced, rotary drum &quot;scratters&quot; came into use. Today, nearly all small pressing operations use electric-hydraulic equipment with press cloths and plastic racks in what is commonly called a &quot;rack and cloth press&quot;, and electric hammermill &quot;breakers&quot;.

Depending on the varieties of apples and using the optimal extraction methods, it takes about one third of a bushel (10 liters) to make a gallon (3.78 liters) of cider. Apples are washed, cut, and ground into a mash that has the consistency of coarse applesauce. Layers of this mash are then either wrapped in cloth and placed upon wooden or plastic racks where a hydraulic press then squeezes the layers together, or the mash is distributed onto a continuous belt filter press, which squeezes the pulp between two permeable belts fed between a succession of rollers that press the juice out of the pulp in a continuous, highly efficient operation. The resulting juice is then stored in refrigerated tanks, pasteurized to kill bacteria and extend shelf life, and bottled and sold as apple cider. The juice may also be fermented to produce hard cider, which then may be further treated by exposure to acetobacter to produce apple cider vinegar, or distilled to produce apple brandy. The waste left after pressing, known as pomace, is sold for cattle feed.

==Variations==
Hot mulled cider, similar to &quot;wassail&quot;, is a popular autumn and winter beverage. Cider is heated to a temperature just below boiling, with cinnamon, orange peel, nutmeg, cloves, or other spices added.

Rosé apple cider can be obtained using red-fleshed applecrabs.

&quot;Cider doughnuts&quot; traditionally used the yeast in raw cider as a leavener. Today they are sometimes sold at cider mills and roadside stands, though there is no assurance natural cider is used. Visiting apple orchards in the fall for cider, doughnuts, and self-picked apples is a large segment in agritourism.

==Cultural significance==
Apple cider is the official beverage of the U.S. state of New Hampshire.

<doc id="540639" wikidata="Q5487340" url="?curid=540639" title="Frank Howard (Canadian politician)">
<text>Frank Howard (April 26, 1925 – March 15, 2011) was a Canadian trade unionist and politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (MLA) form 1953 to 1956 as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and again from 1979 to 1986 as a member of the New Democratic Party. Between these two terms in provincial politics, he served as a member of Parliament (MP) from 1957 to 1974 representing the federal riding of Skeena.

==Early life and career==
Howard was born in Kimberley, British Columbia. After a career as a logger and labour union organizer, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a BC CCF MLA in 1953 (he had been an unsuccessful candidate in the 1952 provincial election). He was defeated in 1956 but won a seat in the House of Commons representing Skeena in the 1957 election.

Howard first sat as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and then for its successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP). In Parliament, Howard and his caucus colleague Arnold Peters were responsible for reforming Canada&#x27;s divorce laws, and for achieving significant reforms to Canada&#x27;s prison system. He was also instrumental in attaining full voting rights for Canadian First Nations.

Howard stood as a candidate in the 1971 NDP leadership convention, finishing fifth. He was a Member of Parliament for seventeen years until he lost his seat in the 1974 general election.

In 1979, Howard returned to politics, running again for the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He won that election and served as Skeena&#x27;s Member of the Legislative Assembly until his defeat in the 1986 provincial election.

Howard published an autobiography, &quot;From Prison to Parliament&quot;, in 2003, the title referring to his overcoming a troubled upbringing. Howard&#x27;s mother worked as a prostitute on the outskirts of Kootenay River Valley, a mining town, while his father was believed to have been her pimp. Involved with petty thievery as a child, a judge determined that he was neglected and sent him to an orphanage at the age of 12 from which he was sent to a succession of foster homes. During World War II, he found work on a Vancouver shipyard then, in 1943, engaged in a month-long crime spree with an accomplice in the summer of 1943, robbing two jewellery stores and a hotel while armed with a revolver. Howard was convicted of three counts of armed robbery and sentenced to two years on each charge, ultimately serving 20 months in the federal penitentiary before being released on May 1, 1945. After leaving prison he changed his name from Frank Thomas Woodd and found work as a logger, ultimately becoming an organizer for the International Woodworkers of America and serving as president of Local 1-71 for seven years before entering politics in 1952 and then winning his first election in 1953.

Howard died on March 15, 2011, at the age of 85.

<doc id="540641" wikidata="Q959646" url="?curid=540641" title="Phonautograph">
<text>The phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound. Previously, tracings had been obtained of the sound-producing vibratory motions of tuning forks and other objects by physical contact with them, but not of actual sound waves as they propagated through air or other mediums. Invented by Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, it was patented on March 25, 1857. It transcribed sound waves as undulations or other deviations in a line traced on smoke-blackened paper or glass. Scott believed that future technology would allow the traces to be deciphered as a kind of &quot;natural stenography&quot;. Intended as a laboratory instrument for the study of acoustics, it was used to visually study and measure the amplitude envelopes and waveforms of speech and other sounds or to determine the frequency of a given musical pitch by comparison with a simultaneously recorded reference frequency.

It did not occur to anyone before the 1870s that the recordings, called phonautograms, contained enough information about the sound that they could, in theory, be used to recreate it. Because the phonautogram tracing was an insubstantial two-dimensional line, direct physical playback was impossible in any case. However, several phonautograms recorded before 1861 were successfully converted and played as sound in 2008 by optically scanning them and using a computer to process the scans into digital audio files.

== Construction ==

The phonautograph was patented on March 25, 1857 by Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, an editor and typographer of manuscripts at a scientific publishing house in Paris. One day while editing Professor Longet&#x27;s &quot;Traité de Physiologie&quot;, he happened upon that customer’s engraved illustration of the anatomy of the human ear, and conceived of &quot;the imprudent idea of photographing the word.&quot; In 1853 or 1854 (Scott cited both years) he began working on &quot;le problème de la parole s&#x27;écrivant elle-même&quot; (&quot;the problem of speech writing itself&quot;), aiming to build a device that could replicate the function of the human ear. 

Scott coated a plate of glass with a thin layer of lampblack. He then took an acoustic trumpet, and at its tapered end affixed a thin membrane that served as the analog to the eardrum. At the center of that membrane, he attached a rigid boar&#x27;s bristle approximately a centimeter long, placed so that it just grazed the lampblack. As the glass plate was slid horizontally in a well formed groove at a speed of one meter per second, a person would speak into the trumpet, causing the membrane to vibrate and the stylus to trace figures that were scratched into the lampblack. On March 25, 1857, Scott received the French patent #17,897/31,470 for his device, which he called a phonautograph. The earliest known intelligible recorded sound of a human voice was conducted on April 9, 1860 when Scott recorded someone singing the song &quot;Au Clair de la Lune&quot; (&quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot;) on the device. However, the device was not designed to play back sounds, as Scott intended for people to read back the tracings, which he called phonautograms. This was not the first time someone had used a device to create direct tracings of the vibrations of sound-producing objects, as tuning forks had been used in this way by English physicist Thomas Young in 1807. By late 1857, with support from the Société d&#x27;encouragement pour l&#x27;industrie nationale, Scott’s phonautograph was recording sounds with sufficient precision to be adopted by the scientific community, paving the way for the nascent science of acoustics. 

The device&#x27;s true significance in the history of recorded sound was not fully realized prior to March 2008, when it was discovered and resurrected in a Paris patent office by First Sounds, an informal collaborative of American audio historians, recording engineers, and sound archivists founded to make the earliest sound recordings available to the public. The phonautograms were then digitally converted by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who were able to play back the recorded sounds, something Scott had never conceived of. Prior to this point, the earliest known record of a human voice was thought to be an 1877 phonograph recording by Thomas Edison. The phonautograph would play a role in the development of the gramophone, whose inventor, Emile Berliner, worked with the phonautograph in the course of developing his own device.

== Playback ==
By mid-April 1877, Charles Cros had realized that a phonautogram could be converted back into sound by photoengraving the tracing into a metal surface to create a playable groove, then using a stylus and diaphragm similar to those of the phonautograph to reverse the recording process and recreate the sound. Before he was able to put his ideas into practice, the announcement of Thomas Edison&#x27;s phonograph, which recorded sound waves by indenting them into a sheet of tinfoil from which they could be played back immediately, temporarily relegated Cros&#x27;s less direct method to obscurity.

Ten years later, the early experiments of Emile Berliner, the creator of the disc Gramophone, employed a recording machine that was in essence a disc form of the phonautograph. It traced a clear sound-modulated spiral line through a thin black coating on a glass disc. The photoengraving method first proposed by Cros was then used to produce a metal disc with a playable groove. Arguably, these circa 1887 experiments by Berliner were the first known reproductions of sound from phonautograph recordings.

However, as far as is known, no attempt was ever made to use this method to play any of the surviving early phonautograms made by Scott de Martinville. Possibly this was because the few images of them generally available in books and periodicals were of unpromising short bursts of sound, of fragmentary areas of longer recordings, or simply too crude and indistinct to encourage such an experiment.

Nearly 150 years after they had been recorded, promising specimens of Scott de Martinville&#x27;s phonautograms, stored among his papers in France&#x27;s patent office and at the Académie des Sciences, were located by American audio historians. High-quality images of them were obtained. In 2008, the team played back the recordings as sound for the first time. Modern computer-based image processing methods were used to accomplish the playback. The first results were obtained by using a specialized system developed for optically playing recordings on more conventional media which were too fragile or damaged to be played by traditional means. Later, generally available image-editing and image-to-sound conversion software, requiring only a high-quality scan of the phonautogram and an ordinary personal computer, were found to be sufficient for this application.

For First Sounds&#x27; March 2008 release of &quot;Au Clair de la Lune&quot;, its engineers wrote software to improve the stability of the sound. It did the same with a May 17, 1860 recording of &quot;Gamme de la Voix&quot; which First Sounds presented at the Audie Engineering Society&#x27;s convention in late 2008.

== Recovered sounds ==

One phonautogram, created on April 9, 1860, was revealed to be a 20-second recording of the French folk song &quot;Au clair de la lune&quot;. It was initially played at double the original recording speed and believed to be the voice of a woman or child. However, further recordings were uncovered accompanied with notes Scott de Martinville made that inadvertently identified himself as the speaker. At the correct speed, the voice of a man, almost certainly Scott de Martinville himself, is heard singing the song very slowly. Also recovered were two 1860 recordings of &quot;Vole, petite abeille&quot; (&quot;Fly, Little Bee&quot;), a lively song from a comic opera. Previously, the earliest known recording of vocal music was an 1888 Edison wax cylinder phonograph recording of a Handel choral concert.

A phonautogram containing the opening lines of Torquato Tasso&#x27;s pastoral drama Aminta has also been found. Probably recorded in April or May 1860, this phonautogram is the earliest known recording of intelligible spoken words to be played back, predating Frank Lambert&#x27;s 1878 talking clock recording. Earlier recordings, made in 1857, 1854, and 1853, also contain Scott de Martinville&#x27;s voice but are unintelligible because of their low quality, brevity and irregularity of speed. Only one of these recordings, 1857 cornet scale recording, was restored and made intelligible.

<text>Œthelwald was a King of Deira (651–c. 655). He was the son of King Oswald of Northumbria, who was killed at the Battle of Maserfield in 642.

After Oswine of Deira was killed by Oswiu of Bernicia in 651, Œthelwald became king; it is uncertain whether Oswiu (who was Œthelwald&#x27;s uncle) installed him as king or whether Œthelwald took the kingship in opposition to Oswiu. He subsequently allied himself with Oswiu&#x27;s enemy, Penda of Mercia, and assisted Penda during his invasion of Northumbria in 655. However, when the armies of Oswiu and Penda met on 15 November at the Battle of the Winwaed, Œthelwald withdrew his forces. Penda was defeated and killed, perhaps in part because of this desertion, and afterward Œthelwald seems to have lost Deira to Alchfrith, who was installed there by the victorious Oswiu. 

Œthelwald&#x27;s fate is unknown, as nothing is formally recorded of him after the battle. Local tradition, however, held that he became a hermit in Kirkdale, North Yorkshire.

Although he allied himself with the pagan Penda, Œthelwald was a pious Christian and was remembered for his generosity towards St. Cedd, to whom he granted land for a monastery.

<text>Joe Dumars III ( ; born May 24, 1963) is an American professional basketball executive and former player who is the executive vice president and head of basketball operations of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He could play either shooting guard or point guard on offense and was a highly effective defender. He played his entire 14-year career with the Detroit Pistons. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Dumars and Isiah Thomas combined to form one of the best backcourts in NBA history, winning two championships together. Dumars was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

Initially a shooting guard, Dumars moved to point guard following Thomas’ retirement in 1994, sharing ball-handling duties with Grant Hill. Dumars served as the president of basketball operations for the Pistons from 2000 to 2014, winning a third championship as an executive in 2004.

==Early life==
Dumars was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. Dumars&#x27; mother, Ophelia, was a custodian at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches while his father, Joe Dumars Jr. (Big Joe), was a truck driver.

Dumars grew up in an athletic family and he actually preferred football as a child, as all five of his brothers were defensive standouts at Natchitoches Central High School. His brother David later played professional football in the USFL. Dumars played defensive back on the football team until junior high school when a big hit on the field directed him toward basketball. His father built a hoop in the backyard, where Dumars would practice his jump shot.

==College career==
During his four years at McNeese State University, Dumars averaged 22.5 points per game, including 25.8 points per game as a senior – good for sixth in the nation. He finished his college career as the 11th leading scorer in NCAA history.

==Professional career==
===Detroit Pistons (1985–1999)===
Drafted 18th overall in the first round of the 1985 NBA draft, he played guard for the Detroit Pistons for his entire career, from 1985 to 1999. In his rookie campaign, he took over as the Pistons starting shooting guard roughly midway through the season, replacing incumbent starter John Long. He was named to the 1985–86 NBA All-Rookie first team.

Dumars won two NBA championships as a player in 1989 and 1990. In the 1988–89 regular season, he averaged over 17 points per game on 50.5% field goal shooting, while dishing out a career-high 5.7 assists per game as the Pistons posted a then-team record 63 wins. They cruised through the playoffs and faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals for a second straight year. Dumars was voted the 1989 Finals MVP, after averaging 27.3 points per game during the Pistons four-game sweep of the Lakers.

In the 1990 postseason, Dumars won accolades during the Eastern Conference Finals when, with Dennis Rodman, he was a cornerstone of coach Chuck Daly&#x27;s &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; defensive playbook, which forced the Chicago Bulls to change their offensive strategy to include less of Michael Jordan and more of the other members of the team. According to Jordan, Dumars was the best defender he ever faced in the NBA. In the 1990 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, Dumars averaged 20.6 points, including 33 points in a pivotal Game 3 win that took place the same day his father had died. With his father&#x27;s death imminent, Dumars had instructed his wife, Debbie, not to tell him any news about his condition until after the game. However, Debbie did tell Isiah Thomas, who told the rest of the team. After the game, Thomas spoke about an off-balance prayer Dumars tossed up that somehow went in the basket, saying his first thought was, &quot;Your father put that one in, Joe.&quot;

During his career, he was selected to the All-Star team six times, and to the All-Defensive first team four times. He led the Pistons in points per game four straight seasons (1990–91 through 1993–94). The 1992–93 season saw Dumars set career highs in points (1,809) and points per game (23.5) while averaging a career-high 40.2 minutes per game. In 14 seasons, all with the Pistons, Dumars scored 16,401 points, handed out 4,612 assists, grabbed 2,203 rebounds and recorded 902 steals.

Although he was a member of the famed &quot;Bad Boys&quot; teams known for their aggressive play and demeanor, he became personally known for his quiet and upstanding behavior. He was the recipient of the first NBA Sportsmanship Award for the 1995–96 season. In 2000, this award was renamed the Joe Dumars Trophy.

His number 4 jersey was retired by the Pistons in March 2000. He has the distinction as being the only Pistons player to ever wear this number since the team moved to Detroit.

He played for the US national team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal.

==Executive career==
===Detroit Pistons (2000–2014)===
Dumars became the Pistons&#x27; president of basketball operations prior to the start of the 2000–01 season. He was voted the league&#x27;s Executive of the Year for the 2002–03 season and quietly went on to build the team that won the 2004 NBA championship. With the win, Dumars became the first African-American executive to lead a team to an NBA championship. During the 2005–06 season, the Pistons had its best regular season record in franchise history (64–18). The Pistons made it to the Eastern Conference Finals six straight years (2003–2008) under Dumars&#x27; watch. This streak would come to an end in the 2008–09 season when the Pistons were swept in the first round by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

On February 9, 2014, Dumars fired Maurice Cheeks as head coach and appointed John Loyer as interim head coach. On April 14, 2014, the Pistons announced that Dumars would step down as president of basketball operations yet remain as an advisor to the organization and its ownership team. During his 14 years as President, Dumars guided the organization to a 595–536 (.527) regular-season record, 73 playoff wins, six Eastern Conference Finals appearances (2003–08), six Central Division titles, two Eastern Conference Championships (2004 and 2005) and the 2004 NBA championship.

===Sacramento Kings (2019–2022)===
On June 21, 2019, Dumars was named special advisor to the general manager of the Sacramento Kings. On August 14, 2020, Dumars was named interim executive vice president of basketball operations. On September 17, 2020, he was named chief strategy officer.

===NBA (2022–present)===
On May 2, 2022, Dumars was named executive vice president and head of basketball operations for the NBA.

==Business interests==
Dumars was majority owner as well as CEO and President of Detroit Technologies for approximately 10 years. Founded by Dumars in 1996, Detroit Technologies is an automotive supply company. He sold off his interest in the company in 2006 to pursue other business interests and focus on his role as the Pistons&#x27; president of basketball operations.

Dumars was the founder and owner of the Joe Dumars Fieldhouse, an indoor sports and entertainment facility located in Shelby Township and Detroit. The Shelby Township location permanently closed in August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the original location in Detroit closing in May 2022.

In August 2017, Dumars joined Independent Sports &amp; Entertainment, an integrated sports, media and entertainment management agency, as president of its basketball division.

<text>Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark is a non-violent Christian first-person shooter developed and published by Wisdom Tree for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1994 and MS-DOS in 1995. Its gameplay is similar to that of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, as Wisdom Tree had licensed that game&#x27;s engine from id Software. Wisdom Tree opted not to secure a license from Nintendo for the game&#x27;s SNES release. While not illegal, it prevented the game from being sold at most video game retailers, which were under a contractual agreement with Nintendo not to sell unlicensed games for the company&#x27;s consoles. As a result, the SNES release of &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; was sold primarily via Christian bookstores.

The game was re-released for Windows, macOS, and Linux on itch.io on May 26, 2014 and Steam on June 23, 2015.

==Gameplay==
The game plays similarly to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, but the graphics were changed to reflect a non-violent theme. Instead of killing Nazi soldiers in a castle, the player takes the part of Noah, wandering the Ark, using a slingshot to shoot sleep-inducing food at angry attacking animals, mostly goats, in order to render them unconscious. The animals behave differently: goats, the most common enemy, will only kick Noah, while the other animals such as sheep, ostriches, antelopes and oxen will shoot spittle at him from a distance. Goats are also unable to open doors, while the other animals can.

The gameplay is aimed at young children. &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; includes secret passages, food, weapons and extra lives. There are secret levels, and shortcut levels as well. The player eventually comes across larger and more powerful slingshots, and flings coconuts and watermelon at the larger boss-like animals, such as Ernie the Elephant and Carl the Camel.

==Development==
The game that would eventually become &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; was originally conceived as a licensed game based on the film &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, a movie that Wisdom Tree founder Dan Lawton was a great fan of. Wisdom Tree acquired the game rights to &quot;Hellraiser&quot; for $50,000, along with a license to use the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; game engine from id Software, believing that the fast, violent action of &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; would be a good match for the mood of the film. Development initially began on the Nintendo Entertainment System, with Wisdom Tree intending to ship the game on a special cartridge that came equipped with a co-processor that could increase the system&#x27;s RAM and processing speed several times over.

Eventually the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; game concept was abandoned due to several issues: the hardware of the NES was found unsuitable because of its low color palette and the addition of a co-processor would have made the cartridge far too expensive for consumers. According to Vance Kozik of Wisdom Tree, little progress was made on the NES incarnation of the game, which he described as &quot;a barely up-and-running demo&quot;. The platform for &quot;Hellraiser&quot; was then switched to the PC, and the developers were able to make more progress on this version. However, by the time the first prototype was finished, &quot;Doom&quot; had been released, and Wisdom Tree felt that &quot;Hellraiser&quot; would not be able to compete. In addition, the management at Wisdom Tree decided that developing and publishing a horror-themed game would clash with their religious, family-friendly image. With these factors in mind, Wisdom Tree decided to let their &quot;Hellraiser&quot; license expire, transfer development to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and redesign the game with a Christian theme, eventually coming up with a game about Noah&#x27;s Ark.

As the game was not officially sanctioned by Nintendo, Wisdom Tree devised a pass-through system similar to the Game Genie to bypass the system&#x27;s copy protection, where the player had to insert an officially licensed SNES game into the cartridge slot on top of the &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; cartridge.

A popular rumor claims that id Software licensed the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine to Wisdom Tree in retaliation against Nintendo for the content restrictions Nintendo placed on the Super NES version of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. In actuality, Wisdom Tree offered id Software very lucrative terms for the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; game engine, which id regarded as having already outlived its usefulness, and id staff have stated that they never had any problems with Nintendo in the first place.

==Re-release==
In January 2014, to mark the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Wisdom Tree licensed the game to Piko Interactive for a digital re-release and a SNES cartridge reproduction run. Cartridges were initially available to order via email before an order page was established on the Piko Interactive website. The digital re-release, dubbed the &#x27;20th Anniversary Edition&#x27;, used the ECWolf source port developed for &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and &quot;ZDoom&quot; to support modern controllers and enable widescreen gameplay. Developed for Windows, macOS, and Linux, the game released on itch.io on May 26, 2014 and Steam on June 23, 2015. The digital re-release also includes digital copies of the game&#x27;s original SNES and MS-DOS versions for use in emulators.

<doc id="540654" wikidata="Q472096" url="?curid=540654" title="Body Heat">
<text>Body Heat is a 1981 American neo-noir erotic thriller film written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan in his directorial debut. It stars William Hurt and Kathleen Turner, featuring Richard Crenna, Ted Danson, J. A. Preston and Mickey Rourke. The film was inspired by the classic film noir &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), in turn based on the 1943 novel of the same name.

The film launched Turner&#x27;s career—&quot;Empire&quot; magazine cited the film in 1995 when it named her one of the &quot;100 Sexiest Stars in Film History&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2005 that, propelled by her &quot;jaw-dropping movie debut [in] &quot;Body Heat&quot; ... she built a career on adventurousness and frank sexuality born of robust physicality&quot;.

==Plot==
In South Florida, womanizing low-rent lawyer Ned Racine begins an affair with Matty Walker, the young wife of shady businessman Edmund Walker. The affair quickly becomes a consuming passion, but the two take care to keep it secret. Matty tells Ned that she wants a divorce, but a prenuptial agreement would leave her without Edmund&#x27;s fortune. When she wishes Edmund dead, Ned suggests murdering him. Matty says she wants to forge a new will, but Ned warns her that would attract suspicion.

By chance, Ned runs into Matty and Edmund at a restaurant. Matty introduces Ned as a lawyer who has been asking about buying the Walkers&#x27; house. The three have dinner, during which Edmund states he would kill any man who was having an affair with his wife.

Ned meets an old client, bombmaker Teddy Lewis, who builds him an incendiary device. Ned fabricates an alibi by traveling to Miami, where he checks into a hotel and then drives back home in the night. After Ned kills Edmund, he and Matty move the body to an abandoned building that Edmund owns. Ned sets the bomb to destroy Edmund&#x27;s body and mislead the police. Ned and Matty then part and agree to have no contact until Matty takes possession of the estate.

Soon after, Edmund&#x27;s lawyer calls Ned about Edmund&#x27;s new will, which had supposedly been drafted by Ned; the will was supposedly witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson, a woman Ned once met in passing but who is nowhere to be found. The new will has been improperly prepared, violating the rule against perpetuities, and the local judge, with a poor opinion of Ned, nullifies it, leaving Matty the sole beneficiary. Ned realizes Matty has disregarded his warning and forged the will, calculating it would be nullified. Matty pleads for forgiveness, pledging her love for Ned.

The case is investigated by Ned&#x27;s friends, prosecutor Peter Lowenstein and detective Oscar Grace. They suspect Matty is involved in her husband&#x27;s death and warn Ned against seeing her; Ned begins openly dating Matty to throw them off. The police deduce Edmund was not killed at the arson scene because his glasses were missing. Also, Matty appears to have lied about Simpson. Oscar begins to suspect Ned when he realizes Ned&#x27;s alibi in Miami does not hold. Edmund&#x27;s niece, who once caught Matty and Ned having sex, is brought to the police but does not recognize Ned.

Increasingly nervous and questioning Matty&#x27;s loyalty, Ned happens upon an acquaintance who says he had recommended Ned to Matty. Later, Teddy tells Ned about a woman who wanted to know how to rig a bomb to a door. Matty calls Ned, saying her maid had agreed to return the incriminating glasses after she paid her off. She asks Ned to pick up the glasses from her boathouse. There, Ned spots a wire attached to the door. Matty arrives, and Ned asks her to get the glasses instead. Oscar arrives and observes their interaction. Matty walks toward the boathouse, which then explodes. A body found inside is identified from dental records as Matty&#x27;s.

Now in prison, Ned tries to convince Oscar that &quot;Matty&quot; is still alive, believing that she had assumed the real Matty&#x27;s identity to conceal her past from Edmund. Ned surmises the &quot;Mary Ann Simpson&quot; that Ned previously met had discovered the scheme and was blackmailing Matty, only to be murdered, her body planted in the boathouse. Had Ned been killed in the explosion, the police would have found both suspects&#x27; bodies and closed the case. Oscar is not convinced and reminds Ned that he actually did kill Edmund.

Ned obtains a copy of Matty&#x27;s high school yearbook: in it are photos of Mary Ann Simpson and Matty Tyler, confirming his suspicion. Below Mary Ann&#x27;s photo is the nickname &quot;The Vamp&quot; and &quot;Ambition—To be rich and live in an exotic land&quot;. The real Mary Ann is seen lounging on a tropical beach living a new life.

==Cast==

In addition, the director&#x27;s wife, Meg Kasdan, has a brief cameo as one of Racine&#x27;s sexual partnersa nurse seen getting ready to leave his apartment.

==Production==
Kasdan &quot;wanted this film to have the intricate structure of a dream, the density of a good novel, and the texture of recognizable people in extraordinary circumstances.&quot; George Lucas acted as uncredited executive producer following successful collaborations with Kasdan as a scriptwriter on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Christopher Reeve turned down the role of Ned Racine, which eventually went to his friend, William Hurt; Reeve would later regret the decision, though he was &quot;glad for&quot; his friend. Gail Matthius from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; auditioned for Turner&#x27;s role.

A substantial portion of the film was shot in east-central Palm Beach County, Florida, including downtown Lake Worth and in the oceanside enclave of Manalapan. Additional scenes were shot on Hollywood Beach, Florida, such as the scene set in a band shell.

There was originally more graphic and extensive sex scene footage, but this was shown only in an early premiere, including in West Palm Beach, the area where it was filmed, and was later edited out for wider distribution. In an interview, &quot;Body Heat&quot; film editor Carol Littleton says, &quot;Obviously, there was more graphic footage. But we felt that less was more.&quot;

==Music==
In late 1980, Lawrence Kasdan met with four composers whose works he had admired, but only John Barry presented ideas which were close to the director&#x27;s own. 10 demos were recorded on March 31 and Barry wrote the whole score during April and early May 1981. The composer provided several themes and leitmotifs—the most memorable was &quot;Main Theme&quot;, heard during the main titles and representing Matty.

Barry worked closely with recording sessions engineer Dan Wallin to mix the soundtrack album, but for several reasons J.S Lasher (who produced the limited-edition LP and CD) remixed multitracks himself without Barry&#x27;s or Wallin&#x27;s participation.

J.S Lasher&#x27;s album was released several times: as a 45 RPM (Southern Cross LXSE 1.002) in 1983 and as a CD (Label X LXCD 2) in 1989. Both editions also included &#x27;Ladd Company Logo&#x27; composed and conducted by John Williams.

In 1998, Varèse Sarabande released a re-recording by Joel McNeely and the London Symphony Orchestra. This CD contained several new tracks (versus J.S Lasher&#x27;s editions), but still was not complete.

In August 2012, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; released a definitive two-disc edition: the complete score with alternate, unused, and source cues on disc 1, and the original, Barry-authorized album and theme demos on disc 2.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Body Heat&quot; was a commercial success. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $24.1million at the box office, against a budget of $9million.

===Critical response===
Upon its release, Richard Corliss wrote &quot;&quot;Body Heat&quot; has more narrative drive, character congestion and sense of place than any original screenplay since &quot;Chinatown&quot;, yet it leaves room for some splendid young actors to breathe, to collaborate in creating the film&#x27;s texture&quot;; it is &quot;full of meaty characters and pungent performances—Ted Danson as a tap-dancing prosecutor, J.A. Preston as a dogged detective, and especially Mickey Rourke as a savvy young ex-con who looks and acts as if he could be Ned&#x27;s sleazier twin brother.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote &quot;&quot;Body Heat&quot; is an engrossing, mightily stylish meller in which sex and crime walk hand-in-hand down the path to tragedy, just like in the old days. Working in the imposing shadow of the late James M. Cain, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan makes an impressively confident directorial debut&quot;. Roger Ebert included the film on his &quot;10 Best List&quot; for the year.

Janet Maslin wrote that &quot;Body Heat&quot; was &quot;skillfully, though slavishly, derived&quot; from 1940s film noir classics; she stated that, &quot;Mr. Hurt does a wonderful job of bringing Ned to life,&quot; but was not impressed by Turner&#x27;s performance:Sex is all-important to &quot;Body Heat&quot;, as its title may indicate. And beyond that there isn&#x27;t much to move the story along or to draw these characters together. A great deal of the distance between [Ned and Matty] can be attributed to the performance of Miss Turner, who looks like the quintessential forties siren, but sounds like the soap-opera actress she is. Miss Turner keeps her chin high in the air, speaks in a perfect monotone, and never seems to move from the position in which Mr. Kasdan has left her.

Pauline Kael dismissed the film, citing its &quot;insinuating, hotted-up dialogue that it would be fun to hoot at if only the hushed, sleepwalking manner of the film didn&#x27;t make you cringe or yawn&quot;. Ebert responded to Kael&#x27;s negative review when he added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list: Yes, Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981) is aware of the films that inspired it—especially Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944). But it has a power that transcends its sources. It exploits the personal style of its stars to insinuate itself; Kael is unfair to Turner, who in her debut role played a woman so sexually confident that we can believe her lover (William Hurt) could be dazed into doing almost anything for her. The moment we believe that, the movie stops being an exercise and starts working.

John Simon of &quot;National Review&quot; described &quot;Body Heat&quot; as &#x27;derivative and odious&#x27;.

In a home video review for Turner Classic Movies, Glenn Erickson called it &quot;arguably the first conscious Neo Noir&quot;; he wrote &quot;Too often described as a quickie remake of &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;Body Heat&quot; is more detailed in structure and more pessimistic about human nature. The noir hero for the Reagan years is ...more like the self-defeating Al Roberts of Edgar Ulmer&#x27;s &quot;Detour&quot;&quot;. &quot;Body Heat&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 96% approval rating based on 47 reviews, and an average rating of 8.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;Made from classic noir ingredients and flavored with a heaping helping of steamy modern spice, &quot;Body Heat&quot; more than lives up to its evocative title.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – No. 92
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – No. 94

Rourke earned critical acclaim for his performance, which helped him evolve from character actor to movie star.

==Home media==
Warner Bros. released a 25th-anniversary Deluxe Edition DVD of &quot;Body Heat&quot;, including a documentary about the film by Laurent Bouzereau, a &quot;number of rightfully deleted scenes&quot;, and a trailer.

<text>The Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB), formally known as the Society of Saint Francis de Sales (), is a religious congregation of men in the Catholic Church, founded in 1859 by the Italian priest John Bosco to help poor and migrant youngsters during the Industrial Revolution. The congregation was named after Francis de Sales, a 17th-century bishop of Geneva.

The Salesians&#x27; charter describes the society&#x27;s mission as &quot;the Christian perfection of its associates obtained by the exercise of spiritual and corporal works of charity towards the young, especially the poor, and the education of boys to the priesthood&quot;. Its associated women&#x27;s institute is the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco, while the lay movement is the Association of Salesian Cooperators.

==History==

In 1845 Don John Bosco (&quot;Don&quot; being a traditional Italian honorific for priest) opened a night school for boys in Valdocco, now part of the municipality of Turin in Italy. In the following years, he opened several more schools, and in 1857 drew up a set of rules for his helpers. Bosco admired the simple spirituality and philosophy of kindness of Francis de Sales and established the Society of St. Francis de Sales in his honor in 1859.

The rule was approved definitively in 1873 by Pope Pius IX as the Rule of the Society of Saint Francis de Sales. The Society grew rapidly, with houses established in France and Argentina within a year of the Society&#x27;s formal recognition. Its official print organ, &quot;Salesian Bulletin,&quot; was first published in 1877.

Over the next decade the Salesians expanded into Austria, Britain, Spain, and several countries in South America. The death of Don Bosco in 1888 did not slow down the Society&#x27;s growth. The Salesians arrived in Mexico and established their first institution in 1892 and in 1894 arrived in Portugal. By 1911 the Salesians were established throughout the world, including Colombia, China, India, South Africa, Tunisia, Venezuela and the United States.

==Present day==
The Society continues to operate worldwide; in 2021, it counted 14,232 members in 1,703 houses. As of 2023, Salesians are present in more than 130 countries.

==Symbols==

=== Coat of arms ===
The Salesian coat of arms was designed by Professor Boidi. It was published for the first time in a circular letter of Don Bosco on 8 December 1885. It consist of a shining star, the large anchor, and the heart on fire to symbolize the theological virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity. The figure of Saint Francis de Sales recalls the patron of the society. The small wood in the lower part refers to the founder of the society; the high mountains signify the heights of perfection towards which members strive; the interwoven palm and laurel that enfold the shield on either side are emblematic of the prize reserved for a virtuous and sacrificial life. The motto &quot;Da mihi animas, caetera tolle&quot; (&quot;Give me souls, take away the rest&quot;) is featured at the bottom.

===Logo===

The Salesian logo is made up of two superimposed images. The logo combines elements from those of the German and Brazilian provinces. The idea of combining the two came out of suggestions from an enquiry about the new logo conducted throughout the Congregation and from contributions by the General Council. It is designed with the central theme &quot;Don Bosco and the Salesians walking with the young through the world.&quot; The artistic work of combining the two was carried out by the designer Fabrizio Emigli, from the Litos Company, in Rome.

In the background is a globe to represent the worldwide reach of the Salesians, and a stylized &quot;S&quot; in white is formed within the globe, resembling a snaking road representing an educational journey for the youth.

In the foreground is an arrow pointing upwards, resting on three perpendicular legs on top of which are three closed circles, making a stylized image of three people: the first of these in the middle and taller than the others is the point of the arrow, and the other two beside it appear as it were to be embraced by the central figure. These three stylized figures represent Saint John Bosco reaching out to the young, and his call for Salesians to continue his work. The three stylized figures with the arrow pointing upwards can also be viewed as a house dwelling with a sloping roof and three pillars holding it up, represents John Bosco&#x27;s pedagogy of Reason, Religion and Loving Kindness.
===Organization===
 The Salesians of Don Bosco are headed by the Rector Major and the society&#x27;s general council, while each of the ninety-four geographical provinces is headed by a Provincial. These officers serve six-year terms; the Rector Major and the members of the general council are elected by the General Chapter, which meets every six years or upon the death of the Rector Major. Each local Salesian community is headed by a superior, called a Rector (or more commonly, &quot;Director&quot;), who is appointed to a three-year term and can be renewed for a second three-year term.

From 2014 to 2024, the Rector Major of the Salesians was the Very Reverend Father and later Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime.

==Works==
Salesian communities primarily operate shelters for homeless or at-risk youths; schools; technical, vocational, and language instruction centers for youths and adults; and boys&#x27; clubs and community centers. In some areas they run parish churches. Salesians are also active in publishing and other public communication activities, as well as mission work, especially in Asia (Siberia - in the Yakutsk area), Africa, and South America (Yanomami). The &quot;Salesian Bulletin&quot; is now published in fifty-two editions, in thirty languages.

In 1988, the Salesians branched to create the Salesian Youth Movement. Then in the 1990s, the Salesians launched new works in the area of tertiary education, and today have a network of over 58 colleges and universities. The official university of the Salesian Society is the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome.

A number of schools and churches established under the Salesians have been at the center of child sex abuse scandals, including Mary Help of Christians in Tampa, Florida. Due to ongoing sexual assault lawsuits and settlements, several boarding schools were closed.

<doc id="540661" wikidata="Q561921" url="?curid=540661" title="Danny Federici">
<text>Daniel Paul Federici (January 23, 1950 – April 17, 2008) was an American musician, best known as a founding member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, where he was its organist, accordionist and glockenspiel player. Federici appeared on ten of Springsteen&#x27;s studio albums.

In 2014, Federici was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band.

==Career==
Federici started to play accordion when he was seven years old, which he learned from watching &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. When he mastered classical music and polka, his mother booked him at parties, clubs and on radio. While he continued his studies in classical accordion, he gained an interest in jazz and blues, after he heard a professor at the Neupauer Conservatory of Music in Philadelphia play those styles on accordion.

During in-concert band intros, Springsteen often referred to him as &quot;Phantom&quot;, sometimes said to be because of an incident in Asbury Park in the 1960s where Federici evaded a police crackdown that resulted in the arrest of numerous others. Federici attended Hunterdon Central High School in New Jersey. When he, along with Vini Lopez, started the band Child at the end of the 1960s, their choice for a singer fell on Bruce Springsteen; Federici also joined Springsteen in other early efforts such as Steel Mill.

Federici&#x27;s organ fills are a key component in the E Street sound, and sometimes take on a more prominent role, such as on the hit &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;. He pioneered the trademark E Street glockenspiel sound with a rare keyboard glockenspiel known as a Jenco Celestette, which Danny would perch atop his Hammond B3 Organ. The design is unique in that there are resonator tubes similar to those of vibes protruding vertically from the top in staggered lengths resembling calliope or organ pipes, amplifying the horizontal xylophone-like bell bars below which were struck by keyboard actuated hammers much like a piano&#x27;s. He subsequently used electronic keyboards to simulate the glockenspiel sound. Another notable performance is his accordion solo on &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot;. It was reported in an interview in &quot;Backstreets Magazine&quot; that Federici did not have the best working relationship while playing with pianist David Sancious in the early days of the E Street Band, because Sancious would comment on Federici&#x27;s parts and constantly tell him what to play and what not to play. &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; published an article in 2008 detailing the instrumentation Danny used. 

During the long time the E Street Band was inactive during the 1990s, Federici played with Country/Americana act Diamondback, releasing one record with Diamondback during this period, &quot;Ragin Wind&quot;. Federici&#x27;s haunting accordion and B3 work became an integral component of their Southern Rock sound, and he co-wrote several tracks with lead singer Franklin Jenkins. During this time Federici recorded a solo album of jazz instrumentals called &quot;Flemington&quot;, after his hometown of Flemington, New Jersey. E-Street bandmates, bassist Garry Tallent and guitarist Nils Lofgren supplied backup on the album. This was originally released on Deadeye Records (which he co-owned with Diamondback members Jenkins and Ben Arrington), then picked up by Music Masters Jazz label in 1997; it was later re-worked and re-issued as &quot;Danny Federici&quot; on Hip-O Records in 2001. Federici followed this up with a smooth jazz album &quot;Sweet&quot;, self-released on Backstreets.com in 2004; it was re-issued as &quot;Out of a Dream&quot; on V2 Records in 2005. Federici performed on other artists&#x27; records as well, including those of Joan Armatrading, Graham Parker, Gary U.S. Bonds and Garland Jeffreys.

== Illness and death ==
On November 21, 2007, it was announced that Federici would take a leave of absence from Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s ongoing Magic Tour to pursue treatment for melanoma, and was temporarily replaced by veteran musician Charles Giordano. Springsteen stated at the time: &quot;Danny is one of the pillars of our sound and has played beside me as a great friend for more than 40 years. We all eagerly await his healthy and speedy return.&quot;

Federici made his only return to the stage on March 20, 2008, when he appeared for portions of a Springsteen and E Street Band performance at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Federici died on April 17, 2008, at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, having suffered for three years with melanoma. Springsteen&#x27;s album &quot;Working on a Dream&quot; is dedicated to him. Federici&#x27;s final show with the band on November 19, 2007, was released as an archival recording on nugs.net. Federici was featured as soloist on organ and accordion more than he usually was, and Springsteen gives a special introduction to him, to great audience response.

==The Danny Federici Melanoma Fund==
The Danny Federici Melanoma Fund was started after his death, and is dedicated to the research and development of treatments for melanoma through funding for clinical trials at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The fund also aims to help raise awareness for the disease.

On July 15, 2008, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, through Columbia Records, released an EP of audio and video tracks for digital download, entitled &quot;Magic Tour Highlights&quot;, with all proceeds going to the fund. The tracks are taken from the Magic Tour, and feature a performance of &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; from Federici&#x27;s final March 20 Indianapolis appearance with the band.

<text>The tanpura (; also referred to as tambura, tanpuri, tamboura, or tanpoura) is a long-necked, plucked, four-stringed instrument originating in the Indian subcontinent, found in various forms in Indian music. Visually, the tanpura resembles a simplified sitar or similar lute-like instrument, and is likewise crafted out of a gourd or pumpkin.

The tanpura does not play a melody, but rather creates a meditative ambience, supporting and sustaining the performance of another musician or vocalist, as well as for musicians accompanying a dance performance. The instrument&#x27;s four strings are tuned to specific notes of a given scale or musical key, normally the fifth (&quot;Pa&quot;; Solfège, “So”) and the root tonic (&quot;Sa&quot;; “Do”). The strings are generally tuned 5-8-8-1. One of the three strings tuned to the tonic is thus an octave below the others, adding greater resonance and depth to the ambient drone.

Through continuous, rhythmic plucking of its strings, the tanpura creates a constant harmonic bourdon or drone effect. Uniquely, the tanpura is not played in specific rhythm with the soloist, percussionist, or any other featured musician; the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound, and it is played, unchangingly, throughout the whole performance. Tanpurists must keep true to their own rhythm for the duration of the composition, which may be over an hour in some cases, as their drone is critical to the entire musical foundation of the performance. The repeated cycle of plucking the strings in succession creates a sonic canvas on which the melody of the raga (or other composition) is drawn. The sequence of string-plucking is generally (according to pitch) 5-8-8-1, with the fourth and final string plucked being given a slight “rest”, usually two to three seconds, before repeating the cycle. The combined sound of all strings–each string a fundamental tone with its own spectrum of overtones–supports and blends with the external tones sung or played by the soloist.

Northern and central-Indian Hindustani musicians favor the term &quot;tanpura&quot; (often used within the context of languages such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Sindhi, Punjabi, etc.), whereas southern and Carnatic musicians normally prefer &quot;tambura&quot; (for example, in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, or Telugu); &quot;tanpuri&quot; is a smaller variant of the instrument, sometimes used for accompanying instrumental soloists.

==History==
Tanpuras form the root of the ensemble and indeed of the music itself, as the tanpura creates an acoustic dynamic reference chord from which the ragas (melodic modes) derive their distinctive character, color, and flavor. Stephen Slawek notes that by the end of the 16th century, the tanpura had &quot;fully developed in its modern form&quot; and was seen in the miniature paintings of the Mughals. Slawek further suggests that due to structural similarity the sitar and tanpura share a related history.

An electronic tanpura, a small box that imitates the sound of a tanpura, is sometimes used in contemporary Indian classical music performances instead of a tanpura, though this practice is controversial.

===Tanpura makers===
The sitar maker family of Miraj is regarded as the finest producers of tanpuras in the world. The family has been making tanpuras for over seven generations from 1850.

== Construction ==
The body shape of the tanpura somewhat resembles that of the sitar, but it has no frets – as the strings are always plucked at their full lengths. One or more tanpuras may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists. It has four or five (rarely six) metal strings, which are plucked one after another in a regular pattern to create a harmonic resonance on the basic notes of a key.

==Bridge and strings==
The overtone-rich sound and the audible movement in the inner resonances of tone is achieved by applying the principle of &quot;Jivari&quot; which creates a sustained &quot;buzzing&quot; sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused clarity. To achieve this effect, the strings pass over a table-shaped, curved-top bridge, the front of which slopes gently away from the surface of the strings. When a string is plucked, it has an intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge. When the string moves up and down, the downward wave will touch a far point on the curve of the bridge, and as the energy of motion of the string gradually diminishes, these points of contact of the string on the bridge will gradually shift as well, being a compound function of amplitude, the curvature of the bridge, pitch, string tension and time. When the string is plucked, it has a large amplitude. As the energy of the string&#x27;s movement gradually diminishes, the contact point of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge. Depending on scale, tension and pitch, this can take between three and ten seconds.

This dynamic process can be fine-tuned using a cotton thread between string and bridge: by shifting the thread, the grazing contact sequence is shifted to a different position on the bridge, changing the harmonic content. Every single string produces its own cascading range of harmonics and, at the same time, builds up a particular resonance. According to this principle, tanpuras are attentively tuned to achieve a particular tonal shade relative to the tonal characteristics of the raga. These more delicate aspects of tuning are directly related to what Indian musicians call &quot;raga Svaroop&quot;, which is about how characteristic intonations are important defining aspects of a particular raga. The tanpura&#x27;s particular setup, with the cotton thread as a variable focus-point, made it possible to explore a multitude of harmonic relations produced by the subtle harmonic interplay in time of its four strings.

==Sizes and tunings==
Tanpuras come in different sizes and pitches: larger &quot;males&quot;, smaller &quot;females&quot; for vocalists, and a yet smaller version is used for accompanying sitar or sarod, called &quot;tanpuri&quot;. These play at the octave so as not to drown out the soloist&#x27;s lower registers.

Male vocalists use the biggest instruments and pitch their tonic note (&quot;Sa&quot;), often at D, C or lower, some go down to B-flat; female singers usually a fifth higher, though these tonic notes may vary according to the preference of the singer, as there is no absolute and fixed pitch-reference in the Indian Classical music systems. One female singer may take her &#x27;sa&#x27; at F, another at A, Sitaras tune mostly around C, sarodiyas around C, Sarangiyas vary more between D and F, and Bansuriyas mostly play from E.

The male tanpura has an open string length of approximately one metre; the female is three-fourths of the male. The standard tuning is 5-8-8-1 (so do′ do′ do) or, in Indian sargam, Pa-sa-sa-Sa. For ragas that omit the fifth tone, pa, the first string is tuned down to the natural fourth: 4-8-8-1 or Ma-sa-sa-Sa. Some ragas that omit Pa and shuddha Ma, such as Marwa or Hindol, require a less common tuning with shuddha Dha (major 6th), DHA-sa-sa-SA or 6-8-8-1, or with the 7th, NI-s-s-S. With a five-string instrument, the seventh or NI (major or minor 7th) can be added: PA-NI-sa-sa-SA (5-7-8-8-1)or MA-NI-sa-sa-SA (4-7-8-8-1). Both minor and major 7th harmonics are clearly distinguishable in the harmonic texture of the overall sound, so when the Ni - strings are tuned into these harmonics, the resultant sound will be perfectly harmonious.

Usually the octave strings are in steel wire, and the tonic, 4th or 5th strings in brass or bronze wire. If a string will be tuned to the 6th or 7th, a steel string is advised instead.

== Variants ==
Tanpuras are designed in two different styles:
*&quot;Miraj style&quot;: the favorite form of tanpura for Hindustani performers. It is usually between three and five feet in length, with a carved, rounded resonator plate (&quot;tabli&quot;) and a long, hollow straight neck, in section resembling a rounded capital D. The round lower chamber to which the tabli, the connecting heel-piece and the neck (&quot;dandh&quot;) are fixed is cut from a selected and dried gourd (&quot;tumba&quot;). Wood used is either tun or teak; bridges are usually cut from one piece of bone.
*&quot;Tanjore style&quot;: this is a south Indian style of tambura, used widely by Carnatic performers. It has a somewhat different shape and style of decoration from that of the Miraj, but is otherwise much the same size. Typically, no gourd is used, but the spherical part is gouged out of a solid block of wood. The neck is somewhat smaller in diameter. Jack wood is used throughout; bridges are usually cut from one piece of rosewood. Often, two rosettes are drilled out and ornamented with inlay work.

<text>Notaphily is the study and collection of paper currency, and banknotes. A notaphilist is a collector of banknotes or paper money, particularly as a hobby.

==History==
It is believed that people have been collecting paper money for as long as it has been in use. Notable early collectors include Maberly Phillips (1838-1923), Henry Strakosch (1871-1943), Fred Catling 1873-1947), Arnold Keller (1897-1972) and Albert Pick (1922-2015). While people began collecting paper currency more systematically in the 1940s, the turning point occurred in the 1970s when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. 

The term was coined in 1970 by Robert Stanley, a linguist then employed as Public Relations Manager of the collectors and investments firm Stanley Gibbons, in a successful attempt to formalise and encourage interest in the area. The term &#x27;philanoty&#x27; had been considered, but &#x27;notaphily&#x27; was preferred because of its assonance with the familiar &#x27;philately&#x27;.

At the same time, some developed countries such as the United States, Germany and France began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.

In 1961, The International Bank Note Society, (IBNS), was formed as an international association of banknote collectors. Nowadays it has thousands of members from around the world. The IBNS publishes the quarterly IBNS Journal, holds regular mail bid auctions, and promotes lectures at congresses.

The major contributor to this study has been Albert Pick who published some of the earliest catalogues of paper money and through them explained the objective of collecting paper money and the definition of it. Albert Pick is also the author of the capital part of the &quot;Standard Catalog of World Paper Money&quot;, now a three-volume set which consists of thousands of pages of almost the entire collection of the world paper money that has ever existed and is updated annually. Almost every note of every country and many special and regional issues are cataloged following a unique format for each entry: [Country Name]P[unique number for the banknote edition]

The following note would thus be cataloged as &quot;Yugoslavia P-87.&quot;

An important aspect of collecting banknotes is the condition of items. Banknotes in perfect condition (without any damage), that usually haven&#x27;t circulated are rated as uncirculated (UNC) and that is the highest classification for a value that a banknote can have. In addition to that, the value for a specific note in the world paper money catalog is listed for UNC condition.

==Authentication, grading and cataloging==
Banknotes are usually graded on a descriptive scale of grades. These grades vary somewhat internationally, and as time goes on more grades have been added. The grades specified by the International Bank Note Society are as follows:

* Uncirculated (UNC) - refers to a banknote that is bright and has no handling damage, such as folds or creases, nor any cuts, stains, or rounded corners
* About uncirculated (AU) - a banknote that is still bright but has trivial handling damage, i.e. a light center fold (not a crease, which is a break of the fibres of the paper), without rounded corners.
* Extremely fine (XF or EF) - a banknote with one crease or up to three light folds. Paper still bright and attractive, very slight wear to corners allowed.
* Very Fine (VF) - Note still attractive, but possible slight dirt or smudging, may have several horizontal and/or vertical folds. Paper remains relatively crisp. No tears, but slight wear to edges and corners is allowable.
* Fine (F) - Paper is now slightly soft, considerable wear due to folds from use in circulation. Minor tears to note, not extending into the design. Clear but not bright in appearance. Staple holes but not holes due to folding.
* Very Good (VG) - Much wear. Paper is limp. Tears can extend into the design. Staining possible. Discoloration possible. Hole at center caused by folding allowable. Note still looks presentable.
* Good (G) - Very much wear, as VG, but more so. Graffiti on note. Small pieces of the note may be missing
* Fair - Larger pieces of note torn off/missing, compared with G. Less of the note intact.
* Poor - Severe damage due to wear, staining, missing pieces, graffiti and/or holes. May be taped together, have pieces missing. The worst possible condition.

In addition to these grades, it is common to indicate an in-between grade, such as AU-UNC, which is a note that falls between AU and UNC, (e.g., a note with a noticeable counting fold).

Certain vendors and auctioneers break the UNC grade down further, into three grades:

* Gem Uncirculated or Gem Crisp Uncirculated - A perfect note, not just in original condition, but with large equally balanced margins, outstanding colour. Thus such a note is not just as originally printed, but was also printed well in the first place.
* Choice Uncirculated/Crisp Choice Uncirculated - Just less than perfect, tiny foxing, faint counting smudges, or slightly off-center margins
* Uncirculated/Crisp Uncirculated - Still not folded or creased, but suffering from any of: slight fading, yellowing, foxing, very off-center margins, corner folds only in the blank area (not the design)

Most collectors will always prefer an Uncirculated note, and these notes command substantial premiums over lower grades. A note in UNC condition is generally worth up to ten times more in this condition compared with merely VG (Very Good). An UNC note can be worth three times as much as a VF one. For notes seldom found in uncirculated condition, the premium may be even higher. The difference between Gem Uncirculated and Uncirculated can also be substantial. As a result, buyers are at risk of grade inflation, in that a dealer failing to notice a fold in an AU note and passing it off as UNC will undoubtedly feel justified in charging a higher price.

Bank notes below VF are usually considered undesirable in a collection, and are generally purchased where better-quality examples are either unavailable due to their scarcity or simply beyond the collector&#x27;s budget. Common notes in such poor condition, however, are effectively unsaleable for anything above their face value (assuming they are still legal tender).

Various third party grading companies (TPG) offer the service of authentication, grading and cataloging of common varieties of paper currency. These TPGs typically use a seventy-point grading scale to describe the note. Additional notations may be made for exceptional paper quality or other varieties.

Following examination, TPG companies typically encapsulate the currency in what is commonly referred to as a &quot;slab.&quot; Similar to the issues surrounding the transition that occurred within the coin collecting field many years ago, controversy exists about the need or value of TPG notes. Without having the ability to closely examine and feel the note due to it being sealed inside the slab, many collectors are not comfortable accepting the opinion of others as to the grade and may either elect not to purchase the note or to cut it out of the slab for examination. Additionally, many noted mistakes in grading by third party grading services have been discovered. However, for collectors less adept at grading, purchasing a note in a slab can provide some additional comfort for the owner in justifying the purchase and cost. It also serves to help protect the collector against unethical activities designed to increase the worth of the note by pressing out folds, washing, repairing tears, or other alterations typically viewed as unacceptable thereby lowering the value of the item.

The vast majority of banknotes are sold using the Uncirculated–Poor grading system, and are never graded with any third party.

==Postal order collecting==

Postal order collecting has become a branch of notaphily, especially in England since the 1980s. Some countries, such as Basutoland, the British Somaliland Protectorate, and Northern Rhodesia never issued their own banknotes, however, they did issue their own postal orders. Great Britain, the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland also issued Old Age Pension Orders as well as postal orders. These have become collectible in recent years.

==Specialties==

People collect paper money by:
* Topic (wildlife, ships, famous people, dance)
* Time period (series, date)
* Country (native, favourite or unusual)
* Substrate (paper or polymer or hybrid)
* Currency
* Denomination
* Printer
* Serial number (ascending and descending)
* Grade
* Varieties caused by major or minor design changes
* Replacement or star notes commonly used to replace errors discovered during the printing process.
* Errors in the printing process
* Signatures 
* Colours

<doc id="540672" wikidata="Q3397397" url="?curid=540672" title="Radley">
<text>Radley is a village and civil parish about northeast of the centre of Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The parish includes the hamlet of Lower Radley on the River Thames. It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The village is home to Radley College, a famous boarding independent school for boys from the age of thirteen to eighteen that consists of 690 pupils.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of Saint James the Great was built in about 1290. The church is built of stone, but unusually its roof is supported by wooden pillars installed by a medieval Abbot of Abingdon, who was told in a vision to &quot;seek [them] in the forest&quot;. The present south aisle dates from the 14th century but the chancel, nave and bell tower were rebuilt in the 15th century. The windows contain Royal heraldic stained glass from the latter part of the 15th century and from the Tudor period. In the tower is a stained-glass portrait believed to represent King Henry VII.

The church is missing both its north aisle and transept, which were destroyed during the Civil War. The south doorway is 15th century, but an inscription on the present door states that it was made in 1656. In the chancel, there is a Renaissance style monument to the lord of the manor, Sir William Stonehouse (died 1632), made by Nicholas Stone. The canopy over the pulpit is said to have originally stood behind the Speaker&#x27;s chair in the House of Commons and was given to the church by a local man, Speaker William Lenthall, in 1643. If so, it is the canopy from under which Parliamentarian soldiers dragged Lenthall at the end of the Long Parliament. St. James&#x27; is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower has a ring of six bells. Abel Rudhall of Gloucester cast five of them including the tenor in 1754. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present treble bell in 1952. St. James&#x27; also has a Sanctus bell that Henry I Knight of Reading cast in 1617. The former vicarage next to the church was built in the 15th century. Past incumbents of the parish have included the future bishops Charles Gore (1893–95) and James Nash (1895–98).

==Radley Hall==
Abingdon Abbey held the manor of Radley until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, George Stonehouse built a house in Radley Park, but in 1727 the Stonehouse family replaced this with a new mansion, Radley Hall. Early in the 19th century the house was leased for a time as a Nonconformist school, and from 1847 it was leased to William Sewell who founded Saint Peter&#x27;s College, Radley. The school is now generally referred to as Radley College.

==Wick Hall==
Wick Hall is located between Radley and Thrupp Lake, off Audlett Drive. It is a Grade II* listed country house, built in about 1720 for the Tomkins family. The decoration includes Flemish wood panelling, taken from Exeter College chapel. The house was acquired by the Dockar-Drysdale family in 1850, and extended for them by Charles Bell in the 1870s. 

==Railway==
In 1844 the Great Western Railway opened an extension from Didcot to Oxford, passing through Radley parish. In 1873 the GWR opened Radley railway station southwest of the village. It is now served by Great Western Railway trains.
==Radley Lake==
South of the village are current and former gravel pits. The disused pits have flooded, forming a number of lakes. In 1985 the Central Electricity Generating Board began filling some of these lakes with waste ash from Didcot Power Station. In June 2005 Npower applied for permission to fill in two more lakes. Npower soon withdrew Bullfield Lake from its proposal, but continued with its proposal for the larger Thrupp Lake. Local opposition formed into a protest campaign called Save Radley Lakes. In December 2008 Npower finally announced that it &quot;no longer needed&quot; Thrupp Lake and withdrew its application.
==Amenities==
Radley has a Church of England primary school, a village hall and a Women&#x27;s Institute. There is a public house, the Bowyer Arms, controlled by Greene King Brewery. Radley Cricket Club plays in Oxfordshire Cricket Association Division Three.

==History society==
Radley has a local history society which has produced a number of publications and maintains an archive of local material. &quot;Radley vicarage&quot; by Radley History Club, 2005. A report of a &#x27;buildings record&#x27; survey and archive research undertaken to determine the history, construction, and later development of this 14th-century building &quot;The history of Radley&quot; by Patrick Drysdale … [and others] Radley History Club, 2002. History of the village from prehistory to the present.

==Notable residents==
Included among Radley&#x27;s former residents are:
Dr. Gary Botting, now an extradition lawyer in Canada, who attended the Church of England Primary School and began collecting moths in Radley in 1948.

<doc id="540684" wikidata="Q683925" url="?curid=540684" title="Hakkō-ryū">
<text>Hakkō-ryū () or Hakkō-ryū Jūjutsu () is a school or &#x27;style&#x27; of jujutsu descended from Daito-ryu founded in 1941 by Okuyama Ryuho (1901–1987) a student of Sokaku Takeda and a practitioner of shiatsu. This style of self-defense focuses on the &quot;qi&quot; meridian points sensitive to pain so that a defender can create sharp distracting pain to an attacker but without causing serious injury to the person, and it can therefore be considered a humanitarian martial technique.

The school is now headed by his son who inherited the name Nidai Soke Okuyama Ryuho. The headquarters or honbu dojo is located in Ōmiya-ku, Saitama, Saitama Prefecture.

==Meaning of the name==
Hakko Ryu in a Japanese term can be translated as &quot;The Style of the Eighth Light,&quot; or specifically &quot;eighth light school.&quot; In the color spectrum there are normally seven bands of color that are visible. &quot;Hakko&quot;, meaning the &quot;eighth light&quot;, refers to the ultraviolet band, a band of light that is invisible to human but responsible for causing sunburn while at the beach. This invisible yet powerful band of light is used as an analogy for Hakko Ryu, whereby &quot;the faint and weak in appearance comes surprising strength&quot;. The number eight can also represents infinity in Japan, the name therefore suggests an infinite number of techniques can be derived from it. &quot;Ryu&quot; means the school or system of martial art. Hakko Ryu Jujutsu training employs strategies to defend oneself using subtle movements rather than strength, yet powerful in execution, not unlike the ultraviolet rays of the sun.

==History==
Hakko Ryu was founded in 1941 by Okuyama Ryuho. Okuyama was an instructor of Daito Ryu Aikijujutsu which he studied from two people: Kyoju Dairi Matsuda (Toshimi) Hosaku and later Takeda Sokaku himself. In 1938 Okuyama finished his studies with Takeda and published a martial art text called Daito-ryu Goshinjutsu (The Daito System of Self-Protection), later founded the Dai-Nippon Shidokai (Greater Japan Way of the Samurai Association) and began teaching what he called Daito Hiden Shido (Secret Daito-Ryu Way of the Samurai). Okuyama&#x27;s first Dojo was located in Asahikawa and was called Nippon Shidokai Ryubukan. In 1939 he moved to Kanda and opened another dojo called Dai Nihon Shidokai. This marked the beginning of the split from Daito-ryu, as by this time Takeda was very old and his son Tokimune was still very young. Seeing no place for advancement in the Daito-ryu school, and being a skilled medical and martial person, Okuyama began to form his own system based on Daito-ryu Jujutsu and Daito-ryu Aiki no jutsu as well as his experience in other forms of bujutsu.

The Hakko-ryu Kaiso Hokokusai (ceremony proclaiming the founding of Hakko-ryu) was held on June 1, 1941 at the Shiba Tenso Jinja (Shinto shrine in the Shiba district of Tokyo). On that date Hakko-ryu was formed and Okuyama took the pen name Ryuho (spine of the Dragon). The Hakko-ryu Kobujuku (private school for Hakko-ryu study) was located in Kanda district of Tokyo. During World War II the allied Bombing grew close; Okuyama and his family fled and joined the Mount Haguro sect of Shugendo (a mixture of Buddhism and Shintoism) in Yamagata Prefecture. The Hakko-ryu Kobujuku burned down during the bombing of Tokyo. In 1947 he moved to Omiya City (Saitama City) and founded the Hakko-ryu So Hombu Dojo (Hakko-ryu Juku Hombu Dojo). This is the home city of Hakko-ryu today.

==Technique and schooling==
Hakko Ryu is a style of self-defence that targets the pressure points and nerves sensitive to pain. The sensitive pressure points or &quot;tsubo&quot; lie along the meridians &quot;keiraku&quot; through which the &quot;qi&quot; flows, and striking these points can create momentary intense pain. This allows the defender to control, subdue or warn off an attacker. The technique relies on efficiency rather than power and strength, and its training emphasizes stretching, flexibility, and the suppleness of the body. It employs joint techniques, but has few strikes and kicks, and &quot;tai sabaki&quot; are seen in many of its techniques. Its throws often use joint-locks and are similar to those of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu and Aikido rather than Jujutsu or Judo.

While Hakko-ryu techniques are closely related to Daito-ryu, it is the influence of Oriental medicine and a strict moral code that distinguishes the style. The Koho Igaku Shiatsu system is taught to its members at all levels and is a requirement for those holding Menkyo Shihan and higher licenses. The jujutsu system&#x27;s emphasis is placed on pressure points and manipulation of the opponent&#x27;s body through both the skeletal structure and the body&#x27;s meridians; this helps give Hakko-ryu its trademark of appearing weak but being powerful in application.

The techniques of Hakko-ryu are passed on in the form of kata or waza sets known as Ge. Each kata has a number of Omote (surface) techniques that must be learned before the student can progress to the next level. Each level also contains Kihon waza, which introduce the core principles of Hakkoryu to the student; the Omote techniques are not to be changed but handed down to the next generation, and so forth. They are as follows:

# Shodan-Gi
# Nidan-Gi
# Sandan-Gi
# Yondan-Gi

Besides the Omote, Kihon, and Gensoku Of Hakko-ryu, some subjects taught include concepts such as:

#Kamae (combative engagement posture/stance)
#Hara/Tanden/Ki (center of gravity, how it may best be concentrated)
#Kime (focus)
#Tsukuri/Kuzushi/Kake (preparing/off balancing/executing)
#Ma ai (combative engagement distance)
#Sen (combative initiative or &quot;timing&quot;)
#Suki (detecting weaknesses/openings)
After Yondan the system uses the older Koryu Menkyo licenses. A student must be invited by Okuyama to train with him in the upper waza. To obtain an invitation the student must be referred by a Shihan in good standing with the Hombu. Upon receiving the invitation, the student may travel to Japan and stay with the Okuyama family for a period of time for training or receive training from him during his visits outside Japan.

== Organization ==
Hakko-ryu is governed in an autocratic nature. Hakkoryu Jujutsu and Koho Igaku Shiatsu belong solely to the Okuyama family. Okuyama has total authority, and while he is advised by senior Shihan and councils, his word is final. This has been difficult for some to take, but especially for non-Japanese which has resulted in the expulsion of some over the years. There are few people outside Japan recognized as legitimate Shihan and teachers. Okuyama states that &quot;Some may use the word &#x27;Hakko&#x27; (八光) in the names of their systems. Interested parties are advised that many have no relationship to Hakkoryu. Many desire the legitimacy of such affiliation without the accompanying training, efforts, sacrifice, responsibilities, limitations, and burdens actual membership requires. This is true of those who have never had any training or affiliation at all with Hakkoryu as well as those who have been expelled or claim they have retired but continue to teach.&quot;

Hakkoryu is distinctly separate and apart from Hakko Denshin Ryu and other schools who use the name &quot;Hakko&quot; within the name of their schools. Hakkoryu is an internationally registered trademark.

<text>Mazatlán () is a city in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding , known as the Mazatlán Municipality. It is located on the Pacific coast across from the southernmost tip of the Baja California Peninsula.

 is a Nahuatl word for &#x27;place of deer&#x27;. The city was colonized in 1531 by the Conquistadors where many indigenous people lived. By the mid-19th century, a large group of immigrants arrived from Germany. Over time, Mazatlán developed into a commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. The German settlers also influenced the local music, banda, with some genres being an alteration of Bavarian folk music. The settlers established the Pacifico Brewery on 14 March 1900. Mazatlán has a rich culture and art community; in addition to the Angela Peralta Theater, the city has many galleries, museums and buildings of historic value.

With a population of 438,434 (city) and 489,987 (municipality) as of the 2010 census, Mazatlán is the second-largest city in the state. It is also a tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. A car ferry crosses the Gulf of California, from Mazatlán to La Paz, Baja California Sur. The municipality has a land area of and includes smaller outlying communities such as Villa Unión, La Noria, El Quelite, and El Habal. Mazatlán is served by Mazatlán International Airport.

==Etymology==
Mazatlán etymologically comes from the Nahuatl language and means &quot;Land of deer&quot; (mazatl &quot;deer&quot; and tlan referring to a place abundant with something).

Originally, the name Presidio of Mazatlán was used for what is now called Villa Unión. The port of Mazatlán served as a reference to arrive to Presidio by sea, and was called the Islands of Mazatlán. By decree of the Estado de Occidente, on September 11, 1828, Presidio of Mazatlán was renamed Villa of the Union. This freed the name Mazatlán (land of deer), and since the port was known as Islas de Mazatlán, the name was adopted.

==History==

===Early settlers===
Indigenous groups were in the region of Mazatlán prior to the arrival of the Spanish. These groups included the Totorames, who lived from the south bank of the River Piaxtla to the Río de las Cañas, as well as the Xiximes, who lived in the mountains in the bordering state of Durango.

According to the Codex Mendoza, the region was conquered under the reign of Tizoc and incorporated into the Aztec Empire.

===Colonial period===
During the early years of the Spanish conquest in Sinaloa, the region currently occupied by the municipality of Mazatlán remained uninhabited. The nearest town was Chametla, which was occupied by the Spanish in 1531, and lent its name to the province, despite being abandoned shortly afterward.

The city was colonized in 1531 by an army of Spaniards.

In 1534, the Valley of Mazatlán was divided into 25 Castellanos by an unknown person who did not stay there for long. In 1576, Don Hernando de Bazán, Governor and Captain General of Nueva Vizcaya, sent Captain Martín Hernández with his father, brothers, and soldiers to occupy the site of Mazatlán, granting them land and titles in return. The Captain&#x27;s claims were ratified in the City of Durango in 1639, and endorsed in the same city in 1650.

Nuño de Guzmán&#x27;s entry to Sinaloa in 1531, and the appointment of the conquered lands as provinces, prompted the internal territorial division of the State. Chametla was occupied by the Spanish, and listed the province extending from the Rio Cañas Elota to the boundary with the province of Culiacán. Both provinces belonged to the kingdom of New Galicia.

In 1565, the town of Chametla was gradually diminished by ongoing Indian raids. That year, Captain Francisco de Ibarra recovered the territory south of the state, rebuilt Chametla, and founded the Villa de San Sebastián (known today as Concordia), and awarded the region to New Vizcaya. The provinces under his jurisdiction included the villages of San Sebastián, Charcas, Copala and Pánuco.

During the last years of the seventeenth century and early eighteenth century, the territory within Sinaloa remained unchanged, until 1732, when the provinces of Sonora and Ostimuri were united, as were the provinces of Sinaloa, Culiacán, and Rosario, with San Felipe and Santiago being the principal cities.

In 1749, Sinaloa was divided into five provinces with their mayors and lieutenancy: Maloya, with jurisdiction over Chametla, Rosario, and San José; Copala, with jurisdiction over San Ignacio, Piaxtla, and Mazatlán; Culiacán, with jurisdiction over Badiraguato, and Sinaloa, which bordered the Mayo River.

In 1786, the intendant system was implemented due to the need to establish a provincial government. Arizpe Municipality was formed out of the territories of Sonora and Sinaloa. That year, the first mayor, Garrido Durán, established eleven subdelegations, eight of them in Sinaloa, with Mazatlán being within the subdelegation of Copala, which was later called San Sebastián.

===Independent Mexico===
Among the first decrees that the legislature enacted was that the addition of each of the eleven districts, and this union, corresponding to the Union Villa Mariano Balleza, be given the name of one of the leading insurgents, parish priest Dolores Hidalgo, on the night of September 15, 1810.

In 1813, the Cadiz constitution came into effect. Article 310 of that constitution provided for the installation of local councils in towns that had more than 1,000 inhabitants. In 1814, Fernando VII repealed that constitution but it was later reinstated in 1820, and the first municipalities in Sinaloa were founded.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, Mazatlán was a native fishing village located north of Cerro de la Aduana. In 1821, it was declared the first port of Mazatlán on Mexico&#x27;s Pacific coast.

Jurisdictionally, Mazatlán remained dependent on the sub-delegation of San Sebastian, unaffected by the divisions between the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. In 1824, they got together to form the Western State. After the imposition of new internal divisions of five departments and municipalities divided into parties, Mazatlán was in the department of San Sebastian, which was formed with the parties of its name, San Ignacio and the Rosary, and it extended to the River of Reeds.

In 1830, the Western State was divided into two states. The first constitution of the state of Sinaloa, promulgated on December 12, 1831, divided the territory into eleven districts with their respective parties, leaving the district town of La Union separated from Concord and San Ignacio.
Until the early 19th century, Mazatlán was a collection of huts inhabited by indigenous people whose major occupation was fishing, according to Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, a French explorer. In 1829, a Filipino banker named Juan Nepomuceno Machado arrived and established commercial relations with vessels coming to Mazatlán from far off places such as Chile, Peru, the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific. By 1836, the city had a population of between 4,000 and 5,000. It subsequently became the largest port on the Mexican Pacific coast.

In 1846 during the Mexican-American War, Mazatlán was invaded and occupied by the U.S. military as part of the U.S. Pacific Coast campaign. In 1859, the port was blockaded by Captain Sidney Grenfell of the British steamship H.M.S. Amethyst. On November 13, 1864, the French Army and the Imperialist forces took possession of Mazatlán, until they were deported on November 13, 1866, by General Ramón Corona&#x27;s forces. After customs officials seized twenty-three ounces of gold from the British warship &quot;Chanticleer&quot; on June 18, 1868, which at the time was blockading the port, its captain, William H. Bridge, threatened to bomb the city on November 22.

During the California Gold Rush, fortune hunters from the United States&#x27; East Coast sailed from New York Harbor and other Atlantic ports to Mexican ports in the Gulf of Mexico. After landing, the aspiring miners travelled over land for weeks to Mazatlán, where they would embark from the port to arrive in San Francisco in another four to five weeks.

When Félix Zuloaga Tacubaya proclaimed the Plan of Ignoring the Constitution of 1857, the garrison of the Plaza de Mazatlán did not remain outside this proclamation, and on January 1, 1858, the Plan of Mazatlán was proclaimed, which followed Zuloaga&#x27;s Plan.

The capital of Sinaloa, until the year 1853, had been Culiacán. However, that year, the capital was transferred to Mazatlán. On July 22, 1867, the federal government passed a law that forbade state capitals from also acting as ports. As a result of this law, on September 20, 1873, the State Legislature decreed that Culiacán would be the state capital again.

The Siglo XIX constitution of 1852 decreed a new internal division in Sinaloa, which reduced it to nine districts by removing San Ignacio, which had been annexed to the Cosalá, and Choix, which had been annexed to El Fuerte. It also amended the name of the district from Villa de la Unión to the port of Mazatlán. That same constitution also decreed the headquarters and council facility policies in each district.

In 1861, the political headquarters were removed and turned into prefectures, and the same year the State Legislature adopted the Act on Municipalities. In 1868, the district had five municipalities in Mazatlán; one in the center and the other four in Villa Unión, Siqueiros, La Noria, and The Milkweed.

On the morning of November 13, 1864, French Navy ships fired twelve cannon shots into the city, causing minor damage to several homes, but not causing any deaths. The attack stopped when the prefect of the city made known to the invaders that the Mexican Army had left the square and the city was formally ceded to the French.

&quot;The Mazatlán Times&quot; was a weekly published by the American A. D. Jones. The first issue appeared on May 12, 1863. The publisher boasted that his was the only weekly English-language newspaper, not only in Mazatlán and Sinaloa, but throughout Mexico.

In 1873, according to the census of the State, the District of Mazatlán was reduced to three municipalities: Mazatlán, Villa Unión, and La Noria. Siqueiros had been annexed in 1870 to the central municipality, and The Milkweed to La Noria.

===Porfiriato===
Mazatlán&#x27;s lighthouse (El Faro) began operating in mid-1879. The maritime signals were manufactured in Paris, France, containing a large oil lamp with mirrors, and a Fresnel lens to focus the light. Since the light was static, from a distance it was often mistaken for a star. By 1905, this lamp was converted to a revolving lamp. During that period, the Mazatlán lighthouse was considered to be the naturally highest in the world. Today, the 1000 watt bulb can be seen for . Near the lighthouse shore, famous &quot;divers&quot; (called this even by the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Mazatlán) perform daring jumps off high rocks into the Pacific Ocean, for tips from onlooking tourists.

On June 26, 1880, Jesus Ramirez, former general in command of 400 men, stormed the garrison of the square and appropriated Mazatlán. The city was subsequently bombed again by the Mexican warship the &quot;Democratic&quot;, which, during its attack, killed and wounded a high number of women and children. Of the 24 cannon shots fired, only three hit the army headquarters, and the rest landed on neighboring houses.

Angela Peralta (1845–1883), a Mexican opera diva famed throughout the world, died of yellow fever in Mazatlán shortly after her arrival in the port. Legend has it that she sang one last aria from her hotel balcony overlooking the Plazuela Machado. Her memory is held dear by Mazatlecos to this day, and the restored Angela Peralta Theater by the Plazuela keeps her memory alive.

The Cerveceria del Pacífico was founded in the city in 1900 by German immigrants.

===Mexican Revolution===

In 1912, the municipalities enacted law No.21 as a form of internal division of the State. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1915 that the law was abolished by the political directorate, when it erected the first free communes.

With the publication of the decree creating the municipality of Mazatlán in the official newspaper on April 8, 1915, independent life began in the region. The Constitution of 1917, culminating in the first constitutional governor, General Ramón F. Iturbe, born in Mazatlán, confirmed the sixteen municipalities into which the state was divided, which would then be subdivided into receiverships and police precincts.

The City of Mazatlán has the dubious distinction of being the second city in the world after Tripoli, Libya, to suffer aerial bombardment (although the local historical display at the &quot;plazuela&quot; claims that Mazatlán was the first). During the Mexican Revolution, General Venustiano Carranza (later president), intent on taking the city of Mazatlán, ordered a biplane to drop a crude bomb of nails and dynamite wrapped in leather on the target of Neveria Hill adjacent to the downtown area of Mazatlán. The crude bomb landed off target on the city streets of Mazatlán, killing two citizens and wounding several others.

===Modern===

Mazatlán is also the hometown of Pedro Infante, one of the most popular actors and singers of the Cinema of Mexico&#x27;s golden years.

Mazatlán was well regarded by film stars such as John Wayne, Gary Cooper, John Huston, and others of their generation as a sportfishing mecca. The hotels along Olas Altas flourished during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, supporting this vibrant trade.

In the 1970s, tourism in Old Mazatlán declined as newer venues catering to Western tourists opened on the expanses of beach to the north of the city (&quot;Zona Dorada&quot;). As an example of Mazatlán&#x27;s tourism expansion, one of the largest timeshare providers in Mexico, Grupo Vidanta, was founded in 1975 with the inauguration of &quot;Paraíso Mazatlán&quot; (Mazatlán Paradise). This time also saw the expansion of the Hotel Playa Mazatlán, and the construction of many others, a trend that continues to this day.

Next to Infante, Lorena Herrera, one of the most famous actresses and singers in Mexico and Latin America during the final decades of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st century, is Mazatlán&#x27;s most famous native. German-born telenovela star Sabine Moussier, a stablemate of Herrera&#x27;s—both have been under Televisa contract since the 1990s—also grew up in Mazatlán. Hollywood and Broadway actress Sara Ramirez is also a Mazatlán native.
As the 21st century began, the Centro Histórico was rediscovered by newcomers and locals alike, spurring a renaissance of restoration and entrepreneurial endeavors. Once-fine homes that had fallen into literal ruin were restored to their former glory as family homes and boutique businesses. The city has assisted by upgrading infrastructure such as better water, sewer, and electrical services.

Mazatlán experienced two total solar eclipses in relatively rapid succession on July 11, 1991 and April 8, 2024, and it was the first city in North America to experience the latter eclipse.

==Neighboring communities==
The town of Mazatlán is organized territorially into nine syndicates:

Mazatlán: Municipal capital, largest and most important tourist destination.

Villa Union: Located 25 km from Mazatlán, second most important town of the municipality. It is said that the first settlers belonged to a Spanish family who arrived there in 1576. Among its economic activities are fishing, agriculture, livestock, fruit growing, aquaculture, and brick making.

El Recodo: So-called for the square shape of the Rio Presidio at this point. It is the cradle of Don Cruz Lizarraga, founder of the international Banda El Recodo. Its economic activities are livestock, agriculture, fruit growing, tanning, and saddlery.

El Quelite: A picturesque and attractive tourist town located 38 km northwest of Mazatlán. The El Quelite River passes through it. Its houses contain the Spanish classical influence predominant in the eighteenth century. Charrería is practiced here, as is the Prehispanic game called Ulama. The main economic activities are: livestock, agriculture, farming and fruit growing.

Mármol de Salcido: This town is 32 km from Mazatlán. It was an important cement and line production center. Its current economic activity is the production of chilies, fodder, and tomatoes; its coast has a large number of pristine beaches.

El Roble: Founded in 1867, it is 32 km from Mazatlán. It became the largest sugar mill in the south of the state. Its main economic activities are agriculture and the production of cheese and honey.

Siqueiros: Originally called Penitas, it then adopted the name of San José de Siqueiros, in honor of the patron saint of the town, and the name of its founder. Founded in 1749, it is located 29 km from Mazatlán on the Presidio River. Among its economic activities are agriculture, livestock, and vegetables.

La Noria: Located 35 km northwest of Mazatlán, its first settlers date from the late sixteenth century. Among its economic activities are livestock, agriculture, and saddlery. It is close to Presa Picachos. A few miles away is the famous Vinata de Los Osuna, a major producer of blue agave, belonging to the family of the same name.

El Habal: A village located 10 km north of Mazatlán. Its inhabitants are engaged in animal husbandry, farming, and fruit growing.

==Geography==

The town of Mazatlán is located in the southern Sinaloa. With a land area of (5.3% of the total area of the state), it is Sinaloa&#x27;s ninth largest municipality. It is bordered on the north by the municipality of San Ignacio and the state of Durango, on the south by the town of El Rosario and the Pacific Ocean, on the east by the town of Concordia, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.

Its average elevation is above sea level.

===Geomorphology===
The orography is determined by the ramifications of the Sierra Madre Occidental on the northwestern coastal plain bearing towards the Pacific Ocean, where the hills rise towards Vigia, Punta de Materén, and the Monte chair. This orography, before entering the municipality of San Ignacio, takes the name of Sierra del Metate, whose characteristic is the formation of Peak Metate.

At the edge of Mazatlán and Concordia runs the Sierra del Metate and Panuco. In this county, the Sierra Madre Occidental is diverted to penetrate Durango, leaving before some detachments, such as the Sierra de San Juan and the Friars, and constitutes, in of its topography, the following hilly areas:

To the north end of town one can see the Friars extending northwest, with elevations ranging from 150 to 1,900 meters above sea level. In the northwestern portion, El Quelite branches have elevations of 50–700 meters above sea level. On the south-east and north sides, Arroyo de La Noria and some tributaries of the River El Quelite rise. The town of La Noria is located in this same part of the mountain, extending in a northwesterly direction at 300 and 500 meters above sea level. On its western side, the Zapote Brook begins. The Sierra de San Marcos is located in the north at 50 to 700 meters above sea level. Forming the southeastern and northwestern slopes are Brook Copala and some tributaries of the Presidio River.

===Geology===

The geological nature of the municipality, primarily made of sedimentary rock, gives rise to the outcrop of fragments of marine and consolidated rocks, and volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Mazatlán generally consists of tonalite and monsonitas belonging to the Middle Tertiary: rhyodacites, rhyolites and ignimbrites with tuffaceous sediments at the base outcrops; andesitic rocks and felsitic late Early Cretaceous conglomerate, sandstone, tuff, sandy tuff &quot;tobalítica&quot;, conglomeratic sandstone, arkose storm origins and late Tertiary rhyolitic tuffs, limestones, shales, sandstones and quartzites of coal, gravel and conglomerates that make alluvial fans and slope deposits; rhyolite and rhyodacite tuffs of the same composition, dacite and Lower Tertiary andecita medium; volcanic and pyroclastic spills of andecitic Cretaceous composition; plutonic rocks of basic composition and basic ultra late Paleozoic, Cretaceous limestones, conglomerates of igneous and metamorphic songs; sediments within the course of rivers and streams and sandy sediments, gravel, silt, and orange.

===Hydrology===
El Quelite River, and the Zapote, La Noria, and Los Cocos streams form part of the water resources of the municipality in the southwestern and southeastern slopes; these streams increase its volume considerably during the rainy season.

The current of the El Quelite River recorded a catchment of 835 square kilometers, where it drained annually for an average of 107 million cubic meters with variations ranging from 78 to 163 million cubic meters. This hydrological current passing through the town of Mazatlán touches the towns of El Castillo, Las Juntas, Amapa, Los Naranjos, Milkweed, Modesto Station, and El Recreo. After traveling a distance of 100 kilometers from its source, it discharges into the Pacific Ocean. The El Zapote and Los Cocos streams drain in a southeasterly direction to end at the Presidio River, up to the villages from which they take their names.

On the southeast slope of the Sierra del Quelite is the De La Noria stream, and on the north side of it are some tributaries from the El Quelite River. The La Noria stream drains in a southeasterly direction of the town of the same name, and finally ends in the Presidio River.

El Zapote stream is formed on the western slope of the Sierra de La Noria, and moves in a southwesterly direction. In passing, it touches the towns of Zapote and El Recreo, and empties into the Pacific Ocean.

On the northern slopes of the Sierra del Salto, near the village of the same name in the state of Durango, the Presidio River moves southeastward and makes a journey of 167 kilometers. Its catchment area is 5,614 square kilometers, with an average annual expenditure of 900 million cubic meters, a maximum of 2,225 and a minimum of 550 million cubic meters. Populations on its banks are Los Cocos, El Zapote, El Placer, El Tecomate, Copala, El Recodo, Porras, Villa Unión, Alley Ostial, and Alley Rosa.

===Coast===

The coasts of the municipality extend over , and sandy beach sediments are formed in the northwestern flank of the head of the municipality. There is a substance classified as berms, which is a soft sediment formation. The coast consists of gravel and conglomerates that form alluvial fans and slope deposits.

In the southwestern corner, Huizache Lagoon occupies an area of 4,000 hectares (40.0 square miles). It receives the maritime influence through the Ostial estuary and freshwater diversion channel, and receives water from the Presidio River.

The coastline of the municipality is lined with shrimp and small-scale flake fishing vessels.

Cooperatives are distributed in the estuaries of the Escopama, Salinitas, El Veintinueve, and Estero Uriah Huizache lagoon.

Most of the islands of the municipality are formed by ignimbrites, rhyolitic tuffs and tuffaceous sandstones of altered and deformed light color.

Bird Island is located between the extreme equatorial coordinates of 106 ° 28&#x27;34 &quot; west longitude and 23 ° 15&#x27;25&quot; north latitude; its area is about 0.4 square kilometers, 1.1 kilometers long, and maximum and minimum range of 800–650 meters respectively.

Deer Island is located between 106 ° 27&#x27;60 &quot; west longitude and 23 ° 14&#x27;03&quot; north latitude; its approximate length is , and its width varies between .

Crestón Island is located on the western edge of the outer bay of Mazatlán, and it has a length of 700 meters and a maximum width of 800 meters. To the northwest, about 3 miles away, small islands like &quot;Southern Brother&quot; and &quot;Northern Brother&quot; (the first with 46.3 meters in elevation) and Turtle Rock rise 1.5 meters above sea level at its highest ridge.

Goats Island is similar to Crestón&#x27;s appearance; it has a height above sea level of a little over 50 meters.

Stone Island is the most important part of the municipal coastline; its size is the largest of all because it has 30 square kilometers, and is approximately 14.5 miles long by 2.5 wide. Despite its name, Stone Island is a peninsula that connects to the continent near the Mazatlán International Airport.

===Climate===
Located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Mazatlán has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;), bordering a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), with a marked and rather long dry season and an average annual temperature of 25 °C.

During the summer months, with the humidity factor, temperatures usually feel well above what the thermometer shows.

During the period of 1940–1980, the municipality experienced an average annual 748 mm of precipitation, with a maximum of 215.4 mm in 24 hours, and 90.4 mm was observed in one hour. During the same period the average evaporation rate per year was 2146.80 mm; the prevailing winds are in a northwesterly direction at an average speed of 5.0 meters. 
===Flora and fauna===

The flora of Mazatlán are tabachines, eucalyptus, laurels, and poplars. Its fauna includes birds like ducks, herons, and pelicans. There are armadillos, raccoons, and a variety of marine species such as whales, dolphins, turtles, and fish. White-tailed deer is one of the main animals that characterizes Mazatlán. Today, there are fewer animals and plants than before, due to the way humans have changed the ecosystem.

Mazatlán has several protected areas, one of which is the Protection of Flora and Fauna Area (APFF). CACAXTLA Plateau is located between the towns of Mazatlán and San Ignacio in the central part of the state of Sinaloa, and contains a portion of the coastal habitats of the state, and is the largest in Sinaloa. This wealth of habitats favors the presence of 66 species of flora and fauna listed in NOM-059-ECOL-2001 and CITES and 47.5% of endemism reported for Sinaloa, plus charismatic and commercially important species. At the same time, the protected area is home to a population of 7,964 inhabitants, whose livelihood depends entirely on the extraction of natural resources in this area. The relationship between nature and society in the APFF Cacaxtla Plateau is the focus of this program.

==Economy==
Tourism and fishing are the main industries in Mazatlán. The city houses the main beach resorts, and has the second largest fishing fleet in Mexico. The most processed seafood products in the city are shrimp and tuna. The first Mazatlán hotel with a restaurant inside was named Canton La Fonda, and became operational in 1850. It was owned by a Chinese immigrant, Luen-Sing, which called the establishment the Luen-Sing Hotel. In 1864, there were three hotels and three restaurants in Mazatlán, with more opening in the late nineteenth century. Today, more than twenty miles of beaches are the main attraction, and the city contains a large number of hotels, restaurants, bars, and shops. The city is also home to the Pacífico brewery, a coffee factory, and two power plants.
==Main beaches==
* Olas Altas: the beach with greatest historical reference to Mazatlán, it is located in the southern part of the city, a few meters from downtown. It has a length of 550 meters, in the section of the boardwalk that passes through Olas Altas one can see various monuments such as The Shield, which contains the shields of Sinaloa and Mazatlán; The Deer, a statue of a deer representing the etymology of the city&#x27;s name; Monument to Pedro Infante; Monument to the Continuity of Life; Monument to Mazatleca Women, and also the restaurant &quot;Puerto Viejo&quot;.
* Norte Beach: It is located along the northwest edge of the commercial downtown district. Here one can find the Monument to Fishermen; the Monument to Pulmonias, and the Monument to the hometown Pacific Brewery. The second of these refers to the characteristic taxis of this city.
* Sábalo Beach: the long stretch of beach along Camaron Sabalo and Malecon from the Fishermen&#x27;s Monument to the marina jetty.
* Cerritos Beach: It starts at the entrance to the &quot;new&quot; marina and the end of the Golden Zone (hotel district) and runs north to Cerritos point, a rocky landform just before the Emerald Bay resort.
* Isla de la Piedra Beach: A miles-long Located in the southern part of the city on the peninsula that is separated from the old city by the entrance to the main commercial harbor; only accessible by car on a recently paved road from just off the airport access road, or, by small passenger ferries that provide regular service from the docks at the edge of the historic center.

==Tourism and culture==

===Historic Center===
The Historic Center of Mazatlán, among whose former inhabitants are French, German, Chinese, Italian, Spanish and Americans (many contemporary inhabitants of Mazatlán are descended from these), was named Heritage of the Nation on 12 March 2001. A civil association composed of a group of Mazatlán locals have managed to revive this area, along with the support of various organizations, companies, and government authorities. Among the buildings and areas of high cultural value are the Cathedral, Plazuela República, Plazuela Zaragoza, Plazuela Machado, Plazuela Hidalgo, the Angela Peralta Theater, the old Hotel Iturbide (today the Municipal Arts Centre), Mansion of Redo, Melchers House, House of Retes, Corvera Building, Bank of London and Mexico Building, Haas House, Temple of San José, and various others.

===Culture and art===
Mazatlán hosts several events annually, the most important being the International Carnival of Mazatlán, which was 114 years old in 2012. Other important events are the Mazatlán Cultural Festival and the José Limón International Dance Festival, celebrated every year in the winter and spring, respectively. There is also the Book Fair and Arts of Mazatlán (Feliart) and Mazatlán Book Fair (FELIMAZ).

Another important event is the International Motorcycle Week, which attracts thousands of motorcyclists from around the country as well as from abroad, and is held each year during Easter week.

In sports, Mazatlán is home to the Pacific International Triathlon held in April, and the Pacific International Marathon, which is held every year in late November and early December, and is attended by athletes from around the world.

In 2012, Mazatlán was chosen as the host city for the tenth installment of Premios Oye!, prizes awarded by the National Academy of Music in Mexico, and the Volleyball Olympic qualifiers for the Olympic Games in London 2012.

===Mazatlán Carnival===
This is currently one of the most important carnivals in Mexico, since the first parade on Sunday brings together more than 600,000 people for over three hours in the coastal area of the city on the &quot;Avenida del Mar.&quot; A novelty that allows tourists to come from all over the world to witness this festival is called &quot;Burning of humor&quot; where tradition says to burn a character (Monigote) representing someone who people think has done a misdeed, which usually means politicians, presidents, or as in 2013, &quot;influenza&quot; was burned. Both of these have negatively affected the country&#x27;s image in recent years. This is followed by the famous &quot;Naval Combat,&quot; depicting the battle that took place against French vessels seeking to land at the port.

A very representative element of this carnival are the great &quot;Monigotes&quot; that are placed in important areas of the city as decorations. These are giant figures made of paper mache are supported by large structures. The central events of the carnival are the crowning of the queen of the carnival, and this is a massive event held with a selection of world-class artists. Two parades are scheduled, one on Sunday and another on Mardi Gras (to close the celebration). Superbly decorated and colorful floats line a good part of the coastal walk, with an estimated several hundred thousand spectators in attendance. These include royal courts, ambassadors from around the country and abroad, special guests such as athletes, TV entertainers, and various showbusiness personalities, not to mention hundreds of Mazatlecos of all ages and social conditions.

The Mazatlán Carnival is distinguished from other carnivals for its distinctive accompaniment by Banda Sinaloa music that has transcended the world through what is today called &quot;la onda grupera.&quot; Events includes cultural activities (poetry contests, literature prizes, and shows of enormous artistic quality), with which the party extends to all sectors of the population and covers a range of local and tourist tastes.

===Mazatlán Lighthouse===

The Mazatlán lighthouse, called El Faro Lighthouse, is located at the peak of Cerro del Crestón, at the southern end of the peninsular city of Mazatlán. The lighthouse has the distinction of being settled in what was formerly an island, and has a length of 641 meters by 321 meters and a height of 157 meters, making it the highest natural lighthouse in the Americas, and one of the highest operating lighthouses in the world.

In 1821, the Cortes of Cádiz issued a decree certifying the City of Mazatlán as the first port of height of the Mexican Pacific. This introduced Mazatlán as a viable destination for international trade. The decree, along with the rapid growth of large mining and commercial consortia, led to an intensified level of ship traffic. In those days, it was not uncommon for over 60 ships from Europe and the Far East, loaded with different types of merchandise, to reach the port each year. After several days of travel and trading of supplies, these boats would depart Mazatlán loaded with bars of gold and silver from the rich mines of the region.

While the exponential amount of growth in boat traffic into and out of the port undoubtedly benefited the region, it also presented a problem at night. At that time there was no way to indicate to boats in the dark where the marina was located, or how to enter and dock, making it hard for ships to be accurate, which often led to sailors endangering their boats.

The first use of the Isla de Crestón as a lighted marine signal was in 1828. The light facilities, located on top of an imposing hill, were very modest, consisting of only a small stone structure on which fires, fueled by whale oil and wood, or coconut chips, were lit. The fires were fed wood and coal, allowing them to produce a dim light that could only be seen within walking distance, making it of little help to seafarers, especially in bad weather.

El Faro became the answer to the problem. First lit over the Pacific Ocean in 1879, the lighthouse&#x27;s original lamp was constructed in Paris. It was made of an oil lamp surrounded by mirrors, and a Fresnel lens to focus the light. This allowed El Faro&#x27;s light to be seen from a much further distance, and thus give better navigation services, leading to approaches made with greater precision.

In 1905, the lamp was converted to hydrogen gas, and was made to be able to revolve in a full circle. The final update of the light source came in 1933, when it was converted to electricity, which is what is still there today. In order to emit its powerful light, El Faro uses a 1,000 watt bulb, which is focused by a Fresnel lens.

It is now one of the top tourist attractions in the city of Mazatlán, and people can hike up to see it up close. The view from the lighthouse is also a big draw for visitors.

===Banda Sinaloense===
Banda Sinaloense or Tambora is a type of musical ensemble, as well as a traditional and popular musical genre, which was established in the early twenties in the state of Sinaloa, in the northwestern region of Mexico. It originates in the European Fanfare style, however, like many other traditional Mexican ensembles, Banda Sinaloense groups perform a variety of musical forms, and their repertoire covers various traditional styles such as rancheras, corridos, polkas, waltzes, mazurkas, and chotis, all tailored to the sensitivity of the inhabitants of this Mexican region: music as well as romantic ballads such as Cumbia.

The unique sound of the Sinaloa band is very similar to German and French wind instrument bands, though there are differences in styles between north-central and southern parts of the state. In the north-central area, the musical phrasing is lighter and nuanced, more similar to Western European styles, and in the south, the style has a very strong phrasing and a little less nuanced performance, more influenced by the Bavarian German style. Several researchers, have located the origin of these styles to these regions, especially considering foreign interventions in the state and in Mazatlán early in the century, which was inhabited mostly by German immigrants. However, the Swiss ethnomusicologist Helena Simonett explains that the first Sinaloense bands were formed by people who deserted the military and municipal bands, and went to live in mountain villages, adding credence to the Sinaloa founders with the rhythmic influence of Mayo-Yoreme, which have contributed to its essence. Nevertheless, there is an historic agreement which dates the musical influence before the Mazatlán German trade boom (1870–1890), as it would lead not only to distribution of instruments through marketing, but also required a cultural disclosure that could only happen in a close relationship between the carriers of such traditions and the people of the region, and this circumstance only occurred in Mazatlán. That is why the theory of French and Spanish influence on the German influence in other regions of Sinaloa is reinforced as the development of the music of the Sinaloan drum has records and previous history in distant places in the mountains of Sinaloa where there was no German influence. However, post-war French influence intervention and Spanish cultural remnants are present. There is also evidence of the formation of the first organological Mazatlán clusters as well as other parts of Sinaloa, for example: La Banda El Recodo de Don Cruz Lizarraga in 1938, which had a strong German influence in its playing style, and included stringed instruments, in contrast with La Banda Los Tacuichamona (1888), La Banda Los Sirolas Culiacán (1920) and The Band of Brothers Rubio (1929) Mocorito, which were exclusively wind instruments and percussion akin to the Galo-Ibérico fanfare style.

===Sports===
Baseball is popular among Mazatlecos. The representative team, called Venados de Mazatlán, is part of the Mexican Pacific League. The league&#x27;s season begins in mid-October and ends in late December. Playoffs are in January of every year, and from the eight teams that make up the league, one becomes the representative of Mexico in the Caribbean Series.

In Basketball the representative team, called Venados de Mazatlán, is part of the CIBACOPA. The league season is played from the last days of March until the first days of June, while the playoffs begin in mid-June and end the first days of July.

Another sport that has been practiced for over 25 years is soccer, with major achievements both statewide and nationally. On June 2, 2020, it was announced that Liga MX club Monarcas Morelia would be relocating to a new state of the art football stadium in Mazatlán in time for the league&#x27;s 2020–21 season, with rumors that the team would be renamed either Delfines de Mazatlán (Dolphins of Mazatlán) or Mazatlán F.C.

Mazatlán is a major sporting center of the country, with important sporting activities such as the marathon and triathlon, in which not only local but also foreign athletes participate.

One of the initial cricket teams in Mazatlán were the Mazatlán Redskins. They now play American football, soccer, and volleyball.

=== La Isla de la Piedra ===
La Isla de la Piedra, called Stone Island was born in 1936. Stone Island is known throughout Mexico for its long sandy beaches, Mexico&#x27;s third largest coconut grove followed by the length of the southern beach which seems to disappears in the horizon. The main source of work for the residents of the island is fishing and transportation, as they bring many tourist and locals to the island from Mazatlán due to its popularity. To get to the island, it is possible to go by ferry, water taxi or drive by the 15 Mexico-Nogales road. Activities on the island include boat excursions, swimming, beach activities, and horseback riding.

=== Mazatlán Aquarium ===
Since its opening on September 13, 1980, Mazatlán Aquarium has been one of the most complete of its kind in Latin America.

It was divided into two main areas, the aquarium and the botanical garden. The aquarium contained exhibits for 50 different fish species and a museum that had temporary exhibitions and permanent displays that included shells, snails, and materials relating to the marine ecosystem. The botanical garden consisted of 1 hectare which included 75 tree species from around the world, and regional species of Sinaloa.

On May 30, 2023, the Gran Acuario Mazatlán was inaugurated, replacing and expanding the old aquarium that was in its place, it was the largest aquarium in Latin America.

===Gastronomy===

Main dishes in Mazatlán are heavily influenced by seafood. Food specialties include ceviches, cocktails, zarandeado fish, and aguachile. Other common and prominent foods are smoked marlin and tuna, chilorio, bearded tamales (made with shrimp), Governor tacos, fish crackers and Sinaloa-style grill-roasted chicken. 

There is also a variety of restaurants offering international cuisine such as Japanese, Italian and Chinese. Fast food, vegetarian, snacks, meats, and a variety of taquerias with their own specialty foods are also available.

The local cuisine offers a variety of fresh drinks such as horchata, barley, coconut, coconut horchata, Tejuino, wines and a range of beers, of which the best known is the local beer called Pacífico, which has its factory in the harbor. Another well-known drink in the region is a vanilla-flavored beverage called &quot;tonicol.&quot;

Typical sweets include coconut candies, jamoncillos, and other candy made with coconut marshmallows from the region.

===The Malecón of Mazatlán===
The Malecón (boardwalk) of Mazatlán is to be considered one of the longest in the world. Its length is about along the Pacific coast. Along the Malecón are high cliffs, monuments, roundabouts, historical buildings, hotels, etc. 
The Malecón is composed of a series of roadways with designated space for pedestrians. The names of these roads vary depending on the stage or time of their construction. From south to north, the roads that compose the Malecón are as follow:
* Calz. Joel Montes Camarena: which connects the lighthouse, which used to be an island, to the rest of the city.
* Paseo del Centenario: starting in the previous street and bordering the west at the lookout hill where cliffs are seen, it was built to commemorate the centennial of the Independence of Mexico.
* Paseo Olas Altas: the oldest section of the boardwalk, it was originally a dike to prevent flooding problems in the 1830s, then it became an embankment which was used as urban space, and eventually it became a recreational space. It was the first part of the city with street lighting, and includes the south side of icebox hill and lookout hill.
* Paseo Claussen: It was built for the centennial in 1910. It borders the icebox hill and ends at the bay of Puerto Viejo. It was named in honor of George Claussen, who was in command of the Mazatlán Works Agency and promoted the centennial project.
* Avenida del Mar: This is the most representative and longest section of the boardwalk; it extends along the bay of Puerto Viejo and comprises just over half of all the boardwalk. The panoramic tour ends at the tip, which initiates the Golden Zone (the primary hotel zone), and the avenue changes names twice and continues for several kilometers parallel to the coastline, yet maintains some distance from the coastal hotels.

==Politics==

In the municipality of Mazatlán, two electoral preferences exist. While the inhabitants of the receiverships, police stations, and other villages in the municipality continue voting traditionally for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), this phenomenon is changing within the city.

Mazatlán has traditionally been governed by municipal leaders from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. During the municipal elections of 1989, Humberto Rice García (1990–1992) won the municipal presidency as a candidate for the National Action Party (PAN). However, the Institutional Revolutionary Party regained the municipality during the elections of 1992, when Martin Gavica Garduño (1993–1995) won the leadership. Alejandro Camacho Mendoza reclaimed the municipality for his party, PAN, for the 1996-1998 period, and Alejandro Higuera Osuna held it for the 1999–2001 term.

In the 2002-2004 elections, both the National Action Party and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) were defeated by the Labour Party candidate, Jorge Alberto Rodriguez Pasos. However, a few months after taking the oath of mayor, Rodriguez Pasos was deposed by the State Congress after being charged for domestic violence, in which his own wife accused him. His place was taken by Gerardo Ramirez Rosete, from the same party. Shortly thereafter, in a move seen as a ruse of the PRI state government, he was replaced by Ricardo Ramírez González, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

In the 2005-2007 elections, Alejandro Higuera Osuna from PAN won the municipal presidency and held it until June 2007, when he resigned to contest the election for local deputy; on the 12th of that month, he was replaced by Isaac Lopez Arregui.

In the 2008-2010 elections, the Institutional Revolutionary Party regained the town with its candidate Jorge Abel Lopez Sanchez.

Since April 2010, the town of Mazatlán has been ruled by both the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action Party, since the last mayoral election was won by PRI member Jorge Abel Lopez Sanchez, who defeated a former PAN and Petetista government (PT). That was the last time that Mazatlán has had a PRI government.

In July 2010, in the election for Governor, Local, and Municipal Presidents&#x27; Deputies, the first loss occurred for the PRI governor of Sinaloa. Mario López Valdez, former Sinaloa Senator and member of the PRI, was defeated. This ended the PRI hegemony in the state of Sinaloa. Another important event was the third choice Alejandro Higuera Osuna from PAN, who won the municipal presidency of Mazatlán. In addition, the PAN won a historic vote statewide.

==Educational institutions==
French explorer Duflot de Mofras notes that by the 1840s, foreign traders based in Mazatlán impelled the opening of the first public school in the city. Still, in 1872, there were only two primary schools. In 1873, the Liceo Rosales, which over time would become the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, was founded.

Mazatlán has several preschools, elementary, middle, high schools, and universities of both public and private institutions. The Autonomous University of Sinaloa is the largest public university in the city. Other public universities or institutions for higher education include the University of the West and the Polytechnic University of Sinaloa. The remaining universities and institutions of higher education in Mazatlán belong to the private sector and they are the following: Mazatlán Institute of Technology, Nautical School of Mazatlán, TecMilenio University, Autonomous University of Durango, and the Sinaloa Superior Institute of Technology.

The National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM, has a presence in the city with an academic unit specializing in marine sciences and the Center for Food Research and Development.

<text>Cherry Creek is a tributary of the Cheyenne River, approximately 50 mi (80 km), in central South Dakota in the United States.

Cherry Creek was so named on account of the cherry trees along its course.

It rises in the prairie country of northern Meade County, and flows southeast and east, across the southwest corner of the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation, and past Red Scaffold. It joins the Cheyenne at the town of Cherry Creek.

<doc id="540690" wikidata="Q336282" url="?curid=540690" title="Rick Moranis">
<text>Frederick Allan Moranis (; born April 18, 1953) is a Canadian actor, comedian, musician, producer, songwriter and writer.

Moranis appeared in the sketch comedy series &quot;Second City Television&quot; (&quot;SCTV&quot;) in the 1980s and starred afterward in several Hollywood films, including &quot;Strange Brew&quot; (1983), &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) and its sequel &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989),&quot; Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987), &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989, and its 1992 and 1997 sequels), &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989), &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994).

In 1997, Moranis began a long break from acting to dedicate his time to his two children as a widower. He has not appeared in a live-action film for over 25 years, although he provided voice-over work for a few animated films, including Disney&#x27;s &quot;Brother Bear&quot; (2003). He also released comedy albums and made appearances at fan conventions.

In 2020, after a hiatus of nearly 23 years from live-action films, Moranis signed to reprise his role of Wayne Szalinski in a new sequel to &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;, called &quot;Shrunk&quot; before the project was put on hold.

==Early life==
Moranis was born on April 18, 1953, in Toronto, Ontario, to a Jewish family. He attended elementary school with Geddy Lee, frontman of the rock band Rush.

==Career==
His career as an entertainer began as a radio disc jockey in the mid-1970s, using the on-air name &quot;Rick Allan&quot; at Toronto radio stations CFTR, CKFH, 1050 CHUM and CHUM-FM.

In the mid-1970s, Moranis and comedy partner Rob Cowan, also a budding young radio announcer, performed on CBC-TV. Their spoof of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; was popular, and they periodically performed it on the road, including a charity sports dinner in Sarnia, Ontario.

In 1977, he teamed up with Winnipeg-born writer/director and performer Ken Finkleman on a series of live performances on CBC&#x27;s &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot;; comedy radio specials; and television comedy pilots, including one called &quot;Midweek&quot; and another called &quot;1980&quot; (produced at CBC Toronto in 1979). Both pilots starred Finkleman and Moranis in a series of irreverent sketches, including an early mockumentary sketch featuring Moranis as a Canadian movie producer, and another featuring the dubbed-in voiceovers of Nazi war criminals as they appear to be discussing their Hollywood agents and the money one can earn being interviewed on major documentary series like &quot;The World at War&quot;.

In 1980, Moranis was persuaded to join the third-season cast of &quot;Second City Television&quot; (SCTV) by friend and &quot;SCTV&quot; writer/performer Dave Thomas. At the time, Moranis was the only cast member not to have come from a Second City stage troupe. He became especially noted for his impressions of celebrities ranging from pop culture icons like Woody Allen, Merv Griffin, and David Brinkley to somewhat lower-level stars such as comedian George Carlin and musician Michael McDonald, and even to the marginally notable Teri Shields (mother of Brooke).

With &quot;SCTV&quot; moving to CBC in 1980 (and syndicated in the United States), Moranis and Thomas were challenged to fill two additional minutes with &quot;identifiable Canadian content&quot;, and created a sketch called &quot;The Great White North&quot; featuring the characters Bob and Doug McKenzie, a couple of Canadian buffoons. By the time NBC ordered 90-minute programs for the U.S. in 1981 (the fourth season of &quot;SCTV&quot; overall), there had been such favourable feedback from affiliates on the McKenzies that the network requested the duo have a sketch in every show.

Bob and Doug became a pop-culture phenomenon, which led to a top-selling and Grammy-nominated album, &quot;Great White North&quot;, and the 1983 movie &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, Moranis&#x27;s first major film role. He followed that up with the 1984 movie &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;.

Another notable Moranis character on &quot;SCTV&quot; was Gerry Todd, a disc jockey who presented music clips on television. The sketch aired before the debut of MTV in the United States, leading both Sound &amp; Vision and Martin Short to dub Moranis as the creator of the video jockey. &quot;There had been no such thing&quot; up until that point, recalled Short, so &quot;the joke was that there would be such a thing.&quot;

===Feature films===
After his &quot;SCTV&quot; work, and the &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; movies, Moranis had a busy career in feature films that lasted over a decade, most notably &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) and its sequel, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989); &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985); &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986); &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987); &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989) and its 1992 and 1997 sequels; &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989); &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (1990); and Barney Rubble in &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994). He also did the voice-over for a short-lived cartoon series on NBC called &quot;Gravedale High&quot; (1990).

Moranis was also slated to appear (as the janitor) in the 1985 John Hughes film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. After a week or so of filming, Moranis was released by producer Ned Tanen because he felt Moranis&#x27;s interpretation of the role as an over-the-top Russian caricature was not appropriate for the serious nature of the film. Moranis presented the departure as a mutual decision and hoped to work with Hughes in the future.

Moranis was originally cast as Phil Berquist in the 1991 film &quot;City Slickers&quot;, but later dropped out due to his wife&#x27;s illness.

Moranis&#x27;s last film roles were the box-office flops &quot;Little Giants&quot; (1994) and &quot;Big Bully&quot; (1996). By the mid-1990s, his only appearance in the genre was a 1993 music video, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Girls&quot; by Donald Fagen, in which he played a man married to an extraterrestrial woman. Disney&#x27;s final film in the &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; franchise is 1997&#x27;s direct-to-video film &quot;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&quot;, in which Moranis is the final remaining original cast member. The series &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show&quot; also launched in 1997 but without Moranis; it concluded in 2000. He worked for Disney twice more (with his fellow &quot;SCTV&quot; alumnus Dave Thomas), voicing Rutt the moose in the 2003 animated film &quot;Brother Bear&quot; and its 2006 direct-to-video sequel.

In a 2004 interview, Moranis talked about his favourite kinds of films:

=== Acting hiatus ===
In 1997, Moranis took a hiatus from working in the film industry. He later explained, &quot;I&#x27;m a single parent and I just found that it was too difficult to manage to raise my kids and to do the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn&#x27;t miss it.&quot;

After having declined an invitation to make a cameo appearance in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Moranis clarified in an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that despite his hiatus he had not, in fact, retired from acting in films, but instead had become selective about future roles.

=== Later work ===
In 2001, Moranis received his first film credit since 1997 when he provided voice work in the animated film &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys&quot;.

, Moranis was on the Advisory Committee for the comedy program at Humber College.

In 2005, Moranis released an album titled &quot;The Agoraphobic Cowboy&quot;, featuring country songs with lyrics that Moranis says follow in the comic tradition of songwriters/singers such as Roger Miller, Kinky Friedman, and Jim Stafford. The album was produced by Tony Scherr and is distributed through ArtistShare, as well as Moranis&#x27;s official website. Commenting on the origins of the songs, he said that in 2003, &quot;Out of the blue, I just wrote a bunch of songs. For lack of a better explanation, they&#x27;re more country than anything. And I actually demoed four or five of them, and I&#x27;m not sure at this point what I&#x27;m going to do with them—whether I&#x27;m going to fold them into a full-length video or a movie. But, boy, I had a good time doing that.&quot;

On December 8, 2005, &quot;The Agoraphobic Cowboy&quot; was nominated for the 2006 Grammy for Best Comedy Album. On February 3, 2006, Moranis performed &quot;Press Pound&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and discussed the development of his music career.

In November 2007, Moranis reunited with Dave Thomas for a 24th anniversary special of Bob and Doug McKenzie, titled &quot;Bob and Doug McKenzie&#x27;s 2–4 Anniversary&quot;. The duo shot new footage for this special. Thomas subsequently created a new animated Bob and Doug McKenzie series, &quot;Bob &amp; Doug&quot;, for his company Animax Entertainment. Moranis declined to voice the role of Bob, which was taken over by Dave Coulier, but remained involved in the series as an executive producer.

On June 18, 2013, Moranis released the comedy album titled &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Brisket &amp; Other Love Songs&quot;, his first album in eight years. Moranis said of the release, &quot;When I first began writing jokes and sketches with various Jewish partners one of us would inevitably stop at some point and announce, &#x27;Too Jewish!&#x27; Too Jewish for the star, the show, the network, or the audience. The songs on this album are all in that category. I grew up hearing the Allan Sherman and the &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be Jewish&quot; albums in the &#x27;60s. Now I am in my 60s.&quot;

In a June 2013 interview, Moranis talked about reprising his role as Louis Tully in a third &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film and his disappointment with the sequel. Moranis said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t talked to Dan Aykroyd about it. Somebody he&#x27;s associated with called me and I said, &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t not do it, but it&#x27;s got to be good.&#x27; You know, I&#x27;m not interested in doing anything I&#x27;ve already done, and I thought the second one was a disappointment. But I guess I&#x27;m interested in where that guy is now. I sort of see him as being Bernie Madoff&#x27;s cellmate in jail. Both of them being so orderly that they race to get up and make their beds.&quot; In 2015, regarding an offer for a brief appearance in the 2016 film, he concluded, &quot;&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; didn&#x27;t appeal to me. I wish them well, but it just makes no sense to me.&quot;

In July 2017, Moranis and Dave Thomas reprised their Bob and Doug characters at a benefit concert in Toronto. Proceeds from the benefit went toward caring for Jake Thomas, Dave&#x27;s nephew, who suffered a spinal cord injury that has left him paralyzed from the waist down.

On May 9, 2018, Moranis returned as the character Pannakin Crybaby / Lord Dark Helmet from &quot;Spaceballs&quot; in an episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, albeit as a voice. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Prop Culture&quot; discussing the film.

Moranis appears in the Martin Scorsese–directed &quot;Second City TV&quot; reunion documentary, titled &quot;An Afternoon with SCTV&quot;, set to premiere on Netflix.

In 2020, Moranis signed on to reprise his role as Wayne Szalinski in &quot;Shrunk&quot;, a new sequel in the &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; series. When completed, it will mark a return to live-action films for Moranis after a hiatus of over two decades. Later that same year, he appeared in a commercial for Mint Mobile alongside Ryan Reynolds.

==Personal life==
Moranis married make-up designer Ann Belsky in 1986; together they had two children, a son and a daughter. Belsky died of cancer in February 1991. Moranis then slowly left public life to become a full-time single father.

On October 1, 2020, Moranis was assaulted in New York City, in the vicinity of West 70th Street, Manhattan. He suffered minor injuries to his head, back, and hip. He reported the incident to the New York Police Department, who posted security footage of the attack. On November 14, 2020, the alleged perpetrator was arrested in New York City.

<text>The vampire lifestyle, vampire subculture, or vampire community (sometimes spelled as &quot;vampyre&quot;) is an alternative lifestyle and subculture based around the mythology of and popular culture based on vampires. Those within the subculture commonly identify with or as vampires, with participants typically taking heavy inspiration from media and pop culture based on vampiric folklore and legend, such as the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, the tabletop role-playing game &quot;&quot;, and the book series &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; by author Anne Rice. Practices within the vampire community range from blood-drinking from willing donors to organising groups known as &#x27;houses&#x27; and &#x27;courts&#x27; of self-identified vampires. 

The vampire subculture largely stemmed from the goth subculture, but also incorporates some elements of the sadomasochism subculture. The Internet provides a prevalent forum of communication for the subculture, along with other media such as glossy magazines devoted to the topic.

Participants within the subculture range from those who dress as vampires but understand themselves to be human, to those who assert a need to consume either blood or &#x27;human energy&#x27;. Both types of vampires may assert that the consumption of blood or energy (sometimes referred to as auric or pranic energy) is necessary for spiritual or physical nourishment.

Though the vampire subculture has considerable overlap with gothic subculture, the vampire community also has overlap with both therian and otherkin communities, and are considered by some to be a part of both, despite the difference in cultural and historical development.

==Types of vampire lifestylers==
There are several types of vampire lifestylers:

* &quot;&quot;: (sometimes referred to as hematophages) consume the blood of others
* &quot;Psychic vampires&quot;: claim to attain nourishment from the aura or pranic energy of others in order to balance a spiritual or psychological energy deficiency, such as a damaged aura or chakra
* &quot;Hybrids&quot;: both consume blood and assert that they consume psychic energy
* &quot;Blood donors&quot;: willingly allow other members of the subculture to drink their blood, and may or may not exhibit subservience toward those who do
* &quot;Blood fetishists&quot;: use blood as a stimulant or sexual fetish, sometimes drinking it during the course of sadomasochistic sex
* &quot;Role-players&quot; or &quot;lifestylers&quot;: acknowledge that they are human beings roleplaying as vampires. Williams states that they may &quot;dress up in vampire clothing, live a vampire lifestyle (e.g. sleep in coffins), and primarily participate in RPGs such as &quot;&quot;&quot;

== Explanations for blood-drinking ==
Renfield syndrome is a clinical condition marked by a fixation on blood or blood-drinking.

Sex researchers have also documented cases of people with sexual (paraphilic) vampirism and autovampirism.

== Controversy ==

=== Christianity ===
Some self-proclaimed Christian vampire slayers have arisen in response to the vampire subculture. Online, they swarm vampire websites with hate mail and participate in other similar activities.

<doc id="540704" wikidata="Q1017358" url="?curid=540704" title="Kavieng">
<text>Kavieng is the capital of the Papua New Guinean province of New Ireland and the largest town on the island of the same name. The town is located at Balgai Bay, on the northern tip of the island. As of 2009, it had a population of 17,248.

Kavieng is the main port for New Ireland, and is both a trading and tourist destination. Several dive companies operate from the town, as the area is known for its diving, both for natural sites and wrecks dating from the Second World War. There are plane and shipwrecks in Kavieng Harbor itself, as well as several more nearby.

The town is serviced by Kavieng Airport, with daily connections to Port Moresby. It lies at one end of the Boluminski Highway which runs of sealed road to Namatanai.

Kavieng has all the usual services of a local administrative center: local government offices; shopping; hotels (such as the Kavieng Hotel, the Malagan Beach Resort hotel and the Kavieng Club (the former &quot;colonial club&quot; in the town)); a hospital providing general medical, pediatric and surgical services; and a weekly market. There is also a large wharf for copra export on the town&#x27;s edge, which allow deep-water ships to load copra and oil directly from land.

Visible from Kavieng are the many islands of the archipelago lying between New Ireland and New Hanover, including Nusa Lik, Nusa Lawa, and Nango Island (which was formerly the site of a fish cannery in the 1960s and 1970s). Nango is also the site of a new marine research center for the PNG National Fisheries Authority. Its opening was overseen by the Governor-General of PNG, Mr. Paulius Matane, in July 2009.

== History ==
The area was first charted by Dutch explorers in 1616, but it was not until the early 1900s (decade) that Kavieng town was founded by the German colonial administration. Though some on the island became quite wealthy with the development of copra plantations, Kavieng itself remained a tiny settlement, with as few as eighty residents. After the First World War, Kavieng, as part of Papua New Guinea, was ceded to Australian control. This resulted in the deportation of German missionaries and the seizure of all German property in the town.

On 21 January 1942, during World War II, Kavieng came under a massive aerial bombardment by Japanese forces. That night, the vast majority of Australians were evacuated from New Ireland. The Japanese invaded and occupied the island on 24 January. Over the next two years, almost all of the Europeans who had remained on the island were killed by the Japanese. Rear Admiral Ryukichi Tamura gave the order to kill all the European prisoners in Kavieng if an imminent invasion by Allied forces was expected. At least twenty-three of these were executed in the Kavieng Wharf Massacre in March 1944, which later led to the perpetrators being sentenced for war crimes. By the time the Allies retook the island in 1945, Kavieng had been almost completely destroyed.

As a result of the Japanese occupation and subsequent Allied invasion there are a number of wartime relics in the town, most notably a large gun sitting above a bunker adjacent to the Harbour Road. Although not officially open to the public, the bunker has several openings allowing entry, and the gun position provides an extensive view of the harbor.

Today Kavieng is home to a thriving tourism industry. Dive, trekking, and surf tourism predominate with all of the tourism depending on the rich biological diversity of New Ireland. The surf tourism industry has entered into partnerships with local land and reef owners to develop what they refer to as a &quot;surf management plan.&quot; This plan provides resource owners with income from the surfers and limits the number of surfers on any break at one time.

==Climate==
Kavieng has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with hot days, warm nights, and heavy rainfall year-round.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in group theory, the Frattini subgroup formula_1 of a group is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of . For the case that has no maximal subgroups, for example the trivial group {&quot;e&quot;} or a Prüfer group, it is defined by formula_2. It is analogous to the Jacobson radical in the theory of rings, and intuitively can be thought of as the subgroup of &quot;small elements&quot; (see the &quot;non-generator&quot; characterization below). It is named after Giovanni Frattini, who defined the concept in a paper published in 1885.

==Some facts==
* formula_1 is equal to the set of all non-generators or non-generating elements of . A non-generating element of is an element that can always be removed from a generating set; that is, an element &quot;a&quot; of such that whenever is a generating set of containing &quot;a&quot;, formula_4 is also a generating set of .
* formula_1 is always a characteristic subgroup of ; in particular, it is always a normal subgroup of .
* If is finite, then formula_1 is nilpotent.
* If is a finite &quot;p&quot;-group, then formula_7. Thus the Frattini subgroup is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; such that the quotient group formula_8 is an elementary abelian group, i.e., isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of order &quot;p&quot;. Moreover, if the quotient group formula_9 (also called the &quot;Frattini quotient&quot; of ) has order formula_10, then &quot;k&quot; is the smallest number of generators for (that is, the smallest cardinality of a generating set for ). In particular a finite &quot;p&quot;-group is cyclic if and only if its Frattini quotient is cyclic (of order &quot;p&quot;). A finite &quot;p&quot;-group is elementary abelian if and only if its Frattini subgroup is the trivial group, formula_11.
* If and are finite, then formula_12.

An example of a group with nontrivial Frattini subgroup is the cyclic group of order formula_13, where &quot;p&quot; is prime, generated by &quot;a&quot;, say; here, formula_14.

<text>Ponerinae, the ponerine ants, is a subfamily of ants in the Poneromorph subfamilies group, with about 1,600 species in 47 extant genera, including &quot;Dinoponera gigantea&quot; - one of the world&#x27;s largest species of ant. Mated workers have replaced the queen as the functional egg-layers in several species of ponerine ants. In such queenless species, the reproductive status of workers can only be determined through ovarian dissections.

== Description and identification ==
Ponerinae are most easily identified from other subfamilies by possessing a single-segmented petiole and the gaster usually being constricted between the first and second segments. &quot;Odontomachus&quot; lack this constriction, but these can be identified from their elongate, straight mandibles attached close together along the front margin of the head and with teeth only at the mandible tips. They are rare examples of stinging ants. Females have 12-segmented antennae, whereas males have 13-segmented antennae.

== Behavior ==
These ants typically nest in soil, forest litter, or rotting logs, and are predacious. They primarily prey on isopods. They mostly live in small colonies of up to 200 workers. They can be found mostly in tropical environments, but have been found in southeastern Canada and New York.

<doc id="540715" wikidata="Q814451" url="?curid=540715" title="Behavioralism">
<text>Behavioralism is an approach in the philosophy of science, describing the scope of the fields now collectively called the behavioral sciences; this approach dominated the field until the late 20th century. Behavioralism attempts to explain human behavior from an unbiased, neutral point of view, focusing only on what can be verified by direct observation, preferably using statistical and quantitative methods. In doing so, it rejects attempts to study internal human phenomena such as thoughts, subjective experiences, or human well-being. The rejection of this paradigm as overly-restrictive would lead to the rise of cognitive approaches in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

==Origins==
From 1942 through the 1970s, behavioralism gained support. It was probably Dwight Waldo who coined the term for the first time in a book called &quot;Political Science in the United States&quot; which was released in 1956. It was David Easton however who popularized the term. It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science. The origins of behavioralism is often attributed to the work of University of Chicago professor Charles Merriam, who in the 1920s and 1930s emphasized the importance of examining political behavior of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.

==As a political approach==
Prior to the &quot;behavioralist revolution&quot;, political science being a science at all was disputed. Critics saw the study of politics as being primarily qualitative and normative, and claimed that it lacked a scientific method necessary to be deemed a science. Behavioralists used strict methodology and empirical research to validate their study as a social science. The behavioralist approach was innovative because it changed the attitude of the purpose of inquiry. It moved toward research that was supported by verifiable facts. In the period of 1954-63, Gabriel Almond spread behavioralism to comparative politics by creation of a committee in SSRC. During its rise in popularity in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, behavioralism challenged the realist and liberal approaches, which the behavioralists called &quot;traditionalism&quot;, and other studies of political behavior that was not based on fact.

To understand political behavior, behavioralism uses the following methods: sampling, interviewing, scoring and scaling, and statistical analysis.

Behavioralism studies how individuals behave in group positions realistically rather than how they should behave. For example, a study of the United States Congress might include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an &#x27;arena of actions&#x27; and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.

==Meaning of the term==
David Easton was the first to differentiate behavioralism from behaviorism in the 1950s (behaviorism is the term mostly associated with psychology). In the early 1940s, behaviorism itself was referred to as a behavioral science and later referred to as behaviorism. However, Easton sought to differentiate between the two disciplines:

Behavioralism was not a clearly defined movement for those who were thought to be behavioralists. It was more clearly definable by those who were opposed to it, because they were describing it in terms of the things within the newer trends that they found objectionable. So some would define behavioralism as an attempt to apply the methods of natural sciences to human behavior. Others would define it as an excessive emphasis upon quantification. Others as individualistic reductionism. From the inside, the practitioners were of different minds as what it was that constituted behavioralism. [...] And few of us were in agreement.

With this in mind, behavioralism resisted a single definition. Dwight Waldo emphasized that behavioralism itself is unclear, calling it &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;obscure.&quot; Easton agreed, stating, &quot;every man puts his own emphasis and thereby becomes his own behavioralist&quot; and attempts to completely define behavioralism are fruitless. From the beginning, behavioralism was a political, not a scientific concept. Moreover, since behavioralism is not a research tradition, but a political movement, definitions of behavioralism follow what behavioralists wanted. Therefore, most introductions to the subject emphasize value-free research. This is evidenced by Easton&#x27;s eight &quot;intellectual foundation stones&quot; of behavioralism:
* &quot;Regularities&quot; – The generalization and explanation of regularities.
* &quot;Commitment to Verification&quot; – The ability to verify ones generalizations.
* &quot;Techniques&quot; – An experimental attitude toward techniques.
* &quot;Quantification&quot; – Express results as numbers where possible or meaningful.
* &quot;Values&quot; – Keeping ethical assessment and empirical explanations distinct.
* &quot;Systemization&quot; – Considering the importance of theory in research.
* &quot;Pure Science&quot; – Deferring to pure science rather than applied science.
* &quot;Integration&quot; – Integrating social sciences and value.

==Objectivity and value-neutrality==
According to David Easton, behavioralism sought to be &quot;analytic, not substantive, general rather than particular, and explanatory rather than ethical.&quot; In this, the theory seeks to evaluate political behavior without &quot;introducing any ethical evaluations.&quot; Rodger Beehler cites this as &quot;their insistence on distinguishing between facts and values.&quot;

==Criticism==
The approach has come under fire from both conservatives and radicals for the purported value-neutrality. Conservatives see the distinction between values and facts as a way of undermining the possibility of political philosophy. Neal Riemer believes behavioralism dismisses &quot;the task of ethical recommendation&quot; because behavioralists believe &quot;truth or falsity of values (democracy, equality, and freedom, etc.) cannot be established scientifically and are beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry.&quot;

Christian Bay believed behavioralism was a pseudopolitical science and that it did not represent &quot;genuine&quot; political research. Bay objected to empirical consideration taking precedence over normative and moral examination of politics.

Behavioralism initially represented a movement away from &quot;naive empiricism&quot;, but as an approach has been criticized for &quot;naive scientism&quot;. Additionally, radical critics believe that the separation of fact from value makes the empirical study of politics impossible.

===Crick&#x27;s critique===
British scholar Bernard Crick in &quot;The American Science of Politics&quot; (1959), attacked the behavioral approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, but little known in Britain. He identified and rejected six basic premises and in each case argued the traditional approach was superior to behavioralism:
#research can discover uniformities in human behavior,
#these uniformities could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements,
#quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analyzed statistically,
#political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions,
#value-free research was the ideal, and
#social scientists should search for a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.

<text>The Bad River (Lakota: &quot;wakpá-šiča&quot;; &quot;river-bad&quot;) is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, in central South Dakota in the United States.
The river is formed at Philip, South Dakota, by the confluence of its North and South forks. The North Fork Bad River rises in eastern Pennington County and flows east-southeast to Philip, while the South Fork Bad River rises at the confluence of Whitewater Creek and Big Buffalo Creek in Jackson County, within the Buffalo Gap National Grassland, and flows northeast to Philip. The main stem of the Bad River flows east-northeast from Philip, passing Midland and Capa. It joins the Missouri at Fort Pierre. The Bad drainage basin is about and is located south of the Cheyenne River in the Pierre Hills and Southern Plateaus.

The river basin is noted for deposits of manganese and fuller&#x27;s earth. At the river mouth near Fort Pierre, the Bad River flood stage contains large quantities of silt. The Bad carries hard water of generally poor quality.

The name recalls an incident around the spring of 1738 when a flash flood on the Bad River inundated the camp of a north-traveling band, causing a large loss of life, including all their horses. The Bad River was called the Teton River by Lewis &amp; Clark in 1804 as the place where they parlayed with Teton Lakota, but the name did not catch. 
At Fort Pierre, the river has a mean annual discharge of .

==Industrial use==
As of November 2019, TC Energy was applying for permits in the state to tap the Bad River to use water for the construction of Phase 4 of the Keystone pipeline, including camp construction to house transient construction workers.

<doc id="540732" wikidata="Q2063099" url="?curid=540732" title="Poincaré duality">
<text>In mathematics, the Poincaré duality theorem, named after Henri Poincaré, is a basic result on the structure of the homology and cohomology groups of manifolds. It states that if &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional oriented closed manifold (compact and without boundary), then the &quot;k&quot;th cohomology group of &quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to the th homology group of &quot;M&quot;, for all integers &quot;k&quot; 
: formula_1

Poincaré duality holds for any coefficient ring, so long as one has taken an orientation with respect to that coefficient ring; in particular, since every manifold has a unique orientation mod 2, Poincaré duality holds mod 2 without any assumption of orientation.

== History ==
A form of Poincaré duality was first stated, without proof, by Henri Poincaré in 1893. It was stated in terms of Betti numbers: The &quot;k&quot;th and th Betti numbers of a closed (i.e., compact and without boundary) orientable &quot;n&quot;-manifold are equal. The &quot;cohomology&quot; concept was at that time about 40 years from being clarified. In his 1895 paper &quot;Analysis Situs&quot;, Poincaré tried to prove the theorem using topological intersection theory, which he had invented. Criticism of his work by Poul Heegaard led him to realize that his proof was seriously flawed. In the first two complements to &quot;Analysis Situs&quot;, Poincaré gave a new proof in terms of dual triangulations.

Poincaré duality did not take on its modern form until the advent of cohomology in the 1930s, when Eduard Čech and Hassler Whitney invented the cup and cap products and formulated Poincaré duality in these new terms.

== Modern formulation ==
The modern statement of the Poincaré duality theorem is in terms of homology and cohomology: if &quot;M&quot; is a closed oriented &quot;n&quot;-manifold, then there is a canonically defined isomorphism formula_2 for any integer &quot;k&quot;. To define such an isomorphism, one chooses a fixed fundamental class [&quot;M&quot;] of &quot;M&quot;, which will exist if formula_3 is oriented. Then the isomorphism is defined by mapping an element formula_4 to the cap product formula_5.

Homology and cohomology groups are defined to be zero for negative degrees, so Poincaré duality in particular implies that the homology and cohomology groups of orientable closed &quot;n&quot;-manifolds are zero for degrees bigger than &quot;n&quot;.

Here, homology and cohomology are integral, but the isomorphism remains valid over any coefficient ring. In the case where an oriented manifold is not compact, one has to replace homology by Borel–Moore homology
: formula_6
or replace cohomology by cohomology with compact support
: formula_7

== Dual cell structures ==
Given a triangulated manifold, there is a corresponding dual polyhedral decomposition. The dual polyhedral decomposition is a cell decomposition of the manifold such that the &quot;k&quot;-cells of the dual polyhedral decomposition are in bijective correspondence with the (formula_8)-cells of the triangulation, generalizing the notion of dual polyhedra.

Precisely, let formula_9 be a triangulation of an formula_10-manifold formula_3. Let formula_12 be a simplex of formula_9. Let formula_14 be a top-dimensional simplex of formula_9 containing formula_12, so we can think of formula_12 as a subset of the vertices of formula_14. Define the dual cell formula_19 corresponding to formula_12 so that formula_21 is the convex hull in formula_14 of the barycentres of all subsets of the vertices of formula_14 that contain formula_12. One can check that if formula_12 is formula_26-dimensional, then formula_19 is an formula_28-dimensional cell. Moreover, the dual cells to formula_9 form a CW-decomposition of formula_3, and the only (formula_31)-dimensional dual cell that intersects an formula_26-cell formula_12 is formula_19. Thus the pairing formula_35 given by taking intersections induces an isomorphism formula_36, where formula_37 is the cellular homology of the triangulation formula_9, and formula_39 and formula_40 are the cellular homologies and cohomologies of the dual polyhedral/CW decomposition the manifold respectively. The fact that this is an isomorphism of chain complexes is a proof of Poincaré duality. Roughly speaking, this amounts to the fact that the boundary relation for the triangulation formula_9 is the incidence relation for the dual polyhedral decomposition under the correspondence formula_42.

=== Naturality ===
Note that formula_43 is a contravariant functor while formula_44 is covariant. The family of isomorphisms
: formula_45
is natural in the following sense: if
: formula_46
is a continuous map between two oriented &quot;n&quot;-manifolds which is compatible with orientation, i.e. which maps the fundamental class of &quot;M&quot; to the fundamental class of &quot;N&quot;, then
: formula_47
where formula_48 and formula_49 are the maps induced by formula_50 in homology and cohomology, respectively.

Note the very strong and crucial hypothesis that formula_50 maps the fundamental class of &quot;M&quot; to the fundamental class of &quot;N&quot;. Naturality does not hold for an arbitrary continuous map formula_50, since in general formula_49 is not an injection on cohomology. For example, if formula_50 is a covering map then it maps the fundamental class of &quot;M&quot; to a multiple of the fundamental class of &quot;N&quot;. This multiple is the degree of the map formula_50.

== Bilinear pairings formulation ==

Assuming the manifold &quot;M&quot; is compact, boundaryless, and orientable, let
: formula_56
denote the torsion subgroup of formula_57 and let
: formula_58
be the free part – all homology groups taken with integer coefficients in this section. Then there are bilinear maps which are duality pairings (explained below).
: formula_59
and
: formula_60.

Here formula_61 is the quotient of the rationals by the integers, taken as an additive group. Notice that in the torsion linking form, there is a −1 in the dimension, so the paired dimensions add up to , rather than to &quot;n&quot;.

The first form is typically called the &quot;intersection product&quot; and the 2nd the &quot;torsion linking form&quot;. Assuming the manifold &quot;M&quot; is smooth, the intersection product is computed by perturbing the homology classes to be transverse and computing their oriented intersection number. For the torsion linking form, one computes the pairing of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; by realizing &quot;nx&quot; as the boundary of some class &quot;z&quot;. The form then takes the value equal to the fraction whose numerator is the transverse intersection number of &quot;z&quot; with &quot;y&quot;, and whose denominator is &quot;n&quot;.

The statement that the pairings are duality pairings means that the adjoint maps 
: formula_62
and
: formula_63
are isomorphisms of groups.

This result is an application of Poincaré duality
: formula_64,
together with the universal coefficient theorem, which gives an identification 
: formula_65
and 
: formula_66.
Thus, Poincaré duality says that formula_67 and formula_68 are isomorphic, although there is no natural map giving the isomorphism, and similarly formula_56 and formula_70 are also isomorphic, though not naturally.

;Middle dimension
While for most dimensions, Poincaré duality induces a bilinear &quot;pairing&quot; between different homology groups, in the middle dimension it induces a bilinear &quot;form&quot; on a single homology group. The resulting intersection form is a very important topological invariant.

What is meant by &quot;middle dimension&quot; depends on parity. For even dimension , which is more common, this is literally the middle dimension &quot;k&quot;, and there is a form on the free part of the middle homology:
: formula_71

By contrast, for odd dimension , which is less commonly discussed, it is most simply the lower middle dimension &quot;k&quot;, and there is a form on the torsion part of the homology in that dimension:
: formula_72
However, there is also a pairing between the free part of the homology in the lower middle dimension &quot;k&quot; and in the upper middle dimension :
: formula_73
The resulting groups, while not a single group with a bilinear form, are a simple chain complex and are studied in algebraic L-theory.

;Applications
This approach to Poincaré duality was used by Józef Przytycki and Akira Yasuhara to give an elementary homotopy and diffeomorphism classification of 3-dimensional lens spaces.

== Application to Euler Characteristics ==
An immediate result from Poincaré duality is that any closed odd-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; has Euler characteristic zero, which in turn gives that any manifold that bounds has even Euler characteristic.

== Thom isomorphism formulation ==

Poincaré duality is closely related to the Thom isomorphism theorem. Let formula_3 be a compact, boundaryless oriented &quot;n&quot;-manifold, and the product of &quot;M&quot; with itself. Let &quot;V&quot; be an open tubular neighbourhood of the diagonal in . Consider the maps:
:* formula_75 the Homology cross product
:* formula_76 inclusion.
:* formula_77 excision map where formula_78 is the normal disc bundle of the diagonal in formula_79.
:* formula_80 the Thom isomorphism. This map is well-defined as there is a standard identification formula_81 which is an oriented bundle, so the Thom isomorphism applies.

Combined, this gives a map formula_82, which is the &quot;intersection product&quot;, generalizing the intersection product discussed above. A similar argument with the Künneth theorem gives the &quot;torsion linking form&quot;.

This formulation of Poincaré duality has become popular as it defines Poincaré duality for any generalized homology theory, given a Künneth theorem and a Thom isomorphism for that homology theory. A Thom isomorphism theorem for a homology theory is now viewed as the generalized notion of orientability for that theory. For example, a spinC-structure on a manifold is a precise analog of an orientation within complex topological k-theory.

== Generalizations and related results ==
The Poincaré–Lefschetz duality theorem is a generalisation for manifolds with boundary. In the non-orientable case, taking into account the sheaf of local orientations, one can give a statement that is independent of orientability: see twisted Poincaré duality.

&quot;Blanchfield duality&quot; is a version of Poincaré duality which provides an isomorphism between the homology of an abelian covering space of a manifold and the corresponding cohomology with compact supports. It is used to get basic structural results about the Alexander module and can be used to define the signatures of a knot.

With the development of homology theory to include K-theory and other &quot;extraordinary&quot; theories from about 1955, it was realised that the homology formula_83 could be replaced by other theories, once the products on manifolds were constructed; and there are now textbook treatments in generality. More specifically, there is a general Poincaré duality theorem for a generalized homology theory which requires a notion of orientation with respect to a homology theory, and is formulated in terms of a generalized Thom isomorphism theorem. The Thom isomorphism theorem in this regard can be considered as the germinal idea for Poincaré duality for generalized homology theories.

Verdier duality is the appropriate generalization to (possibly singular) geometric objects, such as analytic spaces or schemes, while intersection homology was developed by Robert MacPherson and Mark Goresky for stratified spaces, such as real or complex algebraic varieties, precisely so as to generalise Poincaré duality to such stratified spaces.

There are many other forms of geometric duality in algebraic topology, including Lefschetz duality, Alexander duality, Hodge duality, and S-duality.

More algebraically, one can abstract the notion of a Poincaré complex, which is an algebraic object that behaves like the singular chain complex of a manifold, notably satisfying Poincaré duality on its homology groups, with respect to a distinguished element (corresponding to the fundamental class). These are used in surgery theory to algebraicize questions about manifolds. A Poincaré space is one whose singular chain complex is a Poincaré complex. These are not all manifolds, but their failure to be manifolds can be measured by obstruction theory.

<text>Cyril William &quot;Bill&quot; Doody (February 26, 1931 – December 27, 2005) was a member of the Senate of Canada representing Newfoundland and Labrador. Doody was active in provincial politics and was first elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly in 1971 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador.

Doody was born in St. John&#x27;s and was educated at Saint Bonaventure&#x27;s College. In 1971, he resigned from his position as managing director of a supermarket to run for political office. He became Minister of Mines, Agriculture and Resources when Frank Moores formed his government in 1972. In 1975, Doody became the province&#x27;s finance minister. After Moores resigned, Doody was widely expected to succeed him but was defeated by Brian Peckford in the March 17, 1979 PC leadership convention. Premier Peckford appointed Doody Minister of Mines and Energy.

In October 1979, several months after the 1979 Newfoundland election, Doody left provincial politics and was appointed to the Senate by then Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Joe Clark. He served as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate from September 17, 1984 until 1991.

When, in December 2004, the Progressive Conservatives merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada, Doody decided not to join the new formation. Instead, he continued to sit in the Senate as a member of a five-person Progressive Conservative caucus consisting of himself, Norman Atkins, Lowell Murray, Elaine McCoy and Nancy Ruth. He was to retire from the Senate in February 2006, but died almost two months prior to his scheduled retirement.

<doc id="540761" wikidata="Q2126786" url="?curid=540761" title="White River (Missouri River tributary)">
<text>The White River is a Missouri River tributary that flows through the U.S. states of Nebraska and South Dakota. The name stems from the water&#x27;s white-gray color, a function of eroded sand, clay, and volcanic ash carried by the river from its source near the Badlands. Draining a basin of about , about of which is in South Dakota, the stream flows through a region of sparsely populated hills, plateaus, and badlands.

The White River rises in northwestern Nebraska, in the Pine Ridge escarpment north of Harrison, at an elevation of above sea level. It flows southeast then northeast past Fort Robinson and north of Crawford. It crosses into southwestern South Dakota and flows north across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, then northeast, receiving Wounded Knee Creek and flowing between units of Badlands National Park. It flows east-northeast and southeast at the northern edge of the reservation, forming the northern boundary of the reservation and the southern boundary of Buffalo Gap National Grassland. It receives the Little White River about south of Murdo, and flows east to join the Missouri in Lake Francis Case about southwest of Chamberlain.

The river sometimes has no surface flow due to the dry climate surrounding its badlands and prairie basin, though thunderstorms can cause brief intense flow. The river near Chamberlain flows year-round. As of 2001, the White River had generally good-quality water.

==Industrial use==
As of November 2019, TC Energy was applying for permits in the state to tap the White River to use water for the construction of Phase 4 of the Keystone pipeline, including camp construction to house transient construction workers.

While original mystery film series were based on novels, by the 1940s many were sourced from comics and radio series. Towards the 1940s these series were predominantly produced as b-movies, with nearly no mystery series being developed by the 1950s.

Around the 2020s a wave of popular theatrical straight mystery films were released theatrically including Kenneth Brannagh&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017) and Rian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019) as well as on streaming services with the parodic &quot;Murder Mystery&quot; (2019) starring Adam Sandler.

==Definition and characteristics==
Mystery films mainly focus on a crime or a puzzle, usually a murder, which must then be solved by policemen, private detectives, or amateur sleuths. The viewer is presented with a series of suspects who have a motive to commit the crime but did not actually do it, and whom the investigator must eliminate during the course of the investigation. At times the viewer is presented with information not available to the main character. The central character usually explores the unsolved crime, unmasks the perpetrator, and puts an end to the effects of the villainy.

During the early 20th century, there was substantial overlap between the genres of detective film and horror film, and the term &quot;mystery&quot; was used to encompass both.

==History==
The works of Arthur Conan Doyle were often adapted to the screen in early cinema, specifically with Sherlock Holmes such as &quot;Sherlock Holmes Baffled&quot; (1900). Gary Don Rhodes wrote that the large volume of detective films released in the 1910s either owed to Sherlock Holmes but that contemporary reviews such as that of &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; in 1911 bemoaned the lack of a proper Sherlock Holmes adaptation in &quot;Doctor Doyle&#x27;s finished style.&quot; By 1915, the same trade paper stated that &quot;strange as it may seem, the story of crime mystery is fast degenerating into one of stock properties.&quot;

There were several mystery and detective films produced during the silent film era, including numerous films involving Sherlock Holmes, Boston Blackie and The Lone Wolf. Mystery and detective films were among the most popular genres of the silent film era. This ranged to American, British, German and Danish adaptations of Sherlock Holmes and European series like Nick Carter, Nat Pinkerton and Miss Nobody.
With the beginning of sound film, mystery film series came into their own with Philo Vance in the 1929 film &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot;.A series of films continued in until 1947. Other series followed such as Charlie Chan which began in 1931 and ended in 1949 with 44 films produced.

In the 1930s, most of the major Hollywood film studios produced mystery series, with MGM having Nick and Nora Charles and Joel and Garda Sloane, Warner Bros. having Perry Mason, Torchy Blane, Brass Bancroft and Nancy Drew. Universal had Bill Crane while Fox had Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. 
American mystery film series of the 1930s predominantly relied on mystery literature for inspiration. About every character from the 1930s drew from literature, such as Charlie Chan, Nick and Nora Charles, Thatcher Colt, Perry Mason, and Mr. Wong. The 1930s featured many female detectives of various ages from Nancy Drew, Torchy Blane and Hildegarde Withers while the 1940s had none. 
Productions in the 1930s were occasionally A-budget pictures such as &quot;The Black Camel&quot; (1931), &quot;Aresene Lupin&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934). 

By the 1940s, film detectives came from multiple sources such as radio and comic strips and many others had original scripts. MGM, Warner Brothers, and Paramount had generally halted their production of mystery films by 1942 leaving production to these films being made by RKO, Columbia, Universal and other more minor studios. This led to what author Ron Backer described as 1940s mystery films as being &quot;almost always B-productions&quot; with actors who were &quot;past their prime&quot;. These included Chester Morris as Boston Blackie, Warner Baxter as the Crime Doctor, Warren William as the Lone Wolf and Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes. These smaller budget films led to more major productions such as John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) while &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (1944) introduced the character Philip Marlowe to film. Marlowe would appear again in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946) while other films author Martin Rubin deemed as notable detective mysteries included &quot;Laura&quot; (1944). These detective films drew upon thriller and thriller-related genres with their nocturnal atmosphere and style influenced by expressionism. They often overlapped with &quot;film noir&quot;, which arose in the mid-1940s and was coined by French critics in 1946. The style was not acknowledge by American filmmakers, critics or audiences while these films were being developed until the 1970s.

Mystery films series disappeared by the 1950s. With the exception of Miss Marple films in the 1960s, it was rare to find films with a female lead that had any sequels. Bran Nicol found that the more traditional &quot;clue-puzzle mystery&quot; was &quot;well-served&quot; by 1960s and 70s film adaptations like &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot; (1965), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), and &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978), the decades following it left mystery adaptations to be made for television as the &quot;default home of sumptuous Golden Age adaptations&quot; 

Eric Sandberg (&quot;Crime Fiction Studies&quot;) stated that while film streaming services were predominantly dominated by iterations of Nordic &quot;noir&quot; and police procedurals, there have been works inspired the classical mystery fiction, such as the parodic &quot;Murder Mystery&quot; starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston which was one of Netflix&#x27;s most popular films of 2019. Sandberg noted that only by the 2020s, specifically with Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 2017 &quot;The Murder on the Orient Express&quot; had the genre been financially successful again with more than $350 million grossed worldwide, leading to a sequel &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (2022). Other variations of included Rian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Knives Out&quot; which was not an adaptation of a golden age work, but was Johnson&#x27;s first foray into the &quot;puzzle-mystery&quot; style, and was the second highest-grossing film in America in 2019.

<doc id="540772" wikidata="Q3695436" url="?curid=540772" title="RC time constant">
<text>The RC time constant, denoted &quot;&quot; (lowercase tau), the time constant (in seconds) of a resistor–capacitor circuit (RC circuit), is equal to the product of the circuit resistance (in ohms) and the circuit capacitance (in farads): 
:formula_1

It is the time required to charge the capacitor, through the resistor, from an initial charge voltage of zero to approximately 63.2% of the value of an applied DC voltage, or to discharge the capacitor through the same resistor to approximately 36.8% of its initial charge voltage. These values are derived from the mathematical constant &quot;e&quot;, where formula_2 and formula_3. The following formulae use it, assuming a constant voltage applied across the capacitor and resistor in series, to determine the voltage across the capacitor against time:

:Charging toward applied voltage (initially zero voltage across capacitor, constant across resistor and capacitor together) formula_4
:Discharging toward zero from initial voltage (initially across capacitor, constant zero voltage across resistor and capacitor together) formula_5

==Cutoff frequency==
The time constant formula_6 is related to the RC circuit&#x27;s cutoff frequency &quot;f&quot;c, by
:formula_7
or, equivalently,
:formula_8
where resistance in ohms and capacitance in farads yields the time constant in seconds or the cutoff frequency in hertz (Hz). The cutoff frequency when expressed as an angular frequency formula_9 is simply the reciprocal of the time constant.

Short conditional equations using the value for formula_10:
:&quot;f&quot;c in Hz = 159155 / τ in μs
:τ in μs = 159155 / &quot;f&quot;c in Hz

Other useful equations are:
:rise time (20% to 80%) formula_11
:rise time (10% to 90%) formula_12

In more complicated circuits consisting of more than one resistor and/or capacitor, the open-circuit time constant method provides a way of approximating the cutoff frequency by computing a sum of several RC time constants.

==Delay==

The signal delay of a wire or other circuit, measured as group delay or phase delay or the effective propagation delay of a digital transition, may be dominated by resistive-capacitive effects, depending on the distance and other parameters, or may alternatively be dominated by inductive, wave, and speed of light effects in other realms.

Resistive-capacitive delay, or RC delay, hinders the further increasing of speed in microelectronic integrated circuits. When the feature size becomes smaller and smaller to increase the clock speed, the RC delay plays an increasingly important role. This delay can be reduced by replacing the aluminum conducting wire by copper, thus reducing the resistance; it can also be reduced by changing the interlayer dielectric (typically silicon dioxide) to low-dielectric-constant materials, thus reducing the capacitance.

The typical digital propagation delay of a resistive wire is about half of R times C; since both R and C are proportional to wire length, the delay scales as the square of wire length. Charge spreads by diffusion in such a wire, as explained by Lord Kelvin in the mid nineteenth century. Until Heaviside discovered that Maxwell&#x27;s equations imply wave propagation when sufficient inductance is in the circuit, this square diffusion relationship was thought to provide a fundamental limit to the improvement of long-distance telegraph cables. That old analysis was superseded in the telegraph domain, but remains relevant for long on-chip interconnects.

<text>An art film, art cinema, or arthouse film is typically an independent film, aimed at a niche market rather than a mass market audience. It is &quot;intended to be a serious, artistic work, often experimental and not designed for mass appeal&quot;, &quot;made primarily for aesthetic reasons rather than commercial profit&quot;, and containing &quot;unconventional or highly symbolic content&quot;.

Film critics and film studies scholars typically define an art film as possessing &quot;formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films&quot;. These qualities can include (among other elements) a sense of social realism; an emphasis on the authorial expressiveness of the director; and a focus on the thoughts, dreams, or motivations of characters, as opposed to the unfolding of a clear, goal-driven story. Film scholars David Bordwell and Barry Keith Grant describe art cinema as &quot;a film genre, with its own distinct conventions&quot;.

Art film producers usually present their films at special theaters (repertory cinemas or, in the U.S., art-house cinemas) and at film festivals. The term &quot;art film&quot; is much more widely used in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia, compared to mainland Europe, where the terms auteur films and national cinema (e.g. German national cinema) are used instead. Since they are aimed at small, niche-market audiences, art films rarely acquire the financial backing that would permit the large production budgets associated with widely released blockbuster films. Art film directors make up for these constraints by creating a different type of film, one that typically uses lesser-known film actors or even amateur actors, and modest sets to make films that focus much more on developing ideas, exploring new narrative techniques, and attempting new film-making conventions.

Such films contrast sharply with mainstream blockbuster films, which are usually geared more towards linear storytelling and mainstream entertainment. Film critic Roger Ebert called &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, a critically acclaimed 1994 art film, &quot;largely a cerebral experience&quot; that one enjoys &quot;because of what you know about film&quot;. That said, some art films may widen their appeal by offering certain elements of more familiar genres such as documentary or biography. For promotion, art films rely on the publicity generated from film critics&#x27; reviews; discussion of the film by arts columnists, commentators, and bloggers; and word-of-mouth promotion by audience members. Since art films have small initial investment costs, they only need to appeal to a small portion of mainstream audiences to become financially viable.

==History==
===Antecedents: 1910–1920s===
The forerunners of art films include Italian silent film &quot;L&#x27;Inferno&quot; (1911), D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) and the works of Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, who influenced the development of European cinema movements for decades. Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; (1925) was a revolutionary propaganda film he used to test his theories of using film editing to produce the greatest emotional response from an audience. The international critical renown that Eisenstein garnered from this film enabled him to direct &quot;&quot; as part of a grand 10th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917. He later directed &quot;The General Line&quot; in 1929. 
The film by Alexander Dovzhenko &quot;Earth&quot; (1930), filmed under the influence of Eisenstein, is defined by some critics as the pinnacle of art cinema.

Art films were also influenced by films by Spanish avant-garde creators, such as Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí (who made &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; in 1930), and by the French playwright and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, whose 1932 avant-garde film &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; uses oneiric images throughout, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks. In the 1920s, film societies began advocating the notion that films could be divided into &quot;entertainment cinema directed towards a mass audience and a serious art cinema aimed at an intellectual audience&quot;. In England, Alfred Hitchcock and Ivor Montagu formed a film society and imported films they thought were &quot;artistic achievements&quot;, such as &quot;Soviet films of dialectical montage, and the expressionist films of the Universum Film A.G. (UFA) studios in Germany&quot;.

&quot;Cinéma pur&quot;, a French avant-garde film movement in the 1920s and 1930s, also influenced the development of the idea of art film. The &quot;cinema pur&quot; film movement included several notable Dada artists. The Dadaists used film to transcend narrative storytelling conventions, bourgeois traditions, and conventional Aristotelian notions of time and space by creating a flexible montage of time and space.
The &quot;cinema pur&quot; movement was influenced by German &quot;absolute&quot; filmmakers such as Hans Richter, Walter Ruttmann and Viking Eggeling. Richter falsely claimed that his 1921 film &quot;Rhythmus 21&quot; was the first abstract film ever created. In fact, he was preceded by the Italian Futurists Bruno Corra and Arnaldo Ginna between 1911 and 1912 (as reported in the &quot;Futurist Manifesto of Cinema&quot;), as well as by fellow German artist Walter Ruttmann, who produced &quot;Lichtspiel Opus 1&quot; in 1920. Nevertheless, Richter&#x27;s film &quot;Rhythmus 21&quot; is considered an important early abstract film.

The first British &quot;art cinema&quot; was temporarily opened at the Palais de Luxe in London in 1929 by Elsie Cohen. She went on to establish a permanent location at the Academy Cinema in Oxford Street in 1931.

Arthouse cinemas that specialized in the presentation of art films emerged on the east coast of the United States towards the end of the 1920s. Such cinemas were widespread in both the USA and Europe.

===1930s–1950s===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood films could be divided into the artistic aspirations of literary adaptations like John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935) and Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940), and the money-making &quot;popular-genre films&quot; such as gangster thrillers. William Siska argues that Italian neorealist films from the mid-to-late 1940s, such as &quot;Open City&quot; (1945), &quot;Paisa&quot; (1946), and &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948) can be deemed as another &quot;conscious art film movement&quot;.

In the late 1940s, the U.S. public&#x27;s perception that Italian neorealist films and other serious European fare were different from mainstream Hollywood films was reinforced by the development of &quot;arthouse cinemas&quot; in major U.S. cities and college towns. After the Second World War, &quot;...a growing segment of the American film going public was wearying of mainstream Hollywood films&quot;, and they went to the newly created art-film theaters to see &quot;alternatives to the films playing in main-street movie palaces&quot;. Films shown in these art cinemas included &quot;British, foreign-language, and independent American films, as well as documentaries and revivals of Hollywood classics&quot;. Films such as Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Open City&quot; and Mackendrick&#x27;s &quot;Tight Little Island&quot; (&quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;), &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; were shown to substantial U.S. audiences.

In the late 1950s, French filmmakers began to produce films that were influenced by Italian Neorealism and classical Hollywood cinema, a style that critics called the French New Wave. Although never a formally organized movement, New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful iconoclasm, and their films are an example of European art cinema. Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. Some of the most prominent pioneers among the group, including François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette, began as critics for the film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;. Auteur theory holds that the director is the &quot;author&quot; of his films, with a personal signature visible from film to film.

===1960s–1970s===

The French New Wave movement continued into the 1960s. During the 1960s, the term &quot;art film&quot; began to be much more widely used in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., the term is often defined very broadly to include foreign-language (non-English) &quot;auteur&quot; films, independent films, experimental films, documentaries and short films. In the 1960s, &quot;art film&quot; became a euphemism in the U.S. for racy Italian and French B-movies. By the 1970s, the term was used to describe sexually explicit European films with artistic structure such as the Swedish film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot;. In the U.S., the term &quot;art film&quot; may refer to films by modern American artists, including Andy Warhol with his 1969 film &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, but is sometimes used very loosely to refer to the broad range of films shown in repertory theaters or &quot;art house cinemas&quot;. With this approach, a broad range of films, such as a 1960s Hitchcock film, a 1970s experimental underground film, a European auteur film, a U.S. &quot;independent&quot; film, and even a mainstream foreign-language film (with subtitles) might all fall under the rubric of &quot;art house films&quot;.

===1980s–2000s===
By the 1980s and 1990s, the term &quot;art film&quot; became conflated with &quot;independent film&quot; in the U.S., which shares many of the same stylistic traits. Companies such as Miramax Films distributed independent films that were deemed commercially viable. When major motion-picture studios noted the niche appeal of independent films, they created special divisions dedicated to non-mainstream fare, such as the Fox Searchlight Pictures division of Twentieth Century Fox, the Focus Features division of Universal, the Sony Pictures Classics division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Paramount Vantage division of Paramount. Film critics have debated whether films from these divisions can be considered &quot;independent films&quot;, given they have financial backing from major studios.

In 2007, Professor Camille Paglia argued in her article &quot;Art movies: R.I.P.&quot; that &quot;[a]side from Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Godfather&quot; series, with its deft flashbacks and gritty social realism, ...[there is not]... a single film produced over the past 35 years that is arguably of equal philosophical weight or virtuosity of execution to Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; or &quot;Persona&quot;&quot;. Paglia states that young people from the 2000s do not &quot;have patience for the long, slow take that deep-think European directors once specialized in&quot;, an approach which gave &quot;luxurious scrutiny of the tiniest facial expressions or the chilly sweep of a sterile room or bleak landscape&quot;.

According to director, producer, and distributor Roger Corman, the &quot;1950s and 1960s was the time of the art film&#x27;s greatest influence. After that, the influence waned. Hollywood absorbed the lessons of the European films and incorporated those lessons into their films.&quot; Corman states that &quot;viewers could see something of the essence of the European art cinema in the Hollywood movies of the seventies... [and so], art film, which was never just a matter of European cinema, increasingly became an actual world cinema—albeit one that struggled to gain wide recognition&quot;. Corman notes that, &quot;Hollywood itself has expanded, radically, its aesthetic range... because the range of subjects at hand has expanded to include the very conditions of image-making, of movie production, of the new and prismatic media-mediated experience of modernity. There&#x27;s a new audience that has learned about art films at the video store.&quot; Corman states that &quot;there is currently the possibility of a rebirth&quot; of American art film.

==Deviations from mainstream film norms==
Film scholar David Bordwell outlined the academic definition of &quot;art film&quot; in a 1979 article entitled &quot;The Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice&quot;, which contrasts art films with the mainstream films of classical Hollywood cinema. Mainstream Hollywood-style films use a clear narrative form to organize the film into a series of &quot;causally related events taking place in space and time&quot;, with every scene driving towards a goal. The plot of mainstream films is driven by a well-defined protagonist, fleshed out with clear characters, and strengthened with &quot;question-and-answer logic, problem-solving routines, [and] deadline plot structures&quot;. The film is then tied together with fast pacing, a musical soundtrack to cue the appropriate audience emotions, and tight, seamless editing.

In contrast, Bordwell states that &quot;the art cinema motivates its narrative by two principles: realism and authorial expressiveness&quot;. Art films deviate from the mainstream &quot;classical&quot; norms of film making in that they typically deal with more episodic narrative structures with a &quot;loosening of the chain of cause and effect&quot;.

Mainstream films also deal with moral dilemmas or identity crises, but these issues are usually resolved by the end of the film. In art films, the dilemmas are probed and investigated in a pensive fashion, but usually without a clear resolution at the end of the film.

The story in an art film often has a secondary role to character development and exploration of ideas through lengthy sequences of dialogue. If an art film has a story, it is usually a drifting sequence of vaguely defined or ambiguous episodes. There may be unexplained gaps in the film, deliberately unclear sequences, or extraneous sequences that are not related to previous scenes, which force the viewer to subjectively make their own interpretation of the film&#x27;s message. Art films often &quot;bear the marks of a distinctive visual style&quot; and the authorial approach of the director. An art cinema film often refuses to provide a &quot;readily answered conclusion&quot;, instead putting to the cinema viewer the task of thinking about &quot;how is the story being told? Why tell the story in this way?&quot;

Bordwell claims that &quot;art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions&quot;. Film theorist Robert Stam also argues that &quot;art film&quot; is a film genre. He claims that a film is considered to be an art film based on artistic status in the same way film genres can be based on aspects of films such as their budgets (blockbuster films or B-movies) or their star performers (Adam Sandler films).

==Art film and film criticism==
There are scholars who point out that mass market films such as those produced in Hollywood appeal to a less discerning audience. This group then turns to film critics as a cultural elite that can help steer them towards films that are more thoughtful and of a higher quality. To bridge the disconnect between popular taste and high culture, these film critics are expected to explain unfamiliar concepts and make them appealing to cultivate a more discerning movie-going public. For example, a film critic can help the audience—through their reviews—think seriously about films by providing the terms of analysis of these art films. Adopting an artistic framework of film analysis and review, these film critics provide viewers with a different way to appreciate what they are watching. So when controversial themes are explored, the public will not immediately dismiss or attack the movie where they are informed by critics of the film&#x27;s value such as how it depicts realism. Here, art theaters or art houses that exhibit art films are seen as &quot;sites of cultural enlightenment&quot; that draw critics and intellectual audiences alike. It serves as a place where these critics can experience culture and an artistic atmosphere where they can draw insights and material.

==Timeline of notable films==
The following list is a small, partial sample of films with &quot;art film&quot; qualities, compiled to give a general sense of what directors and films are considered to have &quot;art film&quot; characteristics. The films in this list demonstrate one or more of the characteristics of art films: a serious, non-commercial, or independently made film that is not aimed at a mass audience. Some of the films on this list are also considered to be &quot;auteur&quot; films, independent films, or experimental films. In some cases, critics disagree over whether a film is mainstream or not. For example, while some critics called Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991) an &quot;exercise in film experimentation&quot; of &quot;high artistic quality&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it an ambitious mainstream film. Some films on this list have most of these characteristics; other films are commercially made films, produced by mainstream studios, that nevertheless bear the hallmarks of a director&#x27;s &quot;auteur&quot; style, or which have an experimental character. The films on this list are notable either because they won major awards or critical praise from influential film critics, or because they introduced an innovative narrative or film-making technique.

===1920s–1940s===

In the 1920s and 1930s, filmmakers did not set out to make &quot;art films&quot;, and film critics did not use the term &quot;art film&quot;. However, there were films that had sophisticated aesthetic objectives, such as Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928) and &quot;Vampyr&quot; (1932), surrealist films such as Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Un chien andalou&quot; (1929) and &quot;L&#x27;Âge d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930), or even films dealing with political and current-event relevance such as Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s famed and influential masterpiece &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. The U.S. film &quot;&quot; (1927) by German Expressionist director F. W. Murnau uses distorted art design and groundbreaking cinematography to create an exaggerated, fairy-tale-like world rich with symbolism and imagery. Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; (1939) is a comedy of manners that transcends the conventions of its genre by creating a biting and tragic satire of French upper-class society in the years before WWII; a poll of critics from &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; ranked it as the fourth greatest film ever, placing it behind &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;.

Some of these early, artistically oriented films were financed by wealthy individuals rather than film companies, particularly in cases where the content of the film was controversial or unlikely to attract an audience. In the late 1940s, UK director Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger made &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948), a film about ballet, which stood out from mainstream-genre films of the era. In 1945, David Lean directed &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, an adaptation of Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Still Life&quot;, which observes a passionate love affair between an upper-class man and a middle-class woman amidst the social and economic issues that Britain faced at the time.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, some of the well-known films with artistic sensibilities include &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), a film about a young woman who is forced to go to work for a cruel and inhumane circus performer to support her family, and eventually comes to terms with her situation; Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Ordet&quot; (1955), centering on a family with a lack of faith, but with a son who believes that he is Jesus Christ and convinced that he is capable of performing miracles; Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; (1957), which deals with a prostitute&#x27;s failed attempts to find love, her suffering and rejection; &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (1957), by Ingmar Bergman, whose narrative concerns an elderly medical doctor, who is also a professor, whose nightmares lead him to re-evaluate his life; and &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959) by François Truffaut, whose main character is a young man trying to come of age despite abuse from his parents, schoolteachers, and society, this film is the first big step in the French New Wave and for cinema, it showed that films can be made with little money, amateur actors, and a small crew. In Poland, the Khrushchev Thaw permitted some relaxation of the regime&#x27;s cultural policies, and productions such as &quot;A Generation&quot;, &quot;Kanal&quot;, &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Lotna&quot; (1954–1959), all directed by Andrzej Wajda, showed the Polish Film School style.

====Asia====
In India, there was an art-film movement in Bengali cinema known as &quot;Parallel Cinema&quot; or &quot;Indian New Wave&quot;. This was an alternative to the mainstream commercial cinema. It was known for its serious content, realism and naturalism, with a keen eye on the social-political climate of the times. This movement is distinct from mainstream commercial cinema and began around the same time as French and Japanese New Wave. The most influential filmmakers involved in this movement were Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak. Some of the most internationally acclaimed films made in the period were &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–1959), a trio of films that tell the story of a poor country boy&#x27;s growth to adulthood, and Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Distant Thunder&quot; (1973), which tells the story of a farmer during a famine in Bengal. Other acclaimed Bengali filmmakers involved in this movement include Rituparno Ghosh, Aparna Sen and Goutam Ghose.

Japanese filmmakers produced a number of films that broke with convention. Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), the first Japanese film to be widely screened in the West, depicts four witnesses&#x27; contradictory accounts of a rape and murder. In 1952, Kurosawa directed &quot;Ikiru&quot;, a film about a Tokyo bureaucrat struggling to find a meaning for his life. &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953), by Yasujirō Ozu, explores social changes of the era by telling the story of an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children, but find the children are too self-absorbed to spend much time with them. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), by Kurosawa, tells the story of a farming village that hires seven master-less samurais to combat bandits. &quot;Fires on the Plain&quot; (1959), by Kon Ichikawa, explores the Japanese experience in World War II by depicting a sick Japanese soldier struggling to stay alive. &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953), by Kenji Mizoguchi, is a ghost story set in the late 16th century, which tells the story of peasants whose village is in the path of an advancing army. A year later, Mizoguchi directed &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; (1954), which tells the story of two aristocratic children sold into slavery; in addition to dealing with serious themes such as the loss of freedom, the film features beautiful images and long, complicated shots.

===1960s===
The 1960s was an important period in art film, with the release of a number of groundbreaking films giving rise to the European art cinema. Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;À bout de souffle&quot; (&quot;Breathless&quot;) (1960) used innovative visual and editing techniques such as jump cuts and hand-held camera work. Godard, a leading figure of the French New Wave, would continue to make innovative films throughout the decade, proposing a whole new style of film-making. Following the success of &quot;Breathless&quot;, Godard made two more very influential films, &quot;Contempt&quot; in 1963, which it shown his view on studio filmmaking system, beautiful long take, and film within film, and &quot;Pierrot le fou&quot; in 1965, which it is a mash of mash of crime and romance films with and his anti Hollywood style. &quot;Jules et Jim&quot;, by François Truffaut, deconstructed a complex relationship of three individuals through innovative screenwriting, editing, and camera techniques. Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni helped revolutionize filmmaking with such films as &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; (1960), influential for its landscape photography and framing techniques, follows the disappearance of a young upper-class woman during a boating trip, and the subsequent search by her lover and her best friend; &quot;La Notte&quot; (1961), a complex examination of a failed marriage that dealt with issues such as anomie and sterility; &quot;Eclipse&quot; (1962), about a young woman who is unable to form a solid relationship with her boyfriend because of his materialistic nature; &quot;Red Desert&quot; (1964), his first colour film, which deals with the need to adapt to the modern world; and &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), his first English-language film, which examines issues of perception and reality as it follows a young photographer&#x27;s attempt to discover whether he had photographed a murder.

Swedish director Ingmar Bergman began the 1960s with chamber pieces such as &quot;Winter Light&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Silence&quot; (1963), which deal with such themes as emotional isolation and a lack of communication. His films from the second half of the decade, such as &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), &quot;Shame&quot; (1968), and &quot;A Passion&quot; (1969), deal with the idea of film as an artifice. The intellectual and visually expressive films of Tadeusz Konwicki, such as &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day&quot; (&quot;Zaduszki&quot;, 1961) and &quot;Salto&quot; (1962), inspired discussions about war and raised existential questions on behalf of their everyman protagonists.
Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) depicts a succession of nights and dawns in Rome as witnessed by a cynical journalist, this film is a bridge between his previous Italian neorealist style and his later surrealist style. In 1963, Fellini made &quot;8½&quot;, an exploration of creative, marital and spiritual difficulties, filmed in black-and-white by cinematographer Gianni di Venanzo. The 1961 film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; by director Alain Resnais examines perception and reality, using grand tracking shots that became widely influential. Robert Bresson&#x27;s &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; (1966) and &quot;Mouchette&quot; (1967) are notable for their naturalistic, elliptical style. Spanish director Luis Buñuel also contributed heavily to the art of film with shocking, surrealist satires such as &quot;Viridiana&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; (1962).

Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s film &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot; (1966) is a portrait of the medieval Russian icon painter of the same name. The film is also about artistic freedom and the possibility and necessity of making art for, and in the face of, a repressive authority. A cut version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize. At the end of the decade, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) wowed audiences with its scientific realism, pioneering use of special effects, and unusual visual imagery. In 1969, Andy Warhol released &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, the first adult art film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. According to Warhol, &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was a major influence in the making of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, an internationally controversial erotic art film, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and released a few years after &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was made. In Soviet Armenia, Sergei Parajanov&#x27;s &quot;The Color of Pomegranates&quot;, in which Georgian actress Sofiko Chiaureli plays five different characters, was banned by Soviet authorities, unavailable in the West for a long period, and praised by critic Mikhail Vartanov as &quot;revolutionary&quot;; and in the early 1980s, &quot;Les Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; placed the film in its top 10 list. In 1967, in Soviet Georgia, influential Georgian film director Tengiz Abuladze directed &quot;Vedreba&quot; (Entreaty), which was based on the motifs of Vaja-Pshavela&#x27;s literary works, where story is told in a poetic narrative style, full of symbolic scenes with philosophical meanings. In Iran, Dariush Mehrjui&#x27;s &quot;The Cow&quot; (1969), about a man who becomes insane after the death of his beloved cow, sparked the new wave of Iranian cinema.

Puppeteer Jim Henson had an arthouse success with his 1965 Oscar-nominated non-Muppet short &quot;Time Piece&quot;.

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, directors shocked audiences with violent films such as &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s brutal exploration of futuristic youth gangs, and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1972), Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s taboo-breaking, sexually-explicit and controversial film. At the same time, other directors made more introspective films, such as Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s meditative science fiction film &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972), supposedly intended as a Soviet riposte to &quot;2001&quot;. In 1975 and 1979 respectively, Tarkovsky directed two other films, which garnered critical acclaim overseas: &quot;Mirror&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot;. Terrence Malick, who directed &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973) and &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978), shared many traits with Tarkovsky, such as his long, lingering shots of natural beauty, evocative imagery, and poetic narrative style.

Another feature of 1970s art films was the return to prominence of bizarre characters and imagery; which abound in the tormented, obsessed title character in German New Wave director Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1973), and in cult films such as Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s psychedelic &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1973) about a thief and an alchemist seeking the mythical Lotus Island. The film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), by Martin Scorsese, continues the themes that &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; explored: an alienated population living in a violent, decaying society. The gritty violence and seething rage of Scorsese&#x27;s film contrasts other films released in the same period, such as David Lynch&#x27;s dreamlike, surreal and industrial black and white classic &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977). In 1974, John Cassavetes offered a sharp commentary on American blue-collar life in &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot;, which features an eccentric housewife slowly descending into madness.

Also in the 1970s, Radley Metzger directed several adult art films, such as &quot;Barbara Broadcast&quot; (1977), which presented a surrealistic &quot;Buñellian&quot; atmosphere, and &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; (1976), based on the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;), which was considered, according to award-winning author Toni Bentley, to be the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Golden Age of Porn, an era in modern American culture that was inaugurated by the release of Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Blue Movie&quot; (1969) and featured the phenomenon of &quot;porno chic&quot; in which adult erotic films began to obtain wide release, were publicly discussed by celebrities (such as Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (such as Roger Ebert).

===1980s===
In 1980, director Martin Scorsese gave audiences, who had become used to the escapist blockbuster adventures of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, the gritty, harsh realism of his film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. In this film, actor Robert De Niro took method acting to an extreme to portray a boxer&#x27;s decline from a prizewinning young fighter to an overweight, &quot;has-been&quot; nightclub owner. Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) could also be seen as a science fiction art film, along with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). &quot;Blade Runner&quot; explores themes of existentialism, or what it means to be human. A box-office failure, the film became popular on the arthouse circuit as a cult oddity after the release of a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; became successful via VHS home video. In the middle of the decade, Japanese director Akira Kurosawa used realism to portray the brutal, bloody violence of Japanese samurai warfare of the 16th century in &quot;Ran&quot; (1985). &quot;Ran&quot; followed the plot of &quot;King Lear&quot;, in which an elderly king is betrayed by his children. Sergio Leone also contrasted brutal violence with emotional substance in his epic tale of mobster life in &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;.
Other directors in the 1980s chose a more intellectual path, exploring philosophical and ethical issues like Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s &quot;Man of Iron&quot; (1981), a critique of the Polish communist government, which won the 1981 Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Another Polish director, Krzysztof Kieślowski, made &quot;The Decalogue&quot; for television in 1988, a film series that explores ethical issues and moral puzzles. Two of these films were released theatrically as &quot;A Short Film About Love&quot; and &quot;A Short Film About Killing&quot;. In 1989, Woody Allen made, in the words of &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby, his most &quot;securely serious and funny film to date&quot;, &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, which involves multiple stories of people who are trying to find moral and spiritual simplicity while facing dire issues and thoughts surrounding the choices they make. French director Louis Malle chose another moral path to explore with the dramatization of his real-life childhood experiences in &quot;Au revoir les enfants&quot;, which depicts the occupying Nazi government&#x27;s deportation of French Jews to concentration camps during World War II.

Another critically praised art film from this era, Wim Wenders&#x27;s road movie &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984), also won the Palme d&#x27;Or.

Kieślowski was not the only director to transcend the distinction between the cinema and television. Ingmar Bergman made &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1982), which was shown on television in an extended five-hour version. In the United Kingdom, Channel 4, a new television channel, financed, in whole or in part, many films released theatrically through its Film 4 subsidiary. Wim Wenders offered another approach to life from a spiritual standpoint in his 1987 film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, a depiction of a &quot;fallen angel&quot; who lives among men, which won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 1982, experimental director Godfrey Reggio released the surprise arthouse hit &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;; a film without dialogue, which emphasizes cinematography (consisting primarily of slow motion and time-lapse cinematography of cities and natural landscapes, which results in a visual tone poem) and philosophical ideology about technology and the environment.

Another approach used by directors in the 1980s was to create bizarre, surreal alternative worlds. Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985) is a comedy-thriller that depicts a man&#x27;s baffling adventures in a surreal nighttime world of chance encounters with mysterious characters. David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), a film noir-style thriller-mystery filled with symbolism and metaphors about polarized worlds and inhabited by distorted characters who are hidden in the seamy underworld of a small town, became surprisingly successful considering its highly disturbing subject matter. Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989) is a fantasy/black comedy about cannibalism and extreme violence with an intellectual theme: a critique of &quot;elite culture&quot; in Thatcherian Britain.

According to Raphaël Bassan, in his article &quot;&quot;The Angel&quot;: Un météore dans le ciel de l&#x27;animation&quot;, Patrick Bokanowski&#x27;s &quot;The Angel&quot;, shown at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, can be considered the beginning of contemporary animation. The characters&#x27; masks erase all human personality and give the impression of total control over the &quot;matter&quot; of the image and its optical composition, using distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses, and synthetic objects.

In 1989, Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s &quot;A City of Sadness&quot; became the first Taiwanese film awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. The film shows the history of Taiwan through one family, and marks another step of the Taiwanese New Wave, which tends to depict realistic, down-to-earth life in both urban and rural Taiwan.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, directors took inspiration from the success of David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) and Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989) and created films with bizarre alternative worlds and elements of surrealism. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Dreams&quot; (1990) depicted his imaginative reveries in a series of vignettes that range from idyllic pastoral country landscapes to horrific visions of tormented demons and a blighted post-nuclear war landscape. The Coen Brothers&#x27; &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, features various literary allusions in an enigmatic story about a writer who encounters a range of bizarre characters, including an alcoholic, abusive novelist and a serial killer. &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), from the same director as &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, is a psychological thriller that explores fantasy worlds, bizarre time-space transformations, and mental breakdowns using surreal imagery.

Other directors in the 1990s explored philosophical issues and themes such as identity, chance, death, and existentialism. Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991) and Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994) explored the theme of identity. The former is an independent road movie/buddy film about two young street hustlers, which explores the theme of the search for home and identity. It was called a &quot;high-water mark in &#x27;90s independent film&quot;, a &quot;stark, poetic rumination&quot;, and an &quot;exercise in film experimentation&quot; of &quot;high artistic quality&quot;. &quot;Chungking Express&quot; explores themes of identity, disconnection, loneliness, and isolation in the &quot;metaphoric concrete jungle&quot; of modern Hong Kong. Todd Haynes explored the life of a suburban housewife and her eventual death from toxic materials in the 1995 critical success, &quot;Safe&quot;.

In 1991, another important film of Edward Yang, a Taiwanese New Wave director, &quot;A Brighter Summer Day&quot; is portrayal of one normal teenager life that evacuated from China to Taiwan which affacted by political situation, school situation, and family situation that make a main protagonist murders a girl in the end. In 1992, &quot;Rebels of the Neon God&quot;, first feature film of Tsai Ming-liang, second generation of Taiwanese New Wave, it has his unique style of filmmaking like alienation, slow movement of actor (his recurring cast, Lee Kang-sheng), slow-paced, and a few dialogues.

Daryush Shokof&#x27;s film &quot;Seven Servants&quot; (1996) is an original high art cinema piece about a man who strives to &quot;unite&quot; the world&#x27;s races until his last breath. One year after &quot;Seven Servants&quot;, Abbas Kiarostami&#x27;s film &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; (1997), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, tells a similar tale with a different twist; both films are about a man trying to hire a person to bury him after he commits suicide. &quot;Seven Servants&quot; was shot in a minimalist style, with long takes, a leisurely pace, and long periods of silence. The film is also notable for its use of long shots and overhead shots to create a sense of distance between the audience and the characters. Zhang Yimou&#x27;s early 1990s works such as &quot;Ju Dou&quot; (1990), &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; (1991), &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot; (1992) and &quot;To Live&quot; (1994) explore human emotions through poignant narratives. &quot;To Live&quot; won the Grand Jury Prize.

Several 1990s films explored existentialist-oriented themes related to life, chance, and death. Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993) explores themes of chance, death, and infidelity by tracing 10 parallel and interwoven stories. The film, which won the Golden Lion and the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival, was called a &quot;many-sided, many mooded, dazzlingly structured eclectic jazz mural&quot; by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Michael Wilmington. Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;The Double Life of Véronique&quot; (1991) is a drama about the theme of identity and a political allegory about the East/West split in Europe; the film features stylised cinematography, an ethereal atmosphere, and unexplained supernatural elements.
Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s film &quot;Pi&quot; (1998) is an &quot;incredibly complex and ambiguous film filled with both incredible style and substance&quot; about a paranoid mathematician&#x27;s &quot;search for peace&quot;. The film creates a David Lynch-inspired &quot;eerie &quot;Eraserhead&quot;-like world&quot; shot in &quot;black-and-white, which lends a dream-like atmosphere to all of the proceedings&quot; and explores issues such as &quot;metaphysics and spirituality&quot;. Matthew Barney&#x27;s &quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot; (1994–2002) is a cycle of five symbolic, allegorical films that creates a self-enclosed aesthetic system, aimed to explore the process of creation. The films are filled with allusions to reproductive organs and sexual development, and use narrative models drawn from biography, mythology, and geology.

In 1997, Terrence Malick returned from a 20-year absence with &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, a war film that uses poetry and nature to stand apart from typical war movies. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.

Some 1990s films mix an ethereal or surreal visual atmosphere with the exploration of philosophical issues. &quot;Sátántangó&quot; (1994), by the Hungarian director Béla Tarr, is a -hour-long film, shot in black and white, that deals with Tarr&#x27;s favorite theme, inadequacy, as con man Irimias comes back to a village at an unspecified location in Hungary, presenting himself as a leader and Messiah figure to the gullible villagers. Kieslowski&#x27;s &quot;Three Colors&quot; trilogy (1993–94), particularly &quot;Blue&quot; (1993) and &quot;Red&quot; (1994), deal with human relationships and how people cope with them in their day-to-day lives. The trilogy of films was called &quot;explorations of spirituality and existentialism&quot; that created a &quot;truly transcendent experience&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996) as one of its top 25 arthouse films. The reviewer stated that &quot;[a]ll the ingredients that have come to define Lars von Trier&#x27;s career (and in turn, much of modern European cinema) are present here: high-wire acting, innovative visual techniques, a suffering heroine, issue-grappling drama, and a galvanising shot of controversy to make the whole thing unmissable&quot;.

===2000s===
Lewis Beale of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; stated that Australian director Andrew Dominik&#x27;s western film &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; (2007) is &quot;a fascinating, literary-based work that succeeds as both art and genre film&quot;. Unlike the action-oriented Jesse James films of the past, Dominik&#x27;s unconventional epic perhaps more accurately details the outlaw&#x27;s relinquishing psyche during the final months of his life as he succumbs to the paranoia of being captured and develops a precarious friendship with his eventual assassin, Robert Ford.

In 2009, director Paul Thomas Anderson claimed that his 2002 film &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; about a shy, repressed rage-aholic was &quot;an art house Adam Sandler film&quot;, a reference to the unlikely inclusion of &quot;frat boy&quot; comic Sandler in the film; critic Roger Ebert claims that &quot;Punch Drunk Love&quot; &quot;may be the key to all of the Adam Sandler films, and may liberate Sandler for a new direction in his work. He can&#x27;t go on making those moronic comedies forever, can he? Who would have guessed he had such uncharted depths?&quot;

===2010s===
Apichatpong Weerasethakul&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot;, which won the 2010 Cannes Palme d&#x27;Or, &quot;ties together what might just be a series of beautifully shot scenes with moving and funny musings on the nature of death and reincarnation, love, loss, and karma&quot;. Weerasethakul is an independent film director, screenwriter, and film producer, who works outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system. His films deal with dreams, nature, sexuality, including his own homosexuality, and Western perceptions of Thailand and Asia. Weerasethakul&#x27;s films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures (such as placing titles/credits at the middle of a film) and for working with non-actors.

Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2011) was released after decades of development and won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival; it was highly praised by critics. At the Avon Theater in Stamford, Connecticut, a message was posted about the theater&#x27;s no-refund policy due to &quot;some customer feedback and a polarized audience response&quot; to the film. The theater stated that it &quot;stands behind this ambitious work of art and other challenging films&quot;. &quot;Drive&quot; (2011), directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, is commonly called an arthouse action film. Also in 2011, director Lars von Trier released &quot;Melancholia&quot;, a movie dealing with depression and other mental disorders while also showing a family&#x27;s reaction to an approaching planet that could collide with the Earth. The movie was well received, some claiming it to be Von Trier&#x27;s masterpiece with others highlighting Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s performance, the visuals, and realism depicted in the movie.

Jonathan Glazer&#x27;s &quot;Under the Skin&quot; (an example of &quot;arthouse sci-fi&quot;) was screened at the 2013 Venice Film Festival and received a theatrical release through indie studio A24 the following year. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson, follows an alien in human form as she travels around Glasgow, picking up unwary men for sex, harvesting their flesh and stripping them of their humanity. Dealing with themes such as sexuality, humanity, and objectification, the film received positive reviews and was hailed by some as a masterpiece; critic Richard Roeper described the film as &quot;what we talk about when we talk about film as art&quot;.

This decade also saw a re-emergence of &quot;art horror&quot; with the success of films like &quot;Beyond the Black Rainbow&quot; (2010), &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), &quot;Stoker&quot; (2013), &quot;Enemy&quot; (2013), &quot;The Babadook&quot; (2014), &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot; (2014), &quot;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&quot; (2014), &quot;Goodnight Mommy&quot; (2014), &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; (2014), &quot;It Follows&quot; (2015), &quot;The Witch&quot; (2015), &quot;The Wailing&quot; (2016), &quot;Split&quot; (2016), the social thriller &quot;Get Out&quot; (2017), &quot;Mother!&quot; (2017), &quot;Annihilation&quot; (2018), &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; (2018), &quot;Hereditary&quot; (2018), &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018; a remake of the 1977 film of the same name), &quot;Mandy&quot; (2018), &quot;The Nightingale&quot; (2018), &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; (2018), &quot;Us&quot; (2019), &quot;Midsommar&quot; (2019), &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (2019), &quot;Color Out of Space&quot; (2019) and the Academy Award for Best Picture winner &quot;Parasite&quot; (2019).

&quot;Roma&quot; (2018), is a film by Alfonso Cuarón inspired by his childhood living in 1970s Mexico. Shot in black-and-white, it deals with themes shared with Cuarón&#x27;s past films, such as mortality and class. The film was distributed through Netflix, earning the streaming giant their first Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.

Arthouse animation (with Oscar-nominated titles like &quot;Song of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Loving Vincent&quot;) was also gaining momentum during this era as an alternative to mainstream animated features alongside the works of acclaimed animators Satoshi Kon, Don Hertzfeldt and Ari Folman from the previous decade.

Tom Shone said of the work of Christopher Nolan: &quot;He has completed eleven features, [...] all ticking the boxes of studio entertainment, yet indelibly marked with the kind of personal themes and obsessions that are more traditionally the preserve of the art house: the passage of time, the failures of memory, our quirks of denial and deflection, the intimate clockwork of our interior lives, set against landscapes in which the fault lines of late industrialism meet the fissure points and paradoxes of the information age.&quot;

==Criticism==
Criticisms of art films include being too pretentious and self-indulgent for mainstream audiences.

&quot;LA Weekly&quot; film critic Michael Nordine cited the films &quot;Gummo&quot; (1997) as being an &quot;art-house exploitation flick&quot; and &quot;Amores Perros&quot; (2000) exemplifying &quot;the art-house stereotype of featuring more dead dogs than &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot; and every other book you had to read in middle school&quot;.

==Related concepts==
===Arthouse television===

Quality artistic television, a television genre or style which shares some of the same traits as art films, has been identified. Television shows, such as David Lynch and Mark Frost&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;, also have &quot;a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity&quot;.

As with much of Lynch&#x27;s other work (notably the film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;), &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; explores the gulf between the veneer of small-town respectability and the seedier layers of life lurking beneath its surface. The show is difficult to place in a defined television genre; stylistically, it borrows the unsettling tone and supernatural premises of horror films and simultaneously offers a bizarrely comical parody of American soap operas with a campy, melodramatic presentation of the morally dubious activities of its quirky characters. The show represents an earnest moral inquiry distinguished by both weird humor and a deep vein of surrealism, incorporating highly stylised vignettes, surrealist and often inaccessible artistic images alongside the otherwise comprehensible narrative of events.

HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; might also qualify as &quot;artistic television&quot;, as it has garnered a greater amount of critical attention from academics than most television shows receive. For example, the film theory journal &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; has featured the show on its cover.

==In popular media==
Art films have been part of popular culture from animated sitcoms like &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Clone High&quot; spoofing and satirizing them to even the comedic film review webseries &quot;Brows Held High&quot; (hosted by Kyle Kallgren).

<text>John Gibson Clarkson (July 1, 1861 – February 4, 1909) was an American Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He played from 1882 to 1894. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Clarkson played for the Worcester Ruby Legs (1882), Chicago White Stockings (1884–1887), Boston Beaneaters (1888–1892), and Cleveland Spiders (1892–1894). Clarkson pitched the first known immaculate inning in MLB history on June 4, 1889 vs the Philadelphia Quakers in the 3rd inning.

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963.

==Career overview==
Clarkson compiled a career 328–178 record, placing him twelfth on the MLB list of all-time wins. Clarkson pitched over 600 innings in a season twice and won a career-high 53 games in 1885. In MLB history, only Charles Radbourn has won more games in a single season (59 in 1884). In just five seasons from 1885 to 1889, Clarkson won 209 games.

Clarkson had a wide variety of curve balls and was considered to be a calculating, scientific pitcher who carefully analyzed every hitter&#x27;s weaknesses. Hall of Fame hitter Sam Thompson said of Clarkson: &quot;I faced him in scores of games and I can truthfully say that never in all that time did I get a pitch that came where I expected it or in the way in which I guessed it was coming.&quot;

At the time Clarkson retired from the game, he was the winningest pitcher in National League history.

Aside from being a great pitcher, Clarkson was also a fair hitter. His 24 career home runs ranks 7th on the List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers. He also had 232 career RBIs and 254 runs scored.

Total Baseball ranked Clarkson as the fourth best pitcher of all time behind Hall of Famers Cy Young, Christy Mathewson and Lefty Grove, though Bill James ranks him lower at number 42 in his &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;.

Clarkson&#x27;s election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 was by the Veterans Committee.

==Early years==
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Clarkson was one of five sons of a prosperous jeweler. Clarkson had two brothers who were also major league pitchers: Dad Clarkson and Walter Clarkson. The three Clarkson brothers rank third in wins by brothers behind the Niekro and Perry brothers. Another brother, T. Henry Clarkson, was a golf and billiards player. The Clarkson&#x27;s also had two maternal cousins, Walter Hackett and Mortimer &quot;Mert&quot; Hackett who played professional baseball.

After attending business school and playing semipro ball, Clarkson signed as a free agent with Worcester of the National League in 1882. Clarkson played his first major league game at age 20 on May 2, 1882. He played in three games for the Ruby Legs, finishing with a 1–2 record in 24 innings. The Worcester team folded after the 1882 season, and Clarkson pitched in the minors the following two years.

==Chicago White Stockings (1884–1887)==
Chicago manager Cap Anson saw Clarkson pitching for Saginaw in the Northwest League in 1884. On August 24, 1884, the White Stockings purchased him from Saginaw.

The White Stockings finished in fifth place in 1884, but Clarkson put in a strong performance, going 10–3 in 13 starts after being acquired from Saginaw. His .769 win percentage was the second best in the league, and his 2.14 ERA was sixth best.

Clarkson was known to be extremely sensitive to criticism. Shortly after his death in 1909, former Chicago player/manager Cap Anson noted that &quot;not many know what amount of encouragement it took to keep him going.&quot; Anson recalled: &quot;Scold him, find fault with him, and he would not pitch at all. Say to him after a game: &#x27;Grand work, John, I will probably use you again tomorrow, for we&#x27;ve got to have that game,&#x27; and he would go out the next day and stand all batters on their heads.&#x27;&quot; Alfred H. Spink, &quot;The National Game&quot; (1910), &quot;quoted in&quot; Bill James, &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot; (2001), p. 873.

===A 53-win season in 1885===
In 1885, Clarkson became Chicago&#x27;s principal starting pitcher. In a remarkable feat of durability, Clarkson appeared in 70 games that year, pitched 623 innings and threw 68 complete games. He also won 53 games with an ERA of 1.85 (Adjusted ERA+ of 165).

On July 27, 1885, he pitched the only no-hitter of his career with a 4–0 win over the Providence Grays.

His 50th win of the season occurred on September 19, 1885, a 10–3 victory over Boston.

The White Stockings won the 1885 National League pennant with 83 wins, 53 of which came from Clarkson. Clarkson started three games in the 1885 World Series against the St. Louis Browns, with a record of 1–1 and an ERA of 1.12, allowing only two earned runs in 16 innings.

Clarkson&#x27;s performance in 1885 led the National League in wins (53) and strikeouts (308) and ranks as one of the most remarkable in major league history.
* His 53 wins is the second highest single season total in MLB history.
* His 68 complete games is the seventh highest single season total in MLB history.
* His 70 games started is the eighth most in MLB history.
* His 632 innings pitched is the eighth most in MLB history.

===A 36-win season in 1886===
In 1886, Clarkson shared the pitching load with Jim McCormick and Jocko Flynn, each of whom won at least 23 games and pitched over 250 innings. Clarkson had a record of 36–17, with 50 complete games and an ERA of 2.41 (Adjusted ERA+ of 150) in innings pitched. He also led the league with a career-high 313 strikeouts. On August 8, 1886, Clarkson struck out a team-record 16 batters against Kansas City.

The 1886 White Stockings finished with a record of 90–34 with a winning percentage of .726 that ranks as one of the highest in baseball history. After winning the National League pennant by games over the Detroit Wolverines, the White Stockings faced the St. Louis Browns in the World Series for the second consecutive year.

Clarkson pitched four games (three of which were complete games) in the 1886 World Series. He had a record of 2–2 with 28 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.04 in 31 innings pitched.

The sixth game, at St. Louis, was considered one of the greatest games ever played to that time. With the Browns ahead three games to two, Anson called on Clarkson to start his fourth game in six days. Clarkson responded with seven shutout innings, but gave up three runs in the eighth inning, and the game went to extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, the Browns&#x27; center fielder Curt Welch singled (only the fourth hit off Clarkson) and moved to third on a sacrifice. Welch and Browns’ third base coach Arlie Latham tried to distract Clarkson with heckling and faking moves toward home. When Welch finally attempted the steal, Chicago&#x27;s catcher, King Kelly, had called for a pitchout, but Clarkson threw a wild pitch, and Welch scored the World Series winning run.

===A 38-win season in 1887===
In 1887, Clarkson was 38–21 for Chicago with 56 complete games and a 3.08 ERA. However, King Kelly was sold to Boston before the season began, and the team began a decline, dropping to third place in 1887. Clarkson, always a touchy temperament, reportedly became more difficult to handle after Kelly&#x27;s departure.

==Boston Beaneaters (1888–1892)==
On April 3, 1888, the White Stockings sold Clarkson to the Boston Beaneaters for $10,000—a huge sum at the time. Clarkson followed teammate King Kelly, who had been sold from Chicago to Boston the previous year at the same price. The two became known as the &quot;$20,000 Battery.&quot;

Clarkson pitched five seasons for Boston. He was 33–20 in 1888, starting 54 games and pitching 53 complete games with an ERA of 2.76.

===A 49-win season in 1889===
The 1889 season was Clarkson&#x27;s best for Boston. He started a career-high 72 games and had an astounding record of 49–19 with 68 complete games, 284 strikeouts, and a 2.73 ERA in 620 innings pitched.

While Clarkson&#x27;s 1889 numbers are comparable to those he posted in 1885, the game and distance to the plate had changed, and no other pitcher pitched nearly as many games or innings as Clarkson in 1889. As a measure of his dominance, Clarkson&#x27;s 49 wins were 11 more than any other pitcher; his 620 innings were 200 more than any other pitcher; and his 68 complete games were 22 more than any other pitcher. He also had twice as many shutouts as the next best pitcher. He was only the fourth pitcher to win the pitching Triple Crown, by leading the National League in wins, ERA and strikeouts.

On June 4, 1889, Clarkson became the first pitcher in major league history to throw an immaculate inning, striking out all three batters on a total of nine pitches in the third inning of a 4–2 win over the Philadelphia Quakers.

===Later years in Boston===
Clarkson became involved in the players&#x27; rebellion in 1890, but then opted to remain with the Beaneaters.

In 1891, Clarkson helped lead the Beaneaters to the National League pennant. Clarkson led the team with a 33–19 record, 47 complete games, and innings pitched.

During a game that carried into the dusk hours, Clarkson once pitched a lemon to the plate to persuade the umpire, Jack Kerins to call the game due to darkness. Kerins called the lemon a strike, and when shown by Boston&#x27;s catcher that he had called a lemon a strike, Kerins finally called the game.

==Cleveland Spiders (1892–1893)==
On June 30, 1892, after 16 starts and an 8–6 record, Clarkson was released by Boston&#x27;s new manager, Frank Selee. He was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Spiders. Clarkson went 17–10 for the remainder of the 1892 season, for a season record of 25–16. (The Spiders’ pitching staff included Cy Young, who won 36 games in 1892 and 34 games in 1893.)

In 1893, Clarkson had the first losing record of his career, finishing 16–17 with a career-high ERA of 4.45.

After the 1893 season, Clarkson went on a hunting trip with his close friend Charlie Bennett, who had been his catcher from 1888 to 1890. Bennett got off the train in Wellsville, Kansas and when he tried to reboard, Bennett slipped and fell under the train&#x27;s wheels. Bennett lost both of his legs in the accident. Clarkson witnessed the incident, and it was said to have severely affected his already unstable nature.

In 1894, his final year in the major leagues, Clarkson went 8–10 in 18 starts for the Spiders. He played his last major league game on July 12, 1894.

==Life after baseball==
After his baseball career ended, Clarkson moved to Bay City, Michigan and ran a cigar store there until 1906.

In either 1905 or 1906, Clarkson suffered a breakdown, was declared insane, and was committed to an insane asylum. Clarkson spent much of the next three years in mental hospitals.

During a visit with family in 1909, Clarkson fell seriously ill, and was admitted to the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, a well-known psychiatric clinic. He died there, of pneumonia, February 4, 1909, aged 47.

==History==
According to documents and historical sources, the first medieval urban settlements and towns around the Una river, began to appear in the middle of the 13th century. Bihać, as the centre of Pounje, was first mentioned on 26 February 1260, in the charter of Hungarian King Bela IV, and was described as a town built on the river&#x27;s Island of St. Ladislav, owned by the Benedictine abbey of Topusko. Just two years later, in 1262, Bela proclaimed Bihać a &quot;royal free city&quot; and placed it under the direct authority of the Hungarian throne, with all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, which ensured its ability to develop completely independent from the political powers of local lords.
The following mention in the charter of 1271 confirms that Bihać at that time enjoyed the status of a &quot;free city&quot;. At the head of the municipality was the town elder or &quot;major villae&quot;, who was often called a judge, and whose decision could only be changed by the king. Bihać also had a &quot;curia&quot; or &quot;magistrates&quot;, an assembly of local citizens who took the oath of office for this duty, and notaries who kept court and other civil records.

In 1530 Austria sent troops to defend seven key strongholds in Croatia, one of them was Bihać and another the nearby Ripač. The Ottomans occupied Bihać in 1592 after a siege and from that time Bihać was the most important forts in Bosnia until the 19th century. Ottoman rule was briefly interrupted by Auguste Marmont, general-governor of Illyrian Provinces on 5 May 1810. He sought to prevent Ottomans from raiding French Croatia and finishing the Ottoman occupation of Cetin. After fulfilling these goals, he withdrew from Bihac. Ottoman rule in Bihac ended &quot;de facto&quot; after the Congress of Berlin.

During World War II, the town was occupied by Axis troops and was included into the Pavelić&#x27;s Independent State of Croatia (NDH). The fascist Ustashe regime committed the Genocide of the Serbs and the Holocaust. From July to September 1941, some 15,000 Serbs were massacred along with some Jews and Roma victims at the Garavice, an extermination location near Bihać. The town was the capital of a short-lived territory, the Bihać Republic, for two months in late 1942 and early 1943, until it was recaptured by German forces. From 1943 Judita Alargić served near to Bihać as an instructor of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Bihać returned to Bosnian territory on 28 March 1945. 

Bihać was besieged for three years from 1992 to 1995 during the Bosnian War.

<text>The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is an American think tank based in Washington, D.C. From its founding in 1962 until 1987, it was an affiliate of Georgetown University, initially named the Center for Strategic and International Studies of Georgetown University. The center conducts policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world, with a focus on issues concerning international relations, trade, technology, finance, energy and geostrategy.

Since its founding, CSIS &quot;has been dedicated to finding ways to sustain American prominence and prosperity as a force for good in the world&quot;, according to its website. CSIS is officially a bipartisan think tank with scholars that represent varying points of view across the political spectrum. It is known for inviting well-known foreign policy and public service officials from the U.S. Congress and the executive branch, including those affiliated with either the Democratic or the Republican Party as well as foreign officials of varying political backgrounds. It has been labeled a &quot;centrist&quot; think tank by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

The center hosts the Statesmen&#x27;s Forum, a bipartisan venue for international leaders to present their views. Past speakers have included United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and National Security Advisor Tom Donilon. The center also conducts the CSIS-Schieffer School Dialogues, a series of multiple discussions hosted by Bob Schieffer of CBS News, and the Global Security Forum, which has featured keynote addresses by Defense Department officials, including former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.

==History==
===1960s===
The center was founded in 1962 by Arleigh Burke and David Manker Abshire. It originally was part of Georgetown University. It officially opened its doors on September 4, shortly before the Cuban Missile Crisis. The original office was located one block away from Georgetown&#x27;s campus in a small brick townhouse located at 1316 36th Street. The first professional staff member hired was Richard V. Allen who later served in the Reagan administration.

At a conference held in the Hall of Nations at Georgetown University in January 1963, the center developed its blueprint for its intellectual agenda. The book that emerged from the conference, &quot;National Security: Political, Military and Economic Strategies in the Decade Ahead&quot;, was more than one thousand pages long. The book set out a framework for discussing national security and defined areas of agreement and disagreement within the Washington foreign policy community during the Cold War. The book argued for a strategic perspective on global affairs and also defined a school of thought within international relations studies for that period. The practitioners of this school of thought subsequently made their way to the pinnacles of U.S. policymaking, particularly during the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations.

===1970s===
By the mid to late 1970s, many scholars who worked at the center had found their way to senior positions in government in the Department of State or Department of Defense. When Henry Kissinger retired from his position as U.S. Secretary of State in 1977, Harvard University declined to offer him a professorship. He decided to teach part-time at Georgetown University&#x27;s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and to make CSIS the base for his Washington operations, over offers to teach at Yale, Penn, Columbia, and Oxford. Kissinger&#x27;s decision to become affiliated with the Washington-based institution attracted more public attention for the center than virtually any event in the preceding fifteen years.

Following Kissinger&#x27;s involvement, other cabinet-level officials, including James Schlesinger, Bill Brock, William J. Crowe, and Harold Brown, joined CSIS in the late 1970s. When Zbigniew Brzezinski joined the center in 1981 after the end of the Carter administration, he worked on issues related to the Soviet Union and Poland&#x27;s transition to a market economy. The arrangements for these senior government officials allowed them to write, lecture, and consult with media and business firms, and are typical of the way CSIS can incorporate high-level policymakers when they leave government. During the 1970s and 1980s, a myriad of think tanks either expanded operations or emerged in Washington, D.C., representing a range of ideological positions and specialized policy interests.

===1980s===
In 1986, several Georgetown University professors criticized CSIS staff members for giving academically unsupported assessments of foreign policy issues during public interviews. Donations to Georgetown University decreased because of its association with CSIS. A special committee studied the friction, and its report stated that CSIS was more focused on the media than to scholarly research and recommended that CSIS be formally separated from Georgetown University. On October, 17, 1986, Georgetown University&#x27;s board of directors voted to sever all ties with CSIS.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies was incorporated in Washington, D.C. on December 29, 1986, and the formal affiliation between Georgetown and CSIS ended on July 1, 1987.

===1990s===
The center became an incorporated nonprofit organization to raise its endowment and expand its programs to focus on emerging regions of the world. The work of the trustees and counselors with the center after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1980s left CSIS in a unique position to develop the nation&#x27;s foreign policy with the United States as the world&#x27;s sole superpower. It signified a degree of institutional maturation and prestige that the founders had not imagined when they founded the center in the early 1960s.

After the end of the Cold War, there emerged a suspicion in Washington that the United States was not as well equipped as it ought to be to compete in the international economy. This outlook drove CSIS to set up a project in early 1990 that, to some, seemed removed from traditional strategic and international concerns. The idea that America should focus on its problems at home to strengthen its role abroad evolved into the Commission on the Strengthening of America, chaired by Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Pete Domenici.

David Abshire saw the commission as a way to examine and improve upon economic policy, coming to the conclusion that the White House should reorganize the Executive Office of the President to include a National Economic Council with a national economic adviser on the model of the National Security Council. This new focus on economic policy led CSIS to increase its research focus on international economics and issues concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank as well as global health and the environmental and societal effects of climate change. These issues merged into CSIS&#x27;s mission to complement its traditional focus on international security issues. Up to the present day, CSIS has been dedicated to finding ways to sustain American prominence and prosperity as a force for good in the world, according to the CSIS website.

===21st century===
In 2013, CSIS moved from its K Street headquarters to a new location on Rhode Island Avenue in Washington, D.C. The new building cost $100 million to build and has a studio for media interviews and room to host conferences, events, lectures and discussions. The building is located in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Dupont Circle neighborhood and will earn LEED Platinum Certification.

In 2015, H. Andrew Schwartz, a senior vice president at CSIS, was quoted describing the organization&#x27;s &quot;number one goal&quot; as &quot;hav[ing] impact on policy.&quot; Defending the organization from claims that it had inappropriately engaged in lobbying on behalf of U.S. defense contractors, CEO John Hamre was quoted in 2016 as saying, &quot;We strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country&#x27;s most difficult problems... We gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement.&quot;

In 2024, the Center was designated as an &quot;undesirable organization&quot; in Russia.

==Funding==
For fiscal year 2013, CSIS had an operating revenue of US$32.3 million. The sources were 32% corporate, 29% foundation, 19% government, 9% individuals, 5% endowment, and 6% other. CSIS had operating expenses of $32.2 million for 2013—78% for programs, 16% for administration, and 6% for development.

In September 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the United Arab Emirates had donated a sum greater than $1 million to the organization. Additionally, CSIS has received an undisclosed amount of funding from Japan through the government-funded Japan External Trade Organization, as well as from Norway. After being contacted by the &quot;Times&quot;, CSIS released a list of foreign state donors, listing 13 governments including those of Germany and China. The Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS lists major funding from defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon Company and General Atomics.

Significant funding has come from the governments of the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates.

==Programs and events==

CSIS undertakes numerous programs and projects each with its own unique missions and interests. The Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group, for instance, provides research into the defense industry on behalf of government and corporate customers. The Global Health Policy Center focuses on U.S. engagements in HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and other high priorities, especially their intersection with U.S. national security interests. 

CSIS has often provided a platform for high-profile figures to make important statements about international relations issues. For example, in September 2019, former National Security Advisor John Bolton delivered his first speech since leaving office at CSIS, and used the opportunity to be highly critical of US policy towards North Korea.

In 2012, CSIS hosted U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she delivered a keynote address on &quot;U.S. Strategic Engagement with North Africa in an Era of Change,&quot; that addressed the security of embassies in the wake of the 2012 Benghazi attack.

CSIS hosts more than 350 students and professionals every year for variety of seminars and programming. CSIS also offers a master program in international relations in collaboration with the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.

===Project on Nuclear Issues===
The Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) is a program hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) to advance the public debate about the future role nuclear technology will play on the world stage. Created in 2003 with support from a few government agencies and private donations, PONI has two stated goals. First, it seeks to &quot;build and sustain a networked community of young nuclear experts from the military, the national laboratories, industry, academia, and the policy community.&quot; Second, &quot;[work] to contribute to the debate and leadership on nuclear issues by generating new ideas and discussions among both its members and the public-at-large.&quot;

Regarding its philosophy, the PONI public website states:

&quot;Perhaps the most critical challenge in sustaining the US nuclear deterrent after the end of the Cold War is maintaining the human infrastructure necessary to support US nuclear capabilities. This is especially true as the human infrastructure necessary to support a nuclear stockpile at the envisioned level of 1700-2200 operational warheads is not appreciably smaller than that necessary to support one at current levels. The challenge is therefore to maintain a smaller, but still vibrant, community of nuclear experts.&quot;
Clark A. Murdock started PONI when it was widely recognized that the nuclear community faced an impending crisis. With the widespread and rapid retirement of nuclear scientists and experts from the national laboratories, private industry, and the government. His study &quot;Revitalizing the U.S. Nuclear Deterrent&quot;, co-authored with Michèle Flournoy, documented these concerns with shocking clarity. Clark initiated PONI out of concern about the future leadership and expertise of the nuclear community.

==Publications==
CSIS publishes books, reports, newsletters, and commentaries targeted at decision makers in policy, government, business, and academia. Primarily it publishes the work of its experts in a specific topic or area of focus in global affairs, including:

* &quot;The Washington Quarterly&quot;, CSIS&#x27;s flagship journal of international affairs that chronicles the &quot;strategic global changes and their impact on public policy.
* &quot;Critical Questions&quot; in which experts affiliated with the think tank provide quick answers to news questions posed international events. For example, Ambassador Karl Inderfurth might answer questions regarding India–United States relations.
* The &quot;Freeman Report Newsletter&quot;, a foreign policy periodical, focusing on economics and international security in Asia and China since the 1970s.
* &quot;New Perspectives in Foreign Policy&quot;, a journal for young professionals in international affairs.

CSIS scholars have published op-eds in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. CSIS experts were quoted or cited thousands of times by the print and online press and appeared frequently in major newswires like the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, &quot;Reuters&quot;, &quot;Agence France Presse&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;. They have also appeared in online media such as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and &quot;Summit News&quot;, &quot;WSJ Live&quot; and were regular guests on the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, NPR&#x27;s Morning Edition and other policy-focused interview shows such as the Charlie Rose Show.
CSIS also has its own YouTube channel, which regularly posts short videos and infographics about the think tank&#x27;s work.

==Leadership and staff==

The chairman of the board of trustees is Thomas Pritzker, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of The Pritzker Organization. He is also executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation and serves on the board of directors of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense John J. Hamre has been the president and chief executive officer of CSIS since April 2000.

The board of trustees has included former senior government officials, including Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, William Cohen, George Argyros, and Brent Scowcroft.

The board also includes major U.S. corporate business leaders as well as prominent figures in the fields of finance, oil &amp; gas, private equity, real estate, academia and media.

CSIS&#x27; 220 full-time staff and its large network of affiliated scholars conduct to develop policy proposals and initiatives that address current issues in international relations. In 2012, CSIS had a staff of 63 program staffers, 73 scholars and 80 interns. The center also worked with 241 affiliate advisors and fellows as well as 202 advisory board members and senior counselors.

CSIS has broadened its reach into public policy analysis under the leadership of Hamre and Nunn. The Department of Defense, as part of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, commissioned CSIS to conduct an independent assessment of U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific Region. Also, in May 2009, President Barack Obama thanked the CSIS bipartisan Commission on Cybersecurity for its help in developing the Obama administration&#x27;s policies on cyber warfare. The center has also been highly influential in the creation of the White House&#x27;s foreign policy. &quot;For the last four years, every Friday afternoon, I&#x27;ve asked my staff to prepare me a reading binder for the weekend,&quot; said National Security Advisor Tom Donilon &quot;The task is to go out and try to find the most interesting things that they can find with respect to national security issues [and] almost every week, there are products from CSIS.&quot; Within the intelligence community, CSIS is known for having &quot;some of the most insightful analysis and innovative ideas for strengthening our national security,&quot; according to CIA Director John Brennan.

==Assessments==
John Kempthorne wrote in &quot;Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting&quot; that CSIS was &quot;heavily funded by the US government, arms dealers and oil companies, [and] is a consistently pro-war think tank&quot;.

<text>Behaviorism is a systematic approach to understand the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that behavior is either a reflex elicited by the pairing of certain antecedent stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual&#x27;s history, including especially reinforcement and punishment contingencies, together with the individual&#x27;s current motivational state and controlling stimuli. Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of heredity in determining behavior, deriving from Skinner&#x27;s three levels of selection: phylogeny, ontogeny, and culture, they focus primarily on environmental events. The cognitive revolution of the late 20th century largely replaced behaviorism as an explanatory theory with cognitive psychology, which unlike behaviorism views internal mental states as explanations for observable behavior.

Behaviorism emerged in the early 1900s as a reaction to depth psychology and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. It was derived from earlier research in the late nineteenth century, such as when Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect, a procedure that involved the use of consequences to strengthen or weaken behavior.

With a 1924 publication, John B. Watson devised methodological behaviorism, which rejected introspective methods and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until 1945 that B. F. Skinner proposed that covert behavior—including cognition and emotions—are subject to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called &quot;radical&quot; behaviorism. While Watson and Ivan Pavlov investigated how (conditioned) neutral stimuli elicit reflexes in respondent conditioning, Skinner assessed the reinforcement histories of the discriminative (antecedent) stimuli that emits behavior; the process became known as operant conditioning.

The application of radical behaviorism—known as applied behavior analysis—is used in a variety of contexts, including, for example, applied animal behavior and organizational behavior management to treatment of mental disorders, such as autism and substance abuse. In addition, while behaviorism and cognitive schools of psychological thought do not agree theoretically, they have complemented each other in the cognitive-behavioral therapies, which have demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies, including simple phobias, PTSD, and mood disorders.

==Branches of behaviorism==
The titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include:
* Behavioral genetics: Proposed in 1869 by Francis Galton, a relative of Charles Darwin. Galton believed that inherited factors had a significant impact on individuals&#x27; behaviors, however did not believe nurturing was not important. Which was later discredited due to association with the eugenics movement - researchers did not want to associate with Nazi politics whether direct or indirect. 
* Interbehaviorism: Proposed by Jacob Robert Kantor before B. F. Skinner&#x27;s writings.
* Methodological behaviorism: John B. Watson&#x27;s behaviorism states that only public events (motor behaviors of an individual) can be objectively observed. Although it was still acknowledged that thoughts and feelings exist, they were not considered part of the science of behavior. It also laid the theoretical foundation for the early approach behavior modification in the 1970s and 1980s. Often compared to the views of B.F Skinner (radical behaviorism). Methodological behaviorism &quot;representing the logical positivist-derived philosophy of science&quot; which is common in science today, radical focuses on the &quot;pragmatist perspective.&quot; 
* Psychological behaviorism: As proposed by Arthur W. Staats, unlike the previous behaviorisms of Skinner, Hull, and Tolman, was based upon a program of human research involving various types of human behavior. Psychological behaviorism introduces new principles of human learning. Humans learn not only by animal learning principles but also by special human learning principles. Those principles involve humans&#x27; uniquely huge learning ability. Humans learn repertoires that enable them to learn other things. Human learning is thus cumulative. No other animal demonstrates that ability, making the human species unique.
* Radical behaviorism: Skinner&#x27;s philosophy is an extension of Watson&#x27;s form of behaviorism by theorizing that processes within the organism—particularly, private events, such as thoughts and feelings—are also part of the science of behavior, and suggests that environmental variables control these internal events just as they control observable behaviors. Behavioral events may be observable but not all are, some are considered &quot;private&quot;: they are accessible and noticed by only the person who is behaving. B.F. Skinner described behavior as the name for the part of the functioning of the organism that consists of its interacting or having commerce with its surrounding environment. In simple terms, how an individual interacts with its surrounding environment.[RB] Although private events cannot be directly seen by others, they are later determined through the species&#x27; overt behavior. Radical behaviorism forms the core philosophy behind behavior analysis. Willard Van Orman Quine used many of radical behaviorism&#x27;s ideas in his study of knowledge and language.
* Teleological behaviorism: Proposed by Howard Rachlin, post-Skinnerian, purposive, close to microeconomics. Focuses on objective observation as opposed to cognitive processes.
* Theoretical behaviorism: Proposed by J. E. R. Staddon, adds a concept of internal state to allow for the effects of context. According to theoretical behaviorism, a state is a set of equivalent histories, i.e., past histories in which members of the same stimulus class produce members of the same response class (i.e., B. F. Skinner&#x27;s concept of the operant). Conditioned stimuli are thus seen to control neither stimulus nor response but state. Theoretical behaviorism is a logical extension of Skinner&#x27;s class-based (generic) definition of the operant.
Two subtypes of theoretical behaviorism are:
* Hullian and post-Hullian: theoretical, group data, not dynamic, physiological
* Purposive: Tolman&#x27;s behavioristic anticipation of cognitive psychology

===Modern-day theory: radical behaviorism===
B. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the experimental analysis of behavior. This viewpoint differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways, but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors also subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism, it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions, such as American pragmatism.

Although John B. Watson mainly emphasized his position of methodological behaviorism throughout his career, Watson and Rosalie Rayner conducted the infamous Little Albert experiment (1920), a study in which Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s theory to respondent conditioning was first applied to eliciting a fearful reflex of crying in a human infant, and this became the launching point for understanding covert behavior (or private events) in &quot;radical&quot; behaviorism; however, Skinner felt that aversive stimuli should only be experimented on with animals and spoke out against Watson for testing something so controversial on a human.

In 1959, Skinner observed the emotions of two pigeons by noting that they appeared angry because their feathers ruffled. The pigeons were placed together in an operant chamber, where they were aggressive as a consequence of previous reinforcement in the environment. Through stimulus control and subsequent discrimination training, whenever Skinner turned off the green light, the pigeons came to notice that the food reinforcer is discontinued following each peck and responded without aggression. Skinner concluded that humans also learn aggression and possess such emotions (as well as other private events) no differently than do nonhuman animals.

==Experimental and conceptual innovations==

As experimental behavioural psychology is related to behavioral neuroscience, we can date the first researches in the area were done in the beginning of 19th century. Later, this essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner&#x27;s early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books &quot;The Behavior of Organisms&quot; and &quot;Schedules of Reinforcement.&quot; Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat&#x27;s lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner&#x27;s theory and S–R theory.

Skinner&#x27;s empirical work expanded on earlier research on trial-and-error learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike&#x27;s notion of a stimulus-response &quot;association&quot; or &quot;connection&quot; was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the &quot;free operant&quot;, so-called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers, a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work &quot;Are Theories of Learning Necessary?&quot; in which he criticizes what he viewed to be theoretical weaknesses then common in the study of psychology. An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior.

==Relation to language==
As Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; and other language-related publications; &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by Noam Chomsky.

Skinner did not respond in detail but claimed that Chomsky failed to understand his ideas, and the disagreements between the two and the theories involved have been further discussed. Innateness theory, which has been heavily critiqued, is opposed to behaviorist theory which claims that language is a set of habits that can be acquired by means of conditioning. According to some, the behaviorist account is a process which would be too slow to explain a phenomenon as complicated as language learning. What was important for a behaviorist&#x27;s analysis of human behavior was not language acquisition so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book &quot;Contingencies of Reinforcement&quot;, Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such &quot;instructional control&quot; over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of relational frame theory.

==Education==

B. F. Skinner&#x27;s book &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; (1957) does not quite emphasize on language development, but to understand human behavior. Additionally, his work serves in understanding social interactions in the child&#x27;s early developmental stages focusing on the topic of caregiver-infant interaction. Skinner&#x27;s functional analysis of verbal behavior terminology and theories is commonly used to understand the relationship between language development but was primarily designed to describe behaviors of interest and explain the cause of those behaviors. Noam Chomsky, an American linguistic professor, has criticized and questioned Skinner&#x27;s theories about the possible suggestion of parental tutoring in language development. However, there is a lack of supporting evidence where Skinner makes the statement. Understanding language is a complex topic but can be understood through the use of two theories: innateness and acquisition. Both theories offer a different perspective whether language is inherently &quot;acquired&quot; or &quot;learned&quot;.

==Operant conditioning==
Operant conditioning was developed by B.F. Skinner in 1938 and is form of learning in which the frequency of a behavior is controlled by consequences to change behavior. In other words, behavior is controlled by historical consequential contingencies, particularly reinforcement—a stimulus that increases the probability of performing behaviors, and punishment—a stimulus that decreases such probability. The core tools of consequences are either positive (presenting stimuli following a response), or negative (withdrawn stimuli following a response).

The following descriptions explains the concepts of four common types of consequences in operant conditioning:
* Positive reinforcement: Providing a stimulus that an individual enjoys, seeks, or craves, in order to reinforce desired behaviors. For example, when a person is teaching a dog to sit, they pair the command &quot;sit&quot; with a treat. The treat is the positive reinforcement to the behavior of sitting. The key to making positive reinforcement effect is to reward the behavior immediately.
* Negative reinforcement: Increases the frequency of a behavior, but the behavior results from removing unpleasant or unwanted stimulus. For example, a child hates being nagged (negative) to clean his room (behavior) which increases the frequency of the child cleaning his room to prevent his mother from nagging. Another example would be putting on sunscreen (behavior) before going outside to prevent sunburn (negative).
* Positive punishment: Providing a stimulus that an individual does not desire to decrease undesired behaviors. For example, if a child engages in an undesired behavior, then parents may spank (stimulus) the child to correct their behavior.
* Negative punishment: Removing a stimulus that an individual desires in order to decrease undesired behaviors. An example of this would be grounding a child for failing a test. Grounding in this example is taking away the child&#x27;s ability to play video games. As long as it is clear that the ability to play video games was taken away because they failed a test, this is negative punishment. The key here is the connection to the behavior and the result of the behavior.

A classical experiment in operant conditioning, for example, is the &quot;Skinner Box&quot;, &quot;puzzle box&quot; or operant conditioning chamber to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats, cats and other species. From this experiment, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently with food. Skinner also found that he could shape (create new behavior) the rats&#x27; behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.

Skinner&#x27;s model was based on the premise that reinforcement is used for the desired actions or responses while punishment was used to stop the responses of the undesired actions that are not. This theory proved that humans or animals will repeat any action that leads to a positive outcome, and avoid any action that leads to a negative outcome. The experiment with the pigeons showed that a positive outcome leads to learned behavior since the pigeon learned to peck the disc in return for the reward of food.

These historical consequential contingencies subsequently lead to (antecedent) stimulus control, but in contrast to respondent conditioning where antecedent stimuli elicit reflexive behavior, operant behavior is only emitted and therefore does not force its occurrence. It includes the following controlling stimuli:
* Discriminative stimulus (Sd): An antecedent stimulus that increases the chance of the organism engaging in a behavior. One example of this occurred in Skinner&#x27;s laboratory. Whenever the green light (Sd) appeared, it signaled the pigeon to perform the behavior of pecking because it learned in the past that each time it pecked, food was presented (the positive reinforcing stimulus).
* Stimulus delta (S-delta): An antecedent stimulus that signals the organism not to perform a behavior since it was extinguished or punished in the past. One notable instance of this occurs when a person stops their car immediately after the traffic light turns red (S-delta). However, the person could decide to drive through the red light, but subsequently receive a speeding ticket (the positive punishing stimulus), so this behavior will potentially not reoccur following the presence of the S-delta.

==Respondent conditioning==

Although operant conditioning plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, respondent conditioning (also called Pavlovian or classical conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that needs not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov&#x27;s experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure. In the beginning, the dog was provided meat (unconditioned stimulus, UCS, naturally elicit a response that is not controlled) to eat, resulting in increased salivation (unconditioned response, UCR, which means that a response is naturally caused by UCS). Afterward, a bell ring was presented together with food to the dog. Although bell ring was a neutral stimulus (NS, meaning that the stimulus did not have any effect), dog would start to salivate when only hearing a bell ring after a number of pairings. Eventually, the neutral stimulus (bell ring) became conditioned. Therefore, salivation was elicited as a conditioned response (the response same as the unconditioned response), pairing up with meat—the conditioned stimulus) Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed. The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.

Watson&#x27;s &quot;Behaviourist Manifesto&quot; has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the &quot;science of behaviour&quot;; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behaviour (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states); the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behaviour. Following Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behaviour is just a more complex version in respect to behaviour displayed by other species.

==In philosophy==

Behaviorism is a psychological movement that can be contrasted with philosophy of mind. The basic premise of behaviorism is that the study of behavior should be a natural science, such as chemistry or physics. Initially behaviorism rejected any reference to hypothetical inner states of organisms as causes for their behavior, but B.F. Skinner&#x27;s radical behaviorism reintroduced reference to inner states and also advocated for the study of thoughts and feelings as behaviors subject to the same mechanisms as external behavior. Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to Edmund Fantino and colleagues: &quot;Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach.&quot;

Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within philosophy of language and analytic philosophy. It is sometimes argued that Ludwig Wittgenstein defended a logical behaviorist position (e.g., the &quot;beetle in a box&quot; argument). In logical positivism (as held, e.g., by Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel), the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. W. V. O. Quine made use of a type of behaviorism, influenced by some of Skinner&#x27;s ideas, in his own work on language. Quine&#x27;s work in semantics differed substantially from the empiricist semantics of Carnap which he attempted to create an alternative to, couching his semantic theory in references to physical objects rather than sensations. Gilbert Ryle defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;. Ryle&#x27;s central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented &quot;category mistakes&quot;, and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. Daniel Dennett likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist, though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner&#x27;s rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.
===Law of effect and trace conditioning===
* Law of effect: Although Edward Thorndike&#x27;s methodology mainly dealt with reinforcing observable behavior, it viewed cognitive antecedents as the causes of behavior, and was theoretically much more similar to the cognitive-behavior therapies than classical (methodological) or modern-day (radical) behaviorism. Nevertheless, Skinner&#x27;s operant conditioning was heavily influenced by the Law of Effect&#x27;s principle of reinforcement.
* Trace conditioning: Akin to B.F. Skinner&#x27;s radical behaviorism, it is a respondent conditioning technique based on Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s concept of a &quot;memory trace&quot; in which the observer recalls the conditioned stimulus (CS), with the memory or recall being the unconditioned response (UR). There is also a time delay between the CS and unconditioned stimulus (US), causing the conditioned response (CR)—particularly the reflex—to be faded over time. According to Marchand, the hippocampus is a part of the cognitive processes during trace conditioning and other forms of classical conditioning in two ways: needing to overcome stimuli or due to mre activity from complex challenges. However, results may vary due to the nature of the task and the design of the experiment .

===Molecular versus molar behaviorism===
Skinner&#x27;s view of behavior is most often characterized as a &quot;molecular&quot; view of behavior; that is, behavior can be decomposed into atomistic parts or molecules. This view is inconsistent with Skinner&#x27;s complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article &quot;Selection by Consequences&quot;. Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: biology (the natural selection or phylogeny of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, culture (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from melioration theory, negative power function discounting or additive versions of negative power function discounting. According to Moore, the perseverance in a molecular examination of behavior may be sign of a desire for an in-depth understanding, maybe to identify any underlying mechanism or components that contribute to comples actions. This strategy might involve elements, procedure, or variables that contribute to behaviorism.

Molar behaviorists, such as Howard Rachlin, Richard Herrnstein, and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism&#x27;s history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as &quot;associative strength&quot;, are better replaced by molar variables such as rate of reinforcement. Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe &quot;loving someone&quot; as a pattern of loving behavior over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as &quot;love&quot;.

===Theoretical behaviorism===
Skinner&#x27;s radical behaviorism has been highly successful experimentally, revealing new phenomena with new methods, but Skinner&#x27;s dismissal of theory limited its development. Theoretical behaviorism recognized that a historical system, an organism, has a state as well as sensitivity to stimuli and the ability to emit responses. Indeed, Skinner himself acknowledged the possibility of what he called &quot;latent&quot; responses in humans, even though he neglected to extend this idea to rats and pigeons. Latent responses constitute a repertoire, from which operant reinforcement can select. Theoretical behaviorism links between the brain and the behavior that provides a real understanding of the behavior, rather than a mental presumption of how brain-behavior relates. The theoretical concept of behaviorism are blended with knowledge of mental structure such as memory and expectancies associated with inflexable behaviorist stances that have traditionally forbidden the examination of the mental state. Because of its flexibility, theoretical behaviorism permits the cognitive process to have an impact on behavior.

== Behavior analysis and culture ==
From its inception, behavior analysis has centered its examination on cultural occurrences (Skinner, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1974). Nevertheless, the methods used to tackle these occurrences have evolved. Initially, culture was perceived as a factor influencing behavior, later becoming a subject of study in itself. This shift prompted research into group practices and the potential for significant behavioral transformations on a larger scale. Following Glenn&#x27;s (1986) influential work, &quot;Metacontingencies in Walden Two&quot;,  numerous research endeavors exploring behavior analysis in cultural contexts have centered around the concept of the metacontingency. Glenn (2003) posited that understanding the origins and development of cultures necessitates delving beyond evolutionary and behavioral principles governing species characteristics and individual learned behaviors requires analysis at a major level.

== Behavior informatics and behavior computing ==
With the fast growth of big behavioral data and applications, behavior analysis is ubiquitous. Understanding behavior from the informatics and computing perspective becomes increasingly critical for in-depth understanding of what, why and how behaviors are formed, interact, evolve, change and affect business and decision. Behavior informatics and behavior computing deeply explore behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.

Pavel et al. (2015) found that in the realm of healthcare and health psychology, substantial evidence supports the notion that personalized health interventions yield greater effectiveness compared to standardized approaches. Additionally, researchers found that recent progress in sensor and communication technology, coupled with data analysis and computational modeling, holds significant potential in revolutionizing interventions aimed at changing health behavior. Simultaneous advancements in sensor and communication technology, alongside the field of data science, have now made it possible to comprehensively measure behaviors occurring in real-life settings. These two elements, when combined with advancements in computational modeling, have laid the groundwork for the emerging discipline known as behavioral informatics. Behavioral informatics represents a scientific and engineering domain encompassing behavior tracking, evaluation, computational modeling, deduction, and intervention.

== Criticisms and limitations ==

In the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the cognitive revolution. This shift was due to radical behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the cognitive therapy movement.
In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* Noam Chomsky&#x27;s 1959 critique of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot;.
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of psychological thought. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. The effective result was more of a framework conceptualization of mental functions with their counterparts in computers (memory, storage, retrieval, etc.).
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as George Mandler&#x27;s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the &quot;Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences&quot;

In more recent years, several scholars have expressed reservations about the pragmatic tendencies of behaviorism.
* Burgos (2003) highlights the potential peril of pragmatism, noting that within William James pragmatism—widely discussed in philosophy and science, including behaviorism and behavior analysis—there exists a tolerance for anything deemed useful, even if nonsensical. Additionally, Burgos (2007) contends that pragmatism engenders a relativism that contradicts the emphasis on science as the paramount path to knowledge.
* Staddon (2018, as cited in Araiba, 2019) further argues that the proliferation of diversification in social science poses disadvantages by hindering healthy and open scientific communication and critique among specialized areas.
* Rider (1991) shares a similar concern, highlighting reduced communication between the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis. Contrarily, diversification is portrayed as an innate and uncontrollable consequence of the environment, a natural facet contributing to species&#x27; survival. It is viewed as an integral aspect of the evolution of behaviorism.

In the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. Cognitive neuroscience, however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.

=== Limitations ===
Staddon (1993) found that Skinner&#x27;s theory presents two significant deficiencies: Firstly, he downplayed the significance of processes responsible for generating novel behaviors, which it is term as &quot;behavioral variation.&quot; Skinner primarily emphasized reinforcement as the sole determinant for selecting responses, overlooking these critical processes involved in creating new behaviors. Secondly, both Skinner and many other behaviorists of that era endorsed contiguity as a sufficient process for response selection. However, Rescorla and Wagner (1972) later demonstrated, particularly in classical conditioning, that competition is an essential complement to contiguity. They showed that in operant conditioning, both contiguity and competition are imperative for discerning cause-and-effect relationships.

The influential Rescorla-Wagner model  highlights the significance of competition for limited &quot;associative value,&quot; essential for assessing predictability. A similar formal argument was presented by Ying Zhang and John Staddon (1991, in press) concerning operant conditioning: the combination of contiguity and competition among action tendencies suffices as an assignment-of-credit mechanism capable of detecting genuine instrumental contingency between a response and its reinforcer. This mechanism delineates the limitations of Skinner&#x27;s idea of adventitious reinforcement, revealing its efficacy only under stringent conditions – when the reinforcement&#x27;s strengthening effect is nearly constant across instances and with very short intervals between reinforcers. However, these conditions rarely hold in reality: behavior following reinforcement tends to exhibit high variability, and superstitious behavior diminishes with extremely brief intervals between reinforcements.

==Behavior therapy==

Behavior therapy is a term referring to different types of therapies that treat mental health disorders. It identifies and helps change people&#x27;s unhealthy behaviors or destructive behaviors through learning theory and conditioning. Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s classical conditioning, as well as counterconditioning are the basis for much of clinical behavior therapy, but also includes other techniques, including operant conditioning—or contingency management, and modeling (sometimes called observational learning). A frequently noted behavior therapy is systematic desensitization (graduated exposure therapy), which was first demonstrated by Joseph Wolpe and Arnold Lazarus.

===Behavior analysis===

Applied behavior analysis (ABA)—also called behavioral engineering—is a scientific discipline that applies the principles of behavior analysis to change behavior. ABA derived from much earlier research in the &quot;Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior&quot;, which was founded by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues at Harvard University. Nearly a decade after the study &quot;The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer&quot; (1959) was published in that journal, which demonstrated how effective the token economy was in reinforcing more adaptive behavior for hospitalized patients with schizophrenia and intellectual disability, it led to researchers at the University of Kansas to start the &quot;Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis&quot; in 1968.

Although ABA and behavior modification are similar behavior-change technologies in that the learning environment is modified through respondent and operant conditioning, behavior modification did not initially address the causes of the behavior (particularly, the environmental stimuli that occurred in the past), or investigate solutions that would otherwise prevent the behavior from reoccurring. As the evolution of ABA began to unfold in the mid-1980s, functional behavior assessments (FBAs) were developed to clarify the function of that behavior, so that it is accurately determined which differential reinforcement contingencies will be most effective and less likely for aversive punishments to be administered. In addition, methodological behaviorism was the theory underpinning behavior modification since private events were not conceptualized during the 1970s and early 1980s, which contrasted from the radical behaviorism of behavior analysis. ABA—the term that replaced behavior modification—has emerged into a thriving field.

The independent development of behaviour analysis outside the United States also continues to develop. In the US, the American Psychological Association (APA) features a subdivision for Behavior Analysis, titled APA Division 25: Behavior Analysis, which has been in existence since 1964, and the interests among behavior analysts today are wide-ranging, as indicated in a review of the 30 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI). Such interests include everything from animal behavior and environmental conservation to classroom instruction (such as direct instruction and precision teaching), verbal behavior, developmental disabilities and autism, clinical psychology (i.e., forensic behavior analysis), behavioral medicine (i.e., behavioral gerontology, AIDS prevention, and fitness training), and consumer behavior analysis.

The field of applied animal behavior—a sub-discipline of ABA that involves training animals—is regulated by the Animal Behavior Society, and those who practice this technique are called applied animal behaviorists. Research on applied animal behavior has been frequently conducted in the &quot;Applied Animal Behaviour Science&quot; journal since its founding in 1974.

ABA has also been particularly well-established in the area of developmental disabilities since the 1960s, but it was not until the late 1980s that individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders were beginning to grow so rapidly and groundbreaking research was being published that parent advocacy groups started demanding for services throughout the 1990s, which encouraged the formation of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, a credentialing program that certifies professionally trained behavior analysts on the national level to deliver such services. Nevertheless, the certification is applicable to all human services related to the rather broad field of behavior analysis (other than the treatment for autism), and the ABAI currently has 14 accredited MA and Ph.D. programs for comprehensive study in that field.

Early behavioral interventions (EBIs) based on ABA are empirically validated for teaching children with autism and have been proven as such for over the past five decades. Since the late 1990s and throughout the twenty-first century, early ABA interventions have also been identified as the treatment of choice by the US Surgeon General, American Academy of Pediatrics, and US National Research Council.

Discrete trial training—also called early &quot;intensive&quot; behavioral intervention—is the traditional EBI technique implemented for thirty to forty hours per week that instructs a child to sit in a chair, imitate fine and gross motor behaviors, as well as learn eye contact and speech, which are taught through shaping, modeling, and prompting, with such prompting being phased out as the child begins mastering each skill. When the child becomes more verbal from discrete trials, the table-based instructions are later discontinued, and another EBI procedure known as incidental teaching is introduced in the natural environment by having the child ask for desired items kept out of their direct access, as well as allowing the child to choose the play activities that will motivate them to engage with their facilitators before teaching the child how to interact with other children their own age.

A related term for incidental teaching, called pivotal response treatment (PRT), refers to EBI procedures that exclusively entail twenty-five hours per week of naturalistic teaching (without initially using discrete trials). Current research is showing that there is a wide array of learning styles and that is the children with receptive language delays who initially require discrete trials to acquire speech.

Organizational behavior management, which applies contingency management procedures to model and reinforce appropriate work behavior for employees in organizations, has developed a particularly strong following within ABA, as evidenced by the formation of the OBM Network and &quot;Journal of Organizational Behavior Management&quot;, which was rated the third-highest impact journal in applied psychology by ISI JOBM rating.

Modern-day clinical behavior analysis has also witnessed a massive resurgence in research, with the development of relational frame theory (RFT), which is described as an extension of verbal behavior and a &quot;post-Skinnerian account of language and cognition.&quot; RFT also forms the empirical basis for acceptance and commitment therapy, a therapeutic approach to counseling often used to manage such conditions as anxiety and obesity that consists of acceptance and commitment, value-based living, cognitive defusion, counterconditioning (mindfulness), and contingency management (positive reinforcement). Another evidence-based counseling technique derived from RFT is the functional analytic psychotherapy known as behavioral activation that relies on the ACL model—awareness, courage, and love—to reinforce more positive moods for those struggling with depression.

Incentive-based contingency management (CM) is the standard of care for adults with substance-use disorders; it has also been shown to be highly effective for other addictions (i.e., obesity and gambling). Although it does not directly address the underlying causes of behavior, incentive-based CM is highly behavior analytic as it targets the function of the client&#x27;s motivational behavior by relying on a preference assessment, which is an assessment procedure that allows the individual to select the preferred reinforcer (in this case, the monetary value of the voucher, or the use of other incentives, such as prizes). Another evidence-based CM intervention for substance abuse is community reinforcement approach and family training that uses FBAs and counterconditioning techniques—such as behavioral skills training and relapse prevention—to model and reinforce healthier lifestyle choices which promote self-management of abstinence from drugs, alcohol, or cigarette smoking during high-risk exposure when engaging with family members, friends, and co-workers.

While schoolwide positive behavior support consists of conducting assessments and a task analysis plan to differentially reinforce curricular supports that replace students&#x27; disruptive behavior in the classroom, pediatric feeding therapy incorporates a liquid chaser and chin feeder to shape proper eating behavior for children with feeding disorders. Habit reversal training, an approach firmly grounded in counterconditioning which uses contingency management procedures to reinforce alternative behavior, is currently the only empirically validated approach for managing tic disorders.

Some studies on exposure (desensitization) therapies—which refer to an array of interventions based on the respondent conditioning procedure known as habituation and typically infuses counterconditioning procedures, such as meditation and breathing exercises—have recently been published in behavior analytic journals since the 1990s, as most other research is conducted from a cognitive-behavior therapy framework. When based on a behavior analytic research standpoint, FBAs are implemented to precisely outline how to employ the flooding form of desensitization (also called direct exposure therapy) for those who are unsuccessful in overcoming their specific phobia through systematic desensitization (also known as graduated exposure therapy). These studies also reveal that systematic desensitization is more effective for children if used in conjunction with shaping, which is further termed &quot;contact&quot; desensitization, but this comparison has yet to be substantiated with adults.

Other widely published behavior analytic journals include &quot;Behavior Modification&quot;, &quot;The Behavior Analyst&quot;, &quot;Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions&quot;, &quot;Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science&quot;, &quot;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior&quot;, &quot;Behavior and Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Behavior and Social Issues&quot;, and &quot;The Psychological Record&quot;.

===Cognitive-behavior therapy===

Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a behavior therapy discipline that often overlaps considerably with the clinical behavior analysis subfield of ABA, but differs in that it initially incorporates cognitive restructuring and emotional regulation to alter a person&#x27;s cognition and emotions. Various forms of CBT have been used to treat physically experienced symptoms that disrupt individuals&#x27; livelihood, which often stem from complex mental health disorders. Complications of many trauma-induced disorders result in lack of sleep and nightmares, with cognitive behavior therapy functioning as an intervention found to reduce the average number of PTSD patients suffering from related sleep disturbance.

A popularly noted counseling intervention known as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) includes the use of a chain analysis, as well as cognitive restructuring, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, counterconditioning (mindfulness), and contingency management (positive reinforcement). DBT is quite similar to acceptance and commitment therapy, but contrasts in that it derives from a CBT framework. Although DBT is most widely researched for and empirically validated to reduce the risk of suicide in psychiatric patients with borderline personality disorder, it can often be applied effectively to other mental health conditions, such as substance abuse, as well as mood and eating disorders. A study on BPD was conducted, confirming DBT as a constructive therapeutic option for emotionally unregulated patients. Before DBT, participants with borderline personality disorder were shown images of highly emotional people and neuron activity in the amygdala was recorded via fMRI; after 1 year of consistent dialectical behavior therapy, participants were re-tested, with fMRI capturing a decrease in amygdala hyperactivity (emotional activation) in response to the applied stimulus, exhibiting increases in emotional regulation capabilities.

Most research on exposure therapies (also called desensitization)—ranging from eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy to exposure and response prevention—are conducted through a CBT framework in non-behavior analytic journals, and these enhanced exposure therapies are well-established in the research literature for treating phobic, post-traumatic stress, and other anxiety disorders (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD).

Cognitive-based behavioral activation (BA)—the psychotherapeutic approach used for depression—is shown to be highly effective and is widely used in clinical practice. Some large randomized control trials have indicated that cognitive-based BA is as beneficial as antidepressant medications but more efficacious than traditional cognitive therapy. Other commonly used clinical treatments derived from behavioral learning principles that are often implemented through a CBT model include community reinforcement approach and family training, and habit reversal training for substance abuse and tics, respectively.

<doc id="540802" wikidata="Q186539" url="?curid=540802" title="Founding Fathers of the United States">
<text>The Founding Fathers of the United States, often simply referred to as the Founding Fathers or the Founders, were a group of late-18th-century American revolutionary leaders who united the Thirteen Colonies, oversaw the War of Independence from Great Britain, established the United States of America, and crafted a framework of government for the new nation. 

The Founding Fathers include those who signed the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution and other founding documents; it can also be applied to certain military personnel who fought in the American Revolution. The single person most identified as &quot;Father&quot; of the United States is George Washington, a general in the American Revolution and the 1st President of the United States. In 1973, historian Richard B. Morris identified seven figures as key founders, based on what he called the &quot;triple tests&quot; of leadership, longevity, and statesmanship: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Washington.

Most of the Founding Fathers were of English ancestry, though many had family roots extending across various regions of the British Isles, including Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Additionally, some traced their lineage back to the early Dutch settlers of New York (New Netherland) during the colonial era, while others were descendants of French Huguenots who settled in the colonies, escaping religious persecution in France.

==Historical founders==
Historian Richard Morris&#x27; selection of seven key founders was widely accepted through the 20th century. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that were charged by the Second Continental Congress with drafting the Declaration of Independence. Franklin, Adams, and John Jay negotiated the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which established American independence and brought an end to the American Revolutionary War. The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York (1777) and Massachusetts (1780) proved influential in the language used in developing the U.S. Constitution. &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, which advocated the ratification of the Constitution, were written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Jay. George Washington was commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and later president of the Constitutional Convention. 

Each of these men held additional important roles in the early government of the United States. Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison served as the first four presidents; Adams and Jefferson were the nation&#x27;s first two vice presidents; Jay was the nation&#x27;s first chief justice; Hamilton was the first secretary of the treasury; Jefferson was the first secretary of state; and Franklin was America&#x27;s most senior diplomat from the start of the Revolutionary War through its conclusion with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

The list of Founding Fathers is often expanded to include the signers of the Declaration of Independence and individuals who later approved the U.S. Constitution. Some scholars regard all delegates to the Constitutional Convention as Founding Fathers whether they approved the Constitution or not. In addition, some historians include signers of the Articles of Confederation, which was adopted in 1781 as the nation&#x27;s first constitution.

Historians have come to recognize others as founders, such as Revolutionary War military leaders as well as participants in developments leading up to the war, including prominent writers, orators, and other men and women who contributed to cause. Since the 19th century, the Founding Fathers have shifted from the concept of them as demigods who created the modern nation-state, to take into account their inability to address issues such as slavery and the debt owed after the American Revolutionary War. Scholars emphasize that the Founding Fathers&#x27; accomplishments and shortcomings be viewed within the context of their time.

==Origin of phrase==
The phrase &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; was first used by U.S. senator Warren G. Harding in his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention of 1916. Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, presidential inauguration. While U.S. presidents used the terms &quot;founders&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot; in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding&#x27;s phrase would be used again during the presidential inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985.

In 1811, responding to praise for his generation, John Adams wrote to a younger Josiah Quincy III, &quot;I ought not to object to your Reverence for your Fathers as you call them ... but to tell you a very great secret ... I have no reason to believe We were better than you are.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;Don&#x27;t call me, ... Father ... [or] Founder ... These titles belong to no man, but to the American people in general.&quot;

In Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s second presidential inaugural address in 1805, he referred to those who first came to the New World as &quot;forefathers&quot;. At his 1825 inauguration, John Quincy Adams called the U.S. Constitution &quot;the work of our forefathers&quot; and expressed his gratitude to &quot;founders of the Union&quot;. In July of the following year, this second President Adams, in an executive order upon the deaths of his father, John, and Jefferson, who both died on the same day, paid tribute to them as &quot;Fathers&quot; and &quot;Founders of the Republic&quot;. These terms were used in the U.S. throughout the 19th century, from the inaugurations of Martin Van Buren and James Polk in 1837 and 1845, to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Cooper Union speech in 1860 and his Gettysburg Address in 1863, and up to William McKinley&#x27;s first inauguration in 1897.

At a 1902 celebration of Washington&#x27;s Birthday in Brooklyn, James M. Beck, a constitutional lawyer and later a U.S. congressman, delivered an address, &quot;Founders of the Republic&quot;, in which he connected the concepts of founders and fathers, saying: &quot;It is well for us to remember certain human aspects of the founders of the republic. Let me first refer to the fact that these fathers of the republic were for the most part young men.&quot;

==List of Founding Fathers==
===Framers and signers===
The National Archives has identified three founding documents as the &quot;Charters of Freedom&quot;: Declaration of Independence, United States Constitution, and Bill of Rights. According to the Archives, these documents &quot;have secured the rights of the American people for nearly two and a half centuries and are considered instrumental to the founding and philosophy of the United States.&quot; In addition, as the nation&#x27;s first constitution, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union is also a founding document. As a result, signers of three key documents are generally considered to be Founding Fathers of the United States: Declaration of Independence (DI), Articles of Confederation (AC), and U.S. Constitution (USC). The following table provides a list of these signers, some of whom signed more than one document.
==== Other delegates ====
The 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention are referred to as framers. Of these, the 16 listed below did not sign the document. Three refused, while the remainder left early, either in protest of the proceedings or for personal reasons. Nevertheless, some sources regard all framers as founders, including those who did not sign:
* William Richardson Davie, North Carolina
* Oliver Ellsworth, Connecticut
* Elbridge Gerry, Massachusetts *
* William Houston, New Jersey
* William Houstoun, Georgia
* John Lansing Jr., New York
* Alexander Martin, North Carolina
* Luther Martin, Maryland
* George Mason, Virginia *
* James McClurg, Virginia
* John Francis Mercer, Maryland
* William Pierce, Georgia
* Edmund Randolph, Virginia *
* Caleb Strong, Massachusetts
* George Wythe, Virginia
* Robert Yates, New York
(*) Randolph, Mason, and Gerry were the only three present at the Constitution&#x27;s adoption who refused to sign.

=== Additional Founding Fathers ===
In addition to the signers and Framers of the founding documents and one of the seven notable leaders previously mentioned—John Jay—the following are regarded as founders based on their contributions to the creation and early development of the new nation:

* Elias Boudinot, New Jersey representative in the Continental Congress, Congress of the Confederation (president 1782–1783), and the first three U.S. Congresses. Boudinot was director of the U.S. Mint under presidents Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, and also was the founding president of the American Bible Society.
* Aaron Burr, vice president under Jefferson
* George Clinton, first governor of New York, 1777–1795, served again from 1801 to 1805, and was the fourth vice president of the US, 1805–1812. He was an anti-Federalist advocate of the Bill of Rights.
* Patrick Henry, gifted orator, known for his famous quote, &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot;, served in the First Continental Congress in 1774 and briefly in the Second Congress in 1775 before returning to Virginia to lead its militia. He then completed terms as the first and sixth governor of Virginia, 1776–1779 and 1784–1786. 
* Esek Hopkins, commander-in-chief of the Continental Navy
* Henry Knox served as chief artillery officer in most of Washington&#x27;s campaigns. His earliest achievement was the capture of over 50 pieces of artillery, primarily cannons, at New York&#x27;s Fort Ticonderoga, one of the keys to Washington&#x27;s capture of Boston in early 1776. Knox became the first secretary of war under the U.S. Constitution in 1789.
* Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, French Marquis who became a Continental Army general. Served without pay, brought a ship to America, outfitted for war, provided clothing and other provisions for the patriot cause, all at his own expense.
*Arthur Lee, diplomat who helped negotiate and signed the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, along with Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane.
* Robert R. Livingston, member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence, 1776; first U.S. secretary of foreign affairs, 1781–1783, and first chancellor of New York, 1777–1801. He administered the presidential oath of office at the first inauguration of George Washington and with James Monroe negotiated the Louisiana Purchase as the minister to France.
* John Marshall served with George Washington at Valley Forge and later would be the first to refer to him as &quot;the Father of his country&quot;. Appointed the fourth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court under John Adams, Marshall defined the authority of the court and ensured the stability of the federal government during the first three decades of the 19th century.
* James Monroe, elected to the Virginia legislature (1782); member of the Continental Congress (1783–1786); fifth president of the United States for two terms (1817–1825); Negotiated the Louisiana Purchase along with Robert Livingston.
* James Otis Jr., pamphleteer, one of the earliest proponents of patriotic causes, an opponent of slavery, and leader of Massachusetts&#x27; Committee of Correspondence, all in the 1760s.
* Thomas Paine, author of &quot;Common Sense&quot; and other influential pamphlets in the 1770s; sometimes referred to as &quot;Father of the American Revolution&quot;. While John Adams strongly criticized Paine for failing to see the need for a separation of powers in government, &quot;Common Sense&quot; proved crucial in building support for independence following its publication in January 1776.
* Timothy Pickering, Secretary of War, U.S. secretary of state, from Massachusetts. Fired by President John Adams; replaced by John Marshall.
* Thomas Pinckney, signer of the Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty with Spain, fought as an officer in the Continental Army and served as a United States ambassador to Great Britain
* Peyton Randolph, speaker of Virginia&#x27;s House of Burgesses, president of the First Continental Congress, and a signer of the Continental Association.
* John Rogers, Maryland lawyer and judge, delegate to the Continental Congress who voted for the Declaration of Independence but fell ill before he could sign it.
* Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress from its formation to its final session, 1774–1789.
* Joseph Warren, respected physician and architect of the Revolutionary movement, known as the &quot;Founding Martyr&quot; for his death at the Battle of Bunker Hill, drafted the Suffolk Resolves in response to the Intolerable Acts.
* &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne, a prominent army general during the Revolutionary War.
* Thomas Willing, delegate to the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania, the first president of the Bank of North America, and the first president of the First Bank of the United States
* Henry Wisner, New York Continental Congress delegate who voted for the Declaration of Independence but left Philadelphia before the signing.




=== Women founders ===
Historians have come to recognize the roles women played in the nation&#x27;s early development, using the term &quot;Founding Mothers&quot;. Among the women honored in this respect are:
* Abigail Adams, wife, confidant, advisor to John Adams, second First Lady, and mother of the sixth U.S. president John Quincy Adams, famously extolled her husband to &quot;Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors . . . [or] we are determined to foment a Rebelion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation&quot;.
* Mercy Otis Warren, poet, playwright, and pamphleteer during the American Revolution

=== Other patriots ===
The following men and women are also recognized for the notable contributions they made during the founding era:
* Ethan Allen, military leader and founder of Vermont.
* Richard Allen, African-American bishop, founder of the Free African Society and the African Methodist Episcopal Church
* Crispus Attucks, believed to be of Native American and African descent, was the first of five persons killed in the Boston Massacre of 1770, and thus the first to die in the American Revolution. Of the deaths at Boston John Adams would later write, &quot;On that night the foundations of American independence was laid.&quot;
* Penelope Barker, organized and wrote the resolution of the Edenton Tea Party (October 1774), an activist throughout the American Revolution.
* John Barry, an officer in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War, has been credited as &quot;The Father of the American Navy&quot; (sharing the descriptor with John Paul Jones and John Adams) and was the first captain of a U.S. warship commissioned for service under the Continental flag.

Cato carried intelligence gathered by Mulligan to officers in the Continental Army and other revolutionaries, including through British-held territory, which was credited for likely saving George Washington&#x27;s life on at least two occasions. He was granted his freedom in 1778 for his service.

== The colonies unite (1765–1774) ==
In the mid-1760s, Parliament began levying taxes on the colonies to finance Britain&#x27;s debts from the French and Indian War, a decade-long conflict that ended in 1763. Opposition to Stamp Act and Townshend Acts united the colonies in a common cause. While the Stamp Act was withdrawn, taxes on tea remained under the Townshend Acts and took on a new form in 1773 with Parliament&#x27;s adoption of the Tea Act. The new tea tax, along with stricter customs enforcement, was not well-received across the colonies, particularly in Massachusetts.

On December 16, 1773, 150 colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded ships in Boston and dumped 342 chests of tea into the city&#x27;s harbor, a protest that came to be known as the Boston Tea Party. Orchestrated by Samuel Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence, the protest was viewed as treasonous by British authorities. In response, Parliament passed the Coercive or Intolerable Acts, a series of punitive laws that closed Boston&#x27;s port and placed the colony under direct control of the British government. These measures stirred unrest throughout the colonies, which felt Parliament had overreached its authority and was posing a threat to the self-rule that had existed in the Americas since the 1600s.

Intent on responding to the Acts, twelve of the Thirteen Colonies agreed to send delegates to meet in Philadelphia as the First Continental Congress, with Georgia declining because it needed British military support in its conflict with native tribes. The concept of an American union had been entertained long before 1774, but always embraced the idea that it would be subject to the authority of the British Empire. By 1774, however, letters published in colonial newspapers, mostly by anonymous writers, began asserting the need for a &quot;Congress&quot; to represent all Americans, one that would have equal status with British authority.

== Continental Congress (1774–1775) ==
The Continental Congress was convened to deal with a series of pressing issues the colonies were facing with Britain. Its delegates were men considered to be the most intelligent and thoughtful among the colonialists. In the wake of the Intolerable Acts, at the hands of an unyielding British King and Parliament, the colonies were forced to choose between either totally submitting to arbitrary Parliamentary authority or resorting to unified armed resistance. The new Congress functioned as the directing body in declaring a great war and was sanctioned only by reason of the guidance it provided during the armed struggle. Its authority remained ill-defined, and few of its delegates realized that events would soon lead them to decide policies that ultimately established a &quot;new power among the nations&quot;. In the process the Congress performed many experiments in government before an adequate Constitution evolved.

=== First Continental Congress (1774) ===

The First Continental Congress convened at Philadelphia&#x27;s Carpenter&#x27;s Hall on September 5, 1774. The Congress, which had no legal authority to raise taxes or call on colonial militias, consisted of 56 delegates, including George Washington of Virginia; John Adams and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts; John Jay of New York; John Dickinson of Pennsylvania; and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. Peyton Randolph of Virginia was unanimously elected its first president.

The Congress came close to disbanding in its first few days over the issue of representation, with smaller colonies desiring equality with the larger ones. While Patrick Henry, from the largest colony, Virginia, disagreed, he stressed the greater importance of uniting the colonies: &quot;The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American!&quot;. The delegates then began with a discussion of the Suffolk Resolves, which had just been approved at a town meeting in Milton, Massachusetts. Joseph Warren, chairman of the Resolves drafting committee, had dispatched Paul Revere to deliver signed copies to the Congress in Philadelphia. The Resolves called for the ouster of British officials, a trade embargo of British goods, and the formation of a militia throughout the colonies. Despite the radical nature of the resolves, on September 17 the Congress passed them in their entirety in exchange for assurances that Massachusetts&#x27; colonists would do nothing to provoke war.

The delegates then approved a series of measures, including a Petition to the King in an appeal for peace and a Declaration and Resolves which introduced the ideas of natural law and natural rights, foreshadowing some of the principles found in the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights. The declaration asserted the rights of colonists and outlined Parliament&#x27;s abuses of power. Proposed by Richard Henry Lee, it also included a trade boycott known as the Continental Association. The Association, a crucial step toward unification, empowered committees of correspondence throughout the colonies to enforce the boycott. The Declaration and its boycott directly challenged Parliament&#x27;s right to govern in the Americas, bolstering the view of King George III and his administration under Lord North that the colonies were in a state of rebellion.

Lord Dartmouth, the secretary of state for the colonies who had been sympathetic to the Americans, condemned the newly established Congress for what he considered its illegal formation and actions. In tandem with the Intolerable Acts, British Army commander-in-chief Lieutenant General Thomas Gage was installed as governor of Massachusetts. In January 1775, Gage&#x27;s superior, Lord Dartmouth, ordered the general to arrest those responsible for the Tea Party and to seize the munitions that had been stockpiled by militia forces outside of Boston. The letter took several months to reach Gage, who acted immediately by sending out 700 army regulars. During their march to Lexington and Concord on the morning of April 19, 1775, the British troops encountered militia forces, who had been warned the night before by Paul Revere and another messenger on horseback, William Dawes. Even though it is unknown who fired the first shot, the Revolutionary War began.

=== Second Continental Congress (1775) ===
On May 10, 1775, less than three weeks after the Battles at Lexington and Concord, the Second Continental Congress convened in the Pennsylvania State House. The gathering essentially reconstituted the First Congress with many of the same delegates in attendance. Among the new arrivals were Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, John Hancock of Massachusetts, and in June, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. Hancock was elected president two weeks into the session when Peyton Randolph was recalled to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses as speaker, and Jefferson was named to replace him in the Virginia delegation. After adopting the rules of debate from the previous year and reinforcing its emphasis on secrecy, the Congress turned to its foremost concern, the defense of the colonies.

The provincial assembly in Massachusetts, which had declared the colony&#x27;s governorship vacant, reached out to the Congress for direction on two matters: whether the assembly could assume the powers of civil government and whether the Congress would take over the army being formed in Boston. In answer to the first question, on June 9 the colony&#x27;s leaders were directed to choose a council to govern within the spirit of the colony&#x27;s charter. As for the second, Congress spent several days discussing plans for guiding the forces of all thirteen colonies. Finally, on June 14 Congress approved provisioning the New England militias, agreed to send ten companies of riflemen from other colonies as reinforcements, and appointed a committee to draft rules for governing the military, thus establishing the Continental Army. The next day, Samuel and John Adams nominated Washington as commander-in-chief, a motion that was unanimously approved. Two days later, on June 17, the militias clashed with British forces at Bunker Hill, a victory for Britain but a costly one.

The Congress&#x27;s actions came despite the divide between conservatives who still hoped for reconciliation with England and at the other end of the spectrum, those who favored independence. To satisfy the former, Congress adopted the Olive Branch Petition on July 5, an appeal for peace to King George III written by John Dickinson. Then, the following day, it approved the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, a resolution justifying military action. The declaration, intended for Washington to read to the troops upon his arrival in Massachusetts, was drafted by Jefferson but edited by Dickinson who thought its language too strong. When the Olive Branch Petition arrived in London in September, the king refused to look at it. By then, he had already issued a proclamation declaring the American colonies in rebellion.

== Declaration of Independence (1776) ==

Under the auspices of the Second Continental Congress and its Committee of Five, Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence. It was presented to the Congress by the Committee on June 28, and after much debate and editing of the document, on July 2, 1776, Congress passed the Lee Resolution, which declared the United Colonies independent from Great Britain. Two days later, on July 4, the Declaration of Independence was adopted. The name &quot;United States of America&quot;, which first appeared in the Declaration, was formally approved by the Congress on September 9, 1776.

In an effort to get this important document promptly into the public realm John Hancock, president of the Second Continental Congress, commissioned John Dunlap, editor and printer of the &quot;Pennsylvania Packet&quot;, to print 200 broadside copies of the Declaration, which came to be known as the Dunlap broadsides. Printing commenced the day after the Declaration was adopted. They were distributed throughout the 13 colonies/states with copies sent to General Washington and his troops at New York with a directive that it be read aloud. Copies were also sent to Britain and other points in Europe.

== Fighting for independence ==
While the colonists were fighting the British to gain independence their newly formed government, with its Articles of Confederation, were put to the test, revealing the shortcomings and weaknesses of America&#x27;s first Constitution. During this time Washington became convinced that a strong federal government was urgently needed, as the individual states were not meeting the organizational and supply demands of the war on their own individual accord. Key precipitating events included the Boston Tea Party in 1773, Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride in 1775, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River was a major American victory over Hessian forces at the Battle of Trenton and greatly boosted American morale. The Battle of Saratoga and the Siege of Yorktown, which primarily ended the fighting between American and British, were also pivotal events during the war. The 1783 Treaty of Paris marked the official end of the war.

After the war, Washington was instrumental in organizing the effort to create a &quot;national militia&quot; made up of individual state units, and under the direction of the federal government. He also endorsed the creation of a military academy to train artillery offices and engineers. Not wanting to leave the country disarmed and vulnerable so soon after the war, Washington favored a peacetime army of 2,600 men. He also favored the creation of a navy that could repel any European intruders. He approached Henry Knox, who accompanied Washington during most of his campaigns, with the prospect of becoming the future Secretary of War.

=== Treaty of Paris ===
After Washington&#x27;s final victory at the surrender at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, more than a year passed before official negotiations for peace commenced. The Treaty of Paris was drafted in November 1782, and negotiations began in April 1783. The completed treaty was signed on September 3. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, John Jay and Henry Laurens represented the United States, while David Hartley, a member of Parliament, and Richard Oswald, a prominent and influential Scottish businessman, represented Great Britain.

Franklin, who had a long-established rapport with the French and was almost entirely responsible for securing an alliance with them a few months after the start of the war, was greeted with high honors from the French council, while the others received due accommodations but were generally considered to be amateur negotiators. Communications between Britain and France were largely effected through Franklin and Lord Shelburne who was on good terms with Franklin. Franklin, Adams and Jay understood the concerns of the French at this uncertain juncture and, using that to their advantage, in the final sessions of negotiations convinced both the French and the British that American independence was in their best interests.

== Constitutional Convention ==
Under the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation had no power to collect taxes, regulate commerce, pay the national debt, conduct diplomatic relations, or effectively manage the western territories. Key leaders – George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and others – began fearing for the young nation&#x27;s fate. As the Articles&#x27; weaknesses became more and more apparent, the idea of creating a strong central government gained support, leading to the call for a convention to amend the Articles.

The Constitutional Convention met in the Pennsylvania State House from May 14 through September 17, 1787. The 55 delegates in attendance represented a cross-section of 18th-century American leadership. The vast majority were well-educated and prosperous, and all were prominent in their respective states with over 70 percent (40 delegates) serving in the Congress when the convention was proposed.

Many delegates were late to arrive, and after eleven days&#x27; delay, a quorum was finally present on May 25 to elect Washington, the nation&#x27;s most trusted figure, as convention president. Four days later, on May 29, the convention adopted a rule of secrecy, a controversial decision but a common practice that allowed delegates to speak freely.

=== Virginia and New Jersey plans ===

Immediately following the secrecy vote, Virginia governor Edmund Randolph introduced the Virginia Plan, fifteen resolutions written by Madison and his colleagues proposing a government of three branches: a single executive, a bicameral (two-house) legislature, and a judiciary. The lower house was to be elected by the people, with seats apportioned by state population. The upper house would be chosen by the lower house from delegates nominated by state legislatures. The executive, who would have veto power over legislation, would be elected by the Congress, which could overrule state laws. While the plan exceeded the convention&#x27;s objective of merely amending the Articles, most delegates were willing to abandon their original mandate in favor of crafting a new form of government.

Discussions of the Virginia resolutions continued into mid-June, when William Paterson of New Jersey presented an alternative proposal. The New Jersey Plan retained most of the Articles&#x27; provisions, including a one-house legislature and equal power for the states. One of the plan&#x27;s innovations was a &quot;plural&quot; executive branch, but its primary concession was to allow the national government to regulate trade and commerce. Meeting as a committee of the whole, the delegates discussed the two proposals beginning with the question of whether there should be a single or three-fold executive and then whether to grant the executive veto power. After agreeing on a single executive who could veto legislation, the delegates turned to an even more contentious issue, legislative representation. Larger states favored proportional representation based on population, while smaller states wanted each state to have the same number of legislators.

=== Connecticut Compromise ===

By mid-July, the debates between the large-state and small-state factions had reached an impasse. With the convention on the verge of collapse, Roger Sherman of Connecticut introduced what became known as the Connecticut (or Great) Compromise. Sherman&#x27;s proposal called for a House of Representatives elected proportionally and a Senate where all states would have the same number of seats. On July 16, the compromise was approved by the narrowest of margins, 5 states to 4.

The proceedings left most delegates with reservations. Several went home early in protest, believing the convention was overstepping its authority. Others were concerned about the lack of a Bill of Rights safeguarding individual liberties. Even Madison, the Constitution&#x27;s chief architect, was dissatisfied, particularly over equal representation in the Senate and the failure to grant Congress the power to veto state legislation. Misgivings aside, a final draft was approved overwhelmingly on September 17, with 11 states in favor and New York unable to vote since it had only one delegate remaining, Hamilton. Rhode Island, which was in a dispute over the state&#x27;s paper currency, had refused to send anyone to the convention. Of the 42 delegates present, only three refused to sign: Randolph and George Mason, both of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts.

=== State ratification conventions ===
The U. S. Constitution faced one more hurdle: approval by the legislatures in at least nine of the 13 states. Within three days of the signing, the draft was submitted to the Congress of the Confederation, which forwarded the document to the states for ratification. In November, Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislature convened the first of the conventions. Before it could vote, Delaware became the first state to ratify, approving the Constitution on December 7 by a 30–0 margin. Pennsylvania followed suit five days later, splitting its vote 46–23. Despite unanimous votes in New Jersey and Georgia, several key states appeared to be leaning against ratification because of the omission of a Bill of Rights, particularly Virginia where the opposition was led by Mason and Patrick Henry, who had refused to participate in the convention claiming he &quot;smelt a rat&quot;. Rather than risk everything, the Federalists relented, promising that if the Constitution was adopted, amendments would be added to secure people&#x27;s rights.

Over the next year, the string of ratifications continued. Finally, on June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, making the Constitution the law of the land. Virginia followed suit four days later, and New York did the same in late July. After North Carolina&#x27;s assent in November, another year-and-a-half would pass before the 13th state would weigh in. Facing trade sanctions and the possibility of being forced out of the union, Rhode Island approved the Constitution on May 29, 1790, by a begrudging 34–32 vote.

=== New form of government ===
The Constitution officially took effect on , when the House and Senate met for their first sessions. On April 30, Washington was sworn in as the nation&#x27;s first president. Ten amendments, known collectively as the United States Bill of Rights, were ratified on December 15, 1791. Because the delegates were sworn to secrecy, Madison&#x27;s notes on the ratification were not published until after his death in 1836.

=== Bill of Rights ===

The Constitution, as drafted, was sharply criticized by the Anti-Federalists, a group that contended the document failed to safeguard individual liberties from the federal government. Leading Anti-Federalists included Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, both from Virginia, and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts. Delegates at the Constitutional Convention who shared their views were Virginians George Mason and Edmund Randolph and Massachusetts representative Elbridge Gerry, the three delegates who refused to sign the final document. Henry, who derived his hatred of a central governing authority from his Scottish ancestry, did all in his power to defeat the Constitution, opposing Madison every step of the way.

The criticisms are what led to the amendments proposed under the Bill of Rights. Madison, the bill&#x27;s principal author, was originally opposed to the amendments, but was influenced by the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, primarily written by Mason, and the Declaration of Independence, by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson, while in France, shared Henry&#x27;s and Mason&#x27;s fears about a strong central government, especially the president&#x27;s power, but because of his friendship with Madison and the pending Bill of Rights, he quieted his concerns. Alexander Hamilton, however, was opposed to a Bill of Rights believing the amendments not only unnecessary but dangerous:

Why declare things shall not be done, which there is no power to do ... that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?

Madison had no way of knowing the debate between Virginia&#x27;s two legislative houses would delay the adoption of the amendments for more than two years. The final draft, referred to the states by the federal Congress on September 25, 1789, was not ratified by Virginia&#x27;s Senate until December 15, 1791.
The Bill of Rights drew its authority from the consent of the people and held that,

Madison came to be recognized as the founding era&#x27;s foremost proponent of religious liberty, free speech, and freedom of the press.

== Ascending to the presidency ==
The first five U.S. presidents are regarded as Founding Fathers for their active participation in the American Revolution: Washington, John Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. Each of them served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

== Demographics and other characteristics ==
The Founding Fathers represented the upper echelon of political leadership in the British colonies during the latter half of the 18th century. All were leaders in their communities and respective colonies who were willing to assume responsibility for public affairs.

Of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and U.S. Constitution, nearly all were native born and of British heritage, including Scots, Irish, and Welsh. Nearly half were lawyers, while the remainder were primarily businessmen and planter-farmers. The average age of the founders was 43. Benjamin Franklin, born in 1706, was the oldest, while only a few were born after 1750 and thus were in their 20s.

The following sections discuss these and other demographic topics in greater detail. For the most part, the information is confined to signers/delegates associated with the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and Constitution.

=== Political experience ===
All of the Founding Fathers had extensive political experience at the national and state levels. As just one example, the signers of the Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation were members of Second Continental Congress, while four-fifths of the delegates at the Constitutional Convention had served in the Congress either during or prior to the convention. The remaining fifth attending the convention were recognized as leaders in the state assemblies that appointed them.

Following are brief profiles of the political backgrounds of some of the more notable founders:
* John Adams began his political career as a town council member in Braintree outside Boston. He came to wider attention following a series of essays he wrote during the Stamp Act crisis of 1765. In 1770, he was elected to the Massachusetts General Assembly, went on to lead Boston&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence, and in 1774, was elected to the Continental Congress. Adams later became the first vice president (1789–1797) and second president (1797–1801) of the nation he helped found.
* John Dickinson was one of the leaders of the Pennsylvania Assembly during the 1770s. As a member of the First and Second Continental Congress, he wrote two petitions for the Congress to King George III seeking a peaceful solution. Dickinson opposed independence and refused to sign the Declaration of Independence, but served as an officer in the militia and wrote the initial draft of the Articles of Confederation. In the 1780s, he served as president of Pennsylvania and president of Delaware and as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.
* Benjamin Franklin retired from his business activities in 1747 and was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1751. He was sent to London in 1757 for the first of two diplomatic missions on behalf of the colony. Upon returning from England in 1775, Franklin was elected to the Second Continental Congress. After signing the Declaration of Independence in 1776, he was appointed Minister to France and then Sweden, and in 1783 helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris. Franklin was governor of Pennsylvania from 1785 to 1788 and was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.
* John Jay was a New York delegate to the First and Second Continental Congress and in 1778 was elected Congress president. In 1782, he was summoned to Paris by Franklin to help negotiate the Treaty of Paris with Great Britain. As a supporter of the proposed Constitution, he wrote five of the Federalist Papers and became the first chief justice of the Supreme Court following the Constitution&#x27;s adoption. Minister to Spain
* Thomas Jefferson was a delegate from Virginia to the Second Continental Congress (1775–1776) and was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. He was elected the second governor of Virginia (1779–1781) and served as Minister to France (1785–1789). He later served as the first secretary of state (1790–1793), second vice president (1797–1801) and third president of the United States (1801–1809)
* Robert Morris had been a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly and president of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Committee of Safety. He was also a member of the Committee of Secret Correspondence and member of the Second Continental Congress. Under the Articles of Confederation he served as the minister of finance and served as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.
* Roger Sherman had served in the First and Second Continental Congresses, Connecticut House of Representatives and Justice of the Peace before attending the Constitutional Convention as a delegate. After the Constitution was ratified he served in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate representing his home state of Connecticut. He was the only Founder to sign all four of the major founding documents, the Continental Association, Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and the U.S. Constitution.

=== Education ===
More than a third of the Founding Fathers attended or graduated from colleges in the American colonies, while additional founders attended college abroad, primarily in England and Scotland. All other founders either were home schooled, received tutoring, completed apprenticeships, or were self-educated.

====American institutions====
Following is a listing of founders who graduated from six of the nine colleges established in the Americas during the Colonial Era. A few founders, such as Alexander Hamilton and James Monroe, attended college (Columbia and William &amp; Mary, respectively) but did not graduate. The other three colonial colleges, all founded in the 1760s, included Brown University (College of Rhode Island), Dartmouth College, and Rutgers University (Queen&#x27;s College).
* College of William &amp; Mary: Thomas Jefferson, John Blair Jr., James McClurg, James Francis Mercer, Edmund Randolph
* Columbia University (King&#x27;s College): John Jay, Robert R. Livingston, Gouverneur Morris,
* Harvard University (Harvard College): John Adams, Samuel Adams, Francis Dana, William Ellery, Elbridge Gerry, John Hancock, William Hooper, William Samuel Johnson (also Yale), Rufus King, James Lovell, Robert Treat Paine, Caleb Strong, Joseph Warren, John Wentworth Jr., William Williams
* Princeton University (The College of New Jersey): Gunning Bedford Jr., William Richardson Davie, Jonathan Dayton, Oliver Ellsworth, Joseph Hewes, William Houstoun, Richard Hutson, James Madison, Alexander Martin, Luther Martin, William Paterson, Joseph Reed, Benjamin Rush, Nathaniel Scudder, Jonathan Bayard Smith, Richard Stockton
* University of Pennsylvania (College of Philadelphia): Francis Hopkinson, Henry Marchant, Thomas Mifflin, William Paca, Hugh Williamson
* Yale University (Yale College): Andrew Adams, Abraham Baldwin, Lyman Hall, Titus Hosmer, Jared Ingersoll, William Samuel Johnson (also Harvard), Philip Livingston, William Livingston, Lewis Morris, Oliver Wolcott

==== British institutions ====
Following are founders who graduated from institutions in Britain:
* Inner Temple, is one of the four Inns of Court in London offering legal studies for admission to the English Bar: William Houstoun, William Paca (also University of Pennsylvania graduate)
* Middle Temple, also one of the four Inns of Court: John Banister, John Blair, John Dickinson, Thomas Heyward Jr., Thomas Lynch Jr. (also University of Cambridge graduate), John Matthews, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Peyton Randolph, John Rutledge
* University of Cambridge, England: Thomas Lynch Jr. (also Middle Temple graduate), Thomas Nelson Jr.
* University of Edinburgh, Scotland: Benjamin Rush, John Witherspoon

=== Ethnicity ===
All of the founders were white, and two-thirds (36 out of 55) were natives of the American Colonies, while nineteen were born in other parts of the British Empire.
* England: William Richardson Davie, William Duer, Button Gwinnett, Robert Morris, Thomas Paine
* Ireland: Pierce Butler, Thomas Fitzsimons, James McHenry, William Paterson, James Smith, George Taylor, Charles Thomson, Matthew Thornton
* Scotland: Edward Telfair, James Wilson, John Witherspoon
* Wales: Francis Lewis
* West Indies: Alexander Hamilton, Daniel Roberdeau

=== Occupations ===
While the Founding Fathers were engaged in a broad range of occupations, most had careers in three professions: about half the founders were lawyers, a sixth were planters/farmers, another sixth were merchants/businessmen, and the others were spread across miscellaneous professions.
* Ten founders were physicians: Josiah Bartlett, Lyman Hall, Samuel Holten, James McClurg, James McHenry (surgeon), Benjamin Rush, Nathaniel Scudder, Matthew Thornton, Joseph Warren, and Hugh Williamson.
* John Witherspoon was the only minister, although Lyman Hall had been a preacher prior to becoming a physician.
* George Washington, a Virginia planter, was a land surveyor before becoming a colonel in the Virginia Regiment.
* Benjamin Franklin was a successful printer and publisher and an accomplished scientist and inventor, in Philadelphia. Franklin retired at age 42 to focus first on scientific pursuits and then politics and diplomacy, serving as a member of the Continental Congress, first postmaster general, minister to Great Britain, France, and Sweden, and governor of Pennsylvania.

== Religion ==

Of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, 28 were Anglicans (Church of England or Episcopalian), 21 were other Protestants, and three were Catholics (Daniel Carroll and Fitzsimons; Charles Carroll was Catholic but was not a Constitution signatory). Among the non-Anglican Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists. 

A few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical, notably Jefferson. Historian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading founders (John Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid &quot;theistic rationalism&quot;. Many founders deliberately avoided public discussion of their faith. Historian David L. Holmes uses evidence gleaned from letters, government documents, and second-hand accounts to identify their religious beliefs.

==Founders on currency and postage==
Four U.S. founders are minted on American currency—Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington; Washington and Jefferson both appear on three different denominations.


==Political and cultural impact==
===Political rhetoric===
According to David Sehat, in modern politics: Everyone cites the Founders. Constitutional originalists consult the Founders&#x27; papers to decide original meaning. Proponents of a living and evolving Constitution turn to the Founders as the font of ideas that have grown over time. Conservatives view the Founders as architects of a free enterprise system that built American greatness. The more liberal-leaning, following their sixties parents, claim the Founders as egalitarians, suspicious of concentrations of wealth. Independents look to the Founders to break the logjam of partisan brinksmanship. Across the political spectrum, Americans ground their views in a supposed set of ideas that emerged in the eighteenth century.
But, in fact, the Founders disagreed with each other...they had vast and profound differences. They argued over federal intervention in the economy and about foreign policy. They fought bitterly over how much authority rested with the executive branch, about the relationship and prerogatives of federal and state government. The Constitution provided a nearly limitless theater of argument. The founding era was, in reality, one of the most partisan periods of American history.

===Holidays===

Independence Day (colloquially called the &quot;Fourth of July&quot;) is a United States national holiday celebrated yearly on July 4 to commemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the founding of the nation. Washington&#x27;s Birthday is also observed as a national federal holiday, and on April 13 Jefferson&#x27;s Birthday honors the US founder and president.

=== Media and theater ===

The Founding Fathers were portrayed in the Tony Award–winning 1969 musical &quot;1776&quot;, which depicted the debates over and eventual adoption of the Declaration of Independence. The stage production was adapted into the 1972 film of the same name. The 1989 film &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot;, which was filmed on location in Independence Hall, depicts the events of the Constitutional Convention. The writing and passing of the founding documents are depicted in the 1997 documentary miniseries &quot;Liberty!&quot;, and the passage of the Declaration of Independence is portrayed in the second episode of the 2008 miniseries &quot;John Adams&quot; and the third episode of the 2015 miniseries &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;. The Founders also feature in the 1986 miniseries &quot;George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation&quot;, the 2002–2003 animated television series &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;, the 2020 miniseries &quot;Washington&quot;, and in many other films and television portrayals.

Several Founding Fathers, Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison—were reimagined in &quot;Hamilton&quot;, a 2015 musical inspired by Ron Chernow&#x27;s 2004 biography &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;, with music, lyrics and book by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The musical won eleven Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

===Sports===
Several major professional sports teams in the Northeastern United States are named for themes based on the founders:
* New England Patriots (National Football League)
* New England Revolution (Major League Soccer)
* New York Liberty (Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association)
* Philadelphia 76ers (National Basketball Association)
* Washington Capitals (National Hockey League)
* Washington Nationals (Major League Baseball)

==Religious freedom==
Religious persecution had existed for centuries around the world and it existed in colonial America. Founders such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Patrick Henry, and George Mason first established a measure of religious freedom in Virginia in 1776 with the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which became a model for religious liberty for the nation. Prior to this, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Lutherans had for a decade petitioned against the Church of England&#x27;s efforts to suppress religious liberties in Virginia.

Jefferson left the Continental Congress to return to Virginia to join the fight for religious freedom, which proved difficult since many members of the Virginia legislature belonged to the established Church of England. While Jefferson was not completely successful, he managed to have repealed the various laws that were punitive toward those with different religious beliefs. Jefferson was the architect for separation of Church and State, which opposed the use of public funds to support any established religion and believed it was unwise to link civil rights to religious doctrine.

The United States Constitution, ratified in 1788, states in Article VI that &quot;no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States&quot;. Freedom of religion and freedom of speech were further affirmed as the nation&#x27;s law in the Bill of Rights. The 14th Amendment of 1868 provided all Americans with &quot;equal protection under the laws&quot; and thus applied the First Amendment restriction against limiting the free exercise of religion to the states.

Washington, a local leader of the Church of England, was also a strong proponent of religious freedom, He assured Baptists worried that the Constitution might not protect their religious liberties, that, &quot;... certainly, I would never have placed my signature to it.&quot; Jews also viewed Washington as a champion of freedom and sought his assurances that they would enjoy complete religious freedom. Washington responded by declaring America&#x27;s revolution in religion stood as an example for the rest of the world.

== Slavery ==
The Founding Fathers were not unified on the issue of slavery and continued to accommodate it within the new nation. Some were morally opposed to it and some attempted to end it in several of the colonies, but nationally, slavery remained protected. In her study of Jefferson, a slaveholder of 600 slaves, Annette Gordon-Reed notes ironically, &quot;Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for American freedom&quot;. As well as Jefferson, Washington and many other Founding Fathers were slaveowners; 41 of the 56 signers of the Declaration owned slaves. Some were conflicted by the institution, seeing it as immoral and politically divisive; Washington freed his slaves, in his will. Jay and Hamilton led the successful fight to outlaw the international slave trade in New York, with efforts beginning in 1777.
Thomas Jefferson included an anti slavery clause in his original draft of the Declaration of Independence:
&quot;He [King George] has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating &amp; carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian King of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought &amp; sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he has obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed again the Liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.&quot;
Founders such as Samuel Adams and John Adams were against slavery. Rush wrote a pamphlet in 1773 which criticized the slave trade, and slavery. Rush argued scientifically that Africans are not intellectually or morally inferior, and any apparent evidence to the contrary is only the &quot;perverted expression&quot; of slavery, which &quot;is so foreign to the human mind, that the moral faculties, as well as those of the understanding are debased, and rendered torpid by it.&quot; The Continental Association contained a clause which banned any Patriot involvement in slave trading.

Franklin, though a key founder of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, owned slaves whom he manumitted (released). While serving in the Rhode Island Assembly, in 1769 Hopkins introduced one of the earliest anti-slavery laws in the colonies. When Jefferson entered public life as a member of the House of Burgesses, he began as a social reformer by an effort to secure legislation permitting emancipation of slaves. &lt;includeonly&gt;Jefferson say&#x27;s &quot;In 1769, I became a member of the legislature…. I made one effort in that body for the permission of the emancipation of slaves, which was rejected&quot;, but the representatives of the Crown sought &quot;to direct our labors in subservience to [the mother country&#x27;s] interest…. and… the Royal negative closed the last door to every hope of amelioration.&quot;&lt;/includeonly&gt; Jay founded the New York Manumission Society in 1785, for which Hamilton became an officer. They and other members of the Society founded the African Free School in New York, to educate the children of free blacks and slaves. When Jay was governor of New York in 1798, he helped secure and signed into law an abolition law; fully ending forced labor as of 1827. He freed his slaves in 1798. Hamilton opposed slavery, as his experiences left him familiar with it and its effect on slaves and slaveholders, though he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife&#x27;s family, the Schuylers. Evidence suggests Hamilton may have owned a house slave and after the Jay Treaty was signed, Hamilton advocated that American slaves freed by the British during the war be forcibly returned to their enslavers. Henry Laurens, ran the largest slave trading house in North America. In the 1750s alone, his firm, Austin and Laurens, handled sales of more than 8,000 Africans. 

Slaves and slavery are mentioned indirectly in the 1787 Constitution. For example, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 prescribes that &quot;three-fifths of all other Persons&quot; are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and direct taxes. Additionally, in Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3, slaves are referred to as &quot;persons held in service or labor&quot;. The Founding Fathers made some efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end, or significantly reduce slavery, during and after the revolution. In 1782, Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed owners to free their slaves by will or deed. As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia. In the Ordinance of 1784, Jefferson proposed to ban slavery in all the western territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote. Partially following Jefferson&#x27;s plan, Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance, for lands north of the Ohio River. The international slave trade was banned in all states except South Carolina by 1800. In 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a federally enforced ban on the international slave trade, throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave. However, the domestic slave trade was allowed for expansion or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory.

===Reconstruction as a &quot;Second Founding&quot;===

According to Jeffrey K. Tulis and Nicole Mellow:The Founding, Reconstruction (often called &quot;the second founding&quot;), and the New Deal are typically heralded as the most significant turning points in the country&#x27;s history, with many observers seeing each of these as political triumphs through which the United States has come to more closely realize its liberal ideals of liberty and equality. 
Scholars such as Eric Foner have expanded the theme. Black abolitionists played a key role by stressing that freed blacks needed equal rights after slavery was abolished. Biographer David Blight states that Frederick Douglass, &quot;played a pivotal role in America&#x27;s Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.&quot; Constitutional provision for racial equality for free blacks was enacted by a Republican Congress led by Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner and Lyman Trumbull. The &quot;second founding&quot; comprised the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution. All citizens now had federal rights that could be enforced in federal court. In a deep reaction, after 1876 freedmen lost many of these rights and had second class citizenship in the era of lynching and Jim Crow laws. Finally in the 1950s the U.S., Supreme Court started to restore those rights. Under the leadership of Martin Luther King and James Bevel, the Civil Rights movement made the nation aware of the crisis, and under President Lyndon Johnson major civil rights legislation was passed in 1964–65, and 1968.

== Scholarly analysis ==

Historians who wrote about the American Revolution era and the founding of the United States government now number in the thousands. Their inclusion would go well beyond the scope of this article. Some of the most prominent ones, however, are listed below. While most scholarly works maintain overall objectivity, historian Arthur H. Shaffer notes that many of the early works about the American Revolution often express a national bias, or anti-bias. Shaffer maintains that this bias lends a direct insight into the minds of the founders and their adversaries respectively. He notes that any bias is the product of a national interest and prevailing political mood, and as such cannot be dismissed as having no historic value for the modern historian. Conversely, various modern accounts of history contain anachronisms, modern day ideals and perceptions used in an effort to write about the past and as such can distort the historical account in an effort to placate a modern audience.

===Early historians===
Several of the earliest histories of the founding of the United States and its founders were written by Jeremy Belknap, author of his three-volume work, &quot;The history of New-Hampshire&quot;, published in 1784.
* Henry Adams, grandson of John Quincy Adams, wrote a nine-volume work, &quot;The History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison&quot;, which is acclaimed for its literary style, documentary evidence, and first-hand knowledge of major figures during the early Revolutionary era.
* Rufus Wilmot Griswold authored &quot;Washington and the Generals of the Revolution&quot;, a two-volume work, in 1885.
* Albert Bushnell Hart, a Harvard University history professor, edited a 27-volume work, &quot;The American Nation: A History&quot;, published in 1904–1918.
* John Marshall, a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, published a two-volume biography of Washington in 1832, three years before his death.
* David Ramsay is regarded as one of the first major historians of the American Revolutionary War.
* Mercy Otis Warren, who wrote extensively about the Revolution and post-Revolution eras, published all her works anonymously until 1790.
* Mason Locke Weems authored the first biography of Washington in 1800, which includes the famed story about a young Washington cutting down a cherry tree.
* William Wirt wrote the first biography on Patrick Henry in 1805, but was accused for excessive praise of Henry.

===Modern historians===
Articles and books by these and other 20th- and 21st-century historians, combined with the digitization of primary sources such as handwritten letters, continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers:
* Ron Chernow won the Pulitzer Prize for his 2010 . His 2004 bestselling book &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; inspired the 2015 blockbuster musical of the same name.
* Douglas Southall Freeman wrote an extensive seven volume biography on Washington. Historian and George Washington biographer John E. Ferling maintains that no other biography for Washington compares to that of Freeman&#x27;s work.
* Dumas Malone is noted for his six-volume biography &quot;Jefferson and His Time&quot;, for which he received the 1975 Pulitzer Prize, and for his co-editorship of the 20-volume &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot;.

* Annette Gordon-Reed is an American historian and Harvard Law School professor. She is noted for changing scholarship on Jefferson regarding his alleged relationship with Sally Hemings and her children. She has studied the challenges faced by the Founding Fathers, particularly as it relates to their position and actions on slavery.
* Jack P. Greene is an American historian who specializes in colonial-era American history.
* David McCullough&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning 2001 book &quot;John Adams&quot; focuses on Adams, and his 2005 book, &quot;1776&quot; details Washington&#x27;s military history in the American Revolution and other independence events carried out by America&#x27;s founders.
* Peter S. Onuf and Jack N. Rakove have researched Jefferson extensively.

According to American historian Joseph Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says the founders, or the fathers comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s, such as Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun, the founders represented heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.

===Noted collections===
