<text>Aust is a small village in South Gloucestershire, England, about north of Bristol and about south west of Gloucester. It is located on the eastern side of the Severn estuary, close to the eastern end of the Severn Bridge which carries the M48 motorway. The village has a chapel, a church and a public house. There is a large area of farmland on the river bank, which is sometimes flooded due to the high tidal range of the Severn. Aust Cliff, above the Severn, is located about from the village. The civil parish of Aust includes the villages of Elberton and Littleton-upon-Severn.

==History==

===Overview===
Aust, on the River Severn, was at one end of an ancient Roman road that led to Cirencester. Its name, Aust, may be one of the very few English place-names to be derived from the Latin &quot;Augusta&quot;.

&quot;Augustin endeavoured to persuade the
Welsh clergy to join him in preaching the Gospel to the Teutonic invaders,
and held a meeting with them at or near Aust, on the Severn. But they
refused to acknowledge his authority, or even to hold communion with him,
and would not give up their peculiar usages with respect to the date of
Easter and the administration of Baptism&quot;
(&quot;The English Church in the Middle Ages&quot; by William Hunt)

The name of Aust is recorded in 793 or 794 as &quot;Austan&quot; (&quot;terram aet Austan v manentes&quot;) when it was returned to the Church of Worcester after having been taken by King Offa&#x27;s earl, Bynna. In Domesday, Aust Cliff was recorded as &quot;Austreclive&quot;, &quot;clive&quot; being a Middle English spelling of cliff. and the estate was held by Turstin FitzRolf in 1066. In 1368 the area was called &quot;Augst&quot;, &quot;the short unmistakable form of Augusta.

Historically Aust was a village and manor in the parish of Henbury.

===Aust church===
It was reported as a part of the church of Worcester&#x27;s Westbury on Trym estate in the Domesday book. About 1100 Winebaud de Ballon gave the church to the Abbey of St Vincent, Le Mans. In the 14th century, the chapel at Aust was part of the Church of Westbury.

The Lollard theologian John Wycliffe (died 1384) is by tradition said to have been prebend of Aust and to have preached there, yet Baker (1901) was unable to find any record of such an appointment in the diocesan registers at Worcester, which see held Aust for many centuries.

The existing church is dedicated to St John, and is mostly built in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The timber roofs and octagonal stone font date from the 15th century, and the western church tower, with an embattled parapet, was probably rebuilt in the Tudor period. The church contains several 18th-century marble memorial tablets, the earliest dated 1704 to Sir Samuel Astry. The whole church was restored in 1866 by the firm of Pope &amp; Bindon.

===Aust manor===
The estate at Aust was held from the Bishop of Worcester as part of the extensive feudal barony of Turstin FitzRolf who had acted as standard-bearer to William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. FitzRolf&#x27;s properties in Gloucestershire were held in capite, including Aust, reverted to the Crown and then were granted to Wynebald de Ballon from Maine. Wynebald had a holding at Caerleon on the River Usk near the manor of his brother Hamelin de Ballon of Abergavenny. Both brothers made significant donations to the Abbey of St Vincent at Le Mans, including Wynebald&#x27;s donation of the church of Aust.

A daughter of de Ballon married a man named de Newmarch, their son Henry held the estate of Aust in 1166. John, his son and heir, next held Aust. One of John&#x27;s daughters and co-heiress married Ralf Russell of Kingston Russell, who then held the estate.

It passed in moiety through generations of the Russell and then Dennis families, through Margret Russell who married Sir Gilbert Denys (died 1422) to her grandson Walt Dennis. The moiety was purchased by the Astry family, The other moiety of Aust was held by Roger de Acton and was eventually sold to the Astry family. Reportedly it came into the Astry family in 1652. It was passed through several generations and was sold several times. In 1801, it was owned by Sacheverell Sitwell of Derbyshire.

==Services and facilities==
The village is within a short walking distance of 24hr shops at nearby Severn View services (originally known as Aust Services), a small motorway service area operated by Moto on the M48 motorway near the Severn Bridge.The main building is a two-storey timber and stone construction. The service area was listed as the last-known (February 1995) whereabouts of former Manic Street Preachers band member Richey Edwards, officially presumed deceased since 2008.

The Severn Bridge, a suspension bridge opened as part of the M4 motorway (later renamed the M48) in 1966, crosses the Severn estuary between Aust and Beachley. It was the first Severn road crossing south of Gloucester, and took five years to construct at a cost of £8 million. It replaced the Aust Ferry.

The Aust Ferry passage across the Severn estuary between Aust and Beachley – later known as the Old Passage – was used from antiquity. In the 12th century, responsibility was granted to the monks of Tintern Abbey, and it continued to operate in subsequent centuries. From 1827, a regular steamboat ferry service was established, but it lost much of its trade when a rival service was set up downstream at New Passage in 1863, and when the Severn rail tunnel was opened in 1886. The growth of road traffic led to the re-establishment of a ferry between Aust and Beachley in 1926, carrying no more than 17 vehicles each time. Bob Dylan was photographed in 1966 standing outside the ferry ticket office, with the almost-completed Severn Bridge behind; the photo was used to publicise Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;No Direction Home&quot;. The ferry service closed when the Severn Bridge was opened in September 1966.

di Michele published her first book of poetry, &quot;Tree of August&quot;, in 1978. She traveled to Chile in 1987 as part of a literary cultural exchange. In 1990, she became a professor of English at Concordia University.

By 1995 di Michele had written six volumes of poetry. That year she published her first novel, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;. She continued to write and publish poetry, and in 2005 released a second novel, &quot;Tenor of Love&quot;.

In 2011 di Michele released &quot;The Flower of Youth: Pier Paolo Pasolini Poems&quot; which returns to the terror of WWII in Italy and the experiences of her family before she was born. It anticipates her next book of poetry on the post-war years, &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; in 2017.

In 2007 Guernica Editions published &quot;Mary di Michele: Essays on Her Works,&quot; edited by Joseph Pivato, which includes studies by ten literary critics and indicates the high regard for her literary production.
In 2024 her works are held in more than 1400 libraries.

<doc id="558550" wikidata="Q844833" url="?curid=558550" title="Wylie transliteration">
<text>Wylie transliteration is a method for transliterating Tibetan script using only the letters available on a typical English-language typewriter. The system is named for the American scholar Turrell V. Wylie, who created the system and published it in a 1959 &quot;Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies&quot; article. It has subsequently become a standard transliteration scheme in Tibetan studies, especially in the United States.

Any Tibetan language romanization scheme faces the dilemma of whether it should seek to accurately reproduce the sounds of spoken Tibetan or the spelling of written Tibetan. These differ widely, as Tibetan orthography became fixed in the 11th century, while pronunciation continued to evolve, comparable to the English orthography and French orthography, which reflect late medieval pronunciation.

Previous transcription schemes sought to split the difference with the result that they achieved neither goal perfectly. Wylie transliteration was designed to precisely transcribe Tibetan script &quot;as written&quot;, which led to its acceptance in academic and historical studies. It is not intended to represent the pronunciation of Tibetan words.

==Consonants==
The Wylie scheme transliterates the Tibetan characters as follows:

In Tibetan script, consonant clusters within a syllable may be represented through the use of prefixed or suffixed letters or by letters superscripted or subscripted to the root letter (forming a &quot;stack&quot;). The Wylie system does not normally distinguish these as in practice no ambiguity is possible under the rules of Tibetan spelling. The exception is the sequence &quot;gy-&quot;, which may be written either with a prefix &quot;g&quot; or a subfix &quot;y&quot;. In the Wylie system, these are distinguished by inserting a period between a prefix &quot;g&quot; and initial &quot;y&quot;. E.g. གྱང &quot;wall&quot; is &quot;gyang&quot;, while གཡང་ &quot;chasm&quot; is &quot;g.yang&quot;.

==Vowels==
The four vowel marks (here applied to the base letter ཨ) are transliterated:
When a syllable has no explicit vowel marking, the letter &quot;a&quot; is used to represent the default vowel &quot;a&quot; (e.g. ཨ་ = a).

==Capitalization==
Many previous systems of Tibetan transliteration included internal capitalisation schemes—essentially, capitalising the root letter rather than the first letter of a word, when the first letter is a prefix consonant. Tibetan dictionaries are organized by root letter, and prefixes are often silent, so knowing the root letter gives a better idea of pronunciation. However, these schemes were often applied inconsistently, and usually only when the word would normally be capitalised according to the norms of Latin text (i.e. at the beginning of a sentence). On the grounds that internal capitalisation was overly cumbersome, of limited usefulness in determining pronunciation, and probably superfluous to a reader able to use a Tibetan dictionary, Wylie specified that if a word was to be capitalised, the first letter should be capital, in conformity with Western capitalisation practices. Thus a particular Tibetan Buddhist sect (Kagyu) is capitalised &quot;Bka&#x27; brgyud&quot; and not &quot;bKa&#x27; brgyud&quot;.

==Extensions==
Wylie&#x27;s original scheme is not capable of transliterating all Tibetan-script texts. In particular, it has no correspondences for most Tibetan punctuation symbols, and lacks the ability to represent non-Tibetan words written in Tibetan script (Sanskrit and phonetic Chinese are the most common cases). Accordingly, various scholars have adopted &quot;ad hoc&quot; and incomplete conventions as needed.

The Tibetan and Himalayan Library at the University of Virginia developed a standard, EWTS—the Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme—that addresses these deficiencies systematically. It uses capital letters and Latin punctuation to represent the missing characters. Several software systems, including Tise, now use this standard to allow one to type unrestricted Tibetan script (including the full Unicode Tibetan character set) on a Latin keyboard.

Since the Wylie system is not intuitive for use by linguists unfamiliar with Tibetan, a new transliteration system based on the International Phonetic Alphabet has been proposed to replace Wylie in articles on Tibetan historical phonology.

<text>Live at the Rainbow is the first live video recorded by Iron Maiden on 21 December 1980 and released in 1981. It includes one of the band&#x27;s earliest concerts with guitarist Adrian Smith as well as a very early version of &quot;Killers&quot;, with lyrics that differ from the album version that would be released in 1981. Paul Di&#x27;Anno later claimed to have written the lyrics five minutes before going on stage that night. This has been debunked as the same lyrics were performed by the band at the Reading Festival in August 1980.

Due to technical problems, a sound line broke down halfway through the show. As a result, the audience were allowed to stay after the show to watch the band perform &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; again for the recording.

This concert is included on disc 1 of &quot;The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days&quot;.

In addition, the cuts &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Wrathchild&quot; from this video received heavy rotation on MTV during its first hours on the air.

<text>The A403 is a main road linking Bristol with the Severn Estuary. It runs from junction 1 of the M48 at Aust to the docks at Avonmouth. After the Severn Bridge was opened in 1966, the A403 was constructed in 1969 and 1970 to provide a direct route between the M4 motorway and Avonmouth. It is an important route for the local industries, allowing easy access between Wales and this part of England. It was financed by Gloucestershire County Council with a £387,000 grant from the Ministry of Transport and was initially known as the Avonmouth Aust Coast Road.

==Route==
The road is running through South Gloucestershire and the City of Bristol. Between the M4 at Aust and Pilning it replaced the B4055 on a realigned route. Between Pilning and Chittening it followed a new route beside the ICI Severnside plant, and from Chittening to Avonmouth it followed the route of an existing unclassified road, St Andrews Road. At Avonmouth it connects with the A4, leading to the Portway. The road disrupted local communities, with Pilning being split in two sections. It runs near the proposed Avonmouth and Severnside Enterprise Area, planned for expansion by Bristol City Council. When completed, the road will have a junction with the M49 motorway (Junction 1) reducing the amount of heavy traffic passing through local communities.

==Safety==
Around 8,000 vehicles a day use this road. Although this is relatively low, a high proportion of traffic consists of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs); over five times the average. The A403 has had a poor safety record with numerous accidents. A particular problem has been HGVs parked at laybys along the road obscuring the view ahead, leading to several fatalities. South Gloucestershire Council reduced the speed limit on their section to 50 mph in 2007. Bristol City Council have announced plans to install better facilities for cyclists along the road.

<doc id="558559" wikidata="Q880582" url="?curid=558559" title="Taylor &amp; Francis">
<text>Taylor &amp; Francis Group is an international company originating in England that publishes books and academic journals. Its parts include Taylor &amp; Francis, CRC Press, Routledge, F1000 Research and Dovepress. It is a division of Informa plc, a United Kingdom-based publisher and conference company.

==Overview==
===Founding===
The company was founded in 1852 when William Francis joined Richard Taylor in his publishing business. Taylor had founded his company in 1798. Their subjects covered agriculture, chemistry, education, engineering, geography, law, mathematics, medicine, and social sciences. Publications included the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;.

Francis&#x27;s son, Richard Taunton Francis (1883–1930), was sole partner in the firm from 1917 to 1930.

===Acquisitions and mergers===
In 1965, Taylor &amp; Francis launched Wykeham Publications and began book publishing. T&amp;F acquired Hemisphere Publishing in 1988, and the company was renamed Taylor &amp; Francis Group to reflect the growing number of imprints. Taylor &amp; Francis left the printing business in 1990, to concentrate on publishing. In 1998 it went public on the London Stock Exchange and in the same year bought its academic publishing rival Routledge for £90 million. Acquisition of other publishers has remained a core part of the group&#x27;s business strategy. It merged with Informa in 2004 to create a new company called T&amp;F Informa, since renamed back to &quot;Informa&quot;. Following the merger, T&amp;F closed the historic Routledge office at New Fetter Lane in London, and moved to its current headquarters in Milton Park, Oxfordshire.
In 2017, T&amp;F sold assets from its Garland Science imprint to W. W. Norton &amp; Company and then ceased to use that brand.
In 2017, after collaborating for several years, T&amp;F bought specialist digital resources company Colwiz. In January 2020, T&amp;F bought open research publishing platform F1000.

===Activities===
In 2018 Informa PLC reported that Taylor &amp; Francis publishes more than 2,700 journals, and about 7,000 new books each year, with a backlist of over 140,000 titles available in print and digital formats. It uses the Routledge imprint for its publishing in humanities, social sciences, behavioural sciences, law and education, and the CRC Press imprint for its publishing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

As the academic publishing arm of Informa, Taylor &amp; Francis Group accounted for 30.2% of group revenue and 38.1% of adjusted profit in 2017.
Taylor &amp; Francis is generally considered the smallest of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) publishers (Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor &amp; Francis). Informa (including the Taylor &amp; Francis imprint) was ranked by Simba Information as the leading global academic publisher in the areas of humanities and social sciences, in &quot;Global Social Science &amp; Humanities Publishing 2016-2020&quot;.

The company&#x27;s journals are delivered through the Taylor &amp; Francis Online website and its ebooks through the Taylor &amp; Francis website. Taylor &amp; Francis offers Open Access publishing options in both its books and journals.
Its digital content services include Routledge Handbooks Online,
the Routledge Performance Archive, and the Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism.

Taylor &amp; Francis is a member of several professional publishing bodies including the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM), the Association of Learned &amp; Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) and The Publishers Association (PA). 

Taylor &amp; Francis is a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include replacing plastic with responsibly-sourced paper packaging to mail journals and achieving CarbonNeutral® publication certification for their print books and journals.

The old Taylor and Francis logo depicts a hand pouring oil into a lit lamp, along with the Latin phrase &quot;alere flammam&quot; – &quot;to feed the flame [of knowledge]&quot;. The modern logo is a stylised oil lamp in a circle.

==Company figures==
The group has about 1,800 employees in at least 18 offices worldwide. Its head office is in Milton Park, Abingdon in the United Kingdom, with other offices in Stockholm, Leiden, New York, Boca Raton, Philadelphia, Kentucky, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Melbourne, Sydney, Cape Town, Tokyo and New Delhi.

Taylor &amp; Francis reported a mean 2017 gender pay gap of 24.2% for its UK workforce, while the median was 8%. The fact that the average pay for women is significantly worse than the median pay (compared to men&#x27;s) shows that women are underrepresented in the positions with the highest pay.

== Evaluation and controversies ==
As of May 2022, 836 Taylor &amp; Francis journals are listed in the Norwegian Scientific Index of which 753 have a rating of &quot;level 1&quot; (meets academic standard), 70 have a rating &quot;level 2&quot; (the highest level, indicating rigorous academic quality), one has a rating of &quot;level X&quot; (decision on rating in progress), and 13 have a rating of &quot;level 0&quot; (indicating non-academic quality).

Taylor &amp; Francis has faced criticism for its use of author licensing agreements, and several of their journals have been criticized or retracted papers due to concerns over review and publishing practices.

===Journal protests===
In 2013, the entire board of the &quot;Journal of Library Administration&quot; resigned in a dispute over author licensing agreements.

===Academic practices===
In 2016, &quot;Critical Reviews in Toxicology&quot; was accused by the Center for Public Integrity of being a &quot;broker of junk science&quot;. Monsanto was found to have worked with an outside consulting firm to induce the journal to publish a biased review of the health effects of its product &quot;Roundup&quot;.

In 2017, Taylor &amp; Francis was strongly criticized for removing the editor-in-chief of &quot;International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health&quot;, who accepted articles critical of corporate interests. The company replaced the editor with a corporate consultant without consulting the editorial board.

In 2017 as part of the Grievance studies affair hoax articles, the T&amp;F journal &quot;Cogent Social Sciences&quot; accepted one of &quot;The conceptual penis as a social construct&quot; that had previously been rejected by another Taylor &amp; Francis journal, &quot;Norma: International Journal for Masculinity Studies&quot;, which suggested the study would be a good fit for &quot;Cogent Social Sciences.&quot; When the authors announced the hoax, the article was retracted. In 2018, another Grievance studies affair article &quot;Human reactions to rape culture and queer performativity at urban dog parks in Portland, Oregon&quot; was published in &quot;Gender, Place &amp; Culture&quot;, which was also retracted later that year.

In December 2018, the journal &quot;Dynamical Systems&quot; accepted the paper &quot;Saturation of Generalized Partially Hyperbolic Attractors&quot; only to have it retracted after publication due to the Iranian nationality of the authors. The European Mathematical Society condemned the retraction and later announced that Taylor &amp; Francis had agreed to reverse the decision. Previous instances of Taylor &amp; Francis journals discriminating against Iranian authors were reported in 2013.

In 2022 there has been much debate about the Accelerated Publication service offered by Taylor &amp; Francis for some of its biomedical journals. For $7,000, a scientist can expedite the peer review process and be published in as few as three weeks.

===Manipulation of bibliometrics===
Self-citation is a practice that can inflate the seeming prestige of a journal or group. In 2020, six T&amp;F journals were found by analytics company Clarivate that exhibited unusual levels of self-citation, and as a consequence they were suspended from &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; and saw a drop in their journal impact factors. An April 2022 article in the T&amp;F journal &quot;Accountability in Research&quot; outlined some of the factors leading to consistent suspension from &quot;Journal Citation Reports.&quot;

=== Antitrust lawsuit ===
In September 2024, Lucina Uddin, a neuroscience professor at UCLA, sued Taylor &amp; Francis along with five other academic journal publishers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, alleging that the publishers violated antitrust law by agreeing not to compete against each other for manuscripts and by denying scholars payment for peer review services.

== AI rights controversy ==
In 2024, Taylor &amp; Francis was criticized after selling access to its authors&#x27; research to Microsoft as part of an AI partnership. The deal, which allows Microsoft non-exclusive access to content and data to improve AI systems, was made without informing or seeking consent from the authors whose work was involved. Academics expressed surprise and concern upon learning about the agreement, citing issues of transparency, fair compensation, and the potential impact on academic research. The Society of Authors raised concerns about publishers entering such deals without consulting creators, emphasizing the need to protect authors&#x27; rights and consider the broader implications for the creative industries.

<doc id="558561" wikidata="Q964721" url="?curid=558561" title="Pokémon Adventures">
<text>is a Japanese manga series based on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. The series is written by Hidenori Kusaka. was the illustrator for the first nine volumes. When Mato became ill and was unable to continue illustrating the series, Satoshi Yamamoto took over as the illustrator and still continues as the series&#x27; artist.

Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pokémon media franchise, once stated that the series is closest to how he imagined the universe of &quot;Pokémon&quot; to be.

&quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; is translated into English in North America by Viz Media. As of May 2024, 63 volumes have been released, along with mini-volumes collecting arcs from &quot;Black and White&quot; onwards. In Southeast Asia, Singapore publisher Chuang Yi was translating &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; into English, and continued to translate new volumes up to volume 41. The company, however, entered voluntary liquidation in early 2014 and translation stopped. Shogakukan Asia now handles the series in Singapore.

==Plot==
&quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; is divided into several story arcs known as chapters, representing each mainline generation as well as their remakes and enhanced editions. 16 chapters have been released as of August 2023.

Due to the serialization of &quot;Black 2 &amp; White 2&quot; chapter on hold and taking many years before being collected into a volume, the &quot;X &amp; Y&quot; and subsequent chapters of &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; were separately collected into mini-volumes. The rounds included in these mini-volumes were only ones that were published in the &quot;CoroCoro Ichiban&quot; magazine. Once the &quot;Black 2 &amp; White 2&quot; chapter ended in the regular volumes, the subsequent chapters started to be collected in that format as well. 

===&quot;Red, Green &amp; Blue&quot;===
The first story shows Red, the protagonist, who gets his Pokédex from Professor Oak to start on his Pokémon journey, collecting Pokémon and battling gym leaders for the eight coveted gym badges. He later meets his rival Blue who is Oak&#x27;s own grandson. Later in his journey, he encounters con artist Green , who sells him fake Pokémon items. She has stolen a Squirtle from Oak’s lab and has evolved it into a Wartortle.

Later, Oak had been kidnapped by Team Rocket to replace Blaine, a former Team Rocket scientist, and the townspeople of Pallet Town were also kidnapped due to their strange empathy for Pokémon. Red, Green and Blue arrive at Saffron City to take on the Team Rocket Admins—Koga, Lt. Surge, and Sabrina. They manage to defeat Team Rocket and save Oak. It is revealed that using 7 gym badges, Arcticuno, Zapdos, and Moltres will be fused after Green does, unaware of the results. Their fusion results in a Pokemon referred to as Zapmolcuno, which looks like the three Legendary Birds fused together at the body, having all three of their heads. Red, Green, and Blue then work together to defeat and split the bird apart. Red then travels to the Indigo Plateau to battle his rival Blue, having gained seven badges, but also prevails against the evil bio-weapon Mewtwo and Team Rocket&#x27;s leader and legendary missing Viridian Gym Leader, Giovanni, on the way. Green is confronted by Oak about stealing and is forgiven. Red later battles Blue in the Pokémon League Championships and emerges victorious, claiming the title of champion of the Pokémon League.

===&quot;Yellow&quot;===
Red has disappeared after receiving a challenge letter sent to him by Bruno of the Elite Four. They plan to lure him to them, and use him to get information on Giovanni’s whereabouts. They also need his Earth Badge. Only Red’s Pikachu, Pika, managed to escape, Red having been encased in ice. Yellow decided to go look for Red, as Red had helped her catch a Rattata to train her in the skills of battling.

Later, Yellow, Blaine, Blue, Green, Bill, Lt. Surge, Koga and Sabrina join forces to bring down the Elite Four together. They find out that Lance’s master plan was to use the Gym Badges and create an amplifying effect at Cerise Island to power up a mysterious Legendary Pokémon and destroy all humans in the world except themselves. They felt that humans and Pokémon were not meant to coexist. Red turned up later at Cerise Island to help Surge and Bill defeat Bruno. It is also revealed that Giovanni was the one who rescued Red from his ice coffin. Yellow battles Lance, but is losing until the other trainers send their power to Yellow, and with their combined strength, she manages to defeat Lance.

===&quot;Gold, Silver &amp; Crystal&quot;===
The third adventure is based on the &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot; versions of the game. It features the protagonists Gold, Silver and Crystal, and is centered mostly around the Johto region, with Gold as the point of view character.

Some parts from the story are based on Kusaka&#x27;s thoughts of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games, which includes weapon designs and the areas where wild Pokémon live. His main focus in manga is to create Pokémon that looks attractive so that readers would appreciate them more. He also tries to balance the number of Pokémon trainers and Pokémon in order to be faithful to the game.

During publication of the series, artist Mato fell sick leaving Kusaka to either cancel the series or select another artist. He decided to continue and chose Satoshi Yamamoto as Mato&#x27;s replacement. Yamamoto felt pressure during his debut as older fans criticized his art in comparison to Mato. When he started drawing he had little knowledge about Pokémon, but still he was focused in the drawing for the new protagonist, Crystal. After working for a year, he was surprised with Kusaka&#x27;s stories and wanted to make his pictures give a good impression. During the fourth story arc, Yamamoto mentioned that several of the disasters happening in the Hoenn region that he drew are based on his favorite horror and monster movies.

==Reception==
Japanese volumes from the series have been featured in the Japanese comic ranking various times. Viz&#x27;s first volumes edition from the manga, &quot;The Best of Pokémon Adventures&quot;, appeared on ICv2&#x27;s Top 20 Graphic Novels from April 2008. It also won the first Nickelodeon Magazine Comics Awards in the category &quot;Favorite Manga Series&quot;. Readers from Media Factory&#x27;s &quot;Da Vinci Denshi Navi&quot; magazine voted the series as the third manga they wanted to have an animated adaptation. By September 2014, the manga had over 12 million copies in circulation only in Japan. By August 2017, it had 28 million copies in circulation worldwide.

ICv2&#x27;s Nick Smith gave the first volume 3.5 stars out of 5, commenting that several of the parts from the manga make it more interesting than the anime, such as Team Rocket&#x27;s appearances or Pikachu&#x27;s rebelled personality. Although he still noted there was more violence in the manga than in the anime, he still recommended it for all ages. 

&quot;Volume 14&quot; charted at tenth on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Manga Best Seller list on the week ending August 6, 2011.

Tsunekazu Ishihara, CEO of The Pokémon Company, said &quot;I want every Pokémon fan to read this comic!&quot;

===Sales announcement mistake===
Southeast Asia publisher Shogakukan Asia announced in November 2016 that the manga had sold over 150 million copies worldwide. However, in December 2017, the illustrator Satoshi Yamamoto stated on his Twitter account that this was an error.

<doc id="558566" wikidata="Q917848" url="?curid=558566" title="Kells, County Meath">
<text>Kells (; ) is a town in County Meath, Ireland. The town lies off the M3 motorway, from Navan and from Dublin. Along with other towns in County Meath, it is within the commuter belt for Dublin, and had a population of 6,608 as of the 2022 census. It is best known as the site of Kells Abbey, from which the Book of Kells takes its name. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

==Name==
The settlement was originally known by the Irish name , later or , and it is suggested that the name &quot;Kells&quot; developed from this. An early name for a or fort at the settlement was , this fort probably being located in the centre of present-day Kells. From the 12th century onward, the settlement was referred to in English and Anglo-Norman as Kenenus, Kenelles, Kenles, Kenlis, Kellis and finally Kells. It has also been suggested that Kenlis and Kells come from an alternative Irish name, (meaning &#x27;Head Fort&#x27;). Kells, Kenlis and Headfort all feature in the titles taken by the Taylor family.

In 1929, became the town&#x27;s official name in both Irish and English. Following the creation of the Irish Free State, a number of towns were renamed likewise. has been the official Irish-language form of the place name since 1969. In 1993, &quot;Kells&quot; was re-adopted as the town&#x27;s official name in English.

==History==
Before Kells was a monastery, it was the site of a royal site inhabited by the High King Cormac mac Airt who moved his residence from the Hill of Tara, for what reasons scholars are yet not sure.

Kells was an important place on one of the five ancient roads that came out of Tara – this road being named and which ran from Tara to Rathcrogan, another royal site, in County Roscommon.

About 560 AD, Colmcille (later known as Columba) a prince of the royal house of the Northern Uí Néill family acquired Kells in recompense of a fault acted against him by his cousin the High King Diarmuid MacCarroll, who granted him the Dun (fortification) of Ceannanus to establish a Monastery.

The present monastery at Kells is thought to have been founded around 804 AD by monks from St Colmcille&#x27;s monastery in Iona who were fleeing Viking invasions.

In 1152, the Synod of Kells completed the transition of the Colmcille&#x27;s establishment from a monastic church to a diocesan church. A later synod reduced the status of Kells to that of a parish. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, Hugh de Lacy was granted the Lordship of Meath in 1182. The religious establishments at Kells continued to flourish under their Anglo-Norman overlords. In the fifteenth century the parish of St. Columba&#x27;s was granted to the Archdeacon of Meath and his successors.

Kells became a border town garrison of the Pale and was the scene of many battles between the Kingdom of Breifne and the Hiberno-Normans (who had heavily intermarried). From 1561 to 1801, the constituency of Kells returned two MPs to the Irish House of Commons. During the Irish rebellion of 1641, Kells was burned by the O&#x27;Reilly clan during their attacks on the Pale.

The period of the Great Famine saw the population of Kells drop by 38% as measured by the census records of 1841 and 1851. The Workhouse and the Fever Hospital were described as full to overflowing.

==Places of interest==
The Kells monastic site, including the Kells Round Tower, is associated with St Colmcille (also known as Columba), the Book of Kells, now kept at Trinity College Dublin, and the Kells Crozier, exhibited at the British Museum. The round tower and five large Celtic crosses can still be viewed today. Four of the crosses are in the churchyard of St Columba&#x27;s Church on the Monastic Site. The other Celtic cross was positioned in the middle of a busy crossroads until an accident involving a school bus. It now stands in front of a former courthouse. A roof protects the cross from the elements. A replica also stands safe from the elements inside the museum.
Close by the graveyard of St. Columba&#x27;s church stands a small stone roofed oratory, known as St. Colmcille&#x27;s House. This probably dates from the 11th century. Access to the monks&#x27; sleeping accommodation aloft is by ladder. This small rectangular building is positioned at one of the highest points in the town.

Just outside the town of Kells on the road to Oldcastle is the hill of Lloyd, named after Thomas Lloyd of Enniskillen, who camped a large Williamite army here during the wars of 1688–91 against the Jacobites. Here also stands a 30m high building called the Spire of Lloyd, which is an 18th-century lighthouse folly. The area around the tower has been developed as a community park (the People&#x27;s Park), and includes the Paupers&#x27; Grave. Mass is celebrated there annually, and the cemetery is a reminder of the workhouse and extreme poverty engendered by changes in farming practice in the 19th century and during the Great Famine.

==Population==
The population of Kells town, as of the 2022 census of Ireland, was 6,608. In the period between the 1996 and 2022 census, the population almost doubled.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Until the opening of the new motorway in June 2010, Kells stood as a busy junction town on the old N3 road with over 18,000 vehicles passing through the town each day. Kells was a renowned traffic bottleneck from both the N3 national primary route (Dublin, Cavan, Enniskillen and Ballyshannon) and N52 national secondary route (Dundalk, Tullamore and Nenagh) passing through the town centre. The new M3 motorway (opened June 2010) significantly reduces the journey time to Dublin, as well as the numbers of vehicles in the town.

===Bus===
Kells is served by a regular bus service run by Bus Éireann, the 109, 109A and 109X, which takes about 1.5 hours to Busáras in Dublin.
In October 2022 Bus Éireann&#x27;s Dundalk to Ardee route 167 was extended to Mullingar via Kells. There are several services daily in each direction.

===Railway===
The original Kells railway station, located on the Oldcastle branch line between Oldcastle and Drogheda via Navan, opened on 11 July 1853. It was closed for passenger traffic on 14 April 1958 and finally for all traffic on 1 April 1963.

&quot;Meath on Track&quot; are seeking reinstatement of the Navan railway link, and on to Dublin.

==Film==
&quot;The Butcher Boy&quot; was filmed at Headfort House. Other films set in Kells include the Oscar-nominated animated film &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot;.

The Hollywood actress Maureen O&#x27;Hara was a native of Kells. Her father Charles came from the town, although Maureen grew up in Dublin. Charles was born in a house at the bottom of Farrell Street in the town, a building that now houses a supermarket, carpet shop and apartments. She visited the town on 26 May 2012 to receive the freedom of the town and to unveil a bust in her honour.

==Events==
From 2014 - 2021, Kells was home to the documentary film festival, the &quot;Guth Gafa International Documentary Film Festival&quot;. 2021. Guth Gafa is now focusing in impact and outreach screenings of powerful social justice and human rights documentaries

Hay Festival Kells was home to Ireland&#x27;s only Hay Festival, which then transmuted into the current Hinterlands festival.

<text>HMCS &quot;Oakville&quot; was a Royal Canadian Navy which took part in convoy escort duties during the Second World War. She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war she was sold to the Venezuelan Navy. She was named after Oakville, Ontario.

==Background==

Flower-class corvettes like &quot;Oakville&quot; serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The &quot;corvette&quot; designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name &quot;flower&quot; was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Oakville&quot; was laid down by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. at Port Arthur on 21 December 1940 and was launched on 21 June 1941. She was commissioned into the RCN on 18 November 1941.

===Attempted capture and sinking of &quot;U-94&quot;===

On 28 August 1942, in the company of American warships and the corvettes and , &quot;Oakville&quot; was escorting a convoy off Haïti when she attacked the German submarine . The submarine, which had been on the point of attacking the convoy, was first spotted and bombarded by an American seaplane. Oakville dropped depth charges to force it to surface, and after bombarding it, rammed the submarine twice, sustaining minor damages to its hull. The submarine, struck by a depth charge on the surface, gave up the fight. A boarding party was dispatched to seize the vessel.

Eleven sailors, under the command of Commander Clarence King, including Sub Lieutenant Hal Lawrence, and Petty Officer A.J. Powell, leapt onto the deck of the crippled &quot;U-94&quot; and rushed toward the conning tower, which was riddled by shellfire.
After clearing away the dead bodies covering the hatchway, Lawrence and Powell headed below. They were then surprised by two Germans who emerged from an escape hatch. After ordering them back inside, the Canadians opened fire on the two men, who were dashing toward them.

The German crew surrendered reluctantly. Despite the danger of the U-boat sinking, Lawrence went searching for the Enigma machine and documents. But finding that &quot;U-94&quot; had been scuttled, he retraced his steps, having to swim to the ladder which led to the conning tower. After giving the order to abandon ship, Lawrence leapt into the water just before the submarine went down. The Allied sailors and the 26 German survivors were recovered by &quot;Oakville&quot; and the American destroyer .

==Post-war service==
&quot;Oakville&quot; was paid off from the RCN and decommissioned on 20 July 1945. She was sold in 1946 to Venezuela as &quot;Patria&quot;.

<text>Johann Kaspar Zeuss (or &quot;Zeuß&quot;, 22 July 1806 – 10 November 1856) was a German historian and founder of Celtic philology. He is credited with demonstrating that the Celtic languages belong to the Indo-European group.

==Life==
Zeuss was born in Kronach, Upper Franconia, and studied at the gymnasium of Bamberg. His parents wished him to enter the priesthood, but he chose a scholarly career, inclining particularly to historical and linguistic studies. He entered the University of Munich and after graduating, taught at the gymnasium there. In 1837 his book &quot;Die Herkunft der Baiern von den Markomannen&quot; (The Descent of the Bavarians from the Markomans), brought him an honorary PhD from the University of Erlangen. The same year he went to Speyer to teach history at the lyceum and remained there until 1847, when he accepted a professorship of history at the University of Munich. This he resigned on account of poor health and was transferred to the lyceum in Bamberg. In 1853 there appeared his monumental &quot;Grammatica Celtica&quot;, which brought him fame. Two years after he took a leave of absence to recover his health, but he died in Kronach the following year.

== Influence ==
Zeuss was a scholar of great erudition, combining a knowledge of philology with history and ethnology. His Germanic studies had taught him the necessity of knowing Celtic languages, and he went to work to investigate this neglected field. To get at the sources, the old manuscripts, particularly those in Old Irish, he journeyed to Karlsruhe, Würzburg, St. Gallen, Milan, London, and Oxford, and everywhere made extracts or copies. Both ancient and modern dialects received his attention. His &quot;Grammatica Celtica&quot; proved beyond doubt that the Celtic languages were a group of the Indo-European family, which put Celtic philology on a sound scientific basis. After the author&#x27;s death, the work was revised and re-edited by Hermann Ebel (Berlin, 1871). Other works by Zeuss are &quot;Traditiones possessionesque Wirzenburgenses&quot; (1842) and &quot;Die Freie Reichstadt Speyer vor ihrer Zerstörung&quot; (The Free Imperial City of Speyer before its Destruction).

De Barra (2018, page 26) writes that Zeuss &quot;brought rigorous scientific methodologies and a sense of scholarly gravitas to the study of indigenous languages of Britain and Ireland...something the field had lacked before...in his wake universities in Britain and Europe devoted more resources to the study of Celtic matters&quot;.

John Lawrence) as a prisoner of war in Java (Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies) during World War II, as depicted in his books &quot;The Seed and the Sower&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Night of the New Moon&quot; (1970). It stars David Bowie, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Takeshi Kitano and Jack Thompson; Sakamoto also composed and played the musical score including the vocal version of the main theme &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;, with lyrics written and sung by David Sylvian.

The film was entered into the 1983 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or. Sakamoto&#x27;s score won the film a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.

==Plot==
In 1942, Captain Yonoi is the commander of the POW camp in Lebak Sembada in Japanese-occupied Java. A strict adherent to the bushido code, his only sources of connection to the prisoners lie in the empathetic Lt. Col. John Lawrence, the only inmate fluent in Japanese, and the abrasive spokesman Gp. Capt. Hicksley, who repeatedly resists Yonoi&#x27;s attempts to find weapons experts among the prisoners for the Japanese army&#x27;s interests. Lawrence has befriended Sgt. Gengo Hara, but remains at odds with the rest of the staff. Summoned to the military trial of the recently captured Major Jack Celliers, Yonoi is fascinated by his resilience and has him interned at the camp. After the trial, Yonoi confides in Lawrence that he is haunted with shame due to his absence during the February 26 Incident, believing he should have died alongside the rebels and implying that his focus on honour stems from this. Sensing a kindred spirit in Celliers, Yonoi&#x27;s fascination grows into a romantic obsession: he treats him specially, watches him sleep, and repeatedly asks Hara about him in private.

When the inmates are made to fast as punishment for insubordination during the forced seppuku of a guard (Okura), Celliers sneaks in food. The guards catch him and find a smuggled radio during the subsequent investigation, forcing him and Lawrence to take the blame. Yonoi&#x27;s batman, realizing the hold Celliers has on him, attempts to kill Celliers in his sleep that night, but fails after he wakes up and escapes, freeing Lawrence too. Yonoi catches Celliers and challenges him to a duel in exchange for his freedom, but Celliers refuses; the batman returns and kills himself for his failure, urging Yonoi to kill Celliers before his feelings overpower him.

At the funeral, Lawrence learns that he and Celliers will be executed for the radio, despite the lack of evidence, to preserve order in the camp; enraged, he trashes the funeral altar and is forced back into his cell. That night, Celliers reveals to Lawrence that as a teenager, he betrayed his younger brother, long bullied for his hunchback, by refusing to spare him a humiliating and traumatizing initiation ritual at their boarding school. Confronting his past, he describes the lifelong shame he felt towards his actions, paralleling Yonoi&#x27;s predicament. During their conversation, the pair are released by a drunken Hara, as a different prisoner confessed to delivering the radio. As they leave, Hara calls out in English, &quot;Merry Christmas, Lawrence!&quot; Although Yonoi is angry at Hara for exceeding his authority, he only mildly reprimands him.

Hicksley, realizing that Yonoi wants to replace him with Celliers as spokesman, confronts him. The two argue over their withholding of information from one another before an enraged Yonoi orders the whole camp to form up outside the barracks, including the sick bay&#x27;s ailing patients, resulting in one&#x27;s death. Hicksley, who refused to bring out the patients, is to be punished for his insubordination with an on-the-spot execution. Before he can be killed, Celliers breaks rank and kisses Yonoi on each cheek, choosing to save Hicksley&#x27;s life at the cost of his own. Caught between a desire for vindication and his feelings for Celliers, a distraught Yonoi collapses and is ultimately relieved from duty; the guards beat Celliers and drag him out of the area. His more rigid replacement has Celliers buried in the sand up to his neck and left to die. Before leaving, Yonoi sneaks into his pen and cuts a lock from his hair, moments before his death.

Four years later, Lawrence visits Hara, who is now a prisoner of the Allies. Hara has learned to speak English and reveals he is to be executed the following day for war crimes. Expressing confusion over the harshness of his sentence given how commonplace his actions were among both sides of the war, he and Lawrence both conclude that while the Allies officially won, morally &quot;we are all wrong.&quot; The two reminisce on Celliers and Yonoi, the latter of whom was reported to have been killed after the war, before bidding each other goodbye. As he is leaving, Hara calls out, &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence!&quot;.

==Production==

David Bowie was cast as Jack Celliers after director Nagisa Ōshima saw him in a production of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; on Broadway. He felt that Bowie had &quot;an inner spirit that is indestructible&quot;. While shooting the film, Bowie was amazed that Ōshima had a two- to three-acre camp built on the remote Polynesian island of Rarotonga, but most of the camp was never shot on film. He said Ōshima &quot;only shot little bits at the corners. I kind of thought it was a waste, but when I saw the movie, it was just so potent – you could &quot;feel&quot; the camp there, quite definitely.&quot; Bowie noted how Ōshima would give an incredible amount of direction to his Japanese actors (&quot;down to the minutest detail&quot;), but when directing him or fellow Westerner Tom Conti, he would say &quot;Please do whatever it is you people do.&quot; Bowie thought his performance in the film was &quot;the most credible performance&quot; he had done in a film up to that point in his career.

The boarding school sequence was shot on location at King&#x27;s College, a private high school in Auckland, New Zealand. In a shot of two students playing billiards, another boy in the room can be seen wearing a King&#x27;s blazer. Other scenes were filmed in various locations around Auckland including Auckland Railway Station.

Ōshima chose Ryuichi Sakamoto after seeing his photographs in a photo book &quot;Fifty Representative Figures of Today&quot;, and without even meeting him. The film was Sakamoto&#x27;s debut soundtrack just as it was his inaugural acting role. It was also Takeshi ‘Beat’ Kitano&#x27;s debut movie acting role, having only been known up to that point as a comedian on TV variety shows in Japan.

Contrary to usual cinematic practice, Ōshima shot the film without rushes and shipped the film off the island with no safety prints. &quot;It was all going out of the camera and down to the post office and being wrapped up in brown paper and sent off to Japan&quot;, said Bowie. Ōshima&#x27;s editor in Japan cut the movie into a rough print within four days of Ōshima returning to Japan.

On set, David Bowie made a bond with his on-screen brother, James Malcolm, whom he later called his “New Zealand brother”. For one pivotal scene, Malcolm had to sing for Bowie. The next year, Bowie invited Malcolm to join him on stage at Western Springs in Auckland for the Serious Moonlight Tour, where they released a dove together as a sign of peace.

<text>Zhelyu Mitev Zhelev (; 3 March 1935 – 30 January 2015) was a Bulgarian politician and former dissident who served as the first democratically elected and non-Communist President of Bulgaria, from 1990 to 1997. Zhelev was one of the most prominent figures of the 1989 Bulgarian Revolution, which ended the 35 year rule of President Todor Zhivkov. A member of the Union of Democratic Forces, he was elected as President by the 7th Grand National Assembly. Two years later, he won Bulgaria&#x27;s first direct presidential elections. He lost his party&#x27;s nomination for his 1996 reelection campaign after losing a tough primary race to Petar Stoyanov.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Zhelev was born in 1935 into a modest village family in Veselinovo in north-eastern Bulgaria. He studied philosophy at Sofia University, graduating in 1958 and gaining a PhD in 1974, a remarkable achievement given that he was under a cloud as a dissident, having been expelled from the Communist Party in 1965. After his expulsion he endured years of “social parasitism”, or unemployment in communist terminology, which he spent in virtual internal exile in his wife’s village, scraping a living from odd jobs on farms.

=== Dissident ===
Zhelev was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party, but was expelled from it for political reasons in 1965. He was unemployed for six years since all employment in Bulgaria was state-regulated.

In 1982, he published his controversial work, &quot;Fascism&quot; (Фашизмът). Three weeks after the volume&#x27;s publication in 1982, the book was removed from bookstores and libraries throughout the nation, as its description of the fascist states of Italy, Germany and Spain before, during, and after World War II made these regimes comparable to the Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc.

=== SDS ===
In 1988, just before the Fall of Communism, Zhelev founded the Ruse Committee, and in 1989 he became a founding member and chairman of the Club for Support of Openness and the Reform (a time when many such democratic clubs were formed), which helped him to achieve the position of Chairman of the Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgarian: СДС, SDS) party.

=== MP and President ===
Zhelev was elected MP in June 1990 for the 7th Grand National Assembly; the Assembly&#x27;s main goal was to create a new democratic Constitution of Bulgaria. After the resignation of President Petar Mladenov, the assembly elected Zhelev his successor on 1 August 1990. He thus became the first head of state in 44 years who was not either a Communist or fellow traveler.

=== 1992 presidential election ===
Under the new constitution adopted in July 1991, the president was to be elected directly by voters, for a maximum of two terms. The first such election was held in January 1992. Zhelev led the field in the first round, held on 12 January. He then won in the runoff a week later against Velko Valkanov (who was endorsed by the Socialists) with 52.8% of the votes to become Bulgaria&#x27;s first directly elected head of state. He immediately suspended his membership in the UDF. While the new constitution only barred him from serving in a leadership post with the party, he wanted to appear to be above politics. Since then, convention in Bulgaria calls for the president to not be a formal member of a political party during his term.

=== 1996 presidential election ===
Zhelev sought a second term in 1996, but lost the UDF nomination to eventual winner Petar Stoyanov.

=== Later political career ===
After his defeat in the 1996 UDF primaries and after the end of his presidency in 1997, Zhelev remained in politics, but on a much smaller scale. He became Honorary Chair of the Liberal Democratic Union and Honorary Chair of the Liberal International and in 1997 went on to establish and preside over a foundation named after him. Zhelev was the initiator and president of the Balkan Political Club, a union of former political leaders from Southeast Europe. As part of the club he voiced his support for Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union.

In 2009, Zhelev also voiced his opinion that Bulgaria should adopt a presidential system based upon the French model: &quot;The country should have both prime minister and president, but the latter should be vested in far-reaching powers so that he may control the executive power&quot;.

Zhelev died in Sofia at the age of 79 on 30 January 2015.

===World Justice Project===
Zhelyu Zhelev served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project (ABA).

== Family ==
He was married to Maria Zheleva (3 April 1942 – 8 December 2013) and has two daughters Yordanka (1963–1993) and Stanka (born 1966).
Zhelev has two grandchildren from his daughter Stanka.

==Awards and accolades==
On 15 January 2010, Zhelev received the Order 8-September for his contribution to the recognition of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia from the former Yugoslavia.

Zhelev Peak on Loubet Coast, Antarctica is named after Zhelyu Zhelev &quot;for his support for the Bulgarian Antarctic programme.&quot;

<text>Petar Živković (; 1 January 1879 – 3 February 1947) was a Serbian military officer and political figure in Yugoslavia. He was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 7 January 1929 until 4 April 1932.

==Life==

Petar Živković was born in Negotin, Principality of Serbia (present-day Bor District, Serbia) in 1879. He finished secondary school in Zajecar and the Military Academy in Belgrade.
A soldier at the Serbian court, he helped overthrow the Obrenović dynasty with the assassination of King Alexander I of Serbia (11 June), which was orchestrated by Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, the founder and leading member of the secret nationalist organization Black Hand. Živković later founded the secret organization White Hand in 1912, which served to counter the power of the Black Hand.
In 1921, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia appointed Živković commander of the Royal Guard, but he was briefly demoted due to accusations by a young guardsman that he tried to seduce him. In 1929 he was appointed prime minister as part of the 6 January Dictatorship. General Živković was Bogoljub Jevtić&#x27;s brother-in-law, the closest adviser to the head of State.

Živković held the office as a member of the Yugoslav Radical Peasants&#x27; Democracy (JRSD), which became the only legal party in Yugoslavia, following electoral reforms. As a prime minister he did not enjoy high regard by either the military or among other politicians not only due to his widely rumoured homosexuality. He resigned as prime minister in 1932, and shortly thereafter founded the Yugoslav National Party (JNS), becoming its president in 1936.

Following Alexander I assassination in 1934, His cousin Pavle Karađorđević took office as regent for the 11-year-old Petar II. Upon Pavle&#x27;s 1941 signing of the Tripartite Pact, Živković left Yugoslavia ahead of the Nazi invasion. He became part of the Yugoslav government in exile.

In 1946 he was tried in absentia in the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia at the Trial of Mihailović et al. and sentenced to death by the communist authorities. He was forced into exile, leaving for Italy and eventually settling in France, dying in Paris in February 1947, aged 68.

==In popular culture==

Živković is portrayed by Nebojša Dugalić in the Serbian television series &quot;Balkan Shadows&quot;.

<doc id="558596" wikidata="Q1815019" url="?curid=558596" title="Leigh syndrome">
<text>Leigh syndrome (also called Leigh disease and subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. It is named after Archibald Denis Leigh, a British neuropsychiatrist who first described the condition in 1951. Normal levels of thiamine, thiamine monophosphate, and thiamine diphosphate are commonly found, but there is a reduced or absent level of thiamine triphosphate. This is thought to be caused by a blockage in the enzyme thiamine-diphosphate kinase, and therefore treatment in some patients would be to take thiamine triphosphate daily. While the majority of patients typically exhibit symptoms between the ages of 3 and 12 months, instances of adult onset have also been documented.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of Leigh syndrome were classically described as beginning in infancy and leading to death within a span of several years; however, as more cases are recognized, it is apparent that symptoms can emerge at any age—including adolescence or adulthood—and patients can survive for many years following diagnosis. Symptoms are often first seen after a triggering event that taxes the body&#x27;s energy production, such as an infection or surgery. The general course of Leigh syndrome is one of episodic developmental regression during times of metabolic stress. Some patients have long periods without disease progression while others develop progressive decline.

Infants with the syndrome have symptoms that include diarrhea, vomiting, and dysphagia (trouble swallowing or sucking), leading to a failure to thrive. Children with early Leigh disease also may appear irritable and cry much more than healthy babies. Seizures are often seen, with reported prevalence of seizures in Leigh syndrome that ranges from 40% to 79%. Excess lactate may be seen in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood of a person with Leigh syndrome.

As the disease progresses, the muscular system is debilitated throughout the body, as the brain cannot control the contraction of muscles. Hypotonia (low muscle tone and strength), dystonia (involuntary, sustained muscle contraction), and ataxia (lack of control over movement) are often seen in people with Leigh disease. The eyes are particularly affected; the muscles that control the eyes become weak, paralyzed, or uncontrollable in conditions called ophthalmoparesis (weakness or paralysis) and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). Slow saccades are also sometimes seen. The heart and lungs can also fail as a result of Leigh disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of part of the heart muscle) is also sometimes found and can cause death; asymmetric septal hypertrophy has also been associated with Leigh syndrome. In children with Leigh-syndrome associated ventricular septal defects, caused by pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, high forehead and large ears are seen; facial abnormalities are not typical of Leigh syndrome.

However, respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with Leigh syndrome. Other neurological symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, loss of sensation in extremities caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system.

Hypertrichosis is seen in Leigh syndrome caused by mutations in the nuclear gene SURF1.

==Genomics==
Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and over 30 genes in nuclear DNA (gene &quot;SURF1&quot; and some COX assembly factors) have been implicated in Leigh disease.

Disorders of oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which cells produce their main energy source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), may be caused by mutations in either mtDNA or in nuclear encoded genes. The latter account for the majority of Leigh disease, although it is not always possible to identify the specific mutation responsible for the condition in a particular individual. Four out of the five protein complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are most commonly disrupted in Leigh syndrome, either because of malformed protein or because of an error in the assembly of these complexes. Regardless of the genetic basis, it results in an inability of the complexes affected by the mutation to perform their role in oxidative phosphorylation. In the case of Leigh disease, crucial cells in the brain stem and basal ganglia are affected. This causes a chronic lack of energy in the cells, which leads to cell death and in turn, affects the central nervous system and inhibits motor functions. The heart and other muscles also require a significant amount of energy and are affected by cell death caused by chronic energy deficiencies in Leigh syndrome.

===Mitochondrial DNA mutations===
Mitochondria are essential organelles in eukaryotic cells. Their function is to convert the potential energy of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in a process called oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria carry their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The information stored in the mtDNA is used to produce several of the enzymes essential to the production of ATP.

Between 20 and 25 percent of Leigh syndrome cases are caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. The most common of these mutations is found in 10 to 20 percent of Leigh syndrome and occurs in MT-ATP6, a gene that codes for a protein in the last complex of the oxidative phosphorylation chain, ATP synthase, an enzyme that directly generates ATP. Without ATP synthase, the electron transport chain will not produce any ATP. The most common MT-ATP6 mutation found with Leigh syndrome is a point mutation at nucleotide 8993 that changes a thymine to a guanine. This and other point mutations associated with Leigh syndrome destabilize or malform the protein complex and keep energy production down in affected cells. Several mitochondrial genes involved in creating the first complex of the oxidative phosphorylation chain can be implicated in a case of Leigh syndrome, including genes MT-ND2, MT-ND3, MT-ND5, MT-ND6 and MT-CO1.

Mitochondrial DNA is passed down matrilineally in a pattern called maternal inheritance—a mother can transmit the genes for Leigh syndrome to both male and female children, but fathers cannot pass down mitochondrial genes.

===Nuclear DNA mutations===
Nuclear DNA comprises most of the genome of an organism and in sexually reproducing organisms is inherited from both parents, in contrast to mitochondrial DNA&#x27;s maternal pattern of inheritance. Leigh syndrome caused by nuclear DNA mutations is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease, so two unaffected parents, each of whom carries one mutant allele, can have an affected child if that child inherits the mutant allele from both parents.

75 to 80 percent of Leigh syndrome is caused by mutations in nuclear DNA; mutations affecting the function or assembly of the fourth complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), cause most cases of Leigh disease. Mutations in a gene called SURF1 (surfeit1) are the most common cause of this subtype of Leigh syndrome. The protein that SURF1 codes for is terminated early and therefore cannot perform its function, shepherding the subunits of COX together into a functional protein complex. This results in a deficit of COX protein, reducing the amount of energy produced by mitochondria. SURF1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 9. Some types of SURF1 mutations cause a subtype of Leigh syndrome that has a particularly late onset but similarly variable clinical course. Another nuclear DNA mutation that causes Leigh syndrome, gene DLD, affects another protein complex in the mitochondria, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

Other nuclear genes associated with Leigh syndrome are located on chromosome 2 (BCS1L and NDUFA10); chromosome 5 (SDHA, NDUFS4, NDUFAF2, and NDUFA2); chromosome 8 (NDUFAF6), chromosome 10 (COX15); chromosome 11 (NDUFS3, NDUFS8, and FOXRED1); chromosome 12 (NDUFA9 and NDUFA12); and chromosome 19 (NDUFS7). SDHA is the only nuclear-coded protein present in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (as complex II), and Mitochondrial complex II deficiency, in its biallelic form, causes Leigh syndrome. Many of these genes affect the first oxidative phosphorylation complex.

===X-linked Leigh syndrome===
Leigh syndrome can also be caused by deficiency of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), the x-linked gene being PDHA1. In general, there are two major presentations of PDH deficiency, metabolic and neurologic, which occur at equal frequency. The metabolic form presents as severe lactic acidosis in the newborn period, and many die as newborns. Patients with the neurologic presentation are hypotonic (low muscle tone), feed poorly, lethargic, and develop seizures, mental retardation, microcephaly, blindness and spasticity secondary to contractures. &quot;Between these two extremes, there is a continuous spectrum of intermediate forms...A number of patients with primarily neurological symptoms fit into the category of Leigh&#x27;s syndrome.&quot;

X-linked recessive Leigh syndrome affects male children far more often than female children because they only have one copy of the X chromosome. Female children would need two copies of the faulty gene to be affected by X-linked Leigh syndrome.

===French Canadian Leigh syndrome===
The type of Leigh syndrome found at a much higher rate in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec is caused by a mutation in the LRPPRC gene, located on the small (&#x27;p&#x27;) arm of chromosome 2. Both compound heterozygosity and homozygous mutations have been observed in French Canadian Leigh syndrome. This subtype of the disease was first described in 1993 in 34 children from the region, all of whom had a severe deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the fourth complex in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Though the subunits of the protein found in affected cells were functional, they were not properly assembled. The deficiency was found to be almost complete in brain and liver tissues and substantial (approximately 50% of normal enzyme activity) in fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) and skeletal muscle. Kidney and heart tissues were found to not have a COX deficiency.

French Canadian Leigh syndrome has similar symptoms to other types of Leigh syndrome. The age of onset is, on average, 5 months and the median age of death is 1 year and 7 months. Children with the disease are developmentally delayed, have mildly dysmorphic facial features, including hypoplasia of the midface and wide nasal bridge, chronic metabolic acidosis, and hypotonia (decreased muscular strength). Other symptoms include tachypnea (unusually quick breathing rate), poor sucking ability, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and tremors. Severe, sudden metabolic acidosis is a common cause of mortality.

Estimates of the rate of genetic carriers in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region range from 1 in 23 to 1 in 28; the number of children born with the disease has been estimated at 1 in 2063 to 1 in 2473 live births. Genealogic studies suggest that the responsible mutation was introduced to the region by early European settlers.

==Pathophysiology==
The characteristic symptoms of Leigh syndrome are at least partially caused by bilateral, focal lesions in the brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and other regions of the brain. The lesions take on different forms, including areas of demyelination, spongiosis, gliosis, necrosis, and capillary proliferation. Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath around the axons of neurons, inhibiting their ability to communicate with other neurons. The brain stem is involved in maintaining basic life functions such as breathing, swallowing, and circulation; the basal ganglia and cerebellum control movement and balance. Damage to these areas therefore results in the major symptoms of Leigh syndrome—loss of control over functions controlled by these areas.

The lactic acidosis sometimes associated with Leigh syndrome is caused by the buildup of pyruvate, which is unable to be processed in individuals with certain types of oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies. The pyruvate is either converted into alanine via alanine aminotransferase or converted into lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase; both of these substances can then build up in the body.

==Diagnosis==
Leigh syndrome is suggested by clinical findings and confirmed with laboratory and genetic testing.

===Clinical findings===
Dystonia, nystagmus, and problems with the autonomic nervous system suggest damage to the basal ganglia and brain stem potentially caused by Leigh syndrome. Other symptoms are also indicative of brain damage, such as hypertrichosis and neurologically caused deafness. Laboratory findings of lactic acidosis or acidemia and hyperalaninemia (elevated levels of alanine in the blood) can also suggest Leigh syndrome. Assessing the level of organic acids in urine can also indicate a dysfunction in the metabolic pathway.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other diseases can have a similar clinical presentation to Leigh syndrome; excluding other causes of similar clinical symptoms is often a first step to diagnosing Leigh syndrome. Conditions that can appear similar to Leigh disease include perinatal asphyxia, kernicterus, carbon monoxide poisoning, methanol toxicity, thiamine deficiency, Wilson&#x27;s disease, biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), and some forms of encephalitis. Perinatal asphyxia can cause bilateral ganglial lesions and damage to the thalamus, which are similar to the signs seen with Leigh syndrome. When hyperbilirubinemia is not treated with phototherapy, the bilirubin can accumulate in the basal ganglia and cause lesions similar to those seen in Leigh syndrome. This is not common since the advent of phototherapy.

==Treatment==
Succinic acid has been studied, and shown effective for both Leigh syndrome, and MELAS syndrome. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet may be followed if a gene on the X chromosome is implicated in an individual&#x27;s Leigh syndrome. Thiamine (vitamin B1) may be given if pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is known or suspected. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are treated by supplementing the diet with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or sodium citrate, but these substances do not treat the cause of Leigh syndrome. Dichloroacetate may also be effective in treating Leigh syndrome-associated lactic acidosis; research is ongoing on this substance. Coenzyme Q10 supplements have been seen to improve symptoms in some cases.

Clinical trials of the drug EPI-743 for Leigh syndrome are ongoing.

In 2016, John Zhang and his team at New Hope Fertility Center in New York, USA, performed a spindle transfer mitochondrial donation technique on a mother in Mexico who was at risk of producing a baby with Leigh disease. A healthy boy was born on 6 April 2016. However, it is not yet certain if the technique is completely reliable and safe.

== Prognosis ==
Different genetic causes and types of Leigh syndrome have different prognoses, though all are poor. The most severe forms of the disease, caused by a full deficiency in one of the affected proteins, cause death at a few years of age. If the deficiency is not complete, the prognosis is somewhat better and an affected child is expected to survive 6–7 years, and in rare cases, to their teenage years.

==Epidemiology==
Leigh syndrome occurs in at least 1 of 40,000 live births, though certain populations have much higher rates. In the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of central Quebec, Leigh syndrome occurs at a rate of 1 in 2000 newborns.

==History==
Leigh syndrome was first described by Denis Leigh in 1951 and distinguished from similar Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy in 1954. In 1968, the disease&#x27;s link with mitochondrial activity was first ascertained, though the mutations in cytochrome c oxidase and other electron transport chain proteins were not discovered until 1977.

<text>Jan E. Conn (born 1952) is a Canadian geneticist and poet. She resides in Great Barrington, Massachusetts where she does research on mosquito genetics at the Wadsworth Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, New York State Department of Health in Albany, New York. She has also written six books of poetry.

==Biography==
Conn was born in Asbestos, Quebec and moved to Montreal at the age of 17. She received her Ph.D. in genetics from the University of Toronto in 1987. She has traveled to Guatemala, Venezuela, Florida, Vermont and Massachusetts, conducting research on insects that transmit pathogens. Before taking up her current work on population genetics of malaria-carrying mosquitoes in South America and Africa, she was a recognized expert on the genetics of Black fly (&quot;Simulium&quot;) species vectoring river blindness (onchocerciasis) in Central America.

===Poetry===
Conn has written several books of poetry, including &quot;Jaguar Rain: the Margaret Mee poems&quot;, inspired by the diaries and botanical art of Margaret Mee. She has won numerous awards and major travel grants related to poetry, including a CBC Literary Prize, the inaugural P.K. Page Founder’s Award, and a nomination for a Pushcart Prize in 2016. In 1987, her book &quot;The Fabulous Disguise of Ourselves&quot; was shortlisted for the Pat Lowther Award, as was &quot;South of the Tudo Bem Cafe&quot;, in 1991.

<doc id="558624" wikidata="Q2031756" url="?curid=558624" title="Daring-class destroyer (1949)">
<text>The &quot;Daring&quot; class was a class of eleven destroyers built for the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Constructed after World War II, and entering service during the 1950s, eight ships were constructed for the RN, and three ships for the RAN. Two of the RN destroyers were subsequently sold to and served in the Peruvian Navy (MGP). A further eight ships were planned for the RN but were cancelled before construction commenced, while a fourth RAN vessel was begun but was cancelled before launch and broken up on the slipway.

The &quot;Daring&quot;-class ships were both the largest and most heavily armed ships serving in Commonwealth navies to be classified as destroyers. They were intended to fill some of the duties of cruisers, which post WW2 were considered both expensive and obsolete by naval planners, and were briefly officially considered a hybrid type (Darings) before being rated as destroyers. They were also the last destroyers of the RN and RAN to possess guns instead of guided missiles as their main armament. They saw use during the Indonesian Confrontation and the Vietnam War.

The &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers were in service in the RN and RAN from the 1950s to the 1980s. Following decommissioning, two RN &quot;Daring&quot;s were sold to Peru, which operated one ship until 1993 and the other until 2007. One ship of the class is preserved: as a museum ship at the Australian National Maritime Museum.

The &#x27;Darings&#x27; were the largest destroyers then built (1949) for the RN, having a displacement of 3,820 tons, a length of , a beam of , and a draught of .

The &quot;Daring&quot;s were the last conventional gun destroyers of the RN, and were armed with the QF 4.5 inch /45 (113 mm) Mark V gun in three double mounts UD Mk.VI (later renamed simply Mark N6). The main armament was controlled by a director Mark VI fitted with Radar Type 275 on the bridge and a director CRBF (close range blind fire) aft with Radar Type 262 providing local control for &#x27;X&#x27; turret on aft arcs. Remote Power Control (RPC) was provided for the main armament. &quot;Daring&quot;s were capable of a rate of fire of 16 rounds per minute per gun, or about 100 rounds per minute overall.
They were designed to ship three twin 40 mm /60 Bofors mounts STAAG Mark II, but the midships one was later replaced by the lighter and more reliable twin Mount Mark V. This meant that the &#x27;Darings&#x27; could engage two targets at long range and two at close range under fully automatic radar directed-control, an enormous improvement over their predecessors. Two of the Australian &quot;Daring&quot;s were instead fitted with two twin and two single Bofors mounts. Type 293 was carried on the foremast for target indication.

Like the earlier , the &quot;Daring&quot;s had their machinery arranged on the &#x27;unit&#x27; principle, where boiler rooms and engine rooms alternated to increase survivability. The boilers utilised pressures and temperatures (, ) hitherto unheard of in the conservative Royal Navy, allowing great improvements in efficiency to be made without increasing weight. The wide spacing of the boilers resulted in widely spaced funnels. The forward funnel was trunked up through the lattice foremast (referred to as a mack) with the after funnel a stump amidships. Neither was provided with a casing, resulting in a curious, rather unappealing appearance, although the utility of the funnels was considered by some to enhance the overall appearance. Attempts were made to improve the appearance by adding a streamline case to the funnel, but this was later removed. Of note was a new design of bridge, breaking with a lineage going back to the H-class destroyer of 1936. 3/8-inch armour plating was added to the turrets, the bridge and the fire control cable runs.

==Construction==

===British===
The Royal Navy ships were built in two groups, one with the traditional DC electrical system (&quot;Daring&quot;, &quot;Dainty&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot; and &quot;Delight&quot;) and the remaining ships (&quot;Decoy&quot;, &quot;Diamond&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot;), with a modern AC system. They were known as the 2nd and 5th Destroyer Squadrons, respectively.

Two of the ships, &quot;Danae&quot; and &quot;Delight&quot;, were originally part of the , though only &quot;Delight&quot; (originally&quot;Ypres&quot;, then &quot;Disdain&quot;, before finally being renamed &quot;Delight&quot;) was commissioned.

They were to have been of all-welded construction, but &quot;Daring&quot;, &quot;Decoy&quot;, and &quot;Diana&quot; were built with a composite of welding and riveting.

===Australian===
The Royal Australian Navy initially ordered four &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers, which were to be named after the ships of the &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot; of World War II. The ships were modified during construction: most changes were made to improve habitability, including the installation of air-conditioning. The &quot;Daring&quot;s were also the first all-welded ships to be constructed in Australia.

The first Australian &quot;Daring&quot; was laid down in 1949. By 1950, it was already apparent that the Australian &quot;Daring&quot;s would not be completed on time, as the Australian dockyards were experiencing difficulty in keeping up with the construction schedule. To compensate for this, the RAN unsuccessfully attempted to purchase two of the &#x27;Darings&#x27; under construction in the United Kingdom, and considered acquiring ships from the United States Navy despite the logistical difficulties in supplying and maintaining American vessels in a predominately British-designed fleet. Only three ships were completed; , , and were commissioned between 1957 and 1959. By the time they were commissioned, the cost of each ship had increased from A£2.6 million to A£7 million.

===Cancelled ships===
Eight further &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers ordered for the Royal Navy were cancelled on 27 December 1945: &quot;Danae&quot;, &quot;Decoy&quot;, &quot;Delight&quot;, &quot;Demon&quot;, &quot;Dervish&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;Desperate&quot; and &quot;Diana&quot;. Consequently, the ships of this class originally ordered as &quot;Disdain&quot;, &quot;Dogstar&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Druid&quot; were renamed as &quot;Delight&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Decoy&quot; and &quot;Diana&quot; to perpetuate the names of the original D-class flotilla of the 1930s.

The fourth Australian &quot;Daring&quot;, to be named &quot;Waterhen&quot;, was laid down in 1952 but cancelled in 1954 and scrapped on the slipway. This was one of several cost-cutting measures to maintain a naval aviation force based around two aircraft carriers.

===Construction programme===

==British modifications==
In 1958, the &#x27;DC&#x27; group had their after torpedo tubes removed and replaced with a deck house providing additional accommodation facilities. This modification was made in the &#x27;AC&#x27; ships in 1959–1960. At the same time, the &#x27;ACs&#x27; had their STAAG mounts replaced with single-mount Mark 7 Bofors and had the director Mark VI replaced by the new director MRS-3 (medium range system) incorporating the Radar Type 903 for fire control. The Seacat missile launcher was fitted briefly to &quot;Decoy&quot; for acceptance trials in 1961, but it was later removed and never fitted to the rest of the &#x27;Darings&#x27; as had been envisaged.

Between 1962 and 1964, the &#x27;DC&#x27; group had their STAAG mounts replaced by the Mark V also, with the final set of torpedo tubes being removed at the same time. This group also had the director MRS-3 replace the Mark VI.

==Service and fate==
The class saw service with the RN from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, and with the RAN from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, with &quot;Vampire&quot; in service as a training ship until 1986. Several of the ships were involved in Cold War conflicts. &quot;Delight&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Vampire&quot; and &quot;Vendetta&quot; were involved in the Indonesian Confrontation. &quot;Vendetta&quot; also operated during the Vietnam War, the only Australian-built warship to fight in the conflict.

Only one ship of the class was lost. On the night of 10 February 1964, HMAS Voyager crossed the bows of the aircraft carrier and was rammed and sunk with the loss of 81 RAN personnel and one civilian contractor. &quot;Duchess&quot; was loaned to the RAN as a replacement for four years while replacements (two modified s) were constructed, and then sold to the RAN.

The British &#x27;Darings&#x27; received little modernisation, and were all decommissioned as obsolete and requiring crews that were too large compared with frigates in 1968–1970. Two of these, &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Decoy&quot;, were sold to the Peruvian Navy and renamed and respectively. These two ships were modernised, with &quot;Palacios&quot; serving until 1993, and &quot;Ferré&quot; decommissioning in 2007.

The RAN ships were modernised in the early 1970s at a cost of A$20 million, although modifications to &quot;Duchess&quot; were fewer than to her sister ships. &quot;Duchess&quot; and &quot;Vendetta&quot; remained in commission until the late 1970s, and &quot;Vampire&quot; was retained until 1986 as a training ship. The Australian &#x27;Darings&#x27; were replaced with the s, an American-built derivative of the guided missile destroyer. The training role of the &#x27;Darings&#x27; was first supplemented, then replaced, by . After decommissioning, &quot;Vampire&quot; became a museum ship at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney, the only ship of the class to be preserved.

An unidentified &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer played the fictional &quot;HMS &quot;Sherwood&quot;&quot; in the 1957 A. E. Matthews film comedy &quot;Carry On Admiral&quot;. There are a number of profile shots of the ship in Portsmouth dockyard, as well as detailed views above and below decks, and an interesting sequence showing the accidental firing of a torpedo at the admiral&#x27;s barge.

<text>Zibhebhu kaMaphitha Zulu (c. 1841–1904) (also called Usibepu/Ziphewu) was a Zulu chief. After the defeat of the Zulu Kingdom by the British, he attempted to create his own independent kingdom. From 1883 to 1884, he fought the Zulu king Cetshwayo, inflicting a series of defeats on him.

==Life==
Zibhebhu was a son of Maphita, son of Sojiyisa, son Jama, son of Ndaba. He belonged to Mandlakazi Royal Homestead. Zibhebhu was &quot;induna&quot; (chief) of the Mandlakazi.

Zibhebhu was made chieftain of one of the thirteen chiefdoms resulting from the First Partition of Zululand after the Anglo-Zulu War, The chiefdom was in northern Zululand, a hotbed of uSuthu, and the British General Wolseley thought that Zibhebhu&#x27;s rule there would help suppress them.

In 1882, after pleas from Cetshwayo, the British Foreign Office relented and restored eight of the central &quot;chiefdoms&quot; to Cetshwayo&#x27;s superintending control; however, in this Second Partition of Zululand Zibhebhu&#x27;s chiefdom in the north was expanded to include more uSuthu lands and Zibhebhu remained independent of Cetshwayo.

In March 1883, Zibhebu undertook to secure the kraals in his new territory, which were held by the local uSuthu. Despite some resistance, there were all successfully seized. The USuthu in the south took exception to this, and Makhoba kaMaphitha marched north with some 5,000 warriors to retake the kraals. The defending Mandlakazi, 1,500 warriors assisted by five or six Boers under Johannes Wilhelm Colenbrander, set an ambush in Msebe Valley near Nongoma. This confrontation became known as the Battle of Msebe, and over 1,000 of the uSuthu were killed, with estimates running as high as 4,000. The Mandlakazi suffered minor casualties, with only ten dead.

Both Zibhebhu and Dinuzulu befriended Boer mercenaries to help them in their claims. On the 22 July 1883, led by a small troop of mounted white mercenaries, Zibhebhu made a sudden descent upon Cetshwayo&#x27;s (near Ulundi) which was being rebuilt. The uSuthu there were surprised, some attempted a defence but were soon routed, and Zibhebhu&#x27;s forces destroyed the king&#x27;s kraal as well as the surrounding uSuthu kraals. Cetshwayo&#x27;s senior military staff including general Ntshingwayo Khoza were chased down and killed as they fled after losing the battle. Though wounded, Cetshwayo managed to escape to the White Mfolozi river and then took refuge with Sigananda in the Nkandla forest. After repeated pleas from the Resident Commissioner, Sir Melmoth Osborn, the king moved to Eshowe, where he died a few months later, possibly by poisoning.

Zibhebhu vied for the royal succession with another of Cetshwayo&#x27;s sons, Dinuzulu. On Cetshwayo&#x27;s death, Dinuzulu was left to fight for the succession, and with the help of General Louis Botha and Dinuzulu&#x27;s Volunteers defeated Zibhebhu and his army at the Battle of Ghost Mountain (also known as the Battle of Tshaneni).

Zibhebhu and Eckersley, a white trader, escaped by climbing the Lubombo mountain. In September 1884 Zibhebhu guided the remnant of the Mandlakazi, about 6,000 people, into the &quot;Reserve Territory&quot;; an area set aside by the British for Zulu not loyal to the Zulu royal house.

<text>Karl Waldemar Ziegler (; 26 November 1898 – 12 August 1973) was a German chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963, with Giulio Natta, for work on polymers. The Nobel Committee recognized his &quot;excellent work on organometallic compounds [which]...led to new polymerization reactions and ... paved the way for new and highly useful industrial processes&quot;. He is also known for his work involving free-radicals, many-membered rings, and organometallic compounds, as well as the development of Ziegler–Natta catalyst. One of many awards Ziegler received was the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1960 jointly with Otto Bayer and Walter Reppe, for expanding the scientific knowledge of and the technical development of new synthetic materials.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Karl Ziegler was born on 26 November 1898 in Helsa near Kassel, Germany and was the second son of Karl Ziegler, a Lutheran minister, and Luise Rall Ziegler. He attended Kassel-Bettenhausen in elementary school. An introductory physics textbook first sparked Ziegler&#x27;s interest in science. It drove him to perform experiments in his home and to read extensively beyond his high school curriculum. He was also introduced to many notable individuals through his father, including Emil Adolf von Behring, recognized for the diphtheria vaccine. His extra study and experimentation help explain why he received an award for most outstanding student in his final year at high school in Kassel, Germany. He studied at the University of Marburg and was able to omit his first two semesters of study due to his extensive background knowledge. His studies were interrupted however, as during 1918 he was deployed to the front as a soldier to serve in World War I. He received his Ph.D. in 1920, studying under Karl von Auwers. His dissertation was on &quot;Studies on semibenzole and related compunds&quot; which led to three publications.

===Career===

Karl Ziegler showed an eagerness for science at an early age. He progressed through schooling quickly receiving a doctorate from the University of Marburg in 1920. Soon after, he briefly lectured at the University of Marburg and the University of Frankfurt.

In 1926 he became a professor at the University of Heidelberg where he spent the next ten years researching new advances in organic chemistry. He investigated the stability of radicals on trivalent carbons leading him to study organometallic compounds and their application in his research. He also worked on the syntheses of multi-membered ring systems. In 1933 Ziegler published his first major work on large ring systems, &quot;Vielgliedrige Ringsysteme&quot; which presented the fundamentals for the Ruggli-Ziegler dilution principle.
In 1936 he became Professor and Director of the Chemical Institute (Chemisches Institut) at the University of Halle-Saale and was also a visiting lecturer at the University of Chicago. Ziegler, who was a Patron Member of the SS received the War Merit Cross 2nd Class in October 1940.

From 1943 until 1969, Ziegler was the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research (Max-Planck-Institut fur Kohlenforschung) formerly known as the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut fur Kohlenforschung) in Mülheim an der Ruhr as a successor to Franz Fischer.

Karl Ziegler was credited with much of the postwar resurrection of chemical research in Germany and helped found the German Chemical Society (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker) in 1949. He served as president for five years. He was also the president of the German Society for Petroleum Science and Coal Chemistry (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Mineralölwissenschaft und Kohlechemie), from 1954 to 1957.
In 1971, The Royal Society, London, elected him as a Foreign Member.

==Personal life==

In 1922, Ziegler married Maria Kurtz. They had two children, Erhart and Marianna. His daughter, Dr. Marianna Ziegler Witte was a doctor of medicine and married a chief physical of a children&#x27;s hospital (at that time) in the Ruhr. His son, Dr. Erhart Ziegler, became a physicist and patent attorney. In addition to his children, Karl Ziegler has five grandchildren by his daughter, and five by his son. At least one of his grandchildren, Cordula Witte, attended his Nobel Prize reception as there is a picture of the two of them happily dancing. Ziegler enjoyed traveling around the world with his family, especially on cruises. He even charted special cruises and airplanes for eclipse viewing. It was during a 1972 eclipse-viewing cruise with his grandson that Karl Ziegler became ill. He died a year later.

Ziegler and his wife were great lovers of the arts, particularly paintings. Karl and Maria would present each other with paintings for birthdays, Christmases, and anniversaries. They amassed a large collection of paintings, not necessarily of one particular period, but of paintings they enjoyed. Maria, being an avid gardener, particularly enjoyed flower paintings by Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Oskar Kokoschka, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Karl enjoyed pictures of the places that he and his wife called home, including pictures of Halle and the Ruhr valley. Forty-two images from their shared collection were incorporated into a foundation, bequeathed to the Mülheim Ziegler Art Museum.

As a man of many discoveries, Karl Ziegler was also a man of many patents. As a result of his patent agreement with the Max Planck Institute, Ziegler was a wealthy man. With part of this wealth, he set up the Ziegler Fund with some 40 million deutsche marks to support the institute&#x27;s research. Another namesake is the Karl-Ziegler-Schule, an urban high school that was founded on 4 December 1974, renaming a previously existing school. The school is located in Mülheim, Germany.

Karl Ziegler died in Mülheim, Germany on 12 August 1973; his wife died in 1980.

==Scientific advancements==
Throughout his life, Ziegler was a zealous advocate for the necessary indivisibility of all kinds of research. Because of this, his scientific achievements range from the fundamental to the most practical, and his research spans a wide range of topics within the field of chemistry. As a young professor, Ziegler posed the question: what factors contribute to the dissociation of carbon-carbon bonds in substituted ethane derivatives? This question was to lead Ziegler on to a study of free radicals, organometallics, ring compounds, and, finally, polymerization processes.

===Free radical compounds===
While still a doctoral student at University of Marburg, Ziegler published his first major article which showed how halochromic (R3C+Z−) salts could be made from carbinols. Previous work had left the impression that halochromic salts or free radicals (R3C•) required R to be aromatic. He was encouraged to try to synthesize similarly substituted free radicals, and successfully prepared 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylallyl in 1923 and pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl in 1925. These two compounds were much more stable than previous tri-valent carbon free radicals, such as triphenylmethyl. His interest in the stability of tri-valent carbon free-radical compounds brought him to publish the first of many publications in which he sought to identify the steric and electronic factors responsible for the dissociation of hexa-substituted ethane derivatives.

===Many-membered ring compounds===

Ziegler&#x27;s work with many-membered ring compounds also utilized the reactive nature of alkali metal compounds. He used strong bases such as the lithium and sodium salts of amines, to accomplish the cyclization of long-chain hydrocarbons possessing terminal cyano groups. The initially formed ring compound was then converted to the desired macrocyclic ketone product. Ziegler&#x27;s synthetic method, which included running reactions at high dilution to favor the intramolecular cyclization over competing intermolecular reactions, resulted in yields superior to those of existing procedures (Laylin): he was able to prepare large-ringed alicyclic ketones, C14 to C33, in yields of 60–80%. An outstanding instance of this synthesis was the preparation of muscone, the odiferous principle of animal musk by Leopold Ružička. Ziegler and co-workers published the first of their series of papers on the preparation of large ring systems in 1933. For his work in this area and in free-radical chemistry he was awarded the Liebig Memorial Medal in 1935.

===Organometallic compounds===

Ziegler&#x27;s work with free radicals led him to the organo compounds of the alkali metals. He discovered that ether scission opened a new method of preparing sodium and potassium alkyls, and found that these compounds could easily be converted to the hexa-substituted ethane derivatives. The nature of the substituent could be easily and systematically altered using this synthetic route by simply changing the identity of the ether starting material.

====Lithium alkyls====

Later, in 1930, he directly synthesized lithium alkyls and aryls from metallic lithium and halogenated hydrocarbons via metal–halogen exchange. This convenient synthesis spurred numerous studies of RLi reagents by others, and now organolithium reagents are one of the most versatile and valuable tools of the synthetic organic chemist. Ziegler&#x27;s own research on lithium alkyls and olefins was to lead directly to his discovery of a new polymerization technique some 20 years later.

====Living polymerization====

In 1927, he found that when the olefin stilbene was added to an ethyl ether solution of phenylisopropyl potassium, an abrupt color change from red to yellow took place. He had just observed the first addition of an organoalkali metal compound across a carbon-carbon double bond. Further work showed that he could successively add more and more of the olefinic hydrocarbon butadiene to a solution of phenylisopropyl potassium and obtain a long-chain hydrocarbon with the reactive organopotassium end still intact. Oligomers such as these were the forerunners of the so-called &quot;living polymers&quot;.

====Polyethylene====

Since Ziegler was working at the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research, ethylene was readily available as a byproduct from coal gas. Because of this cheap feedstock of ethylene and the relevance to the coal industry, Ziegler began experimenting with ethylene, and made it a goal to synthesize polyethylene of high molecular weight. His attempts were thwarted because a competing elimination reaction kept occurring causing an anomalous result: instead of ethylene being converted into a mixture of higher aluminum alkyls, its dimer, 1-butene, was almost the only product. It was reasoned that a contaminant must have been present to cause this unexpected elimination reaction, and the cause was eventually determined to be traces of nickel salts. Ziegler realized the significance of this finding; if a nickel salt could have such a dramatic influence on the course of an ethylene-aluminum alkyl reaction, then perhaps another metal might delay the elimination reaction. Ziegler and his student H. Breil found that salts of chromium, zirconium, and especially titanium did not promote the R2AlH-elimination but, instead, enormously accelerated the &quot;growth&quot; reaction. Simply passing ethylene, at atmospheric pressure, into a catalytic amount of TiCl3 and Et2AlCl dissolved in a higher alkane led to the prompt deposition of polyethylene. Ziegler was able to obtain high molecular weight polyethylene (MW &gt; 30,000) and, most importantly, to do so at low ethylene pressures. The Ziegler group suddenly had a polymerization procedure for ethylene superior to all existing processes.

====Ziegler–Natta catalyst====

In 1952, Ziegler disclosed his catalyst to the Montecatini Company in Italy, for which Giulio Natta was acting as a consultant. Natta denoted this class of catalysts as &quot;Ziegler catalysts&quot; and became extremely interested in their ability and potential to stereoregularly polymerize α-olefins such as propene. Ziegler, meanwhile concentrated mainly on the large-scale production of polyethylene and copolymers of ethylene and propylene. Soon the scientific community was informed of his discovery. Highly crystalline and stereoregular polymers that previously could not be prepared became synthetically feasible. For their work on the controlled polymerization of hydrocarbons through the use of these novel organometallic catalysts, Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

==Awards and honours==

Karl Ziegler received many awards and honors. The following highlights some of the most significant awards:
*Liebig-Denkmünze medal (1935); This medal was awarded by the present day German Chemical Society and is given to a German chemist for their outstanding accomplishments and creativity. Ziegler received the award because of his work in the synthesis of multi-membered ring systems and stable tri-valent carbon radicals.

<doc id="558639" wikidata="Q3241381" url="?curid=558639" title="Linda Tripp">
<text>Linda Rose Tripp (née Carotenuto; November 24, 1949 – April 8, 2020) was an American civil servant who played a prominent role in the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal of 1998. Tripp&#x27;s action in illegally and secretly recording Monica Lewinsky&#x27;s confidential phone calls about her relationship with President Bill Clinton caused a sensation with their links to the earlier &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot; lawsuit and with the disclosing of intimate details. Tripp maintained that her motives were purely patriotic, and she avoided a wiretap charge by agreeing to hand over the tapes.

She later claimed that her firing from the Pentagon at the end of the Clinton administration was vindictive, but the administration called it standard procedure for a political appointee.

From 2002, Tripp and her husband, Dieter Rausch, owned and ran a year-round holiday store, The Christmas Sleigh, in Middleburg, Virginia.

==Early life and career==
Tripp was born Linda Rose Carotenuto in Jersey City, New Jersey. She was the daughter of Albert Carotenuto, an Italian-American high school math and science teacher, and his wife, Inge Beckwith, a German woman whom he had met while he was an American soldier stationed in Germany. They divorced in 1968, after he had an affair with a fellow teacher and Linda severed all ties to him afterwards. Raised in the Whippany section of Hanover Township, she graduated from Hanover Park High School in East Hanover, New Jersey in 1968. She later worked as a secretary in Army Intelligence at Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1971, she married Bruce Tripp, a military officer with whom she had a son and a daughter. They divorced amicably in 1990.

A White House employee in the George H. W. Bush administration, she kept her job when Bill Clinton became president in 1993. Later, she was moved to a position in the White House Counsel&#x27;s office under Bernard Nussbaum and his deputy Vince Foster, and Tripp was the last person to see Vince Foster alive shortly before his suicide on July 20, 1993. During the summer of 1994, senior White House aides wanted Tripp removed from the White House and transferred her to the public affairs office in the Pentagon, which raised her salary by $20,000.

==Involvement in Clinton impeachment scandal==
Tripp became a close confidante of Monica Lewinsky, another former White House employee, while both were working in the Pentagon&#x27;s public affairs office. According to Tripp, who was about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they had known each other for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of the literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, began secretly recording phone conversations with Lewinsky and encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president.

Michael Isikoff from &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that, in August 1997, Tripp said that she had encountered Kathleen Willey coming out of the Oval Office &quot;disheveled&quot; and that &quot;her face red and her lipstick was off.&quot; Willey alleged that Clinton groped her. Clinton&#x27;s lawyer Robert S. Bennett said in the &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, &quot;Linda Tripp is not to be believed.&quot;

In January 1998, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton, that Lewinsky had submitted a false affidavit denying the relationship to the federal court in Arkansas in the &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot; lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to suborn Tripp&#x27;s perjury in that suit to conceal what she knew of the Clinton–Lewinsky relationship and of Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case. Jones&#x27; lawsuit, initially filed in April 1994 through her attorneys Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert K. Davis, eventually resulted in the landmark US Supreme Court decision in &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot; that held that sitting US presidents do not have immunity against civil lawsuits for acts done before they take office that are unrelated to the office.

Tripp also informed Starr of the existence of a navy blue dress that Lewinsky owned that was soiled with Clinton&#x27;s semen. During their friendship, Lewinsky had shown the dress to Tripp and said she intended to have it dry-cleaned. Tripp convinced her not to do so.

Based on Tripp&#x27;s tapes, Starr obtained approval from Attorney General Janet Reno and the special court overseeing the independent counsel to expand Starr&#x27;s investigation into the Clinton–Lewinsky relationship, look for potential incidents of perjury, and investigate Lewinsky for perjury and suborning perjury as a witness in the lawsuit that Paula Jones had brought against Clinton.

Eventually, both Clinton and Lewinsky had to appear before a grand jury to answer questions, but Clinton appeared via closed-circuit television. At the conclusion of Lewinsky&#x27;s interrogation, the jurors offered Lewinsky the chance to offer any last words. She said, &quot;I hate Linda Tripp.&quot;

===Indictment by Maryland===
Tripp was a resident of Hickory Ridge, while she made her surreptitious recordings of the conversations with Lewinsky, and 49 Democrats in the Maryland Legislature signed a letter to the state prosecutor to demand for Tripp to be prosecuted under Maryland&#x27;s wiretap law. Before the trial, the state court ruled that because of the immunity agreements that the independent counsel&#x27;s office had entered with Tripp, Lewinsky, and others, a substantial amount of the evidence that the prosecution had intended to use was inadmissible.

At a pre-trial hearing, the prosecution called Lewinsky as a witness to try to establish if her testimony against Tripp was untainted by the independent counsel&#x27;s investigation. However, the Maryland state court ruled that Lewinsky, who &quot;admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life,&quot; was not credible and that Lewinsky&#x27;s proposed testimony against Tripp was &quot;bathed in impermissible taint.&quot; As a result, all charges against Tripp were dismissed on May 26, 2000, when the prosecution decided not to proceed with the trial of the case.

===Arrest record controversy===
Tripp had been arrested in 1969 when she was 19 years old in Greenwood Lake, New York, on charges of stealing $263 in cash as well as a wristwatch worth about $600. The charges were dismissed before they could come to trial. Years later, Tripp answered &quot;no&quot; to the question &quot;Have you ever been either charged or arrested for a crime?&quot; on her form for a US Department of Defense security clearance. In March 1998, shortly before Tripp was scheduled to appear before the grand jury in the Lewinsky investigation, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Kenneth Bacon and his deputy, Clifford Bernath, leaked how Tripp had answered that question to Jane Mayer of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The Department of Defense then leaked other confidential information from Tripp&#x27;s personnel and security files to the news media. The Department of Defense inspector general investigated the leaks and found that Bacon and Bernath had violated the Privacy Act of 1974. The US Department of Defense inspector general concluded that both Bacon and Bernath should have known that the release of information from Tripp&#x27;s security file was improper.

===Termination from government employment===
On January 19, 2001, the last full day of the Clinton administration, Tripp was fired from her job in the Pentagon. She claimed that the firing was vindictive, but the Clinton administration said that all political appointees such as Tripp are normally asked to submit their resignation when a new administration takes over. Those who refuse to do so may be fired.

===Lawsuit and settlement===
Tripp sued the US Department of Defense and the US Department of Justice for releasing information from her security file and employment file to the news media in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974. On November 3, 2003, Tripp reached a settlement with the federal government. The settlement included a one-time payment of more than $595,000; a retroactive promotion; and retroactive pay at the highest salary for 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also received a pension and was cleared to work for the federal government again. Her rights to remain part of a class action against the government were preserved.

==Later years==
Tripp married the German architect Dieter Rausch in 2004. The couple lived in Middleburg, Virginia, where they owned and operated a German winter-themed holiday store, called the Christmas Sleigh.

In an appearance with Larry King on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on December 1, 2003, Tripp talked about living with breast cancer. On the subject of her successful invasion of privacy lawsuit against the federal government, Tripp said she actually came out behind financially because of attorneys&#x27; fees and the derailment of her government career. She also said her violations of Lewinsky&#x27;s privacy and the Clinton administration&#x27;s violations of her privacy were not equivalent, as the Clinton administration&#x27;s leaking of her employment history was illegal. She noted that although her wiretapping was also illegal, she was able to avoid prosecution for such by accepting immunity in exchange for her testimony.

In 2018, Tripp said that &quot;she was the victim of &#x27;a real high-tech lynching&#x27;&quot; (referencing a statement by Clarence Thomas made in 1991).

Tripp died after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer at the age of 70 on April 8, 2020. Later in December 2020, Tripp&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Basket of Deplorables: What I Saw Inside the Clinton White House&quot;, was posthumously published.

==Portrayals==
Tripp was portrayed by John Goodman in recurring &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches. Tripp had mixed feelings about the impression, saying she was amused by most of the sketches, but mentioning that at least one had hurt her feelings.

Tripp was portrayed by Sarah Paulson in the television series &quot;,&quot; which premiered on September 7, 2021, on FX.

<doc id="558642" wikidata="Q726382" url="?curid=558642" title="The Interpretation of Dreams">
<text>The Interpretation of Dreams () is an 1899 book by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in which the author introduces his theory of the unconscious with respect to dream interpretation, and discusses what would later become the theory of the Oedipus complex. Freud revised the book at least eight times and, in the third edition, added an extensive section which treated dream symbolism very literally, following the influence of Wilhelm Stekel. Freud said of this work, &quot;Insight such as this falls to one&#x27;s lot but once in a lifetime.&quot;

Dated 1900, the book was first published in an edition of 600 copies, which did not sell out for eight years. &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; later gained in popularity, and seven more editions were published in Freud&#x27;s lifetime.

Because of the book&#x27;s length and complexity, Freud also wrote an abridged version called &quot;On Dreams&quot;. The original text is widely regarded as one of Freud&#x27;s most significant works.

== Background ==

Freud spent the summer of 1895 at Schloss BelleVue near Grinzing in Austria, where he began the inception of &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. In a 1900 letter to Wilhelm Fliess, he wrote in commemoration of the place:

While staying at Schloss Bellevue, Freud dreamed his famous dream of &#x27;Irma&#x27;s injection&#x27;. He analyzed the dream as expressing an unconscious wish to be exonerated from his mishandling of the treatment of a patient in 1895. In 1963, Belle Vue manor was demolished, but today a memorial plaque with just that inscription has been erected at the site by the Austrian &quot;Sigmund Freud Society&quot;.

== Overview ==

Dreams, in Freud&#x27;s view, are formed as the result of two mental processes. The first process involves unconscious forces that construct a wish that is expressed by the dream, and the second is the process of censorship that forcibly distorts the expression of the wish. In Freud&#x27;s view, all dreams are forms of &quot;wish fulfillment&quot; (later in &quot;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&quot;, Freud would discuss dreams which do not appear to be wish-fulfillment). Freud states: &quot;My presumption that dreams can be interpreted at once puts me in opposition to the ruling theory of dreams and in fact to every theory of dreams...&quot;

Freud advanced the idea that an analyst can differentiate between the manifest content and latent content of a dream. The manifest content refers to the remembered narrative that plays out in the dream itself. The latent content refers to the underlying meaning of the dream. During sleep, the unconscious condenses, displaces, and forms representations of the dream content, the latent content of which is often unrecognizable to the individual upon waking.

Critics have argued that Freud&#x27;s theory of dreams requires sexual interpretation. Freud, however, contested this criticism, noting that &quot;the assertion that all dreams require a sexual interpretation, against which critics rage so incessantly, occurs nowhere in my &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. It is not to be found in any of the numerous editions of this book and is in obvious contradiction to other views expressed in it.&quot; Freud stated that &quot;[T]he interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.&quot;

=== Sources of dream content ===

Freud claimed that every dream has a connection point with an experience of the previous day. Though, the connection may be minor, as the dream content can be selected from any part of the dreamer&#x27;s life. He described four possible sources of dreams: a) mentally significant experiences represented directly, b) several recent and significant experiences combined into a single unity by the dream, c) one or more recent and significant experiences which are represented in the content by the mention of a contemporary but indifferent experience, and d) an internal significant experience, such as a memory or train of thought, that is invariably represented in the dream by a mention of a recent but indifferent impression.

Oftentimes people experience external stimuli, such as an alarm clock or music, being distorted and incorporated into their dreams. Freud explained that this is because &quot;the mind is withdrawn from the external world during sleep, and it is unable to give it a correct interpretation ...&quot; He further explained that our mind &quot;wishes&quot; to continue sleeping, and therefore will try to suppress external stimuli, weave the stimuli into the dream, compel a person to wake up, or encourage them to overcome it.

Freud believed that dreams were picture-puzzles, and though they may appear nonsensical and worthless on the surface, through the process of interpretation they can form a &quot;poetical phrase of the greatest beauty and significance.&quot;

==== Condensation, displacement, and representation in dreams ====

Dreams are brief compared to the range and abundance of dream thoughts. Through condensation or compression, dream content can be presented in one dream. Oftentimes, people may recall having more than one dream in a night. Freud explained that the content of all dreams occurring on the same night represents part of the same whole. He believed that separate dreams have the same meaning. Often the first dream is more distorted and the latter is more distinct. Displacement of dream content has occurred when manifest content does not resemble the actual meaning of the dream. Displacement comes through the influence of a censorship agent. Representation in dreams is the causal relation between two things. Freud argues that two persons or objects can be combined into a single representation in a dream (see Freud&#x27;s dream of his uncle and Friend R).

=== &quot;On Dreams&quot; ===

An abridged version called &quot;On Dreams&quot; was published in 1901 as part of Lowenfeld and Kurella&#x27;s &quot;Grenzfragen des Nerven und Seelenlebens&quot;. It was re-published in 1911 in slightly larger form as a book. &quot;On Dreams&quot; is also included in the 1953 edition and the second part of Freud&#x27;s work on dreams, Volume Five, &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams II and On Dreams&quot;. It follows chapter seven in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; and in this edition, is fifty-three pages in length. There are thirteen chapters in total and Freud directs the reader to &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; for further reading throughout &quot;On Dreams&quot;, in particular, in the final chapter. Immediately after its publication, Freud considered &quot;On Dreams&quot; as a shortened version of &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. The English translation of &quot;On Dreams&quot; was first published in 1914 and the second English publication in the James Strachey translation from 1952. Freud investigates the subject of &quot;displacement&quot; and our inability to recognize our dreams. In chapter VI, page 659, he states: &quot;It is the process of displacement which is chiefly responsible for our being unable to discover or recognize them in the dream-content&quot; and he considers the issue of displacement in chapter VIII, page 671 as: &quot;the most striking of the dream-work.&quot;

== Contents ==

The first edition begins:
Freud begins his book in the first chapter titled &quot;The Scientific Literature on the Problems of the Dream&quot; by reviewing different scientific views on dream interpretation, which he finds interesting but not adequate. He then makes his argument by describing a number of dreams which he claims illustrate his theory.

Much of Freud&#x27;s sources for analysis are in literature. Many of his most important dreams are his own — his method is inaugurated with an analysis of his dream &quot;Irma&#x27;s injection&quot; — but many also come from patient case studies.

== Influence and reception ==

 &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; was first published in an edition of only 600 copies, and these took eight years to sell. The work subsequently gained popularity, and seven more editions were printed in Freud&#x27;s lifetime, the last in 1929.

The classicist Norman O. Brown described &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; as one of the great applications and extensions of the Socratic maxim &quot;know thyself&quot; in &quot;Life Against Death&quot; (1959). The philosopher Paul Ricœur described &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; as Freud&#x27;s &quot;first great book&quot; in &quot;Freud and Philosophy&quot; (1965). He argued that like Freud&#x27;s other works it posits a &quot;semantics of desire&quot;. The mythologist Joseph Campbell described the book as an &quot;epochal work&quot;, noting in &quot;The Masks of God: Creative Mythology&quot; (1968) that it was &quot;based on insights derived from years devoted to the fantasies of neurotics&quot;. Max Schur, Freud&#x27;s physician and friend, provided evidence in &quot;Freud: Living and Dying&quot; (1972) that the first dream that Freud analyzed, his so-called &quot;Irma dream&quot;, was not very disguised, but actually closely portrayed a medical disaster of Emma Eckstein, one of Freud&#x27;s patients. The psychologist Hans Eysenck argued in &quot;Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire&quot; (1985) that the dreams Freud cites actually disprove Freud&#x27;s dream theory.

The philosopher John Forrester described &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; as Freud&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot; in &quot;Dispatches from the Freud Wars&quot; (1997). He suggested that the book could be considered a form of autobiographical writing and compared it to the naturalist Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859). The philosopher Dermot Moran compared the influence that &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; exerted on psychoanalysis to that which the philosopher Edmund Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Logical Investigations&quot; (1900–1901) exerted on 20th-century European philosophy in his introduction to the latter work.

The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani noted in &quot;The Freud Files&quot; (2012) that the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler wrote to Freud in October 1905 that he was convinced of the correctness of &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; as soon as he read it. They argued, however, that Freud&#x27;s analysis of the dream of Irma&#x27;s injection was partly based on Belgian psychologist Joseph Delboeuf&#x27;s analysis of a dream in &quot;Sleep and Dreams&quot;. In their view, &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; should be placed in the context of the &quot;introspective hypnotism&quot; practiced by figures such as Auguste Forel, Eugen Bleuler, and Oskar Vogt. They charged Freud with selectively citing some authors on dreams (including Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d&#x27;Hervey de Saint Denys and Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury), ignoring others (including Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Janet, and Richard von Krafft-Ebing), and systematically avoiding &quot;citing the passages in the works of his predecessors which came closest to his own theories.&quot;

E. James Lieberman and Robert Kramer wrote in an introduction to a collection of letters between Freud and the psychoanalyst Otto Rank that Rank was impressed by &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; when he read it in 1905, and was moved to write a critical reanalysis of one of Freud&#x27;s own dreams. They suggested that it may have been partly this reanalysis that brought Rank to Freud&#x27;s attention. They noted that it was with Rank&#x27;s help that Freud published the second edition of &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; in 1909. Art historian and filmmaker Joseph Koerner drew the title of his 2019 film &quot;The Burning Child&quot; from a dream of that title, which opens Chapter 7 of &quot;Interpretation of Dreams.&quot; The album packaging for the 2002 David Bowie album &#x27;Heathen&#x27; contains an image of the book.

== Translations ==
The first translation from German into English was completed by A. A. Brill, a Freudian psychoanalyst. Years later, an authorized translation by James Strachey was published. A new translation of the first edition by Joyce Crick was published in 1999. The most recent English translation by J. A. Underwood is titled “Interpreting Dreams” and was published in 2006.

<text>Santos Dumont (formerly known as Palmira) is a municipality in southern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The population (2020) is estimated to be 46,421 and the total area of the municipality is . It lies at an elevation of just off the main interstate highway, BR040, between the urban centers of Barbacena (north) and Juiz de Fora (south). It is from the state capital, Belo Horizonte, and from Rio de Janeiro. It became a city in 1889.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The average annual temperature is approximately , with the average maximum of , and the average minimum of .

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
Livestock raising is the main economic activity with approximately 30,000 head of cattle and an annual production of milk of about .

The region produces corn, strawberries, guava, nectaries, manioc, beans, oranges, coffee, peach and banana.

===Industry===
Santos Dumont has the Companhia Brasileira de Carbureto de Cálcio, (CBCC), which produces silicone iron and metallic silicone, exporting to several countries.

==History==
Santos Dumont is the birthplace of aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont and is named in his honour. Prior to the renaming the city was known as &quot;Palmira&quot;. The Cabangu museum, located from the centre of the city () is dedicated to his memory. It is located in the house where he was born and has personal objects, photos and an aviation museum.

==Demographics==
Since the 1980s the municipality has been experiencing a period of slight demographic standstill. Between the census held in 1996 and the census held in 2000 the population increased at the rate of 0.32% per annum which is much lower than other places in the country. This is partially explained by the economic attraction of the nearby city of Juiz de Fora, making it the destination of many immigrants.

According to the 2000 census, the average income of the workers of the municipality was calculated at R$450 (237 USD at that time), but workers earning less than the national minimum wage (R$151, 80 USD) accounted for 38.8% of the total employees, meanwhile only 1.00% of them earned more than the equivalent to 20 minimum wages (R$3,020 or 1,590 USD).

== Tourism ==

There are 10 Kilometers of road until the division with the town of Antônio Carlos. During the route, it is possible to observe a nice natural landscape, old farms and two fountains, from the time of their construction, also well some rock records. Theses fountains were used for a parade of drovers while came from the interior of Minas Gerais, bringing gold to Rio de Janeiro, at the time of Colonial Brazil.

Besides that, in the city stand out the Cabangu Museum birthplace of Alberto Santos Dumont, in the district of Mantiqueira, 16 km from the city center.

The Ponte Preta Dam, in the neighborhood of Ponte Preta, allows leisure activities where people go swimming, boating, fishing, camping and spending the day free for leisure.

<text>In Aztec mythology, the &#x27; ( or &#x27;: the &quot;Four Hundred Mimixcoa&quot;, Cloud Serpents) are the gods of the northern stars. They are sons of Camaxtle-Mixcoatl with the Earth Goddess (Tlaltecuhtli or Coatlicue), according to the Codex Ramírez, or Tonatiuh (the Fifth Sun) with Chalchiuhtlicue, the goddess of the seas.

According to the &quot;Manuscript of 1558&quot;, section 6, these 400 &#x27;Cloud-Serpents&#x27; were divinely slain [transformed into stars] in this wise; of their five protagonists:
* (&#x27;Eagle&#x27;s Twin&#x27;) &quot;hid inside a tree&quot;; 
* (&#x27;Cloud Serpent&#x27;) &quot;hid within the earth&quot;; 
* (&#x27;Hawk Mountain&#x27;) &quot;hid within a hill&quot;; 
* (&#x27;River Lord&#x27;) &quot;hid in the water&quot;; 
* their sister, , &quot;hid in the ball-court.&quot;

From this ambuscade, these 5 slew the 400.

In Ce Tecpatl, after the Creation of the Fifth Sun in Teotihuacan, Camaxtle-Mixcoatl, one of the four gods, ascended to the Eighth Heaven and created four men and one woman to feed the Sun, but barely formed, they fell into the water, they returned to the sky and there was no war; frustrated by this attempt, Camaxtle struck a cane on a rock, and at the blow, 400 Chichimecs Mimixcoa sprouted that populated the earth before the Aztecs. Camaxtle was able to do penance on the rock, drawing blood with maguey spikes, tongue and ears, and prayed to the gods that the four men and one woman created in the eighth heaven would come down to kill the barbarians to feed to the Sun.

The four men and one woman created in the Eighth Heaven are the five Mimixcoa who would later sacrifice the 400 Mimixcoa called Chichimecs or Otomies.

In Ce Tecpatl, the Mimixcoa were born, their mother Iztac-Chalchiuhtlicue went into a cave (Chicomoztoc or Tlalocan) and gave birth to five other Mimixcoa called Cuauhtlicoauh, Mixcoatl, Cuitlachcihuatl, Tlotepe and Apantecuhtli. After spending four days in the water, the five Mimixcoa were suckled by Mecitli, who, by the text, identifies with the Earth Goddess (Tlaltecuhtli or Coatlicue), and, immediately, the Sun ordered the 400 Mimixcoa; the Sun, Tonatiuh, gives them arrows and says &quot;Here it is with what they will serve me to drink, with what they will feed, and a shield, and the precious arrows cast in quetzal feathers, in heron-rowing feathers, in feathers of zacuam, in tlauhquechol feathers, and in xiuhtototl feathers; and also, she, the Earth (Tlaltecuhtli or Coatlicue), who is your mother&quot;, but the Centzon Mimixcoa did not do their duty; instead, they get drunk on tzihuactli wine - a small maguey and have sex with women, and immediately, the Sun also orders the five who were born last, immediately gives them the maguey arrow and gives them the divine shield. The five Mimixcoa climb a mesquite tree where the 400 discover them, and they exclaim: &quot;Who are these who are such as us?&quot;, and then the five hide in specific places: Cuauhtlicoauh takes shelter in a tree, Mixcoatl on the ground, Tlotepe in the mount, Apantecuhtli in the water, and Cuitlachcihuatl in a court of the Tlachtli ball-court. Finally, the Centzon Mimixcoa are defeated by his five younger brothers, who served the Sun, Tonatiuh, and gave him a drink.

The Aztec gods of the southern stars are the , according to the Florentine Codex.

<text>Juan de Zumárraga, OFM (1468 – June 3, 1548) was a Spanish Basque Franciscan prelate and the first Bishop of Mexico. He was also the region&#x27;s first inquisitor. He wrote &quot;Doctrina breve&quot;, the first book published in the Western Hemisphere by a European, printed in Mexico City in 1539.

== Biography ==

=== Origins and arrival in New Spain ===
Zumárraga was born in 1468 or 1469 of a noble family, in Durango in the Biscay province in Spain. He entered the Franciscan Order, and in 1527 was custodian of the convent of Abrojo. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the judges of the court for the examination of witches in the Basque province. From his writings it would appear that he looked upon witches merely as women possessed of hallucinations.

By this time more detailed accounts of the importance of the conquest of Hernán Cortés began to be received, and on December 20, 1527, Zumárraga was recommended by Charles V for the post of first bishop of Mexico. Without having been consecrated and with only the title of bishop-elect and Protector of the Indians, he, accompanied by Fray Andrés de Olmos, left Spain with the first civil officials, magistrates (&quot;oidores&quot;), towards the end of August 1528, and reached Mexico on December 6. Thirteen days after, two of these judges, Alonso de Parada and Diego Maldonado, men of years and experience, died. Their companions, Juan Ortiz de Matienzo and Diego Delgadillo, assumed their authority, which was also shared by Nuño de Guzmán, who had come from his territories in the Pánuco Valley. Their administration was one of the most disastrous epochs in New Spain and one of great difficulty for Zumárraga.

=== &quot;Protector of the Indians&quot; ===

Although Zumárraga was appointed bishop on August 20, 1530, he was not consecrated until April 27, 1533. Zumárraga, as Protector of the Indians, endeavored to defend them. His position was a critical one; the Spanish monarchy had defined neither the extent of his jurisdiction nor his duties as Protector of the Indians. Moreover, he had not received official consecration as bishop, and was thus at a disadvantage when he attempted to exercise his authority. The Indians appealed to him as protector with all manner of complaints. His own Franciscans, who had so long labored for the welfare of the Indians, pressed him to put an end to the excesses of the &quot;oidores&quot;. It was clear that he must have had an open conflict with the civil officials of the colony, relying only on his spiritual prerogatives, which commanded no respect from these immoral and unprincipled men. Some members of other religious orders, perhaps envious of the influence of the Franciscans, upheld the persecution of the Indians. Bishop Zumárraga attempted to notify the Spanish court of the course of events, but the &quot;oidores&quot; had established a successful censorship of all letters and communications from New Spain. Finally, a Basque (&quot;Biscayne&quot;) sailor concealed a letter in a cake of wax which he immersed in a barrel of oil.

Meanwhile, news reached Mexico that Cortés had been well received at the Spanish court and was about to return to New Spain. Fearful of the consequences, Audiencia president Nuño de Guzmán left Mexico City on December 22, 1529, and began his famous expedition to Michoacán, Jalisco, and Sinaloa. The remaining &quot;oidores&quot; retained power and continued their outrages. In the early part of 1530 they dragged a priest and a former servant of Cortés from a church, quartered him and tortured his servant. Zumárraga placed the city under interdict, and the Franciscans retired to Texcoco. At Easter the interdict was lifted, but the &quot;oidores&quot; were excommunicated for a year. On July 15, 1530, Cortés, now titled Captain General of New Spain, reached Vera Cruz. The Crown appointed new &quot;oidores&quot;, among them Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal, Bishop of Santo Domingo, and the lawyer Vasco de Quiroga, who later became the first Bishop of Michoacán.

In December of the same year, the new &quot;Audiencia&quot;, the ensemble of &quot;oidores&quot;, reached Mexico and, with them, an era of peace for both Zumárraga and the Indians. Matienzo and Delgadillo were sent to Spain as prisoners, but Nuño de Guzmán escaped, being then absent in Sinaloa.

Meantime the calumnies spread by the enemies of Zumárraga and the partisans of the first &quot;oidor&quot; had shaken the confidence of the Spanish Court, and he set sail in May 1532 under orders to return to Spain. On his arrival he met his implacable enemy Delgadillo, who, though still under indictment, continued his calumnies. As a result of Delgadillo&#x27;s charges, Charles V held back the Bull of Clement VII, originally dated September 2, 1530, that would have named Zumárraga bishop. Zumárraga, however, had little difficulty vindicating his good name, and was consecrated bishop at Valladolid on April 27, 1533, by Diego Ribera de Toledo, Bishop of Segovia, with Francisco Zamora de Orello, Titular Bishop of &quot;Brefny&quot;, and Francisco Solís, Bishop of Drivasto, as Co-Consecrators. After another year in Spain working for favourable concessions for the Indians, he reached Mexico in October 1534, accompanied by a number of mechanics and six female teachers for the Indian girls. He no longer held the title of Protector of the Indians, as it was thought that the new &quot;oidores&quot; would refrain from the abuses of prior regimes. On November 14, 1535, with the arrival of the first viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the rule of the new &quot;oidores&quot; ended.

While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Juan López de Zárate, Bishop of Antequera, Oaxaca (1537); Francisco Marroquín Hurtado, Bishop of Santiago de Guatemala (1537); and Vasco de Quiroga, Bishop of Michoacán (1539).

=== Evangelization efforts ===
According to Fray Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, the number of baptized Indians in Mexico in 1536 was five million. The multitude of Indians who asked for baptism, said to have greatly increased after the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1531, forced the missionaries to adopt a special form for administering this sacrament. The catechumens were arranged in order, with children in front. Prayers were recited in common over all, salt, saliva, etc., applied to a few, and then water was poured on the head of each without using the customary holy oils or chrism. The practice faced no opposition while the Franciscans were in charge of the missions, but as soon as members of other religious orders and some secular ecclesiastics arrived, doubt began to be cast upon the validity of these baptisms. To put an end to the dispute Bishop Zumárraga submitted the case to Rome, and on June 1, 1537, Pope Paul III issued the bull &quot;Altitudo divini consilii&quot;, which declared that the friars had not sinned in administering baptism in this form, but decreed that in the future it should not be thus administered except in cases of urgent need.

Another difficulty arose regarding marriage. The pre-Columbian religions had permitted polygyny and the taking of concubines, and when Natives were converted the question arose as to which were legitimate wives and which were concubines, and whether any of the marriages had been valid at all. The Franciscans knew that certain rites were observed for certain unions, and that in some cases, where separation or divorce was desired, it was necessary to obtain the consent of the authorities, while in other cases the consent of the interested parties sufficed. These customs, they argued, meant that there were valid marriages among the Indians. Others denied that this was the case. Bishop Zumárraga took part in all these discussions until the case was submitted to the Holy See. Pope Paul III decreed in the &quot;Altitudo&quot; that the converted Indians should keep the first woman wed as their wife.

A third important difficulty concerned the position of the secular clergy (non-order affiliated) and their privileges. Adrian VI on May 9, 1522, issued the bull &quot;Exponi nobis fecisti&quot; to Charles V, in which he transferred his own Apostolic authority in all matters to the Franciscans and other mendicant orders when they judged it necessary for the conversion of the Indians, except for acts requiring episcopal consecration. This provision affected regions where there was no bishop, or where it required two or more days of travel to reach one. Pope Paul III confirmed the bull on January 15, 1535. The bishops found their authority much limited, and a series of assemblies followed in which Zumárraga with his customary prudence tried to arrive at an understanding with the regulars without openly clashing with them. Various modifications were adopted with the consent of the regulars on condition that these &quot;should not impair the privileges of the regulars&quot;. The question therefore remained open. In 1535, Bishop Zumárraga received the title and powers of Apostolic Inquisitor of the diocese of Mexico from the Inquisitor General, Álvaro Manrique, Archbishop of Seville, including that of delivering criminals to the secular courts. He never availed himself of the title and did not establish the tribunal, although he did indict and deliver to the secular courts a lord of Texcoco, known as Don Carlos Ometochtzin Chichimecatecuhtli, accused of having &quot;reverted to idolatry&quot; and of offering human sacrifices.

Meanwhile, Fray Las Casas had gone to Spain and obtained from the Junta of Valladolid (1541–1542) the approbation of the celebrated &quot;Nuevas Leyes&quot;. These laws conclusively and decisively prohibited the enslavement of the Indians, withdrew all grants from all corporations, ecclesiastical and secular, and from those who were or had been Viceroys, governors, or employees of any description whatsoever; previous grants were reduced; Indians were taken from owners who had ill-treated them; all governors were deprived of the faculty to &quot;encomendar&quot; (a system of patents which permitted forced labor of the Indians); owners were compelled to live upon their own possessions; and in all newly discovered territory no grants could be made. Francisco Tello de Sandoval, commissioned to carry out the New Laws, reached Mexico on March 8, 1544.

The gravest difficulties confronted him. Those affected by the new laws were almost all the Spaniards of the colony, many of them far advanced in years, who had passed through all the trying period of the conquest, and whom the new laws would leave in abject poverty. These had recourse to Bishop Zumárraga to intercede with Tello to obtain a suspension of the order until they could be heard before the Spanish Court. The representatives of the colonists found the emperor, Charles V, at Mechlin, on October 20, 1545. In virtue of the situation as explained to him, he modified the general tenor of the laws so that while still correcting the principal abuses, they would not bear too heavily on the Spaniards of the colony. Through the prudent intervention of Bishop Zumárraga and the compliance of Tello, Mexico was undoubtedly saved from a bloody civil struggle such as engulfed Peru on account of the enforcement of these same laws and from which the Indians emerged worse off than they were before.

=== Later years ===
The last years of Bishop Zumárraga&#x27;s life were devoted to carrying out the numerous works he had undertaken for the welfare of his diocese. Among the chief of these should be mentioned: the school for Indian girls; the famous &quot;Colegio de Santa Cruz&quot; in Tlatelolco; the introduction of the first printing press into the New World; the foundation of various hospitals, especially those of Mexico and Vera Cruz; the impetus he gave to industries, agriculture, and manufactures, for which he brought trained mechanics and labourers from Spain; and the printing of many books. At the instance of the emperor, Pope Paul III separated (February 11, 1546) the See of Mexico from the metropolitan See of Seville, and erected the Archdiocese of Mexico, appointing Bishop Zumárraga first archbishop and designating the dioceses of Oaxaca, Michoacán, Tlaxcala, Guatemala, and Ciudad Real de Chiapas, as suffragans. The Bull of appointment was sent on July 8, 1548, but Bishop Zumárraga had died one month previously.

Bishop Zumarraga is also credited with chocolate becoming a popular drink among Europeans. A community of nuns in Oaxaca, after encountering a recipe of cocoa mixed with sugar, prepared it for the bishop. Prior to this, ground cocoa had not found a role in European diets.

<text>Wright is an occupational surname originating in England and Scotland. The term &#x27;Wright&#x27; comes from the circa 700 AD Old English word &#x27;wryhta&#x27; or &#x27;wyrhta&#x27;, meaning worker or shaper of wood. Later it became any occupational worker (for example, a shipwright is a person who builds ships), and is used as a British family name.

The word&#x27;s use as an occupational title continued until the mid-19th century, often combined with other words such as in shipwright, wheelwright, wainwright and playwright. &quot;, Wright&quot; was the eleventh most common surname in England.

The word &quot;carpentier&quot;, now &quot;carpenter&quot;, was introduced into England in the years after the Norman conquest in 1066 and slowly replaced the traditional name and meaning of wright in most of England. &#x27;Wright&#x27; is still used in Scottish English in the original meaning of &#x27;skilled woodworker&#x27;. The Incorporation of Wrights of the Trades House of Glasgow, and the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons of Edinburgh Trades retain the word in its original meaning in their role of promoting the woodworking trade.

Wright is also an anglicised version of the Scots Gaelic clan name &quot;MacIntyre&quot; or &quot;Mac an t-Saoir&quot;, meaning &quot;son of the wright&quot; (son of the carpenter).
In Ireland, the native Gaelic Mac an Cheairt sept of County Mayo occasionally changed their name to Wright. This is a literal translation meaning, &quot;son of the right or righteous&quot;.

<text>Fluxx is a card game, played with a specially designed deck published by Looney Labs. It is different from most other card games, in that the rules and the conditions for winning are altered throughout the game, via cards played by the players.

==History==
&quot;Fluxx&quot; was created by Andrew Looney on as the first game for his and his wife&#x27;s part-time game design company, Looney Laboratory. The original print run was for 5,000 units and was released in 1997.

The game was successful and was licensed a year later to Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) for wider distribution. ICE went bankrupt two years later and Looney Labs resumed publication and distribution. By , Labs was considering putting out another standalone deck version called &quot;Fluxx++&quot; using card created by the Fluxx playing community with &quot;Fluxx Blanxx&quot; and &quot;Fluxx: Goals Galore&quot;, an expansion consisting of goal cards, based on its Origins 2000 5 Goal cards promo pack. Labs created &quot;Fluxx Lite&quot;, a slimmed down 56 card deck to lower the price for discount superstores, in design by .

In 2003, Amigo Games, a German game company, licensed and published a German language version of &quot;Fluxx&quot;. The in design &quot;Fluxx Reduxx&quot; was indefinitely placed on hold as of to focus on EcoFluxx. Looney Labs registered the Fluxx trademark. By , Stoner Fluxx had been released and EcoFluxx was in play testing, and scheduled to be released later that month followed by &quot;Family Fluxx&quot;.

In , Looney Labs issued a Spanish language edition of the game. The release of a zombie-themed version brought the first of a new card type, the Creeper and Ungoal. In 2008, Toy Vault and Looney Labs co-published and released &quot;Monty Python Fluxx&quot;. Fluxx edition 4 was released in and was the first set to have the Meta Rule subtype card, which stemmed from a Fluxx Tournament rule.

In 2008, &quot;Zombie Fluxx&quot; won the Origins Award for Traditional Card Game of the Year. &quot;Stoner Fluxx&quot; was placed back in print under the Full Baked Ideas imprint of Looney Labs on after being out of print for four years. Full Baked was launched with expectation of a future release of a drinking variant and other mature subject versions.

Two variants were re-released on , &quot;EcoFluxx&quot; and &quot;Family Fluxx&quot;, with Eco being a new edition. In , the Surprise subtype of cards were introduced in the &quot;Pirate Fluxx&quot; themed variant. In , the German language version 2nd edition was released by Pegasus Games. By over 1 million decks of all Fluxx versions had been sold while Pirate Fluxx was getting into bookstores that month.

On , Looney Labs got a simplified, less expensive general market version with redesigned packaging of Fluxx into Target stores. For the summer 2012, Fluxx was number 10 in ICv2&#x27;s Top 10 Card/Building Games (hobby channel).

A Cartoon Network version of the game was made available as a Target exclusive from mid-August 2014 until Easter 2015, while in July the &quot;Regular Show Fluxx&quot; was released to the hobby market. The fifth edition of the regular Fluxx game was made available beginning in 2014 as the 4.0 edition ran out. Looney Labs teamed up with The Doubleclicks for a Fluxx theme song.

A new expansion of the game, &quot;Fluxx Dice&quot;, plus two new licensed variants were scheduled to be released in the summer of 2015. With a delay of the first variant to be released at the polled requested of the retailers, Looney Labs pushed back the dice and the other variant to stagger the releases to spread out the impact.

A series of educational variants were released in 2017 and 2018. In partnership with Gale Force 9, two Fluxx versions of Star Trek were released in August 2018.

==Game description and play==
The first edition deck consists of 84 cards with four types of cards: Keepers, Goals, Actions, and New Rules. While the game begins by requiring players to simply draw and play a specific number of cards, the mechanic mutates when a New Rule card is played. The card may change the number of cards drawn or played per turn, the number of cards held per hand, or the Keepers played. The Goal cards change the Keepers needed to win the game. Games last from 5 to 30 minutes.

Later sets sometimes included new card subtypes, depending on the theme of the set. These included Creeper cards that block or make goals more difficult to obtain; Ungoal cards, which have conditions where the game ends with no winner; and Surprise cards, a 2011 addition, which allow players to negate other types of cards which could prevent a victory and can be played at any time, though they have other effects when played on one&#x27;s own turn.

The first Fluxx tournament at Origins 1997 had an extra rule calling for an increase in the Basic Rules each time the deck was reshuffled which was kept for future tournaments. On via their Wunderland blog, Looney introduced &quot;Meta Rule&quot; cards for players to print at home and add to standard decks or place in the primary deck Edition 4.0.

Early edition decks had 84 cards while newer standard decks have 100 cards, while &quot;Lite&quot; versions (Family, Spanish, SE) consist of 56 cards.

====Board game====

&quot;Fluxx: The Board Game&quot; is a board game implementation of the card game released in . This game was awarded the Parents&#x27; Choice Recommended Seal Fall 2013 for Games. Parents&#x27; Choice Recommended Seal Fall 2013 Games
The game moves the Keeper card items to spaces on the board while adding the &quot;Leaper&quot; card type. The board is separated into 9 movable tiles with four spaces each except for the start tile with the initial set up of 3x3 square. Besides the Keeper spaces there are 1 octagon space per title and two teleport spaces for the whole board. Moving on to one teleport space allows the player to move to the other teleport space. The octagon may hold any number of pawns while the keeper spaces can only have one with an incoming pawn pushing out the current pawn. There are two peg boards that track, the number of goals needed to win and current rules.

All start with a hand of three cards and a color card in face up to indicate the pawns they control. They each get to make a free rule change. New general rules affecting the tiles include rotation, moving and allowing tile movement. The game only has Action, Goals, New Rules and Leaper type cards. Action cards can change force a change in player color. A Leaper card counts as a card play but allows you to move a pawn to the item on the board. Goals cards are stacked near the board with top most card the current goal.

===Promotional cards===

They have given away cards such as Composting and Jackpot, which later appeared in &quot;EcoFluxx&quot; and &quot;Family Fluxx&quot; respectively. They have also given away promo cards for Christmas to members of their online mailing list and in &quot;High Times&quot; magazine. Game Technicians (previously known as Mad Lab Rabbits), voluntary game demonstrators for Looney Labs, give away promo cards to people interested in the game.

===Online===
&quot;Fluxx&quot; was available to play for free via the Volity network and was also available to be played online via the CCG Workshop, using the gatlingEngine to adjudicate most of its rules automatically. However, both Volity.net and CCG Workshop are no longer operating.

In December 2012, &quot;Fluxx&quot; was released by Playdek as an app on iOS operating systems (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple TV) by purchasing it from the Apple App Store. It uses the &quot;mass market&quot; deck developed for Target Stores, removing some of the more esoteric themes (such as Cthulhu) and complex rule cards.

==Reception==
The base game won the Mensa Select Game Award in 1999. Rick Loomis comments: &quot;&quot;Fluxx&quot; makes a good game for a group that has one of those annoying &#x27;I-must-win-every-game&#x27; types. The rest of you can enjoy yourselves as the game spins out of his control (as it surely will) and perhaps he&#x27;ll eventually learn to lose gracefully. Meanwhile, &quot;Fluxx&quot; will be busily exercising everyone&#x27;s logic synapses as you attempt to deal with the chaotic situations that occur because of the cheerful clash of rules.&quot;

An ICv2 review of the Batman variant by Nick Smith gave it 4 out of 5 stars as &quot;The Fluxx series of games is not for everyone.&quot; But the game worked well with the Batman theme: &quot;The game-themed victory conditions are good, and the thematic elements were very well thought out. This may be the best-designed Fluxx set in some time, and it can be a lot of fun for casual fans to try to achieve the thematic victory conditions.&quot;

In a review of &quot;Fluxx&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, M Harold Page said &quot;Playability-wise, the rules are on the cards themselves. Complex though play can be, &quot;playing&quot; the game is simple. My 7-year old manages fine with a little help to start her off, and my 11-year-old has sessions with his friends.&quot;

<text>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all biotic and abiotic things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.
The concept of the &quot;natural environment&quot; can be distinguished as components:
* Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, plateaus, mountains, the atmosphere and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.
* Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.

In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. Built environments are where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams and the works of mound-building termites are thought of as natural.

People cannot find &quot;absolutely natural&quot; environments on Earth,naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. The massive environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments including: climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other chemicals in the air and water. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.

== Composition ==

Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere and the biosphere as correspondent to rocks, water, air and life respectively. Some scientists include as part of the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the pedosphere (to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geographical sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely geography, geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or &quot;spheres&quot; of Earth.

==Geological activity==

The Earth&#x27;s crust or lithosphere, is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically, physically and mechanically different from underlying mantle. It has been generated greatly by igneous processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the decay of radioactive elements. The mantle though solid is in a state of rheic convection. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate tectonics. Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material or of rising mantle at mid-ocean ridges and mantle plumes.

==Water on Earth==

Most water is found in various kinds of natural body of water.

=== Oceans ===

An ocean is a major body of saline water and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the surface of the Earth (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several separate oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean. The deep seabeds are more than half the Earth&#x27;s surface, and are among the least-modified natural environments. The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos and other criteria, these divisions are : (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean and the Arctic Ocean.

=== Rivers ===

A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely without reaching another body of water.
The water in a river is usually in a channel, made up of a stream bed between banks. In larger rivers there is often also a wider floodplain shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs and the release of water stored in glaciers and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek and brook. Their current is confined within a bed and stream banks. Streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as &quot;surface hydrology&quot;.
=== Lakes ===


A lake (from Latin &quot;lacus&quot;) is a terrain feature, a body of water that is localized to the bottom of basin. A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an ocean and is larger and deeper than a pond.
Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

==== Ponds ====

A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind-driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.

=== Human impact on water ===
Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through dams and stream channelization), urbanization and deforestation. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation. We build dams and reservoirs and manipulate the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams can usefully create reservoirs and hydroelectric power. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stop fish migration and the movement of organisms downstream. Urbanization affects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.

== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==


The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet&#x27;s gravity. Dry air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon, inert gases and carbon dioxide. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases. The atmosphere includes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor and suspensions of water droplets and ice crystals seen as clouds. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including dust, pollen and spores, sea spray, volcanic ash and meteoroids. Various industrial pollutants also may be present, such as chlorine (elementary or in compounds), fluorine compounds, elemental mercury, and sulphur compounds such as sulphur dioxide (SO2).

The ozone layer of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere plays an important role in reducing the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

===Layers of the atmosphere===
====Principal layers====
Earth&#x27;s atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:
* Exosphere: The outermost layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium.
* Thermosphere: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the exobase. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about . The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between . In another way, the thermosphere is Earth&#x27;s second highest atmospheric layer, extending from approximately 260,000 feet at the mesopause to the thermopause at altitudes ranging from 1,600,000 to 3,300,000 feet.
* Mesosphere: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to . It is the layer where most meteors burn up upon entering the atmosphere.
* Stratosphere: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about . The stratopause, which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at .
* Troposphere: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between at the poles and at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

; Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature there are several layers determined by other properties.
* The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about , though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The ionosphere: The part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
* The homosphere and heterosphere: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
* The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth&#x27;s surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion.

====Effects of global warming====

The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans&#x27; existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.
Efforts have been increasingly focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on developing adaptative strategies to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and nations in adjusting to the effects of global warming. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:
* The United Nations Framework Convention Treaty and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
* The Kyoto Protocol, which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.
* The Western Climate Initiative, to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

===Climate===

Climate looks at the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological elements in a given region over long periods of time. Weather, on the other hand, is the present condition of these same elements over periods up to two weeks.

Climates can be classified according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, uses evapotranspiration as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of climate changes.

===Weather===
Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, &quot;weather&quot; is understood to be the weather of Earth.

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth&#x27;s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth&#x27;s surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (100 °F to −40 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth&#x27;s orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influenced long-term climate.

Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The atmosphere is a chaotic system, and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

==Life==


Evidence suggests that life on Earth has existed for about 3.7 billion years. All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple organic molecules via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms. In biology, the science of living organisms, &quot;life&quot; is the condition which distinguishes active organisms from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, functional activity and the continual change preceding death.

A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the biosphere on Earth, and properties common to these organisms—plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria—are a carbon- and water-based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce and, through natural selection, adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.

==Ecosystems==

An ecosystem (also called an environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals, and micro-organisms (biotic factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical (abiotic) factors of the environment.

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the environment in which they exist. Eugene Odum, one of the founders of the science of ecology, stated: &quot;Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the &quot;community&quot;) in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.&quot;

The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature dichotomy, and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.

A more significant number or variety of species or biological diversity of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus &quot;absorb&quot; or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem&#x27;s structure changes to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as human ecosystems and human-influenced ecosystems. It can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine wilderness areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.
==Biogeochemical cycles==

Global biogeochemical cycles are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.
* The nitrogen cycle is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
* The water cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
* The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
* The oxygen cycle is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for the modern Earth&#x27;s atmospheric composition and life.
* The phosphorus cycle is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

==Wilderness==


Wilderness is generally defined as a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by human activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: &quot;The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet – those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.&quot; Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, moral, and aesthetic reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.

The word, &quot;wilderness&quot;, derives from the notion of wildness; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word etymology is from the Old English &quot;wildeornes&quot;, which in turn derives from &quot;wildeor&quot; meaning &quot;wild beast&quot; (wild + deor = beast, deer). From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being &quot;wilderness&quot;. Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered &quot;wild&quot;. This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

Wildlife includes all non-domesticated plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed urban sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

==Challenges==


It is the common understanding of &quot;natural environment&quot; that underlies environmentalism — a broad political, social and philosophical movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, &quot;wild&quot; nature (e.g., unmanaged forests, uncultivated grasslands, wildlife, wildflowers) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by environmental scientists and environmentalists include:
* Elimination of pollution and toxicants in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
* Preservation of biodiversity and protection of endangered species.
* Conservation and sustainable use of resources such as water, land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
* Halting human-induced global warming, which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
* Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability. This may include public transportation and distributed generation, which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
* Shifting from meat-intensive diets to largely plant-based diets in order to help mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change.
* Establishment of nature reserves for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
* Sustainable and less polluting waste management including waste reduction (or even zero waste), reuse, recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge.
* Reducing profligate consumption and clamping down on illegal fishing and logging.
* Slowing and stabilisation of human population growth.
* Reducing the import of second hand electronic appliances from developed countries to developing countries.

==Criticism==
In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings. Specifically in the United States and Arabian countries many native cultures do not recognize the &quot;environment&quot;, or see themselves as environmentalists.

<doc id="558698" wikidata="Q208468" url="?curid=558698" title="Taslima Nasrin">
<text>Taslima Nasrin (born 25 August 1962) is a Bangladeshi writer, physician, feminist, secular humanist, and activist. She is known for her writing on women&#x27;s oppression and criticism of religion; some of her books are banned in Bangladesh. She has also been blacklisted and banished from the Bengal region, both from Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.

She gained global attention by the beginning of 1990s owing to her essays and novels with feminist views and criticism of what she characterizes as all &quot;misogynistic&quot; religions. Nasrin has been living in exile since 1994, with multiple fatwas calling for her death. After living more than a decade in Europe and the United States, she moved to India in 2004 and has been staying there on a resident permit long-term, multiple-entry or &#x27;X&#x27; visa since.

==Early life and career==
Nasrin is the daughter of Dr. Rajab Ali and Edul Ara, Bengali Muslims of Mymensingh. Her father was a physician, and a professor of Medical Jurisprudence in Mymensingh Medical College, also at Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College. After high school in 1976 (SSC) and higher secondary studies in college (HSC) in 1978, she studied medicine at the Mymensingh Medical College, an affiliated medical college of the University of Dhaka and graduated in 1984 with an MBBS degree.

In college, she wrote and edited a poetry journal called &quot;Shenjuti&quot;. After graduation, she worked at a family planning clinic in Mymensingh, then practised at the gynaecology department of Mitford hospital and at the anesthesia department of Dhaka Medical College hospital. While she studied and practised medicine, she saw girls who had been raped; she also heard women cry out in despair in the delivery room if their baby was a girl. Born into a Muslim family, she became an atheist over time. In the course of writing she took a feminist approach.

===Literary career===
Early in her literary career, Nasrin wrote mainly poetry, and published half a dozen collections of poetry between 1982 and 1993, often with female oppression as a theme, and often containing very graphic language. She started publishing prose in the late 1980s, and produced three collections of essays and four novels before the publication of her documentary novel &quot;Lajja&quot; () in which a Hindu family was being attacked by Muslim fanatics and decided to leave the country. Nasrin suffered a number of physical and other attacks for her critical scrutiny of Islam and her demand for women&#x27;s equality. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets demanding her execution by hanging. In October 1993, a radical fundamentalist group called the Council of Islamic Soldiers offered a bounty for her death.

In May 1994, she was interviewed by the Kolkata edition of &quot;The Statesman&quot;, which quoted her as calling for a revision of the Quran; she claims she only called for abolition of the Sharia, the Islamic religious law. In August 1994 she was brought up on &quot;charges of making inflammatory statements,&quot; and faced criticism from Islamic fundamentalists. A few hundred thousand demonstrators called her &quot;an apostate appointed by imperial forces to vilify Islam&quot;; a member of a &quot;militant faction threatened to set loose thousands of poisonous snakes in the capital unless she was executed.&quot; After spending two months in hiding, at the end of 1994 she escaped to Sweden, consequently ceasing her medical practice and becoming a full-time writer and activist.

==Life in exile==
Leaving Bangladesh towards the end of 1994, Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; she was granted citizenship by the Swedish government and took refuge in Germany. She allegedly had to wait for six years (1994–1999) to get a visa to visit India. In 1998, she wrote &quot;Meyebela, My Bengali Girlhood&quot;, her biographical account from birth to adolescence. She never got a Bangladeshi passport to return to the country to visit her parents, now both deceased.

===2004–2007, life in Kolkata===

In 2004, she was granted a renewable temporary residential permit by India and moved to Kolkata in the state of West Bengal, which shares a common heritage and language with Bangladesh; in an interview in 2007, after she had been forced to flee, she called Kolkata her home. The government of India extended her visa to stay in the country on a periodic basis, though it refused to grant her Indian citizenship. While living in Kolkata, Nasrin regularly contributed to Indian newspapers and magazines, including &quot;Anandabazar Patrika&quot; and &quot;Desh&quot;, and, for some time, wrote a weekly column in the Bengali version of &quot;The Statesman&quot;.

Again her criticism of Islam was met with opposition from religious fundamentalists: in June 2006, Syed Noorur Rehaman Barkati, the imam of Kolkata&#x27;s Tipu Sultan Mosque, admitted offering money to anyone who &quot;blackened [that is, publicly humiliated] Ms Nasreen&#x27;s face.&quot; Even abroad controversy followed: on the US Independence Day weekend in 2005, she criticized US foreign policy and tried to read her poem titled &quot;America&quot; to a large Bengali crowd at the North American Bengali Conference at Madison Square Garden in New York City, but was booed off the stage. Back in India, the &quot;All India Muslim Personal Board (Jadeed)&quot; offered 500,000 rupees for her beheading in March 2007. The group&#x27;s president, Tauqeer Raza Khan, said the only way the bounty would be lifted was if Nasrin &quot;apologises, burns her books and leaves.&quot;

In 2007, elected and serving members of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen made threats against Taslima Nasreen, pledging that the &quot;fatwa&quot; against her and Salman Rushdie were to be abided by. While she was in Hyderabad releasing Telugu translations of her work, she was attacked by party members led by 3 MLAs- Mohammed Muqtada Khan, Mohammed Moazzam Khan and Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri - were then charged and arrested.

====Expulsion from Kolkata====
On 9 August 2007, Nasrin was in Hyderabad to present the Telugu translation of one of her novels, &quot;Shodh&quot;, when she was allegedly attacked by a mob, led by legislators from the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, an Indian political party. A week later, on 17 August, Muslim leaders in Kolkata revived an old fatwa against her, urging her to leave the country and offering an unlimited amount of money to anybody who would kill her. On 21 November, Kolkata witnessed a protest against Nasrin. A protest organised by the &quot;All India Minority Forum&quot; caused chaos in the city and forced the army&#x27;s deployment to restore order. After the riots, Nasrin was forced to move from Kolkata, her &quot;adopted city,&quot; to Jaipur, and to New Delhi the following day.

The government of India kept Nasrin in an undisclosed location in New Delhi, effectively under house arrest, for more than seven months. In January 2008, she was selected for the Simone de Beauvoir award in recognition of her writing on women&#x27;s rights, but declined to go to Paris to receive the award. She explained that &quot;I don&#x27;t want to leave India at this stage and would rather fight for my freedom here,&quot; but she had to be hospitalised for three days with several complaints. The house arrest quickly acquired an international dimension: in a letter to the London-based human rights organisation Amnesty International, India&#x27;s former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey urged the organisation to pressure the Indian government so Nasrin could safely return to Kolkata.

From New Delhi, Nasrin commented: &quot;I&#x27;m writing a lot, but not about Islam, It&#x27;s not my subject now. This is about politics. In the last three months I have been put under severe pressure to leave [West] Bengal by the police.&quot; In an email interview from the undisclosed safehouse, Nasrin talked about the stress caused by &quot;this unendurable loneliness, this uncertainty and this deathly silence.&quot; She cancelled the publication of the sixth part of her autobiography &quot;Nei Kichu Nei&quot; (&quot;No Entity&quot;), and — under pressure — deleted some passages from &quot;Dwikhandito&quot;, the controversial book that was the boost for the riots in Kolkata. She was forced to leave India on 19 March 2008.

Nasrin moved to Sweden in 2008 and later worked as a research scholar at New York University. Since, as she claims, &quot;her soul lived in India,&quot; she also pledged her body to the country, by awarding it for posthumous medical use to Gana Darpan, a Kolkata-based NGO, in 2005. She eventually returned to India, but was forced to stay in New Delhi as the West Bengal government refused to permit her entry. Currently her visa received a one-year extension in 2016 and Nasreen is also seeking permanent residency in India but no decision has been taken on it by the Home Ministry.

In 2015 Nasrin was threatened with death by Al Qaeda-linked extremists, and so the Center for Inquiry assisted her in travelling to the United States, where she now lives. The Center for Inquiry (CFI) that helped evacuate her to the U.S. on 27 May gave an official statement in June 2015 stating that her safety &quot;is only temporary if she cannot remain in the U.S., however, which is why CFI has established an emergency fund to help with food, housing, and the means for her to be safely settled&quot;.

==Literary works==
Nasrin started writing poetry when she was thirteen. While still at college in Mymensingh, she published and edited a literary magazine, &quot;SeNjuti&quot; (&quot;Light in the dark&quot;), from 1978 to 1983. She published her first collection of poems in 1986. Her second collection, &quot;Nirbashito Bahire Ontore&quot; (&quot;Banished within and without&quot;) was published in 1989. She succeeded in attracting a wider readership when she started writing columns in late 1980s, and, in the early 1990s, she began writing novels, for which she has won significant acclaim. In all, she has written more than thirty books of poetry, essays, novels, short stories, and memoirs, and her books have been translated into 20 different languages.

Her own experience of sexual abuse during adolescence and her work as a gynaecologist influenced her a great deal in writing about the treatment of women in Islam and against religion in general. Her writing is characterised by two connected elements: her struggle with the religion of her native culture, and her feminist philosophy. She cites Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir as influences, and, when pushed to think of one closer to home, Begum Rokeya, who lived during the time of undivided Bengal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her later poetry also evidences a connection to place, to Bangladesh and India.

===Columns and essays===
In 1989 Nasrin began to contribute to the weekly political magazine &quot;Khaborer Kagoj&quot;, edited by Nayeemul Islam Khan, and published from Dhaka. Her feminist views and anti-religion remarks articles succeeded in drawing broad attention, and she shocked the religious and conservative society of Bangladesh by her radical comments and suggestions. Later she collected these columns in a volume titled &quot;Nirbachita Column&quot;, which in 1992 won her first Ananda Purashkar award, a prestigious award for Bengali writers. During her life in Kolkata, she contributed a weekly essay to the Bengali version of &quot;The Statesman&quot;, called &quot;Dainik Statesman&quot;. Taslima has always advocated for an Indian Uniform civil code, and said that criticism of Islam is the only way to establish secularism in Islamic countries. Taslima said that Triple talaq is despicable and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board should be abolished. Taslima used to write articles for online media venture The Print in India.

===Novels===
In 1992 Nasrin produced two novellas which failed to draw attention.

Her breakthrough novel &quot;Lajja&quot; (&quot;Shame&quot;) was published in 1993, and attracted wide attention because of its controversial subject matter. It contained the struggle of a patriotic Bangladeshi Hindu family in a Muslim environment. Initially written as a thin documentary, &quot;Lajja&quot; grew into a full-length novel as the author later revised it substantially. In six months&#x27; time, it sold 50,000 copies in Bangladesh before being banned by the government that same year.

Her other famous novel is &quot;French Lover&quot;, published in year 2002.

===Autobiography===
&quot;Amar Meyebela&quot; (&quot;My Girlhood&quot;, 2002), the first volume of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi government in 1999 for &quot;reckless comments&quot; against Islam and the prophet Mohammad. &quot;Utal Hawa&quot; (&quot;Wild Wind&quot;), the second part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladesh government in 2002. &quot;Ka&quot; (&quot;Speak up&quot;), the third part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi High Court in 2003. Under pressure from Indian Muslim activists, the book, which was published in West Bengal as &quot;Dwikhandita&quot;, was banned there also; some 3,000 copies were seized immediately. The decision to ban the book was criticized by &quot;a host of authors&quot; in West Bengal, but the ban was not lifted until 2005. &quot;Sei Sob Ondhokar&quot; (&quot;Those Dark Days&quot;), the fourth part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladesh government in 2004.
To date, a total of seven parts of her autobiography have been published. &quot;Ami bhalo nei tumi bhalo theko priyo desh&quot;, &quot; Nei kichu nei&quot; and &quot;Nirbashito&quot;. All seven parts have been published by Peoples&#x27;s Book Society, Kolkata.
She received her second &quot;Ananda Purashkar&quot; award in 2000, for her memoir &quot;Amar Meyebela&quot; (&quot;My Girlhood&quot;, published in English in 2002).

==Nasrin&#x27;s life and works in adaptation==
Nasrin&#x27;s life is the subject of a number of plays and songs, in the east and the west. The Swedish singer Magoria sang &quot;Goddess in you, Taslima,&quot; and the French band Zebda composed &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Taslima&quot; as an homage.

Her work has been adapted for TV and even turned into music. &quot;Jhumur&quot; was a 2006 TV serial based on a story written especially for the show. Bengali singers like Fakir Alamgir, Samina Nabi, Rakhi Sen sang her songs. Steve Lacy, the jazz soprano saxophonist, met Nasrin in 1996 and collaborated with her on an adaptation of her poetry to music. The result, a &quot;controversial&quot; and &quot;compelling&quot; work called &quot;The Cry&quot;, was performed in Europe and North America. Initially, Nasrin was to recite during the performance, but these recitations were dropped after the 1996 Berlin world première because of security concerns.

==Controversy==

=== Abrar Fahad ===
In 2019, she garnered criticism from all over Bangladesh following her comment on Abrar Fahad in a Facebook status where she claimed &quot;Abrar Fahad behaved like a Shibir Member&quot;. Her critics included Asif Nazrul who called her a &quot;mentally unstable person&quot; for making such a comparison.

=== Burqa ===
When Sri Lanka banned the burqa in 2019, Nasrin took to Twitter to show her support for the decision. She described the burqa as a &#x27;mobile prison,&#x27; a comment which was reported on by journalists.

=== Eugenics ===
In a 2019 tweet, she stated on Twitter thatMen and women who have bad genes with genetic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer etc should not produce children. They have no right to make others suffer. Some commentators cited this as support for eugenics. Nasrin has denied this, stating that she is not a supporter of eugenics, and that her comment was not serious, and had been taken out of context.

=== Moeen Ali ===
In a 2021 tweet about British cricketer Moeen Ali she said, If Moeen Ali were not stuck with cricket, he would have gone to Syria to join ISIS.She faced significant criticism because of this tweet including Moeen&#x27;s teammates Jofra Archer, Sam Billings and Saqib Mahmood. Replying to Nasreen&#x27;s original tweet, Archer wrote, &quot;Are you okay? I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re okay&quot;. Saqib Mahmood wrote, &quot;Can’t believe this. Disgusting tweet. Disgusting individual&quot;. She later justified her tweet with another tweet,Haters know very well that my Moeen Ali tweet was sarcastic. But they made that an issue to humiliate me because I try to secularize Muslim society &amp; I oppose Islamic fanaticism. One of the greatest tragedies of humankind is pro-women leftists support anti-women Islamists.Archer also blasted Nasreen&#x27;s attempt at damage control with her second tweet. &quot;Sarcastic? No one is laughing, not even yourself, the least you can do is delete the tweet,&quot; Archer wrote.

Moeen Ali&#x27;s father Munir said,If she looks into a mirror, she will know what she tweeted is what is fundamentalist – a vicious stereotype against a Muslim person, a clearly Islamophobic statement. Someone who doesn’t have self-respect and respect for others can only stoop to this level.She later deleted her original tweet.

=== Boycott Islam ===
After a knife terror attack at a church in Nice in 2020, Taslima tweeted &quot;Boycott Islam&quot;. This led to formal complaints against for spreading disharmony and communal hate in India. This included Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale filing a complaint with the Home Ministry of India. He said in a tweet,A Swedish national spreading communal hate speech in India will NOT be tolerated.Taslima later deleted that tweet.

=== Mahfuj Alam ===
In 2024, Taslima faced significant backlash after asserting that Mahfuj Alam was the leader of Hizb-ut-Tahrir in a Facebook status despite not having any concrete evidence of it. This led to the Indian mainstream media picking up on it and publishing it as news without further fact checking. Her actions quickly sparked a wave of memes and trolling on social media, with many people questioning her motives and even speculating about her mental state.

==Writers and intellectuals for and against Nasrin==
Nasrin has been criticized by writers and intellectuals in both Bangladesh and West Bengal for targeted scandalisation. Because of &quot;obnoxious, false and ludicrous&quot; comments in &quot;Ka&quot;, &quot;written with the &#x27;intention to injure the reputation of the plaintiff&#x27;&quot;, Syed Shamsul Haq, Bangladeshi poet and novelist, filed a defamation suit against Nasrin in 2003. In the book, she mentions that Haq confessed to her that he had a relationship with his sister-in-law. A West Bengali poet, Hasmat Jalal, did the same; his suit led to the High Court banning the book, which was published in India as &quot;Dwikhondito&quot;. Nearly 4 million dollars were claimed in defamation lawsuits against her after the book was published. The West Bengal Government, supposedly pressured by 24 literary intellectuals, decided to ban Nasrin&#x27;s book in 2003. Some commented that she did it to earn fame. She defended herself against the allegations, responding that she had written her life&#x27;s story, not those of others. She enjoyed support from Bengali writers and intellectuals like Annada Shankar Ray, Sibnarayan Ray and Amlan Dutta.

Recently she was supported and defended by author Mahasweta Devi, poet Joy Goswami, and artist Paritosh Sen. In India, noted writers Arundhati Roy, Girish Karnad, and others defended her when she was under house arrest in Delhi in 2007, and co-signed a statement calling on the Indian government to grant her permanent residency in India or, should she ask for it, citizenship. In Bangladesh, writer and philosopher Kabir Chowdhury also supported her strongly.

<text>==Ireland (and predecessor states)==
The executive branch of the modern state of Ireland is titled the Government of Ireland. It has had this title since the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937. The Ministry of Dáil Éireann was the cabinet of the unrecognised Irish Republic, which operated from 1919 to 1922. This overlapped with the Provisional Government which was put in place after the approval of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922. Both these cabinets ceased to operate from December 1922, on the coming into being of the Irish Free State. From 1922 to 1937, the cabinet was known as the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.

==Northern Ireland==

The current devolved branch of Northern Ireland is known as the Northern Ireland Executive, established under the Good Friday Agreement. The Executive has been in operation, intermittently, since 1999, and is current operational. Since 1921, Northern Ireland has been governed by two other devolved cabinets: Executive Committee of the Privy Council from 1921 to 1972 and the Northern Ireland Executive of 1974. Northern Ireland has also been governed by direct rule from 1972 to 1974, 1974–98 and 2002–07.

===Types of government since 1921===
===Direct rule===
*The Northern Ireland Office under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, established initially by the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 and later Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.
===Cabinets since 1921===

<doc id="558722" wikidata="Q1571836" url="?curid=558722" title="Social environment">
<text>The social environment, social context, sociocultural context or milieu refers to the immediate physical and social setting in which people live or in which something happens or develops. It includes the culture that the individual was educated or lives in, and the people and institutions with whom they interact. The interaction may be in person or through communication media, even anonymous or one-way, and may not imply equality of social status. The social environment is a broader concept than that of social class or social circle.

The physical and social environment is a determining factor in active and healthy aging in place, being a central factor in the study of environmental gerontology.

Moreover, the social environment is the setting where people live and interact. It includes the buildings and roads around them, the jobs available, and how money flows; relationships between people, like who has power and how different groups get along; and culture, like art, religion, and traditions. It includes the physical world and the way people relate to each other and their communities.

==Components==

*The physical environment is the ever-changing natural world, including weather, land, and natural resources. Floods or earthquakes can alter the landscape, affecting how plants and animals live. Human interaction with nature can also have an impact. For example, logging can change the weather in that area, pollution can make water dirty, and habitat fragmentation caused by human activity makes it so animals cannot move around as easily, which can cause problems for their families.
*Social relations are how people interact with each other. Sociologist Emile Durkheim thought that if these interactions were disrupted, it could affect how we feel. Social relations can offer social support, which means the different ways people help each other out. This could be emotional support, like comforting someone when they are sad, or practical support, like helping with chores. Being part of groups, like families or clubs, can also make people feel good about ourselves; conversely, not having good relationships or having too many problems with others can make them feel bad. So, having good connections with people can make us happier and healthier.
*&quot;Sociocultural&quot; basically means the mix of society and culture that affects how people think, feel, and act, which can also affect our health. It includes things like how wealth, education, career, cultural background, race, ethnicity, language, and beliefs shape people&#x27;s identity and health.
*Interpersonal relationships are how people connect with others emotionally and socially. When someone has a mental disorder, it often affects how they get along with people. Sometimes, the disorder itself can cause conflicts with others. These conflicts can appear in different areas of our relationships. 
* Family relationships are important because having a supportive family makes life easier. They&#x27;re there for you no matter what, whether things are going great or not so great. When life gets tough, hearing comforting words from your mom, spouse, or siblings can help you feel better and give you the courage to face challenges. In this post, we&#x27;re going to talk about why family is important, what makes a good family, and how to make your relationships with family members stronger.
* Social relationships are the connections between people like family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. When scientists study how relationships affect human health and behavior, they usually focus on these close connections, not just formal ones like with doctors or lawyers. They are interested in how people interact with their social circle and how it impacts them overall.
* Work relationship: Work friendships are special connections between people at work. They are important because they affect the people involved and the company they work for. Friendships at work play a big role in how well someone does their job and how motivated they are. These relationships can be complicated, happening both at work and outside of it, and they can be good or bad. Not having any work friends can make someone feel really lonely and left out.
* Religious relationship: Religion can have a significant impact on relationships. Couples who share the same religious beliefs can find comfort and support in their faith. For example, they might pray together when they are arguing, which can help them deal with their feelings. Studies have shown that couples who pray together tend to focus more on what they have in common rather than their own individual worries. Having a strong religious foundation can also help couples get through difficult situations, like cheating. They might feel like their relationship is special because they believe it is part of God&#x27;s plan for them. Overall, when couples share the same religious beliefs, it can make it easier for them to talk about their faith and support each other in their relationship. 
*A sexual relationship, also called an intimate relationship, is when two people have a close bond either physically or emotionally. Intimacy usually means being close in a special way, and while it often involves sex, it can also happen in relationships without any sexual attraction, like between friends or family members.

==Importance of positive social environments and relationships for parents==
Where a child grows up and goes to school has a big impact on who they become friends with and how good those friendships are. Most of the time, kids make friends with people in their family or neighborhood. So, where parents choose to live, work, and send their kids to school can affect how healthy and happy their children are.

==Solidarity==

People with the same social environment often develop a sense of social solidarity; people often tend to trust and help one another, and to congregate in social groups. They will often think in similar styles and patterns, even though the conclusions which they reach may differ.

==Natural/artificial environment==

In order to enrich their lives, people have used natural resources, and in the process have brought about many changes in the natural environment. Human settlements, roads, farmlands, dams, and many other elements have all developed through the process. All these man-made components are included in human cultural environment, Erving Goffman in particular emphasising the deeply social nature of the individual environment. There are still many people living in villages and this is their social environment. A village is a township with production, living, ecology and culture. The state is trying to solve the problem of integrated rural development, which includes construction, expansion, and road building.

==Milieu/social structure==

C. Wright Mills contrasted the immediate milieu of jobs/family/neighborhood with the wider formations of the social structure, highlighting in particular a distinction between &quot;the personal troubles of milieu&quot; and the &quot;public crises of social structure&quot;.

Emile Durkheim took a wider view of the social environment (&quot;milieu social&quot;), arguing that it contained internalized expectations and representations of social forces/social facts: &quot;Our whole social environment seems to be filled with forces which really exist only in our own minds&quot; – collective representations.

==Phenomenology==

Phenomenologists contrast two alternative visions of society, as a deterministic constraint (&quot;milieu&quot;) and as a nurturing shell (&quot;ambiance&quot;).

Max Scheler distinguishes between milieu as an experienced value-world, and the objective social environment on which we draw to create the former, noting that the social environment can either foster or restrain our creation of a personal milieu.

==Social surgery==

Pierre Janet saw neurosis in part as the product of the identified patient&#x27;s social environment – family, social network, work etc. – and considered that in some instances what he termed &quot;social surgery&quot; to create a healthier environment could be a beneficial measure.

Similar ideas have since been taken up in community psychiatry and family therapy.

<text>Chadwell Heath is an area in East London, England. It is split between the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and the London Borough of Redbridge, around west of Romford and east of Ilford, and north-east of Charing Cross.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &#x27;Chadwell&#x27; was first recorded in 1254 as &quot;Chaudewell&quot; and means &#x27;the cold spring&#x27;. The name was first applied to a settlement on the Barking (later Ilford) side of the ancient boundary between Dagenham and Barking and it was also known as Chadwell Street, &#x27;Street&#x27; having the older meaning of a hamlet. In the 17th century the Blackheath Common in Dagenham parish was renamed Chadwell Heath. As the settlements merged the Chadwell Street name was lost in favour of Chadwell Heath.

===Economic development===
The London to Colchester Roman road led to some early development while much of the rest of the area remained rural.

The railway was constructed through the area from Romford and Ilford and in 1864 Chadwell Heath Railway Station was opened. It was the end of the line for both the London tram system and later the electric trolley bus service from Aldgate. The trolley buses turned around at Station Road and Wangey Road.

Suburban growth commenced in 1900 and proceeded rapidly until World War I, increasing after the war.
===Local government===

Chadwell Heath formed a hamlet in the ancient parish of Dagenham, Essex. As Chadwell Heath grew it absorbed the neighbouring hamlet of Chadwell Street in the Chadwell ward of the parish of Barking. The Barking section of Chadwell Heath became part of the new parish of Ilford in 1888. This became Ilford Urban District in 1894. The Dagenham section became part of Romford Rural District in 1894. The parish was removed from the rural district and became Dagenham Urban District in 1926. During the 1920s and 1930s, the local government arrangements of the area came under review and various proposals would have merged the two sections of Chadwell Heath into a single district, however this was not acted upon.

Ilford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1926 and Dagenham was incorporated in 1938. The arrangements of the area were reviewed again in the 1950s and 1960s. The whole area was considered to form part of the Greater London conurbation and in 1957 formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. Following the review, in 1965 the London Government Act 1963 abolished the municipal boroughs of Dagenham and Ilford, and transferred their former area from Essex to Greater London, to form part of the new London Borough of Barking and the London Borough of Redbridge.

===During the world wars===
The area suffered several bomb hits during World War II. A large parachute mine also exploded causing extensive residential damage in Bennett Road, destroying the school, while a second failed to explode and its parachute became entangled in horse-chestnut trees near Chadwell Heath Station. It did not explode because it was cradled in very soft soil as the result of digging near Hemmings Bakery. It was found by Walter Wiffen, a train guard from Cedar Park Gardens on his way to work at the station early the next morning. He reported it at the police station, which is now the Eva Hart pub, and oversaw the evacuation of Cedar Park Gardens to the bomb shelter at the corner of Wangey Road and the High Road. A V2 rocket landed on Blackbush Avenue killing several people and blowing out windows for half a mile around. Later, the local council replaced the windows with much more modern frames, and the results provided an incongruous look to the older house designs. A heavy anti-aircraft battery was located east of Whalebone Lane North and traces of the concrete emplacements remain today. A V2 Rocket destroyed two houses in Woodlands Avenue and damaged the houses that had been repaired after the landmine that had destroyed the Whalebone Junior school in Bennett Road.

==Demographics==
In the 2011 census, the combined wards of Chadwell in Redbridge and Chadwell Heath in Barking and Dagenham had a total population of 24,278 people.

The two combined wards had no single ethnic majority, with the largest group being White British people comprising 44.3% of the population. The next largest groups were Indians (9.5%), Black Africans (9.3%), Black Caribbeans (5.7%), Bangladeshis (5.6%), Pakistanis (5.5%) and Other Whites (5.2%).

==Geography==
Chadwell Heath is split between the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking &amp; Dagenham. Most of the major buildings, such as the local school and former police station lie in the London Borough of Redbridge. Royal Mail includes Chadwell Heath as part of the RM6 postcode district and the Post Town of Romford.

The area has 3 allotments: one adjacent to St Chad&#x27;s Park on Alexandra Road, the other on Chadwell Heath Lane, and the third in Little Heath next to the Eastern Avenue/A12.

The local school is Chadwell Heath Academy, but there are many other large schools nearby, such as Mayfield School and Chadwell Heath Primary School.

==Transport==
Chadwell Heath is served by London Buses and the Elizabeth Line at Chadwell Heath Railway Station. London Buses routes that serve Chadwell Heath are the 62 from Marks Gate &#x27;Billet Road&#x27; to Barking &#x27;Gascoigne Estate&#x27;; 86 from Romford Station to Stratford Station; 173 from King George Hospital &#x27;Goodmayes&#x27; to Beckton Station; 362 from King George Hospital &#x27;Goodmayes&#x27; to Grange Hill Station; 368 from Chadwell Heath &#x27;Police Station&#x27; to Barking &#x27;Harts Lane&#x27; and night bus N86 from Stratford Station to Harold Hill &#x27;Dagnam Park Square&#x27;.

== The Eva Hart Public House==
Eva Hart (died 1996) lived in Chadwell Heath for a large part of her life. She was one of the few people who survived the sinking of the Titanic. 
The former police station at 1128 High Road Chadwell Heath (&quot;Police&quot; can still be seen on the frieze of the building) was renovated and converted into a pub, and named after her.

== St Chad&#x27;s Park ==

The local park is St Chad&#x27;s Park, a 1/4km2 sized field lined with trees. It is the oldest park in Barking and Dagenham, being laid in 1830. It contains an outdoor gym for public use. 

==Embassy Cinema==

There is an Art Deco former cinema on Chadwell Heath High Road, built in May 1934. It was originally called the Embassy Cinema; later it became part of the Gaumont British Circuit. During the late 1960s, it was converted into a Bingo Hall - known to many locals as the Mecca Bingo Hall. In August 2017, the building was listed as an Asset of Community Value by the &#x27;Chadwell Heath South Residents&#x27; Association&#x27;. The premises currently [when?] house Mayfair Venue, an events centre.

==Religion==
The Roman Catholic Church of St Bede is on Bishops Avenue. St Chad&#x27;s Church (Church of England) stands on St Chad&#x27;s Road. Chadwell Heath has 2 baptist churches. Other churches include the United Reformed Church (URC), and the Brethren Assembly in Wangey Road.

==Sport==
West Ham United&#x27;s training ground was located in the area until late 2015. On 10 December 2015, Slaven Bilic, the then manager of West Ham, announced that from the 14 December the club would be moving from the old training ground (at Saville Road) to the new training ground at nearby Rush Green, London.
Chadwell Heath is also home to St.Chad&#x27;s Bowling Club. In 2023 it became the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham&#x27;s sole surviving outdoor bowling club. Situated in St. Chad&#x27;s Park the bowling club was founded well over 60 years ago.

<doc id="558743" wikidata="Q229765" url="?curid=558743" title="Zun">
<text>The zun or yi, used until the Northern Song (960–1126) is a type of Chinese ritual bronze or ceramic wine vessel with a round or square vase-like form, sometimes in the shape of an animal, first appearing in the Shang dynasty. Used in religious ceremonies to hold wine, the zun has a wide lip to facilitate pouring. Vessels have been found in the shape of a dragon, an ox, a goose, and more. One notable zun is the He zun () from the Western Zhou.

==Function and use==
The zun is a vessel used as a ritual container to hold wine in ancient Chinese. It is a tall wine cup, with no handles or legs. The mouth of the vessel is normally seen as broader than the rest of the body. As a ritual container, its function is to provide the offering of wine to the deceased through ceremonial practices. Depending on the type of zun vessel, for example the Xi zun, not only was it used to store wine but also used to keep the wine warm. This is the only bronze piece discovered known to combine the two functions.

==Symbolism==
The zun comes in various shapes, notably as a round or square vase-like form. Through these forms they appear in unique shapes varying different animals. Often, these vessels are found with distinctive and defined decor with unique symbolism. The most noticeable symbol through the decor is the taotie, known as the demon-face or the face of a sacrificial animal in early Chinese art. This type of face is a common motif found in Chinese ritual bronzes during the Shang dynasty. It has also been defined as a mask, vividly shown as two symmetrical bodies that are joined together. The most visible feature of the mask on the vessel is the protruding animal eyes projecting from the bronze surface in which stares at the viewer. These protruding eyes has also been defined as the eyes of a predator. These animal designs are also iconographically meaningful as the images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses (who were believed to have mythical powers) in the tasks of Heaven-Earth, and with the dead-living communication.

==Ceramic forms==
The zun can be seen in a variety of different vessel forms from a limited amount of decoration to detailed. Some are square, some cylindrical while others are modeled after animals. Some of the animals they are modeled after are an elephant, ox, sheep, horse, rhinoceros and a bird. The basic shape used throughout many is cylindrical and the shape itself is repeated but with modifications. Some Zuns are tall and slender while others may be short and round. The decoration used on the vessels varies not only in content but the relief height. The height of the relief may give off the impression of texture or it may emphasize the form of the vessel by being smooth and round like the vessel. The taller vessel forms may have flanges on the sides that start at the upper lip and follow down to the foot of the vessel.

==Historical and cultural references==

Some characteristics of early Shang zuns consisted of a flaring mouth, high neck and a large body. Shang zuns also had wide shoulders and a foot ring. During the early Western Zhou, there was a zun modeled after a gu but was thicker, larger and the body portion is swelled more than that of a gu. Flanges appear on the vessels body and neck while the same decoration is used. The shoulders consist of small animal heads. Late Shang to Early Zhou Zuns are slim. The flanges start from the mouth of the vessel and down the body ending before the foot ring. The flanges are identical showing symmetry. Early Western Zhou zun are shorter, rounder and smoother. The relief of the vessel emphasizes the form removing the flanges. The bird motif is more prominent now than in the previous vessels.

==Important examples==

===Four-goat Square Zun===
:Period: Shang dynasty
:Overall Height: 58.3 cm
:Weight: 34 kg
:Location: National Museum of China, Beijing

The square zun was excavated in 1938 from Yueshanpu, Ningxiang, Hunan Province. It has a generous mouth with a flared flat lip, a long neck, projecting shoulder, shallow belly and high ring foot. There are flanges on the four corners and in the middle of all four sides. The neck has a design of triangular one-legged dragons and the flanges become the noses of the animal face designs below, with curly horns, round protruding eyes and a scrolled tail. On the shoulder are high-relief designs of dragons with their three-dimensional heads on the centre and their bodies wriggling along the sides. On the four corners of the shoulder are four protruding rams’ heads with curly horns, the belly of the vessel forming their chests and their legs extending down the ring foot. Their heads have engraved thunder patterns while there are scales on their chests and backs. Both sides are decorated with an elegant design of a bird with a high crest. The ring foot also carries a design of one-legged dragons. This vessel combines the techniques of engraving, high relief and three-dimensional relief in a dignified and refined form with intricately worked designs. It is a perfect fusion of moulding and artistic design representing the very best of bronze-making by the traditional clay mould technique.

===Fu Hao owl-shaped Zun===
:Period: Late Shang dynasty
:Overall Height: 46.3 cm
:Mouth Wide: 16.1 cm
:Location: National Museum of China, Beijing
It was excavated in 1976 from the tomb of Fu Hao, Anyang, Henan Province. This bronze wine vessel with the design of owl, a ferocious bird, belongs to those with bird and beast designs. The whole vessel uses thunder pattern as the background, the beak and breast carry cicada pattern, the two sides of the neck carry the Kui pattern (Kui is a legendary dragon with one horn and one foot), the wings carry snake pattern and the tail has the design of a flying owl. The whole piece has rich, delicate and diverse patterns. In appearance, this owl looks solemn and powerful with its two legs and tail form a triangle support the vessel. The shape is firm and lifelike. It is a perfect combination of plane and three-dimensional designs. Inside the vessel&#x27;s mouth are two inscribed characters “Fuhao”, the name of a woman. The oracle inscriptions during the reign of the King Wuding of the Shang Dynasty have many records about this woman. Being the wife of the king, Fuhao involved herself in major state affairs, participated in wars, and presided over sacrificial ceremonies. She led troops to conquer many parts of the country, thus enjoying an illustrious status and being a legendary figure.

===Dragon and tiger Zun===
:Period: Late Shang dynasty
:Overall Height: 50.5 cm
:Diameter at mouth: 44.7cm, Diameter at foot: 24 cm
It was excavated in 1957 from Yueyahe, Funan, Anhui Province. This is a tall and large zun, with a trumpet-shaped mouth, girded neck, broad sloping shoulder, belly which narrows at the bottom, and a high ring foot. The neck is decorated with three narrow bands, the shoulder with three protruding wriggling dragons with upright conical horns, open mouths, extended bodies and coiled tail. Behind their tails is another small dragon design. The belly has a design of a tiger, with raised head in high relief and bodies in shallower relief, extending on both sides of the head. Below the tiger&#x27;s head is a squatting man with arms raised above his shoulders, his head inside the jaw of the tiger. Below both designs is an animal face design with the corner flange of the vessel forming its nose, T-shaped horns and a scrolled tail. The ring foot has three cross-shaped piercings and, on the lower part, animal face designs. The mixture of the techniques of engraving, high relief and three-dimensional relief on the shoulder and belly combined with the delicate and beautiful designs make this a masterpiece of Shang bronze work. In ancient times, non-Chinese peoples lived in Huaiyi Region, where this piece was excavated, and it shows the influence of Shang bronzes combined with local features.

===Ritual wine container (zun) with masks, dragons, and birds===
:Period: Late Shang dynasty, Middle Anyang period, ca. 12th century B.C.E.
:Overall Height: 36.6 cm
:Wide: 37.4 cm
:Weight: 34 kg
:Location: Freer Gallery of Art F1951.19
This example probably excavated from Anyang, Henan province, China. And it used to belong to C.T. Loo &amp; Co., New York, from at least May 11, 1949. Then Freer Gallery of Art purchased it from C. T. Loo on November 28, 1951.

===Zun with dragons===
:Period: Western Zhou dynasty
:Overall Height: 20.5 cm
:Wide: 17.5 cm
:Location: Freer Gallery of Art F1911.40, purchased from C.T. Loo on December 8, 1943

===Zun Pan Set===
:Period: Early Warring Period
:Height of Zun: 33.1cm
:Wide of Zun: 62cm
:Height of Pan: 24cm
:Wide of Pan: 57.6cm
:Depth of Pan: 12cm
:Weight: 28.2 kg
:Location: Hubei Museum, Hubei
The bronze zun-pan set from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (433 BC) unearthed in Suizhou, Hubei in 1978. This is the most exquisite and complex bronze ever found. The set was probably created for an earlier marquis whose name has been erased and replaced by the Marquis of Yi.
The Zun Pan set has various decorations on the plate. The bronze Zun is made of 34 parts, which are cast and welded in 56 places. A total of 56 &quot;Panlong&quot; and 48 &quot;Panchi&quot; are decorated on the body of the Pan, and a seven-character inscription is engraved on the bottom of the neck of Zun and the bottom of Pan.
===He zun===
:Period: Western Zhou
:Overall Height: 38.8 cm
:Weight: 14.6 kg
:Location: Baoji Museum, Shaanxi

He Zun, renowned for the written characters meaning &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;, that is, &quot;China&quot; () in a bronze inscription on the bottom, is one of the most important and well-known Chinese bronze vessels of the Western Zhou. It was discovered by chance and its value hadn&#x27;t been recognized for a long time after it was unearthed. Now He Zun is one of the precious cultural relics which can never be exhibited overseas as expressly provided by Chinese government.
This vessel describes the establishment of a royal residence at the new capital five years after King Cheng assumed the throne. The inscription, which is unclear in parts, was composed by He, who received a speech and gifts from the King. We do not know who his father was nor what role he played in the Zhou conquest, but it is possible that He and his lineage were originally not members of the Zhou tribe. The inscription is particularly interesting in that it demonstrates that the primacy of the deity Tian was already established. “Tian” is a Zhou term for the highest divine force; Shang oracle texts employed the term “Di” in a similar sense.

When the King had completed his address, he bestowed upon He thirty strings of cowries, wherefore has been cast this precious sacrificial vessel for X Gong.

===Lidded ritual wine container (zun) in the form of a bird===
:Period： Middle Eastern Zhou dynasty
:Overall height：26.5 cm
:Wide: 13.5 cm
:Deep: 20 cm
:Location: Freer Gallery of Art F1961.30a-b
This example was reportedly excavated near Taiyuan, Shanxi province, China. To 1915:Marcel Bing (1875–1920), Paris, to 1915. From 1915 to 1961: Eugene (1875–1959) and Agnes E. (1887–1970) Meyer, Washington, D.C., and Mt. Kisco, New York, purchased jointly with Charles L. Freer (1854–1919) from Marcel Bing through C.T. Loo, Lai Yuan &amp; Co., New York, in December 1915. From 1961: Freer Gallery of Art, gift of Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer, 1961.

===Xi Zun [One]===
:Period: Late Spring and Autumn
:Overall Height: 33.7cm 
:Length: 58.7cm
:Weight: 10.76kg
:Location: Shanghai Museum, Shanghai
Xi () in ancient Chinese means solid coloured animals used as sacrifice. This vessel is shaped like a vivid ox, which is strong and steady. There are three holes on the ox&#x27;s back. The middle hole can hold a small wine pot so hot water can be poured into the hollow belly from other two holes. On this basis, researcher infer that Xi Zun might be used to warm wine. Xi Zun is extremely unusual because of its distinctive style and design. This example is the most famous one but not the only one.

===Xi Zun [Two]===

:Period: Middle Western Zhou dynasty
:Overall Height: 24 cm
:Length: 38 cm
:Depth of Belly: 10.7 cm
:Location: Shaanxi History Museum, Xi&#x27;an

This example was excavated in 1967 from Hejiacun, Qishan County, Shaanxi. It is a wine container shaped like an ox as well, but with
a square hole on its back and a tiger-shaped lid. The tail of the ox is the handle. The exaggerated mould is very magnificent.

===Gold and silver inlay cloud-patterned rhinoceros Zun===

:Period: Western Han (206 BC – AD 8)
:Overall Height: 34.4 cm
:Length: 58.1 cm
:Location: National Museum of China, Beijing

It was excavated in 1963 from Doumacun, Xingping, Shaanxi Province. This vessel is in the form of a powerful standing rhinoceros with a raised head with pricked ears and sharp tusks. Its eyes are bright black glass beads, giving it a graceful expression. The lid on its back is hinged at the front allowing it to be opened. Cloud decorations cover the entire body with spirals in between, all inlaid with gold and silver, suggesting the fine hairs of the rhinoceros. This is a realistic piece with flowing and lively decoration, and deserves to be considered a masterpiece of Western Han gold and silver inlay.

<doc id="558750" wikidata="Q1662868" url="?curid=558750" title="Lumpers and splitters">
<text>Lumpers and splitters are opposing factions in any academic discipline that has to place individual examples into rigorously defined categories. The lumper–splitter problem occurs when there is the desire to create classifications and assign examples to them, for example, schools of literature, biological taxa, and so on. A &quot;lumper&quot; is a person who assigns examples broadly, judging that differences are not as important as signature similarities. A &quot;splitter&quot; makes precise definitions, and creates new categories to classify samples that differ in key ways.

==Origin of the terms==
The earliest known use of these terms was thought to be Charles Darwin, in a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1857: &quot;It is good to have hair-splitters &amp; lumpers&quot;. But according to research done by the deputy director at NCSE, Glenn Branch, the credit is due to naturalist Edward Newman who wrote in 1845, &quot;The time has arrived for discarding imaginary species, and the duty of doing this is as imperative as the admission of new ones when such are really discovered. The talents described under the respective names of &#x27;hair-splitting&#x27; and &#x27;lumping&#x27; are unquestionably yielding their power to the mightier power of Truth.&quot;

They were then introduced more widely by George G. Simpson in his 1945 work &quot;The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals&quot;. As he put it:
A later use can be found in the title of a 1969 paper &quot;On lumpers and splitters ...&quot; by the medical geneticist Victor McKusick.

Reference to lumpers and splitters in the humanities appeared in a debate in 1975 between J. H. Hexter and Christopher Hill, in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;. It followed from Hexter&#x27;s detailed review of Hill&#x27;s book &quot;Change and Continuity in Seventeenth Century England&quot;, in which Hill developed Max Weber&#x27;s argument that the rise of capitalism was facilitated by Calvinist Puritanism. Hexter objected to Hill&#x27;s &quot;mining&quot; of sources to find evidence that supported his theories. Hexter argued that Hill plucked quotations from sources in a way that distorted their meaning. Hexter explained this as a mental habit that he called &quot;lumping&quot;. According to him, &quot;lumpers&quot; rejected differences and chose to emphasize similarities. Any evidence that did not fit their arguments was ignored as aberrant. Splitters, by contrast, emphasised differences, and resisted simple schemes. While lumpers consistently tried to create coherent patterns, splitters preferred incoherent complexity.

==Usage in various fields==

===Biology===
The categorization and naming of a particular species should be regarded as a &quot;hypothesis&quot; about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two named species are agreed to be of the same species, the older species name is almost always retained dropping the newer species name honoring a convention known as &quot;priority of nomenclature&quot;. This form of lumping is technically called synonymization. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called splitting. Taxonomists are often referred to as &quot;lumpers&quot; or &quot;splitters&quot; by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognizing differences or commonalities between organisms.

For example, the number of genera used in Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG) I has proved controversial. PPG I uses 18 lycophyte and 319 fern genera. The earlier system put forward by Smith et al. (2006) had suggested a range of 274 to 312 genera for ferns alone. By contrast, the system of Christenhusz &amp; Chase (2014) used 5 lycophyte and about 212 fern genera. The number of fern genera was further reduced to 207 in a subsequent publication. Defending PPG I, Schuettpelz et al. (2018) argue that the larger number of genera is a result of &quot;the gradual accumulation of new collections and new data&quot; and hence &quot;a greater appreciation of fern diversity and [..] an improved ability to distinguish taxa&quot;. They also argue that the number of species per genus in the PPG I system is already higher than in other groups of organisms (about 33 species per genus for ferns as opposed to about 22 species per genus for angiosperms) and that reducing the number of genera as Christenhusz and Chase propose yields the excessive number of about 50 species per genus for ferns. In response, Christenhusz &amp; Chase (2018) argue that the excessive splitting of genera destabilises the usage of names and will lead to greater instability in future, and that the highly split genera have few if any characters that can be used to recognize them, making identification difficult, even to generic level. They further argue that comparing numbers of species per genus in different groups is &quot;fundamentally meaningless&quot;.

=== History ===
In history, lumpers are those who tend to create broad definitions that cover large periods of time and many disciplines, whereas splitters want to assign names to tight groups of inter-relationships. Lumping tends to create a more and more unwieldy definition, with members having less and less mutually in common. This can lead to definitions which are little more than conventionalities, or groups which join fundamentally different examples. Splitting often leads to &quot;distinctions without difference&quot;, ornate and fussy categories, and failure to see underlying similarities.

For example, in the arts, &quot;Romantic&quot; can refer specifically to a period of German poetry roughly from 1780 to 1810, but would exclude the later work of Goethe, among other writers. In music it can mean every composer from Hummel through Rachmaninoff, plus many that came after.

=== Software modelling ===
Software engineering often proceeds by building models (sometimes known as model-driven architecture). A lumper is keen to generalize, and produces models with a small number of broadly defined objects. A splitter is reluctant to generalize, and produces models with a large number of narrowly defined objects. Conversion between the two styles is not necessarily symmetrical. For example, if error messages in two narrowly defined classes behave in the same way, the classes can be easily combined. But if some messages in a broad class behave differently, every object in the class must be examined before the class can be split. This illustrates the principle that &quot;splits can be lumped more easily than lumps can be split&quot;.

=== Language classification ===
There is no agreement among historical linguists about what amount of evidence is needed for two languages to be safely classified in the same language family. For this reason, many proposed language families have had lumper–splitter controversies, including Altaic, Pama–Nyungan, Nilo-Saharan, and most of the larger families of the Americas. At a completely different level, the splitting of a mutually intelligible dialect continuum into different languages, or lumping them into one, is also an issue that continually comes up, though the consensus in contemporary linguistics is that there is no completely objective way to settle the question.

Splitters regard the comparative method (meaning not comparison in general, but only reconstruction of a common ancestor or protolanguage) as the only valid proof of kinship, and consider genetic relatedness to be the question of interest. American linguists of recent decades tend to be splitters.

Lumpers are more willing to admit techniques like mass lexical comparison or lexicostatistics, and mass typological comparison, and to tolerate the uncertainty of whether relationships found by these methods are the result of linguistic divergence (descent from common ancestor) or language convergence (borrowing). Much long-range comparison work has been from Russian linguists belonging to the Moscow School of Comparative Linguistics, most notably Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Sergei Starostin. In the United States, Greenberg and Ruhlen&#x27;s work has been met with little acceptance from linguists. Earlier American linguists like Morris Swadesh and Edward Sapir also pursued large-scale classifications like Sapir&#x27;s 1929 scheme for the Americas, accompanied by controversy similar to that today.

=== Religious studies ===
Paul F. Bradshaw suggests that the same principles of lumping and splitting apply to the study of early Christian liturgy. Lumpers, who tend to predominate in this field, try to find a single line of successive texts from the apostolic age to the fourth century (and later). Splitters see many parallel and overlapping strands which intermingle and flow apart so that there is not a single coherent path in the development of liturgical texts. Liturgical texts must not be taken solely at face value; often there are hidden agendas in texts.

The idea of a single Hindu religion is essentially a lumper&#x27;s concept, sometimes also known as Smartism (on the basis of the Smārta synthesis). Hindu splitters, and individual adherents, often identify themselves on the other hand as adherents of a religion such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism, or Shaktism, according to which deity they believe to be the supreme creator of the universe.

Various &quot;holistic&quot; approaches to religion can prioritise themes such as individual spirituality,
the New-Age-style essential oneness of multiple religious traditions, or religious fundamentalism.

===Philosophy===

Physicist and philosophy writer Freeman Dyson has suggested that one can broadly, if over-simplistically, divide &quot;observers of the philosophical scene&quot; into splitters and lumpers – roughly corresponding to materialists (who imagine the world as divided into atoms) and Platonists (who regard the world as made up of ideas).

=== Psychiatry ===
In psychiatry, the

&#x27;splitters&#x27; and the &#x27;lumpers&#x27; have fundamentally different approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and classification. First, &#x27;splitters&#x27; emphasise the heterogeneity within the diagnostic categories and argue that this heterogeneity drives the &#x27;splitting&#x27; process&#x27;. &#x27;Lumpers&#x27;, on the other hand, point to the similarities &quot;between&quot; the diagnostic categories, and suggest that these similarities justify the creation of broader entities.

Thus lumpers might see &quot;stress&quot; where splitters could identify (say) worry, grief, or some sort of anxiety disorder.

=== Neuroscience ===
In neuroscience, &quot;uncertainty aversion&quot; and &quot;uncertainty tolerance&quot; in semantic representations appear to correlate with the terms &quot;splitters&quot; and &quot;lumpers&quot; respectively. As neuroscientist Marc-Lluís Vives observes:&quot;Our survival is possible because every day we make use of previously acquired categories to navigate the world. Every single mug we encounter is distinct, but fundamentally the same. Thanks to this powerful capacity to classify distinct stimuli under the same category, we can generalize our knowledge from the previously encountered subset of mugs to a future subset of mugs. However, this also posits a dilemma: Is a glass mug still a mug? That is, what are the defining principles that make something a &quot;mug&quot;? Establishing this is fundamental since it also affects its relationship with its close-neighbors. Conceptualizing a mug as very different from a glass creates a more clear-cut mapping between the input—that is, the stimulus perceived—and the output that a person needs to generate—that is, the response, such as drinking coffee. Classical work in cognitive science demonstrates that the more similar two stimuli are, the harder it is to discriminate them and respond with different behavior.&quot;

=== Artificial intelligence and linguistics ===
Natural language processing, using algorithmic approaches such as Word2Vec, provides a way to quantify the overlap or distinguish between semantic categories between words. This can provide a sense of how often the contexts of words overlap or are dissimilar in general usage.

<doc id="558751" wikidata="Q163398" url="?curid=558751" title="1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)">
<text>The 1st (Polish) Independent Parachute Brigade was a parachute infantry brigade of the Polish Armed Forces in the West under the command of Major General Stanisław Sosabowski, created in September 1941 during the Second World War and based in Scotland.

Originally, the brigade&#x27;s exclusive mission was to drop into occupied Poland in order to help liberate the country. The British government, however, pressured the Poles into allowing the unit to be used in the Western theatre of war. Operation Market Garden eventually saw the unit sent into action in support of the British 1st Airborne Division at the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944. The first Poles were landed by glider from 18 September. Bad weather over England delayed the parachute section of the Brigade until 21 September, when it parachuted into Driel on the South bank of the Rhine. The Poles suffered significant casualties during the next few days of fighting, but still were able, by their presence, to cause about 2,500 German troops to be diverted to deal with them for fear of their supporting the remnants of the 1st Airborne trapped over the lower Rhine in Oosterbeek. Some of the Polish paratroopers, including Stanisław Kulik, managed to get across the Rhine to support the 1st Airborne, but when the retreat order came there were not enough boats to get everyone back across. The Dutch underground then helped shelter some of the paratroopers for around a month, until they could be rescued in Operation Pegasus.

==History==
The Brigade was originally trained close to RAF Ringway and later in Upper Largo in Scotland. It was finally based in Lincolnshire, close to RAF Spitalgate (Grantham) where it continued training until its eventual departure for Europe after D-Day.

The Brigade was formed by the Polish High Command in exile with the aim of its being used to support the Polish resistance during the nationwide uprising, a plan that encountered opposition from the British, who argued that a single brigade would be of no use against the entire German army stationed in Occupied Poland. The pressure of the British government eventually caused the Poles to give in and agree to let the Brigade be used on the Western Front. On 6 June 1944 the unit, originally the only Polish unit directly subordinate to the Polish government-in-exile and thus independent of the British command, was transferred into the same command structure as all other Polish Forces in the West. It was allocated to take part in several operations after the invasion of Normandy, but all of them were cancelled. On 27 July, aware of the imminent Warsaw Uprising, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British government for air support, including dropping the Brigade in the vicinity of Warsaw. This request was refused on the grounds of the aircraft used by the Brigade did not have enough fuel to reach Warsaw, along with the request to use Soviet airfields being denied. Eventually, the Brigade entered combat when it was dropped during Operation Market Garden in September 1944.

During the operation, the Brigade&#x27;s anti-tank battery went into Arnhem on the third day of the battle (19 September), supporting the British paratroopers at Oosterbeek. This left Sosabowski with only PIATs as anti-tank capability. The light artillery battery was left behind in England due to a shortage of gliders. Owing to bad weather and a shortage of transport planes, the drop into Driel was delayed by two days, to 21 September. The British units which were supposed to cover the landing zone were in a bad situation and out of radio contact with the main Allied forces. Finally, the 2nd Battalion, and elements of the 3rd Battalion, with support troops from the Brigade&#x27;s Medical Company, Engineer Company and HQ Company, were dropped under German fire east of Driel. They overran Driel, after it was realised that the Heveadorp ferry had been destroyed. In Driel, the Polish paratroopers set up a defensive &quot;hedgehog&quot; position, from which over the next two nights further attempts were made to cross the Rhine.

The following day, the Poles were able to produce some makeshift boats and attempt a crossing. With great difficulty and under German fire from the heights of Westerbouwing on the north bank of the river, the 8th Parachute Company and, later, additional troops from 3rd Battalion, managed to cross the Rhine in two attempts. In total, about 200 Polish paratroopers made it across in two days, and were able to cover the subsequent withdrawal of the remnants of the British 1st Airborne Division.

Not all of the paratroopers were able to withdraw back across the Rhine, due to the numbers involved and a shortage of boats. Those who were trapped on the German-controlled side were either captured by the Germans or, like Stanisław Kulik, were sheltered by the Dutch underground. They were hidden in various houses in the towns and villages, or in huts or makeshift dens in the woods, for about a month until they were rescued in Operation Pegasus on 22 October 1944.

On 26 September 1944, the members of the Brigade who were on the Allied side of the Rhine (now including the 1st Battalion and elements of the 3rd Battalion, who were parachuted near to Grave on 23 September) were ordered to march towards Nijmegen. The Brigade had lost 25% of its fighting strength, amounting to 590 casualties.

In 1945, the Brigade was attached to the Polish 1st Armoured Division and undertook occupation duties in Northern Germany until it was disbanded on 30 June 1947. The majority of its soldiers chose to stay in exile rather than hazard returning to the new communist Poland.

==Post-war honours==

Shortly after the war, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wanted to honour the Parachute Brigade and wrote her government a request. However, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eelco van Kleffens, opposed the idea. He thought an award for the Poles would upset the relations with the &#x27;Big Three&#x27; and harm national interests.

More than 61 years after World War II, the Brigade was awarded the Military Order of William on 31 May 2006 for its distinguished and outstanding acts of bravery, skill and devotion to duty during Operation Market Garden. The Military Order of William is the highest Dutch military award. Only eleven units have been awarded this honor, of which only two are non-Dutch. The award is now worn by the 6th Airborne Brigade which inherited the battle honours of the brigade.

==Portrayals==
The brigade&#x27;s participation in Market Garden was prominently featured in the book and film of a &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;. General Sosabowski was portrayed by Gene Hackman.

A first-hand account of one of the Polish paratroopers in Market Garden, Stanisław Kulik, is described in the book &quot;From the Soviet Gulag to Arnhem: A Polish Paratrooper&#x27;s Epic Wartime Journey&quot;&quot;.&quot; Stanisław had traveled from the Siberian gulag through Central Asia to the UK, where he had trained as a paratrooper. He was trapped behind enemy lines in Arnhem and the Dutch Underground helped him escape.

<doc id="558754" wikidata="Q725003" url="?curid=558754" title="Shunya Itō">
<text>is a Japanese film director known for starting the &quot;Sasori&quot; / &quot;Female Prisoner Scorpion&quot; series of 1970s exploitation films starring Meiko Kaji. Itō worked for Toei Company for most of his career. In 1972, he won a Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Citation for his first film, &quot;Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion&quot;.

He won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards in 1985 with his film &quot;Gray Sunset&quot;, a story of a man suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This thus became Japan&#x27;s entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film instead of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ran&quot;, which caused a slight uproar in Western media as many critics thought &quot;Ran&quot; had a real chance of winning whereas &quot;Gray Sunset&quot; was not even shortlisted. (Galbraith)

In 1995, he directed &quot;Lupin III: Farewell to Nostradamus&quot;. In 1998, he directed the World War II drama &quot;Pride: The Fateful Moment&quot;, presenting a sympathetic view of Hideki Tōjō on trial at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, attracting accusations of revisionism.

<text>Leyton Grange, in Leyton, east London, is the second most deprived area of the London Borough of Waltham Forest. It include an estate that consists of a 10-storey tower and ten 4-storey courts owned by Forest Homes (see list below).

Leyton Grange is sited in an area of Waltham Forest that overlooks the marshes of the River Lea, east of the city of London.
The Grange was the ancient manor house of Leyton, the name signifying that it was once owned by Stratford Abbey; the first record of it by that name is in 1470. The house was rebuilt in 1720 in the Palladian style to the design of its owner, David Gansel. Leyton Grange was the seat of a branch of the Lane family from 1784 until 1861, when they sold it to the British Land Company who broke it up for development. From approximately 1824 until 1843 the Lanes leased the Grange to William Rhodes, grandfather of Cecil Rhodes. Leyton Grange Estate also has George Mitchell School a school that facilitates the needs of over 1000 students most commonly living in the surrounding area.

Transport

Transport in Leyton Grange Estate is advanced as it allows transportation through the 69 a new electric refurbished line of the TFL which takes you to Walthamstow Central and the 97 which takes you to Stratford.

It now contains a housing estate complex, comprising one 10-storey block and ten 4-storey courts.

<doc id="558764" wikidata="Q2630073" url="?curid=558764" title="Disappearance of Frederick Valentich">
<text>Frederick Valentich () was an Australian pilot who disappeared while on a training flight in a Cessna 182L light aircraft, registered VH-DSJ, over Bass Strait. On the evening of Saturday 21 October 1978, twenty-year-old Valentich informed Melbourne air traffic control that he was being accompanied by an aircraft about above him and that his engine had begun running roughly, before finally reporting: &quot;It&#x27;s not an aircraft.&quot;

There were belated reports of a UFO sighting in Australia on the night of the disappearance; however, the Department of Transport was sceptical that a UFO was behind Valentich&#x27;s disappearance, and some of their officials speculated that &quot;Valentich became disorientated and saw his own lights reflected in the water, or lights from a nearby island, while flying upside down&quot;.

==Frederick Valentich==

Frederick Valentich (9 June 1958 – disappeared 21 October 1978) had about 150 total hours of flying time and held a class-four instrument rating, which authorised him to fly at night, but only &quot;in visual meteorological conditions&quot;. He had twice applied to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), but was rejected because of inadequate educational qualifications. He was a member of the RAAF Air Training Corps, determined to have a career in aviation. 

Valentich was studying part-time to become a commercial pilot but had a poor achievement record, having twice failed all five commercial licence examination subjects. As recently as the month before his disappearance, Valentich had failed three more commercial licence subjects. He had been involved in flying incidents, for example, straying into a controlled zone in Sydney, for which he received a warning, and twice deliberately flying into a cloud, for which prosecution was being considered. According to his father, Guido, Valentich was an ardent believer in UFOs and had been worried about being attacked by them. Six days before his disappearance, Valentich discussed with his girlfriend Rhonda Rushton the possibility of a UFO taking him away, according to her.

The destination of Valentich&#x27;s final flight was King Island, but his motivation for the flight is unknown. He told flight officials that he was going to King Island to pick up some friends, while he told others that he was going to pick up crayfish. Later investigations found both stated reasons to be untrue. Valentich had also failed to inform King Island Airport of his intention to land there, going against &quot;standard procedure&quot;.
==Details==

Valentich radioed Melbourne Flight Service at 7:06 pm to report that an unidentified aircraft was following him at . He was told there was no known traffic at that level. Valentich said he could see a large unknown aircraft which appeared to be illuminated by four bright landing lights. He was unable to confirm its type, but said it had passed about overhead and was moving at high speed. Valentich then reported that the aircraft was approaching him from the east and said the other pilot might be purposely toying with him. Valentich said the aircraft was &quot;orbiting&quot; above him and that it had a shiny metal surface and a green light on it. Valentich further reported that he was experiencing engine problems. Asked to identify the aircraft, Valentich radioed: &quot;It&#x27;s not an aircraft.&quot; His transmission was then interrupted by unidentified noise described as &quot;metallic, scraping sounds&quot; before all contact was lost.

==Search and rescue==
A sea and air search was undertaken that included oceangoing ship traffic, an RAAF Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, plus eight civilian aircraft. The search encompassed over . Search efforts ceased on 25 October 1978 without result.

==Official investigation==
An investigation into Valentich&#x27;s disappearance by the Australian Department of Transport was unable to determine the cause but it was &quot;presumed fatal&quot; for Valentich. Five years after Valentich&#x27;s aircraft went missing, an engine cowl flap was found washed ashore on Flinders Island. In July 1983, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation asked the Royal Australian Navy Research Laboratory (RANRL) about the likelihood that the cowl flap might have &quot;travelled&quot; to its ultimate position from the region where the aircraft disappeared. The bureau noted that &quot;the part has been identified as having come from a Cessna 182 aircraft between a certain range of serial numbers&quot;, which included Valentich&#x27;s aircraft.

==Proposed explanations==
Some Western Australia Department of Transport officials speculated that &quot;Valentich became disorientated and saw his own lights reflected in the water, or lights from a nearby island, while flying upside down&quot;.

It has also been proposed that Valentich staged his own disappearance: even taking into account a trip of between 30 and 45 minutes to Cape Otway, the single-engine Cessna 182 still had enough fuel to fly ; despite ideal conditions, at no time was the aircraft plotted on radar, casting doubts as to whether it was ever near Cape Otway; and Melbourne police received reports of a light aircraft making a mysterious landing not far from Cape Otway at the same time as Valentich&#x27;s disappearance.

There has also been speculation that Valentich committed suicide. According to UFOlogist Kieth Basterfield, interviews with doctors and colleagues who knew him virtually eliminated this possibility.

According to Brian Dunning, Valentich&#x27;s radio conversation was similar to the dialogue from a scene in the film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, which was released less than a year before the disappearance, and was popular among pilots, young people and UFO fans. Dunning speculated that it is possible that Valentich was trying to imitate the scene for fun, and deliberately made his aircraft fly in a circular pattern in order to &quot;give the radar guys something to see&quot;, but accidentally became disorientated and crashed into the water.

A 2013 review of the radio transcripts and other data by astronomer and retired United States Air Force pilot James McGaha and author Joe Nickell proposes that the inexperienced Valentich was deceived by the illusion of a tilted horizon for which he attempted to compensate and inadvertently put his aircraft into a downward, so-called &quot;graveyard spiral&quot; which he initially mistook for simple orbiting of the aircraft. According to the authors, the G-forces of a tightening spiral would decrease fuel flow, resulting in the &quot;rough idling&quot; reported by Valentich. McGaha and Nickell also propose that the apparently stationary, overhead lights that Valentich reported were probably the planets Venus, Mars and Mercury, along with the bright star Antares, which would have behaved in a way consistent with Valentich&#x27;s description.

===Ufologists===
Ufologists have claimed that a UFO either destroyed Valentich&#x27;s aircraft or abducted him, saying that some individuals reported seeing &quot;an erratically moving green light in the sky&quot; and that he was &quot;in a steep dive at the time&quot;. Ufologists believe these accounts are significant because of the &quot;green light&quot; mentioned in Valentich&#x27;s radio transmissions. However, the Mt Stromlo Observatory noted that there was a meteorite stream that night, with 10 to 15 sightings per hour.

The group Ground Saucer Watch, based in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, claims that photos taken by plumber Roy Manifold on the day of Valentich&#x27;s disappearance show a fast-moving object exiting the water near Cape Otway Lighthouse. According to UFO writer Jerome Clark, Ground Saucer Watch argued that they showed &quot;a bona fide unknown flying object, of moderate dimensions, apparently surrounded by a cloud-like vapour/exhaust residue&quot;, although the pictures were not clear enough to identify the object. &quot;Snopes&quot; editor Jordan Liles suggested that the object was most likely an “out-of-focus fly” or a &quot;bird passing by&quot;.

<doc id="558768" wikidata="Q662674" url="?curid=558768" title="Barat Daya Islands">
<text>The Barat Daya Islands () are a group of islands in the Maluku province of Indonesia. The Indonesian phrase &quot;barat daya&quot; means &#x27;south-west&#x27;.

==Geography==
These islands are located off the eastern end of East Timor. Wetar is the largest island in the group. To the west, the Ombai Strait separates Wetar from Alor Island, part of East Nusa Tenggara. The Wetar Strait separates Wetar from Timor to the south.

Even though included in the Indonesian Maluku province political division, the southwestern islands are geographically part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Rainfall is limited with a dry season between October and December when some of the islands appear as dry savannah. The Barat Daya Islands except Wetar are part of the Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. Wetar and Timor comprise the Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion. Most of the islands are barren, infertile and minimally forested.

Together with Timor, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, and most of Maluku, the Barat Daya Islands are part of Wallacea, the group of Indonesian islands that are separated by deep water from both the Australian and Asian continental shelves. The islands of Wallacea have never been linked by land to either Asia or Australia, and as a result have few mammals and a mix of flora and fauna from both continents.

=== Islands ===
Among the islands within the archipelago are (from west to east): 
* Liran
* Wetar
* Kisar
* Nyata
* Romang
* Leti Islands (Leti, Moa, Lakor)
* Sermata Islands
* Damer 
* Babar Islands

=== Populated places ===

* Layoni (Teun Island)

==Geology==
The islands are part of the Inner Banda Arc, a volcanic island arc created by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Romang and Damar are volcanic; Wetar consists mostly of oceanic crust that was pushed to the surface by the colliding plates. The Barat Daya and Banda islands constitute an inner arc; the outer arc, which includes Timor, the Tanimbar Islands, and the Kai Islands, is mostly made up of oceanic crust lifted up by the collision, and wraps around south and east of the inner arc.

==History==
Unlike much of the rest of the Maluku Islands, the Barat Daya Islands did not participate in the inter-island trade over the centuries. Damar was the region&#x27;s only island to have produced spice. Too remote from the centre of the Malukan spice trade, the Dutch destroyed the nutmeg trees on Babar. Bugis and Makarassarese annually sailed to coral-rich Luang to purchase reef products such as trepang and mother of pearl.

== Administration ==
The Maluku Barat Daya Regency is administratively composed of seventeen districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), whose areas (in km2) and 2013 officially estimated populations are listed below.:
The districts are formally grouped into three archipelagoes – the Terselatan Group (including Wetar, as well as Kisar and Romang Islands), the Lemola Group (Letti, Moa and Lakor) and the Babar Group (including the Damer and Sermata Islands). The areas (in km2) and the populations at the 2010 census and 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023, are listed below. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 117 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 1 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; – the latter being Tiakur on Moa Island), and its post code.

Notes: &lt;br&gt;(a) the 2010 populations for the four districts which comprised Pulau Pulau Wetar District are listed under Wetar Selatan District. &lt;br&gt;(b) the 2010 populations of Kisar Utara and Kepulauan Roma Districts are included under the figure for Kisar Selatan District (formerly called Pulau Pulau Terselatan District), from which they were split off. &lt;br&gt;(c) the 2010 population of Lakor District is included in the figure for Moa District, from which it was split off. &lt;br&gt;(d) the 2010 population of Pulau Wetang District is included in the figure for Babar Barat District (formerly called Pulau Pulau Babar District), from which it was split off. &lt;br&gt;(e) the 2010 populations of Pulau Masela and Daweloor Dawera Districts are included under the figure for Babar Timur District, from which they were split off.

<text>Lea Bridge is a district in the London Borough of Hackney and the London Borough of Waltham Forest in London, England. It lies 7 miles (11.3 km) northeast of Charing Cross.

The area it takes its name from a bridge built over the River Lea in either 1745 – or sometime after 1757 – and the Lea Bridge Road which leads through the area and across the bridge. The bridge also gives its name to a ward in Waltham Forest (Lea Bridge) on the eastern, Leyton, bank of the river, and to a ward in Hackney on the Western side of the river, also called Lea Bridge ward. The boundary between the two boroughs runs down the middle of the river at this point.

Within Hackney, Lea Bridge Road forms the customary boundary between Upper and Lower Clapton.

==History==

In 1582 &quot;Mill Fields Lane&quot; ran from Clapton to &quot;Jeremy&#x27;s Ferry&quot; in the Leyton Marshes. At the same spot a timber bridge was built in either 1745, or sometime after 1757. After this, the road became known as &quot;Lea Bridge Road&quot;, with a tollgate at the Clapton end. A toll house was built on the west bank of the river in 1757, and the bridge rebuilt in iron in 1820–1. Tolls continued to be levied until 1872.

Clapton Orient played at the Lea Bridge Stadium between 1930 and 1937 before moving to Brisbane Road. The stadium was also used for speedway and was the home track of the Lea Bridge speedway team. It was demolished in the 1970s and a housing estate built on the site.

==Local area==
There are few crossing points for the Lea Marshes. The nearest major river crossing to the south is at Hackney Wick and to the north at Tottenham Hale.

The area contains large amounts of open space, dominated by the Millfields recreation grounds, one of the largest parks in Hackney, which in 2023 was awarded the Green Flag Award to mark the high standard of the park environment and its maintenance. Along the southern border of the park sits the former coal-fired Millfields power station, now used as electrical sub-stations on the London Ring, and recently upgraded. This was built in 1901, well before the creation of the National Grid in 1938, a period when power had to be generated near to the consumer. It provided electric street lighting throughout the then Metropolitan Borough of Hackney.
Lea Bridge gives ready access to the lower reaches of the extensive Lee Valley Park, which stretches for about on both banks of the river. Next to the south side of the bridge is a pub, the &quot;Princess of Wales&quot; and a Grade *II listed Victorian Old Schoolhouse, built in 1841, which provided free education for the children of &quot;transient boatmen and bargees&quot;, now flats. To the south are the Hackney Marshes, and beyond Leyton Marsh to the north are the Walthamstow Marshes and Nature Reserve. Also to the south is the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, site of the 2012 Olympic Games.

Below the bridge, the river flows over the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, marking the boundary with Leyton and providing the supply for the former East London Waterworks Company. The old Middlesex Filter Beds have been converted into a nature reserve, and on the Leyton side the corresponding Essex Filter Beds are now a reserve for birds. The Lee Navigation continues south in an artificial channel known as &#x27;Hackney Cut&#x27;, to the next lock at Old Ford (about 1.7 miles), where the natural channel rejoins the Navigation after its meander towards Leyton.

To the North of the river is an ice rink, which got a planning application granted (in October 2020) to demolish and replace with a double pad ice rink and other leisure facilities. There is also Oxbow Island, created by the meandering of the river, along the north bank, which is one of the remaining areas of wild land and wildlife in the area and is the responsibility of the Canal &amp; River Trust.

== Geography ==
==Education==
==Transport==

The local station for Lea Bridge is Lea Bridge railway station on the Lea Valley lines. Also close by is Clapton railway station on the Liverpool Street to Chingford line. Lea Bridge Road is well served by buses having seven bus routes in total, two of which are night routes, and one 24-hour route. Buses in the area include routes 55, 56, 58 and W19, with the addition of night routes N38, N55 and 24-hour operated route 158. More recently, there is now a 308 bus which comes from Leabridge roundabout and turns into Chatsworth Road, going to Stratford.

From Leabridge roundabout intersection with Upper and Lower Clapton roads, a number of buses travel south through Hackney, and to the city, and to the north through Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington.

<text>Francis Richard Lubbock (October 16, 1815June 22, 1905) was a businessman, slaveholder, and politician from the American South who played a significant role in Texas history. A South Carolina native, he was a key player in Texas politics, serving as Lieutenant Governor and later the 9th Governor of Texas during the Civil War. As Governor, Lubbock was a fervent supporter of the Confederacy and instrumental in Texas&#x27; secession from the Union. After the war, he continued in public service as the Texas State Treasurer. He was the brother of Thomas Saltus Lubbock, for whom both Lubbock County and the city of Lubbock are named.

==Early life==
Francis Richard Lubbock, born in Beaufort, South Carolina, on October 16, 1815, was the son of Dr. Henry Thomas Willis and Susan Ann (Saltus) Lubbock. His paternal grandfather, Capt. Richard Lubbock, settled in Georgia and was a distinguished member of the masonic fraternity. His maternal grandfather, Capt. Francis Saltus, was a wealthy cotton planter and shipowner in Charleston. Lubbock&#x27;s early education involved various schools and tutors, including an Irish schoolmaster, Patrick Brett, in Beaufort and Edgefield, South Carolina.

As a young boy, Lubbock had the opportunity to witness the visit of General Lafayette to the United States in 1824. His father, commanding the steamboat Henry Schultze, transported Lafayette from Charleston to Augusta. Lubbock&#x27;s participation in the celebrations, including carrying candles in a procession and being presented to General Lafayette, left a lasting impression on him. 

In 1828, the Lubbock family moved to Savannah, Georgia, where Francis&#x27;s father managed the City Hotel. After his father&#x27;s death the following year, the family returned to live in Charleston, where there was a large house that had been left to them.

==Career==
=== South Carolina ===
A year before his father died, Lubbock had started working with him &quot;after school hours assisting him in his accounts and other things that I could attend to intelligently. Here was the beginning of my business education.&quot; Now, at age 14, decided to forgo further schooling to support his family. He parlayed his experience into a clerkship in the hardware establishment of James H. Merritt, who turned out to be a very harsh employer. Nevertheless, Lubbock remained in this clerkship for three years. 

At this time, he was involved in various social, military, and political organizations, including the Young Men&#x27;s State&#x27;s Rights Association. His participation in these activities, along with his work, played a significant role in shaping his political beliefs and personal development. During the Nullification Crisis in 1832-33, Lubbock was actively involved in the political scene in South Carolina. The crisis, which arose from South Carolina&#x27;s opposition to federal tariffs, was a significant event in American history, laying the groundwork for the states&#x27; rights arguments that would later lead to the Civil War. Lubbock&#x27;s experiences during this period further solidified his political stance as a State&#x27;s Rights Democrat.

After his time in Charleston, Lubbock worked briefly with a cousin named F.C. Black at a West India commission house. He later moved to Hamburg, South Carolina, where he worked for Tully F. &amp; H. W. Sullivan. His responsibilities included managing a cotton warehouse, and he also began buying cotton on behalf of a large buyer, earning commissions. This experience further developed his skills in commerce and trade.

=== New Orleans ===
In 1834, after hearing from a mutual acquaintance about the financial opportunities in New Orleans, Lubbock and his friend Charles T. Ketchum, both only 18 years old, relocated there and established the firm of Ketchum &amp; Lubbock, a drugstore. Ketchum, an experienced &quot;druggist&quot;, managed the prescription department, while Lubbock handled bookkeeping and sales. The business, initially successful, expanded into wholesale trade and made ventures into other commodities like castor oil, bacon, lard, sugar, and molasses. &quot;This was a departure from our regular line of trade, and, as is usually the case, proved unremunerative.&quot; Eventually, the business faced financial difficulties due to poor collections and a market downturn in 1836, so the partners decided to liquidate the firm to pay off their creditors. Lubbock secured a job with Whittimore, Blair &amp; Co., a firm dealing in watches, jewelry, silverware, and firearms, with a salary of two thousand dollars per year.

During this time, much was in the news about the events unfolding in Texas. Lubbock&#x27;s brother, Tom Lubbock, who had recently also come to New Orleans, volunteered for the war in Texas. Though disappointed that his brother would leave a favorable situation in Louisiana, Lubbock &quot;fitted him out, and bade him godspeed... Thus he left New Orleans with his company, known as the &#x27;New Orleans Grays,&#x27; the first volunteer company to arrive in Texas from abroad.&quot; After months of hearing no news of Tom from Texas, Lubbock decided to go look for him.

=== Texas ===
After moving to Texas with his wife in late 1836, Lubbock engaged in various business activities, including selling goods in Velasco and assisting in the sale of a captured Mexican schooner&#x27;s cargo. He faced challenges such as selling flour to the government at a low profit and adjusting to market fluctuations, which influenced his decision to relocate from the Brazos to Houston.

Encouraged by the Allen brothers—Augustus Chapman and John Kirby, who had founded the town of Houston only a few months before, Lubbock decided to settle there and set up his business, arriving in January 1837. He established himself as a merchant, dealing in various goods, including the first barrel of flour and sack of coffee sold in Houston. Lubbock invested in real estate, purchasing land and building a storehouse and a small house for his family.

By the summer of 1837, Lubbock found himself with little capital and decided to liquidate his business to pay off his creditors. The timing was providential, as Lubbock was chosen as assistant clerk of the House of Representatives when the Second Congress convened its session in Houston. He was soon after elected chief clerk.

Lubbock actively contributed to the development of Houston, including arranging for the importation of cisterns to improve the city&#x27;s water supply. He sold his storehouse to the government for use as the executive mansion. These acts demonstrated his involvement in the city&#x27;s infrastructure development.

In November of 1837, President Sam Houston appointed Lubbock to be Comptroller, a position he accepted and executed diligently. He oversaw financial matters, including the examination and approval of government claims and the countersigning of stock certificates.

During this time, Lubbock participated in Texas&#x27;s defensive strategies against Mexican forces. He played a key role in a war meeting at the Texas capitol in December 1837, serving as secretary. This meeting, responding to reports of a Mexican advance, aimed to organize defense and support those at the frontline. He was actively involved in forming resolutions and committees for vigilance and correspondence. When Indians were attacking frontier settlements in 1838, Lubbock requested a leave of absence from the President and joined Major George W. Bonnell&#x27;s battalion as adjutant, embarking on a challenging campaign to protect Texas&#x27;s frontier against Indian threats. Despite the difficulties, the battalion&#x27;s efforts contributed to the security of the frontier, with Lubbock highlighting their role in preventing Indian attacks and protecting settlers.

Following the end of Sam Houston&#x27;s term and the onset of Mirabeau Lamar&#x27;s presidency, Lubbock, being aligned with the Houston party, faced political displacement. He was advised to resign from his position as Comptroller, which he did when his successor was appointed. After leaving his position as Comptroller of the Republic, Lubbock engaged in different ventures and remained active in the political scene. This is when Lubbock ventured into farming, which was marked by various challenges and experiences, including a failed attempt to transport his farm produce by boat, which ended in a loss of his crops in Galveston Bay.

In Houston, Lubbock partnered with James W. Scott to run a commission business, becoming the only auction and commission merchants in the city at the time. Their enterprise was diverse, dealing in a wide range of products such as French wines, hardware, groceries, footwear, lumber, sugar, salt, cigars, and coffee. They also engaged in real estate transactions, selling lots and blocks. Lubbock personally took on the role of auctioneer, handling the sale of various items, from small household goods to potentially larger assets like steamboats. Scott was responsible for the financial management, including bookkeeping and fiscal responsibilities. This venture demanded adaptability to meet the diverse needs of their clientele and reinforced Lubbock and Scott&#x27;s engagement with the local community, blending their roles as businessmen with their public prominence, particularly in Lubbock&#x27;s case due to his political activities. Despite the hard work and challenges, Lubbock looked for better opportunities while maintaining an active interest in public affairs.

Lubbock reentered politics as a candidate for the office of District Clerk in Harris County in 1840-41. He utilized a strategic approach, joining William K. Wilson on a tax assessing tour to meet voters, and campaigning vigorously. His efforts paid off, and he was elected as District Clerk, a position he held for over 16 years, thanks to his popularity and effective campaigning.

Lubbock also actively participated in the political scene beyond his direct candidacies. He was involved in supporting presidential candidates, notably General Sam Houston, in 1841. Lubbock was appointed as the secretary in a large meeting of Houston&#x27;s supporters, where he was part of a committee that drafted resolutions to promote Henry Smith as a candidate for Vice-President to align with Houston&#x27;s political aims. When Smith declined, they supported General Edward Burleson, who eventually won the vice-presidency.

During his tenure as the district clerk of Harris County, Lubbock was dedicated to serving with integrity and fairness. He established a principle of not engaging in speculation related to his office and made a conscious effort to treat the public generously. Lubbock was known for his love of horses, which he financed with his own money, without compromising his official duties.

His venture into ranching began in 1841, and it came about due to the scarcity of money and the abundance of livestock used as payment for legal fees. He acquired about 400 acres of land at 75 cents per acre on the south side of Simms&#x27; Bayou, near Houston. Despite initial reservations about the respectability of cattle ranching, Lubbock was determined to give the business respectability and began stocking his ranch with cattle and horses. By 1847, Lubbock moved permanently to his ranch, investing in the improvement of his property with good buildings, fencing, barns, and pastures. The ranch, located near Harrisburg, became a hub of activity and was frequented by neighbors and friends. Lubbock found the ranch life enjoyable, balancing his duties as a clerk and his responsibilities on the ranch.

Lubbock&#x27;s ranching activities included round-ups, where cattle were gathered, branded, and sorted. The marketing of cattle during Lubbock&#x27;s ranching years was challenging due to limited transportation options. Initially, cattle were driven overland to markets like Galveston and Houston, and later shipped to New Orleans via sailboats and steamers. Lubbock, along with his business partner S.W. Allen, was heavily involved in cattle shipping, adapting to the changing transportation methods over time.

Francis R. Lubbock&#x27;s career in the Texas Republic was marked by significant political and administrative roles. He served as the Comptroller of Texas, a position that underscored his involvement in the financial management of the Republic. However, Lubbock chose to resign from this post to retain his role as the Clerk of the District Court of Harris County, an office he preferred due to its proximity to his home and its higher financial rewards.

Lubbock was actively involved in the political landscape of the Texas Republic, particularly during Sam Houston&#x27;s presidency. He was appointed as an aide to President Houston and served on his staff as a colonel of cavalry throughout Houston&#x27;s term. This appointment placed Lubbock in a key position within Houston&#x27;s administration, where he witnessed and contributed to various significant events and decisions.

As a political figure, Lubbock participated in events that celebrated and supported prominent leaders like President-elect Sam Houston. He played a crucial role in organizing a meeting in Houston where Houston was formally offered the freedom of the city. This involvement illustrates Lubbock&#x27;s active participation in the Republic&#x27;s political affairs and his support for its leadership.

Throughout his career, Lubbock was exposed to the challenges faced by the Texas Republic, including financial instability and external threats from Mexico. His tenure as Comptroller and his proximity to Houston&#x27;s administration provided him with insights into the Republic&#x27;s strategies to address these challenges, including fiscal austerity measures and responses to military threats from neighboring Mexico.

In 1857, Lubbock was elected lieutenant governor of Texas as a Democrat, but failed in his re-election bid in 1859. Following the Confederate secession in 1861, Lubbock won the governorship of Texas. During his tenure, he supported Confederate conscription, working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate States Army. He was known to praise the Great Hanging at Gainesville, where in October 1862, some 42 suspected Unionists were murdered, convicted and killed by hanging through sentences by a &quot;Citizens Court&quot; organized by Texas state troops, but not recognized under state law, with some 14 lynched without benefit even of a show trial. It was part of an outbreak of violence, often caused by Confederate or state troops, in North Texas in the early years of the war.

When Lubbock&#x27;s term ended in 1863, he joined the Confederate Army. He was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel, serving under Major General John B. Magruder. By 1864, Lubbock was promoted to&quot; aide-de-camp &quot;for Jefferson Davis. Following the Confederacy&#x27;s military collapse, Lubbock fled from Richmond, Virginia, with Davis. They were soon caught by Union troops in Georgia. He was imprisoned at Fort Delaware with John Reagan and Jefferson Davis for eight months before being paroled.

On his return to Texas, Lubbock continued to pursue business interests in Houston and Galveston. From 1878 to 1891, he served as Texas State Treasurer.

==Death and legacy==
Lubbock died in Austin on June 22, 1905, at the age of 89, making him the last Confederate Governor to die. He is buried at Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

<text>The Pawtucket Red Sox, known colloquially as the PawSox, were a professional minor league baseball club based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. From 1973 to 2020, the team was a member of the International League and served as the Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. They played their home games at McCoy Stadium, and won four league championships, their last in 2014. Following the 2020 season, the franchise moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, to become the Worcester Red Sox.

The Pawtucket Red Sox were born as a Double-A Eastern League franchise in 1970. Three years later, Boston&#x27;s Triple-A affiliate in the International League replaced the Eastern League PawSox. After enduring three different owners, at least two threats to move the team elsewhere, and bankruptcy, the PawSox were purchased from the International League by local industrialist Ben Mondor in January 1977. Over the next 38 years, Mondor (who died in 2010) and his heirs stabilized the franchise and turned it into a success; it was twice (1990 and 2003) selected the winner of &quot;Baseball America&#x27;s&quot; Bob Freitas Award as the top Triple-A operation in minor league baseball, won the 1990 John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, led its league in total attendance three times between 2004 and 2008, and captured three Governors&#x27; Cups as playoff champions.

On February 23, 2015, the team was sold to a group headed by then-Boston Red Sox president and chief executive officer Larry Lucchino and Rhode Island attorney James J. Skeffington. Thwarted in two attempts to replace McCoy Stadium with a new facility (first in adjacent Providence, then in a downtown site in Pawtucket), the club announced on August 17, 2018, that it would move to Worcester, located to the northwest at the opposite end of the Blackstone Valley, in 2021.

On June 30, 2020, it was announced that the 2020 Minor League Baseball season was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Thus, the team last played minor league games in Pawtucket during the 2019 season.

==Team history==

===Eastern League franchise (1970–1972)===
The first team to be dubbed the Pawtucket Red Sox debuted at McCoy Stadium in 1970 as a member of the Double-A Eastern League. The franchise, owned by former Major League shortstop Joe Buzas, had spent the previous five seasons (1965–69) as the Pittsfield Red Sox after playing in four different Pennsylvania cities—Allentown, Johnstown, York and Reading—over seven years (1958–64).

After three seasons, Pawtucket&#x27;s Eastern League franchise moved to Bristol, Connecticut, in 1973 to make room for the Triple-A PawSox, the former Louisville Colonels of the International League.

Carlton Fisk, the future Baseball Hall of Fame catcher, played for the Eastern League PawSox in 1970. Shortstop Rick Burleson and first baseman Cecil Cooper are among the players who toiled for both the Double-A and Triple-A versions of the team. This first edition of the PawSox franchise played for ten seasons as the Bristol Red Sox and then spent 33 seasons (1983–2015) in New Britain, Connecticut, the last 21 of them as the Rock Cats. In 2016, the Rock Cats moved to Connecticut&#x27;s capital city, and were rechristened the Hartford Yard Goats.

The Cleveland Indians had also placed an Eastern League club in Pawtucket, in 1966–67. The Pawtucket Indians moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1968. The Pawtucket Slaters, a Boston Braves farm club in the Class B New England League, represented the city from 1946 to 1949, when the NEL disbanded.

===Roots in Toronto and Louisville===
The Triple-A team that became the Pawtucket Red Sox began in 1896 as the Toronto Maple Leafs. It spent 72 consecutive seasons representing Ontario&#x27;s capital city and won ten league championships before a deteriorating ballpark forced it to relocate to Louisville, Kentucky, following the season.

Louisville had spent the previous five years out of Organized Baseball. After the American Association and its Louisville Colonels franchise folded in 1962 and the American League owners voted down Charlie O. Finley&#x27;s agreement to move the Kansas City A&#x27;s to Louisville in 1964, Louisville was ready for the return of baseball. In 1968 the Maple Leafs, the Red Sox&#x27; top minor league club since 1965, were bought by Walter J. Dilbeck and moved to Louisville where they became the new Louisville Colonels and retained their affiliation with the Red Sox. They played at Fairgrounds Stadium on the Kentucky State Fairgrounds. While in Louisville, star players included Carlton Fisk (1971), Dwight Evans (1972), and Cecil Cooper (1972). The Louisville Colonels made the International League playoffs in 1969 and 1972.

===Early struggles and bankruptcy (1973–1976)===
In 1972, the Kentucky State Fair Board remodeled Cardinal Stadium so it could accommodate football. The renovations made the stadium unsuitable for baseball; among other things, it was far too large for a Triple-A team. However, the stadium was later used by the latter-day Louisville Redbirds club, setting minor league attendance records and outdrawing several major league teams. Following the 1972 season, the Louisville Colonels of the International League moved to McCoy Stadium and became the Pawtucket Red Sox, with Buzas taking over as owner.

The first Triple-A team was a success on the field, led by future major leaguers Cooper and Dick Pole, winning the 1973 Governors&#x27; Cup Championship in their inaugural year in the league over the Charleston Charlies. Then, they followed up by defeating the Tulsa Oilers of the American Association to win the Junior World Series. The following season they finished 30 games below .500 and lost an estimated $40,000. Buzas then sold the team to Philip Anez, a Smithfield advertising executive, in January 1975.

While the parent club was on their way to the 1975 World Series, the 1975 PawSox finished with a 53–87 mark. The team changed its name to the &quot;Rhode Island Red Sox&quot; for the 1976 season, but little changed on the field with a third straight sub-.500 season and falling attendance. Anez threatened to move his club to Jersey City, New Jersey. After the season, the franchise went bankrupt, unable to pay off $2 million worth of debt. The International League took it over, then awarded it in December 1976 to Massachusetts businessman Marvin Adelson, who renamed the team the &quot;New England Red Sox&quot;—and explored transferring it to Worcester. But after less than two months, in January 1977, the league revoked Adelson&#x27;s franchise, alleging &quot;nonperformance of terms and conditions&quot;.

===The Ben Mondor era (1977–2015)===
Although it appeared the Red Sox&#x27;s stay in the Pawtucket area was about to come to an end, retired Lincoln businessman Ben Mondor stepped in and made sure the team remained in the city. Mondor was granted a brand-new franchise and restored the name to the Pawtucket Red Sox. However, it retained the old team&#x27;s history and affiliation with the big-league Red Sox.

Mondor&#x27;s tenure began inauspiciously. While the PawSox rebounded to win the regular-season pennant, they only drew 1,000 fans per game—believed to be the fewest for a first-place team in the history of the International League. That year&#x27;s edition of the PawSox fell in the Governors&#x27; Cup finals to Charleston in four straight games. However, it won its second league championship in 1984, and drew almost 199,000 fans, second in the league.

For most of their first quarter-century in Rhode Island, the PawSox had to devote considerable resources to keeping McCoy Stadium at something approaching Triple-A standards. In 1998, Mondor and team president Mike Tamburro heavily renovated McCoy Stadium. The PawSox led the league in attendance in 2008, when 636,788 fans saw baseball at McCoy, an average of 9,097 for each of the 70 openings. In 2005, they set a franchise record with 688,421 tickets sold during the year. Kevin Youkilis played for the team in 2003, and completed a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate Kevin Millar&#x27;s minor-league records for consecutive games reaching base.

In addition to their success at the box office, the PawSox have excelled on the field. In 2000, Pawtucket set an all-time franchise record for victories with 82, as the team completed their fifth-straight winning season. Three years later the PawSox would top their own record by winning 83 games. In 2008, they won 85 games. The 1984 team defeated the now-defunct Maine Guides 3–2 to win the 1984 Governors&#x27; Cup trophy for their second championship in Pawtucket Red Sox history. In 2012, the PawSox defeated the Charlotte Knights to win the Governors&#x27; Cup for a third time. A fourth title was won in 2014 when the PawSox took down the Durham Bulls in five games.

The origins of the team&#x27;s most popular nickname, &quot;PawSox,&quot; dates to the first season in which Mondor owned the club. Three weeks before the 1977 season began the team lacked uniforms. BoSox vice president Haywood Sullivan stepped in and sent Pawtucket 48 sets of old home and away uniforms from the parent club. Although the home uniforms were fine for the team to use, the road uniforms had &quot;Boston&quot; stitched across the chest, which was a problem. Tamburro suggested using the name &quot;PawSox&quot; across the front, with each unstitched &quot;Boston&quot; letter replaced with one that spelled &quot;PawSox&quot;. Thus, the PawSox name was born out of the necessity of a uniform crisis.

Mondor died on October 3, 2010, at the age of 85. His widow, Madeleine, became the new majority owner of the PawSox.

===Sale and Rhode Island stadium plans (2015–2018)===
On November 29, 2014, it was reported that members of the Boston Red Sox&#x27; ownership group were in the process of purchasing the PawSox from Madeleine Mondor and two long-time executives who also held stock in the team: president Tamburro and vice president and general manager Lou Schwechheimer.

Nearly three months later, on February 23, the sale to Lucchino, Skeffington and their partners was formally announced. Lucchino added the title of chairman of the PawSox to his Boston responsibilities, and Skeffington became club president. Other partners included Rhode Island businessmen Bernard Cammarata, William P. Egan, Habib Gorgi, J. Terrence Murray and Thomas M. Ryan, as well as Fenway Sports Management (a division of the BoSox&#x27; parent company, Fenway Sports Group), and two limited partners in FSG, Arthur E. Nicholas and Frank M. Resnek.

That day, the new owners also announced their intention to move the team out of McCoy Stadium, build a new baseball park six miles (9.65 km) to the south in downtown Providence, and begin play there as early as 2017. Skeffington said the club would be renamed the Rhode Island Red Sox upon the move. That name was previously used by the 1976 edition of the PawSox, before Mondor purchased the team and restored its Pawtucket identity. In the weeks following announcement of the sale, Skeffington led a media tour of the proposed new stadium site on the Providence River and, with Lucchino, served as a point person in negotiations with state and local officials over public financing arrangements for the new park.

However, Skeffington, 73, died from a heart attack while jogging near his Barrington home on May 17, 2015, disrupting the team&#x27;s efforts to secure an agreement with Rhode Island officials. Then, on August 1, Lucchino announced his retirement as the CEO and president of the Boston Red Sox, effective at the end of the season.

In September, Governor Gina Raimondo told Lucchino that the riverfront parcel, consisting of public land formerly occupied by Interstate 195 and private property owned by Brown University, &quot;was not suitable and there were too many obstacles that remained.&quot; In the wake of the setback, Lucchino said that the team preferred to remain in Rhode Island, but neither he nor other PawSox officials immediately commented about possible alternative locations. In the ensuing weeks, reports surfaced that Worcester and two other Massachusetts cities—Springfield and Fall River—might bid for the team.

On November 5, Skeffington&#x27;s position was filled when Dr. Charles Steinberg, longtime Lucchino aide and a senior public affairs and PR executive with four big-league teams, including the Red Sox, became club president. Tamburro remained on board as vice chairman, and Dan Rea III became the PawSox&#x27; new general manager, after Schwechheimer departed to join an ownership group that purchased the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. Amidst the uncertainty over its longterm home, Steinberg committed the team to remaining in Pawtucket for five seasons, through 2020, and to rebuilding its relationship with its fans.

During the summer of 2016, the city, state and team began a feasibility study to determine the extent of needed renovations to McCoy Stadium. That study concluded that renovating McCoy would cost $68 million, while building a new stadium on the site would cost $78 million. On May 16, 2017, a downtown Pawtucket stadium proposal, The Ballpark at Slater Mill, was jointly announced by Lucchino and Pawtucket&#x27;s mayor, Donald Grebien. The ballpark, to be built on a site bracketed by Interstate 95 and the Blackstone River, would cost an estimated $83 million, with the team footing $45 million, the state $23 million, and the city the remaining $15 million. But when the stadium project went before the Rhode Island General Assembly in 2018, the financing formula was amended to shift the risk of borrowing money from the state to investors, thus exposing them to potentially higher interest rates. The amended bill passed, and was signed into law by Raimondo on June 29, 2018.

=== Final season and relocation to Worcester (2019–2021)===
The new financing arrangement was rejected by the PawSox ownership. On August 17, 2018, the team announced that it would relocate to a new stadium in Worcester in April 2021. The stadium was to be part of a $240 million redevelopment of Worcester&#x27;s Kelley Square and Canal District. The move would end the team&#x27;s history in Pawtucket after 51 seasons.

Alluding to &quot;controversy, disagreement and opposition&quot;, apparently on the part of Rhode Island legislators who changed the Pawtucket stadium&#x27;s financing formula, Lucchino said that a 35-page letter of intent had been signed with Worcester&#x27;s mayor and city manager for the downtown ballpark project to house the relocated team. The announcement capped a concerted three-year effort by Worcester and Massachusetts officials and local business leaders to woo the PawSox to anchor a downtown redevelopment that includes the stadium, new housing, a hotel, a parking garage and redesign of the Kelley Square intersection. On September 12, 2018, the Worcester City Council voted 9–1 to approve the stadium proposal, paving the way for the PawSox&#x27; relocation.
During the 2019 season of the International League, Pawtucket finished last in the North Division, with a record of 59–81. The team&#x27;s final game was played on September 2, 2019; it was a 5–4 home victory over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs in 10 innings.
While 2020 was planned to be the team&#x27;s final season of play in the International League, the Minor League Baseball season was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. During the 2020 Major League Baseball season, McCoy Stadium served as the alternate training site for the Boston Red Sox. By December 5, the team began to sell off 1,000 pieces of memorabilia in an online auction hosted on the PawSox website as well as on Cox Cable TV, while also announcing the team would be taking select artifacts to be put on display at Polar Park in Worcester.

The Pawtucket Red Sox&#x27; regular season record over the half-century (1970 through 2019) of their existence was 3,461–3,610, for a winning percentage of .490.

On January 11, 2021, the City of Pawtucket announced that it would be filing a lawsuit against Pawtucket Red Sox Baseball Club LLC for breach of contract, in that McCoy Stadium was not kept up to standards or renovations, citing that &quot;the City of Pawtucket will be exposed for the entire facility and upkeep which was originally the responsibility of the State and PawSox, leaving the burden on the taxpayers to fix or knock down the facility,&quot;
In a statement, the PawSox were &quot;Stunned to learn of this unfounded lawsuit from our friends and long-time partners at the City of Pawtucket, We will now allow the legal process to run its course, and therefore have no further comment at this time.&quot;

==&quot;The Longest Game&quot;==

The PawSox played in and won the longest game in professional baseball history. The game against the Rochester Red Wings at McCoy Stadium started on April 18, 1981, and lasted 33 innings. Play was suspended at 4:07 a.m. at the end of the 32nd inning. The game did not resume again until June 23, when the Red Wings returned to Pawtucket. Only one inning was needed, with the PawSox winning 3–2 in the bottom of the 33rd when first baseman Dave Koza drove in the leadoff hitter, second baseman Marty Barrett, with a bases-loaded single off Cliff Speck. Neither Speck nor Steve Grilli, the Red Wings losing pitcher, were even on the team&#x27;s roster back in April. Future major league Hall of Fame players Cal Ripken Jr. and Wade Boggs played in the game.

On June 23, 2006, the PawSox celebrated the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Longest Game&quot; with events and festivities when they played the Columbus Clippers. The 35th anniversary was also commemorated on April 19, 2016.

==Perfect games==
* Tomo Ohka pitched a nine-inning perfect game for the Pawtucket Red Sox on June 1, 2000. Ohka retired all 27 batters he faced in a 2–0 win over the Charlotte Knights, and he needed just 76 pitches to toss the first nine-inning perfect game in the International League since 1952.
* On August 10, 2003, Bronson Arroyo pitched the fourth nine-inning perfect game in the 121-year history of the International League as the PawSox beat the Buffalo Bisons 7–0 at McCoy Stadium. He needed 101 pitches to throw his masterpiece (73 strikes), struck out nine, and got 10 fly outs and eight ground outs from the Buffalo 27 batters. He went to a three-ball count to just three hitters all game. At the end of the month, he was promoted to the majors, and remained with the Red Sox until the 2005–06 offseason, when the Red Sox traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for Wily Mo Pena.

==Hall of Famers==
Several PawSox players and personnel have been inducted into the International League Hall of Fame. They are owner Ben Mondor, manager Joe Morgan, outfielder Jim Rice, third baseman Wade Boggs, and then-team president Mike Tamburro, now their Vice Chairman. Several former PawSox players have also been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, including Carlton Fisk, Boggs and Rice.

In July 2016, Rice, Boggs, and Mondor (represented by his widow Madeleine) became the inaugural class of inductees into the PawSox Hall of Fame. Additions are considered on an annual basis.

==Titles==
The PawSox won the Governors&#x27; Cup, the championship of the IL, four times, and played in the championship series nine times. They also played in the championship of Triple-A baseball on three occasions: in 1973 they defeated the Tulsa Oilers 4 games to 1 in the Junior World Series, in 2012 they fell to the Reno Aces 10–3 in the Triple-A National Championship Game, and in 2014, the team was defeated by the Omaha Storm Chasers 4–2.

<doc id="558812" wikidata="Q2719301" url="?curid=558812" title="Extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis">
<text>The extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) proposes that some unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are best explained as being physical spacecraft occupied by extraterrestrial intelligence or non-human aliens, or non-occupied alien probes from other planets visiting Earth. In spite of ardent believers that various UFO sightings are verifiable evidence for the hypothesis, no rigorous analysis has ever concluded as much.

==Origins of the term==
Use of the term &quot;extraterrestrial hypothesis&quot; in printed material on UFOs seems to date to at least the latter half of the 1960s. French ufologist Jacques Vallée used it in his 1966 book &quot;Challenge to science: the UFO enigma&quot;. It was used in a publication by French engineer Aimé Michel in 1967, by James E. McDonald in a symposium in March 1968 and again by McDonald and James Harder while testifying before the Congressional Committee on Science and Astronautics, in July 1968. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book &quot;UFOs--Identified.&quot; In 1969 physicist Edward Condon defined the &quot;extraterrestrial hypothesis&quot; or &quot;ETH&quot; as the &quot;idea that &quot;some&quot; UFOs may be spacecraft sent to Earth from another civilization or space other than Earth, or on a planet associated with a more distant star,&quot; while presenting the findings of the much debated Condon Report. Some UFO historians credit Condon with popularizing the term and its abbreviation &quot;ETH.&quot;

==Chronology==
Although the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) as a phrase is a comparatively new concept, one which owes much to the flying saucer sightings of the 1940s–1960s, its origins can be traced back to a number of earlier events, such as the now-discredited Martian canals and ancient Martian civilization promoted by astronomer Percival Lowell, popular culture including the writings of H. G. Wells and fellow science fiction pioneers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, who likewise wrote of Martian civilizations, and even to the works of figures such as the Swedish philosopher, mystic and scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, who promoted a variety of unconventional views that linked other worlds to the afterlife.

In the early part of the twentieth century, Charles Fort collected accounts of anomalous physical phenomena from newspapers and scientific journals, including many reports of extraordinary aerial objects. These were published in 1919 in &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot;. In this and two subsequent books, &quot;New Lands&quot; (1923) and &quot;Lo!&quot; (1931), Fort theorized that visitors from other worlds were observing Earth. Fort&#x27;s reports of aerial phenomena were frequently cited in American newspapers when the UFO phenomenon first attracted widespread media attention in June and July 1947.

The modern ETH—specifically, the implicit linking of unidentified aircraft and lights in the sky to alien life—took root during the late 1940s and took its current form during the 1950s. It drew on pseudoscience, as well as popular culture. Unlike earlier speculation of extraterrestrial life, interest in the ETH was also bolstered by many unexplained sightings investigated by the U.S. government and governments of other countries, as well as private civilian groups, such as NICAP and APRO.

===Historical reports of extraterrestrial visits===
An early example of speculation over extraterrestrial visitors can be found in the French newspaper &quot;Le Pays&quot;, which on June 17, 1864, published a story about two American geologists who had allegedly discovered an alien-like creature, a mummified three-foot-tall hairless humanoid with a trunk-like appendage on its forehead, inside a hollow egg-shaped structure.

H. G. Wells, in his 1898 science fiction classic &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, popularized the idea of Martian visitation and invasion. Even before Wells, there was a sudden upsurge in reports in &quot;Mystery airships&quot; in the United States. For example, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; in 1897 speculated that the airships were &quot;a reconnoitering party from Mars&quot;, and the &quot;Saint Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; wrote: &quot;these may be visitors from Mars, fearful, at the last, of invading the planet they have been seeking.&quot; Later, there was a more international airship wave from 1909-1912. An example of an extraterrestrial explanation at the time was a 1909 letter to a New Zealand newspaper suggesting &quot;atomic powered spaceships from Mars.&quot;

From the 1920s, the idea of alien visitation in space ships was commonplace in popular comic strips and radio and movie serials, such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. In particular, the Flash Gordon serials have the Earth being attacked from space by alien meteors, ray beams, and biological weapons. In 1938, a radio broadcast version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by Orson Welles, using a contemporary setting for H. G. Wells&#x27; Martian invasion, created some public panic in the United States.

===The 1947 flying saucer wave in America===
On June 24, 1947, at about 3:00 p.m. local time, pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine unidentified disk-shaped aircraft flying near Mount Rainier. When no aircraft emerged that seemed to account for what he had seen, Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial. On July 7, 1947, two stories came out where Arnold was raising the topic of possible extraterrestrial origins, both as his opinion and those who had written to him. In an Associated Press story, Arnold said he had received quantities of fan mail eager to help solve the mystery. Some of them &quot;suggested the discs were visitations from another planet.&quot;

When the 1947 flying saucer wave hit the United States, there was much speculation in the newspapers about what they might be in news stories, columns, editorials, and letters to the editor. For example, on July 10, U.S. Senator Glen Taylor of Idaho commented, &quot;I almost wish the flying saucers would turn out to be space ships from another planet,&quot; because the possibility of hostility &quot;would unify the people of the earth as nothing else could.&quot; On July 8, R. DeWitt Miller was quoted by UP saying that the saucers had been seen since the early nineteenth century. If the present discs weren&#x27;t secret Army weapons, he suggested they could be vehicles from Mars, or other planets, or maybe even &quot;things out of other dimensions of time and space.&quot; Other articles brought up the work of Charles Fort, who earlier in the twentieth century had documented numerous reports of unidentified flying objects that had been written up in newspapers and scientific journals.

Even if people thought the saucers were real, most were generally unwilling to leap to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial in origin. Various popular theories began to quickly proliferate in press articles, such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria. According to journalist Edward R. Murrow, the ETH as a serious explanation for &quot;flying saucers&quot; did not earn widespread attention until about 18 months after Arnold&#x27;s sighting.

These attitudes seem to be reflected in the results of the first U.S. poll of public UFO perceptions released by Gallup on August 14, 1947. The term &quot;flying saucer&quot; was familiar to 90% of the respondents. As to what people thought explained them, the poll further showed, that most people either held no opinion or refused to answer the question (33%), or generally believed that there was a mundane explanation. 29% thought they were optical illusions, mirages, or imagination; 15% a U.S. secret weapon; 10% a hoax; 3% a &quot;weather forecasting device&quot;; 1% of Soviet origin, and 9% had &quot;other explanations,&quot; including fulfillment of Biblical prophecy, secret commercial aircraft, or phenomena related to atomic testing.

===U.S. military investigation and debunkery===
On July 9, Army Air Forces Intelligence began a secret study of the best saucer reports, including that of Arnold&#x27;s. A follow-up study by the Air Materiel Command intelligence and engineering departments at Wright Field, Ohio led to the formation of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Project Sign at the end of 1947, the first official U.S. military UFO study.

In 1948, Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation for all UFO reports, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg, citing a lack of physical evidence. Vandenberg dismantled Project Sign, and with this official policy in place, subsequent public Air Force reports concluded, that there was insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation of UFOs.

In 1952, Life Magazine published &quot;Have We Visitors From Space?&quot; which popularized the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis and is thought to have triggered the 1952 UFO flap. Immediately following the great UFO wave of 1952 and the military debunking of radar and visual sightings, plus jet interceptions over Washington, D.C. in August, the CIA&#x27;s Office of Scientific Investigation took particular interest in UFOs. Though the ETH was mentioned, it was generally given little credence. However, others within the CIA, such as the Psychological Strategy Board, were more concerned about how an unfriendly power such as the Soviet Union might use UFOs for psychological warfare purposes, exploit the gullibility of the public for the sensational, and clog intelligence channels. Under a directive from the National Security Council to review the problem, in January 1953, the CIA organized the Robertson Panel, a group of scientists who quickly reviewed the Blue Book&#x27;s best evidence, including motion pictures and an engineering report that concluded that the performance characteristics were beyond that of earthly craft. After two days&#x27; review, all cases were claimed to have conventional explanations. An official policy of public debunkery was recommended using the mass media and authority figures in order to influence public opinion and reduce the number of UFO reports.

===Evolution of public opinion===
The early 1950s also saw a number of movies depicting flying saucers and aliens, including &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot; (1956), and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956). A poll published in &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine in August 1951 reported that of the respondents who self-reported as UFO witnesses, 52% believed that they had seen a man-made aircraft, while only 4% believed that they had seen an alien craft; an additional 28% were uncertain, with more than half of these stating they believed they were either man-made aircraft, or &quot;visitors from afar.&quot; By 1957, 25% of Americans responded that they either believed, or were willing to believe in the ETH, while 53% responded that they were not. 22% reported that they were uncertain.

A Roper poll in 2002 reported that 56% of respondents thought UFOs were real, with 48% believing that UFOs had visited Earth.

===Religion===
===Fewer sightings despite camera phone technology===
As the proliferation of smartphone camera technology across the population has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, the claimed &quot;phenomenology&quot; of UFOs has been called into question. This goes counter to the predictions of supporters of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, even causing a crisis of confidence among some within the informal UFO research community.

===Involvement of scientists===
The scientific community has shown very little support for the ETH, and has largely accepted the explanation that reports of UFOs are the result of people misinterpreting common objects or phenomena, or are the work of hoaxers. Professor Stephen Hawking has expressed skepticism about the ETH. In a 1969 lecture, U.S. astrophysicist Carl Sagan said:

:&quot;The idea of benign or hostile space aliens from other planets visiting the Earth [is clearly] an emotional idea. There are two sorts of self-deception here: either accepting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation by space aliens in the face of very meager evidence because we want it to be true; or rejecting such an idea out of hand, in the absence of sufficient evidence, because we don&#x27;t want it to be true. Each of these extremes is a serious impediment to the study of UFOs.&quot;

Similarly, British astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock wrote

:&quot;for many years, discussions of the UFO issue have remained narrowly polarized between advocates and adversaries of a single theory, namely the extraterrestrial hypothesis ... this fixation on the ETH has narrowed and impoverished the debate, precluding an examination of other possible theories for the phenomenon.&quot;

An informal poll done by Sturrock in 1973 of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members found that about 10% of them believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space. In another poll conducted in 1977, Sturrock asked members of the American Astronomical Society to assign probabilities to eight possible explanations for UFOs. The results were:

The primary scientific arguments against ETH were summarized by astronomer and UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek during a presentation at the 1983 MUFON Symposium, where he outlined seven key reasons why he could not accept the ETH.

# Failure of sophisticated surveillance systems to detect incoming or outgoing UFOs
# Gravitational and atmospheric considerations
# Statistical considerations
# Elusive, evasive and absurd behavior of UFOs and their occupants
# Isolation of the UFO phenomenon in time and space: the Cheshire Cat effect
# The space unworthiness of UFOs
# The problem of astronomical distances

Hynek argued that:

# Despite worldwide radar systems and Earth-orbiting satellites, UFOs are alleged to flit in and out of the atmosphere, leaving little to no evidence.
# Space aliens are alleged to be overwhelmingly humanoid, and are allegedly able to exist on Earth without much difficulty often lacking &quot;space suits&quot;, even though extra-solar planets would likely have different atmospheres, biospheres, gravity and other factors, and extraterrestrial life would likely be very different from Earthly life.
# The number of reported UFOs and of purported encounters with UFO-inhabitants outstrips the number of expeditions that an alien civilization (or civilizations) could statistically be expected to mount.
# The behavior of extraterrestrials reported during alleged abductions is often inconsistent and irrational.
# UFOs are isolated in time and space: like the Cheshire Cat, they seem to appear and disappear at will, leaving only vague, ambiguous and mocking evidence of their presence
# Reported UFOs are often far too small to support a crew traveling through space, and their reported flight behavior is often not representative of a craft under intelligent control (erratic flight patterns, sudden course changes).
# The distance between planets makes interstellar travel impractical, particularly because of the amount of energy that would be required for interstellar travel using conventional means, (According to a NASA estimate, it would take 7 joules of energy to send the then-current Space Shuttle on a one-way 50-year journey to the nearest star, an enormous amount of energy) and because of the level of technology that would be required to &quot;circumvent&quot; conventional energy/fuel/speed limitations using exotic means, such as Einstein-Rosen Bridges as ways to shorten distances from point A to point B. (&quot;see Faster-than-light travel&quot;).

According to the personal assessment of Hynek at the time, points 1 through 6 could be argued, but point 7 represented an &quot;insurmountable&quot; barrier to the validity of the ETH.

==NASA==
NASA frequently fields questions in regard to the ETH and UFOs. As of 2006, its official standpoint was that ETH has a lack of empirical evidence.

:&quot;no one has ever found a single artifact, or any other convincing evidence for such alien visits&quot;. David Morrison.
:&quot;As far as I know, no claims of UFOs as being alien craft have any validity -- the claims are without substance, and certainly not proved&quot;. David Morrison

Despite public interest, up until 2021, NASA had considered the study of ETH to be irrelevant to its work because of the number of false leads that a study would provide, and the limited amount of usable scientific data that it would yield. On the History Channel UFO Hunters episode &quot;The NASA Files&quot; (2008), Former NASA astronauts have commented; Gordon Cooper wrote that NASA and the government &quot;swept these and other sightings under the rug&quot;. Brian O&#x27;Leary stated &quot;some of my fellow astronauts and scientists astronauts that did go up and who have observed things, very clearly, they were told - not to report it&quot;.

In June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced that he had directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. During an interview at the University of Virginia, Bill Nelson explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology.

NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP. 

In August 2021, at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Aviation, Kopparapu presented a paper from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 134th Meeting General Symposium that supported ETH. Kopparapu stated he and his colleagues found the paper &quot;perfectly credible&quot;.

==Conspiracy theories==
A frequent concept in ufology and popular culture is that the true extent of information about UFOs is being suppressed by some form of conspiracy of silence, or by an official cover-up that is acting to conceal information.

In 1968, American engineer James Harder argued that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs &quot;beyond reasonable doubt,&quot; but that the evidence had been suppressed and largely neglected by scientists and the general public, thus preventing sound conclusions from being reached on the ETH.

:&quot;Over the past 20 years a vast amount of evidence has been accumulating that bears on the existence of UFOs. Most of this is little known to the general public or to most scientists. But on the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; J A Harder

A survey carried out by Industrial Research magazine in 1971 showed that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs (76%) than believed in the existence of UFOs (54%), or in ETH itself (32%).

People have had a long-standing curiosity about extraterrestrial life. Aliens are the subject of numerous urban legends, including claims that they have long been present on earth or that they may be able to assist humans in resolving certain issues. Despite these myths, the truth is that there is no scientific proof to back up these assertions, hence we cannot declare with certainty whether or not aliens exist.

===Documents and investigations regarding ETH===
Other private or government studies, some secret, have concluded in favor of the ET hypothesis, or have had members who disagreed in contravention with official conclusions reached by the committees and agencies to which they belonged. The following are examples of sources that have focused specifically on the topic:
* In 1967, Greek physicist Paul Santorini, a Manhattan Project scientist, publicly stated that a 1947 Greek government investigation into the European Ghost rockets of 1946 under his lead quickly concluded that they were not missiles. Santorini claimed the investigation was then quashed by military officials from the U.S., who knew them to be extraterrestrial, because there was no defense against the advanced technology and they feared widespread panic should the results become public.
* A 1948 Top Secret USAF Europe document (at right) states that Swedish air intelligence informed them that at least some of their investigators into the ghost rockets and flying saucers concluded they had extraterrestrial origins: &quot;...Flying saucers have been reported by so many sources and from such a variety of places that we are convinced that they cannot be disregarded and must be explained on some basis which is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of our present intelligence thinking. When officers of this Directorate recently visited the Swedish Air Intelligence Service... their answer was that some reliable and fully technically qualified people have reached the conclusion that &#x27;these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on earth.&#x27; They are therefore assuming that these objects originate from some previously unknown or unidentified technology, possibly outside the earth.&quot;
* In 1948, the USAF Project Sign produced a Top Secret Estimate of the Situation, concluding that the ETH was the most likely explanation for the most perplexing unexplained cases. The study was ordered destroyed by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg, citing lack of proof. Knowledge of the existence of the Estimate has come from insiders who said they read a surviving copy, including the later USAF Project Blue Book head Edward J. Ruppelt, and astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek.
* West Germany, in conjunction with other European countries, conducted a secret study from 1951 to 1954, also concluding that UFOs were extraterrestrial. This study was revealed by German rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth, who headed the study and who also made many public statements supporting the ETH in succeeding years. At the study&#x27;s conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared: &quot;These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy.&quot; Soon afterwards, in an October 24, 1954, article in &quot;The American Weekly&quot;, Oberth wrote: &quot;It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system. I think that they possibly are manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries...&quot;
* The CIA started their own internal scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added: &quot;...as long as a series of reports remains &#x27;unexplainable&#x27; (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject.&quot; A report from later that month was similarly skeptical, but nevertheless concluded: &quot;...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, at a time when the background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even &#x27;blue yonder&#x27; explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers.&quot; A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: &quot;...the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation [&quot;sic&quot;] are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.&quot; Some of the memos also made it clear, that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335)
* The CIA organized the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force&#x27;s Project Blue Book. This included an engineering analysis of UFO maneuvers by Blue Book (including a motion picture film analysis by Naval scientists) that had concluded UFOs were under intelligent control and likely extraterrestrial.
* Extraterrestrial &quot;believers&quot; within Project Blue Book included Major Dewey Fournet, in charge of the engineering analysis of UFO motion, who later became a board member on the civilian UFO organization NICAP. Blue Book director Edward J. Ruppelt privately commented on other firm &quot;pro-UFO&quot; members in the USAF investigations, including some Pentagon generals, such as Charles P. Cabell, USAF Chief of Air Intelligence, who, angry at the inaction and debunkery of Project Grudge, dissolved it in 1951, established Project Blue Book in its place, and made Ruppelt director. In 1953, Cabell became deputy director of the CIA. Another defector from the official Air Force party line was consultant J. Allen Hynek, who started out as a staunch skeptic. After 20 years of investigation, he changed positions and generally supported the ETH. He became the most publicly known UFO advocate scientist in the 1970s and 1980s.
* The first CIA Director, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, stated in a signed statement to Congress, also reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (February 28, 1960): &quot;It is time for the truth to be brought out... Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. However, through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense... I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects.&quot; In 1962, in his letter of resignation from NICAP, he told director Donald Keyhoe, &quot;I know the UFOs are not U.S. or Soviet devices. All we can do now is wait for some actions by the UFOs.&quot;
* Although the 1968 Condon Report came to a negative conclusion (written by Condon), it is known that many members of the study strongly disagreed with Condon&#x27;s methods and biases. Most quit the project in disgust, or were fired for insubordination. A few became ETH supporters. Perhaps the best known example is David Saunders, who in his 1968 book &quot;UFOs? Yes&quot; lambasted Condon for extreme bias, and for ignoring or misrepresenting critical evidence. Saunders wrote: &quot;It is clear... that the sightings have been going on for too long to explain in terms of straightforward terrestrial intelligence. It&#x27;s in this sense that ETI (Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) stands as the &#x27;least implausible&#x27; explanation of &#x27;real UFOs&#x27;.&quot;
* In 1999, the private French COMETA report (written primarily by military defense analysts) stated the conclusion regarding UFO phenomena, that a &quot;single hypothesis sufficiently takes into account the facts and, for the most part, only calls for present-day science. It is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors.&quot; The report noted issues with formulating the extraterrestrial hypothesis, likening its study to the study of meteorites, but concluded, that although it was far from the best scientific hypothesis, &quot;strong presumptions exist in its favour&quot;. The report also concludes, that the studies it presents, &quot;demonstrate the almost certain physical reality of completely unknown flying objects with remarkable flight performances and noiselessness, apparently operated by intelligent [beings] ... Secret craft definitely of earthly origins (drones, stealth aircraft, etc.) can only explain a minority of cases. If we go back far enough in time, we clearly perceive the limits of this explanation.&quot;
* Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, wrote a book in 2005, saying, that 14% of the 5800 cases studied by SEPRA were &#x27;utterly inexplicable and extraterrestrial&#x27; in origin. However, the CNES own report says 28% of sightings remain unidentified. Yves Sillard, the head of the new official French UFO investigation GEIPAN and former head of French space agency CNES, echoes Velasco&#x27;s comments and adds, that the United States &#x27;is guilty of covering up this information.&#x27; However, this is not the official public posture of SEPRA, CNES, or the French government. (The CNES placed their 5,800 case files on the Internet starting March 2007.)

==Official White House position==
In November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, &quot;The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&quot; Also, according to the response, there is &quot;no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public&#x27;s eye.&quot; The response further noted that efforts, like SETI, the Kepler space telescope and the NASA Mars rover, continue looking for signs of life. The response noted &quot;the odds are pretty high&quot; that there may be life on other planets but &quot;the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved.&quot;

<doc id="558822" wikidata="Q5478100" url="?curid=558822" title="Fran Bailey">
<text>Frances Esther Bailey (born 21 May 1946) is a former Australian politician. She is a member of the Liberal Party and served in the House of Representatives from 1990 to 1993 and 1996 to 2010, representing the Division of McEwen in Victoria. She held ministerial office in the Howard government as Minister for Employment Services (2004) and Small Business and Tourism (2004–2007).

==Early life==
Bailey was born in Brisbane and attended All Hallows&#x27; School there, where she was regarded as a champion swimmer. She graduated from the University of Queensland and Kelvin Grove Teachers&#x27; College, later studying sociology at La Trobe University.

Bailey worked as a secondary school teacher, retailer and cashmere goat breeder before entering politics.

==Politics==
Bailey was secretary of the Yarra Glen branch of the Liberal Party from 1984 to 1988 and President of the branch from 1988 to 1989. She also worked as the campaign director for the Victorian state seat of Evelyn at the 1988 election.

Bailey was first elected at the 1990 election, defeating Labor incumbent Peter Cleeland in McEwen. She became the first female Liberal candidate elected to a Victorian seat, and the first woman elected to represent a rural electorate.

She was promoted to Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs, and was heavily involved with the Liberals&#x27; Fightback! campaign to regain power. Cleeland defeated her in the 1993 election, a rematch of 1990. However, she won the seat back in 1996, defeating Cleeland in another rematch. She served on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade from 1998 to 2002.

Before her return to McEwen, she sought preselection for the 1994 Kooyong by-election but the preselection and then the by-election was won by her future parliamentary colleague Petro Georgiou.

===Ministerial career===
In 2001, Bailey was promoted to Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. In July 2004 she was promoted to Minister for Employment Services and Assistant Minister for Defence. She became Minister for Small Business and Tourism in October 2004.

===Tourism Minister and clash with Scott Morrison===
During her stint as tourism minister, Bailey clashed with the future prime minister, Scott Morrison, who was the managing director of Tourism Australia (TA).

It was described that Morrison was trying to &quot;steal the limelight&quot; from Bailey and did press releases without approval of Bailey who was his boss and bypassed her office on key decisions. Morrison and the TA board pushed for the &quot;So where the bloody hell are you?&quot; ad campaign to be awarded to M&amp;C Saatchi, reportedly bypassing Bailey and government procurement guidelines for three contracts with a total value of $184 million.

In 2006, she flew to London with Lara Bingle to successfully lobby the British Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC) for the right to use the word &quot;bloody&quot; in advertisements promoting Australia for the &quot;So where the bloody hell are you?&quot; campaign, as the word &quot;bloody&quot; breached the BACC&#x27;s guidelines. However, privately Bailey believed that Morrison and his team had failed to do the proper research into Britain&#x27;s advertising code before rolling out the ad campaign in Britain. Morrison also repeatedly kept critical information from the Tourism Australia board. As the minister and the TA board lost confidence in Morrison, Bailey advised to Prime Minister John Howard that Morrison be sacked. Howard accepted the advice and Morrison was fired in August 2006.

More than a year later in 2007 Morrison was elected to Federal Parliament as the Liberal member for Cook and this meant that he and Bailey were in the same party room for what would become her final term in Parliament.

In 2022, following Morrison&#x27;s multi-ministerial positions controversy, Bailey revealed that Morrison showed no respect for his colleagues at Tourism Australia and he left her feeling bullied, also confirming that he &quot;point-blank refused&quot; to provide her or the board with any documentation or to answer questions about how the ad campaign was awarded to Saatchi. She said she was &quot;gobsmacked when he became prime minister&quot; and called for Morrison to resign from Parliament. She described that Morrison had &quot;the supreme belief that only he can do a job, the lack of consultation with those closest to him – those characteristics were evident 16 years ago, and perhaps we’re seeing the end result of those now&quot;.

===2007 election controversy and final term===
Her period as minister ended with the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 election. Her hold on McEwen was always somewhat tenuous due to its demographics. Although classed as rural by the Australian Electoral Commission, it is actually a hybrid urban-rural seat. It includes several outer northern suburbs of Melbourne that tilt heavily to Labor, while the more rural portion votes equally heavily for the Liberals and Nationals. However, the 2007 election resulted in McEwen becoming the most marginal seat in the country. Initially, it appeared that Bailey had lost to former Labor state MP Rob Mitchell by six votes. Bailey requested and was granted a full recount, which gave her the win by 12 votes.

The result was challenged in the High Court of Australia in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns, and was referred to the Federal Court of Australia. Over seven months after the election and a review of 643 individual votes, the court altered the formal status of several dozen, eventually declaring Bailey the winner by 27 votes. Following the resolution of the long-running dispute, Bailey called for a total overhaul of the voting system.

Bailey announced in October 2009 that she would retire at the 2010 election.

<doc id="558824" wikidata="Q5325474" url="?curid=558824" title="Ealing comedies">
<text>The Ealing comedies is an informal name for a series of comedy films produced by the London-based Ealing Studios during a ten-year period from 1947 to 1957. Often considered to reflect Britain&#x27;s post-war spirit, the most celebrated films in the sequence include &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949), &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (1949), &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951), &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; (1947) is generally considered to be the earliest of the cycle, and &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1957) the last, although some sources list &quot;Davy&quot; (1958) as the final Ealing comedy. Many of the Ealing comedies are ranked among the greatest British films, and they also received international acclaim.

==History==

Relatively few comedy films were made at Ealing Studios until several years after World War II. The 1939 film &quot;Cheer Boys Cheer&quot;, featuring the rivalry between two brewing companies, one big and modernist, the other small and traditional, has been characterised as a prototype of later films. One of the few other films that can be seen as a direct precursor to the Ealing comedies is &quot;Saloon Bar&quot; (1940), in which the regulars of a public house join forces to clear the name of the barmaid&#x27;s boyfriend who has been accused of murder. Other wartime comedies featuring actors such as Tommy Trinder, Will Hay and George Formby were generally in a broader music hall tradition and had little in common with the later Ealing comedy films. Ealing made no comedy films at all in 1945 and 1946.

===Comedies===
T. E. B. Clarke wrote the screenplay for &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; (1947), about a group of schoolboys who confront a criminal gang, which proved to be a critical and commercial success. It was followed by three films with Celtic themes: &quot;Another Shore&quot; (1948), about the fantasies of a bored Dublin customs official, &quot;A Run for Your Money&quot; (1949), depicting the adventures of two inexperienced Welshmen in London for an important rugby international, and &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, (1949) about Scottish islanders during the Second World War who discover that a freighter with a large cargo of whisky has run aground.

&quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949) is a dark comedy in which the son of an impoverished branch of the aristocratic D&#x27;Ascoyne family murders eight other members, all of whom are played by Alec Guinness, in order to inherit the family dukedom and gain revenge on his snobbish relations. In &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), a newly uncovered mediaeval charter causes the inhabitants of the London neighbourhood of Pimlico to create their own independent nation state and end rationing, leading to a variety of unexpected problems and diplomatic incidents with the British government.

&quot;The Magnet&quot; (1950), set in Liverpool, is about a boy whose acquisition of a magnet leads to a series of adventures in the city. In &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951) a timid bank clerk gets together an unlikely gang of accomplices to snatch a delivery of gold bullion. The armed robbery proves surprisingly successful, but things start to go wrong when they attempt to melt down their haul into model Eiffel Towers. &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951) features the efforts of a zealous young scientist to create a new kind of clothing material that will never get dirty and never wear out – an invention that threatens the livelihoods of both big business and the trade unions who join forces to try to prevent the publication of this new discovery.

&quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953) echoes the theme of &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, switched to a rural setting, with a small community standing up for their local interests when their branch line is threatened with closure by British Railways in a forerunner of the Beeching cuts a decade later. The villagers join forces to keep their railway running, but face competition and sabotage from a rival bus company. 

&quot;Meet Mr. Lucifer&quot; (1953) follows a television set as it is passed on from one owner to another, causing dissatisfaction wherever it goes. The film serves as a warning about the effects of rapidly expanding television use.

&quot;The Love Lottery&quot; (1954) sees a matinee idol Hollywood star, played by David Niven, agree to take part in a &quot;love lottery&quot;. &quot;The Maggie&quot; (1954) features a clash of culture and wills between a wily Scottish boat captain and a vigorous American business tycoon who has mistakenly contracted the boat to carry a cargo for him. In &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955) a gang of criminals rent a room from the elderly Mrs Wilberforce while they&#x27;re pretending to be a string quintet looking for a space to practice. They plan to use the house to stage a robbery at nearby King&#x27;s Cross railway station. On the brink of escape, they are thwarted by Mrs Wilberforce who discovers their true purpose. The gang agree that she has to be murdered before she can go to the police, but prove incapable of doing this, and begin turning on each other instead.

===Later comedies===
&quot;Who Done It?&quot; (1956) was the final comedy made at Ealing Studios, before it was sold to the BBC. It parodies detective fiction with a young man setting himself up in business as a private detective after receiving a windfall of £100. His confused efforts to solve a crime lead to his becoming entangled in Cold War espionage. The film was closer in style to traditional 1930s comedy, rather than the type of films Ealing had become known for over the previous decade.

Two final comedies were released under the Ealing banner, but made at Elstree Studios. &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1957) follows Captain Ambrose who, after leaving the navy, buys a run-down pier on the English seaside. Ambrose tries to revive the pier crossing swords with the local council who have a scheme to redevelop the entire seafront, personally enriching themselves while ruining him. Ambrose battles them by severing his connection with the shore, registering his pier as a ship under a foreign flag, and marketing it as a tourist destination for those too seasick to go on cruises. In &quot;Davy&quot; (1958) a promising entertainer tries to decide whether to strike out on his own, or stay with his family&#x27;s struggling music hall act. No further comedies were made by Ealing, and after the thriller &quot;Siege of Pinchgut&quot; (1959), the brand was absorbed into the wider Rank Organisation.
The previous year Rank had released &quot;Rockets Galore!&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, but its production was unconnected with Ealing.

===Personnel===

Many of the films were built around a repertory group of actors, screenwriters, directors and technicians. Directors were Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer, Charles Frend, Michael Relph and Henry Cornelius. Composers included Ernest Irving and Georges Auric. Notable actors who became prolific in these films included Stanley Holloway, Alec Guinness, Joan Greenwood, Cecil Parker, Moira Lister and Peggy Cummins. A number of actors also appeared frequently in smaller roles such as Edie Martin and Philip Stainton. 
In what was his first major film role, Peter Sellers starred opposite Alec Guinness in &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;. In &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; Guinness had played multiple roles (which Sellers would later emulate). Sellers stated that during filming he &quot;used to watch Alec Guinness do everything, his rehearsals, his scenes, everything. He is my ideal... and my idol.&quot;

==Legacy==

Though Ealing Studios has come to be remembered for its comedies, they were only a tenth of its productions. Conversely, Gainsborough Pictures is associated with the Gainsborough melodramas though it also produced many comedies. 

Many of the Ealing comedies are ranked among the greatest British films, with &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; ranked number 6, &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; ranked number 13 and &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; ranked number 17 (all three featuring Alec Guinness) in the BFI Top 100 British films. These films were also an international success and received acclaim in the US. In 2005, &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s list of the top 100 films since 1923. &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; won the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, the BAFTA Award for Best British Film, and Guinness was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (his first Oscar nomination). Former North Korea leader Kim Jong Il was also said to have been a fan of Ealing comedies, inspired by their emphasis on team spirit and a mobilised proletariat. 

&quot;The Ealing Comedies&quot;, a documentary examining the films and featuring interviews with many key players, was screened as part of BBC1&#x27;s Tuesday Documentary strand in April 1971.

Ealing comedies were adapted for radio and broadcast over BBC Radio 4, including &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; in 1990 starring Robert Powell and Timothy Bateson and in 2007 starring Michael Kitchen and Harry Enfield.

<doc id="558825" wikidata="Q899359" url="?curid=558825" title="Barbary corsairs">
<text>The Barbary corsairs, Barbary pirates, Ottoman corsairs, or naval mujahideen (in Muslim sources) were mainly Muslim corsairs and privateers who operated from the largely independent Barbary states. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary Coast, in reference to the Berbers. Slaves in Barbary could be of many ethnicities, and of many different religions, such as Christian, Jewish, or Muslim. Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along West Africa&#x27;s Atlantic seaboard and into the North Atlantic as far north as Iceland, but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing merchant ships, they engaged in &quot;razzias&quot;, raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in the British Isles, and Iceland.

While such raids began after the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the 710s, the terms &quot;Barbary pirates&quot; and &quot;Barbary corsairs&quot; are normally applied to the raiders active from the 16th century onwards, when the frequency and range of the slavers&#x27; attacks increased. In that period, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the Barbary states. Similar raids were undertaken from Salé (see Salé Rovers) and other ports in Morocco.

Barbary corsairs captured thousands of merchant ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns in Europe. As a result, residents abandoned their former villages on long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy.

The raids were such a problem that coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th century. Between 1580 and 1680, corsairs were said to have captured about 850,000 people as slaves and from 1530 to 1780 as many as 1.25 million people were enslaved. However, these numbers are estimated and provided by only one historian, Robert Davis, and have been questioned by others like David Earle. Some of these corsairs were European outcasts and converts (renegade) such as John Ward and Zymen Danseker. Hayreddin Barbarossa and Oruç Reis, the Turkish Barbarossa brothers, who took control of Algiers on behalf of the Ottomans in the early 16th century, were also notorious corsairs. The European pirates brought advanced sailing and shipbuilding techniques to the Barbary Coast around 1600, which enabled the corsairs to extend their activities into the Atlantic Ocean. The effects of the Barbary raids peaked in the early-to-mid-17th century.

Long after Europeans had abandoned oar-driven vessels in favor of sailing ships carrying tons of powerful cannon, many Barbary warships were galleys carrying a hundred or more fighting men armed with cutlasses and small arms. The Barbary navies were not battle fleets. When they sighted a European frigate, they fled.

The scope of corsair activity began to diminish in the latter part of the 17th century, as the more powerful European navies started to compel the Barbary states to make peace and cease attacking their shipping. However, the ships and coasts of Christian states without such effective protection continued to suffer until the early 19th century. Between 1801 and 1815, occasional incidents occurred, including two Barbary Wars waged by the United States, Sweden and the Kingdom of Sicily against the Barbary states. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15, European powers agreed upon the need to suppress the Barbary corsairs entirely. The remainder of the threat was finally subdued for Europeans by the French conquest of Algeria in 1830 and so-called &quot;pacification&quot; by the French during the mid-to-late 19th century.

==History==
The Barbary corsairs were active from medieval times to the 1800s.

===Muslim Historical Narratives===
Both Europeans (e.g., the Dum Diversas) and Muslims considered themselves to be waging holy wars against each other during this era. European and American historical sources bluntly consider these operations to be a form of piracy and that their goal was mainly to seize ships to obtain spoils, money, and slaves. Muslim sources, however, sometimes refer to the &quot;Islamic naval jihad&quot;—casting the conflicts as part of a sacred mission of war under Allah, differing from the more familiar form of jihad only in being waged at sea. Accounts of Andalusian Muslims being persecuted by the notoriously ruthless Spanish Inquisition—willingly abetted by the so-called &quot;Catholic Monarchs&quot;, who (though inaugurating what would later become Spain&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;) were initially faced with the post-Reconquista necessity of binding their (hitherto-divided) territories together, and hence adopted a militantly Christian national identity—provided more than enough justification, in Muslim eyes. 

===The Middle Ages===
In 1198, the problem of Barbary piracy and slave-taking was so significant that the Trinitarians, a religious order, was founded to collect ransoms and even to exchange themselves as a ransom for those captured and pressed into slavery in North Africa. In the 14th century, Tunisian corsairs became enough of a threat to provoke a Franco-Genoese attack on Mahdia in 1390 (also known as the &quot;Barbary Crusade&quot;). Moorish exiles of the Reconquista and Maghreb pirates added to the numbers, but it was not until the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the arrival of the privateer and admiral Kemal Reis in 1487 that the Barbary corsairs became a true menace to shipping from European Christian nations.

===16th century===
From 1559, the North African cities of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, were autonomous military republics that chose their rulers and lived by war booty captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. There are several cases of Sephardic Jews, including Sinan Reis and Samuel Pallache, who upon fleeing Iberia attacked the Spanish Empire&#x27;s shipping under the Ottoman flag.

During the first period (1518–1587), the beylerbeys were admirals of the sultan, commanding great fleets and conducting war operations for political ends. They were slave hunters, and their methods were ferocious. After 1587, the sole object of their successors was plundering, both on land and sea. The maritime operations were conducted by the captains, or &quot;reises&quot;, who formed a class or even a corporation. Cruisers were fitted out by investors and commanded by the &quot;reises&quot;. 10% of the value of the prizes was paid to the pasha or his successors, who bore the titles of &quot;agha&quot; or &quot;dey&quot; or &quot;bey&quot;.
In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 2,000–7,000 inhabitants of Lipari. In 1551, Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to Ottoman Tripolitania. In 1554, corsairs under Turgut Reis sacked Vieste, beheaded 5,000 of its inhabitants, and abducted another 6,000.

===17th century===

In the early years of the 17th century, the Barbary states attracted English pirates, many of whom had previously operated as privateers under Queen Elizabeth I. Still, they found themselves unwanted by her successor King James VI and I. Whereas in England, these pirates were reviled, in the Barbary states, they were respected and had access to safe markets to resupply and repair their ships. Many of these pirates converted to Islam.

A notable Christian action against the Barbary states occurred in 1607, when the Knights of Saint Stephen (under Jacopo Inghirami) sacked Bona in Algeria, killing 470 and taking 1,464 captives. This victory is commemorated by a series of frescoes painted by Bernardino Poccetti in the &quot;Sala di Bona&quot; of Palazzo Pitti, Florence. In 1611, Spanish galleys from Naples, accompanied by the galleys of the Knights of Malta, raided the Kerkennah Islands off the coast of Tunisia and took away almost 500 Muslim captives. Between 1568 and 1634, the Knights of Saint Stephen may have captured about 14,000 Muslims, with perhaps one-third taken in land raids and two-thirds taken on captured ships.

Ireland was attacked similarly. In June 1631, Murat Reis, with corsairs from Algiers and armed troops of the Ottoman Empire, stormed ashore at the little harbor village of Baltimore, County Cork. They captured almost all the villagers and took them away to a life of slavery in North Africa. The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates—some lived out their days chained to the oars as galley slaves. At the same time, women spent long years as concubines in harems or within the walls of the sultan&#x27;s palace. Only two of these captives ever returned to Ireland. England was also subject to pirate raids; in 1640, 60 men, women and children were enslaved by Algerian corsairs who raided Penzance.

More than 20,000 captives were said to be imprisoned in Algiers alone. The rich were often able to secure release through ransom, but the poor were condemned to slavery. Their masters would, on occasion, allow them to secure freedom by professing Islam. A long list might be given of people of good social position, not only Italians or Spaniards but German or English travelers in the south, who were captives for a time.

In 1675, a Royal Navy squadron led by Sir John Narborough negotiated a lasting peace with Tunis and, after bombarding the city to induce compliance, with Tripoli.

=== 18th–19th centuries===

Piracy was enough of a problem for some states to enter the redemption business. In Denmark: 


Until the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, British treaties with the North African states protected American ships from the Barbary corsairs. During the American Revolutionary War, the Corsairs attacked American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. However, on December 20, 1777, Sultan Mohammed III of Morocco issued a declaration recognizing America as an independent country, and stating that American merchant ships could enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The relations were formalized with the Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship signed in 1786, which stands as the U.S.&#x27;s oldest non-broken friendship treaty with a foreign power.

The Barbary threat led directly to the United States founding the United States Navy in March 1794. While the United States did secure peace treaties with the Barbary states, it was obliged to pay tribute for protection from attack. The burden was substantial: from 1795, the annual tribute paid to the Regency of Algiers amounted to 20% of United States federal government&#x27;s annual expenditures.

In 1798, an islet near Sardinia was attacked by the Tunisians, and more than 900 inhabitants were taken away as slaves.
The Barbary states had difficulty securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding, as this had been traditionally of central importance to the North African economy. Slavers continued to take captives by preying on less well-protected peoples. Algiers subsequently renewed its slave-raiding, though on a smaller scale. Europeans at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 discussed possible retaliation. In 1824, a British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Burrard Neale bombarded Algiers. Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until France conquered the state in 1830.

==Barbary slave trade==

From bases on the Barbary Coast, North Africa, the Barbary corsairs raided ships travelling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the corsairs also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, England and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore, Ireland were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary corsairs.

===Slave quarters===
At night the slaves were put into prisons called &#x27;bagnios&#x27; (derived from the Italian word &quot;bagno&quot; for &quot;public bath&quot;, inspired by the Turks&#x27; use of Roman baths at Constantinople as prisons), which were often hot and overcrowded. Bagnios had chapels, hospitals, shops and bars run by captives.

===Galley slaves===
Although the conditions in bagnios were harsh, they were better than those endured by galley slaves. Most Barbary galleys were at sea for around eighty to a hundred days a year, but when the slaves assigned to them were on land, they were forced to do hard manual labor. There were exceptions:

During this time, rowers were shackled and chained where they sat, and never allowed to leave. Sleeping (which was limited), eating, defecation and urination took place at the seat to which they were shackled. There were usually five or six rowers on each oar. Overseers would walk back and forth and whip slaves considered not to be working hard enough.

===Number of people enslaved===
The number of slaves captured by Barbary corsairs are difficult to quantify. According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary corsairs and sold as slaves in North Africa and Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary corsairs were constant for a 250-year period, stating:


Historians welcomed Davis&#x27;s attempt to quantify the number of European slaves, but were divided as to the accuracy of the unorthodox methodology which he relied on in the absence of written records. The historian David Earle, author of &quot;The Corsairs of Malta&quot; and &quot;Barbary and The Pirate Wars&quot;, questioned Davis, saying &quot;His figures sound a bit dodgy and I think he may be exaggerating.&quot; He cautioned that the true picture of European slaves is clouded by the fact that the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa. He wouldn&#x27;t &quot;hazard a guess about their total&quot;. Professor Ian Blanchard, an expert on African trade and economic history at the University of Edinburgh, said that Davis&#x27;s work was solid and that a number over a million was in line with his expectations.

Davis notes that his calculations were based on observers reports of approximately 35,000 European Christian slaves on the Barbary Coast at any one time during the late 1500s and early 1600s, held in Tripoli, Tunis and, mostly, Algiers.

===Legacy===
The history of Muslim enslavement of white Europeans has been cited by some as contextualising the importance of subsequent European and American enslavement of blacks. Scholar Robert Davis noted that the larger picture isn&#x27;t so one-sided: during a &quot;clash of empires... taking slaves was part of the conflict,&quot; and at the same time 2 million Europeans were enslaved by Muslims in North Africa and the Near East, 1 million Muslim slaves in Europe.

As Dr. John Callow at University of Suffolk notes, the experience of enslavement by the Barbary corsairs preceded the Atlantic slave trade and &quot;the memory of slavery, and the methodology of slaving, that was burned into the British consciousness was first and foremost rooted in a North African context, where Britons were more likely to be slaves than slave masters.&quot;

==Barbary corsairs==
According to historian, Adrian Tinniswood, the most notorious corsairs were European renegades who had learned their trade as privateers, and who moved to the Barbary Coast during peacetime to pursue their trade. These outcasts, who had converted to Islam, brought up-to-date naval expertise to the piracy business, and enabled the corsairs to make long-distance slave-catching raids as far away as Iceland and Newfoundland. Infamous corsair Henry Mainwaring, who was initially a lawyer and pirate-hunter, later returned home to a royal pardon. Mainwaring later wrote a book about the practise of piracy in the Mediterranean, aptly titled the &quot;Discourse of Pirates&quot;. In the book, Mainwaring outlined potential methods to hunt down and eliminate piracy.

===Barbarossa brothers===

====Oruç Barbarossa====
The most famous of the corsairs in North Africa were the Barbarossa brothers, Aruj and Khayr al-Din. They, and two less well-known brothers all became Barbary corsairs in the service of the Ottoman Empire who later became &quot;Kings&quot; when they established a new state in the Maghreb known as the Ottoman Regency of Algiers. They were called the Barbarossas (Italian for Redbeards) after the red beard of Oruç, the eldest. Oruç captured the island of Djerba for the Hafsids in 1502 or 1503. He often attacked Spanish coasts and their territories on the coast of North Africa; during one failed attempt in Béjaia in 1512 he lost his left arm to a cannonball. The eldest Barbarossa also went to capture Algiers in 1516. Well aided by his Berber allies from the Kingdom of Kuku, he vanquished a Spanish expedition intended to replace the Spanish vassal ruler of Algiers that he executed with his son along with everybody he suspected would oppose him in favor of his Spanish foes, including local Zayyanid rulers. He was finally captured and killed by the Spanish in Tlemcen in 1518, and put on display.

====Hızır Hayreddin Barbarossa====

Oruç, based mainly on land, was not the best-known of the Barbarossas. His youngest brother Hızır (later called Hayreddin or Kheir ed-Din) was a more traditional corsair. After capturing many crucial coastal areas, Hayreddin was appointed admiral-in-chief of the Ottoman sultan&#x27;s fleet. Under his command the Ottoman Empire was able to gain and keep control of the Mediterranean for over thirty years. Barbaros Hızır Hayreddin Pasha died in 1546 of a fever, possibly the plague.

===Captain Jack Ward===

English corsair Jack, or John, Ward was once called &quot;beyond doubt the greatest scoundrel that ever sailed from England&quot; by the English ambassador to Venice. Ward was a privateer for Queen Elizabeth during her war with Spain; after the end of the war, he became a corsair. With some associates he captured a ship in about 1603 and sailed it to Tunis; he and his crew converted to Islam. He was successful and became rich. He introduced heavily armed square-rigged ships, used instead of galleys, to the North African area, a major reason for the Barbary&#x27;s future dominance of the Mediterranean. He died of plague in 1622.

=== Sayyida al-Hurra ===

Sayyida al-Hurra was a female Muslim cleric, merchant, governor of Tétouan, and later the wife of the sultan of Morocco. She was born around 1485 in the Emirate of Granada, but was forced to flee to Morocco when she was very young to escape the Reconquista. In Morocco, she gathered a crew largely of exiled Moors, and launched pirate expeditions against Spain and Portugal to avenge the Reconquista, protect Morocco from Christian pirates, and seek riches and glory. Sayyida al-Hurra became wealthy and renowned enough for the Sultan of Morocco, Ahmad al-Wattasi to make her his queen. Notably, however, she refused to marry in his capital of Fez, and would not get married but in Tétouan, of which she was governor. This was the first and only time in history that a Moroccan monarch married away from their capital.

=== Raïs Hamidou ===

Hamidou ben Ali, known as Raïs Hamidou (), or Amidon in American literature, born around 1770, and died on June 17, 1815, near Cape Gata off the coast of southern Spain, was an Algerian corsair. He captured up to 200 ships during his career. Hamidou ensured the prosperity of the Deylik of Algiers, and gave it its last glory before the French invasion. His biography is relatively well known because the French archivist Albert Devoulx has found important documents, including a precious &quot;register of prizes&quot; opened by the authorities of the Deylik in 1765. Songs and legends have also taken hold of this charismatic character.

==In fiction==
Barbary corsairs are protagonists in &quot;Le pantere di Algeri (the panthers of Algiers)&quot; by Emilio Salgari. They were featured in a number of other noted novels, including &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; by Daniel Defoe, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; by Kenneth Grahame, &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; and the &quot;Sword of Islam&quot; by Rafael Sabatini, &quot;The Algerine Captive&quot; by Royall Tyler, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, the &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot; by Neal Stephenson, &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; by Louis Lamour, &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; by Hugh Lofting, &quot;Corsair&quot; by Clive Cussler, &quot;Tanar of Pellucidar&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and &quot;Angélique in Barbary&quot; by Anne Golon.

Miguel de Cervantes, the Spanish author, was captive for five years as a slave in the &quot;bagnio&quot; of Algiers, and reflected his experience in some of his fictional (but not directly autobiographical) writings, including the Captive&#x27;s tale in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, his two plays set in Algiers, &quot;El Trato de Argel&quot; (The Treaty of Algiers) and &quot;Los Baños de Argel&quot; (The Baths of Algiers), and episodes in a number of other works.

In Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (a Singspiel), two European ladies are discovered in a Turkish harem, presumably captured by Barbary corsairs. Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; is based on the capture of several slaves by Barbary corsairs led by the bey of Algiers.

<doc id="558832" wikidata="Q3499037" url="?curid=558832" title="Steve O'Neill">
<text>Stephen Francis O&#x27;Neill (July 6, 1891 – January 26, 1962) was an American professional baseball catcher and manager. He played his first 13 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. As a manager, he led the Detroit Tigers to a World Series championship.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neill was born in Minooka, Pennsylvania (now a part of Scranton), to Irish immigrants from Maum, County Galway, Michael &quot;Squire&quot; O&#x27;Neill and Mary ( Joyce) O&#x27;Neill. He was one of four brothers who escaped a life in the coal mines by playing in the major leagues. They were Jack, a catcher in the National League (1902–1906); Mike, a right-handed pitcher in the NL (1901–1904, 1907); and Jim, an infielder with the American League Washington Senators (1920, 1923). Baseball historian William C. Kashatus noted that Michael and Jack &quot;would become the first brother battery in major league history&quot;. The O&#x27;Neill brothers &quot;were known to exchange their signals in Gaelic in order to fool the opposing coaches&quot;.

Later, two of Steve O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s daughters married professional baseball players, one of whom was Skeeter Webb, who played under O&#x27;Neill in the minor leagues in 1939 and again from 1945–1947, when O&#x27;Neill piloted the Tigers.

==Baseball career==
O&#x27;Neill first played professional baseball in 1910 with the Elmira Colonels, managed by his brother Mike as a backup catcher. An injury opened the door to him getting playing time that saw him catch well enough to attract attention. He was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics, led by Connie Mack. He played for Worcester in the New England League for 1911 before he was sent to the Cleveland Naps on August 20 in a sale by Mack at the request of Harry Davis (a longtime player for Mack), who had signed on to serve as player-manager for the 1912 season.

Steve would end up having the most successful playing career of the O&#x27;Neill brothers, serving as a catcher for 17 years in the American League. He made his major league debut as a September call-up on the 18th in 1911 for the Naps against the Boston Red Sox. He went 1-for-4 while stealing a base. He would spend the next twelve years with the team. He appeared in eight other games, collecting four total hits. He gradually played more for Cleveland in the next three seasons, going from 69 to 80 to 87 games; in 1913, while batting .295 in eighty games, he received votes enough to finish 24th in MVP voting. He then played a majority of a season for the first time in 1915, playing in 121 games while batting .236 with 91 hits and 34 RBIs; he hit two home runs that season, the first of just thirteen in his career. Aside from 1917, when he batted .184, he would bat above .230 for the rest of his career. O&#x27;Neill collected his first hundred hit season in 1919, doing so by collecting 115 hits in 125 games while driving in 47 runs; he batted .289 while also collecting 35 doubles with 48 walks and 21 strikeouts. The following year, he had his finest and longest season. He played 149 games and batted .321 with 55 RBIs and career highs in hits (157), doubles (39), and home runs (three). His final home run of that season came in the moment of tragedy. On August 16, he hit a home run off Carl Mays of the New York Yankees. That same night, as he drove in another run to win the game for Cleveland 4-3, a Mays fastball hit Ray Chapman in the head that saw him die that night; O&#x27;Neill and the rest of the team saw his body before the funeral and he fainted after seeing him in the casket. That season saw Cleveland win the American League pennant for the first time ever. In the 1920 World Series, O&#x27;Neill batted .333 by going 7-for-21 while driving in two runs (both in Game 1, which Cleveland won 3-0) as they beat the Brooklyn Robins in seven games.

He was dealt by Cleveland in a seven-player deal that saw them trade Dan Boone, Joe Connolly, Bill Wambsganss, and O&#x27;Neill to the Boston Red Sox for George Burns, Chick Fewster and Roxy Walters for the 1924 season. He batted .238 in 106 games while having 73 hits with 38 RBIs. He was put on waivers and picked up by the New York Yankees on December 15, 1924. In 1925, he played in just 35 games and batted .286 with 26 hits and 10 RBIs before being released. He spent the next two years in the International League before returning to the majors to play with the St. Louis Browns in 1927, where he played 84 combined games in two seasons; his final highlight came in that season: On May 17, facing Howard Ehmke, he hit a shot to left field for his thirteenth and final home run of his career. During his last season in 1928, while riding a cab in New York City, he was hit by a truck that nearly killed him. His final game came on September 14. Facing the Chicago White Sox, he went 0-for-3. O&#x27;Neill compiled a batting average of .263 with 1,259 hits, thirteen home runs and 537 runs batted in (RBI) in 1,590 games.

==Managerial career==
When his playing career ended, O&#x27;Neill turned to managing in the minors. He started by managing the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League from 1929 to 1931, serving as player-manager. He then managed the Toledo Mud Hens from 1932 to 1934. He soon gained a reputation for cultivating talented young players, some of whom went on to become Hall of Famers. As a big league manager with four teams—the Indians (1935–1937), Tigers (1943–1948), Red Sox (1950–1951) and Philadelphia Phillies (1952–1954)—O&#x27;Neill never had a losing record. His Tigers won the 1945 World Series (when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in the Cubs&#x27; last Fall Classic appearance until 2016) and O&#x27;Neill was known for turning around under-performing teams, often in mid-season.

He was hired by Cleveland manager Walter Johnson in 1935 as a pitching coach due to his success with Toledo. However, O&#x27;Neill would become manager of the team after Johnson was fired when the team was 46-48. O&#x27;Neil led them to 36 wins in the remaining sixty games of the year to result in a 82—71 overall record (with three ties). The 1935 team finished third, but his next two teams finished fifth and fourth while racking up eighty wins before he was let go. He returned to minor league managing with the Buffalo Bisons in 1938, where he stayed until 1940 to serve as coach with the Detroit Tigers for a year. He then moved over to Detroit&#x27;s minor league team in the Beaumont Exporters for the 1942 season. He was then hired for 1944 by the Tigers as manager to replace Del Baker. While the Tigers only saw a five-game improvement in wins with O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first team, it was their first winning season since 1940. The next year, they went 88—66 on the strength of Hal Newhouser, who won MVP as a pitcher. The Tigers led the American League as late as September 26 before playing their final series against the Washington Senators with the St. Louis Browns close. The Tigers, having to play four games in three days, would split the series while St. Louis edged them out on the final day of the season to win the pennant. The next year, the Tigers would be involved in another pennant race that saw them come out on top; they took the lead for the pennant on June 27 for good, finishing 1.5 games ahead of Washington to clinch the pennant while Newhouser won the pitching Triple Crown and another MVP. In the 1945 World Series, facing Charlie Grimm and the 98-win Chicago Cubs, the Tigers ended up losing two of the three games in Detroit before the series shifted to Chicago for Game 4. They won the next two games to take a 3—2 series lead before a twelve-inning thriller in Game 6 saw the series tied. In Game 7, the Tigers would rely on Newhouser (who started Game 1 and 5 with a win in the latter) to carry them through with run support as they won 9-3 to win their first world title since 1935. The 1946 team finished second with 92 wins as the Boston Red Sox trounced the League with over 100 wins, and the next year saw them win 85 games but still finish second. A fifth place finish in 1948 saw him let go by the Tigers in favor of Red Rolfe.

O&#x27;Neill served as a scout for the 1949 Red Sox before being hired to take over as Boston&#x27;s third-base coach upon the sudden death of incumbent Kiki Cuyler. However, he was asked midway through the season to take over for Joe McCarthy as manager after general manager Joe Cronin asked him to resign; at the time the team was 31–28, but O&#x27;Neill led them to 63 wins in 95 games for an overall finish of 94–60. The Red Sox became the first post-World War II team to score over 1,000 runs in a season while also becoming the last (as of 2025) to record a batting average over .300. As late as September 18, they were just a game behind for the league pennant, but a late-season slump saw them lose seven of their last twelve games, which included three double-headers (with two wins out of six). The 1951 season proved to be an indicator of diminishing returns, as it would be the first of sixteen straight seasons where Boston did not win ninety games. They finished with a record of 87–67 for third place, eleven games behind the Yankees once again; O&#x27;Neill was replaced by Lou Boudreau. At the time that O&#x27;Neill had been let go from the Red Sox, he had won 150 games and lost 99, and combined with his 199–168 record with Cleveland and 509–414 mark with Detroit, he had a managerial record of 858–681.

He took over for the Philadelphia Phillies midway through the 1952 season. Eddie Sawyer had led the 1950 team (dubbed the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; by the press) to the National League pennant, owing to the generally youthful status of the players (such as future Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn). However, they had dovetailed from first to fifth the previous year, and a 28-35 record on June 27 meant that Sawyer was let go for O&#x27;Neill. He proceeded to win 59 out of the next 91 games, gradually moving them to a fourth-place finish. He won 83 games the next season (with two ties), which ended with his 1,000th win at the end of the season while finishing in a tie for third place with the St. Louis Cardinals (22 games back of the pennant winners). However, he did not finish the next season. With a record of 40–37, he was fired on July 15 for Terry Moore (Moore would win just 35 games the rest of the way).

==Legacy==
His career winning percentage over fourteen seasons was a stalwart .559 (1,040 victories with 821 losses and eighteen ties). O&#x27;Neill is one of 23 managers with a winning percentage of .540 while also winning 1,000 games and he is also one of twelve managers to win 1,000 games without having also lost 1,000 games. Legendary players who benefited from O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s guidance included Lou Boudreau, Bob Feller, Hal Newhouser, and Robin Roberts. O&#x27;Neill was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame. He was also an inaugural member of the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill died at age 70 in Cleveland, Ohio, after suffering a heart attack, and is interred in St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery, Minooka.

<doc id="558842" wikidata="Q19339" url="?curid=558842" title="O. Henry Award">
<text>The O. Henry Award is an annual American award given to short stories of exceptional merit. The award is named after the American short-story writer O. Henry.

The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories is an annual collection of the year&#x27;s twenty best stories published in U.S. and Canadian magazines. Along with &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;, the O. Henry Prize Stories is one of the two &quot;best-known annual anthologies of short fiction.&quot;

Until 2002 there were first, second, and third prize winners and from 2003 to 2019 there were three jurors who each selected a short story of special interest or merit; the collection is called &quot;The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories&quot;, and the original collection was called &quot;Prize Stories 1919: The O. Henry Memorial Awards&quot;.

==History and format==
The award was first presented in 1919 and funded by the Society of Arts and Sciences. 

 the guest editor chooses twenty short stories, each an O. Henry Prize story. All stories published in an American or Canadian periodical are eligible for consideration, including stories that have been translated into English. The goal of &quot;The O. Henry Prize Stories&quot; remains to strengthen the art of the short story.

The current series editor for &quot;The O. Henry Prize Stories&quot; is Jenny Minton Quigley. Past series editors have been: Blanche Colton Williams (1919–32), Harry Hansen (1933–40), Herschel Brickell (1941–51), Paul Engle (1954–59), Mary Stegner (1960), Richard Poirier (1961–66, assisted by William Abrahams, 1964–66), William Abrahams (1967–96), Larry Dark (1997–2002) and Laura Furman (2003–2019). There were no volumes of the series in 1952 and 1953 (due to Herschel Brickell&#x27;s death), 2004 and 2020.

==Partnership with PEN American Center==
In 2009 &quot;The O. Henry Prize Stories&quot; publisher, Anchor Books, renamed the series in partnership with the PEN American Center (today PEN America), producing the first &quot;PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories&quot; collection. Proceeds from the &quot;PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories 2009&quot; would be directed to PEN&#x27;s Readers &amp; Writers Program, which sends well-known authors to under served inner-city schools. 

The selection included stories by Graham Joyce, John Burnside, Roger Nash, Manuel Muñoz, Ha Jin, Paul Theroux, Judy Troy, Nadine Gordimer, Marisa Silver, Paul Yoon, Andrew Sean Greer, and Junot Díaz, with A. S. Byatt, Tim O&#x27;Brien and Anthony Doerr – all authors of past O. Henry Prize Stories – serving as the prize jury.

In an interview for the Vintage Books and Anchor Books blog, editor Laura Furman called the collaboration with PEN a &quot;natural partnership&quot;.
