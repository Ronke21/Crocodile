In the aftermath of the Japanese invasion of Thailand on 7–8 December 1941, the regime of Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Phibun) declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on 25 January 1942. Seni Pramoj, the Thai ambassador in Washington, refused to deliver the declaration to the United States government.

Accordingly, the United States refrained from declaring war on Thailand. Seni, a conservative aristocrat whose anti-Japanese credentials were well established, organized the Free Thai Movement with American assistance, recruiting Thai students in the United States to work with the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The OSS trained Thai personnel for underground activities, and units were readied to infiltrate Thailand. By the end of the war, more than 50,000 Thais had been trained and armed to resist the Japanese by Free Thai members who had been parachuted into the country.

==World War II and Japanese occupation==

Phibun&#x27;s alliance with Japan during the early years of war was initially popular. The Royal Thai Army joined Japan&#x27;s Burma campaign with the goal of recovering their historical claims to part of the Shan states, previously surrendered to the Burmese Empire in the Burmese–Siamese wars and subsequently annexed by the British following the Third Anglo-Burmese War. They gained the return of the four northernmost Malay states lost in the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, and with Japanese mediation in the Franco–Thai war they also recovered territory lost in the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893. 

However, Japan had stationed 150,000 troops on Thai soil, and as the war dragged on, the Japanese increasingly treated Thailand as a conquered country rather than an ally. Although the United States had not officially declared war, on 26 December 1942, US Tenth Air Force bombers based in India launched the first major bombing raid, which damaged targets in Bangkok and elsewhere and caused several thousand casualties. Public opinion, and even more importantly the sympathies of the civilian political elite, moved perceptibly against Phibun&#x27;s alliance with Japan.

The Free Thai Movement was supported by British Force 136 and the American OSS – both provided valuable intelligence from within Thailand.

===Pridi and the civilian regime, 1944–1947===

In June 1944, Phibun was forced out of office and replaced by the first predominantly civilian government since the 1932 coup. Allied bombing raids continued, and a B-29 raid on Bangkok destroyed the two key power plants on 14 April 1945, leaving the city without power and water. Throughout the bombing campaign, the Seri Thai network was effective in broadcasting weather reports to the Allied air forces and in rescuing downed Allied airmen. The new government was headed by Khuang Aphaiwong, a civilian linked politically with conservatives such as Seni. The most influential figure in the regime, however, was Pridi Banomyong (who was serving as Regent of Thailand), whose anti-Japanese views were increasingly attractive to the Thais. In the last year of the war, Allied agents were tacitly given free access by Bangkok. As the war came to an end, Thailand repudiated its wartime agreements with Japan.

Unfortunately, the civilian leaders were unable to achieve unity. After falling-out with Pridi, Khuang was replaced as prime minister by the Regent&#x27;s nominee, Seni, who had returned to Thailand from his post as leader of the Free Thai movement in Washington. The scramble for power among factions in late 1945 created political divisions among the civilian leaders that destroyed their potential for making a common stand against the resurgent political force of the Royal Thai Armed Forces in the immediate postwar years.

Postwar accommodations with the Allies also weakened the civilian government. As a result of the contributions made to the Allied war efforts by the Free Thai Movement, the United States, which unlike other Allied countries had never officially been at war with Thailand, refrained from dealing with Thailand as an enemy country in postwar peace negotiations. Before signing a peace treaty, however, the United Kingdom demanded war reparations in the form of rice shipments to Malaya, and France refused to permit admission of Thailand to the United Nations (UN) until the Indochinese areas regained by the Thais during the war were returned to France. The Soviet Union insisted on the repeal of Thailand&#x27;s anti-communist legislation.

==Heritage==

Sakon Nakhon historical attractions include a cave well camouflaged by lush vegetation called Tham Seree Thai (ถ้ำเสรีไทย &quot;Seri Thai Cave&quot;), that was used for storage of arms and food during World War II.

<text>Abdullah Ibrahim (born Adolph Johannes Brand on 9 October 1934), previously known as Dollar Brand, is a South African pianist and composer. His music reflects many of the musical influences of his childhood in the multicultural port areas of Cape Town, ranging from traditional African songs to the gospel of the AME Church and Ragas, to more modern jazz and other Western styles. Ibrahim is considered the leading figure in the subgenre of Cape jazz. Within jazz, his music particularly reflects the influence of Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington. He is known especially for &quot;Mannenberg&quot;, a jazz piece that became a notable anti-apartheid anthem.

During the apartheid era in the 1960s, Ibrahim moved to New York City and, apart from a brief return to South Africa in the 1970s, remained in exile until the early 1990s. Over the decades, he has toured the world extensively, appearing at major venues either as a solo artist or playing with other renowned musicians, including Max Roach, Carlos Ward and Randy Weston, as well as collaborating with classical orchestras in Europe.

With his wife, the jazz singer Sathima Bea Benjamin, Ibrahim is father to two children, including the New York underground rapper Jean Grae.

==Biography==
Ibrahim was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on 9 October 1934, and was baptized Adolph Johannes Brand. He attended Trafalgar High School in Cape Town&#x27;s District Six, and began piano lessons at the age of seven, making his professional debut at 15. He is of mixed-race heritage, making him a Coloured person according to the apartheid system. His mother played piano in a church, the musical style of which would remain an influence on him; in addition, he learned to play several genres of music during his youth in Cape Town, including &quot;marabi&quot;, &quot;mbaqanga&quot;, and American jazz. He became well known in jazz circles in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

In 1959 and 1960, Ibrahim played with the Jazz Epistles group in Sophiatown, alongside saxophonists Kippie Moeketsi and Mackay Davashe, trumpeter Hugh Masekela, trombonist Jonas Gwangwa (who were all in the orchestra of the musical &quot;King Kong&quot; that opened in Johannesburg in February 1959), bassist Johnny Gertze and drummer Makaya Ntshoko; in January 1960, the six musicians went into the Gallo studio and recorded the first full-length jazz LP by Black South African musicians, &quot;Jazz Epistle Verse One&quot;, with 500 copies being produced. Although the group avoided explicitly political activity, the apartheid government was suspicious of it and other jazz groups, and targeted them heavily during the increase in state repression following the Sharpeville massacre in March 1960, and eventually, the Jazz Epistles broke up.

==Early international career==
Ibrahim moved to Europe in 1962. In February 1963, his wife-to-be, Sathima Bea Benjamin (they married in 1965), convinced Duke Ellington, who was in Zürich, Switzerland, on a European tour, to come to hear Ibrahim perform as &quot;The Dollar Brand Trio&quot; in Zurich&#x27;s &quot;Africana Club&quot;. After the show, Ellington helped set up a recording session with Reprise Records: &quot;Duke Ellington presents The Dollar Brand Trio&quot;. A second recording of the trio (also with Ellington and Billy Strayhorn on piano) performing with Sathima as vocalist was recorded, but remained unreleased until 1996 (&quot;A Morning in Paris&quot;, under Benjamin&#x27;s name). The Dollar Brand Trio (with Johnny Gertze on bass and Makaya Ntshoko on drums) subsequently played at many European festivals, as well as on radio and television.

Ibrahim and Benjamin moved to New York in 1965 and that year he played at the Newport Jazz Festival, followed by a first tour through the US; in 1966 Ibrahim substituted for Duke Ellington on five dates, leading the Duke Ellington Orchestra. In 1967, a Rockefeller Foundation grant enabled him to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. While in the US he interacted with many progressive musicians, among them Don Cherry, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, Cecil Taylor and Archie Shepp. As the Black Power movement developed in the 1960s and 1970s, it influenced a number of Ibrahim&#x27;s friends and collaborators, who began to see their music as a form of cultural nationalism. Ibrahim in turn began to incorporate African elements into his jazz.

==Return to South Africa==
In 1968, Ibrahim briefly returned to Cape Town, where he converted to Islam that year (with the resultant change of name from Dollar Brand to Abdullah Ibrahim) and in 1970 he made a pilgrimage to Mecca.

He met Rashid Vally at the latter&#x27;s Kohinoor record shop in Johannesburg in the early 1970s, and Vally produced two of Ibrahim&#x27;s albums in the following years. The pair produced a third album in 1974, titled &quot;Underground in Africa&quot;, in which Ibrahim abandoned his financially unsuccessful folk-infused jazz of the previous albums. Instead, the new album was a fusion of jazz, rock music, and South Africa popular music, and sold well. While recording &quot;Underground&quot;, Ibrahim collaborated with Oswietie, a local band of which Robbie Jansen and Basil Coetzee were saxophonists, and who played a large role in creating the album&#x27;s fusion style. After the success of &quot;Underground&quot;, Ibrahim asked Coetzee to bring together a supporting band for his next recording: the group Coetzee put together included Jansen, as well as others who had not worked on &quot;Underground&quot;. The composition &quot;Mannenberg&quot; was recorded in June 1974 during one of Ibrahim&#x27;s visits back to South Africa, in a studio in Cape Town, and was produced by Rashid Vally. The track was recorded in one take during a period of collective improvisation. The piece was inspired by the Cape Flats township where many of those forcibly removed from District Six were sent.

The recordings made with Jansen and Coetzee, including &quot;Mannenberg&quot; (renamed &quot;Capetown Fringe&quot; in its US release), &quot;Black Lightning&quot;; &quot;African Herbs&quot;; and &quot;Soweto Is Where It Is At&quot; – sounds that mirrored and spoke of the defiance in the streets and townships of South Africa – gave impetus to the genre of music known as &quot;Cape Jazz.&quot; &quot;Mannenberg&quot; came to be considered &quot;the unofficial national anthem&quot; of South Africa, and the theme tune of the anti-apartheid movement. Saxophonist and flautist Carlos Ward was Ibrahim&#x27;s sideman in duets during the early 1980s. A few years after the release of &quot;Mannenberg&quot; (released in 1974), South African police fired upon protesting children during the Soweto Uprising that began on 16 June 1976; this event led Ibrahim and Benjamin to publicly express support for the African National Congress, which was still banned at the time.

Soon returning to the US and settling in New York, Ibrahim and Sathima founded the record company Ekapa (meaning &quot;Cape Town&quot;) in 1981.

Starting in 1983, Ibrahim led a group called Ekaya (which translates as &quot;home&quot;), as well as various trios, occasional big bands and other special projects.

==Film and television work==
Ibrahim has written the soundtracks for a number of films, including &quot;Chocolat&quot; (1988), and &quot;No Fear, No Die&quot; (1990).

On 25 November 1989, he made an extended appearance in the British Channel 4 television discussion series &quot;After Dark&quot; alongside Zoë Wicomb, Donald Woods, Shula Marks and others. Ibrahim also took part in the 2002 documentary &quot;Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony&quot;, where he and others recalled the days of apartheid; the film&#x27;s subtitle derives from observations made by Ibrahim.
Ibrahim is the subject of the documentaries &quot;A Brother with Perfect Timing&quot; (1987) and &quot;A Struggle for Love&quot; (2005, directed by Ciro Cappellari).

==Post-apartheid==
Ibrahim has worked as a solo performer, typically in unbroken concerts that echo the unstoppable impetus of the old marabi performers, classical impressionists and snatches of his musical idols – Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and Fats Waller. He also performs frequently with trios and quartets and larger orchestral units. Since his return to South Africa in the early 1990s, he has been feted with symphony orchestra performances, one of which was in honour of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 1994 inauguration as president. Mandela reportedly referred to him as &quot;our Mozart&quot;.

In 1997, Ibrahim collaborated on a tour with drummer Max Roach, and the following year undertook a world tour with the Munich Radio Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1999, he founded the &quot;M7&quot; academy for South African musicians in Cape Town and was the initiator of the Cape Town Jazz Orchestra, an 18-piece big band launched in September 2006.

Ibrahim continues to perform internationally, mainly in Europe, and with occasional shows in North America. Reviewing his 2008 concert at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre – a &quot;monumental&quot; show with the BBC Big Band, featuring vocalists Ian Shaw and Cleveland Watkiss – John Fordham of &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to &quot;[Ibrahim&#x27;s] elder-statesman status as the African Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk combined (and his role as an educator and political campaigner)&quot;.

In 2016, at Emperors Palace, Johannesburg, Ibrahim and Hugh Masekela performed together for the first time in 60 years, reuniting the Jazz Epistles in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the historic 16 June 1976 youth demonstrations.

Reviewing Ibrahim&#x27;s July 2023 appearance with bassist Noah Jackson and flautist Cleave Guyton at the Barbican Centre, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: &quot;Ibrahim&#x27;s enduring love of the founding fathers of modern jazz is made clear from the outset as the trio starts with rhapsodic versions of two timeless anthems, Ellington&#x27;s &#x27;In A Sentimental Mood&#x27; and Coltrane&#x27;s &#x27;Giant Steps&#x27;, while later on we are treated to a spirited take on Monk&#x27;s &#x27;Skippy&#x27;. But in the interim it is Ibrahim’s originals that take pride of place, showing how, since the &#x27;60s, he has been creating standards of his own that vividly capture the poised dignity of African culture and customs.&quot;

==Awards==
In 2007, Ibrahim was presented with the South African Music Lifetime Achievement Award, given by the Recording Industry of South Africa, in a ceremony at the Sun City Superbowl.

In 2009, for his solo piano album &quot;Senzo&quot; he received the &quot;Best Male Artist&quot; award at the 15th Annual MTN South African Music Awards.

In 2009, the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, conferred on Ibrahim an Honorary Doctorate of Music. Also in 2009, he was awarded South Africa&#x27;s national honour the Order of Ikhamanga (Silver), &quot;For his excellent contribution to the arts, putting South Africa on the international map and his fight against racism and apartheid.&quot;

In July 2017, Ibrahim was honoured with the German Jazz Trophy.

In July 2018, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) announced Abdullah Ibrahim as one of four recipients of the NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships, to be celebrated in a concert on 15 April 2019 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. Awarded in recognition of lifetime achievement, the honor is bestowed on individuals who have made significant contributions to the art form, the other 2019 recipients being Bob Dorough, Maria Schneider, and Stanley Crouch.

<doc id="556996" wikidata="Q605989" url="?curid=556996" title="Arthur B. Reeve">
<text>Arthur Benjamin Reeve (October 15, 1880 – August 9, 1936) was an American mystery writer. He is known best for creating the series character Professor Craig Kennedy, sometimes called &quot;The American Sherlock Holmes&quot;, and Kennedy&#x27;s Dr. Watson-like sidekick Walter Jameson, a newspaper reporter, for 18 detective novels. Reeve is famous mostly for the 82 Craig Kennedy stories, published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine between 1910 and 1918. These were collected in book form; with the third collection, the short stories were published grouped together as episodic novels. The 12-volume publication Craig Kennedy Stories was released during 1918; it reissued Reeve&#x27;s books-to-date as a matched set.

==Biography==
Born in Brooklyn, Reeve graduated from Princeton and attended New York Law School. He worked as an editor and journalist before acquiring fame from the first Craig Kennedy story during 1911. Raised in Brooklyn, he lived most of his professional life at various addresses near Long Island Sound. In 1932, he relocated to New Jersey (Trenton) to be nearer his alma mater, Princeton. He died in Trenton in 1936.

Starting with &quot;The Exploits of Elaine&quot; (1914), Reeve began authoring screenplays. His movie career was the most productive during 1919-20, when his name was credited for seven movies, most of them serials, three of them featuring Harry Houdini. After that, probably because of the movie industry&#x27;s migration to Hollywood and Reeve&#x27;s desire to remain in the east, Reeve worked more sporadically with movies. He published much fiction originally in newspapers, and a variety of magazines including &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, &quot;Country Gentleman&quot;, and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Eventually, he was published only in pulps such as &quot;Detective Fiction Weekly&quot; and &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;. During 1927, Reeve contracted with (with John S. Lopez) to write a series of movie scenarios for the notorious millionaire-murderer, Harry K. Thaw, on the subject of fake spiritualists. The deal resulted in a lawsuit when Thaw refused to pay. During late 1928, Reeve declared bankruptcy.

During the 1930s, Reeve changed his career by becoming an anti-rackets crusader. He hosted a national radio program from July 1930 to March 1931, published a history of the rackets titled &quot;The Golden Age of Crime&quot;, and the emphasis of his Craig Kennedy stories completed Reeve&#x27;s transition from &quot;scientific detective&quot; work to conbatting organized crime.

During his career, Reeve reported many celebrated crime cases for various newspapers, including the murder of William Desmond Taylor in 1922, and the trial of Lindbergh baby kidnapper, Bruno Hauptmann, who was executed in 1936.

<doc id="557000" wikidata="Q7437828" url="?curid=557000" title="Scottish Labour Party (1888)">
<text>The Scottish Labour Party (SLP), also known as the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party, was formed by Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, the first socialist MP in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, who later went on to become the first president of the Scottish National Party, and Keir Hardie, who later became the first leader of the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Party.

==History==
The initial spur for the party&#x27;s foundation was Hardie&#x27;s unsuccessful independent Labour candidature in the 1888 Mid Lanarkshire by-election. He had tried and failed to gain Liberal Party support for his candidature, and the experience convinced many of his fellow miners of the need for an independent party representing the interests of labour. The cause also appealed to some radicals, and his movement gained the support of the Dundee Radical Association. Like many of the party&#x27;s initial members, Hardie had previously been involved in the Scottish Land Restoration League.

A preliminary meeting was held in Glasgow in May, and a foundation conference was held on 25 August. This was chaired by Cunninghame Graham, while other attendees included Irish nationalist politician John Ferguson, crofter John Murdoch, land reformer Shaw Maxwell and miners&#x27; leader Robert Smillie. However, the organised socialist movement was not initially involved; both the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist League boycotted the event. The diverse factions had very different perspectives on the party&#x27;s future, but were able to agree a programme, largely based on a draft by Hardie.

Hardie became the party&#x27;s Secretary, while George Mitchell was the first Treasurer and Cunninghame Graham was the President.

===Dispute===
R B Cunninghame Graham, a strong supporter of Scottish independence, was the party&#x27;s main MP, for the North West Lanarkshire constituency, between his defection from the Liberal Party in 1888 and his defeat in the United Kingdom general election 1892, in the Glasgow Camlachie constituency. Two other MPs, Gavin Clark and Charles Conybeare, held honorary offices in the party until January 1893. Following their departure, with many of the other radicals, the party declared itself in favour of socialism, and prohibited officials (but not other members) from dual membership with other political parties. The party ran two other candidates in 1892: J. Bennett Burleigh in Glasgow Tradeston and James MacDonald in Dundee. Attempts by Cunninghame Graham and Shaw Maxwell to arrange a non-contest pact with the Liberals failed, and the SLP candidates did not poll well.

===Dissolution===
The party initially supported Henry Hyde Champion&#x27;s trades council movement, but became concerned when it formed the Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party under the secretaryship of Chisholm Robertson, presenting itself as a potential rival to the Scottish Labour Party. However, Champion&#x27;s movement soon faded, while it did serve to move some trades councils to a position supporting independent labour candidates, and closer co-operation with the Scottish Labour Party.

In 1894, Hardie became President of the new Independent Labour Party (ILP), and the vast majority of Scottish Labour Party members supported him. In early 1895 the SLP dissolved itself into the ILP.

<doc id="557007" wikidata="Q329" url="?curid=557007" title="Nicolas Sarkozy">
<text>Nicolas Paul Stéphane Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa ( ; ; born 28 January 1955) is a French politician who served as President of France from 2007 to 2012. In 2021, he was found guilty of having tried to bribe a judge in 2014 to obtain information and spending beyond legal campaign funding limits during his 2012 re-election campaign.

Born in Paris, his roots are 1/2 Hungarian Protestant, 1/4 Greek Jewish, and 1/4 French Catholic. Mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1983 to 2002, he was Minister of the Budget under Prime Minister Édouard Balladur (1993–1995) during François Mitterrand&#x27;s second term. During Jacques Chirac&#x27;s second presidential term, he served as Minister of the Interior and as Minister of Finances. He was the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party from 2004 to 2007.

He won the 2007 French presidential election by a 53.1% to 46.9% margin against Ségolène Royal, the Socialist Party (PS) candidate. During his term, he faced the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the late-2000s recession, and the European sovereign debt crisis, the Russo-Georgian War (for which he negotiated a ceasefire), and the Arab Spring (especially in Tunisia, Libya, and Syria). He initiated the reform of French universities (2007) and the pension reform (2010). He married Italian-French singer-songwriter Carla Bruni in 2008 at the Élysée Palace in Paris.

In the 2012 French presidential election, Sarkozy was defeated by the PS candidate François Hollande by a 3.2% margin. After leaving the presidential office, Sarkozy vowed to retire from public life before coming back in 2014 and being reelected as UMP leader (renamed The Republicans in 2015). Being defeated at the Republican presidential primary in 2016, he retired from public life.

He was charged with corruption by French prosecutors in two cases, notably concerning the alleged Libyan interference in the 2007 French elections. In 2021, Sarkozy was convicted of corruption in two separate trials. His first conviction resulted in him receiving a sentence of three years, two suspended, and one in prison; he appealed against the ruling. He received a one-year sentence for his second conviction, which he is allowed to serve under home confinement. In May 2023, Sarkozy lost an appeal against his corruption conviction. In February 2024, his one-year sentence for the campaign finance conviction was revised so he would instead serve six months in prison and six months suspended.

== Personal life ==
=== Family background ===
Sarkozy was born in Paris and is the son of Pál István Ernő Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa (; —in some sources &quot;Nagy-Bócsay Sárközy Pál István Ernő&quot;; 5 May 1928 – 4 March 2023), a Protestant Hungarian aristocrat, and Andrée Jeanne &quot;Dadu&quot; Mallah (12 October 1925 – 12 December 2017), whose Ottoman Greek Jewish father (Sarkozy&#x27;s grandfather) converted to Catholicism to marry Sarkozy&#x27;s French Catholic maternal grandmother. They were married in the Saint-François-de-Sales church, 17th arrondissement of Paris, on 8 February 1950, and divorced in 1959.

===Early life===
During Sarkozy&#x27;s childhood, his father founded his own advertising agency and became wealthy. The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. The family later moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, one of the wealthiest communes of the Île-de-France &quot;région&quot; immediately west of Paris. According to Sarkozy, his staunchly Gaullist grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was raised Catholic.

Sarkozy said that being kept at a distance by his father shaped much of who he is today. He also has said that, in his early years, he felt inferior to his wealthier and taller classmates. He has spoken about the difficulties he faced as a child of divorced parents at a time when divorce was uncommon. &quot;What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood&quot;, he said later.

===Education===
Sarkozy was enrolled in the &quot;Lycée Chaptal&quot;, a well regarded public middle and high school in Paris&#x27; 8th arrondissement, where he failed his &quot;sixième&quot;. His family then sent him to the &quot;Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau&quot;, a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre student, but where he nonetheless obtained his &quot;baccalauréat&quot; in 1973.

Sarkozy enrolled at the &quot;Université Paris X Nanterre&quot;, where he graduated with an M.A. in private law and, later, with a D.E.A. degree in business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the May &#x27;68 student movement and was still a stronghold of leftist students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organization, in which he was very active. He completed his military service as a part-time Air Force cleaner.

After graduating from university, Sarkozy entered Sciences Po, where he studied between 1979 and 1981, but failed to graduate due to an insufficient command of the English language.

After passing the bar, Sarkozy became a lawyer specializing in business and family law and was one of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s French lawyers.

===Marriages===

====Marie-Dominique Culioli====
Sarkozy married his first wife, Marie-Dominique Culioli, on 23 September 1982, with prominent right-wing politician Charles Pasqua serving as best man. (Pasqua later became a political opponent.) Culioli&#x27;s father was a pharmacist from Vico (a village north of Ajaccio, Corsica); her uncle was Achille Peretti, the mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1947 to 1983 and Sarkozy&#x27;s political mentor. They had two sons, Pierre (born in 1985), now a hip-hop producer, and Jean (born in 1986), now a local politician in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine, where Sarkozy started his own political career. Sarkozy divorced Culioli in 1996, after they had been separated for several years.

====Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz====
As mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz (great-granddaughter of composer Isaac Albéniz and daughter of a Moldovan father), when he officiated at her wedding to television host Jacques Martin. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced one year later. She and Sarkozy married in October 1996, with witnesses Martin Bouygues and Bernard Arnault. They have one son, Louis, born 23 April 1997.

Between 2002 and 2005, the couple often appeared together on public occasions, with Cécilia Sarkozy acting as the chief aide for her husband. On 25 May 2005, however, the Swiss newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot; revealed that she had left Sarkozy for Moroccan national Richard Attias, head of Publicis in New York. There were other accusations of a private nature in &quot;Le Matin&quot;, which led to Sarkozy suing the paper. In the meantime, he was said to have had an affair with a journalist of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Anne Fulda.

Sarkozy and Cécilia ultimately divorced on 15 October 2007, soon after his election as president.

====Carla Bruni====

Less than a month after separating from Cécilia, Sarkozy met Italian-born singer, songwriter and former fashion model Carla Bruni at a dinner party, and soon entered into a relationship with her. They married on 2 February 2008 at the Élysée Palace in Paris.

The couple have a daughter, Giulia, born on 19 October 2011. It was the first time a French president has publicly had a child while in office.

===Personal wealth===
Sarkozy declared to the Constitutional Council a net worth of €2 million, most of the assets being in the form of life insurance policies. As the French President, one of his first actions was to give himself a pay raise: his yearly salary went from €101,000 to €240,000, matching other European officeholders. He is also entitled to a mayoral, parliamentarian and presidential pension as a former Mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, member of the National Assembly and President of France.

==Early political career==
Sarkozy is recognized by French parties on both the Right and Left as a skilled politician and striking orator. His supporters within France emphasize his charisma, political innovation and willingness to &quot;make a dramatic break&quot; amid mounting disaffection against &quot;politics as usual&quot;. Overall, he is considered more pro-American and pro-Israeli than most French politicians.

From 2004 to 2007, Sarkozy was president of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP), France&#x27;s major right-wing political party, and he was Minister of the Interior in the government of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, with the honorific title of Minister of State, making him effectively the number three official in the French State after President Jacques Chirac and Villepin. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as Minister of Worship: in this role he created the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM). Previously, he was a député in the French National Assembly. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including Finance Minister.

===In Government: 1993–1995===
Sarkozy&#x27;s political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in Neuilly-sur-Seine. A member of the Neo-Gaullist party RPR, he went on to be elected mayor of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor Achille Peretti. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti&#x27;s secretary. A more senior RPR councillor, Charles Pasqua, wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy took that opportunity to propel himself into the office of mayor. He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the National Assembly.

In 1993, Nicolas Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the &quot;Human Bomb&quot;, a man who had taken small children hostages in a kindergarten in Neuilly. The &quot;Human Bomb&quot; was killed after two days of talks by policemen of the RAID, who entered the school stealthily while the attacker was resting.

At the same time, from 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister Édouard Balladur. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a protégé of Jacques Chirac. During his tenure, he increased France&#x27;s public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of €200 billion (US$260 billion) (FY 1994–1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP. According to the Maastricht Treaty, the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France&#x27;s GDP.

In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed Édouard Balladur for President of France. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power.

However, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the 1997 parliamentary election, as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader Philippe Séguin resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the 1999 European Parliament election, winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident Rally for France of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.

In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see 2002 French presidential election), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, despite Sarkozy&#x27;s support of Edouard Balladur for President in 1995. Following Chirac&#x27;s 14 July keynote speech on road safety, Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads.

In the cabinet reshuffle of 30 April 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy&#x27;s intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of Alain Juppé became clear.

In party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy&#x27;s ascent was marked by the division of UMP between &quot;sarkozystes&quot;, such as Sarkozy&#x27;s &quot;first lieutenant&quot;, Brice Hortefeux, and Chirac loyalists, such as Jean-Louis Debré.

Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the National Assembly. (As required by the constitution, he had to resign as a deputy when he became minister in 2002.)

On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station &quot;France Info&quot; reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of Dominique de Villepin without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.

===First term as Minister of the Interior: 2002–2004===

Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004.

Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the Muslim community. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit Conseil français du culte musulman (&quot;French Council of the Muslim Faith&quot;), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims. In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public funds so that they are less reliant on money from outside France. It was not followed by any concrete measure.

===Minister of Finance: 2004===
During his short appointment as Minister of Finance, Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected &quot;libéralisme&quot; (a hands-off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state &quot;dirigisme&quot; (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the UMP.

* In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in France Télécom from 50.4 percent to 41 percent.
* Sarkozy backed a partial nationalisation of the large engineering company Alstom decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003.
* In June 2004, Sarkozy reached an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of two percent; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to one percent in September.
* Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF (solidarity tax on wealth). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the left and right. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as Alain Madelin, wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.

===Second term as Minister of the Interior: 2005–2007===

During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party.
However, the civil unrest in autumn 2005 put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from housing projects a &quot;rabble&quot; &quot;(&quot;&quot;)&quot; in Argenteuil near Paris, and controversially suggested cleansing the minority suburbs with a Kärcher. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on &quot;hoodlums&quot; and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities Azouz Begag.

After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants, greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents.

===UMP leader: 2004–2007===

Before he was elected President of France, Sarkozy was president of UMP, the French conservative party, elected with 85 percent of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members increased significantly. In 2005, he supported a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the French referendum on the European Constitution, but the &quot;No&quot; vote won.

Throughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France&#x27;s economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot; on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises. Among other issues:
* he called for a simplified and &quot;fairer&quot; taxation system, with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all &quot;direct&quot; taxes combined) at 50 percent of revenue;
* he approved measures reducing or denying social support to unemployed workers who refuse work offered to them;
* he pressed for a reduction in the budget deficit, claiming that the French state had been living off credit for some time.

Such policies are what are called in France &quot;libéral&quot; (that is, in favour of laissez-faire economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, &quot;ultra-libéral&quot;. Sarkozy rejects this label of &quot;libéral&quot; and prefers to call himself a pragmatist.

Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with quotas designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wanted to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enabled foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wanted to select the best students to the best curricula in France.

In early 2006, the French parliament adopted a controversial bill known as DADVSI, which reforms French copyright law. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of peer-to-peer systems.

===Presidential election: 2007===

Sarkozy was a likely candidate for the presidency in 2007; in an oft-repeated comment made on television channel France 2, when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, &quot;Not just when I shave&quot;.

On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was chosen by the UMP to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy, who was running unopposed, won 98 percent of the votes. Of the 327,000 UMP members who could vote, 69 percent participated in the online ballot.

In February 2007, Sarkozy appeared on a televised debate on TF1 where he expressed his support for affirmative action and the freedom to work overtime. Despite his opposition to same-sex marriage, he advocated civil unions and the possibility for same-sex partners to inherit under the same regime as married couples. The law was voted in July 2007.

On 7 February, Sarkozy decided in favour of a projected second, non-nuclear, aircraft carrier for the national Navy (adding to the nuclear &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;), during an official visit in Toulon with Defence Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie. &quot;This would allow permanently having an operational ship, taking into account the constraints of maintenance&quot;, he explained.

On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac announced his support for Sarkozy. Chirac pointed out that Sarkozy had been chosen as presidential candidate for the ruling UMP party, and said: &quot;So it is totally natural that I give him my vote and my support.&quot; To focus on his campaign, Sarkozy stepped down as Minister of the Interior on 26 March.

During the campaign, rival candidates had accused Sarkozy of being a &quot;candidate for brutality&quot; and of presenting hard-line views about France&#x27;s future. Opponents also accused him of courting conservative voters in policy-making in a bid to capitalise on right-wing sentiments among some communities. However, his popularity was sufficient to see him polling as the frontrunner throughout the later campaign period, consistently ahead of rival Socialist candidate, Ségolène Royal.
The first round of the presidential election was held on 22 April 2007. Sarkozy came in first with 31.18 percent of the votes, ahead of Ségolène Royal of the Socialists with 25.87 percent. In the second round, Sarkozy came out on top to win the election with 53.06 percent of the votes ahead of Ségolène Royal with 46.94 percent. In his speech immediately following the announcement of the election results, Sarkozy stressed the need for France&#x27;s modernisation, but also called for national unity, mentioning that Royal was in his thoughts. In that speech, he claimed &quot;The French have chosen to break with the ideas, habits and behaviour of the past. I will restore the value of work, authority, merit and respect for the nation.&quot;

==Presidency of France==
===Inauguration===

On 6 May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy became the sixth person to be elected President of the Fifth Republic (which was established in 1958), and the 23rd President in French history.

The official transfer of power from Chirac to Sarkozy took place on 16 May at 11:00 am (9:00 UTC) at the Élysée Palace, where he was given the authorization codes of the French nuclear arsenal. In the afternoon, the new president flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Under Sarkozy&#x27;s government, François Fillon replaced Dominique de Villepin as Prime Minister. Sarkozy appointed Bernard Kouchner, the left-wing founder of Médecins Sans Frontières, as his Foreign Minister, leading to Kouchner&#x27;s expulsion from the Socialist Party. In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including Éric Besson, who served as Ségolène Royal&#x27;s economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister Rachida Dati, is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, two attended the elite École nationale d&#x27;administration (ENA). The ministers were reorganised, with the controversial creation of a &#x27;Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development&#x27;—given to his right-hand man Brice Hortefeux—and of a &#x27;Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration&#x27;—handed out to Éric Wœrth, supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire. However, after 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet was adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials.

Sarkozy broke with the custom of amnestying traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on Bastille Day, a tradition that Napoleon had started in 1802 to commemorate the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution.

In 2007 and 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Quebec Premier Jean Charest all spoke in favour of a Canada – EU free trade agreement. In October 2008, Sarkozy became the first French President to address the National Assembly of Quebec. In his speech he spoke out against Quebec separatism, but recognized Quebec as a nation within Canada. He said that, to France, Canada was a friend, and Quebec was family.

===Release of hostages===
Shortly after taking office, Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president Álvaro Uribe and the left-wing guerrilla FARC, regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC&#x27;s &quot;chancellor&quot; Rodrigo Granda.

Furthermore, he announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya to their country. In exchange, he signed with Muammar Gaddafi security, health care and immigration pacts—and a $230 million (168 million euros) MILAN antitank missile sale. The contract was the first made by Libya since 2004, and was negotiated with MBDA, a subsidiary of EADS. Another 128 million euro contract would have been signed, according to Tripoli, with EADS for a TETRA radio system. The Socialist Party (PS) and the Communist Party (PCF) criticised a &quot;state affair&quot; and a &quot;barter&quot; with a &quot;Rogue state&quot;. The leader of the PS, François Hollande, requested the opening of a parliamentary investigation.

===Green policy===
On 8 June 2007, during the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050 in order to prevent global warming. He then pushed forward Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn as European nominee to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed to nominate Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures.

In 2010, a study of :Yale and Columbia universities ranked France the most respectful country of the G20 concerning the environment.

===Economic policy===
The Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), Sarkozy&#x27;s party, won a majority at the June 2007 legislative election, although by less than expected. In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the &quot;Nouveau Centre&quot;, ratified one of Sarkozy&#x27;s electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the inheritance tax. The inheritance tax formerly provided €8 billion in revenue.

Sarkozy&#x27;s UMP majority prepared a budget that reduced taxes, in particular for upper middle-class people, supposedly in an effort to boost GDP growth, but did not reduce state expenditures. He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so.

On 23 July 2008, parliament voted the &quot;loi de modernisation de l&#x27;économie&quot; (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free.
However, as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Sarkozy returned to the state interventionism of his predecessors, declaring that &quot;laissez-faire capitalism is over&quot; and denouncing the &quot;dictatorship of the market&quot;. Confronted with the suggestion that he had become a socialist, he responded: &quot;Have I become socialist? Perhaps.&quot; He also pledged to create 100,000 state-subsidised jobs.

===Security policy===
Sarkozy&#x27;s government issued a decree on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary biometric profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called &#x27;Parafes&#x27;, was to use fingerprints. The new database would be interconnected with the Schengen Information System (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons (FPR). The Commission nationale de l&#x27;informatique et des libertés (CNIL) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.

===Constitutional reform===
On 21 July 2008, the French parliament passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. The vote was 539 to 357, one vote over the three-fifths majority required; the changes are not yet finalized. They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president&#x27;s right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament to set its own agenda. They would give parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, while ending government control over parliament&#x27;s committee system. He claimed that these reforms strengthen parliament, while some opposition socialist lawmakers described it as a &quot;consolidation of a monocracy&quot;.

===International affairs===

During his 2007 presidential campaign, Sarkozy promised a strengthening of the entente cordiale with the United Kingdom and closer cooperation with the United States.

Sarkozy wielded special international power when France held the rotating EU Council Presidency from July through December 2008. Sarkozy publicly stated his intention to attain EU approval of a progressive energy package before the end of his EU Presidency. This energy package would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy led the EU into a partnership with China. On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of France&#x27;s then presidency of the Council of the EU, met the Dalai Lama in Poland and outraged China, which announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.
On 3 April 2009, at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, Sarkozy announced that France would offer asylum to a former Guantanamo captive.
&quot;We are on the path to failure if we continue to act as we have&quot;, French President Nicolas Sarkozy cautioned at the U.N. Climate Summit on 22 September 2009.

On 5 January 2009, Sarkozy called for a ceasefire plan for the Gaza Strip Conflict. The plan, which was jointly proposed by Sarkozy and Egyptian ex-President Hosni Mubarak, envisioned the continuation of the delivery of aid to Gaza and talks with Israel on border security, a key issue for Israel as it says Hamas smuggles its rockets into Gaza through the Egyptian border. Welcoming the proposal, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for a &quot;ceasefire that can endure and that can bring real security&quot;.

===Military intervention in Libya===

Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s official visit to Nicolas Sarkozy in December 2007 triggered a strong wave of protests against the President in France.

In March 2011, after having been criticized for his unwillingness to support the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and persuaded by the philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy to have France actively engage against the forces of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, Sarkozy was amongst the first Heads of State to demand the resignation of Gaddafi and his government, which was then fighting a civil war in Libya. On 10 March 2011, Sarkozy welcomed to the Elysee Palace three emissaries from the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC), brought to him by Bernard-Henri Levy who mediated at the meeting. Sarkozy promised them a no-fly zone would be imposed on Gaddafi&#x27;s aeroplanes. He also promised them French military assistance. On 17 March 2011, at the behest of France, resolution 1973 was adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, permitting the creation of a &quot;no fly&quot; zone over Libya, and for the undertaking of &quot;necessary measures&quot; for the protection of the country&#x27;s civilian population.

On 19 March 2011, Sarkozy officially announced the beginning of a military intervention in Libya, with France&#x27;s participation. These actions of Sarkozy were favorably received by the majority of the French political class and public opinion.
In 2016, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament published a report stating that the military intervention &quot;was based on erroneous assumptions&quot; that the threat of a massacre of civilian populations has been &quot;overvalued&quot; and that the coalition &quot;Has not verified the real threat to civilians&quot;; He also believes that the true motivations of Nicolas Sarkozy were to serve French interests and to &quot;improve his political situation in France&quot;.

===2012 presidential campaign===
Sarkozy was one of ten candidates who qualified for the first round of voting. François Hollande, the Socialist Party candidate, received the most votes in the first round held on 22 April election, with Sarkozy coming second, meaning that both progressed to the second round of voting on 5–6 May 2012. Sarkozy lost in the runoff and conceded to Hollande. He received an estimated 48.38% compared to Hollande&#x27;s 51.62%.

==Post-presidency==

===Temporary retirement: 2012–2014===
After his defeat at the 2012 election, Sarkozy asked his supporters to respect Hollande&#x27;s victory. He invited his successor to attend his last 8 May Victory in Europe Day commemoration in office. His last day as President of the French Republic was 15 May.

Shortly after, Sarkozy briefly considered a career in private equity and secured a €250 million commitment from the Qatar Investment Authority to back his planned buyout firm. He abandoned his private equity plans when he decided to make a political comeback in 2014.

===Return to politics: 2014–2016===
On 19 September 2014, Sarkozy announced that he was returning to politics and would run for chairman of the UMP party, and was elected to the post on 29 November 2014. Led by Sarkozy, UMP won over two-thirds of the 102 local &quot;départements&quot; in the nationwide elections on 29 March 2015. On 13 December, the Republicans won the majority of regional office races, another set of national elections. (On 30 May the UMP&#x27;s name was changed to the Republicans.)

===2017 retirement from politics===
In January 2016, Sarkozy published the book &quot;La France pour la vie&quot;. In August 2016, he announced his candidacy for 2016 Republican presidential primary in November 2016, but only came in third place behind François Fillon and Alain Juppé. He decided to endorse Fillon and signaled that he was retiring from politics. Being defeated at the Republican presidential primary in 2016, he retired from public life.
In 2020, Sarkozy was charged with corruption by French prosecutors in two cases, notably concerning the alleged Libyan interference in the 2007 French elections. At issue for Sarkozy were campaign costs exceeding the maximum allowed, and how they were paid. In 2021, Sarkozy was convicted of corruption in two separate trials. His first conviction resulted in him receiving a sentence of three years, two of them suspended and one in prison; he has appealed against the ruling. For his second conviction in September 2021, he received a one-year sentence, which he is allowed to serve under home confinement; his lawyer said he would appeal this decision.

He is still a force in conservative politics in France. &quot;Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017, but is still playing a role behind the scenes. French media have reported that he is involved in the process of choosing a conservative candidate ahead of France&#x27;s presidential election next year. But the pair of convictions could force Sarkozy to play a more discreet role in 2022&#x27;s presidential race.&quot; Sarkozy endorsed Emmanuel Macron in the April 2022 election.

In February 2023, Sarkozy together with his wife and daughter visited the Western Wall where they expressed their enthusiasm for the &quot;exciting place&quot; as well as their deep friendship with Israel.

On 12 November 2023, he took part in the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism in Paris in response to the rise in antisemitism since the start of the Israel–Hamas war.

On 18 December 2024, Sarkozy was definitively sentenced to three years in prison, including one to be served under electronic monitoring, for corruption and influence peddling. Despite the ruling, he has decided to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.

==Public image==

Sarkozy was named the 68th best-dressed person in the world by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, alongside David Beckham and Brad Pitt. However, Sarkozy has also been named as the third worst-dressed person in the world by &quot;GQ&quot;.

Beside publicising, at times, and at others, refusing to publicise his ex-wife Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz&#x27;s image, Sarkozy takes care of his own personal image, sometimes to the point of censorship—such as in the &quot;Paris Match&quot; affair, when he allegedly forced its director to resign following an article on his ex-wife and her affair with Publicis executive Richard Attias, or pressures exercised on the &quot;Journal du dimanche&quot;, which was preparing to publish an article concerning Ciganer-Albéniz&#x27;s decision not to vote in the second round of the 2007 presidential election. In its edition of 9 August 2007, &quot;Paris Match&quot; retouched a photo of Sarkozy in order to erase a . His official portrait destined for all French town halls was done by Sipa Press photographer Philippe Warrin, better known for his paparazzi work. Former &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; journalist Colin Randall has highlighted Sarkozy&#x27;s tighter control of his image and frequent interventions in the media: &quot;he censors a book, or fires the chief editor of a weekly&quot;. Sarkozy lost a suit against a manufacturer of Sarkozy voodoo dolls, in which he claimed that he had a right to his own image.
Sarkozy is reported by Reuters to be sensitive about his height; believed to be 165 cm (e.g. 5 ft 5 in). The French media have pointed out that Carla Bruni frequently wears flats when in public with him. In 2009, a worker at a factory where Sarkozy gave a speech said she was asked to stand next to him because she was of a similar height to Sarkozy. (This story was corroborated by some trade union officials.) This was the subject of a political row: the president&#x27;s office called the accusation &quot;completely absurd and grotesque&quot;, while the Socialist Party mocked his fastidious preparation.

Sarkozy was nicknamed as &quot;Hyper-president&quot; or &quot;hyperpresident&quot; by some French media after his 2007 election as president, to describe his desire to control everything. Whereas in the history of the Fifth Republic, the successive presidents were traditionally focused on the foreign policy of the country and on international relations, leaving the Prime Minister and the government to determine the domestic policy, as the Constitution states it, Nicolas Sarkozy appeared to determine both the foreign and domestic policy. Some compared Nicolas Sarkozy to Napoléon Bonaparte and Louis XIV. Indeed, he appointed a very close friend of his, François Fillon, as a Prime Minister. Fillon was accused of being an instrument of the President&#x27;s power.

The biopic &quot;The Conquest&quot; is a 2011 film that dramatizes Sarkozy&#x27;s rise to power, with candid portrayals of Nicolas Sarkozy himself, Chirac and Villepin. It was shown at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

==Controversies==
Sarkozy is generally disliked by the left and has been criticised by some on the right, most vocally by moderate Gaullist supporters of Jacques Chirac and Dominique de Villepin. The communist-leaning magazine &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; accused Sarkozy of populism.

===Views on religions===

In 2004 Sarkozy co-authored a book, &quot;La République, les religions, l&#x27;espérance&quot; (&quot;The Republic, Religions, and Hope&quot;), in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or republican values. He advocated reducing the separation of church and state, arguing for the government subsidies for mosques to encourage Islamic integration into French society. He has opposed financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with Tom Cruise, Sarkozy was criticized by some for meeting with a member of the Church of Scientology, which has been seen by some as a cult. Sarkozy was criticized by some after he claimed &quot;the roots of France are essentially Christian&quot; at a December 2007 speech in Rome. Similarly, he drew criticism after he called Islam &quot;one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known&quot; at a speech in Riyadh in January 2008.

===Controversial statements===
In the midst of a tense period and following the death of an 11-year-old boy, caught in the crossfire of a gang brawl in the Paris suburb of La Courneuve in June 2005, Sarkozy went to the scene and said: &quot;on va nettoyer au Kärcher la cité&quot;&quot; (&quot;we will clean the area with a pressure washer&quot;). Two days before the 2005 Paris riots, he referred to young criminals of nearby housing projects as &quot;&quot; (&quot;thugs&quot;) and &quot;&quot;, a slang term which can be translated into English as &quot;rascals&quot;, &quot;scum&quot; or &quot;riff-raff&quot;, in answer to a resident who addressed Sarkozy with &quot;&quot;Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille?&quot; (&quot;When will you rid us of these ?&quot;&quot;). The French Communist Party publication, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, branded this language as inappropriate. Following Sarkozy&#x27;s use of the word &quot;racaille,&quot; many people in the &quot;banlieues&quot; identified him as a politician of the far right. His period as Minister of the Interior saw the use of police as shock troops in the &quot;banlieues&quot;, and a police &quot;raid&quot; on the suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois in October 2005 led to two boys being electrocuted in a power sub-station. The riots began that night.

In September 2005 Sarkozy was accused of pushing for a hasty inquiry into an arson attack on a police station in Pau, of which the alleged perpetrators were acquitted for lack of proof. On 22 June 2005 Sarkozy told law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of &quot;the judge&quot; who had freed a man on parole who had later committed a murder.

A few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy had an interview with philosopher Michel Onfray. Sarkozy stated that disorders such as paedophilia and depression have a genetic as well as social basis, saying &quot;... I&#x27;d be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease&quot;; he claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to give parents a complex. It&#x27;s not exclusively the parents&#x27; fault every time a youngster commits suicide.&quot; These statements were criticised by some scientists, including geneticist Axel Kahn. Sarkozy later added, &quot;What part is innate and what part is acquired? At least let&#x27;s debate it, let&#x27;s not close the door to all debate.&quot;

On 27 July 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech in Dakar, Senegal, written by Henri Guaino, in which he claimed that &quot;the African has never really entered into history&quot;. The controversial remarks were widely condemned by Africans, with some viewing them as racist. South African president Thabo Mbeki praised Sarkozy&#x27;s speech, which raised criticism by some in the South African media.

On 30 July 2010, Sarkozy suggested a new policy of security, and he proposed &quot;stripping foreign-born French citizens who opted to acquire their nationality at their majority of their citizenship if they are convicted of threatening the life of a police officer or other serious crimes&quot;. This policy has been criticized for example by the US newspaper &quot;The New York Times&quot;, by Sarkozy&#x27;s political opponents, including the Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry, and by experts of French law, including the ex-member of the Constitutional Council of France, Robert Badinter, who said that such action would be unconstitutional.

He called for coercive methods to promote &quot;métissage,&quot; a melting pot society, which he called an &quot;obligation&quot; during a press conference on 17 December 2008.

===&quot;Casse-toi, pauv&#x27;con&quot;===

On 23 February 2008, Sarkozy was filmed by a reporter for French newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot; having the following exchange while visiting the Paris International Agricultural Show:While quickly crossing the hall Saturday morning, in the middle of the crowd, Sarkozy encounters a recalcitrant visitor who refuses to shake his hand. &quot;Ah no, don&#x27;t touch me!&quot;, said the man. The president retorted immediately: &quot;Get lost, then.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re making me dirty&quot;, yelled the man. With a frozen smile, Sarkozy says, his teeth glistening, a refined &quot;Get lost, then, poor dumb-ass, go.&quot; A precise translation into English has many possible variations.

On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from Laval came to an anti-Sarkozy demonstration with a sign bearing the words &quot;Casse-toi pov&#x27; con&quot;, the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of €1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic €30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, as president of the Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon&#x27;s rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.

===Position on the Iraq war===
Sarkozy opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. However, he was critical of the way Chirac and his foreign minister Dominique de Villepin expressed France&#x27;s opposition to the war. Talking at the French-American Foundation in Washington, D.C., on 12 September 2006, he denounced what he called the &quot;French arrogance&quot; and said: &quot;It is bad manners to embarrass one&#x27;s allies or sound like one is taking delight in their troubles.&quot; He added: &quot;We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis.&quot; Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy&#x27;s speech was &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;a shameful act&quot;.

===Accusations of nepotism===
In October 2009, Sarkozy was accused of nepotism for helping his son, Jean, try to become head of the public body running France&#x27;s biggest business district EPAD. On 3 July 2012, French police raided Sarkozy&#x27;s residence and office as part of a probe into claims that Sarkozy was involved in illegal political campaign financing.

===Political and financial scandals and criminal convictions===
On 5 July 2010, following its investigations on the Bettencourt affair, online newspaper Mediapart ran an article in which Claire Thibout, a former accountant of billionairess Liliane Bettencourt, accused Sarkozy and Eric Woerth of receiving illegal campaign donations in 2007, in cash. 

On 1 July 2014 Sarkozy was detained for questioning by police over claims he had promised a prestigious role in Monaco to a high-ranking judge, Gilbert Azibert, in exchange for information about the investigation into alleged illegal campaign funding. Mr Azibert, one of the most senior judges at the Court of Appeal, was called in for questioning on 30 June 2014. It is believed to be the first time a former French president has been held in police custody, although his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust while he was mayor of Paris and given a suspended prison sentence in 2011. After 15 hours in police custody, Sarkozy was put under official investigation for &quot;active corruption&quot;, &quot;misuse of influence&quot; and &quot;obtained through a breach of professional secrecy&quot; on 2 July 2014. Mr Azibert and Sarkozy&#x27;s lawyer, Thierry Herzog, are also now under official investigation. The two accusations carry sentences of up to 10 years in prison. The developments were seen as a blow to Sarkozy&#x27;s attempts to challenge for the presidency in 2017. Nevertheless, he later stood as a candidate for the Republican party nomination, but was eliminated from the contest in November 2016. A trial on this case, Sarkozy&#x27;s first, started on 23 November 2020.

On 16 February 2016, Sarkozy was indicted on &quot;illegal financing of political campaign&quot; charges related to overspending in his 2012 presidential campaign and retained as witness in connection with the Bygmalion scandal.

In April 2016, Arnaud Claude, former law partner of Sarkozy, was named in the Panama Papers.

On 23 November 2020, the trial of Nicolas Sarkozy started who is accused of corruption and influence peddling, for an attempted bribery of a judge. The trial was postponed until November 26, following a request from one of his co-defendants for health reasons.
On 1 March 2021, a court in Paris found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of corruption, trading in influence in a wiretapping and illegal data exchange case involving a number of individuals like magistrate Gilbert Azibert and Sarkozy&#x27;s former lawyer Thierry Herzog. Both men were tried with him and convicted as well. Sarkozy and his two co-defendants were sentenced to three years, two of them suspended, and one in prison. Sarkozy appealed the ruling, which suspends its application.

On 20 May 2021, a second criminal trial, this time pertaining to the Bygmalion Scandal related to illegal campaign funding, began for Sarkozy, as well as 13 other defendants who were said to have been involved in the Bygmalion scandal. Sarkozy&#x27;s second corruption trial involved allegations of diverting tens of millions of euros which was intended to be spent on his failed 2012 re-election campaign and then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. The illicit campaign finance money was instead used to overspend on lavish campaign rallies and events.

On 30 September 2021, Sarkozy was convicted along with his co-defendants. For this conviction, Sarkozy was given a one-year prison sentence, though he was also given the option to serve this sentence at home with an electronic bracelet. On December 18, 2024, the Court of Cassation rejected Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s appeal in cassation and the co-defendants, thus making Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s conviction final, who immediately announced that they would refer the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.

In 2023, Sarkozy&#x27;s attempt to appeal the decision was denied and he has been banned from holding public office for three years and but will still have the option of serving his sentence from home with an electronic bracelet.

In February 2024, an appeals court in Paris upheld a lower court decision requiring Sarkozy to serve his sentence for the campaign overspending conviction. However, the one-year sentence was revised so he would instead serve six months of it in prison and six months of it suspended.

===Alleged Libyan agent of influence===

Shortly after his inauguration as President of France in 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy invited Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to France over the objections of both the political opposition, and members of his own government. The visit marked the first time Gaddafi had been to France in more than 35 years and, during it, France agreed to sell Libya 21 Airbus aircraft and signed a nuclear cooperation agreement. Negotiations for the purchase of more than a dozen Dassault Rafale fighter jets, plus military helicopters, were also initiated during the trip.

During the 2011 Libyan Civil War – a conflict in which France intervened – Saif-al-Islam Gaddafi said in an interview with euronews that the Libyan state had donated €50 million to Sarkozy&#x27;s 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for access and favors by Sarkozy.

Investigative website Mediapart subsequently published several documents appearing to prove a payment of €50 million, and also published a claim by Ziad Takieddine (disclaimer by the same person in another video) that he had personally handed three briefcases stuffed with cash to Sarkozy. French magistrates later acquired diaries of former Libyan oil minister Shukri Ghanem in which payments to Sarkozy were mentioned. Shortly thereafter, however, Ghanem was found dead, floating in the Danube in Austria and thereby preventing his corroboration of the diaries.

In January 2018, British police arrested Alexandre Djouhri on a European Arrest Warrant. Djouhri was an associate of Sarkozy and had refused to respond to a French judicial summons for questioning over allegations he had helped launder Libyan funds on behalf of Sarkozy.

===Ukraine===
In an interview with in August 2023, Sarkozy said that Ukraine should remain &quot;neutral&quot; and not join NATO or the EU; that France and Russia &quot;need each other&quot;; and that Macron should &quot;renew dialogue&quot; with Putin. In the same interview, Sarkozy called for Ukraine to accept the Russian occupation of Crimea as well as other contested territory, describing the return of Crimea to Ukraine as &quot;illusory&quot;.

He condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine but insisted that &quot;Russia will remain our neighbour whether we like it or not. We must find ways and means to re-establish neighbourly, or at least calmer, relations&quot; and &quot;take into account Russia&#x27;s historic fear of being encircled by unfriendly neighbours.&quot; Critics have reproved his comments as &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot;, and others have accused Sarkozy of being a &quot;Kremlin influencer&quot;. Sarkozy has also received support from others for his position, arguing that it presents a &quot;diplomatic way out&quot; of the war.

<text>Dig Your Own Hole is the second studio album by the English electronic music duo the Chemical Brothers. It was released on 7 April 1997 in the United Kingdom by Freestyle Dust and Virgin Records and in the United States by Astralwerks. It was recorded between 1996 and 1997, and features Noel Gallagher of Oasis and Beth Orton as guest vocalists.

&quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; was the first Chemical Brothers album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Five singles were released, two of which reached number one in the UK: &quot;Setting Sun&quot;, &quot;Where Do I Begin&quot;, &quot;Block Rockin&#x27; Beats&quot;, &quot;Elektrobank&quot;, and &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot;. The album has been included in several British magazines&#x27; lists of the best albums ever. The success of the album led the Chemical Brothers to be much sought-after remixers, and they released a mix album in 1998, &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot;.

== Background ==
After the Chemical Brothers&#x27; successful debut album, &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;, released in June 1995, the duo continued to tour but quickly sought to record new material. Following the release of &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;, the final single from that album, the duo had changed labels from Junior Boy&#x27;s Own to Virgin, with Virgin getting credit on their album &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; as well under the liner notes. The duo released an EP, &quot;Loops of Fury&quot; in January 1996, consisting of new material and a remix of one of the band&#x27;s earliest and signature tracks, &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;.

The songs &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Rock&quot; were released in June 1996 on vinyl as &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 1&quot; and &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 2&quot; respectively as promos for DJs to test in clubs. The duo met up with Noel Gallagher. They were interested in collaborating for a track. The Chemical Brothers had reportedly given him an instrumental track and he then wrote lyrics for the track. The song was released as the single &quot;Setting Sun&quot; on 30 September 1996. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number one. Stereogum said that &quot;the combination of rave sirens and psych-rock far-outness [on &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;] was probably what convinced people like Noel Gallagher and Mercury Rev to jump onboard&quot;.

&quot;Where Do I Begin&quot; was released as a promotional single in early 1997. &quot;Block Rockin&#x27; Beats&quot; was released on 24 March 1997 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the duo&#x27;s second number one single.

== Release ==
&quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; was released on 7 April 1997 by record labels Virgin and Freestyle Dust.

&quot;Elektrobank&quot; was released on 8 September 1997 and reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot; was released on 1 December 1997. A numbered release, it was ineligible for the UK Singles Charts. Further physically released promotion for the album include a DJ mix and interview set.
The album was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 21 January 2000. In 2004, the album was packaged with 1995&#x27;s &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; in a limited edition box set as part of EMI&#x27;s &quot;2CD Originals&quot; collection.

&quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.

== Critical reception and legacy ==
In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke wrote that &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; &quot;burns the whole rock vs. techno argument into a fine, white ash&quot;, calling it &quot;a wild beauty of a record&quot; that &quot;rocks, rolls and surges without factionalist prejudice or fear of genre.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne found that the Chemical Brothers manage to turn sounds and &quot;recycled voice snippets&quot; into &quot;alluring hooks in and of themselves, bringing the record as close to pop as techno has come so far&quot;, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau attributed the album&#x27;s effectiveness to the duo&#x27;s &quot;spirit—generous, jubilant, unfazed by industrial doom, in love with energy and sound.&quot;

In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; readers voted &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; the 49th greatest album of all time, and was also included in Q TV&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Albums of All Time&quot; list in 2008. In 2000, the same magazine placed it at number 42 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 414 in its 2014 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Nineties&quot;, as did &quot;Spin&quot;.

<text>Frank Joseph Zamboni Jr. (, ; January 16, 1901 – July 27, 1988) was an American businessman and inventor whose most famous invention is the modern ice resurfacer, with his surname being registered as a trademark for these devices.

==Biography==
Zamboni was born in 1901 in Eureka, Utah, to Italian immigrants. His parents soon bought a farm in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho near Pocatello, Idaho, where he grew up. In 1920, he moved with his parents to the harbor district of Los Angeles, where his older brother George was operating an auto repair shop. After Frank attended a trade school in Chicago, he and his younger brother Lawrence opened an electrical supply business in 1922 in the Los Angeles suburb of Hynes (now part of Paramount). The following year he married and eventually had three children, a son and two daughters. In 1927, he and Lawrence added an ice-making plant and entered the block ice business. They continued their ice business in 1939, but saw little future in that business with the advent of electrically operated refrigeration units. They decided to use their excess refrigeration equipment to open an ice rink nearby.

In 1940, the brothers, along with a cousin, Pete Zamboni, opened the Iceland rink, which proved very popular, in no small part because Frank had devised a way to eliminate rippling caused by the pipes that were laid down to keep the rink frozen. He obtained a patent for that innovation in 1946. Then, in 1949, he invented a machine that transformed the job of resurfacing an ice rink from a five-man, 90-minute task to a one-man, 15-minute job. The initial machine included a hydraulic cylinder from an A-20 attack plane, a chassis from an oil derrick, a Jeep engine, a wooden bin to catch the shavings, and a series of pulleys. His son, Richard, said, &quot;It took him nine years. One of the reasons he stuck with it was that everyone told him he was crazy.&quot; Zamboni did not expect to make more but, after seeing the machine, Sonja Henie immediately ordered two, and then the Chicago Blackhawks placed an order. Zamboni applied for a patent in 1949, obtained it in 1953, and set up Frank J. Zamboni &amp; Co. in Paramount to build and sell the machines.

The machine shaves ice off the surface, collects the shavings, washes the ice, and spreads a thin coat of fresh water onto the surface. In the early 1950s, Zamboni built them on top of Jeep CJ-3Bs, then on stripped Jeep chassis from 1956 through 1964. Demand for the machine proved great enough that his company added a second plant in Brantford, Ontario and a branch office in Switzerland. Though the term &quot;Zamboni&quot; was (and remains) trademarked by his company, the name is sometimes generically used for any brand of ice resurfacing machine.
In the 1970s, he invented machines to remove water from outdoor artificial turf surfaces, remove paint stripes from the same surfaces, and roll up and lay down artificial turf in domed stadiums. His final invention, in 1983, was an automatic edger to remove ice buildup from the edges of rinks.

And yet, according to one recent report, Zamboni “didn’t even like to skate.

He died of cardiac arrest at Long Beach Memorial Hospital in July 1988 at the age of 87, about two months after his wife&#x27;s death. He also had lung cancer. The Zamboni company has sold more than 10,000 units of its signature machine, the Zamboni Ice Resurfacer, commonly known as a &quot;Zamboni.&quot; The 10,000th machine was delivered to the Montreal Canadiens in April 2012 for use at the Bell Centre. The company is still owned and operated by the Zamboni family. His remains are buried at All Souls Cemetery in Long Beach.

Zamboni was inducted into the Ice Skating Institute&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1965, and he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Clarkson University in 1988. Frank was posthumously inducted into the NEISMA Hall of Fame in 1988, the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2000, the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2006, the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007, the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, and into the United States Speed Skating Hall of Fame in 2013.

The Frank J. Zamboni School, in Paramount, is named after him.

<text>Franciszek Ksawery Mikołaj Zabłocki (2 January 1754, Volhynia – 10 September 1821, Końskowola), is considered the most distinguished Polish comic dramatist and satirist of the Enlightenment period. He descends from an old aristocratic family of Poland with coat of arms Łada. He translated many French comedies, among others those by Molière, but also wrote his own plays concentrating on Polish issues.

From 1774, he worked in the Commission for National Education and in 1794, he took part in the Kościuszko Uprising. During the next year he gave up literature and became a priest.

==Literary career==
Zabłocki&#x27;s literary career began with the publication of his work in the Polish literary magazine &quot;&quot; (&quot;Pleasant and Useful Amusements&quot;). The magazine was the first of its kind in Poland, and was launched in the year 1770.

During King Stanislaw August&#x27;s reign, Warsaw was the scene of great literary activity. The King used to host literary figures for dinner every Thursday. Zablocki was a regular invitee to these parties, which included in its guest list such Polish luminaries as Adam Naruszewicz and Ignacy Krasicki. During one such meeting, Zabłocki was asked to read his first comedy &quot;Fri Zabobonnik&quot;. The King was so enraptured by this song that he bestowed the on Zabłocki.

After that Zablocki turned to writing plays, producing an astounding 40 plays in ten years. He mostly wrote comedies. His major works are &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1783), &quot;Sarmatism&quot; (1785), &quot;Muhammad Harlequin&quot; (1785), &quot;King of Bliss in the Country&quot; (1787), &quot;Yellow Nightcap&quot; (1783), &quot;Doctor of Lublin&quot; (1781), &quot;Gamrat&quot; (1785), and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1786).

<doc id="557019" wikidata="Q6025392" url="?curid=557019" title="Indlamu (dance)">
<text>Indlamu (, Afrikaans: Zoeloedans) is a traditional Zulu dance from Southern Africa, synonymous with the Zulu tribe of South Africa and the Northern Ndebele tribe of Western Zimbabwe. The dance is characterised by the dancer lifting one foot over his/her head and bringing it down sharply, landing squarely on the downbeat. Typically, two dancers in warrior&#x27;s pelts perform indlamu routines together, shadowing each other&#x27;s moves perfectly. Historically, it was performed on numerous occasions, especially when warriors prepared for war or when a harvest was celebrated.

<doc id="557020" wikidata="Q1344586" url="?curid=557020" title="Lodovico Zacconi">
<text>Lodovico (or Ludovico) Zacconi (11 June 1555 – 23 March 1627) was an Italian composer and musical theorist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He worked as a singer, theologian, and writer on music in northern Italy and Austria; for a time he was in the employ of Archduke Karl of Graz, and worked in Graz and Vienna.

==Biography==
Born in Pesaro, in the Marche, Zacconi became an Augustinian friar at Venice, where he was ordained priest. In 1577 he was in Venice studying at the church of San Stefano, and at some point in the following six years he was accepted by Andrea Gabrieli as a student of counterpoint. In 1584 he auditioned at San Marco as a singer, and was accepted; however he seems to have declined the position. Also at this time he met Zarlino, the prominent Venetian School theorist; he was to mention the meeting in the second part of his &quot;Prattica di musica&quot; (1622). On 20 July 1585, he joined the musical establishment of Archduke Karl of Graz, a position he retained until Karl&#x27;s death in 1590. Subsequently, he joined the chapel of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, which was directed by Orlande de Lassus.

In 1596 he left the employ of Wilhelm, returning to Italy; in the following years he worked as a prior at Pesaro, and as a preacher and administrator in both Italy and Crete. He retired to Pesaro in 1612, where he remained until his death (at Fiorenzuola di Focara, near Pesaro).

==Works==
Zacconi&#x27;s fame rests on his great work &quot;Prattica di Musica&quot;, first published in 1592 at Venice, of which a second volume appeared in 1619 (or, according to other sources, 1622).

His theoretical works are conservative, and make no mention of the emerging Baroque style, in spite of his studies with the distinguished Venetian composer Andrea Gabrieli. His most important works are the two books of &quot;Prattica di musica&quot; (&quot;Musical Practice&quot;) which he published in Venice in 1592 and 1622. These two volumes—containing four works—treat exhaustively of musical theory, and are copiously illustrated. The directions for rendering polyphonic music are of the highest value, especially the Palestrina illustrations. He deals fully with the six Authentic and six Plagal Modes, studiously omitting the Locrian and Hypolocrian Modes. But he also treats of orchestral instruments—their compass and method of playing—and gives valuable information as to the scoring of early operas and oratorios. In fact he covers the whole ground of music, as practised at the close of the 16th century.

Zacconi&#x27;s treatises are an invaluable guide to the study of performance practice of vocal music of the very late Renaissance. Parts of his work were incorporated by Michael Praetorius into his &quot;Syntagma musicum&quot; (1618), and by Pietro Cerone into his &quot;Melopeo y maestro&quot; (1613).

<doc id="557030" wikidata="Q296589" url="?curid=557030" title="Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)">
<text>Daniel Ben Murphy (born 18 March 1977) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Murphy began his career with Crewe Alexandra in 1993 before moving to Liverpool in 1997. With Liverpool, he won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup. After brief spells at Charlton Athletic and Tottenham Hotspur he joined Fulham, which he helped reach the 2010 UEFA Europa League final, and ended his career at Blackburn Rovers. He served as captain at his last two clubs.

Murphy made nine appearances for the England national team from his debut in 2001, scoring once.

==Club career==
===Early life and career===
Daniel Ben Murphy was born on 18 March 1977 in Chester, Cheshire. He started his career as a trainee at Crewe Alexandra. Murphy praised the role of Crewe manager Dario Gradi in his footballing education, considering him as his mentor. In November 2016, as the United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal erupted, Murphy also strongly defended Gradi&#x27;s reputation.

Murphy made his first-team debut for Crewe as a 16-year-old on 7 December 1993, coming on as a substitute in a 3–2 away win over Bradford City in the Football League Trophy. He scored on his home debut, with the winner in a 4–3 home win against Preston North End in the league. Murphy generally played as a deep-lying forward for Crewe, scoring several spectacular long range and set piece goals. While at Gresty Road, Murphy formed a prolific partnership with striker Dele Adebola.

Murphy helped Crewe earn promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time since 1896, as Crewe finished third in the Second Division, before going on to beat Brentford 1–0 at Wembley Stadium in the 1997 play-off final.

===Liverpool===
Murphy signed for Premier League club Liverpool in 1997 for an initial fee of £1.5 million. He made his debut as a substitute on the opening day of the 1997–98 season in a draw with Wimbledon. However, he did not break into the team immediately and, after making just one league appearance for the club during the following season, he returned to Crewe on loan, during which he helped save his old club from relegation. After the loan period ended, he went on to become a regular at Liverpool.

Though naturally a central midfielder, Murphy often played as a wide midfielder due to competition for places, particularly from Steven Gerrard and Dietmar Hamann. Murphy&#x27;s career at Liverpool included a cup treble in 2001 (FA Cup, UEFA Cup and League Cup), a Premier League second-place finish in 2002, and the League Cup in 2003. During the 2001–02 season, when he established himself as a key member of the side, Liverpool&#x27;s assistant manager Phil Thompson praised Murphy, citing his versatility and describing him as &#x27;probably the most tactically aware player that we have.&#x27; Although the 2002–03 season was overall a disappointing one for Liverpool, with the club dropping to fifth in the table, Murphy had a fine individual campaign which saw him score 12 goals and be voted the supporters&#x27; player of the season. He also started the 2003 League Cup final as Liverpool beat Manchester United, having missed the 2001 final due to injury.

He developed a habit of scoring the deciding goal in 1–0 wins away to Manchester United, a feat he achieved three times in four seasons (2000–01, 2001–02 and 2003–04).

===Charlton Athletic===
Murphy signed for Charlton Athletic in August 2004 on a four-year contract for a fee of £2.5 million. In his first season at Charlton, Murphy struggled to recapture the form that he had shown at Liverpool. However, in the first three months of the 2005–06 season he emerged as a viable option for England once more, and also won the Premier League Player of the Month award for September, scoring several goals along the way.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 31 January 2006, Murphy signed for Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £2 million. He appeared only fleetingly in the remaining games of the season.

Murphy scored his first Tottenham goal in a 2–1 win over Portsmouth on 1 October 2006 after only 39 seconds of the game. He was unable to establish himself as a regular at Tottenham, but made clear later that despite reports in the media, there was no disagreement between him and Jol.

===Fulham===
Fulham took over Murphy&#x27;s Tottenham contract on 31 August 2007. He cemented himself as a regular starter, kept his place in the team throughout the season and scored six goals in 43 matches. One goal, a rare header scored on 11 May 2008, gave Fulham a 1–0 win away at Portsmouth and ensured their Premier League survival. Following the match, Murphy highlighted manager Roy Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;key role&quot; in the team&#x27;s avoiding relegation. Murphy signed a new one-year contract, with an option for a further year, at the end of the season, and was appointed club captain for the 2008–09 season.

On 9 November 2008, Murphy scored his 100th goal at club level with a penalty kick, as Fulham beat Newcastle United 2–1. Murphy scored another penalty as, for the first time in 45 years, Fulham beat title-chasing Manchester United at home.

The year&#x27;s option on Murphy&#x27;s contract was taken up during the season, but in August 2009, amid reported interest from clubs including Birmingham City and Stoke City, he signed another extension, until June 2011. Murphy missed two months in the early part of the season with a knee ligament problem, but went on to captain Fulham to their first European final. They eliminated opponents including Juventus, defending champions Shakhtar Donetsk, Bundesliga champions VfL Wolfsburg, and Hamburger SV to reach the 2010 UEFA Europa League final. Ahead of the semi-final, Murphy said that just reaching the final &quot;would be one of the greatest achievements of our history&quot;. Fulham lost 2–1 to Atlético Madrid to a goal scored just four minutes from the end of extra time.

The 2010–11 season started without Hodgson, who left for Liverpool, and was replaced by Mark Hughes. In October, Murphy made a controversial comment about managers responsible for dangerous tackles made by players. His comment was supported by some, but received heavy criticisms from other managers. In response to these criticisms, Murphy said his comments &quot;were blown out of all proportion&quot;. In late-January 2011, Murphy signed another contract extension to keep him as Fulham until June 2012. Just one day after signing a new contract, Murphy scored his first goal of the season and then another, as Fulham beat his former club Tottenham 4–0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Murphy was praised by Manager Mark Hughes for helping the club turn things around and avoid relegation.
Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Murphy believed he could play a major role and declared himself &quot;fitter than ever&quot;. After making forty-nine appearances and scoring seven times in all competitions, he was released by Fulham at the end of the season as he and Martin Jol, who had replaced Hodgson&#x27;s successor, Hughes, could not agree on a contract extension. In his last season at Fulham, Murphy created more goalscoring chances than any other player in the top-flight.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 25 June 2012, Murphy signed for Championship club Blackburn Rovers on a two-year contract. He said that he moved to Blackburn to play regularly and that it was the right time to leave Fulham. He scored his first goal for Blackburn in a 2–2 draw with Huddersfield Town on 6 November 2012. In March 2013, Murphy was succeeded as Blackburn captain by Scott Dann. On 1 July, Murphy had his contract terminated by mutual consent despite being willing to stay at the club for another season. While at the club, Murphy was praised by manager Gary Bowyer for his assistance during Bowyer&#x27;s management career at Blackburn.

==International career==
Murphy scored on his debut for the England national under-18 team on 24 July 1994, in a 3–3 draw away to Norway in a friendly, which he entered as a substitute. He made his first start two days later in a 3–2 home win over the same opposition in another friendly. He finished his under-18 career with seven appearances and five goals from 1994 to 1995.

Murphy was part of the England under-20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia, and made his debut at that level when starting England&#x27;s first match at the tournament, a 2–1 win over the Ivory Coast on 18 June 1997. He scored a hat-trick two days later in England&#x27;s next match, a 5–0 win over the United Arab Emirates. All four of Murphy&#x27;s appearances for the under-20s came at this tournament, in which England were eliminated on 26 June after losing 2–1 to Argentina in the round of 16.

Murphy made his debut for the England under-21 team on 9 September 1997 with a start in a 1–0 home win over Moldova in 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification. He was in the squad for the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Slovakia, playing in all three of England&#x27;s matches as they were eliminated in the group stage. He made five appearances for the under-21s from 1997 to 2000.

Murphy played nine times for the England senior team and scored one goal between 2001 and 2003. He made his debut on 10 November 2001 as a 58th-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw at home to Sweden in a friendly. He scored his only goal on 17 April 2002 in a 4–0 home victory over Paraguay in a friendly with a deflected shot. Murphy was called up to England&#x27;s squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan as a replacement for the injured Steven Gerrard, but had to withdraw after he suffered a foot injury.

==Post-playing career==
On 18 August 2013, Murphy appeared as a pundit on the BBC programme &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. He announced his retirement as a player on 10 October, with the intention of continuing his media work and completing his coaching badges. He established a career as a pundit on the UK radio station Talksport.

==Personal life==
Murphy is the nephew of former footballers Paul Futcher, Graham Futcher and Ron Futcher, and is the cousin of Ben Futcher. Murphy married actress Joanna Taylor in 2004. They have two children. The couple separated in 2017.

In 2024, Murphy revealed that after his football career had ended he had struggled with no longer having football in his life and had turned to cocaine and cannabis to help him cope, at one point becoming addicted to cocaine.

<doc id="557033" wikidata="Q313137" url="?curid=557033" title="Stéphane Henchoz">
<text>Stéphane Henchoz (; born 7 September 1974) is a Swiss football coach and a former professional player who played as a centre-back, most notably for the English club Liverpool. He was capped 72 times and played for the Switzerland national team from his debut in 1993, and played at Euro 1996 and Euro 2004.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Billens, Switzerland, Henchoz first came to notice playing in the German Bundesliga for Hamburger SV.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In June 1997, he turned down an opportunity to join Manchester United, instead signing for Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £3 million. Henchoz enjoyed a very successful debut Premiership season as Rovers finished sixth in 1997–98, although they were then relegated at the end of the 1998–99 season. Henchoz, however, remained in the Premiership, after being purchased for £3.5 million by Liverpool.

===Liverpool===
At Liverpool, Henchoz became a regular member of the first team during his five-and-a-half-year stay at Anfield. Henchoz proved to be an inspirational signing and was popular with the Liverpool fans. He formed an effective central defensive partnership with Sami Hyypiä. This partnership played an important part in Liverpool&#x27;s historic cup treble in 2001, although it was Henchoz&#x27;s clumsy challenge on Martin O&#x27;Connor in the 90th minute of the League Cup final against Birmingham City that led to extra time (the match itself was only settled on penalties). Henchoz is also remembered for inadvertently blocking a goalbound Thierry Henry shot with his arm in the 17th minute of that year&#x27;s FA Cup final, Liverpool then went on to win the match with two Michael Owen finishes.

His last two seasons were interrupted due to spells of injury, but he still surpassed the 200 mark of games for Liverpool in 2003–04.

With injury problems and Gerard Houllier preferring Igor Bišćan at centre half, Henchoz became something of a bit part player appearing as an occasional right back. Eventually, the Henchoz-Hyypiä partnership was rekindled in 2003–04, helping Liverpool to fourth place in the league.

===Celtic===
When Rafael Benítez replaced Gérard Houllier as manager, his decision to try versatile English defender Jamie Carragher in partnership with Hyypiä spelled an end to Henchoz&#x27;s Anfield career. Carragher, previously employed as a full-back, was a revelation at centre back and Henchoz consequently joined Celtic on a six-month contract in January 2005.

===Wigan Athletic===
Upon the expiration of his Celtic contract, Henchoz opted to move back to the Premier League, signing a one-year contract with newly promoted Wigan Athletic. He made 26 league appearances during the 2005–06 season as the club exceeded expectations with a top half finish. Henchoz also started for Wigan in the 2006 Football League Cup Final.

===Return to Blackburn Rovers===
Henchoz left Wigan after only a year, signing a contract until the end of the 2006–07 season with Blackburn Rovers. He was used sparingly during the season to fill in for injuries, but performed suitably. His second spell at Blackburn came to an end on 19 May, when he was released by Mark Hughes.

Henchoz ended his career on 13 October 2008.

==International career==
Henchoz earned 72 caps for the Switzerland national team from his debut in 1993. He played for the country at Euro 96 and Euro 2004. He was expected to play in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but due to health problems he retired from international football on 31 March 2006.

==Coaching career==

After retiring, Henchoz became manager of Blackburn Rovers&#x27;s U18 team which he was until June 2009. He then became manager of FC Bulle for the 2009–10 season.

In December 2015, he was appointed assistant manager of Neuchâtel Xamax. On 6 February 2019, the club announced, that they had sacked Michel Decastel and Henchoz would take charge of the club for the rest of the season. At the end of March 2019, the club confirmed that Henchoz would leave his position at the end of the season.

On 27 May 2019, Henchoz was appointed manager of Sion for the upcoming 2019–20 season. He resigned on 4 November 2019 following a 3–0 loss to St. Gallen, which was the fifth loss in six league games.

In July 2020, he returned to Neuchâtel Xamax.

<text>Kumari Mayawati (born Kumari Mayawati Das; 15 January 1956) is an Indian politician who served as the 18th Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh from 1995 to 1995, 1997 to 1997, 2002 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2012. She is the national president of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which focuses on a platform of social change for &quot;Bahujans&quot;, more commonly known as Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as religious minorities since 2003.

Mayawati had also served as a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha from 2012 to 2017 from Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati&#x27;s rise from humble beginnings has been called a &quot;miracle of democracy&quot; by P. V. Narasimha Rao, former prime minister of India. In 1993, Kanshi Ram formed a coalition with the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1995. She was the first female Scheduled Caste chief minister in India. In 1997 and in 2002 she was chief minister with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the second time only for a year up to 26 August 2003 due to BJP withdrawing support.

Mayawati&#x27;s tenure has attracted praise and criticism. Millions of Dalits across India popularly view her as an icon, and refer to her as &quot;Behen-ji&quot; (elder sister). She has been praised for her fundraising efforts on behalf of her party and her birthdays have been widely celebrated by her supporters. On the contrary, the rise in her personal wealth and that of her party have been criticised as indicative of corruption.

== Early life and education ==
Mayawati was born as Kumari Mayawati Das on 15 January 1956 at Shrimati Sucheta Kriplani Hospital, New Delhi. Her father Prabhu Das, was a post office employee at Badalpur village, near Dadri in Gautam Buddha Nagar. The sons in the family were sent to private schools, while the daughters went to &quot;low-performing government schools&quot;.

Mayawati studied for her B.A. in 1975 at the Kalindi College, University of Delhi and obtained her LL.B. from the prestigious Faculty of Law, University of Delhi in 1983. She completed a B.Ed. from Meerut University&#x27;s VMLG College, Ghaziabad, in 1976. She was working as a teacher in Inderpuri JJ Colony, Delhi, and studying for the Indian Administrative Services exams, when Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other backward castes politician Kanshi Ram visited her family home in 1977. According to biographer Ajoy Bose, Ram told her: &quot;I can make you such a big leader one day that not one but a whole row of IAS officers will line up for your orders.&quot; Kanshi Ram included her as a member of his team when he founded the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in 1984. Mayawati was first elected to Parliament in 1989.

== Early political career ==

Kanshi Ram founded the BSP in 1984. Influenced by B. R. Ambedkar, the party&#x27;s primary focus is to improve the situation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other disadvantaged groups through policy reform, affirmative action on hiring of members of scheduled castes for government posts, and providing rural development programmes. Reservation in India is a system whereby a percentage of government positions and seats at universities are reserved for persons of backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes. Throughout her political career, Mayawati supported reservation in both government and private sectors for backward classes, with an increase in quotas and inclusion of more communities such as religious minorities and economically weak upper castes. In August 2012 a bill was cleared that starts the process of amending the constitution so that the reservation system can be expanded to promotions in state jobs. Mayawati&#x27;s career has been called a &quot;miracle of democracy&quot; by former Prime Minister of India P. V. Narasimha Rao. Millions of Dalit supporters view her as an icon and refer to her as &quot;Behen-ji&quot; (sister). Her public meetings have been attended by large audiences, who use slogans such as &quot;Kanshi Ram ka mission Adhoora; karegi Behen Mayawati poora&quot; (Kanshi Ram&#x27;s unfulfilled mission will be completed by Mayawati) and &quot;Behenji tum sangharsh karo; hum tumhare saath hain&quot; (Sister, go ahead with your struggle; we are with you).

In its first election campaign in 1984, BSP fielded Mayawati for the Lok Sabha (Lower House) seat of Kairana in the Muzaffarnagar district, for Bijnor in 1985, and for Haridwar in 1987. In 1989 she was elected as the representative for Bijnor, with 183,189 votes, winning by 8,879 votes. Although BSP did not win control of the house, the electoral experience led to considerable activity for Mayawati over the next five years, as she worked with Mahsood Ahmed and other organisers. The party won three seats in the 1989 national election and two seats 1991.

Mayawati was first elected to the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 1994. In 1995 she became, as head of her party, Chief Minister in a short-lived coalition government, the youngest Chief Minister in the history of the state up until that point, and the first female Dalit Chief Minister in India. She won election to the Lok Sabha in two different constituencies in 1996 and chose to serve for Harora. She became Chief Minister again for a short period in 1997 and then from 2002 to 2003 in coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2001 Ram named her as his successor to the party leadership.

On 15 December 2001, in an address during a rally Lucknow, Kanshi Ram named Mayawati as his successor. She was elected national president of the BSP for her first term on 18 September 2003. She was elected unopposed for a second consecutive term on 27 August 2006.

== Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh ==
As the Chief Minister, Mayawati gained a reputation for efficient governance and promoting law and order, winning praise even from opposition parties&lt;ref name=&quot;http://aninews.in 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and other rivals. In 2007, MP Umakant Yadav of her own political party, accused in a land grabbing case, was arrested near her dwelling on her orders. During September–October 2010, at the time of the Ayodhya verdict, her government maintained law and order and the state remained peaceful. Several high-profile criminals and mafia dons were jailed during her terms in office. She called for strong anti-rape laws. Fewer riots, lowest rapes, and least corruption occurred during her tenure as compared to previous or successive governments. In the 2007-2012 assembly, only 124 MLAs were s as compared to 271 crorepatis in successive assembly elected in 2012. Uttar Pradesh achieved higher GDP growth rate at 17 per cent and lesser crimes under Mayawati regime as compared to previous and successive governments.

=== First term, 1995 ===
Mayawati first served as Chief Minister from 3 June 1995 to 18 October 1995 with support of BJP. During this term, the new districts of Ambedkar Nagar district and Udham Singh Nagar district were created.

=== Second term, 1997 ===
Her second term was from 21 March 1997 to 20 September 1997. A drive under her government allotted &quot;pattas&quot; or gram sabha lands on lease to thousands of landless residents. In April 1997, she created Gautam Budh Nagar district from the district of Ghaziabad, Kaushambi district was separated from Allahabad district, and Jyotiba Phule Nagar district (now called Amroha district) from Moradabad district. In May 1997, Mahamaya Nagar district (now called Hathras district) was created out of Aligarh district and Banda district was split into Banda and Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Nagar. Mayawati carried out review meetings with bureaucrats and suspended 127 officers. She set up the Dr Ambedkar Awards and erected over 100 statues of various sizes of Ambedkar in Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad and other key towns.

Her third term was from 3 May 2002 to 26 August 2003, in which she had the support of BJP. She suspended 12 IAS officers, including Divisional Commissioners and District Magistrates. Six IPS officers were suspended for failing to maintain law and order, while 24 officers were warned to improve. She started 511 acre Gautam Buddha University.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.outlookindia.com/ 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She renamed King George&#x27;s Medical University to Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University. She suspended three senior officials after review in a couple of administrative divisions.

=== Fourth term, 2007–12 ===
Uttar Pradesh, India&#x27;s most populous state and one of its poorest, is considered pivotal in the politics of India because of its large number of voters. BSP won a majority in the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, due to support of Brahmans. The campaign was accompanied by a colourful slogan: &quot;Haathi nahin, Ganesh hain, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh Hain&quot;: &quot;The elephant (the BSP logo) is really the Lord Ganesha, the trinity of gods rolled into one&quot;. 37 per cent Brahmins voted for the party.

Mayawati was sworn in as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh for the fourth time on 13 May 2007. She announced an agenda that focused on providing social justice to the weaker sections of society and providing employment instead of distributing money to the unemployed. Her slogan was to make &quot;Uttar Pradesh&quot; (&quot;Northern Province&quot;) into &quot;Uttam Pradesh&quot; (&quot;Excellent Province&quot;). Her government began a major crackdown on irregularities in the recruitment process of police officers recruited during the previous Mulayam Singh government. Over 18,000 policemen lost their jobs for irregularities in their hiring, and 25 Indian Police Service officers were suspended for their involvement in corruption while recruiting the constables. Mayawati instituted reforms to introduce transparency into the recruiting process, including posting the results of selection exams online.

On 10 August 2007, the Mayawati government proposed 30 per cent reservation in jobs in the private sector. A quota for promotions was also introduced, but was later quashed by the Supreme Court of India. In September 2007, Bhimrao Ambedkar Rural Integrated Development Programme was started. The Dr Ambedkar Gram Vikas Yojana scheme was launched for supplying water, electricity, and constructing roads in villages with a Dalit majority. Under this scheme, 24,716 villages received improvements.

In 2008, Mayawati launched, &quot;Manyawar Shri Kanshiram Ji Shahri Garib Awas Yojna&quot;, a scheme for building low-cost housing colonies for urban poor with 90,000 low-cost homes under the first round of construction in different towns and cities across the state while a second and a third round were still underway when government ended in 2012 and next government scrapped the scheme including cutting down electricity of these colonies.

Mayawati government started efforts to set up solar power plants and the first 5 MW solar power plant located in Naini of Allahabad district started functioning in March 2012 and was developed by EMC Limited. UP government signed a MoU with NTPC Limited for 1,320-MW power plant. Mayawati&#x27;s dream project of 165 km six lane Yamuna Expressway connected Delhi to Agra through Noida–Greater Noida Expressway, touching 1,182 villages in the state. Later, Indian Air Force fighter jet Dassault Mirage 2000 test-Landed on Yamuna Expressway as Part of Trials. On 15 January 2008, Mayawati inaugurated the construction of the 1,047 km Ganga Expressway at the cost of for joining Ballia to Greater Noida. In 2008, her government established Dr. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University for the Physically challenged students. In November 2009, Mayawati dedicated Noida Metro constructed at the cost of . She had vigorously proposed for construction of Jewar airport near Noida. In October 2011, Mayawati government under public-private partnership with Jaypee Group successfully executed and delivered First F1 Indian Grand Prix, an international event at Buddh International Circuit, Greater Noida constructed by Jaypee Group. The event was hailed as flawlessly conducted salvaging some of India&#x27;s prestige when compared to minor embarrassments in 2010 Commonwealth Games (Before opening ceremony) conducted in Delhi. Mayawati presented the winning trophy to winner Sebastian Vettel. Foreigners found the track as &#x27;impressive&#x27; and 3 Indian teenagers picked by a F1 panel to train them as future Formula One drivers in Europe.

Mayawati has seen through to completion of several memorials dedicated to icons of Bahujan Samaj build first time in India, including the Manyawar Shri Kanshiram Ji Green Eco Garden (inaugurated March 2011), the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal and Green Garden (inaugurated October 2011), and the Ambedkar Memorial Park (opened November 2012). She renamed Amethi district as Chattrapati Sahuji Maharaj Nagar, Kanpur Dehat as Rambai Nagar, Sambhal as Bheem Nagar, Shamli as Prabuddha Nagar, Hapur as Panchsheel Nagar, Kasganj as Kanshiram Nagar, Hathras as Mahamaya Nagar and Amroha as JP Nagar.

Mayawati during her tenure directed all the Commissioners and the District Magistrates to distribute 3 acre land pieces or pattas to weaker sections of society by launching special drive for illegal possesses of pattas be dispossessed of them and the eligible poor be identified by regular monitoring of pattas and strict action against the mafias and musclemen through spot verification of different development and public welfare programmes. In 2010, 5596 people belonging to the SC and ST communities were allotted 1054.879 hectares of agriculture land. In a special drive 74 FIRs were filed and 88 people were arrested for illegal occupation from agricultural land. &quot;Sugar Information Service&quot; a model website supported by SMS and IVRS facility was developed. Mayawati dedicated the 286-bed super-specialty Centenary hospital in Lucknow and 50-bed critical care unit at CSMMU and increased salaries of doctors. Mayawati, in 2007, launched Manyawar Kanshiram Multi-speciality Hospital in Greater Noida which started its OPD services in April 2013. Mayawati government also spent on Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Multi Speciality Hospital in Sector 30 of Noida.

Her government also instituted &quot;Sant Ravidas Kala Samman Award&quot; with a cash prize of . Under &quot;Savitri Bai Phule Balika Shiksha Madad Yojna&quot;, Mayawati distributed over 10 lakh bicycles among Muslim and poor school girls from 2008 to 2011.
After coming to power in 2007, Mayawati wrote letters to the Prime Minister regarding partitioning of Uttar Pradesh into four different states in 2007, in March 2008 and December 2009. Finally on 15 November 2011, Mayawati&#x27;s cabinet approved partitioning Uttar Pradesh into four different states (Pashchim Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh, Bundelkhand and Purvanchal) for better administration and governance.

On 6 March 2012 the Bahujan Samaj Party lost its majority to the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati tendered her resignation to the governor of Uttar Pradesh the next day, thereby becoming the first CM to complete five full years in office. On 13 March 2012 she filed nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha, and she was declared elected unopposed on 22 March.

===Later career===

She was elected as the BSP president for a third term on 30 August 2014 and for fourth term on 28 August 2019.

On 10 December 2023 Mayawati named nephew Akash Anand as her successor.

== Political and legal issues ==
Mayawati&#x27;s political career has attracted praise and controversy. She has been praised for her fundraising efforts on behalf of her party, and her birthdays were major media events as well as a symbol for her supporters. The increase in her personal wealth and that of her party have been viewed by critics as signs of corruption.

=== Taj corridor ===
In 2002, the government of Uttar Pradesh began improvements of the infrastructure in the Taj Heritage Corridor, the important tourist area in Agra that includes the Taj Mahal. The project was soon riddled with problems, including funds being released for the project without the submission of the required detailed project reports to the environmental authorities. Suspecting there were financial irregularities as well, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided twelve residences, including Mayawati&#x27;s. It had filed a First Information Report against her and seven others two days earlier. The raid uncovered evidence of assets disproportionate to her known income. Afterwards, Mayawati resigned from her own government to prove that she was not &quot;hungry for power&quot; She asked the BJP-run Government of India to remove Union Tourism and Culture Minister, Jagmohan for conspiring this all controversy against her.

In June 2007, Governor T. V. Rajeswar said that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute her. In his 23-page order, he said: &quot;the fact that the Mission Management Board, consisting of officers of both the State and the Central Government, regularly met and discussed the project and the fact that even a sum of 17 crores was spent through the Central Government public sector undertaking, NPCC, all go to show that the serious offences with which Mayawati and the Minister were charged do not stand scrutiny.&quot; Advocates unsuccessfully challenged the governor&#x27;s decision in court. The Supreme Court rejected the plea of the CBI and refused to direct the governor to prosecute her. The Taj corridor case was effectively ended before going to trial.

=== Disproportionate assets case ===
In the 2007–08 assessment year, Mayawati paid an income tax of 26 crore, ranking among the top 20 taxpayers in the country. Earlier the CBI filed a case against her for owning assets disproportionate to her known sources of income. Mayawati described the CBI investigation against her as illegal. Her party asserted that her income comes from gifts and small contributions made by party workers and supporters.

On 3 August 2011 the Delhi High court dismissed the central government&#x27;s appeal against Mayawati, stating that &quot;she has fully discharged her obligations by disclosing the identities of all of her donors, the gifts had been donated by her supporters&quot;. The central government decided not to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. On 13 March 2012 Mayawati revealed assets worth 111.26 crore in an affidavit filed with her nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha. The disproportionate assets case was finally quashed on 6 July 2012—nine years later—by a Supreme Court bench of Justice P Sathasivam and Dipak Misra; the court found that the case was unwarranted. Based on an opinion received from the Directorate of Prosecution, the CBI decided not to file an appeal. On 4 October 2012 a review petition was filed by Kamlesh Verma, contending that the case had been dismissed merely on technical grounds, and that the evidence had not been adequately reviewed. On 8 August 2013 the Supreme Court declined a request to re-open the case. After seeking legal advice, the CBI finally closed their file on 8 October 2013.

=== Bahujan monuments ===
In her tenures as a Chief Minister, Mayawati commissioned the production and public display of several monuments having parks, gallerias, museums, memorials, murals and statues representing Buddhist and Hindu, Dalit/OBC icons like Gautama Buddha, Gadge Maharaj, Ravidas, Kabir, Narayana Guru, Jyotirao Phule, Shahu IV, B. R. Ambedkar, BSP party founder Kanshi Ram, and of herself. She claims that the expenditure was required because the past governments did not show respect towards Dalit leaders, in whose memory nothing had ever been built. She spent somewhere between 2,500 and 6,000 crore (about US$500 million to US$1.3 billion) on projects in five parks and at memorials such as the Ambedkar Memorial Park and Manyavar Kanshiram Smarak Sthal, built in the name of B.R. Ambedkar, Ramabai Ambedkar, and Kanshi Ram in Lucknow between 2007 and 2009. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India reported that 66 crore (about US$12 million) in excessive costs had been incurred on the construction of the memorials. In February 2010 Mayawati&#x27;s government approved a plan for a special police force to protect the statues, as she feared that her political opponents might demolish them. In December 2010, her government received permission to continue part of the plan, namely maintenance and completion of Ambedkar Memorial Park.

Despite the existing Supreme Court stay, in October 2011 Mayawati inaugurated the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal and Green Garden, built at a cost of 685 crore. Since the memorial also features her own statues, Mayawati was accused by the Indian National Congress of wasting the taxpayers&#x27; money. The BSP dismissed the allegations, stating that her statues were erected because Kanshi Ram&#x27;s will requested that his statues should be constructed next to those of the current President of BSP. Mayawati accused the Congress of being &quot;anti-Dalit&quot;.

In January 2012, the Election Commission ordered that all of the statues of Mayawati as well as recent statues of elephants (the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party) should be covered up until after February&#x27;s Uttar Pradesh election. On 26 July 2012 the statue in Lucknow was damaged by members of a group calling themselves &quot;Uttar Pradesh Naunirman Sena&quot;. A replacement statue was re-installed overnight by the Lucknow city administration. Following the Lucknow vandalism, there were similar such incidents in other parts of Uttar Pradesh.

=== World Bank criticism ===
The World Bank lent India funds for development, and Mayawati was to manage projects with this money in UP. The projects were preplanned and on schedule, but the Mayawati government made changes which put the projects behind schedule, including rapidly transferring upper caste managers in and out of rural posts. The World Bank sent a letter of complaint on 1 August 2002 to India&#x27;s central government stating, &quot;We have now learnt that project managers have been replaced within three weeks of assuming office. The project coordinator of the Diversified Agriculture Support Project has been changed twice in quick succession and at the moment there is no project coordinator. In the forestry project, numerous changes have been made over past six months ... Such developments do not augur well for these time-bound projects that require consistently good leadership.&quot; Mayawati initially responded by saying the letter was a fake and later said there had been a misunderstanding. She then decreased the number of transfers, stopped creating new posts, and temporarily reduced the level of government spending on furniture and vehicles in response to the allegations. The World Bank continued to criticise the level of corruption even after these measures had been implemented.

== Positions held ==
Kumari Mayawati has been elected three times as Rajya Sabha MP and four times as Lok Sabha MP.

As per the election affidavit of 2012 (Rajya Sabha), Mayawati has assets worth ₹111.64 crores and liabilities worth ₹87.68 lakhs (0.87 crores).

== Personal life and public image ==
Mayawati started her political career after Kanshi Ram, the founder of Bahujan Samaj Party, persuaded her not to join the civil service, but to enter politics. Mayawati chose to remain unmarried. She is also known as &quot;Iron Lady&quot;.

Kanshi Ram praised Mayawati at her 47th birthday celebrations for her fundraising activities on behalf of the party. He stated that the party&#x27;s eventual goal is to gain power at the national level, and that Mayawati&#x27;s efforts had helped in that quest. Her birthdays have since become major media events at which she has appeared laden with diamonds. Her supporters have declared her birthday as &quot;Jan Kalyankari Diwas&quot; (People&#x27;s Welfare Day). In 2009, the day was marked by the announcement of welfare schemes targeted towards poor and downtrodden people of the state and, in 2010, by the launch of social programmes with a value of over 7,312 crore.

In 2007–08, Mayawati paid as income tax. She was at number 20 in the I-T department&#x27;s compilation of the top 200 taxpayers&#x27; list with names like Shah Rukh Khan and Sachin Tendulkar. Mayawati paid in advance tax in April–December 2007. She paid on other incomes, most of which was declared by her as &quot;gifts&quot; by party members.

When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with currency notes on the occasion of the party&#x27;s silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram&#x27;s birth anniversary on 15 March 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on the presumption that the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of currency notes was made from money through corrupt means and not from donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.
At Kanshi Ram&#x27;s funeral ceremonies in 2006, Mayawati stated that both Kanshi Ram and herself had been, and she would continue to be, observant of Buddhist traditions and customs. She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.

== Literature about Mayawati ==
Literature about Mayawati includes studies and books. One of the first works about her was journalist Mohammad Jamil Akhter&#x27;s book, &quot;Iron Lady Kumari Mayawati&quot;. Her autobiographies are &quot;Mere Sangarshmai Jeevan Evam Bahujan Movement Ka Safarnama&quot; in three volumes in Hindi and &quot;A Travelogue of My Struggle-ridden Life and of Bahujan Samaj&quot;, in two volumes in English. &quot;Behenji : A Political Biography of Mayawati&quot; is a biography by veteran journalist Ajoy Bose.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2003, Mayawati as the Chief Minister, was awarded &quot;Paul Harris Fellow Award&quot; by UNICEF, World Health Organization and Rotary International, for her initiative in Polio eradication. Mayawati was also honoured with &quot;Rajarshi Shahu Award&quot; by Rajarshi Shahu Memorial Trust. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; added Mayawati in the 59th place on its list of the 100 most powerful women in the world. She appeared in &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s top woman achievers list in 2007. In 2009 a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article described her as the Barack Obama of India, and a potential candidate for Prime Minister. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Mayawati in India&#x27;s 15 Most Influential list for 2007.

<text>La dolce vita (; Italian for &#x27;the sweet life&#x27; or &#x27;the good life&#x27;) is a 1960 satirical comedy-drama film directed by Federico Fellini and written by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano, Tullio Pinelli, and Brunello Rondi. The film stars Marcello Mastroianni as Marcello Rubini, a tabloid journalist who, over seven days and nights, journeys through the &quot;sweet life&quot; of Rome in a fruitless search for love and happiness. The screenplay can be divided into a prologue, seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an epilogue, according to the most common interpretation.

Released in Italy on 5 February 1960, &quot;La dolce vita&quot; was both a critical success and worldwide commercial hit, despite censorship in some regions. It won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Costumes. It was nominated for three more Oscars, including Best Director for Federico Fellini, and Best Original Screenplay. Its success proved a watershed moment for Italian cinema and European cinema-at-large, and it has come to be regarded as a masterpiece of Italian cinema, as well as one of the greatest films ever made.

In 2008, the film was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage’s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==
===Prologue===
&quot;1st Day Sequence&quot;: A helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman aqueduct outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini&#x27;s news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt. He then shrugs and continues following the statue to Saint Peter&#x27;s Square.

===Episode 1===
&quot;1st Night Sequence&quot;: Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome, while Marcello finds it suits him. They have sex in the bedroom of a prostitute whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena&#x27;s Cadillac.

&quot;1st Dawn Sequence&quot;: Marcello returns to his apartment to find that his fiancée, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena.

===Episode 2===
&quot;2nd Day Sequence&quot;: That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at Ciampino airport where she is met by a horde of news reporters.

During Sylvia&#x27;s press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists&#x27; questions, her boyfriend Robert enters the room late and drunk. Marcello casually recommends to Sylvia&#x27;s producer that she be taken on a tour of St Peter&#x27;s.

Inside St Peter&#x27;s dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is &quot;an elevator&quot; because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking St. Peter&#x27;s Square. They almost share a kiss.

&quot;2nd Night Sequence&quot;: That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the Baths of Caracalla. Sylvia&#x27;s natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fiancé, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome, where they wade into the Trevi Fountain.

&quot;2nd Dawn Sequence&quot;: Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully &quot;anoints&quot; Marcello&#x27;s head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia&#x27;s hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello, who takes it in stride.

===Episode 3===
&quot;3rd Day Sequence&quot;: Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church. Steiner shows off his book of Sanskrit grammar. The two go up to play the organ, offering up a jazz piece for the watching priest before playing Bach.

===Episode 4===
&quot;3rd Day Sequence&quot;: Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the Madonna by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site.

&quot;3rd Night Sequence&quot;: That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Emma prays to the Virgin Mary to be given sole possession of Marcello&#x27;s heart. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna.

&quot;3rd Dawn Sequence&quot;: The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee.

===Episode 3b===
&quot;4th Night Sequence&quot;: One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner&#x27;s luxurious home, where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. The British poet Iris Tree, whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the &quot;prisons&quot; of commitment: &quot;Stay free, available, like me. Never get married. Never choose. Even in love, it&#x27;s better to be chosen.&quot; Emma appears enchanted with Steiner&#x27;s home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner&#x27;s, but he turns away moodily.

Outside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day.

===Intermezzo===
&quot;5th Day Sequence&quot;: Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant, where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing Perez Prado&#x27;s cha-cha “Patricia” on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings.

===Episode 5===
&quot;5th Night Sequence&quot;: Marcello meets his father visiting Rome on the Via Veneto. With Paparazzo, they go to the &quot;Cha-Cha&quot; Club, where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello&#x27;s father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them. Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers&#x27; neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello&#x27;s father has become ill.

&quot;5th Dawn Sequence&quot;: Marcello&#x27;s father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack. Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train to Cesena. He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave.

===Episode 6===
&quot;6th Night Sequence&quot;: Marcello, Nico, and other friends meet on the Via Veneto and are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at Bassano di Sutri outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated. By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an echo chamber. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal. Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, a British artist and heiress.

&quot;6th Dawn Sequence&quot;: Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession.

===Episode 3c===
&quot;7th Night Sequence&quot;: Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma continues an argument by professing her love and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out. Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love. He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses. With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night.

&quot;7th Dawn Sequence&quot;: Emma hears Marcello&#x27;s car returning as she holds wildflowers picked from the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word.

Later, they are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined, when Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners&#x27; apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself. Marcello is interrogated by the police and afterwards volunteers to accompany an officer on his way to meet Steiner&#x27;s wife. 

&quot;8th Day Sequence&quot;: After waiting at the bus stop, Marcello identifies Steiner&#x27;s wife when she arrives. He and the officer escort her to the car to break the terrible news, while the paparazzi swarm around them snapping pictures.

===Episode 7===
&quot;8th Night Sequence&quot;: An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello—now with gray in his hair—has quit journalism and abandoned his attempt at writing a book to become a publicist. He and a group of partygoers break into a Fregene beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello&#x27;s. Many of the men are homosexual. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a striptease to Perez Prado&#x27;s cha-cha “Patricia”. Riccardo shows up at the house and tells the partiers to leave. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem, with Marcello riding a young woman crawling on her hands and knees and throwing pillow feathers around the room.

===Epilogue===
&quot;8th Dawn Sequence&quot;: The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day leviathan, a bloated, sea ray-like creature, caught in the fishermen&#x27;s nets. In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death.

&quot;9th Day Sequence&quot;: Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary, but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crashing waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello and then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.

===Costumes===
In various interviews, Fellini said that the film&#x27;s initial inspiration was the fashionable ladies&#x27; sack dress because of what the dress could hide beneath it. Brunello Rondi, Fellini&#x27;s co-screenwriter and long-time collaborator, confirmed this view explaining that &quot;the fashion of women&#x27;s sack dresses which possessed that sense of luxurious butterflying out around a body that might be physically beautiful but not morally so; these sack dresses struck Fellini because they rendered a woman very gorgeous who could, instead, be a skeleton of squalor and solitude inside.&quot;

===Writing===
Credit for the creation of Steiner, the intellectual who commits suicide after shooting his two children, goes to co-screenwriter Tullio Pinelli. Having gone to school with Italian novelist Cesare Pavese, Pinelli had closely followed the writer&#x27;s career and felt that his over-intellectualism had become emotionally sterile, leading to his suicide in a Turin hotel in 1950. This idea of a &quot;burnt-out existence&quot; is carried over to Steiner in the party episode where the sounds of nature are not to be experienced first-hand by himself and his guests but in the virtual world of tape recordings.

The “false miracle” alludes to the 1958 investigation discounting the claims of two children to have been visited by the Madonna in a farm at Maratta Alta, near Terni. The &quot;dead sea monster&quot; alludes to the Montesi affair, in which the dead body of 21 year old Wilma Montesi was discovered on a beach in April 1953.

=== Casting ===
&quot;La dolce vita&quot; marks the first collaboration between Fellini and Mastroianni. On November 4, 1977 in an interview on The Dick Cavett Show, Mastroianni recalled their first encounter. According to Mastroianni, Fellini told him that the producer wanted Paul Newman for the lead role, but that Fellini considered Newman too beautiful, while Mastroianni was &quot;the face of normal.&quot; Mastroianni, somewhat embarrassed, requested to read the script before agreeing to the role:I said, &quot;Well, ok, I would like to read the script please.&quot; He [Fellini] said, &quot;Why not? Ennio, come with the script&quot;...I opened the script and there was nothing written...blank pages...then I saw a sketch of the sea and a man swimming with an enormous...[Mastroianni indicates a large phallus]...and around his element there was a dance of mermaids. I became green, red, yellow. I said, &quot;Well, it seems very interesting...Where do I sign? And that&#x27;s how I met Fellini.&quot;

===Filming===
Most of the film was shot at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Set designer Piero Gherardi created over eighty locations, including the Via Veneto, the dome of Saint Peter&#x27;s with the staircase leading up to it, and various nightclubs. However, other sequences were shot on location such as the party at the aristocrats&#x27; castle filmed in the real Bassano di Sutri palace north of Rome. (Some of the servants, waiters, and guests were played by real aristocrats.) Fellini combined constructed sets with location shots, depending on script requirements—a real location often &quot;gave birth to the modified scene and, consequently, the newly constructed set.&quot; The film&#x27;s last scenes where the monster fish is pulled out of the sea and Marcello waves goodbye to Paola (the teenage &quot;Umbrian angel&quot;) were shot on location at Passo Oscuro, a small resort town situated on the Italian coast 30 kilometers from Rome.

Fellini scrapped a major sequence that would have involved the relationship of Marcello with Dolores, an older writer living in a tower, to be played by 1930s Academy Award-winning actress Luise Rainer. If the director&#x27;s dealings with Rainer &quot;who used to involve Fellini in futile discussion&quot; were problematic, biographer Kezich argues that while rewriting the screenplay, the Dolores character grew &quot;hyperbolic&quot; and Fellini decided to jettison &quot;the entire story line.&quot;

The scene in the Trevi Fountain was shot over a week in winter: in March according to the BBC, in late January according to Anita Ekberg. Fellini claimed that Ekberg stood in the cold water in her dress for hours without any trouble while Mastroianni had to wear a wetsuit beneath his clothes - to no avail. It was only after the actor &quot;polished off a bottle of vodka&quot; and &quot;was completely pissed&quot; that Fellini could shoot the scene.

====Paparazzo====

The character of Paparazzo, the news photographer (Walter Santesso), was inspired by photojournalist Tazio Secchiaroli and is the origin of the word &quot;paparazzi&quot;, used in many languages to describe intrusive photographers. As to the origin of the character&#x27;s name itself, Fellini scholar Peter Bondanella argues that although &quot;it is indeed an Italian family name, the word is probably a corruption of the word &quot;papataceo&quot;, a large and bothersome mosquito. Ennio Flaiano, the film&#x27;s co-screenwriter and creator of Paparazzo, reports that he took the name from a character in a novel by George Gissing.&quot; Gissing&#x27;s character, Signor Paparazzo, is found in his travel book, &quot;By the Ionian Sea&quot; (1901).

==Themes, motifs and structure==
Marcello is a journalist in Rome during the late 1950s who covers tabloid news of movie stars, religious visions and the self-indulgent aristocracy while searching for a more meaningful way of life. Marcello faces the existential struggle of having to choose between two lives, depicted by journalism and literature. Marcello leads a lifestyle of excess, fame and pleasure amongst Rome&#x27;s thriving popular culture, depicting the confusion and frequency with which Marcello gets distracted by women and power. A more sensitive Marcello aspires to become a writer, of leading an intellectual life amongst the elites, the poets, writers and philosophers of the time. Marcello eventually chooses neither journalism, nor literature. Thematically he opted for the life of excess and popularity by officially becoming a publicity agent.

The theme of the film &quot;is predominantly café society, the diverse and glittery world rebuilt upon the ruins and poverty&quot; of the Italian postwar period. In the opening sequence, a plaster statue of Jesus the Labourer suspended by cables from a helicopter, flies past the ruins of an ancient Roman aqueduct. The statue is being taken to the Pope at the Vatican. Journalist Marcello and a photographer named Paparazzo follow in a second helicopter. The symbolism of Jesus, arms outstretched as if blessing all of Rome as it flies overhead, is soon replaced by the profane life and neo-modern architecture of the &quot;new&quot; Rome, founded on the economic miracle of the late 1950s. (Much of this was filmed in Cinecittà or in EUR, the Mussolini-style area south of Rome.) The delivery of the statue is the first of many scenes placing religious icons in the midst of characters demonstrating their &quot;modern&quot; morality, influenced by the booming economy and the emerging mass-consumer life.

===Seven episodes===
The most common interpretation of the film is a mosaic, its parts linked by the protagonist, Marcello Rubini, a journalist. The seven episodes are:

# Marcello&#x27;s evening with the heiress Maddalena (Anouk Aimée)
# His long, frustrating night with the American actress Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) that ends in the Trevi fountain at dawn
# His reunion with the intellectual Steiner (Alain Cuny). Their relationship is divided into three sequences spread over the film: a) Initial encounter, b) Steiner&#x27;s party and c) Steiner&#x27;s tragedy
# The fake miracle
# Marcello&#x27;s father&#x27;s visit/Steiner&#x27;s Party
# The aristocrat&#x27;s party/Steiner&#x27;s tragedy
# The &quot;orgy&quot; at the beach house

Interrupting the seven episodes is the restaurant sequence with the angelic Paola. The episodes are also framed by a prologue (Jesus over Rome) and epilogue (the monster fish), giving the film its innovative and symmetrically symbolic structure. The evocations are: seven deadly sins, seven sacraments, seven virtues, seven days of creation. Other critics disagree, as Peter Bondanella argues that &quot;any critic of &quot;La dolce vita&quot; not mesmerized by the magic number seven will find it almost impossible to organize the numerous sequences on a strictly numerological basis&quot;.

===An aesthetic of disparity===
The critic Robert Richardson suggests that the originality of &quot;La dolce vita&quot; lies in a new form of film narrative that mines &quot;an aesthetic of disparity&quot;. Abandoning traditional plot and conventional &quot;character development&quot;, Fellini and co-screenwriters Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli forged a cinematic narrative that rejected continuity, unnecessary explanations and narrative logic in favour of seven non-linear encounters between Marcello, a kind of Dantesque Pilgrim and an underworld of 120 characters. The encounters build up a cumulative impression on the viewer that finds resolution in an &quot;overpowering sense of the disparity between what life has been or could be, and what it actually is&quot;.

In a device used earlier in his films, Fellini orders the disparate succession of sequences as movements from evening to dawn. Also employed as an ordering device is the image of a downward spiral that Marcello sets in motion when descending the first of several staircases (including ladders) that open and close episodes. The upshot is that the film&#x27;s aesthetic form, rather than its content, embodies the theme of Rome as a moral wasteland.

==Critical reception==

Writing for &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;, the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia highlighted the film&#x27;s variations in tone,

In &quot;Filmcritica XI&quot;, Italian poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini argued that &quot;&quot;La dolce vita&quot; was too important to be discussed as one would normally discuss a film.

Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, film critic and co-founder of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, felt that

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther praised Fellini&#x27;s

Roger Ebert considered &quot;La dolce vita&quot; as Fellini’s best film, as well as his favorite film of all, and listed it consistently in his top ten films for the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films poll every ten years. Ebert&#x27;s first review for the film, published in October 1961, was nearly the first film review he wrote, before he began his career as a film critic in 1967. The film was a touchstone for Ebert, as his perspective on the movie and his life evolved over time, summarized in his 1997 &quot;Great Movie&quot; review:

Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times wrote
Praising Fellini&#x27;s direction he wrote 
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 95% approval score based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 9.10/10. The consensus states: &quot;An epic, breathtakingly stylish cinematic landmark, &quot;La dolce vita&quot; remains riveting in spite of—or perhaps because of—its sprawling length&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a 95/100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was a big hit in Europe with 13,617,148 admissions in Italy and 2,956,094 admissions in France, for a combined tickets sold in both countries. The film had the second most admissions for an Italian film behind &quot;War and Peace&quot; and was one of the top 10 most watched films in Italy.

The film earned $6 million in rentals in the United States and Canada in its original release and was the highest-grossing foreign language film at the US box office. The film was re-released in North America in 1966 by American International Pictures and earned $1.5 million in rentals. The total gross was $19,516,348.

===Censorship===
Perceived by the Catholic Church as a parody of the second coming of Jesus, the opening scene and the film were condemned by the Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; in 1960. Subject to widespread censorship, the film was banned in Spain, until the death of Franco in 1975. Umberto Tupini, the Minister of Culture of the Tambroni government censored it and other &quot;shameful films&quot;. In Portugal, the film took ten years to pass through its censors and be released in the country (this was due to the censorship that the country suffered during the years of Estado Novo).

===Awards and recognition===
&quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, and won one for Best Costume Design: Black-and-White. It also earned the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; (Golden Palm) at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. The film won best foreign language film award at New York Film Critics Circle awards and National Board of Review awards. It was also nominated for a BAFTA award in best film from any source category.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;La dolce vita&quot; as &quot;one of the most widely seen and acclaimed European movies of the 1960s&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it the 6th Greatest film of all time in 1999. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at number 112 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was included in &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; in 2002. In 2010, the film was ranked #11 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;La dolce vita&quot; ranked 24th in critics&#x27; poll and 14th in directors&#x27; poll. In the 2012 version of the list &quot;La dolce vita&quot; ranked 39th in critics&#x27; poll and 37th in directors&#x27; poll. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 28 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. The film was Voted at No. 59 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 19 by The Guardian&#x27;s readers poll on the list of &quot;40 greatest foreign films of all time&quot;. In 2010, The Guardian ranked the film 23rd in its list of 25 greatest arthouse films. In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked the film 2nd among 69 counted winners of the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; to date, concluding &quot;What’s eternal is Fellini’s melancholy realization that behind modern-day sin, redemption, distraction and the come-hither facade of the sweet life, there lurks only emptiness.&quot; The film ranked 10th in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209 film critics from 43 countries around the world. In 2021 the film was ranked at No. 6 on Time Out magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 best movies of all time&quot;.

<text>William Lacy Kenly (February 18, 1864 – January 10, 1928) was a major general in the United States Army. During World War I, he was a leader of the United States Army Air Service, the progenitor of the United States Air Force.

==Early life ==
William L. Kenly was born on February 18, 1864, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Major William L. Kenly and Marion Hook. His father participated in the American Civil War. His immigrant ancestor was his great great grandfather Rev. Daniel Kenly who emigrated from Scotland to Maryland in the 1700s. Kenly was married to Julie Closson, the daughter of Brigadier General Henry W. Closson.

==Military career ==
He was a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, 12 June 1889, in field artillery and took part on August 16, 1899, in the Battle of Angeles, in the Pampanga Province during the Philippine–American War.

On September 3, 1917, Brigadier General Kenly became the first Chief of Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France, effectively taking control away from the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. Previously a field artillery commander, he did not have experience leading an air force, and General Billy Mitchell wielded a large amount of influence in the AEF&#x27;s operational decisions. Kenly was replaced a short time later by Brig. Gen. Benjamin Foulois. 
Kenly then returned to the United States to become Director of Military Aeronautics from May 20, 1918, to August 28, 1918. During this period, he was the titular head of the newly established United States Army Air Service. He retired in 1919 and King George of Great Britain awarded Kenly the honor of Companion of the Order of the Bath.

==Death==
Kenly died of a heart attack on January 10, 1928, in Washington, D.C. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

<text>Milan Baroš (; born 28 October 1981) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a forward.

In 2005, he was part of the Liverpool team which won the UEFA Champions League. He went on to win Ligue 1 with Lyon in 2007, the FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008 and the Süper Lig with Galatasaray in 2012. He also had spells with Baník Ostrava, where he started his career, and English club Aston Villa, and retired from professional football in 2020 following his fourth spell at Baník Ostrava.

Born in Valašské Meziříčí, Baroš represented the Czech Republic international team in 93 matches, scoring on 41 occasions. He won the Golden Boot as top scorer of the Euro 2004 tournament, where his nation reached the semi-finals. He went on to play in three more major international tournaments. His 41 goals for the Czech Republic is second behind only Jan Koller.

==Club career==

===Early career===
As a boy, Baroš played for youth clubs in Vigantice and Rožnov pod Radhoštěm before joining the youth team of Baník Ostrava at the age of 12. In 1998, he made his debut for the club in the Czech First League, the top division of Czech football, becoming a regular over the next few seasons. In 2000, he won the Talent of the Year award at the Czech Footballer of the Year awards. He was described by the Czech News Agency in the 2000–01 season as &quot;perhaps the biggest star of the [Czech] football league&quot;. He played his last game for the club on 2 December 2001, in a 1–0 loss at Viktoria Žižkov. During his time in Ostrava, he scored 23 league goals in 76 appearances.

===Liverpool===
Baroš joined Liverpool in July 2001 for an undisclosed fee and on a contract of undisclosed length; he joined compatriots Patrik Berger and Vladimír Šmicer at the club. The BBC estimated his transfer fee as £3.2 million. He did not move to England straight away due to delays in obtaining a work permit, which was obtained in December. He made his club debut in a UEFA Champions League tie away to Barcelona on 13 March 2002; he played the last 16 minutes in place of Emile Heskey as the match finished goalless. It was his only appearance of the 2001–02 season.

In the 2002–03 season, Baroš scored twice on his Premiership debut away to Bolton Wanderers on 14 September 2002, as Liverpool won 3–2 away. Baroš was a substitute in the 2003 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United. He entered the game in the second half, but did not play to the end of the game, being substituted himself a minute before the end of the game. Liverpool won the game 2–0 to win the cup, the first major trophy of Baroš&#x27; career. Towards the end of the season, he scored twice in a 6–0 away win over already-relegated West Bromwich Albion in April 2003. He ended his first season in the Premiership with 12 goals for the club.

Baroš broke his ankle in a September 2003 match against Blackburn Rovers, a match which also saw teammate Jamie Carragher sustain a broken leg. Baroš subsequently missed five months of football and scored just two goals in the 2003–04 season. His first goal came in a league match against Leeds United in February 2004, while his other goal was in March in a 1–1 Champions League draw against Marseille. Baroš would later claim that had manager Gérard Houllier stayed at the club after the summer of 2004, he would have put in a transfer request. As it was, Houllier left the club and was replaced by Rafael Benítez.

Baroš entered the 2004–05 season having been the top goalscorer in the summer&#x27;s Euro 2004 tournament. With Michael Owen and Emile Heskey having been sold and new signing Djibril Cissé out with a long-term injury, Baroš was now Liverpool&#x27;s only senior striker. Despite being the club&#x27;s joint top scorer with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against Crystal Palace, Spaniard Fernando Morientes was preferred to Baroš in Liverpool&#x27;s starting lineup for the League Cup Final, a match they lost to Chelsea. However, he did start the 2005 Champions League Final, being substituted after 85 minutes as the game finished 3–3 in normal time. Liverpool went on to win the match on penalties. Baroš reportedly dropped the trophy during the team&#x27;s celebration, leaving a dent, but Liverpool decided not to mend it because it &quot;added to the character&quot; of the trophy. He finished the season with 13 goals, becoming the joint-top scorer for the club. Baroš also received his first red card during the campaign, being sent off for a high challenge on Everton&#x27;s Alan Stubbs in the Merseyside derby on 20 March.

In June 2005, former manager Gérard Houllier, then with French club Lyon, made an approach to sign Baroš. The player rejected the approach, but only made two substitute appearances for Liverpool in the 2005–06 season before leaving the club. He left Liverpool with league figures of 19 goals in 68 appearances.

===Aston Villa===
Baroš moved to Premiership side Aston Villa for a fee of £6.5 million in August 2005, signing a four-year contract. He was given the number 10 shirt. Just ten minutes into his Aston Villa debut, he scored the only goal in his new team&#x27;s league victory over Blackburn. He played a crucial role in Villa&#x27;s League Cup second round victory against Wycombe Wanderers in September. With Villa trailing 3–1 at half time, Baroš scored shortly after the beginning of the second half and won a penalty, which Gareth Barry converted. He also provided the cross for Barry&#x27;s second goal of the game as Villa scored seven goals in the second half, resulting in a final score of 8–3, their biggest win in over 40 years. He set up the first Aston Villa goal in a November match against Sunderland in dubious circumstances; back-heeling the ball, which &quot;looked to have gone out of play&quot; to Aaron Hughes. Hughes&#x27; pass found Kevin Phillips, who opened the scoring against his old club. He later scored a goal himself in the same game, which ended 3–1 to Villa.

In the Boxing Day match against Everton, Baroš was involved thoroughly in the proceedings. He opened the scoring in the 35th minute, having handled the ball immediately beforehand. This was not punished and the referee awarded a goal. Baroš subsequently celebrated in front of the travelling Everton fans, making a gesture as if to listen to them. A number of missiles from the crowd were subsequently thrown in Baroš&#x27; direction. The goal was just his third in what Glenn Moore of &quot;The Independent&quot; described as &quot;an indifferent season&quot; for Baroš. He went on to score his second goal of the game, and Villa&#x27;s fourth, earning him man of the match honours. Baroš scored twice in January 2006&#x27;s fourth round FA Cup win against Port Vale, and added another in the following round&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Manchester City. Late in the season, he scored two goals in the Second City derby against Birmingham City at Villa Park, marking his 11th and 12th goals of the season and winning another man of the match award. He would score no further goals that season.

Baroš failed to score at the start of the 2006–07 season, leading new manager Martin O&#x27;Neill to challenge him in October to prove himself before the January transfer window. He subsequently scored his first goal of the season in December 2006, eight months since scoring his last one, with a close-range equaliser against Sheffield United in a 2–2 draw. Although he also managed to score for Aston Villa in a 2–1 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup, he left the club in January 2007, having scored just once in 17 league matches that season.

===Lyon===
On 22 January 2007, Baroš signed with French side Lyon, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract and reuniting with former manager Gérard Houllier from his time at Liverpool. The deal swapped Baroš with Lyon striker John Carew, who joined Aston Villa on a three-and-a-half-year deal. Just two days after joining the club, he made his Lyon debut in a league match against Bordeaux. He appeared as a substitute, as league leaders Lyon lost 2–1 for their first home defeat of the season. Baroš took part in that year&#x27;s Champions League, featuring as a substitute in a 0–0 draw in Rome against Roma. He played no further part in that season&#x27;s Champions League campaign, as he remained on the bench in the return leg as Lyon were eliminated.

In May 2007, Baroš was accused of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian opponent Stéphane Mbia during Lyon&#x27;s match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture was not intended to be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.

Baroš scored in Lyon&#x27;s opening game of the 2007–08 season as his club won 2–0 against Auxerre. However, he played significantly less under new manager Alain Perrin, making just six starts and scoring a total of three league goals. In mid-November, Baroš revealed a break down in his relationship with Perrin and hinted at a move to another club.

===Portsmouth===
Baroš joined Premier League side Portsmouth on loan from Lyon in January 2008 until the end of the season, with the option of making the move permanent at the end of the loan. Baroš played a significant role in the club winning the 2008 FA Cup. He won Portsmouth&#x27;s match-winning penalty kick in the quarter-final at Manchester United and assisted Nwankwo Kanu&#x27;s deciding goal in the semi-final match against West Bromwich Albion with a suspected handball that went unnoticed by both the referee and his assistant. The final match of Baroš&#x27; loan spell was the 2008 FA Cup Final victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium, where he appeared as an 87th-minute substitute for Kanu. By the end of the season, Baroš had played 16 matches for Portsmouth, including seven as a substitute, although he failed to score. He was one of a number of Portsmouth players to be absent at the team parade after the club won the FA Cup, leading to speculation he could have played his last game for the club. At the end of the season, Baroš returned to Lyon.

===Galatasaray===

In August 2008, Baroš joined Turkish champions Galatasaray from Lyon for a fee of €4.7 million. He made his first appearance against Kayserispor, playing the last 15 minutes. Baroš scored his first two goals for the club in the UEFA Cup first round, first leg game against Bellinzona. Three days later, in his first league start, he once again scored two goals against Kocaelispor, with Galatasaray going on to win the match 4–1. On 21 December 2008, Baroš scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 Süper Lig derby win against Beşiktaş, converting two penalties and scoring one from open play. He scored another hat-trick later in the season against Hacettepe. He finished the 2008–09 season as the Süper Lig top scorer with 20 goals.

Baroš scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season in his third league game when he scored twice in a 4–1 win against Kayserispor. His next two goals came on 13 September where Galatasaray played rivals Beşiktaş. Galatasaray won the match 3–0, with Baroš scoring his third and fourth goals of the season. He scored a total of five times in ten matches before breaking his left foot in two places after a tackle by Emre Belözoğlu in the Fenerbahçe–Galatasaray derby on 25 October 2009. He returned to action four and a half months later on 14 March 2010 for a game against Ankaragücü, scoring a goal on his comeback. During the season, he scored his third hat-trick for the club in a match against Diyarbakirspor. He finished the season with league figures of 11 goals in 17 matches.

In August 2010, a week before the start of the 2010–11 Süper Lig, he extended his contract with Galatasaray for two seasons, keeping him contracted to the club until the end of the 2012–13 season. Although he had been injured during pre-season training, Baroš appeared as a substitute in his club&#x27;s UEFA Europa League qualification match against Karpaty Lviv, scoring twice as Galatasaray returned from 2–0 down to draw the match. At the end of September, he scored his fourth hat-trick for the club against Istanbul Büyükşehir Belediyespor, although he failed to complete the game due to an injury. He scored two more goals in a 4–2 loss against Ankaragücü on 17 October, but was injured again. Baroš was suspended for three matches in March 2011 after insulting referee Fırat Aydınus in a match against Beşiktaş. By the end of the season, Baroš had appeared in 17 league games and scored 9 goals.

Galatasaray started the 2011–12 season well and were top of the league in January, having won eight consecutive league matches. Baroš did not start a match for his club for four weeks, but scored an important goal against Samsunspor in the eighth match of the streak. The club won a ninth-straight game, with Baroš scoring his seventh goal of the season, in the 5–1 win against Kardemir Karabükspor, although he left the game with an injury. He returned from injury in a February match against Antalyaspor, coming on as a substitute, but was on the field of play just 15 minutes before receiving a red card. His dismissal resulted in a three-match suspension. Baroš scored his last goal for the club in April 2012 in the last match of the regular season against Manisaspor.

In 2012, Baroš was told by then-coach Fatih Terim that he would not play for the club any more. He played no competitive football after Euro 2012 and finally left the club in February 2013.

===Return to Baník Ostrava===
On 18 February 2013, Czech club Baník Ostrava announced that Baroš had rejoined the club where he started his career, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract. Under the terms of the contract, his salary was donated to support the youth club of the team. Having not played a competitive match since 21 June of the previous year, he played his first match of the season on 23 February, coming on as a substitute in the 0–0 home draw with Dynamo České Budějovice. He scored a hat-trick in Ostrava&#x27;s 3–0 league victory against Hradec Králové on 9 March 2013, his first hat-trick in the top flight of Czech football.

===Antalyaspor===
On 16 July 2013, Baroš agreed a one-year contract with Turkish club Antalyaspor. He made his club debut in August, appearing as a substitute in a 0–0 Süper Lig draw against Kayseri Erciyesspor. He scored his first goal for Antalyaspor against Bursaspor in August, then his second against Rizespor in October. He suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in December 2013, ruling him out of action for the rest of the season. Baroš returned to the Czech Republic for treatment in January 2014.

===Return to the Czech league===
24 September 2014 saw Baroš re-join Ostrava; he signed a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season. Following the end of the 2014–15 season, Baroš left Ostrava and signed a two-year contract with Mladá Boleslav. Following the end of the 2015–16 season, Baroš left Mladá Boleslav and signed a two-year contract with Slovan Liberec. He only spent one of the two years at Liberec before returning to Baník Ostrava in 2017. On 3 July 2020, 38-year-old Baroš announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of the Czech season, due to persistent injuries.

==International career==

===Youth and early senior careers===

Baroš represented various Czech Republic youth teams ranging from under-15 until under-18. He played in the 2000 Summer Olympics, making three appearances for the team. Baroš took part in two other major tournaments at junior level: the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship where Czech Republic placed second, and the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, which the Czechs won.

Baroš debuted for the Czech senior squad on 25 April 2001 in a friendly match against Belgium whilst scoring his first goal as well. He and national teammate Pavel Nedvěd were both shown the red card in a November 2001 qualification match for the following year&#x27;s World Cup, as the Czech Republic were eliminated by Belgium.

===UEFA Euro 2004===
At UEFA Euro 2004, Baroš scored the first goal for the Czech Republic in their first game of the tournament, a come-from-behind 2–1 victory over Latvia. With the goal he became the youngest goalscorer at the European Championships for the Czech Republic. His second goal of the tournament came against the Netherlands; the Dutch team had taken a two-goal lead over the Czechs before Jan Koller scored from a Baroš pass. Baroš then scored before Vladimír Šmicer completed the scoring, as the Czechs won the game 3–2. The third group match saw the Czech Republic make nine changes to their starting lineup, having already qualified for the quarter-finals. Baroš appeared as a substitute and scored the winning goal, as opponents Germany failed to advance to the next stage of the tournament. Baroš added two goals in two minutes of the second half of the Czechs&#x27; quarter-final win over Denmark, and finished as the tournament&#x27;s Golden Boot winner with five goals.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
In qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Baroš scored five goals for his country, including four in consecutive matches in 2005. An injury to his foot, picked up in a match on 3 June, kept him out of 2006 FIFA World Cup games against the United States and Ghana. He appeared in the Czechs&#x27; final group game against Italy, but appeared unfit and left the game after 64 minutes to be replaced by David Jarolím.

===UEFA Euro 2008 and suspension===
In the run up to UEFA Euro 2008, Baroš had not scored an international goal since March 2007. He started the Czech Republic&#x27;s second group game against Portugal, but Portugal won 3–1 and Baroš failed to score. Jan Koller was preferred to Baroš in the starting lineup for the next match, against Turkey. Despite neither playing in the match nor even being on the pitch, Baroš suffered the indignity of receiving a yellow card during stoppage time at the end of the match.

Baroš was banned indefinitely from playing for his national side in April 2009 after a breach of discipline, having attended a bar late at night. However, he was recalled to the national side after the appointment of Ivan Hašek as head coach.

===National team comeback and retirement===
On 12 August 2009, Baroš marked his national team return with a goal from the penalty spot in the 3–1 home friendly victory against Belgium. The following month, Baroš scored a career high of four goals against San Marino, in a World Cup qualifier which the Czech Republic won 7–0. By doing so, he became only the second player from the Czech Republic to score four goals in an international match.

After the tournament, during which he failed to score, Baroš announced his retirement from international football, having scored a total of 41 international goals in 93 matches. His total of 41 international goals for his country is second only to strike partner Jan Koller, who holds the record with 55.

==Style of play==
Baroš gained the nickname &quot;the Ostravan Maradona&quot; in his native Czech Republic due to perceived similarities with the Argentine footballer of the same name. He was noted particularly for being a quick player with good dribbling skill.

==Personal life==
Baroš was born in the Czech town of Valašské Meziříčí. He is of partial Vlach and Romani descent. He grew up in the village of Vigantice. In 2009, he married Tereza Franková, whom he started dating in 2005. Their son Patrik was born on 1 September 2009.

On 1 November 2007, Baroš was arrested in France while driving at in his black Ferrari F430, on a freeway limited to . Stopped by French police between Lyon and Geneva in the region of Ain, the local authorities said the radar reading of 271 km/h was the fastest speed ever recorded in the region, surpassing the previous mark of set by a motorcyclist in 2000. As a result, Baroš had his car and licence confiscated and had to return to Lyon in a taxi.

<doc id="557041" wikidata="Q2006323" url="?curid=557041" title="Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)">
<text>Surrender is the third studio album by English electronic music duo the Chemical Brothers. It was released on 21 June 1999 in the United Kingdom by Freestyle Dust and Virgin Records and in the United States by Astralwerks. The album saw the duo exploring further various electronic styles, including house music. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot;, &quot;Let Forever Be&quot;, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

== Content ==

&quot;Surrender&quot; features guest vocalists Noel Gallagher (Oasis), Hope Sandoval (Mazzy Star), Bernard Sumner (New Order) and Jonathan Donahue (Mercury Rev).

The album is more experimental than previous efforts. &quot;Let Forever Be&quot; is a clear tribute to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. &quot;Out of Control&quot; is house influenced, and the breakout single &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot; has a rave sound.

Of &quot;The Sunshine Underground&quot;, Tom Rowlands said: &quot;I think the title came from those psychedelic poster books. We wanted it to sound like a live band finding its feet. It was influenced by a live version of &#x27;Angel Sigh&#x27; on Spiritualized&#x27;s &quot;Fucked Up Inside&quot;. It went through a lot of versions and this one&#x27;s a composite of a lot of different takes. I love the mad bit in the middle when it goes into hyperspace and turns into this huge, gurning monster.&quot;

Many of the artists that the duo worked with on this album, they would work with again. The duo were quick to work again with Bobby Gillespie, who appears on the third track and third single &quot;Out of Control&quot;, providing backing vocals: they remixed Gillespie&#x27;s Primal Scream song &quot;Swstk Ys&quot; (as it was titled on the 1999 single release), which later appeared on the band&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Xtrmntr&quot;.

&quot;Surrender&quot; was the first Chemical Brothers album not to feature an appearance by Beth Orton, though she would appear on the following album &quot;Come with Us&quot;, on the song &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot;.

=== Album cover ===
The album and singles artwork were provided by London-based silkscreen artist and illustrator Kate Gibb, using screen prints of photographs found in the Hulton Picture Library. Gibb also went on to illustrate the Chemical Brothers albums &quot;Come with Us&quot;, &quot;We Are the Night,&quot; and &quot;Brotherhood&quot;. The cover image was a treatment of a photograph called &quot;Jesus Amongst the Fans&quot; taken by Richard Young at The Great British Music Festival at the Kensington Olympia in 1976. The &quot;Jesus&quot; in question was a music fan called William Jellett, who had adopted the divine moniker and was often seen dancing ecstatically at concerts across the UK from the 1960s to the 1990s. His &quot;miracles&quot; were to give dried fruit and nuts to strangers. Ed Simons said of the album cover in &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;We liked the idea of everyone else sitting down and being chilled out and just one person really getting it, like one of our gigs in the Midwest, actually&quot;. The magazine stated, however, in February 1999 the duo were confronted with a novel problem: they had, in Simons&#x27; words &quot;about two weeks&quot; to sort out an album cover, plan a live show, and do endless promotional duties in Japan. At one point, the image that was used as the single cover for &quot;Out of Control&quot;, released later in 1999, was intended to be the album cover of &quot;Surrender&quot;.

== Release ==
The album was the band&#x27;s second number one album. It was certified 2× Platinum by the BPI on 30 September 2005. A special tour edition of the album was released in Australia and New Zealand, which contained a second disc of B-sides from the album.

=== Singles ===

&quot;Under the Influence&quot; was released in June 1998 on vinyl as &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 3&quot;, exclusively for use for club DJs. &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot; was released on 26 May 1999 as the first official single from the album. It reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Let Forever Be&quot;, was released on 23 July 1999 and reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by &quot;Out of Control&quot; which was released on 8 October 1999 and reached number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;&quot; was released on 6 March 2000. It was not eligible for the UK charts because it contains five songs instead of three, which is required for qualification.

=== 20th Anniversary Edition ===

On 10 June 2019, the Chemical Brothers announced a 20th Anniversary special edition re-release of Surrender, featuring five unreleased &quot;secret psychedelic mixes&quot;, a collection of b-sides and remixes, a DVD of restored promo videos, live footage of their performance at Glastonbury 2000, art prints, and a book. The set was released on 3CD and 4xLP on 22 November 2019.

== Legacy ==

The album cover appeared in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2001 list of &quot;Q&#x27;s 100 Best Record Covers of All Time&quot;. and is ranked number 981 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd. edition, 2000).

Leeds band the Sunshine Underground took their name from the sixth track on the album.

<text>The renal [[Calyx (anatomy)|calyces]] ( calyx) are conduits in the kidney through which urine passes. The minor calyces form a cup-shaped drain around the apex of the renal pyramids. Urine formed in the kidney passes through a renal papilla at the apex into the minor calyx; four or five minor calyces converge to form a major calyx through which urine passes into the renal pelvis (which in turn drains urine out of the kidney through the ureter).

==Function==
Peristalsis of the smooth muscle originating in pace-maker cells originating in the walls of the calyces propels urine through the renal pelvis and ureters to the bladder. The initiation is caused by the increase in volume that stretches the walls of the calyces. This causes them to fire impulses which stimulate rhythmical contraction and relaxation, called peristalsis. Parasympathetic innervation enhances the peristalsis while sympathetic innervation inhibits it.

==Clinical significance==
A &quot;staghorn calculus&quot; is a kidney stone that may extend into the renal calyces.

A renal diverticulum is diverticulum of renal calyces.

<doc id="557055" wikidata="Q2266683" url="?curid=557055" title="Come with Us">
<text>Come with Us is the fourth studio album by English electronic music duo the Chemical Brothers, released in January 2002 by record labels Virgin and Freestyle Dust in the UK and Astralwerks and Ultra in the US. It features Richard Ashcroft (ex-the Verve) and Beth Orton as guest vocalists.

The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified Gold by the BPI on 1 February 2002.

==Background==
The Chemical Brothers&#x27; second and third albums, &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot;, brought them international fame. The band had a worldwide tour for &quot;Surrender&quot; beginning in 1999, continuing until summer 2000, when they played festivals such as Glastonbury Festival and Creamfields.

Following this, the duo created a new track, premiered in December 2000, when they supported U2. Tom Rowlands seemed to initially have mixed feelings about the song, saying it had &quot;quite a lot of percussion, big, sweeping sort of stuff. Live conga playing, quite spaced out. It&#x27;s like Body &amp; Soul, but really, really hard and twisted, it&#x27;s like high-impact, full-on, but with more organic sounds, and quite intense, without the good vibe.&quot; The track was popular with fans, however, and was eventually issued as the white label release &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 5&quot;, in June 2001.

==Recording==
Work on a new album began in 2000, when it was initially titled &quot;Chemical Four&quot;. The record explores new gear, such as the Parker MIDI Fly guitar. When asked if it would be a &quot;back-to-roots&quot; album, following their change in style with &quot;Surrender&quot;, Ed Simons said, &quot;The first three or four numbers do remind me of those days when we were so excited about putting together little grooves and beats – that whole cut-up era of hip hop. We had Grand Wizard Theodore DJing at our gigs then. Like that scratch segment in &#x27;Afrika&#x27;, those tiny segments where it sounds like a DJ cutting in, those sorts of things used to really excite us. But some of the music is totally removed from that. &#x27;Hoops&#x27; is totally different than anything we – or anyone – have ever done&quot;. The album took eighteen months to record.

In making the record, the string arpeggios and the hard MIDI notes came first. &quot;Then it was about finding the right sounds and building from that point&quot;, says Simons. The album&#x27;s drum programming started with doing the snare sound, then a kick, and a bit of &quot;high-end ssshhhhhh&quot;. The duo said they &quot;took the actual individual drum sounds, then wrote the chords. We always sample tiny fragments of sound as a starting point. But there were more definite tunes and ideas and melodies from the start of this album than before&quot;. They also experimented with Emagic Logic Audio, which proved successful in the album&#x27;s production as it never crashed, unlike Steinberg Cubase, which the band had used previously.

==Release==
During the month of release, the Chemical Brothers received retrospective respect from publications such as &quot;Muzik&quot; magazine. Promotion for the album started in September 2001, and concluded in November 2002.

&quot;Come with Us&quot; was released on 28 January 2002 in the UK, following the single &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;, a variation of the band&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 5&quot;, which was issued in September 2001 and appears on the album, as well as the release of the single &quot;Star Guitar&quot;. The tracks proved successful, both reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. The album itself entered at number 1, being the band&#x27;s third consecutive number 1 album. As well as these two singles, the track &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;, popularized on the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; soundtrack in the summer of 2001, also appears on the album,

In its opening week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, the record sold 30,000 copies.

===Singles and EPs===
&quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; was released in June 2001 as &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 5&quot;, exclusively for DJs to test in clubs. It was officially issued as the first single on 10 September 2001 and reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The version on the album is a six-minute edit that segues into &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; was released on 14 January 2002 and reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Come with Us&quot; and &quot;The Test&quot; were released as a double A-side single on 22 April 2002, reaching number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. In Japan, the names in the title of the single were reversed. &quot;Hoops&quot; was released on 1 June 2002 in remixed form as &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 6&quot;, exclusively for DJs to test in clubs.

At the time of their Japan tour, the tie-in extended play titled &quot;Come with Us/Japan Only EP&quot; was released exclusively in that country, on 17 July 2002. The &quot;AmericanEP&quot; was issued exclusively to in the United States on 19 November 2002, in promotion of the North Amerika tour. &quot;Come with Us&quot; and &quot;The Test&quot; were also issued as separate promo singles in addition to the retail double A-side.

==Reception==
Initial critical response to &quot;Come with Us&quot; was generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 72, based on 23 reviews. &quot;Kludge&quot; included it on their list of best albums of 2002.

Andy Puleston of the BBC said that &quot;years ago Tom and Ed assured us &#x27;the brother&#x27;s gonna work it out&#x27;. If you&#x27;ve ever felt that they had yet to make good on this promise then, as far as Come with Us is concerned there was never a truer word spoken.&quot; His review also acknowledged the success of &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;, saying that by &quot;removing shrubs, laying concrete and generally paving the way for this album, &quot;Afrika&quot; conquered Ibiza, Notting Hill Carnival and contrived a craving amongst those with an affinity for a big, bouncy kick drum.&quot;

AllMusic said that &quot;After forgetting the key on 1999&#x27;s &quot;Surrender&quot; amidst handling all of the celebrity guests, they got back to business with Come with Us&quot;, and that &quot;from the vocal sample introducing the opener (&quot;behold...they&#x27;re coming back&quot;), it&#x27;s clear Rowlands and Simons know the importance of this fourth album, and it detonates like a bomb blast, as though the duo knew that Come with Us had to be bigger and badder than all the bombastic breaks they&#x27;d dropped in the past.&quot;

Following the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on two tours, the Go with Them tour and the North Amerika tour.

<doc id="557058" wikidata="Q2495176" url="?curid=557058" title="United Free Church of Scotland">
<text>The United Free Church of Scotland (UF Church; , ) is a Scottish Presbyterian denomination formed in 1900 by the union of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland (or UP) and the majority of the 19th-century Free Church of Scotland. The majority of the United Free Church of Scotland united with the Church of Scotland in 1929.

== Origins ==
The Free Church of Scotland seceded from the Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843. The United Presbyterian Church was formed in 1847 by a union of the United Secession and Relief Churches, both of which had split from the Church of Scotland. The two denominations united in 1900 to form the United Free Church (except for a small section of the Free Church who rejected the union and continued independently under the name of the Free Church).

==Legal dispute:&quot;The Free Church Case&quot;==
The minority of the Free Church, which had refused to join the union, quickly tested its legality. They issued a summons, claiming that in altering the principles of the Free Church, the majority had ceased to be the Free Church of Scotland and therefore forfeited the right to its assets – which should belong to the remaining minority, who were the true &#x27;Free Church&#x27;. However, the case was lost in the Court of Session, where Lord Low (upheld by the second division) held that the Assembly of original Free Church had a right, within limits, to change its position.

An appeal to House of Lords, (not delivered until 1 August 1904 due to a judicial death), reversed the Court of Session&#x27;s decision (by a majority of 5–2), and found the minority entitled to the assets of the Free Church. It was held that, by adopting new standards of doctrine (and particularly by abandoning its commitment to &#x27;the establishment principle&#x27; – which was held to be fundamental to the Free Church), the majority had violated the conditions on which the property of the Free Church was held.

The judgement had huge implications; seemingly it deprived the Free Church element of the UF Church of all assets—churches, manses, colleges, missions, and even provision for elderly clergy. It handed large amounts of property to the remnant; more than it could make effective use of. A conference, held in September 1904, between representatives of the UF and the (now distinct) Free Church, to come to some working arrangement, found that no basis for agreement could be found. A convocation of the UF Church, held on 15 December, decided that the union should proceed, and resolved to pursue every lawful means to restore their assets. As a result, the intervention of Parliament was sought.

A parliamentary commission was appointed, consisting of Lords Elgin, Kinnear and Anstruther. The question of interim possession was referred to Sir John Cheyne. The commission sat in public, and after hearing both sides, issued their report in April 1905. They stated that the feelings of both parties towards the other had made their work difficult. They concluded, however, that the Free Church was in many respects unable to carry out the purposes of the trusts, which, under the ruling of the House of Lords, was a condition of their holding the property. They recommended that an executive commission should be set up by act of parliament, in which the whole property of the Free Church, as at the date of the union, should be vested, and which should allocate it to the United Free Church, where the Free Church was unable to carry out the trust purposes.

The Churches (Scotland) Act 1905, which gave effect to these recommendations, was passed in August. The commissioners appointed were those on whose report the act was formed, plus two others. The allocation of churches and manses was a slow business, but by 1908 over 100 churches had been assigned to the Free Church. Some of the dispossessed UF Church congregations, most of them in the Highlands, found shelter for a time in the parish churches; but it was early decided that in spite of the objection against the erection of more church buildings in districts where many were now standing empty, 60 new churches and manses should at once be built at a cost of about £150,000. In October 1906 the commission intimated that the Assembly Hall, and the New College Buildings, were to belong to the UF Church, while the Free Church received the offices in Edinburgh, and a tenement to be converted into a college, while the library was to be vested in the UF Church, but open to members of both. After having held its Assembly in university class-rooms for two years, and in another hall in 1905, in 1906 the UF Church again occupied the historic buildings of the Free Church. All the foreign missions and all the continental stations were also adjudged to the United Free Church. (Incidentally, the same act also contained provided for the relaxation of subscription in the Church of Scotland, thus Parliament had involved itself in the affairs of all Presbyterian churches.)

==Existence 1900–1929==

The United Free Church was during its relatively short existence the second largest Presbyterian church in Scotland. The Free Church brought into the union 1,068 congregations, the United Presbyterians 593. Combined they had a membership of some half a million Scots. The revenue of the former amounted to £706,546, of the latter to £361,743. The missionaries of both churches joined the union, and the united Church was then equipped with missions in various parts of India, in Manchuria, in Africa (Lovedale, Livingstonia, etc.), in Palestine, in Melanesia and in the West Indies.

The UFC was broadly liberal Evangelical in its approach to theology and practical issues. It combined an acceptance of the findings of contemporary science, and the more moderate results of higher criticism with commitment to evangelism and missions. The UFC&#x27;s approach to doctrinal conformity was fairly liberal for a Presbyterian denomination at the time. In its 1906 &quot;Act Anent Spiritual Independence of the Church&quot;, its General Assembly asserted the power to modify or define its Subordinate standard (the Westminster Confession) and its laws. Although its subordinate standard remained, ministers and elders were asked to state their belief in &quot;the doctrine of this Church, set forth in the Confession of Faith&quot;. Thus the Church&#x27;s interpretation of doctrine was prioritised over the confession.

The UFC had three divinity halls, at Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, served by 17 professors and five lecturers. The first moderator was Robert Rainy. Its theologians and scholars have included H.R. Mackintosh, James Moffatt as well as John and Donald Baillie. British Prime Minister Bonar Law was raised in a Canadian Free Church manse and was a member of the United Free Church in Helensburgh.

==Union with the Church of Scotland==
As its early days were preoccupied with the aftermath of union, so its later days were with the coming union with the Church of Scotland. The problem was the CofS&#x27;s position as an established church conflicted with the Voluntaryism of the UFC. Discussions began in 1909, but were complex. The Very Rev William Paterson Paterson, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland made much progress during his period in office 1919/20.

The main hurdles were overcome by two parliamentary statutes, firstly the Church of Scotland Act 1921, which recognised the Church of Scotland&#x27;s independence in spiritual matters (a right asserted by its Articles Declaratory of 1919). The second was the Church of Scotland (Properties and Endowments) Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 33), which transferred the secular endowment of the church to a new body called the &quot;General Trustees&quot;. These measures satisfied the majority of the UFC that the Church-state entanglement of the Church of Scotland, which had been the cause of the Disruption of 1843 had at last ended. In 1929, the merger with the Church of Scotland largely reversed the Disruption of 1843 and reunited much of Scottish Presbyterianism. On 2 October 1929, at an assembly at the Industrial Hall on Annandale Street off Leith Walk in Edinburgh, the two churches merged. The Hall is now the central bus depot for Lothian Region Transport.

A relatively small minority stayed out of the union, and retained the name of U.F. Church.

==The continuing UFC, 1929–present==
Voluntaryism led some to oppose the union (the United Free Church Association, led by James Barr – minister of Govan and Labour MP for Motherwell). When it came, 13,000 UFC members remained outside, calling themselves the United Free Church (Continuing). The phrase &#x27;continuing&#x27; was used for five years to avoid confusion between the remaining United Free Church and the pre-union Church. It was dropped from the title in 1934. An agreement between the parties avoided the property disputes of the 1900 union. UFC members increased slightly during the 1930s, to a peak of 23,000 by 1939, but it never regained anywhere near the numbers it had had prior to the union with the Church of Scotland.

The ongoing UFC continues in the &#x27;broad evangelical&#x27; tradition.

The continuing UFC agreed to permit the ordination of female ministers in 1929. The church elected a woman as its moderator in 1960, when Elizabeth Barr became the first female moderator of a general assembly of a Scottish church.

In 2016, the UFC had 53 congregations in its three presbyteries. By 2022, this had reduced to 47 congregations. These three presbyteries are &#x27;The East&#x27;, &#x27;The West&#x27; and &#x27;The North&#x27;.

* The East: meets in Bo&#x27;ness and covers central Scotland, South Fife and the Lothians. It has 14 congregations.
* The West which meets in Glasgow and covers Strathclyde, and has 21 congregations within its bounds.
* The North meets in Aberdeen and Perth covering Tayside, The Highlands, Grampian and the Northern Isles. It has 12 congregations.

The General Assembly of the United Free Church of Scotland meets annually, beginning on the Wednesday after the first Sunday in June, and lasting until the Friday. Since 2008, they have committed to having the General Assembly in a central location, meeting in the Salutation Hotel, Perth.

In 2016, they had 60 ordained ministers, including retired and those serving part-time. There were three students, and a further three probationer ministers. The denomination has 388 Elders, and 255 Deacons, Managers or board members who are not Elders. 

In 2023, there were 22 serving ministers, along with seven Ministry Assistants. There was one Student Minister, and 22 Retired Ministers. The denomination has 300 Elders, and 183 Deacons, Managers or board members who are not Elders. The total membership (Communicants) at the end of 2023 was 1782 individuals.

===Ecumenical relations===
The modern UFC is involved in the ecumenical movement in Scotland and is a member of Action of Churches Together in Scotland. Internationally, it is a member of the World Council of Churches,

=== Churches ===
The denomination, as of 31 December 2023, currently has 47 congregations.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow or Zachau (14 November 1663 – 7 August 1712) was a German musician and composer of vocal and keyboard music.

==Life==
Zachow was born in Leipzig. He probably received his training from his father, the piper Heinrich Zachow, one of Leipzig&#x27;s town musicians in the Alta capella, and maybe from Johann Schelle, a leading German composer, when the family moved to Eilenburg. As Kantor and organist of Halle&#x27;s Market Church in 1684 he succeeded Samuel Ebart. During his time at Halle he became particularly renowned as a composer of dramatic cantatas. In 1695 he was criticized by the pietists because of his excessive long and elaborate music, that could be only appreciated by cantors and organists. Zachow was influenced by Johann Theile in Merseburg and the poetry of Erdmann Neumeister, pastor in the nearby Weissenfels, and his criticism on pietism.

Zachow was the teacher of Gottfried Kirchhoff, Johann Philipp Krieger and Johann Gotthilf Ziegler, but is best remembered as George Frideric Handel&#x27;s first music teacher. He taught Handel how to play the violin, organ, harpsichord, and oboe as well as counterpoint. Zachow&#x27;s teaching was so effective, that in 1702, Handel accepted a position as organist at the former Dom in Halle at age seventeen. It is said that after Zachow died in 1712, Handel became a benefactor to his widow and children in gratitude for his teacher&#x27;s instruction. In 1713 J.S. Bach was invited as Zachow&#x27;s successor.

Handel continued to use Zachow&#x27;s compositions in his own works, not simply quoting, but also in terms of instrumental colour; for example the cantata &quot;Herr, wenn ich nur dich habe&quot;, which is unique in having a harp solo in the German cantata repertoire, was copied by Handel, taken to London, and may have influenced the instrumentation of &quot;Saul&quot; and &quot;Esther&quot;.

Zachow died in Halle at age 48.

<doc id="557080" wikidata="Q286926" url="?curid=557080" title="United Presbyterian Church (Scotland)">
<text>The United Presbyterian Church (1847–1900) was a Scottish Presbyterian denomination. It was formed in 1847 by the union of the United Secession Church and the Relief Church, and in 1900 merged with the Free Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland, which in turn united with the Church of Scotland in 1929. For most of its existence, the United Presbyterian Church was the third largest presbyterian church in Scotland, and stood on the liberal wing of Scots Presbyterianism. The church&#x27;s name was often abbreviated to the initials UP.

==United Secession Church==
The United Secession Church was founded in 1820 by the union of various churches which had previously seceded from the established Church of Scotland. The First Secession had been in 1732, and the resultant Associate Presbytery grew to include 45 congregations. A series of disputes, in 1747 over the burgesses oath, and in the late 18th century over the Westminster confession, led to further splits, but in 1820 two of the groups united to form the United Associate Synod of the Secession Church, also known as the United Secession Church.

==The Relief Church==

The Presbytery of Relief was constituted in 1761 by three ministers of the Church of Scotland, one of whom was Thomas Gillespie, who had been deposed by the assembly in 1752 for refusing to take part in the intrusion of unacceptable ministers. The number of congregations under its charge increased with considerable rapidity, and a Relief Synod was formed in 1773, which in 1847 had under its jurisdiction 136 congregations.

The Relief Church issued no distinctive testimonies, and a certain breadth of view was shown in the formal declaration of their terms of communion, first made in 1773, which allowed occasional communion with those of the episcopal and independent persuasions.

In 1794, the Relief Church adopted as its hymn book Patrick Hutchison&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Songs and Hymns on Various Passages of Scripture&quot;, and it was Hutchison who established the first systematic definition of the Relief Church&#x27;s beliefs.

A Relief theological hall was instituted in 1824.

==The union==
In 1847, a union formed between all the congregations of the United Secession Church and 118 out of 136 of the Relief Churches, in what then became the United Presbyterian Church. It was the first presbyterian body to relax the stringency of subscription, the Church Synod passing a declaratory act on the subject in 1879. On such points as that of the six days&#x27; creation, it was made clear that freedom was allowed; but when David Macrae of Gourock claimed that it should also be allowed on the question of eternal punishment, he was at once declared to be no longer a minister of the church. He left behind him many who sympathized with his position, and in the remaining part of the 19th century the United Presbyterian Church came fully to share the forward movement of thought of the other Scottish churches.

Doctrinally, little distinguished the United Presbyterian Church and the Free Church of Scotland, and between 1863 and 1873 negotiations took place on a union, which however proved fruitless due to different views on the relationship between state and church. But in 1896, the United Presbyterian Church again made advances, which were promptly met, and on 31 October 1900 the United Free Church of Scotland came into existence.
The final moderator (1899/1900) of the UP was Very Rev. Alexander Mair (1834-1911).

==Church buildings==
The United Presbyterian Church constructed a number of notable buildings, the largest of which often used a neoclassical design with a portico. A particularly fine example is Wellington Church, near the University of Glasgow, which was built in 1883–84 by the architect Thomas Lennox Watson. This preference for neoclassical architecture contrasts strongly with the prevailing mid-Victorian taste for Gothic Revival in most of the other Scottish churches. Most U.P. churches were, however, far more modestly built than Wellington.

The famous architect Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson (1817–1875) designed three striking UP church buildings in Glasgow at Caledonia Road Church (1856), St Vincent Street Church (1859), and Queen&#x27;s Park (1867). Of the three, only St Vincent Street survives intact, Caledonia Road Church being an empty shell and Queen&#x27;s Park destroyed by World War II bombing.

Alexander Thomson was a member of the United Presbyterian Church. His architectural style was often eclectic; it cannot be described as truly neoclassical (he never managed to visit Greece), but he frequently used Egyptian and other Middle Eastern motifs. His interior designs and colour schemes for churches were strongly influenced by Biblical descriptions of King Solomon&#x27;s Temple, for example the reference to pomegranates in 2 Chronicles 4:13 and the furnishings mentioned in 1 Kings 6:15-36.

<text>John Tupper (Jack) Saywell (April 3, 1929 – 20 April 2011) was a Canadian historian specializing in the fields of politics and constitution.

==Early life and education==
John Tupper Saywell was born on April 3, 1929, to parents John Ferdinand Tupper Saywell and Vera Marguerite Saywell in Weyburn, Saskatchewan.

Upon the birth of his younger brother William G. Saywell, the family moved to British Columbia in 1937. His father had received a job position to become Lake Cowichan first high school principal. Saywell received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of British Columbia and his Ph.D. from Harvard University.

==Career==
He taught at the University of Toronto from 1954 to 1962. He joined York University in 1963 and was Dean of Arts at York from 1963 to 1973. Saywell retired from all teaching responsibility at York University in 1999.

== Work as Historian ==

Saywell was the editor of two journals: &quot;Canadian Historical Review&quot;, from 1957 to 1963; and &quot;Canadian Annual Review&quot; from 1960 to 1979. Among his books were &quot;The Office of Lieutenant-Governor: A Study in Canadian Government and Politics&quot;, which won the Delancey K. Jay Prize at Harvard University. &quot;Just Call Me Mitch: The Life of Mitchell F. Hepburn&quot;, published in 1991, won the Floyd Chalmers Award for the best book on Ontario history. His 2002 study of the Supreme Court of Canada, titled &quot;The Lawmakers: Judicial Power and the Shaping of Canadian Federalism&quot;, won the John W. Dafoe Prize for &quot;distinguished writing on Canada and/or Canada’s place in the world.&quot; He also interpreted Canadian, British and European history for thousands of high-school students across Ontario through close to a dozen textbooks with his friend John Ricker.

== Legacy ==
The John T. Saywell Prize for Canadian Legal History was endowed by his family and friends and is given bi-annually by the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History to the best new book in Canadian legal history. He was director of the graduate program in history at York from 1987 to 1998; its Ph.D. graduates can be found in most major Canadian universities.

<doc id="557084" wikidata="Q531193" url="?curid=557084" title="Microsoft Most Valuable Professional">
<text>The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award is given by Microsoft to &quot;technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community&quot;. They are awarded to people who &quot;actively share their ... technical expertise with the different technology communities related directly, or indirectly to Microsoft&quot;. The MVP recognition lasts for a year and is awarded for a person&#x27;s Microsoft related activity, contributions and influence over the previous year.

The MVP program grew out of the software developer community. Some of the earliest MVPs were those most active in online peer support communities, such as Usenet and CompuServe. It has since grown to include other types of products, and other avenues of contribution. Steve Ballmer spoke to a group of Microsoft MVPs about Windows XP and Windows Vista.

A posting from Tamar Granor on the Universal Thread web site gives this account of the origin of the MVP program.

==Earning the Microsoft MVP Award==
The rules and guidelines to getting awarded as a Microsoft MVP are not strictly defined. The reason for this is that every Microsoft MVP contributes to the community in different ways. However, the largest key indicator Microsoft looks for when considering someone for the Microsoft MVP Award is how much impact their activities over the last 12 months have on the community.

==Cancellation and reinstatement==
On October 22, 1999, a Microsoft executive sent out a message announcing the cancellation of the MVP program. This may have been in response to a recent suit against AOL by its newsgroup leaders, who felt that they deserved to be paid for the time they put in online. After an outpouring of online support to the MVP program, including many emails sent directly to Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, Microsoft announced three days later that the cancellation had been rescinded. This then led to discussions across the company about which division would own the expenses for this program. The program stayed in support, but additional investments were made - one of the original CompuServe engineers was brought in for a new position as Director of Community, reinvigorating the MVP program with a dedicated project coordinator, site resources and support engineers. The program became far more successful through these efforts, expanding its global footprint and receiving coverage with more than 100 independent press articles, eventually landing as one of Microsoft&#x27;s Board of Director&#x27;s 7 Big Bets for 2007.

<doc id="557085" wikidata="Q979370" url="?curid=557085" title="Zero population growth">
<text>Zero population growth, sometimes abbreviated ZPG, is a condition of demographic balance where the number of people in a specified population neither grows nor declines; that is, the number of births plus in-migrants equals the number of deaths plus out-migrants. ZPG has been a prominent political movement since the 1960s.

As part of the concept of optimum population, the movement considers zero population growth to be an objective towards which countries and the whole world should strive in the interests of accomplishing long-term optimal standards and conditions of living.

== Definition ==
The growth rate of a population in a given year equals the number of births minus the number of deaths plus immigration minus emigration expressed as a percentage of the population at the beginning of the given year.

For example, suppose a country begins a year with one million people and during the year experiences one hundred thousand births, eighty thousand deaths, one thousand immigrants and two hundred emigrants.  

Change in population = 100,000 – 80,000 +1,000 – 200 = 20,800 

Population growth rate = (20,800 ÷ 1,000,000) x 100% = 2.1%

Zero population growth for a country occurs when the sum of these four numbers – births minus deaths plus immigration minus emigration - is zero.

To illustrate, suppose a country begins the year with one million people and during the year experiences 85,000 births, 86,000 deaths, 1,500 immigrants and 500 emigrants.          

Change in population = 85,000 – 86,000 + 1,500 – 500 = 0

Population growth rate = (0 ÷ 1,000,000) x 100% = 0%

For the planet Earth as a whole, zero population growth occurs when the number of births equals the number of deaths. 

==History==
The American sociologist and demographer Kingsley Davis is credited with coining the term. However, it was used earlier by George J. Stolnitz, who stated that the concept of a stationary population dated back to 1693. A mathematical description was given by James Mirrlees.

In the late 1960s, ZPG became a prominent political movement in the U.S. and parts of Europe, with strong links to environmentalism and feminism. Yale University was a stronghold of the ZPG activists who believed &quot;that a constantly increasing population is responsible for many of our problems: pollution, violence, loss of values and of individual privacy.&quot; Prominent advocates of the movement were Paul Ehrlich, author of &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, Richard Bowers, a Connecticut lawyer, and Professor Charles Lee Remington.

==Mechanisms==
In the long term, zero population growth can be achieved when the birth rate of a population equals the death rate. That is, the total fertility rate is at replacement level and birth and death rates are stable, a condition also called demographic equilibrium. Unstable rates can lead to drastic changes in population levels. This analysis is valid for the planet as a whole, but not necessarily for a region or country as it ignores migration. 

Population momentum. Even when the total fertility rate of a population reaches replacement level, that population usually continues to grow because of population momentum. A population that has been growing in the past will have a higher proportion of young people. As it is younger people who have children, there is a time lag between the point at which the fertility rate (mean total number of children each woman has) falls to the replacement level and the point at which the population stops growing. The reason for this is that even though the fertility rate has dropped to replacement level, people already continue to live for some time within a population. Therefore, equilibrium, with a static population, will not be reached until the first &quot;replacement level&quot; birth cohorts reach old age and die.

Aging populations. Conversely, with fertility below replacement, the fraction of elderly grows; but since that generation failed to replace itself during its fertile years, a subsequent &quot;population bust&quot;, or decrease in population, will occur when the older generation dies off. This effect has been termed birth dearth. In addition, if a country&#x27;s fertility is at replacement level, and has been that way for at least several decades (to stabilize its age distribution), then that country&#x27;s population could still experience growth due to increasing life expectancy, even though the population growth is likely to be smaller than it would be from natural population increase.

==Reaching zero population growth==
Zero population growth is often a goal of demographic planners and environmentalists who believe that reducing population growth is essential for the health of the ecosystem. Achieving ZPG in the short run is difficult because a country&#x27;s population growth is often determined by economic factors, incidence of poverty, natural disasters, disease, etc.

Albert Bartlett, who was a professor of physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, suggested that a population has the following choices to achieve ZPG:

# Voluntarily limit births and immigration to achieve zero population growth;
#Continue on the present path until the population is so large that draconian measures become necessary to stop the growth of population;
#Do nothing and let nature stop the growth through disease, starvation, war, and pestilence. If humans do not solve the problem, nature will.

Similarly, Jason Brent argues that there are three ways to achieve zero population growth. His argument is as follows:

# By war, with or without weapons of mass destruction, starvation, disease, rape, murder, ethnic cleansing, concentration camps, and other horrors beyond the imagination, when humanity has exceeded the carrying capacity of the Earth.
# By the voluntary action of all of humanity prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth. If any group or even if a single-family failed to control its population the entire program would fail.
# By coercive population control prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth.
A loosely defined goal of ZPG is to match the replacement fertility rate, which is the average number of children per woman which would hold the population constant. This replacement fertility will depend on mortality rates and the sex ratio at birth, and varies from around 2.1 in developed countries to over 3.0 in some developing countries.

==China and India==
China and India are the largest countries by population in the world, each having some 1.4 billion people (as of 2023). 

China reached a population plateau (zero growth) in 2022. China&#x27;s population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century. This has been mostly the result of China&#x27;s economic growth and increasing living standards. However, many demographers also credit China&#x27;s family planning policy, formulated in the early 1970s, that encouraged late marriages, late childbearing, and the use of contraceptives, and after 1980 limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children. 

According to government projections, the long-term effect of these policies will be a reduction of the working-age population to 700 million by 2050 vs 925 million in 2011, a decline of 24%. In November 2013, a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity and the forecast of a reduced labor pool and support for an aging population.

India reached replacement level in 2021. However, the Indian population will keep growing for decades, given its relatively young population (see &quot;Mechanisms&quot; above).

<text>Somalia is a federal republic. It consists of 6 federal member states--Somaliland, Puntland, Galmudug, Hirshaabelle, South West, and Jubaland--as well as an interim administration, Khatumo, and a regional administration, Banaadir. Somalia is further subdivided into 18 administrative regions (&quot;gobollo&quot;, singular &quot;gobol&quot;), which are in turn subdivided into districts.

== History ==
Puntland is a federal state in the northeast of Somalia. Galmudug is a federal state in central Somalia. Jubaland is a federal state in the south of Somalia. In November 2014, the South West State of Somalia was established. Hirshabelle State was formed in October 2016. Khatumo State in the north central region was recognized in 2023.

The Federal Parliament is tasked with selecting the ultimate number and boundaries of autonomous regional states within the Federal Republic of Somalia. To this end, the legislature in December 2014 passed a law establishing the Boundary and Federalization Commission. The body is mandated with determining the boundaries of the country&#x27;s constituent states, as well as arbitrating between these states.

== Federal member states ==

Somalia is officially divided into 6 federal member states, including the unrecognized country of Somaliland.

* Somaliland
* Puntland
* Galmudug
* Hirshabelle
* South West
* Jubaland

== Interim administrations ==
The SSC-Khatumo Administration was recognized as an interim administration by the Federal Government of Somalia on 19 October 2023.

* Khatumo

== Regional administrations ==
The Banaadir Regional Administration (BRA) covers the area of the capital city Mogadishu, and does not belong to any federal member state.

* Banaadir

== Regions ==
President of Somalia Mohamed Siad Barre established five of these regions in 1974 and 1975 for biased clan reasons, Middle Juba, Lower Juba, Gedo, Bay, and Bakool; Banaadir shrank to consist of only Mogadishu at the same time.

Below are the regions of Somalia, with their capitals shown in parentheses:

* Awdal (Borama)
* Bakool (Hudur)
* Banadir (Mogadishu)
* Bari (Bosaso)
* Bay (Baidoa)
* Galgaduud (Dhusamareb)
* Gedo (Garbahaarreey)
* Hiiraan (Beledweyn)
* Lower Juba (Kismayo)
* Lower Shabelle (Merca)
* Middle Juba (Bu&#x27;ale)
* Middle Shebelle (Jowhar)
* Mudug (Galkayo)
* Nugal (Garowe)
* Sanaag (Erigavo)
* Sool (Las Anod)
* Togdheer (Burao)
* Woqooyi Galbeed (Hargeisa)

<doc id="557091" wikidata="Q965635" url="?curid=557091" title="Underground hip-hop">
<text>Underground hip-hop (also commonly known as indie hip-hop or underground rap) is an umbrella term for hip-hop music that is outside the general commercial canon. However, in the modern day, it is used to refer to minigenres such as plugg, rage, SoundCloud rap and underground r&amp;b, or any experimental genre that incorporates either themes of trap music or themes of plugg or rage even with traces of R&amp;B and soul with heavy use of Auto-Tune in a sung rap manner, or over a rage beat (subgenre of trap) as popularized by rappers such as Che, Prettifun or [[Underground hip-hop|Osamason]]. SoundCloud has been described as a &quot;breeding ground&quot; for upcoming underground rappers It is typically associated with independent artists, signed to independent labels or no label at all. Underground hip-hop is often characterized by socially conscious, positive, or anti-commercial lyrics. However, there is no unifying or universal theme—AllMusic suggests that it &quot;has no sonic signifiers&quot;. &quot;The Underground&quot; also refers to the community of musicians, fans and others that support non-commercial, or independent music. Music scenes with strong ties to underground hip-hop include alternative hip-hop and conscious hip-hop. Many artists who are considered &quot;underground&quot; today were not always so, and may have previously broken the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

==Style==
Underground hip-hop encompasses several different styles of music. Numerous acts in the book &quot;How to Rap&quot; (2009) are described as being both underground and politically or socially aware, these include B. Dolan, Brother Ali, Diabolic, Immortal Technique, Jedi Mind Tricks, Micranots, Mr. Lif, Murs, Little Brother, P.O.S, Zion I, and Madlib.

Underground artists with critically acclaimed albums include Atmosphere, Binary Star, Blu, Cannibal Ox, Company Flow, Del the Funky Homosapien, Roc Marciano, Danny Brown, Freestyle Fellowship, Hieroglyphics, Juggaknots, Jurassic 5, Kool Keith, Little Brother, MF DOOM, Non Phixion, Planet Asia, RJD2, and MC TP.

Additionally, many underground hip-hop artists have been applauded for the artistic and poetic use of their lyrics, such as Aesop Rock, Aceyalone, Busdriver, Cage, CunninLynguists, Dessa, OhSo Kew, Doomtree, El-P, Eyedea &amp; Abilities, Illogic, Onry Ozzborn, MF DOOM, Rob Sonic, billy woods, and Sage Francis.

Some underground artists produce music that celebrates the fundamental elements or pillars of hip-hop culture, such as Artifacts, Dilated Peoples, People Under the Stairs, and Fashawn, whose music &quot;recalls hip-hop&#x27;s golden age&quot;.

==Early beginnings==
In hip-hop&#x27;s formative years, the vast majority of the genre was underground music, by definition. Although the Sugarhill Gang gained commercial success in 1979, most artists did not share such prominence until the mid-1980s. Ultramagnetic MCs&#x27; debut album, &quot;Critical Beatdown&quot; (1988), is seen as one of the earliest examples of &quot;underground hip hop&quot;. It was described that the album was characteristic of what would later be known as &quot;Underground Hip Hop&quot;. New York underground rapper Kool Keith received notable success with his album &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot;, gaining more attention than any contemporary independent hip hop album &quot;in quite a while&quot;. &quot;The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show&quot; was a notable underground hip-hop radio show that was broadcast on WKCR, and later WQHT, in New York City from 1990 until 1999. It featured rappers such as The Notorious B.I.G., Big L, Jay-Z, and Eminem, as well as groups like Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, Onyx and Fugees, all before they gained any popularity. In 1999, Prince Paul and Breeze Brewin&#x27; created one of the first rap opera albums, named &quot;A Prince Among Thieves&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a 4.5/5.

In the late 1990s, progressive rap acts such as Black Star and Juggaknots helped inspire and shape the underground hip-hop movement that would follow in subsequent decades.

==Current underground scene==

* Plugg
* East Coast hip hop

<text>Adam Gib (15 April 1714 – 14 June 1788) was a Scottish religious leader, head of the Antiburgher section of the Scottish Secession Church. He reportedly wrote his first covenant with God in the blood of his own veins. Gib was born in the parish of Muckhart, in southern Perthshire on 15 April 1714.

He studied literature and theology at the University of Edinburgh and at Perth, and was licensed as a preacher in 1740. His eldest brother being a prodigal son, Adam succeeded to the paternal estate, but burned the will when his brother promised to reform. In 1741 he was ordained minister of the large Secession congregation of Bristo Street, Edinburgh. In 1745 he was almost the only Edinburgh minister who continued to preach against rebellion while the troops of Bonnie Prince Charlie were occupying the town. When, in 1747, the Associate Synod, by a narrow majority, decided not to give full immediate effect to a judgment which had been passed in the previous year against the lawfulness of the Burgess Oath, Gib led the protesting minority, who broke off and formed the Antiburgher Synod (10 April) in his own house in Edinburgh.

It was chiefly through Gib&#x27;s influence that the Antiburghers decided, at subsequent meetings, to summon to the bar their Burgher brethren, and to depose and excommunicate them for contumacy. Gib&#x27;s action in forming the Antiburgher Synod led, after prolonged litigation, to his exclusion from the building in Bristo Street where his congregation had met. In 1765 he made his response to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which had stigmatized the Secession as threatening the peace of the country. From 1753 till within a short period of his death, he preached regularly in Nicolson Street Church, which was constantly filled with an audience of two thousand persons. His dogmatic and fearless attitude in controversy earned for him the nickname Pope Gib.

He died on 14 June 1788 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh on 18 June. The grave lies on the south-facing section of the western wall within the original graveyard. He is buried with his wife Emilia MacGeorge and his daughters.

==Life==
Adam Gib was a Scottish Antiburgher divine, the ninth son of John Gib. He was born at Cowden Castle, his father&#x27;s property, in the parish of Muckhart, Perthshire, on 7 April 1714. His mother&#x27;s name was Helen Bogie.

Adam was educated at the University of Edinburgh. His first serious impressions were caused by his unexpectedly witnessing the execution of a criminal in the Grassmarket. While he was attending the undergraduate classes the controversy was going on in the general assembly which led to the formation of the secession church under Ebenezer Erskine and others, and Gib was so impressed with the harsh treatment of the seceders, that he threw in his lot with them. His father was at first extremely displeased with him, but was afterwards reconciled; and as his eldest son was a prodigal he settled on Adam the succession to the estate. When the will was read Adam asked his brother if he would reform, and on his promising to do so put the will into the fire. Gib joined the ‘Associate Presbytery’ founded by Erskine and others in 1735, and was licensed to the West Kirk of Stirling on 5 March 1740. In 1741 he was ordained to the charge of the Secession congregation in Bristo Street, Edinburgh. In 1745, when Edinburgh fell into the hands of the Pretender, Gib displayed courage. Most of the presbyterian ministers had fled from the city. Gib, however, withdrew with his flock only to the suburbs, and for five Sundays at Dreghorn, near Colinton, three miles from Edinburgh, where the insurgents had a guard, he spoke voice against the &quot;popish pretender&quot; and his cause. He prayed for George II, for the preservation of the Protestant succession, and for the suppression of the rebellion. The services were conducted in the open air, and among the audience were sometimes some of the Pretender&#x27;s soldiers. Gib took prisoner a rebel spy a few hours before the Battle of Falkirk; but when searched for he could not be found.

About 1747, among the Seceders a dispute arose about the lawfulness of an oath to be taken by burgesses or burghers. Gib took the side of those who deemed the oath unlawful, and ultimately became the leader of the Antiburgher section of the Secession Church. The antiburgher synod was constituted in his house at Edinburgh 10 April 1747. This involved him and his flock in litigation over Bristo Church. Gib stuck to the building for years, after decisions had been given against him. His congregation built a meeting-place for him in Nicolson Street, where he ministered till near his death, which took place at Edinburgh on 18 June 1788. He was succeeded as minister by John Jamieson.

All his life Gib was an active controversialist. Rude, scornful, and despotic, he earned for himself the nickname &quot;Pope Gib&quot;.

<text>The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is a transliteration scheme that allows the lossless romanisation of Indic scripts as employed by Sanskrit and related Indic languages. It is based on a scheme that emerged during the 19th century from suggestions by Charles Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress, in September 1894. IAST makes it possible for the reader to read the Indic text unambiguously, exactly as if it were in the original Indic script. It is this faithfulness to the original scripts that accounts for its continuing popularity amongst scholars.

==Usage==
Scholars commonly use IAST in publications that cite textual material in Sanskrit, Pāḷi and other classical Indian languages.

IAST is also used for major e-text repositories such as SARIT, Muktabodha, GRETIL, and sanskritdocuments.org.

The IAST scheme represents more than a century of scholarly usage in books and journals on classical Indian studies. By contrast, the ISO 15919 standard for transliterating Indic scripts emerged in 2001 from the standards and library worlds. For the most part, ISO 15919 follows the IAST scheme, departing from it only in minor ways (e.g., ḷ/l̥ and ṛ/r̥)—see comparison below.

The Indian National Library at Kolkata romanization, intended for the romanisation of all Indic scripts, is an extension of IAST.

==History==
The Tenth International Congress of Orientalists, held at Geneva on 10 September 1894, adopted the following notations:

For the short e and o, the Committee also recommended the use of ĕ and ŏ, respectively.

==Inventory and conventions==
The IAST letters are listed with their Devanagari equivalents and phonetic values in IPA, valid for Sanskrit, Hindi and other modern languages that use Devanagari script, but some phonological changes have occurred:


* &quot;H&quot; is actually glottal, not velar.

Some letters are modified with diacritics: Long vowels are marked with an overline (often called a macron). Vocalic (syllabic) consonants, retroflexes and ṣ () have an underdot. Two letters have an overdot: ṁ and ṅ (). One has an acute accent: ś (). One letter has a line below: ḻ () (Vedic).

Unlike ASCII-only romanisations such as ITRANS or Harvard-Kyoto, the diacritics used for IAST allow capitalisation of proper names. The capital variants of letters never occurring word-initially () are useful only when writing in all-caps and in Pāṇini contexts for which the convention is to typeset the &quot;IT&quot; sounds as capital letters.

==Comparison with ISO 15919==
For the most part, IAST is a subset of ISO 15919 that merges the retroflex (underdotted) liquids with the vocalic ones (ringed below) and the short close-mid vowels with the long ones. The following seven exceptions are from the ISO standard accommodating an extended repertoire of symbols to allow transliteration of Devanāgarī and other Indic scripts, as used for languages other than Sanskrit.

== Computer input by alternative keyboard layout==
The most convenient method of inputting romanized Sanskrit is by setting up an alternative keyboard layout. This allows one to hold a modifier key to type letters with diacritical marks. For example, = ā. How this is set up varies by operating system.

Linux/Unix and BSD desktop environments allow one to set up custom keyboard layouts and switch them by clicking a flag icon in the menu bar.

macOS One can use the pre-installed US International keyboard, or install Toshiya Unebe&#x27;s Easy Unicode keyboard layout.

Microsoft Windows 
Windows also allows one to change keyboard layouts and set up additional custom keyboard mappings for IAST. This Pali keyboard installer made by Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) supports IAST (works on Microsoft Windows up to at least version 10, can use Alt button on the right side of the keyboard instead of Ctrl+Alt combination).

== Computer input by selection from a screen==

Many systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. ISO/IEC 14755 refers to this as a &quot;screen-selection entry method&quot;.

Microsoft Windows has provided a Unicode version of the Character Map program (find it by hitting then type codice_1 then hit ) since version NT 4.0 – appearing in the consumer edition since XP. This is limited to characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). Characters are searchable by Unicode character name, and the table can be limited to a particular code block. More advanced third-party tools of the same type are also available (a notable freeware example is BabelMap).

macOS provides a &quot;character palette&quot; with much the same functionality, along with searching by related characters, glyph tables in a font, etc. It can be enabled in the input menu in the menu bar under System Preferences → International → Input Menu (or System Preferences → Language and Text → Input Sources) or can be viewed under Edit → Emoji &amp; Symbols in many programs.

Equivalent tools – such as gucharmap (GNOME) or kcharselect (KDE) – exist on most Linux desktop environments.

Users of SCIM on Linux based platforms can also have the opportunity to install and use the sa-itrans-iast input handler which provides complete support for the ISO 15919 standard for the romanization of Indic languages as part of the m17n library.

Or user can use some Unicode characters in Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended Additional and Combining Diarcritical Marks block to write IAST.

== Font support ==
Only certain fonts support all the Latin Unicode characters essential for the transliteration of Indic scripts according to the IAST and ISO 15919 standards.

For example, the Arial, Tahoma and Times New Roman font packages that come with Microsoft Office 2007 and later versions also support precomposed Unicode characters like &quot;ī&quot;.

Many other text fonts commonly used for book production may be lacking in support for one or more characters from this block. Accordingly, many academics working in the area of Sanskrit studies make use of free OpenType fonts such as FreeSerif or Gentium, both of which have complete support for the full repertoire of conjoined diacritics in the IAST character set. Released under the GNU FreeFont or SIL Open Font License, respectively, such fonts may be freely shared and do not require the person reading or editing a document to purchase proprietary software to make use of its associated fonts.

<doc id="557100" wikidata="Q1356563" url="?curid=557100" title="Jesse B. Oldendorf">
<text>Jesse Barrett &quot;Oley&quot; Oldendorf (16 February 1887 – 27 April 1974) was an admiral in the United States Navy, famous for defeating a Japanese force in the Battle of Leyte Gulf during World War II. He also served as commander of the American naval forces during the early phase of the Battle of the Caribbean. In early 1942, a secret group of senior Navy officers empaneled by President Franklin D. Roosevelt assessed him as one of the 40 most competent of the 120 flag officers in the Navy.

==Early life==
Jesse Barrett Oldendorf was born in Riverside, California on 16 February 1887. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1909, standing 141st in a class of 174, and was commissioned in 1911. His Academy classmates included Admiral Alan G. Kirk and Vice Admirals Olaf M. Hustveldt and Theodore S. Wilkinson. Oldendorf served aboard the armored cruiser , the torpedo boat destroyer , the cruiser , the destroyer and the armored cruiser &quot;California&quot; again, although she had been renamed &quot;San Diego&quot;. He also served on the Panama Canal hydrographic survey ship .

==World War I==
During World War I, Oldendorf spent a few months on recruiting duty in Philadelphia. From June to August 1917, he commanded the naval armed guard on . The ship sank as a result of a collision in New York. He then became a gunnery officer aboard the troop transport , which was sunk by three torpedoes from the German submarine &quot;U-90&quot; off Ireland on 31 May 1918. From August 1918 to March 1919, he was engineering officer of . In July, he was briefly executive officer of .

==Between the wars==
Between the great wars, Oldendorf did a stint in charge of recruiting station Pittsburgh, acted as an engineering inspector in Baltimore, and served as officer in charge of a hydrographic office. In 1920, he was assigned to the patrol yacht . From 1921 to 1922, Oldendorf was stationed on in the Caribbean, while acting as flag secretary to Special Service Squadron commanders Rear Admiral Casey B. Morgan, Captain Austin Kautz and Rear Admiral William C. Cole. From 1922 to 1924 he served as aide to Rear Admiral Josiah S. McKean, commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard. In 1925, Oldendorf, now a commander, assumed his first command, the destroyer , Afterwards, he was aide to successive commandants of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Rear Admiral Thomas P. Magruder and Julian Lane Latimer from 1927 to 1928.

Oldendorf attended the Naval War College from 1928 to 1929 and then the Army War College from 1929 to 1930. From 1930 to 1935, he was the navigator of the battleship . Following the normal pattern of alternating duty at sea with shore duty, Oldendorf taught navigation at the Naval Academy from 1932 to 1935. Following this teaching assignment at the Academy, Oldendorf returned to sea duty serving as executive officer of the battleship from 1935 to 1937. From 1937 to 1939, Oldendorf directed the recruiting section of the Bureau of Navigation.

==World War II==
From 1939 to 1941, Oldendorf commanded the cruiser . In September 1941, he joined the staff of the Naval War College, where he taught navigation until February 1942. On 31 March 1942, Oldendorf was promoted to rear admiral, and assigned to the Aruba-Curaçao sector of the Caribbean Sea Frontier. In August 1942, he was transferred to the Trinidad sector where anti-submarine warfare was his primary duty. From May through December 1943, Oldendorf commanded Task Force 24 which was assigned all Western Atlantic escorts. His flagships during this period were destroyer tender and fleet tug .

Oldendorf was reassigned to the United States Pacific Fleet in January 1944, where he commanded Cruiser Division 4 (CruDiv 4) from his flagship . Cruiser Division 4, consisting of cruisers and battleships, supported carrier operations and provided fire support for the landings in the Marshalls, Palaus, Marianas, and Leyte.

On 12 September 1944, Oldendorf commanded from the bridge of his flagship, , the Fire Support Group tasked with the bombardment of Peleliu in the Palaus island group. This Fire Support Group consisted of five battleships, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, , , , and , eight cruisers, twelve destroyers, seven minesweepers, fifteen landing craft converted to rocket launchers, and a half-dozen submarines. At this point in his career, Oldendorf was an experienced battle commander who had handled similar assignments in three previous Marine landings. The bombardment was scheduled to last three days. By the end of the first day, aerial reconnaissance photos indicated that close to 300 of the assigned targets had been destroyed or seriously damaged by the all-day bombardment and that virtually every aboveground structure and fortification had been eradicated. At the airport its few usable planes were reduced to wreckage.

By the evening of the second day, every target specified on the master list in &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;″s combat center had been struck repeatedly. However, Oldendorf was concerned because no return fire had been detected from the concentrations of enemy heavy artillery shown in earlier aerial reconnaissance photos and because the latest photos contained no evidence that these weapons had been destroyed. It was surmised that the Japanese had moved their heavy artillery underground where they could have survived the bombardment. Despite these concerns, Oldendorf made the decision to call off the bombardment at the end of the second day of a pre-arranged schedule that called for a third full day of attacks.

This would have tragic results for the 1st Marines&#x27; beach assault on Peleliu because the white coral outcropping designated as &quot;the Point&quot; was left virtually untouched despite the specific request that Lieutenant Colonel Lewis &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, commander of the 1st Marines, made to Oldendorf&#x27;s staff to target it in the Navy&#x27;s bombardment. &quot;The Point&quot; commanded the heights 30 feet above the north end of White Beach 1 on which the 1st Marines landed and was considered by Puller to be a potential defensive strongpoint too obvious for the Japanese to overlook. The result of not sufficiently reducing &quot;the Point&quot; was a bloodbath. Over 500 men were lost, roughly one-sixth of its regimental strength, on the D-Day White Beach assault on Peleliu, and the entire beachhead was in danger of collapsing. It was only by the heroism of the Marines that &quot;the Point&quot; was taken. After the war when asked about Pelilieu, Oldendorf commented that &quot;If military leaders-and that includes Navy brass-were gifted with the same accuracy of foresight that they are with hindsight, then the assault of Peleliu should never have been attempted.&quot;


On 24 October 1944, Oldendorf was the commander of Task Group 77.2 at the Battle of Surigao Strait. From aboard his flagship USS &quot;Louisville&quot; he led the defeat of the Japanese Southern Force. He deployed his powerful force of battleships and cruisers in a classic battle line formation across the Surigao Strait, crossing the T of his opponent. The Japanese battleships and were sunk, and Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura was killed. Oldendorf&#x27;s action prevented the Japanese from bringing their battle fleet into Surigao Strait and attacking the beachheads on Leyte Island. He later explained his tactics to the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;My theory was that of the old-time gambler: Never give a sucker a chance.&quot; For this action, Oldendorf was awarded the Navy Cross. In 1959 Admiral Oldendorf provided commentary on his planning for the battle:

On 15 December 1944, Oldendorf was promoted to vice admiral and made commander of Battleship Squadron 1. He commanded battleships in the landings at Lingayen. On 6 January 1945, Oldendorf, together with his guest British admiral Bruce Fraser, survived a destructive &quot;kamikaze&quot; strike on the bridge of . He was wounded breaking his collar bone at Ulithi on 11 March 1945, when his barge hit a buoy. Oldendorf assumed command of Task Force 95 in July, and led this force on two sweeps of the East China Sea. He was wounded, breaking several ribs, when his flagship &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was torpedoed by a Japanese aircraft on 12 August 1945. On 22 September 1945, Oldendorf commanded the occupation of Wakayama and dictated terms of surrender to Vice Admiral Hoka and Rear Admiral Yofai.

==Post-World War II life==
From November 1945, Oldendorf commanded the 11th Naval District. In 1946 he assumed command of the San Diego Naval Base. From 1947 until his retirement in 1948 he commanded the Western Sea Frontier and the United States Navy reserve fleets at San Francisco. He retired in September 1948 at which time he was promoted to Admiral.

Oldendorf resided in Mount Vernon, Virginia, where he owned a large plot of land. He died on 27 April 1974 in Portsmouth, Virginia. The destroyer was named in his honor.

<doc id="557110" wikidata="Q223181" url="?curid=557110" title="Queen II">
<text>Queen II is the second studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 8 March 1974 by EMI Records in the UK and 
Elektra Records in the US. It was recorded at Trident Studios and Langham 1 Studios, London, in August 1973 with co-producers Roy Thomas Baker and Robin Geoffrey Cable, and engineered by Mike Stone. It is significant for being the first album to contain elements of the band&#x27;s signature sound of multi-layered overdubs, vocal harmonies, and varied musical styles.

Described as &quot;arguably the heaviest Queen album&quot;, &quot;Queen II&quot; marked the end of the first phase of the band&#x27;s career. The album combines a heavy rock sound with art rock and progressive rock elements, and has been called &quot;a pillar of grandiose, assaultive hard rock&quot; by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &quot;Queen II&quot; is a concept album set in the same medieval faery-realm as their first album, following a royal line&#x27;s magical battle against forces of darkness. The two sides of the original LP were labelled &quot;Side White&quot; and &quot;Side Black&quot; (instead of the conventional sides A and B), with corresponding photos of the band dressed in black on the front cover and white on the inner gatefold. The white side has songs with a more emotional theme and the black side is almost entirely about fantasy, often with quite dark themes. Mick Rock&#x27;s cover photograph was frequently re-used by the band throughout its career, including the music videos for the songs &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (1975) and &quot;One Vision&quot; (1985).

Released to an initially mixed critical reception, &quot;Queen II&quot; remains one of the band&#x27;s lesser-known albums. Nonetheless, it has retained a cult following since its release, and garnered praise from critics, fans, and fellow musicians alike.

==Background and recording==

Queen performed their first gig on 27 June 1970, but did not finish their self-titled debut album, &quot;Queen&quot;, until November 1972. In the interim, the band had developed other, more complex material but elected to wait to record it until they had more freedom and experience in the studio. &quot;Father To Son&quot;, &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; and &quot;Procession&quot; had all been premiered as early as 1972. &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; dated to Freddie Mercury&#x27;s Wreckage days in 1969. &quot;See What a Fool I&#x27;ve Been&quot;, the B-side to the &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; single and &quot;White Queen (As It Began)&quot; were left over from the Smile days. &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, also from Mercury&#x27;s Wreckage period, had been in the set list for years, but was held back and reworked for the third album, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;. Portions of &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; were also rehearsed during the &quot;Queen II&quot; sessions, but the song was not completed until the fourth album, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. Queen insisted that Trident Studios allow them to record at regular hours instead of studio down-time, as they had for the first album. The band approached David Bowie to produce, but he declined because he was then recording &quot;Pin Ups&quot; and working on songs for &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. Robin Geoffrey Cable, with whom Mercury had worked during the &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; session, was asked to produce &quot;Nevermore&quot; and &quot;Funny How Love Is&quot;, and collaborate with Roy Thomas Baker on the ambitious &quot;March of the Black Queen&quot;.

After the commercial failure of the single &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; from the first album, Queen decided it needed a single that did not take &quot;too long to happen&quot; (i.e., without a lengthy guitar intro). &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;, recorded with the specific intention of being the album&#x27;s leading single, began in a way designed to grab attention. Rehearsals for the &quot;Queen II&quot; sessions commenced on or around 26 July. (Due to management problems, the first album was finally released as the band prepared to record &quot;Queen II&quot;.) During these rehearsals, the band were interviewed by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and told the magazine that their new album would have a theme of &quot;good versus evil&quot;. The band also ended its collaboration with John Anthony, who had co-produced the first album, due to clashes between Mercury and Anthony. On 3 August, the band performed at a gig in Newcastle, then returned to London for a pre-recording rehearsal on 4 August. Sessions began on 5 August with takes 1–12 of the finished version of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;. On 6 August, they started recording &quot;Father To Son&quot;, working on takes 1–4. They continued to work on the album until 9 August, when they made promotional videos for &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; and &quot;Liar&quot; from the debut album.

According to the August 11 issue of &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, the band was scheduled to go back into the studio on 15 August. However, David Bowie and Ken Scott were producing &quot;Pin Ups&quot; in the studio Queen had been using. The band were put into Studio 2, with producer Robin Geoffrey Cable. Although this studio only had an 8-track tape machine at the time, Queen decided to work on backing tracks nonetheless. Takes of &quot;Nevermore&quot; were recorded that day, and &quot;Funny How Love Is&quot; was recorded on 16 August. Queen had to cancel a studio session on 17 August to perform a gig in Peterborough. They returned to London around 3:00 a.m. Roy Thomas Baker had also left (around 12–18 August) to work with a Danish client named Gasolin&#x27;, who were recording their album &quot;Gasolin&#x27; 3&quot;. On 18 August, Queen, Baker and Cable recorded the complex backing track for &quot;The March Of The Black Queen&quot;. After taking a break for a bank holiday, the band began principal overdubbing on 28 August. Some backing tracks had to be cut into separate multi-tracks because of the extensive overdubbing. (The album&#x27;s working title became &quot;Over The Top&quot; in reference to overdubbing.) During this period, John Deacon had to do his summer exams. In September, Brian recorded &quot;Procession,&quot; which had its live premiere on 13 September when the band played at the Golders Green Hippodrome in London. (This was also their first recorded concert.)

On 24 September the band did their first radio interview with Bob Harris. In early October, Queen met with photographer Mick Rock for the first time to discuss album concept art. They took a short break starting on 12 October to begin a promotional tour around Europe. On 18 October, the band returned to London to continue work on the album. On 3 November, Queen had their first publicity shoot with Mick Rock, producing the album&#x27;s iconic cover image. Queen took another break from recording in November to tour with Mott The Hoople. Rehearsals began on 5 November and the tour started in Blackburn on 13 November. The band would come near London a few times in early December, and popped into the studio on their days off. The tour ended at the Hammersmith Odeon on 14 December, followed by a standalone gig at Leicester University on 15 December. Rough mixing for the album commenced on 17 December. Martin Hayman of &quot;Sounds&quot; visited the band on 22 December while they were finishing rough mixes for &quot;Loser In The End&quot;, &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;, and &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot;.

Queen went back into the studio in early January. At this point, all of the rough mixes had been finished, and the band were ready to move onto the final stages of production. According to studio documentation, most of the songs were mixed by 19 January, but still required equalization. Brian had also contracted gangrene from a tainted inoculation needle in mid-December, and couldn&#x27;t attend some sessions. The band flew to Australia on 25 January and performed to an unruly crowd on 27 January that led to the band to storm off stage halfway through their set. On 31 January, Queen returned to London to complete the album. The last pressings were made on 20 February.

==Songs==
===Overview===
The music of &quot;Queen II&quot; has been attributed to several genres, including art rock, hard rock, glam rock, heavy metal, and progressive rock. Music journalist and author Jerry Ewing described the album as displaying a &quot;proggy art rock tendency&quot;. Daniel Ross of &quot;The Quietus&quot; described it as &quot;the exact intersection&quot; between the band&#x27;s &quot;murky, metallic beginnings&quot; and &quot;the absolute pop perfection incarnation of Queen, leather trousers and Formby pastiches.&quot;

Rather than the conventional Side 1 and Side 2, the album was split into &quot;Side White&quot; and &quot;Side Black&quot;, dominated by May and Mercury compositions respectively. Although some have interpreted it as a concept album, Queen biographer Georg Purvis stated that it is &quot;not a concept album but a collection of songs with a loose theme running throughout.&quot; Mercury later confirmed this in a 1976 &quot;Sounds&quot; interview, citing that &quot;it just evolved to where there was a batch of songs that could be considered aggressive, or a Black Side, and there was a smoother side&quot;.

The &quot;White&quot; side is very diverse: four of the five numbers were composed by Brian May, one of which is an instrumental. Freddie Mercury sings two songs; May sings one; and Roger Taylor sings the closing track, which is his only composition on the album. John Deacon played acoustic guitar on &quot;Father to Son&quot; in addition to normal duties on bass guitar. Mercury composed and sang all six songs on the &quot;Black&quot; side.

===Side White===
====&quot;Procession&quot;====
&quot;Procession&quot; is a short instrumental piece (a funeral march) performed by Brian May on multi-tracked guitar. He recorded it by playing overlapping parts on the Red Special through John Deacon&#x27;s custom-made amplifier (the Deacy Amp). Roger Taylor also contributes to this instrumental, using only a bass drum pedal.

====&quot;Father to Son&quot;====

&quot;Father to Son&quot; was written by May and features heavy metal sections as well as quiet piano parts, in which both May and Mercury played. Like &quot;Procession&quot;, &quot;Father to Son&quot; has parts with May on multi-tracked guitar played through the Deacy Amp. It is written from the father&#x27;s perspective when talking or thinking about his son. Queen immediately added &quot;Father to Son&quot; to their live setlists. In 1975, it was dropped from live shows, but revived a few times in 1976. The song covers a two-octave range: Mercury (G3-A4), Taylor (G4-A5).

====&quot;White Queen (As It Began)&quot;====
Written by May in 1968, this song features contrasting acoustic and heavy metal sections. May explained that he conceived the idea for this song while reading &quot;The White Goddess&quot; by Robert Graves. The song also had personal significance for May; he drew inspiration from a fellow student whom he revered and thought represented the idea of the &quot;perfect woman&quot;. In a later interview he said, &quot;I remember being totally in love with this girl from biology, and I never ever talked to her...I [was] dared to ask out this girl, and she became a lifelong friend, it&#x27;s very strange...&quot;. The song features May playing his Hairfred acoustic guitar. The guitar had been given a replacement hardwood bridge, chiselled flat, with a small piece of fret wire placed between it and the strings, which lay gently above. The strings produce the buzzing effect of a sitar.

&quot;White Queen&quot; was performed regularly between 1974 and 1977, and last performed in London in 1978. The live version usually included a long instrumental break with Mercury on piano that was not part of, or omitted from, the album version.

====&quot;Some Day One Day&quot;====
This is the first Queen song to feature May on lead vocals throughout. It also features May on acoustic guitar and electric guitar and the last guitar solo (during the fade-out) features three solo guitars. This kind of complex guitar arrangement is typical of May; however, usually the guitars are harmonious, but in this case, all of the guitars play different parts.

====&quot;The Loser in the End&quot;====
&quot;The Loser in the End&quot; was Taylor&#x27;s sole contribution on the album both as a songwriter and lead vocalist. The original handwritten lyrics of the song, which were nearly shredded in 2004, are the oldest example of handwritten lyrics in the Queen archive.

===Side Black===
====&quot;Ogre Battle&quot;====
Mercury wrote &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; on guitar (as confirmed by May in several interviews) in 1971 and it was one of the earliest songs in the Queen set list despite not being recorded until the &quot;Queen II&quot; sessions. The band waited until they could have more studio freedom to do it properly.

The song is one of Queen&#x27;s heaviest works. The guitar riff and Taylor&#x27;s drumming give it a very &quot;thrash&quot; sound. The ogre-like screams in the middle are Mercury&#x27;s, and the high harmonies at the end of the chorus hook are sung by Taylor. As the title suggests, it tells the story of a battle between ogres, and features a May guitar solo and sound effects to simulate the sounds of a battle. The opening of the song is actually the end of the song played in reverse.

A version of &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; was recorded in December 1973 for the BBC Radio 1 &quot;Sound of the 70s&quot; programme. An acetate was made of an edited version of the BBC recording without the long intro or any of the sound effects in the album version, potentially for release as a second single. However, other sources state that &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot; was also considered for the second single.

&quot;Ogre Battle&quot; was a staple of the band&#x27;s live set up to and including the A Day at the Races Tour, and was only played a couple more times on the North American leg of the News of the World Tour before being dropped from the set for good.

====&quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot;====

Mercury was inspired by Richard Dadd&#x27;s painting &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot; at the Tate Gallery in London. The fantasy-based lyrics make direct reference to characters and vignettes detailed in the painting and in Dadd&#x27;s companion poem, &quot;Elimination of a Picture &amp; its Subject—called The Feller&#x27;s Master Stroke.&quot; Characters include Queen Mab, Waggoner Will, the Tatterdemalion, and others. The use of the word &quot;quaere&quot; in the twice-repeated line &quot;What a quaere fellow&quot; has no reference to Mercury&#x27;s sexuality, according to Roger Taylor.

In some markets the album included a fold-out cover with a reproduction of the painting. Author Neil Gaiman wrote about the painting and the album on his blog:
 Gaiman wrote a longer essay about the painting for &quot;Intelligent Life&quot;.

For the intricately arranged studio recording, Mercury played harpsichord as well as piano, and Roy Thomas Baker played the castanets. Taylor called this song Queen&#x27;s &quot;biggest stereo experiment&quot;, referring to the use of panning in the mix.

The song was performed only a few times during the Queen II Tour, and there was thought to be no live recording of the song until 2014, when it was released on &quot;Live at the Rainbow &#x27;74&quot;.

====&quot;Nevermore&quot;====
The previous track ends with a three-part vocal harmony from Mercury, May, and Taylor which flows into Mercury playing the piano. This piano carries on to open this track making &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;, &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot; and the current track, into a medley. All the vocal parts were performed by Mercury, who added some contemporary piano &quot;ring&quot; effects as well. These effects were widely suspected to be synthesisers; however, they were created by someone plucking the piano strings while Mercury played the notes. &quot;Nevermore&quot; is a short ballad written by Mercury about the feelings after a heartbreak.

====&quot;The March of the Black Queen&quot;====
Mercury had been working on this song even before Queen formed. In a 1974 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, he said, &quot;... that song took me ages to complete. I wanted to give it everything, to be self-indulgent or whatever.&quot; The multifaceted composition, the band&#x27;s second longest (6:34), is one of two Queen songs (the other being &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;) containing polyrhythm/polymeter (two different time signatures simultaneously 8/8 and 12/8) and a simpler polyrhythm around the end uptempo section, which is very rare for popular music. The lead vocals cover two and a half octaves (G2 – C5).

May regards it as a precursor to &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, stating, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to bear in mind that we&#x27;d already made &#x27;My Fairy King&#x27; on the first album and we&#x27;d done &#x27;The March of the Black Queen&#x27; on the second album, so we were well in tune with Freddie&#x27;s excursions into strange areas, and that was something that we really enjoyed.&quot; Taylor recalled in a 1977 interview, &quot;The tape went transparent, genuinely... It was 16-track... The tape had gone over the (recording) head so many times, overdubbing, that the oxide had worn off.&quot; A similar anecdote is told about the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; sessions.

Despite never being released as a single, it remains a favourite amongst Queen&#x27;s fans. The full piece was too complicated to be performed live; however, the uptempo section containing the lines &quot;My life is in your hands, I&#x27;ll foe and I&#x27;ll fie...&quot; etc. was sometimes included in a live medley, with vocals by Mercury and Taylor, during the 1970s. The opening piano piece is only known to have been played live once, at Providence Civic Center on 14 November 1978 (likely in response to a fan shouting for the song near the beginning of the concert). After playing the intro the band quickly transitioned into &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. This was also the final time a &quot;Queen II&quot; track would be played live until the revival of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; in 1984 for &quot;The Works&quot; Tour.

This song ends with an ascending note progression, which climaxes in the first second of the following track. The song segues into the next track, &quot;Funny How Love Is&quot;.

====&quot;Funny How Love Is&quot;====
&quot;Funny How Love Is&quot; was created in the studio. Mercury wrote it and played the piano while Robin Cable produced. It was produced using the &quot;wall of sound&quot; technique. The song was never performed live, largely due to the demanding high-register vocals from Mercury throughout the song.

====&quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;====

Mercury began developing &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; in 1969 when he was with the band Wreckage. He eventually fleshed the song out with contributions from May. In the documentary &quot;Queen: Days of Our Lives&quot;, May recalled, &quot;I&#x27;ve probably never spoken about this before, ever, but I remember &#x27;Seven Seas of Rhye&#x27; being—it was Freddie&#x27;s idea. He had this lovely little riff idea on the piano, and I think all the middle eighth is stuff that I did. So we definitely worked on it together. But when it came to the album coming out, Freddie went, &#x27;I wrote that.&#x27; And we all went, &#x27;Okay.&#x27; (Laughs) Because it didn&#x27;t seem like that big a deal. But Freddie said, &#x27;You know, I wrote the words and it was my idea, so it&#x27;s my song.&#x27; The sort of unwritten law was the person who brought the song in would get the credit for writing that song, and the money for writing that song. Much, much later in Queen history, we recognized this fact.&quot;

Along with &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; from &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;, the song references a fantasy world or kingdom named Rhye. &quot;It&#x27;s really fictitious,&quot; Mercury told interviewer Tom Browne in 1977. &quot;It&#x27;s a figment of your imagination.&quot; A short, instrumental version of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; was included as the outro on their first album, with the intent of starting this album with the full version. A similar idea occurred with the old music hall song &quot;I Do Like To Be Beside the Seaside&quot;, which is sung at the end of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; here and whistled during the intro to the third album, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;. Ken Testi recalled, &quot;I joined in on the reprise at the end of &#x27;Seven Seas of Rhye&#x27;. So did Pat McConnell and a whole bunch of us. I recall an awful lot of reverb, and Brian played the stylophone on it, but it was done in one day and we were all totally pissed at the time.&quot;

&quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; features a distinctive arpeggiated piano introduction. On the &quot;Queen II&quot; recording, the arpeggios are played with both hands, an octave apart, whereas on the abbreviated &quot;Queen&quot; recording, and most live performances, Mercury played the simpler one-handed version of these arpeggios. The theme also appears at the end of &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day (reprise)&quot; on the band&#x27;s final album &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; (1995).

==Artwork and packaging==
Rock photographer Mick Rock was engaged to create the album&#x27;s artwork. In Rock&#x27;s words, the band wanted to &quot;graft some of [the trademark] decadent &#x27;glam&#x27; sensibility&quot; of his previous work with artists such as David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. According to Rock, Queen were looking to grab people&#x27;s attention with the cover, especially since their first album had failed to do so. &quot;They realised that if you could catch people&#x27;s eyes you could get them interested in the music.&quot;

The brief he received from the band conceived a black and white theme for the album. The cover features a photograph described by VH1 as &quot;Queen standing in diamond formation, heads tilted back like Easter Island statues&quot; against a black background. The iconic chiaroscuro image of Queen was inspired by a similar photograph of Marlene Dietrich from the 1932 film &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;. &quot;And of course no one was ever more &#x27;glam&#x27; than the divine Ms Dietrich,&quot; Rock quipped. &quot;It was just one of those flashes of inspiration that happens sometimes,&quot; Rock explained. &quot;There was a feeling that [echoing the Dietrich pose] might be pretentious,&quot; but Rock convinced the band otherwise. &quot;It made them look like much bigger a deal than they were at the time, but it was a true reflection of their music.&quot; Rock stated Mercury loved to quote Oscar Wilde. &quot;Often, that which today is considered pretentious is tomorrow considered state of the art. The important thing is to be considered.&quot; Rock added, &quot;To Freddie, that word [pretentious] was meaningless – &#x27;But is it fabulous?&#x27; was all that mattered. Those were the days of androgyny, and Freddie was prepared to push it quite a way&quot;. Freddie added, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have any special meaning, but we were fascinated with this type of thing, and the wardrobe we used at the time described it perfectly well&quot;. The image would later be brought to life for the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; music video.

To expand on the black and white theme, Rock made a second image of the band, dressed in white against a white background, that was used in the album&#x27;s gatefold, advertising, and the &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; single sleeve.

==Release==
After the album&#x27;s completion at the end of August 1973, Queen immediately added &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;, &quot;Procession&quot; and &quot;Father to Son&quot; to their live set lists and toured extensively. Once again, however, EMI delayed the album&#x27;s release since the first album had only just been issued in the UK and had yet to be released in the US. Other problems beset the album&#x27;s release: the energy conservation measures put in place during the 1973 oil crisis delayed its manufacture by several months; then, when released, John Deacon was credited as &quot;Deacon John&quot;, and the band insisted it had to be corrected.

&quot;Queen II&quot; was released on 8 March 1974. The album enjoyed chart success in the UK, peaking at number five. It peaked at number 49 in the US, improving on their debut album &quot;Queen&quot;, which peaked at number 83. In interviews the group promoted the album with a theme of &quot;good versus evil,&quot; and made numerous public appearances to gain exposure: aside from touring in 1973, they performed BBC specials, broadcast a gig at Golders Green Hippodrome on &quot;In Concert&quot; and appeared on John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Sound of the Seventies&quot;. However, despite the publicity, the group received negative reviews from the media, who criticised the band for being &quot;excessive and self indulgent.&quot;

&quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;, along with the non-album B-side &quot;See What a Fool I&#x27;ve Been&quot;, was released as a single sooner than planned due to a fortuitous circumstance. In February 1974, David Bowie was unable to appear on the show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to perform &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, and a replacement act was urgently needed. Queen were booked for the show and lip-synched &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;. EMI then rushed the single into release on 22 February, just five days after the television appearance was confirmed. It was the band&#x27;s first hit single, peaking at number 10 in the UK charts.

===2011 re-issue===
On 8 November 2010, record company Universal Music announced a remastered and expanded reissue of the album set for release in May 2011. This was as part of a new record deal between Queen and Universal Music, which meant Queen&#x27;s association with EMI Records would come to an end after almost 40 years. All of Queen&#x27;s studio albums were remastered and reissued in 2011.

==Reception==
===Contemporary critical reaction===
&quot;Disc&quot; wrote, &quot;The material, performance, recording and even artwork standards are very high.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; opined that the record showcased &quot;all their power and drive, their writing talents, and every quality that makes them unique,&quot; while &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote, &quot;Simply titled &quot;Queen II&quot;, this album captures them in their finest hours.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who had highly praised the band&#x27;s first album, awarded the album two-and-a-half stars out of five. While the magazine had little enthusiasm for &quot;Side Black&quot;, they applauded &quot;Side White&quot;, writing that it featured the &quot;saving grace of timely and well-chosen power chords and some rather pretty tunes.&quot;
&quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s reputed Queen have enjoyed some success in the States, it&#x27;s currently in the balance whether they&#x27;ll really break through here. If they do, then I&#x27;ll have to eat my hat or something. Maybe Queen try too hard, there&#x27;s no depth of sound or feeling.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; wrote, &quot;This is it, the dregs of glam rock. Weak and over-produced, if this band are our brightest hope for the future, then we are committing rock and roll suicide.&quot; Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, derisively referred to it as &quot;wimpoid royaloid heavyoid android void.&quot;

===Legacy===
As 1974 drew to a close, public reaction to &quot;Queen II&quot; had been enthusiastic. The album was also ranked by &quot;Disc&quot; as the 5th best of the year. While the album remains one of the band&#x27;s lesser-known works, it has since retained a cult following and has in recent years been cited by a number of music publications, fellow artists and fans as one of Queen&#x27;s finest works. In 1987, the &quot;Post-Tribune&quot; ranked &quot;Queen II&quot; 9th in an article covering &quot;albums that should be in everyone&#x27;s record collection, but aren&#x27;t.&quot; In the 1994 edition of The Guinness All Time Top 1000 Albums, &quot;Queen II&quot; was voted number 202 in the all-time greatest rock and pop albums. In 2003, &quot;Q magazine&quot; included &quot;Queen II&quot; in a list of fifty little-known albums recommended by the magazine to supplement their &quot;The 50 Best British Albums Ever&quot; poll. In 2005, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; readers voted &quot;Queen II&quot; the 72nd greatest British rock album ever. In 2006, the album was featured in &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;″s &quot;The 200 Greatest Albums of the 70s,&quot; being listed alongside &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; as one of the 20 greatest albums of 1974. In 2008, IGN named &quot;Queen II&quot; as one of their &quot;10 Classic Glam Rock Albums&quot;, writing, &quot;Queen gave glam a bigger, more anthemic sound with this glittery opus. Combined with Freddie Mercury&#x27;s underrated keyboard work, Brian May&#x27;s ringing leads and pristine riffs created a backdrop for songs that were by turns ferocious and elegant.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked &quot;Queen II&quot; as the 60th greatest album ever released on the Elektra label. Along with the Queen albums &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; and &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, &quot;Queen II&quot; is featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, where it is described as &quot;a distinctly dark album&quot; which &quot;displayed their diversity,&quot; and contrasted with their later &quot;expansive, stadium-pleasing anthems.&quot;

AllMusic awarded the album 4/5 stars and said, &quot;Queen is coiled, tense, and vicious here, delivering on their inherent sense of drama, and that gives &quot;Queen II&quot; real power as music, as well as a true cohesion&quot;. The review observed the album&#x27;s heaviness and stated &quot;this never feels as fantastical as Genesis or Uriah Heep&quot;, concluding &quot;&quot;Queen II&quot; is one of the favorites of their hardcore fans&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded the album a very positive rating of 8/10, writing, &quot;Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, &quot;Queen II&quot; is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band&#x27;s most underrated record.&quot; In 2009, &quot;The Quietus&quot; published an article highlighting Queen&#x27;s &quot;lesser-known brilliance&quot; to coincide with the release of that year&#x27;s &quot;Absolute Greatest&quot; compilation, describing &quot;Queen II&quot; as &quot;an absolute scorcher of an album&quot; which features two of the band&#x27;s best tracks: &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; and &quot;Father to Son&quot;. In 2014, Brian Moore wrote for &quot;Houston Press&quot; that &quot;the music is more progressive and the harmonies more advanced than anything from the first album. Queen had so exhausted themselves with the progressive rock style after recording this album that they abandoned the sound entirely for the next one.&quot; Writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked &quot;Queen II&quot; as the band&#x27;s sixth greatest album. He wrote: &quot;Stylistically there was nothing here that wasn&#x27;t on the superior debut, and you can hear the band struggling with the traditional &#x27;difficult second album&#x27; problems... They had pushed their rock and metal roots as far as they could, and were clearly looking to jump off the train and expand their horizons. It&#x27;s probably for this reason that the album lacked the sparkle and bite of &quot;Queen&quot; and the audacity of the subsequent &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;.&quot; Greg Kot of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; offered a plain favourable rating of 2 stars, commenting the album &quot;fused Led Zeppelin`s metallic stomp with Yes` baroque arrangements and topped it off with a dash of campiness.&quot;

Other rock musicians have praised the album. Rob Halford of Judas Priest cites &quot;Queen II&quot; as one of his favourite albums, saying it is &quot;nothing but good songs&quot; and stating &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; as a particular favourite. In a 1989 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Guns N&#x27; Roses lead singer Axl Rose said of the album, &quot;With Queen, I have my favorite: &quot;Queen II&quot;. Whenever their newest record would come out and have all these other kinds of music on it, at first I&#x27;d only like this song or that song. But after a period of time listening to it, it would open my mind up to so many different styles. I really appreciate them for that. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to achieve&quot;. Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx expressed his admiration in the same publication for the album, saying &quot;&quot;Queen II&quot; will knock your dick in the dirt every time&quot;. Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Billy Corgan spoke to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in August 1993 about &quot;the records which changed his life,&quot; stating, &quot;I worked at this record store where we had lots of old records, and I found &quot;Queen II&quot;, probably their least popular album. It&#x27;s so over the top, so many vocal and guitar track overdubs – total Queen overload. I loved it. I loved the cool, weird, ambiguous songs about Freddie&#x27;s sexuality and the way it shifts from heavy to beautiful ballads.&quot;

===Band appraisal===




==Track listing==
===Original release===
All lead vocals by Freddie Mercury unless noted. The band included the comment &quot;and nobody played synthesiser... again&quot; on the album sleeve, a purist principle of May&#x27;s, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects, produced by guitar and vocals, as synthesisers. Roger Taylor was credited as Roger Meddows-Taylor, his full name, but that was discontinued after this album.

<text>Ebenezer Erskine (22 June 1680 – 2 June 1754) was a Scottish minister whose actions led to the establishment of the Secession Church (formed by dissenters from the Church of Scotland).

==Early life==
Ebenezer&#x27;s father, Henry Erskine, served as minister at Cornhill-on-Tweed, Northumberland, but was ejected in 1662 under the Act of Uniformity and imprisoned for several years. Ebenezer and his brother Ralph were both born during this difficult period in their father&#x27;s life. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 Henry was appointed to the parish of Chirnside, Berwickshire.

In 1703, after studying at the University of Edinburgh, Ebenezer was ordained as minister of Portmoak, on the edges of Loch Leven in Kinross-shire. A year later, he married Alison Turpie. They remained in Portmoak for 28 years, until, in the autumn of 1731, he moved to the West Church in Stirling.

==Secession==

At the General Assembly of 1722, a group of men including Ebenezer had been rebuked and admonished for defending the doctrines contained in the book &quot;The Marrow of Modern Divinity&quot;. In 1733, a sermon he preached on lay patronage at the Synod of Perth led to new accusations being levelled against him. He was compelled to defend himself from rebuke by appealing to the General Assembly, but the Assembly supported his accusers. After fruitless attempts to obtain a hearing, he, along with William Wilson of Perth, Alexander Moncrieff of Abernethy and James Fisher of Kinclaven, was suspended from the ministry by the Commission of Assembly in November of that year.

In protest against this sentence, the suspended ministers constituted themselves as a separate church court, under the name the &quot;Associate Presbytery&quot;. In 1739 they were summoned to appear before the General Assembly, but did not attend because they did not acknowledge its authority. They were deposed by the Church of Scotland the following year.

In the following years a large number of people joined their communion. The Associate Presbytery remained united until 1747, when a division took place over how the church should respond to a new oath required of all burgesses. Erskine joined with the &quot;burgher&quot; section, becoming their professor of theology. He continued to preach to a large and influential congregation in Stirling until his death. He was a very popular preacher and a man of considerable force of character. He was noted for acting on principle with honesty and courage. In 1820 the burgher and anti-burgher sections of the Secession Church were reunited, followed, in 1847 by their union with the relief synod as the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland.

==Influence==
The majority of Erskine&#x27;s published works are sermons. His &quot;Life and Diary&quot; (edited by Donald Fraser) was published in 1840. His &quot;Works&quot; were published in 1785.

In the United States, part of the Associate Presbyterian Church united with most of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in 1782, forming the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. This denomination, which continues today, operates Erskine College and Seminary in Due West, South Carolina.

His teachings are also popular in the Dutch Reformed Church.

==Family==
His son-in-law Rev Robert Fisher (died 1775), married to his daughter Jean, was a minister in Glasgow.

==Free Gardener==
Erskine was a Free Gardener. He was Initiated in the Dunfermline Lodge of Free Gardeners in 1722 the same year as his patron, John Leslie, 8th Earl of Rothes.

It is worthy of note that after he became a Free Gardener his sermons began to include numerous horticultural allusions.

<doc id="557112" wikidata="Q1321234" url="?curid=557112" title="Threefold repetition">
<text>In chess, the threefold repetition rule states that a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game. The rule is also known as repetition of position and, in the USCF rules, as triple occurrence of position. Two positions are by definition &quot;the same&quot; if the same types of pieces occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture &quot;en passant&quot; is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely.

The game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time – one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the arbiter. The claim must be made either before making the move which will produce the third repetition, or after the opponent has made a move producing a third repetition. By contrast, the fivefold repetition rule requires the arbiter to intervene and declare the game drawn if the same position occurs five times, needing no claim by the players.

Similar rules exist in other abstract strategy games such as xiangqi and shogi (cf. &quot;sennichite&quot;) whereas in Go, repetition of the immediately previous board position is completely disallowed in the first place, and in some regional rule sets repetition of any previous board position is disallowed.

Internet chess servers differ in their handling of draw by repetition. For example, Chess.com draws the game automatically upon a position&#x27;s third occurrence.

==Statement of the rule==
The relevant rules in the FIDE laws of chess are summarized as:

:The game is a draw if a position occurs (at least) three times during the game. (Intervening moves do not matter.) It must be claimed by the player with the turn to move. The claim is made:

::(a) If the position is about to appear for the third time, the player making the claim first writes their move on their and notifies the that they intend to make this move.

::or

::(b) If the position has just appeared for the third time, the player with the move can claim the draw.

: Positions are considered the same if
: (1) the same player has the move,
: (2) pieces of the same kind and color occupy the same squares, and
: (3) the possible moves of all the pieces are the same.

: Under (3) above, positions are not considered to be the same if:
::(a) in the first position, a pawn could have been captured &quot;en passant&quot; (by the &quot;en passant&quot; rule, in the subsequent positions, the pawn cannot be captured &quot;en passant&quot; anymore), or
::(b) either player has lost a right to castle, i.e. either king or one of the rooks has been moved, in between repetitions of the position.

Although a threefold repetition usually occurs after consecutive moves, there is no requirement that the moves be consecutive for a claim to be valid. The rule applies to positions, not moves.

Perpetual check is no longer specifically mentioned in the rules of chess; such a situation will eventually resolve to a draw either by repetition, fifty-move rule or (most commonly) by agreement.

If the claim for a draw is incorrect, the opponent is awarded an extra two minutes, the written move (if legal) move must be played and the game continues. Unreasonable claims may be penalized under rule 11.5, which forbids distracting or annoying the opponent. Even if the claim is incorrect, any draw claim is also a draw offer that the opponent may accept.

===Fivefold repetition===
In 2014 FIDE introduced a rule providing for a mandatory draw in the event of a fivefold repetition. If the same position occurs five times, then the game is immediately terminated as a draw. If an arbiter detects a fivefold repetition, they are required to intervene and declare the game a draw. If an arbiter does not detect a fivefold repetition or fails to intervene, a player may still make a claim for fivefold repetition. If the claim is verified, the game is declared a draw regardless of any subsequent moves or result, which are void.

==Examples==

===1972 World Championship===
The seventeenth and eighteenth game of the 1972 World Championship match in Reykjavik between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky were declared draws because of threefold repetition. The twentieth game was drawn after an incorrect claim (see incorrect claims below).

===Fischer vs. Petrosian, 1971===

In the third game of the 1971 Candidates Final Match in Buenos Aires between Bobby Fischer and Tigran Petrosian, Petrosian (with a better position) accidentally allowed the position after 30.Qe2 () to be repeated three times. Play continued:
:30... Qe5
:31. Qh5 Qf6 
31...Qxf4 32.Qxf7+ also leads to threefold repetition.
:32. Qe2 (second time) Re5
:33. Qd3 Rd5?
and then Fischer wrote his next move
:34. Qe2 (third time) ½-½
on his , which is the third appearance of the position with Black to move, and he claimed a draw. At first Petrosian was not aware of what was going on. Incidentally, this was the first time a draw by threefold repetition had been claimed in his career. This also illustrates that the intermediate moves do not need to be the same – just the positions.

===Capablanca vs. Lasker, 1921===

As noted above, one of the players must claim a draw by threefold repetition for the rule to be applied, otherwise the game continues. In the fifth game of the 1921 World Chess Championship match in Havana between José Raúl Capablanca and Emanuel Lasker, the same position occurred three times, but no draw was claimed. After 34...h5 (), the moves were:

:35. Qd8+ Kg7
:36. Qg5+ Kf8 (second time)
:37. Qd8+ Kg7
:38. Qg5+ Kf8 (third time)

Capablanca had repeated the moves to gain time on the clock (i.e. get in some quick moves before time control). The game continued without a draw being claimed; Lasker blundered and resigned on move 46. (Capablanca went on to win the match and become world champion.)
===Two games between Alekhine and Lasker, 1914===


The game between Alexander Alekhine and world champion Emanuel Lasker in Moscow 1914 ended in a short draw. After 16.Qg6 () the players agreed to a draw because Alekhine can force the threefold repetition, for example 16...Qe8 17.Qxh6+ Kg8 18.Qg5+ Kh8 19.Qh6+. 

In the first game between the two players in the St. Petersburg tournament 1914, Alekhine, this time with the black pieces, after 21.Qd4 (), forced a draw by threefold repetition using a similar process.
===Portisch vs. Korchnoi, 1970===

A famous draw for threefold repetition occurred in the fourth game between Lajos Portisch and Viktor Korchnoi in Belgrade in the Russia (USSR) vs. Rest of the World 1970 match. After 21...Qb5 (), in a clearly better position, Portisch allowed this position to repeat three times and was criticized by teammate Bobby Fischer for allowing it. If Portisch had won the game, the match would have been a tie. Play continued:

:22. Bf1 Qc6
:23. Bg2 Qb5 (second time)
:24. Bf1 Qc6
:25. Bg2 ½-½
allowing Black to claim the threefold repetition with 25...Qb5.
===Kasparov vs. Deep Blue, 1997===
In the game between Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue in New York 1997, the game ended with a draw by agreement, because after 49...Kb4 (), if White plays 50.g8=Q, Black can force perpetual check and claim a draw after 54.Kb1 by threefold repetition:

:50...Rd1+
:51.Ka2, Kb2 or Kc2 Rd2+
:52.Kb1 (second time) Rd1+
:53.Ka2, Kb2 or Kc2 Rd2+
:54.Kb1 (third time)
===Khamparia vs. Bo, 2018===

To detect fivefold repetitions can be challenging for the arbiter. In the game Akshat Khamparia vs. Li Bo, Budapest 2018, Li twice requested a draw, saying simply &quot;repetition&quot;. Both times the request was rejected because it was not made correctly according to the threefold repetition rule. Li was later checkmated. Li disputed the result, indicating that the position had occurred five times. The arbiter was able to verify fivefold repetition at moves 60, 62, 68, 73 and 75. Had the fivefold repetition rule not been in effect, the result would have stood, as no correct claim for threefold repetition had been made. Under the fivefold repetition rule, however, the fifth occurrence of a position immediately terminates the game, and subsequent moves become irrelevant. The result was therefore overturned, and the game was declared a draw.
===Opening line===

An Austrian Attack line from the Pirc Defence has been analyzed out to a draw by threefold repetition. After the moves 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 c5 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 fxe6 9.Ng5 Bxb5! 10.Nxe6 Bxd4! 11.Nxd8 () Black can force perpetual check and so the draw by the following moves:

:11...Bf2+
:12.Kd2 (first time) Be3+
:13.Ke1 Bf2+
:14.Kd2 (second time) Be3+
:15.Ke1 Bf2+
:16.Kd2 (third time)

15...Bf2+ is only a twofold repetition, as White lost their castling right only after 12.Kd2. Threefold repetition will be in effect on the next occurrence of the position.
===Grandmaster draws===

A grandmaster draw is characterised as a short draw between high-level players, typically intended to hold position without the expenditure of mental energy. As short draws by agreement are sometimes frowned upon or outright banned in tournaments, some players circumvent such rules by playing out lines known to end in threefold repetition draws. The Berlin draw in the Ruy Lopez is one of the more commonly used lines, while Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura finished out a dead rubber at the Magnus Carlsen Invitational with a variation of the Bongcloud Attack – Nakamura admitted that with both players secure in passage to the next round of the tournament he saw no value in attempting to force the win.
==Repeating a position to gain time==
Players sometimes repeat a position once not in order to draw, but to gain time on the clock (when an increment is being used) or to bring themselves closer to the time control (at which point they will receive more time). Occasionally, players miscount and inadvertently repeat the position more than once, thus allowing their opponent to claim a draw in an unfavourable position. The game between Ponomariov and Adams in Wijk aan Zee 2005 may have been an example of this.

==Incorrect claims==
Even top players have made incorrect claims of a draw under this rule. The Karpov–Miles game is an example of the right to castle having to be the same in all positions. The Fischer–Spassky game is an example that it must be the same player&#x27;s move in all three positions.

===Karpov vs. Miles, 1986===

The clause about the right to castle is a subtle but important one. In a game between grandmasters Anatoly Karpov and Tony Miles in Tilburg 1986, Karpov had less than five minutes remaining on his clock in which to finish a specified number of moves or forfeit the game. He claimed a draw by repetition after checking his scoresheet carefully, whereupon it was pointed out to him that in the first occurrence of position, Black&#x27;s king had had the right to castle, whereas in the second and third it had not. Tournament rules stipulated that a player be penalized with three minutes of their time for incorrect claims, which left Karpov&#x27;s flag on the verge of falling. By then, Miles had taken the draw. (Miles should have readily accepted a draw in that position, but Karpov was close to losing the game because of time control.) After 22.Nb5 (), play continued:

: 22... Ra4 (Black loses queenside castling right)
: 23. Nc3 Ra8
: 24. Nb5 (first time only, Black lost queenside castling right) Ra4
: 25. Nc3 Ra8
: 26. Nb5 (second time only, Black lost queenside castling right) ½-½

Black was able to castle the first time the arrangement of pieces in the diagram occurred, but not when the arrangement was repeated.
===Fischer vs. Spassky, 1972===

In the twentieth game of the 1972 World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky, Fischer called the Lothar Schmid to claim a draw because of threefold repetition. Spassky did not dispute it and signed the scoresheets before the arbiter ruled. After the draw had been agreed, it was pointed out that the position had occurred after White&#x27;s 48th () and 50th moves, and again after Black&#x27;s 54th move. So the claim was actually invalid because it was not the same player&#x27;s turn to move in all three instances, but the draw result stood.
==History of the rule==

The rule has been variously formulated at different times in chess history. In Tim Harding&#x27;s MegaCorr database (a collection of correspondence chess games), the notes to a game between the cities of Pest and Paris played between 1842 and 1845 state that a sixfold repetition was necessary to claim a draw. The game went: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.0-0 0-0 8.c4 Be6 9.Qc2 f5 10.Qb3 dxc4 11.Qxb7 c6 12.Bxe4 fxe4 13.Ng5 Bf5 14.Nc3 Qd7 15.Qxd7 Nxd7 16.Ngxe4 Bc7 17.Re1 Rab8 18.Re2 Nb6 19.Nc5 () 

:19... Bd6
:20. N5e4 Bc7
:21. Nc5 (second time) Bd6
:22. N5e4 Bc7
:23. Nc5 (third time) Bd6
:24. N5e4 Bc7
:25. Nc5 (fourth time) Bd6
:26. N5e4 Bc7
:27. Nc5 (fifth time)
and now instead of taking the sixfold repetition draw with 27...Bd6 28.N5e4 Bc7, Paris diverged with 27...Bd3 and went on to lose the game.

The first use of such a rule was in a tournament in London in 1883, but was stated vaguely: &quot;... if a series of moves be repeated three times the opponent can claim a draw.&quot; The rules for the first official World Chess Championship 1886 match between Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort stated: &quot;... if both players repeat the same series of moves six times in succession, then either player may claim a draw.&quot; In two of the games the same position was repeated three times. The rule was modified soon afterward to be based on positions instead of moves, and for three repetitions. Draws by this method used to be uncommon.

The first edition of the FIDE rule from 1928 already defines the threefold repetition rule without considering castling and &quot;en passant&quot; capture rights. To additionally consider castling and &quot;en passant&quot; capture rights was implicitly introduced in 1975 and explicitly worded in 1985. Prior to that, a 1964 FIDE interpretation established the same.

===Pillsbury vs. Burn, 1898===

In this 1898 Vienna tournament game between Harry Pillsbury and Amos Burn, the same position occurred three times, but no draw could be claimed under the rules at the time. The tournament was played under the rules of Bilguer&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; (1843, with later editions), in which the three-fold rule was stated as the repetition of moves or a sequence of moves, not a position. After 42...Qe3 (), the game continued:

:43. Qb2 Kh6
:44. Qc2 Kh7
:45. Qb2 Kg8
:46. Qc2 Kg7 (second time)
:47. Qb2 Kh7
:48. Qc2 Kh6
:49. Qb2 Kh7
:50. Qc2 Kg7 (third time)
:51. Qb2
Under modern rules, Black could claim a draw by informing the arbiter of their intention to play 50...Kg7, producing the same position as had occurred after 42...Qe3 and 46...Kg7. Alternatively, after 51.Qb2, Black could claim a draw immediately because White has repeated the position after 43.Qb2 and 47.Qb2. Burn went on to win the game.
==Other games==
In many abstract strategy games there are rules to cover repetition of position. In some games this results in a draw, in others it is forbidden to repeat a position.

Currently, shogi employs a fourfold repetition (千日手 &quot;sennichite&quot;) rule, which is required to end in a draw. Each player must have the same pieces in hand as well as the same position on the board. The result is a draw. However, a fourfold repetition with perpetual checks is illegal, and results not in a draw but in a loss by the checking player. 

In Xiangqi, rules about repetitions vary between different sets of rules, but generally &quot;perpetual attacks&quot; (長打), including perpetual check, perpetual threatmate, and perpetual chase, are forbidden. 

Arimaa does not allow threefold repetition of the same position with the same player to move.

In Go, a player may not make a move which repeats the previous position, as would occur if a player were to immediately recapture a stone in a ko situation. Creating ko threats is an important strategic consideration in Go.

<text>Felix Unger (born 2 March 1946 in Klagenfurt, Austria) is a heart specialist who served as the president of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts for three decades. He is the president of Alma Mater Europaea. In 1986, he performed Europe&#x27;s first staged artificial heart transplantation - a temporary solution used until a natural donor heart becomes available. Europe&#x27;s first total artificial heart transplant was led by Bjarne Semb in 1985.
==Life==
Unger studied medicine at University of Vienna, graduating in 1971. After graduation, he practiced at University Clinic for Cardiology in Vienna (1971, 1972) and at the local University Surgical Clinic (1972–1977) and in 1975 as a researcher in the field of Cardiovascular medicine in Houston, Cleveland and Salt Lake City in USA. In the year of 1978, he received his Ph.D, became Associate Professor (and later Full Surgical Professor). In Salt Lake City, he invented Ellipsoidheart, later used by Unger for his 1986 artificial heart transplant procedure. In 1990 he founded the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, together with Kardinal König and Professor Lobkowicz. From 1985 to 2011 he was the leader of the University Clinic for cardiac surgery in Salzburg. From 2001, he has been the president of the European Institute of Health. Prof. Unger is a member of a number of academies of science: a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Latvia, Slovenia and Serbia; a regular member of the German Leopoldina, Slovakia and the New York Academy of Sciences; and the world and the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts.

<text>Ossining station is a commuter rail station on the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line, located in Ossining, New York. Near the station is a ferry dock which is used by the NY Waterway-operated Haverstraw–Ossining Ferry. The station has two high-level island platforms, each 10 cars long, serving the line&#x27;s four tracks.

==History==

The Hudson River Railroad reached Ossining on September 29, 1849, opening the village up to industrial development along the waterfront and allowing farmers inland to ship their produce to the markets of New York City. Among the riverside industrial concerns benefiting from the railroad were the marble quarries at Sing Sing Prison, Benjamin Brandreth&#x27;s pill factory (still extant a short distance up the river) and others. These businesses gradually supplanted the boat builders and docks that had occupied the riverfront in the early 19th century.

Originally the station building was at grade level. In 1914 the New York Central Railroad, which the Hudson River had long been merged into, built a new station, the current building, in the Renaissance Revival style. It was placed on metal stilts to allow Main Street to pass over the tracks, eliminating the grade crossing that had been part of the original station. Like the rest of the Hudson Line, the station became a Penn Central station once the NYC &amp; Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA&#x27;s Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2000, New York Waterways used the station as the eastern port for the Haverstraw–Ossining Pedestrian Ferry creating a link between the station and Central Rockland County.

<text>Thomas Boston (17 March 167620 May 1732) was a Scottish Presbyterian church leader, theologian and philosopher. Boston was successively schoolmaster at Glencairn, and minister of Simprin in Berwickshire, and Ettrick in Selkirkshire. In addition to his best-known work, &quot;Human Nature in Its Fourfold State&quot;, one of the religious classics of Scotland, he wrote an original little book, &quot;The Crook in the Lot&quot;, and a learned treatise on the Hebrew points. He also took a leading part in the Courts of the Church in what was known as the &quot;Marrow Controversy,&quot; regarding the merits of an English work, &quot;The Marrow of Modern Divinity&quot;, which he defended against the attacks of the &quot;Moderate&quot; party in the Church. Boston, if unduly introspective, was a man of singular piety and amiability. His autobiography is an interesting record of Scottish life, full of sincerity and tenderness, and not devoid of humorous touches, intentional and otherwise.

==Life==
He was born at Duns. His father, John Boston, and his mother, Alison Trotter, were both Covenanters. He was educated at Edinburgh, and licensed in 1697 by the presbytery of Chirnside. In 1699 he became minister of the small parish of Simprin, where there were only 90 examinable persons; previously, he was a schoolmaster in Glencairn. In 1704 he found, while visiting a member of his flock, a book brought into Scotland by a commonwealth soldier, the &quot;Marrow of Modern Divinity&quot;, by Edward Fisher, a compendium of the opinions of leading Reformation divines on the doctrine of grace and the offer of the Gospel, which set off the Marrow Controversy.

Its object was to demonstrate the unconditional freeness of the Gospel. It cleared away such conditions as repentance, or some degree of outward or inward reformation, and argued that where Christ is heartily received, full repentance and a new life follow. On Boston&#x27;s recommendation, James Hog of Carnock reprinted &quot;The Marrow&quot; in 1718; and Boston also published an edition with notes of his own. The book, attacked from the standpoint of high Calvinism, became the standard of a far-reaching movement in Scottish Presbyterianism.

The &quot;Marrow&quot; men were marked by the zeal of their service and the effect of their preaching. As they remained Calvinists they could not preach a universal atonement; rather they were particular redemptionists.

In 1707 Boston was translated to Ettrick, Scotland. He was the only member of the assembly who entered a protest against the lightness of the sentence passed on John Simson, Professor of Divinity at Glasgow, who was accused of heterodox teaching on the Incarnation.

He was born in Duns on 17 March 1676, son of John Boston (who suffered imprisonment in the cause of nonconformity) and Alison Trotter. He was educated at the Grammar School of Duns and was later employed by Alexander Cockburn, notary. He graduated with an M.A. (Edinburgh, 9 July 1694), his whole expenses at college being £10, 14s. 7fd. sterling. He then became schoolmaster of Glencairn in 1695; res. 8 February 1696; was thereafter tutor to young Andrew Fletcher of Aberlady, and chaplain to his stepfather, Colonel James Bruce of Kennet; licen. by Presb. of Duns and Chirnside 15 June 1697; officiated in vacant parishes in the Presb. of Stirling in 1698; ord. to Simprin 21 September 1699; clerk of Synod in 1701; called by the Presb. jure devoluto 24 January 1706; adm. to Ettrick 1 May 1707, the day of the Union of Scotland and England; died 20 May 1732.

He and eleven others gave in a Representation and Petition to the General Assembly of 1721 against an Act passed in the previous year condemning The Marrow of Modern Divinity. The Assembly of 1722 directed that the ministers who had signed the Representation should be rebuked by the Moderator. That was done, and a protest prepared by Boston was not received, but was subsequently printed by the protesters. Boston&#x27;s own writings, together with his devout life and exemplary pastoral labours, contributed greatly to the popularity of the doctrines contained in the Marrow. His communions were attended by crowds from all parts, and he was one of the most influential figures in the Church life of his time. His theology was essentially Calvinistic. A literalism dominated his interpretation of the Scriptures, and he regarded even the Hebrew accents as divinely inspired.

==Family life==
He married on 17 July 1700, Katherine (died 4 March 1737), fifth daughter of Robert Brown of Barhill, Culross, a medical practitioner, and had children
*Katharine, born 24 May 1701, died in 1702

==Works==
Boston&#x27;s autobiography is a record of Scottish life. His other books include &quot;Human Nature in Its Fourfold State&quot;, one of the religious classics of Scotland; &quot;The Crook in the Lot&quot;, a short book noted for its originality; and his &quot;Body of Divinity&quot; and &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. These works had a major influence over the Scottish peasantry. Among his works is a learned treatise on Hebrew points. His &quot;Memoirs&quot; were published in 1776 (ed. George D. Low, 1908). An edition of his works in 12 volumes appeared in 1849.

::Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an&#x27; Boston.
*In Alice Munro&#x27;s short story &quot;No Advantages&quot; (&quot;The View from Castle Rock&quot;, 2006), Boston is described briefly. Munro writes, &quot;In his autobiography he speaks of his own recurring miseries, his dry spells, his sense of unworthiness and dullness even in the act of preaching the Gospel, or while praying in his study...&quot; (pp. 14–15). 
* Boston is also quoted by Reverend McBain in Munro&#x27;s short story &quot;A Wilderness Station&quot; (1992).

<text>The Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is a residential community for senior citizens, particularly those unable to care for themselves.

==History==

The Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care, formerly the Chinese Community Nursing Home for Greater Toronto, came about when Dr. Joseph Wong reportedly felt that there was a lack of emotional support and difficulty in communicating for Chinese seniors within mainstream medical facilities. In 1987, Dr. Wong, gathered a group of thirty Chinese Canadian friends who shared his vision of building a nursing home through grass-root fundraising effort. 

The Yee Hong Centre was officially opened in October 1994. Located on a site in the heart of Scarborough&#x27;s Chinese community, the first Centre at Scarborough McNicoll has a nursing home with a specialized Alzheimer&#x27;s unit and long-term care facility that was honoured thrice as Grand Prize winner of the Ontario Long Term Care Association (OLTCA) Occupational Health and Safety Week Competition since 1997. The Centre includes a Seniors Community Centre which offers a number of social and daycare activities as well as community outreach, drop-in programs and meals-on-wheels. The Macrobian Club, Yee Hong&#x27;s seniors social club which operates within the seniors community centre, received the Certificate of Recognition from the Board of Health of the City of Scarborough. One of the Centre&#x27;s other accomplishments is the non-profit housing complex - the Aw Chan Kam Chee Evergreen Manor - featuring 130 apartments and 26 family townhouses. The Centre applied to the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation, and was awarded a three-year accreditation in June 1996, its 20th month of operation. It was awarded the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association&#x27;s Award for Excellence in 1997. In 2003, it marked the third consecutive time Yee Hong has been accredited by the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation. With 155 beds at present in Scarborough McNicoll, the K.C. Poon Nursing Home is also connected to a medical centre and a rehabilitation centre. All of the Centre&#x27;s staff are fluently bilingual in both English and Chinese and are familiar with the traditions of the Chinese culture.

In November 1996, just two years after the Scarborough McNicoll&#x27;s grand opening, an ambitious $6 million expansion campaign was launched to add two floors with 65 more beds to the existing nursing home and extra day care program space. It received funding approval for the additional long term care beds from the provincial government in 1998. The expansion was completed and the first resident, who had been on the waiting list since 1994, was admitted on June 14, 1999.

In December 1999 the Council awarded another three-year accreditation to the just expanded facility. It praised Yee Hong for providing &quot;stellar care&quot; to elderly members of the Chinese population in Scarborough, and stated that there were no recommendations suggested to improve the facility.
With the Expansion Campaign accomplished, Yee Hong has provided care to communities in other regions and to other seniors. In 1998 and 2001, the Ministry of Health awarded Yee Hong Centre a total of 715 bed licences, the largest such allocation to a non-profit organization in the history of Ontario.

The Yee Hong Centre Capital Campaign was embarked upon in April 1999 to build three new Yee Hong Centres with 200 beds each in Markham and Mississauga and 250 in the new Scarborough Finch centre. Yee Hong extended its services to non-Chinese seniors, particularly those of the South Asian, Filipino and Japanese communities. All three centres contain an Alzheimer unit. A child care centre will exist side by side with the senior day care centre in the Markham and Mississauga sites with their location in relatively young communities. The Scarborough Finch Centre will accommodate a 5-bed dialysis unit, the first one of its kind to be based in a nursing home. A separate 10-bed hospice care centre unit within the complex is being built.

In 2019, the provincial government approved an additional 800 beds for Yee Hong (256 beds in Markham, 320 beds in Mississauga and 224 beds in Scarborough).

<doc id="557127" wikidata="Q7443806" url="?curid=557127" title="Secondary average">
<text>Secondary average, or SecA, is a baseball statistic that measures the sum of extra bases gained on hits, walks, and stolen bases (less times caught stealing) depicted per at bat. Created by Bill James, it is a sabermetric measurement of hitting performance that seeks to evaluate the number of bases a player gained independent of batting average. Unlike batting average, which is a simple ratio of base hits to at bats, secondary average accounts for power (extra base hits), plate discipline (walks), and speed (stolen bases minus times caught stealing). Secondary averages have a higher variance than batting averages.

==Formula==
The formula to calculate secondary average is:

*&quot;BB&quot; = bases on balls
*&quot;TB&quot; = Total bases
*&quot;H&quot; = Hits
*&quot;SB&quot; = Stolen bases
*&quot;CS&quot; = Caught stealing
*&quot;AB&quot; = At bats

The resulting number rounded to the thousandth place is a player&#x27;s secondary average. Variations to the formula exist, with some statisticians not counting caught stealing while others multiply caught stealing to increase its significance/negative effects.

==Relation to batting average==

Although they share a limited correlation, overall league averages for secondary average are inclined to correspond with league batting averages, which allows for a viable reference point for secondary average in comparison to batting average.

A player can possess a low batting average yet still be a valuable offensive contributor if he has a high secondary average. However, a low secondary average is not necessarily an indicator of a poor hitter. Ichiro Suzuki is an example of a hitter who relies on batting average for most of his offensive production. Furthermore, batting average and secondary average are not mutually exclusive; a player can have a high batting average as well as a high secondary average. The table below shows the leaders in both batting average and secondary average for the 2013 season (bold indicates leader in both categories).

==Benefits for player evaluation==

Secondary average operates under the principle that batting average is an incomplete indicator of a hitter&#x27;s ability since batting average does not account for power, plate discipline, and speed. According to Scott Gray (working with Bill James), &quot;Secondary average is a much better indicator of offensive ability than batting average&quot;.

Since secondary average evaluates a player&#x27;s offensive contribution independent of batting average, it can identify players who have low batting averages yet are still productive offensively. For example, in 1990, Bill James identified Eric Davis as the most productive batter with a career average below .275; in spite of his low batting average, Davis had a career secondary average of .504, which was the highest of any active player at the time. Batting average was not a great indicator of his true offensive value; secondary average was able to demonstrate his value more effectively.

Adam Dunn is an example of a recent player who has a low batting average but an excellent secondary average, resulting from his high walk totals and power numbers. Notably, during each season in a 5-year stretch in which he hit 40+ home runs, he hit more homers than doubles. Although Adam Dunn only has a career .238 batting average,&#x27; he has a career .456 secondary average, ranking him 12th all-time. As &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reporter John Grochowski demonstrated, Adam Dunn&#x27;s offensive value is more apparent when secondary average is accounted for.

<text>Scarborough station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in the Scarborough area of Briarcliff Manor, New York. Trains leave for New York City every hour on weekdays, and about every 25 minutes during rush hour. It is from Grand Central Terminal, and the trip there takes about 50 minutes. Trains of electric multiple units serve the station. The Scarborough station is within walking distance of most houses in the neighborhood.

Construction of the Scarborough station dates back to the 1860s, when the first station building stood along the Hudson River Railroad, which was completed in 1851 and served areas from New York City to Rensselaer. It became part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x27;s Metro-North Railroad in 1983, following the devolution of commuter rail service from Conrail. The station was included in a revitalization plan in 2007 to help serve its commuters. The 1899 station building has housed the Scarborough post office since 1961.

==History==
The first station building was built by the Hudson River Railroad sometime before 1860, and acquired by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1869. The station was named &quot;Scarborough&quot; until 1867. On July 16 of that year and until November 26, the area was officially called Weskora. The Scarborough station was accordingly changed by local government officials to &quot;Weskora&quot;, and changed back in December 1867.

The Scarborough post office dates to December 3, 1864, when the U.S. Postal Service established a &quot;catch and throw&quot; office there in the same small building as the earlier established station. A hook was installed along the tracks to hang mail bags to be grabbed by workers on the passing trains for outgoing mail distribution; in turn workers threw mail bags off the train for incoming mail distribution. The first postmaster of the Scarborough Post Office facility was James Van Velsor who had an annual salary of $200 ($ in ) in 1873.

A large thunderstorm occurred in the area on August 4, 1898; the newly renovated station building, built in 1893, was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. At the time, the building also housed Scarborough&#x27;s post office. Mail was destroyed although registered mail and money was being kept at the postmaster&#x27;s house each night; damage amounted to $5,000 ($ in ) and the post office opened the next day, with mail being held in a pushcart. The building was reconstructed identically to its predecessor.

In 1909, after the community of Scarborough was incorporated into the village of Briarcliff Manor in 1906, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad put up a sign reading &quot;Briarcliff West&quot; at the station. Soon afterward, attributed to the neighborhood&#x27;s pride over their name, that sign was thrown into the Hudson River and replaced with the original Scarborough sign.

In April 1931, Siamese King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambai Barni traveled from Bangkok to Ophir Hall (currently Reid Hall of Manhattanville College). The couple had flown from Japan to Vancouver and took a train to Chicago. From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30 a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria. The train arrived at the Scarborough station, where journalists, spectators, and video and still photographers met them, along with one of their hosts. They were later driven across the county to stay at Ophir Hall for about six weeks in order for a cataract operation to be performed on the king&#x27;s left eye. State troopers and a squad of New York Central policemen were stationed at Scarborough to ensure a smooth transfer. At the time, the king was an absolute monarch; he later became the country&#x27;s first constitutional monarch.

The Briarcliff Manor village government purchased the 1899 station building in 1961 to house its Scarborough post office. The building was used as a filming location in 1966, in the first episode of the television soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; as the Collinsport train station.

As with the rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA&#x27;s Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station&#x27;s overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station&#x27;s south.

In 2010, Metro-North began a program called Arts for Transit. As part of the program, an art installation was created for the station. The work, titled &quot;Untitled with Sky&quot;, comprises six stained glass windows and twelve seats covered in mosaic tiles. Liliana Porter and Ana Tiscornia worked with Willet Hauser Architectural Glass to create the installations. The windows were originally intended for the overpass, where they were installed for a short time. Around 2011, the windows were moved to the southbound platform. Also in 2011, Hurricane Irene caused a mudslide onto the tracks near the Scarborough station; it damaged of third rail.

Local community members have been maintaining the inside and outside of the building through labor and monetary donations under the group name &quot;Save Scarborough&quot;, and brought attention to the post office&#x27;s 150th anniversary, celebrated on December 3, 2014. About twenty members began their work around 2010, concerned that the downsizing United States Postal Service would close the Scarborough post office, which is a branch of the Briarcliff Manor post office. , the group has spent almost $4,000 in various renovations, upkeep, and improvement costs.
===Notable passengers===
Ridership is moderate, relative to the other Hudson Line stations, with an average of 865 inbound passengers on weekdays and 233 on weekends in 2007. Historical ridership included many notable passengers, including William Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller, C. C. Clarke (the First Vice President of the Hudson River Railroad), Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard, Walter William Law, and the Webb family.

==Station layout==
The station&#x27;s parking lot has had a valet service since the station overhaul in 2007. The ongoing construction took up parking spaces, which spurred the village government to institute valet parking. The parking service has remained since the construction finished. A private contractor has an agreement with the village for three employees to manage that part of the lot. An additional section of the station parking lot is privately owned. The valet service has no extra charge.

===Platform and track configuration===
All of the tracks are powered with a third rail, except Track 1. The station has two high-level side platforms, each eight cars long.

<doc id="557134" wikidata="Q7790039" url="?curid=557134" title="Thomas Gillespie (minister)">
<text>Thomas Gillespie (1708 – 19 January 1774) was a Scottish minister of the Church of Scotland. He was founder of the Synod of Relief. Thomas Gillespie, born in 1708, at Clearburn, Duddingston, was the son of a well-to-do brewer and bonnet-laird — the only son of a second marriage. An interview with Thomas Boston, arranged by his mother, turned his thoughts to the ministry. On the completion of his Arts course in Edinburgh, he entered the Divinity Hall. After some months, however, he left for the Divinity Hall of the Secession Church in Perth. A few weeks’ experience of its narrowness being more than enough, he betook himself to Northampton to complete his studies under Philip Doddridge. He was ordained by a &quot;classis&quot; of the English Presbyterians. Presented and called to Carnock, he was inducted by the Presbytery of Dunfermline in 1741. In the early years of his ministry he was a leader in the Cambuslang and Kilsyth Revivals, and became a trusted correspondent of George Whitfield and Jonathan Edwards. Taking his stand, with the majority of 
the Presbytery, against the Inverkeithing Intrusion, he was summarily deposed by the General Assembly of 1752. In 1761, with two other ministers and their flocks, he formed a new body — the Presbytery of Relief, which had attained a quite considerable place in many parts of Scotland, by the time of his death in 1774.

==Early life==
Gillespie was born at Clearburn Farm, in the parish of Duddingston, Edinburgh (then part of Midlothian). His father, Thomas Gillespie (1688-1712), was a farmer who died when Thomas was young, and his mother, Mary Haliburton (1689-1758), ran the family farm and brewery. She encouraged him to hear Thomas Boston the elder preach.

After a period in the family businesses, Gillespie studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1732. In 1738 he went north to attend the seminary run at Perth by William Wilson (1690–1741) of the Secession Church; but was not impressed and moved on after a short while. He then went to Philip Doddridge at Northampton in 1740, with a recommendation signed by 12 Scottish ministers, five of whom were &quot;Marrow Men&quot;. There he was ordained in January 1741. He ministered at Hartbarrow in Lancashire, and September 1741 was admitted minister of the parish of Carnock, Fife ander the patronage of Col Erskine. The presbytery of Dunfermline agreed to sustain as valid the ordination he had received in England, and to allow a qualification of his subscription to the church&#x27;s doctrinal symbol, so far as it had reference to the sphere of the civil magistrate in matters of religion.

==1740s revival==

Gillespie was closely involved in the religious revivalism of the 1740s in Lanarkshire, at Kilsyth and Cambuslang. It was associated with the preaching of George Whitefield in Glasgow in 1741–2, and was taken up as a phenomenon by John Erskine, &quot;The Signs of the Times Consider&#x27;d&quot; (1742). The local ministers involved were William McCulloch at Cambuslang, and James Robe at Kilsyth. The evangelical John Maclaurin was drawn in from outside, as was Gillespie, who edited the conversion testimonies collected by McCulloch.

Maclaurin and Robe wrote to Jonathan Edwards in New England, in 1742. In ensuing correspondence, Gillespie was in touch with Edwards from 1746/7.

==The Inverkeithing case==
Gillespie absented himself from presbytery meetings held to ordain Andrew Richardson, an unacceptable presentee, as minister of Inverkeithing, in southern Fife not far from Carnock. He was then deposed by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland of 1752. for maintaining that the refusal of the local presbytery to act in this case was justified.

The context was the rise of the Moderate Party of the Church of Scotland, from 1751, led by William Robertson with a group of younger ministers including Hugh Blair, Alexander Carlyle and John Home. They came to an influential position in the Assembly in 1752, on a platform of the Assembly&#x27;s right to adjudicate in patronage disputes. John Erskine, on the other hand, became a leader of the &quot;Popular Party&quot; opposing the Moderates. The opposition was also variously known as the High Flyers, Wild Party, or later as Evangelicals.

==After the deposition==
John Witherspoon wrote the anonymous &quot;Ecclesiastical Characteristics&quot; (1753) to satirise the Moderates, and James Baine became a supporter of Gillespie. Gillespie himself continued to preach, first at Carnock, and then in nearby Dunfermline. There Ralph Erskine died in 1752, and his congregation of the Secession Church sought over a period to have Gillespie as replacement. The Town Council came to support Gillespie, against the local Moderate minister James Thomson.

In 1756 John Bonar received a presentation to the church of Jedburgh, from William Kerr, 4th Marquess of Lothian. He was unable to take it up, however, in the face of strong local opposition, from supporters of Thomas Boston the younger. Boston was minister at Oxnam, just outside Jedburgh, and had the support of the Town Council. The Marquess was on good terms with Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and supported George Whitefield; his objection to the evangelical Boston was personal, rather than theological. When John Douglas was nominated instead of Bonar, Boston persisted, but lost out. In 1759 Gillespie visited Boston in the Lowlands, to give support after he resigned his ministry at Oxnam.

==The Relief Church==
In 1761, with Thomas Boston of Jedburgh, and Thomas Colier at Colinsburgh, Gillespie formed a distinct communion under the name of the &quot;Presbytery of Relief&quot;—relief, that is to say, from patronage and the church courts.

The foundation arose from a further dispute, at Kilconquhar in Fifeshire, over a presentation made by the James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres, when the minister James Clidsdale died in 1759, and Balcarres nominated John Chalmers as successor. Witherspoon criticised the imposition of Chalmers over local feelings, when in 1760 the General Assembly backed him. Shortly there was a secession from the congregation of Kilconquhar, meeting at Colinsburgh. Gillespie became involved, first suggesting Thomas Scott of Hexham as minister for the seceders, who was in poor health and declined. In 1761, Gillespie visited Colinsburgh, and paved the way for Colier, a native of Fife, who became minister there. His induction by Boston and Gillespie marked the beginning of the &quot;Presbytery of Relief&quot;.

Early expansions of the Presbytery were after secessions at Blairlogie (where William Cruden was rejected by the General Synod in 1760, and Auchtermuchty where Thomas Scott of Hexham came as minister in 1763. As the 1760s proceeded, congregations joined at Duns, Scottish Borders and Bellshill, where Gillespie preached in 1762. James Baine took an Edinburgh church, Lady Yester&#x27;s, for the Presbytery at the end of 1766, inducted by Gillespie, over the claims of William Cruden; who went to a Glasgow church in 1767 after Boston had died.

From 1769 the Relief Church, as it had become after further rapid growth, experienced internal tensions. Gillespie was believed to favour a reconciliation with the Church of Scotland, and began to distance himself, but on his death in 1774, the Relief Church maintained its independence. It eventually became one of the communions combining to form the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland.

Gillespie&#x27;s only literary works were an &quot;Essay on the Continuation of Immediate Revelations in the Church&quot;, and a &quot;Practical Treatise on Temptation&quot;. Both works appeared posthumously (1774). In the former he argued that immediate revelations are no longer vouchsafed to the church; in the latter he traced temptation to the work of a personal devil.

==Family==

On 19 November 1744 he married Margaret Riddell daughter of Dr John Riddell, physician, of Edinburgh. She died on 19 November 1744 without issue.

<text>Philipse Manor station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in the Philipse Manor area of Sleepy Hollow, New York, United States.

Built around 1910 and opened on January 30, 1911, the Tudorbethan architecture of the station&#x27;s original has earned it a listing on the National Register of Historic Places as an intact example of an early commuter rail station. It is the only station on the Hudson Line besides Poughkeepsie to be so recognized. In 1796 the plot of land was used for Rodrigo Curls, a Portuguese immigrant who used the plot of land for fishing, he owned it until the 1830s. This is referenced in documents found in the official website of the Village of Tarrytown.

==History==
The construction of the Hudson River Railroad and its later acquisition by the New York Central in the late 19th century opened up the river towns in Westchester County for suburbanization. It became possible for those of sufficient means to live in large houses amid the pastoral and scenic riverside, and accordingly villages like Irvington, Tarrytown and North Tarrytown (today&#x27;s Sleepy Hollow) began to grow and develop.

Undeveloped areas along the railroad line were soon snapped up by developers who saw the possibilities. In 1900 one, John Brisben Walker, acquired the old Kingsland estate in the north of North Tarrytown and began subdividing it. One of his selling points was the rail access, but this failed to materialize and Walker had to sell the property, now called Philipse Manor in a confused reference to nearby Philipsburg Manor House,&lt;ref name=&quot;Philipse/Philipsburg Manor&quot; group=note&gt;The actual Philipse Manor is in Yonkers, some ten miles (16 km) to the south (both manor houses served the original Philipsburg Manor).&lt;/ref&gt; and had to sell to William Bell, who was able to complete it. Construction continued and subdivided land was sold under the name Philipse Manor Company. Bell made the rail service possible by building the station and presenting it to the railroad. Train service began on January 30, 1911.

It remained in use throughout the private ownership of the railroad. When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority assumed passenger commuter operations of the then-bankrupt Penn Central in the early 1970s and passed it along to Metro-North in 1983, it eventually closed the station house in favor of automated ticketing operations, and the main house fell into disrepair. The station has since been reused as the Hudson Valley Writers Center, which won an award from the Preservation League of New York State for its work on the station in 2005.

, the MTA has been working to extend the platforms to accommodate eight-car trains and improve service and capacity. It is part of a $56 million program focused on all the Rivertowns stations. The agency expects it will be complete by 2010.

==Station layout==
===Station building===

The main building (no longer used for rail purposes) is a one-story hip-roofed octagonal structure of rock-faced granite block with stone, stucco and wood trim. It is built into the bluff created when the tracks were cut, and thus access to them was provided through the basement, through doors which have since been bricked off.

The station&#x27;s east facade is augmented with two gabled porte-cocheres projecting at oblique angles, each supported by a heavy granite pier. Trapezoidal wings also jut from the narrow sides of the octagon. The loggia across the facade has central round arched opening with a parapet. This does not lead to an entrance, instead backing the fireplace and its corbeled stone chimney. The original roof used slate, but it has been replaced with asphalt shingles.

Inside, the fireplace uses several colors of granite, flanked with original iron radiators. It is complemented by dark oak matchboards over the stucco, laid to simulate paneling and form a dado. Further ornamentation includes a double frieze at ceiling level.

===Platform and track configuration===
The station has two high-level side platforms, each eight cars long.

The more modern station subsequently built by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) consists of two long concrete, elevated side platforms with dark-green painted steel shelters. Between them are the four tracks of this section of the Hudson Line, all with third rails. The inside tracks carry express trains, and diesel-powered Amtrak and Metro-North trains bound for the non-electrified sections between Croton–Harmon and the northern end of the line at Poughkeepsie, none of which stop at Philipse Manor. An overpass connects the two platforms.

<text>STS-84 was a crewed spaceflight mission by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; to the Mir space station.

==Mission highlights==
The STS-84 mission was the sixth Shuttle/&quot;Mir&quot; docking mission and is part of the NASA/Mir program which consisted of nine Shuttle-Mir dockings and seven long duration flights of U.S. astronauts aboard the Russian space station. The prior Shuttle-Mir missions were STS-71, STS-74, STS-76, STS-79 and STS-81. The U.S. astronauts launched and landed on a Shuttle and served as &quot;Mir&quot; crew members while the Russian Mir crewmembers used their Soyuz vehicle for launch and landing. This series of missions expanded U.S. research on &quot;Mir&quot; by providing resupply materials for experiments to be performed aboard the station as well as returning experiment samples and data to Earth.

STS-84 involved the transfer of of water and logistics to and from the &quot;Mir&quot;. During the docked phase, of water, of U.S. science equipment, of Russian logistics along with of miscellaneous material were transferred to &quot;Mir&quot;. Returning to Earth aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; were of U.S. science material, of Russian logistics, of ESA material and of miscellaneous material.

Sixth Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; docking highlighted by transfer of fourth successive U.S. crew member to the Russian Space Station. U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale exchanged places with Jerry Linenger, who arrived at &quot;Mir&quot; 15 January 1997 with the crew of Shuttle Mission STS-81. Linenger spent 123 days on &quot;Mir&quot; and just over 132 days in space from launch to landing, placing him second behind U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid for most time spent on-orbit by an American. Another milestone reached during his stay was one-year anniversary of continuous U.S. presence in space that began with Lucid&#x27;s arrival at &quot;Mir&quot; 22 March 1996.

Other significant events during Linenger&#x27;s stay included first U.S.-Russian space walk. On 29 April 1997 Linenger participated in five-hour extravehicular activity (EVA) with &quot;Mir&quot; 23 Commander Vasily Tsibliyev to attach a monitor to the outside of the station. The Optical Properties Monitor (OPM) was to remain on &quot;Mir&quot; for nine months to allow study of the effect of the space environment on optical properties, such as mirrors used in telescopes.

On 23 February, a fire broke out on the 11-year-old station. It caused minimal damage but required station&#x27;s inhabitants to wear protective masks for about 36 hours until cabin air was cleaned. Besides Linenger, crew members aboard &quot;Mir&quot; at the time included two &quot;Mir&quot; 22 cosmonauts and a German cosmonaut, and two &quot;Mir&quot; 23 cosmonauts.

STS-84 docking with &quot;Mir&quot; occurred on 17 May at 02:33 UTC above the Adriatic Sea. Hatches between two spacecraft opened at 04:25 am, 17 May. Greetings exchanged between STS-84 crew and &quot;Mir&quot; 23 Commander Vasily Tsibliyev, Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin and Linenger, followed by a safety briefing. Linenger and Foale officially traded places at 14:15 UTC.

Transfer of items to and from &quot;Mir&quot; proceeded smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule. One of the first items transferred to station was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Altogether about 249 items were moved between the two spacecraft, and about of water moved to &quot;Mir&quot;, for a total of about of water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware.

The research program conducted by Foale featured 35 investigations total (33 on &quot;Mir&quot;, two on STS-84, and another preflight/postflight) in six disciplines: advanced technology, Earth observations and remote sensing, fundamental biology, human life sciences, space station risk mitigation, and microgravity sciences. Twenty-eight of these were conducted during previous missions and were to be continued, repeated or completed during Foale&#x27;s stay. Seven new experiments were planned in biological and crystal growth studies and materials processing.


Undocking occurred at 01:04 UTC on 22 May. Unlike prior dockings, no flyaround of the station by the orbiter was conducted, but the orbiter was stopped three times while backing away to collect data from a European sensor device designed to assist future rendezvous of a proposed European Space Agency resupply vehicle with the International Space Station.

Other activities conducted during the mission included investigations using the Biorack facility, located in the SPACEHAB Double Module in &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27;s payload bay, a photo survey of &quot;Mir&quot; during docked operations, environmental air samplings and radiation monitoring.

Orbiter performance was normal from launch to landing. For the mission, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was equipped with a SpaceHab Double Module, and a Orbiter Docking System.

<text>North Nibley is a village in Gloucestershire, England about northwest of Wotton-under-Edge.

==Name==
The village is commonly known as &quot;Nibley&quot;, but the official name distinguishes it from the village of Nibley, just outside Yate, about away in South Gloucestershire. Nibley Green is an associated hamlet to its northwest at .

==History==

The Battle of Nibley Green, fought on 20 March 1469/1470, is notable as the last battle fought in England entirely between the private armies of feudal magnates.
The Tyndale Monument was built in honour of William Tyndale, who was born nearby, possibly at Melksham Court, Stinchcombe. Tyndale was responsible for translating the New Testament into English, for which he was sentenced to death and burned at the stake in Vilvoorde, Flanders.

Nibley House, next to the church, was the home of John Smyth (1567–1641), steward of Berkeley Castle and the estates of the Berkeley family, author of &quot;Lives of the Berkeleys&quot; and historian of the early settlement of Virginia.

==Geography==

Nearby Stinchcombe Hill has become popular with walkers and horse riders, and is crossed by the Cotswold Way. The Tyndale Monument stands on Nibley Knoll just above the village, at on the Cotswold Way. From 1992, volunteers have cleared the area to recreate the previously open panoramic views of both the Severn Bridges and beyond to the Black Mountains in Wales.

==Present==
The village shop on Barrs Lane has been run as a voluntary organisation by villagers since 2001. Since 2007 the villagers have organised the annual Nibley Music Festival. The village is home to the Nibley Cobras football team and Nibley cricket team, who have won the Pratt Cup two consecutive seasons. North Nibley Cobras reformed in 2014. Starting in Stroud Division 7, they have gone on to win two league titles and three Cup titles, including a historic treble 2018–19, and are in Division 3 for the 2020–21 season. They set a Stroud League record by not conceding a goal en route to winning the Dennis Mason Trophy 2018–19.

In 2014 the final episode of the third series of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot; featured the futuristic Swinhay House, home of Renishaw plc founder Sir David McMurtry, designed by eco-architect David Austin.

<text>STS-94 was a mission of the United States Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, launched on 1 July 1997.

==Crew==
STS-94 was flown by the same crew that flew STS-83, the only time in the history of human spaceflight that two missions with more than one crewmember had exactly the same crew.

=== Crew seat assignments ===

==Mission highlights==

This was a reflight of the STS-83 Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. MSL was originally launched on 4 April 1997 at 2:20 pm EST and was intended to be on orbit for 15 days, 16 hours. The mission was cut short due to a problem with Fuel Cell #2 and &quot;Columbia&quot; landed on 8 April 1997 after 3 days 23 hours.

The primary payload on STS-83 was the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL). MSL was a collection of microgravity experiments housed inside a European Spacelab Long Module (LM). It built on the cooperative and scientific foundation of the International Microgravity Laboratory missions (IML-1 on STS-42 and IML-2 on STS-65), the United States Microgravity Laboratory missions (USML-1 on STS-50 and USML-2 on STS-73), the Japanese Spacelab mission (Spacelab-J on STS-47), the Spacelab Life and Microgravity Science Mission (LMS on STS-78) and the German Spacelab missions (D-1 on STS-61-A and D-2 on STS-55).

MSL featured 19 materials science investigations in 4 major facilities. These facilities were the Large Isothermal Furnace, the EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack, the Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) and the Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures (CSLM) facility, the Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) and the Combustion Module-1 Facility. Additional technology experiments were to be performed in the Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the High-Packed Digital Television (HI-PAC DTV) system was used to provide multi-channel real-time analog science video.

The Large Isothermal Furnace was developed by the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA) for the STS-47 Spacelab-J mission and was also flown on STS-65 IML-2 mission. It housed the Measurement of Diffusion Coefficient by Shear Cell Method Experiment, the Diffusion of Liquid Metals and Alloys Experiment, the Diffusion in Liquid Led-Tin-Telluride Experiment, the Impurity Diffusion in Ionic Melts Experiment, the Liquid Phase Sintering II Experiment (LIF), and the Diffusion Processes in Molten Semiconductors Experiment (DPIMS).

The Combustion Module-1 (CM-1) facility from the NASA Lewis Research Center housed experiments on Laminar Soot Processes Experiment and the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number Experiment (SOFBALL).

The Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) is designed to investigate the fundamental combustion aspects of single, isolated droplets under different pressures and ambient oxygen concentrations for a range of droplet sizes varying between and . The DCE apparatus is integrated into a single width MSL Spacelab rack in the cargo bay.
The EXPRESS rack replaces a Spacelab Double rack and special hardware will provide the same structural and resource connections the rack will have on the Space Station. It will house the Physics of Hard Spheres (PHaSE) experiment and the Astro/PGBA Experiment.

The Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) is used for the Experiments on Nucleation in Different Flow Regimes, Thermophysical Properties of Advanced Materials in the Undercooled Liquid State Experiment, Measurements of the Surface Tension of Liquid and Undercooled Metallic Alloys by Oscillating Drop Technique Experiment, Alloy Undercooling Experiments, the Study of the Morphological Stability of Growing Dendrites by Comparative Dendrite Velocity Measurements on Pure Ni and Dilute Ni–C Alloy in the Earth and Space Laboratory Experiment, the Undercooled Melts of Alloys with Polytetrahedral Short-Range Order Experiment, the Thermal Expansion of Glass Forming Metallic Alloys in the Undercooled State Experiment, the AC Calorimetry and Thermophysical Properties of Bulk Glass-Forming Metallic Liquids experiment and the Measurement of Surface Tension and Viscosity of Undercooled Liquid Metals experiment.

There were also experiments on measuring microgravity. They included the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), the Microgravity Measurement Assembly (MMA), the Quasi-Steady Acceleration Measurement System and the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE).

The Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) facility supported the Bubble and Drop Nonlinear Dynamics (BDND) Experiment, the Study of the Fundamental Operation of a Capillary-driven Heat Transfer (CHT) Device in Microgravity Experiment, the Internal Flows in a Free Drop (IFFD) experiment and the Fiber Supported Droplet Combustion experiment (FSDC-2).

<text>Tarrytown station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Tarrytown, New York. The Tappan Zee Bridge is not far from the station, resulting in its use by Rockland County commuters.

The station has two slightly offset high-level platforms, each able to accommodate 10 cars. An island platform is located between the western tracks of the four-track line, while a side platform serves the easternmost track.

==History==
The Tarrytown station was first used by commuters in 1890.
The original station building, which also served as the terminus of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s private telegraph wire to his home in Pocantico Hills, was destroyed in a fire caused by a cigarette in April 1922. Plans for a new station were completed three years later in October 1925.

Almost 120 years after the station first went into use, an announcement was made in November 2007 concerning a large scale refurbishment of the station as part of the second phase of MTA&#x27;s Capital Program. The renovated building will include a ticket agent and waiting area, new heated overpasses, stairways and elevators as well as new platforms. Metro-North has set aside $3.5 million for the project with the expectation that design work would be completed by the second quarter of 2008. Work at the Tarrytown station began in October 2009 and was completed, under budget and on schedule in 2012. 

In March 2020, a bakery named The Bakehouse of Tarrytown opened inside the former station building.

==Mission highlights==

The seventh &quot;Mir&quot; docking mission carried a SPACEHAB double module for the docking with Mir, cargo transfer and an astronaut exchange. The shuttle&#x27;s previous &quot;Mir&quot; missions were STS-71, STS-74, STS-76, STS-79, STS-81 and STS-84.

Highlights of the 10-day mission include five days of docked operations between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Mir&quot; and the exchange of crew members Foale and Wolf to continue a permanent American presence of the Russia complex. A spacewalk is scheduled to retrieve the four Mir Environmental Effects Payloads which were attached to the Mir&#x27;s docking module by Linda Godwin and Rich Clifford during STS-76 to characterize the environment surrounding the Mir space station. &quot;Atlantis&quot; will carry the SPACEHAB double module to support the transfer of logistics and supplies for Mir and the return of experiment hardware and specimens to Earth.

The seventh &quot;Mir&quot; docking mission continued the presence of a U.S. astronaut on the Russian space station with the transfer of physician David A. Wolf to Mir. Wolf became the sixth U.S. astronaut in succession to live on &quot;Mir&quot; to continue Phase 1B of the NASA/Russian Space Agency cooperative effort. However, the difficulties encountered by Foale and his predecessor aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, Jerry Linenger, had resulted in intense political pressure on NASA. The final decision between the termination of NASA crewing of Mir with Foale&#x27;s departure, or his scheduled replacement by David Wolf was only made by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin the night before the launch of STS-86.

Foale returned to Earth after spending 145 days in space, 134 of them aboard &quot;Mir&quot;. His estimated mileage logged was 58 million miles (93 million kilometers), making his the second longest U.S. space flight, behind Shannon Lucid&#x27;s record of 188 days. His stay was marred by a collision on 25 June between a Progress resupply vehicle and the station&#x27;s Spektr module, damaging a radiator and one of four solar arrays on Spektr. The mishap occurred while Mir 23 Commander Vasili Tsibliev was guiding the Progress capsule to a manual docking and depressurized the station. The crew sealed the hatch to the leaking Spektr module, leaving inside Foale&#x27;s personal effects and several NASA science experiments, and repressurized the remaining modules.

An internal space walk by Tsibliev and Mir 23 Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin was planned to reconnect power cables to the three undamaged solar arrays, but during a routine medical exam 13 July Tsibliev was found to have an irregular heartbeat. Foale then began training for the space walk, but during one of the training exercises a power cable was inadvertently disconnected, leaving the station without power. On 21 July, it was announced that the internal space walk would not be conducted by the Mir 23 crew but their successors on Mir 24. On 30 July, NASA announced that Wendy Lawrence, originally assigned to succeed Foale on Mir, was being replaced by Wolf. The change was deemed necessary to allow Wolf to act as a backup crew member for the space walks planned over the next several months to repair Spektr. Unlike Wolf, Lawrence could not fit in the Orlan suit that is used for Russian space walks and she did not undergo space walk training.

Following their arrival at the station 7 August, Mir 24 Commander Anatoly Solovyev and Flight Engineer Pavel Vinogradov conducted the internal space walk inside the depressurized Spektr module 22 August, reconnecting 11 power cables from the Spektr&#x27;s solar arrays to a new custom-made hatch for the Spektr. During the space walk, Foale remained inside the Soyuz capsule attached to Mir, in constant communication with the cosmonauts as well as ground controllers.

On 5 September, Foale and Solovyev conducted a six-hour external extravehicular activity to survey damage outside Spektr and to try to pinpoint where the breach of the module&#x27;s hull occurred. Two undamaged arrays were manually repositioned to better gather solar energy, and a radiation device left previously by Jerry Linenger was retrieved.

The docking of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Mir&quot; took place at 3:58 pm EDT, 27 September, with the two mission commanders opening the spacecraft hatches at 5:45 pm Wolf officially joined the Mir 24 at noon EDT, 28 September. At the same time, Foale became a member of the STS-86 crew and began moving his personal belongings back into &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Wolf will be replaced by the seventh and last U.S. astronaut to transfer to Mir, Andrew S. W. Thomas, when the orbiter &quot;Endeavour&quot; docks with the Russian space station during the STS-89 mission in January 1998.

First joint U.S.-Russian extravehicular activity during a Shuttle mission, which was also the 39th in the Space Shuttle program, was conducted by Titov and Parazynski. During the five-hour, one-minute space walk on 1 October, the pair affixed a 121-pound () Solar Array Cap to the docking module for future use by Mir crew members to seal off the suspected leak in Spektr&#x27;s hull. Parazynski and Titov also retrieved four Mir Environmental Effects Payloads (MEEPS) from the outside of Mir and tested several components of the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) jet packs. The space walk began at 1:29 pm EDT and ended at 6:30 pm

During the six days of docked operations, the joint Mir 24 and STS-86 crews transferred more than four tons of material from the SPACEHAB Double Module to &quot;Mir&quot;, including approximately of water, experiment hardware for International Space Station Risk Mitigation experiments to monitor the Mir for crew health and safety, a gyrodyne, batteries, three air pressurization units with breathing air, an attitude control computer and many other logistics items. The new motion control computer replaced one that had experienced problems in recent months. The crew also moved experiment samples and hardware and an old Elektron oxygen generator to Atlantis for return to Earth. Undocking took place at 1:28 pm EDT, 3 October. After undocking, &quot;Atlantis&quot; performed a 46-minute flyaround visual inspection of Mir. During this maneuver, Solovyev and Vinogradov opened a pressure regulation valve to allow air into the Spektr module to see if STS-89 crew members could detect seepage or debris particles that could indicate the location of the breach in the damaged module&#x27;s hull.

During the flight, Wetherbee and Bloomfield fired small jet thrusters on &quot;Atlantis&quot; to provide data for the Mir Structural Dynamics Experiment (MISDE), which measures disturbances to space station components and its solar arrays. Other experiments conducted during the mission were the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth investigation; the Cell Culture Module Experiment (CCM-A), the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) and the Radiation Monitoring Experiment-III (RME-III); the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust (SIMPLE) experiment; and the Midcourse Space Experiment. Two NASA educational outreach programs were also conducted, Seeds in Space-II and KidSat.

<text>William Lindsay Alexander FRSE LLD (24 August 180820 December 1884) was a Scottish church leader.
==Life==

He was born in Leith, the son of William Alexander, a wine merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Lindsay. The only address given for his father appears in 1813 at 7 Blair Street off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh rather than Leith.

He was educated at Leith High School then the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where he gained a lasting reputation for classical scholarship. He entered Glasgow Theological Academy under Ralph Wardlaw in September 1827, but in December of the same year he left to become classical tutor at the Blackburn Theological Academy, afterwards the Lancashire Independent College, in north-west England. He stayed at Blackburn until 1831, lecturing on biblical literature, metaphysics, Greek and Latin.

After short visits to Germany and London, he was invited back to Edinburgh in November 1834 to become minister of North College Street church (afterwards Argyle Square), an independent church which had arisen in 1802 out of the evangelical movement associated with the Haldane brothers, Robert and James. When the church sold its property to the government to make way for the National Museum of Scotland, Alexander&#x27;s congregation worshipped in the Queen Street Hall until 1861 when the new church was completed on George IV Bridge, renamed Augustine Church because of Alexander&#x27;s strong, albeit independent Augustinian influence in his sermons. He deliberately put aside the ambition to become a pulpit orator in favour of the practice of biblical exposition, which he invested with charm and impressiveness.

Alexander took an active part in the &quot;voluntary&quot; controversy which ended in the Disruption of 1843, but he also maintained broad and catholic views of the spiritual relations between different sections of the Christian church. In 1845 he visited Switzerland with the special object of inquiring into the religious life of the churches there. In 1845 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) from the university of St Andrews.

In 1854 Alexander became Professor of Theology at Edinburgh (and Principal of the Edinburgh Theological Hall from 1877), a position which he held until 1881, in spite of many alternative offers.

In 1867 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His address is then given as Pinkie Burn in Musselburgh. He served as its vice president from 1873 to 1878 and from 1880 to 1884.

He died at Pinkieburn House just south of Musselburgh and is buried nearby in Inveresk Churchyard. The grave lies in the south-east corner in the plot of Sir alexander Hope.

==Works==
Alexander published, besides sermons and pamphlets:

*&quot;The Connexion and Harmony of the Old and New Testaments&quot; (Congregational Lecture in London, 1840), 1841; 2nd edit. 1853.
* &quot;Anglo-Catholicism&quot;, Edinburgh, 1843.
* &quot;Switzerland and the Swiss Churches&quot;, Glasgow, 1846. An account of his Swiss journey in &quot;Switzerland and the Swiss Churches&quot;, it led to an interchange of correspondence between the Swiss and Scottish churches.
* &quot;The Ancient British Church&quot; [1852]; revised edition by Samuel Gosnell Green, 1889.
* &quot;Christ and Christianity&quot;, Edinburgh, 1854.
* &quot;Lusus Poetici&quot;, 1861, (privately printed; reprinted, with additions, in Ross&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;). 
* &quot;Christian Thought and Work&quot;, Edinburgh, 1862.
* &quot;St. Paul at Athens&quot;, Edinburgh, 1865.
* &quot;Sermons&quot;, Edinburgh, 1875.

Posthumous was &quot;A System of Biblical Theology&quot;, Edinburgh, 1888, 2 vols. (edited by James Ross). He published also: memoirs of John Watson, minister at Musselburgh (1846), Ralph Wardlaw (1856), and William Alexander, his father (1867); expositions of Deuteronomy (&quot;Pulpit Commentary&quot;, 1882) and Zechariah (1885); and translations of Gustav Billroth on Corinthians (1837), Heinrich Andreas Christoph Havernick&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament&quot; (1852), and Isaak August Dorner&#x27;s &quot;History of the Doctrine of the Person of Christ&quot;, vol. i. (1864).

In 1861 Alexander undertook the editorship of the third edition of John Kitto&#x27;s &quot;Biblical Encyclopaedia&quot;, with the understanding that the whole work should be revised and brought up to date. In January 1870 he became one of the committee of Old Testament revisers. He edited other theological works. His &quot;Hymns for Christian Worship&quot; reached a third edition in 1866.

Alexander frequently contributed to the &quot;British Quarterly&quot;, the &quot;British and Foreign Evangelical Review&quot;, &quot;Good Words&quot;, and other periodicals; he edited the &quot;Scottish Congregational Magazine&quot;, 1835-1840 and 1847–51. To the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica (Eighth edition)&quot; he contributed several articles on topics of theology and philosophy (the publisher Adam Black was a member of his congregation). His articles on &quot;Calvin&quot; and &quot;Channing&quot; raised some controversy, and were changed in the ninth edition. He also contributed to the &quot;Imperial Dictionary of Biography&quot;.

<doc id="557152" wikidata="Q918668" url="?curid=557152" title="Guy Burgess">
<text>Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess (16 April 1911 – 30 August 1963) was a British diplomat and Soviet double agent, and a member of the Cambridge Five spy ring that operated from the mid-1930s to the early years of the Cold War era. His defection in 1951 to the Soviet Union, with his fellow spy Donald Maclean, led to a serious breach in Anglo-United States intelligence co-operation, and caused long-lasting disruption and demoralisation in Britain&#x27;s foreign and diplomatic services.

Born into an upper middle class family, Burgess was educated at Eton College, the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and Trinity College, Cambridge. An assiduous networker, he embraced left-wing politics at Cambridge and joined the British Communist Party. Burgess was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935, on the recommendation of the future double agent Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby. After leaving Cambridge, Burgess worked for the BBC as a producer, briefly interrupted by a short period as a full-time MI6 intelligence officer, before joining the Foreign Office in 1944.

At the Foreign Office, Burgess acted as a confidential secretary to Hector McNeil, deputy to Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin. This post gave Burgess access to secret information on all aspects of Britain&#x27;s foreign policy during the critical post-1945 period, and it is estimated that he passed thousands of documents to his Soviet controllers. In 1950 he was appointed second secretary to the British Embassy in Washington, a post from which he was sent home after repeated misbehaviour. Although not at this stage under suspicion, Burgess nevertheless accompanied fellow spy Donald Maclean when the latter, on the point of being unmasked, fled to Moscow in May 1951.

Burgess&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown in the West until 1956, when he appeared with Maclean at a brief press conference in Moscow, claiming that his motive had been to improve Soviet-West relations. He never left the Soviet Union; he was often visited by friends and journalists from Britain, most of whom reported a lonely and empty existence. He remained unrepentant to the end of his life, rejecting the notion that his earlier activities represented treason. He was well provided for materially, but as a result of his lifestyle his health deteriorated, and he died in 1963. Experts have found it difficult to assess the extent of damage caused by Burgess&#x27;s espionage activities but consider that the disruption in Anglo-American relations caused by his defection was perhaps of greater value to the Soviets than any intelligence information he provided. Burgess&#x27;s life has frequently been fictionalised, and dramatised in productions for screen and stage, notably in the 1981 Julian Mitchell play &quot;Another Country&quot; and its 1984 film adaptation.

Burgess was responsible for revealing to the Soviets the existence of the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret wing of the Foreign Office which dealt with Cold War and pro-colonial propaganda, for which Burgess worked until swiftly ousted after being accused of coming into work drunk.

==Life==
===Family background===
The Burgess family&#x27;s English roots can be traced to the arrival in Britain in 1592 of Abraham de Bourgeous de Chantilly, a refugee from the Huguenot religious persecutions in France. The family settled in Kent and became prosperous, mainly as bankers. Later generations created a military tradition; Burgess&#x27;s grandfather, Henry Miles Burgess, was an officer in the Royal Artillery whose main service was in the Middle East. His youngest son, Malcolm Kingsford de Moncy Burgess, was born in Aden in 1881, the third forename being a nod to his Huguenot ancestry. Malcolm had a generally unremarkable career in the Royal Navy, eventually reaching the rank of Lieutenant Commander. In 1907 he married Evelyn Gillman, the daughter of a wealthy Portsmouth banker. The couple settled in the naval town of Devonport where, on 16 April 1911, their elder son was born, christened Guy Francis de Moncy. A second son, Nigel, was born two years later.

===Childhood and schooling===
The Gillman wealth ensured a comfortable home for the young family. Guy&#x27;s earliest schooling was probably with a governess until, aged 9, he began as a boarder at Lockers Park, an exclusive preparatory school near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. He did well there; his grades were consistently good and he played for the school&#x27;s association football team. Having completed the Lockers curriculum a year early, he was too young to proceed immediately, as intended, to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. Instead, from January 1924 he spent a year at Eton College, a boys&#x27; public school in Eton, Berkshire.

Following Malcolm&#x27;s retirement from the navy, the family moved to West Meon in Hampshire. Here, on 15 September 1924, Malcolm died suddenly of a heart attack. Despite this traumatic event, Guy&#x27;s education proceeded as planned, and in January 1925 he began at Dartmouth. Here he encountered strict discipline and insistence on order and conformity, enforced by frequent use of corporal punishment even for minor infringements. In this environment, Guy thrived both academically and in sports. He was marked by the college authorities as &quot;excellent officer material&quot;, but an eye test in 1927 exposed a deficiency that precluded a career in the navy&#x27;s executive branch. Burgess had no interest in the available alternatives – the engineering or paymaster branches – and in July 1927 he left Dartmouth and returned to Eton.

Burgess&#x27;s second period at Eton, between 1927 and 1930, was largely rewarding and successful, both academically and socially. Although he failed to be elected to the elite society known as &quot;Pop&quot;, he began to develop a network of contacts that would prove useful in later life. At Eton, sexual relationships between boys were common, and although Burgess would claim to explore his homosexuality at Eton, his contemporaries could recall little evidence of this. Generally, Burgess was remembered as amusingly flamboyant, and something of an oddity with his professed left-wing social and political opinions. In January 1930 he sat for and won a history scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, concluding his school career with further prizes in history and drawing. Throughout his life he retained fond memories of Eton; according to his biographers Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert, he &quot;never showed any embarrassment that he had been educated in a citadel of educational privilege&quot;.

===Cambridge===
====Undergraduate====
Burgess arrived in Cambridge in October 1930 and quickly involved himself in many aspects of student life. He was not universally liked; one contemporary described him as &quot;a conceited unreliable shit&quot;, although others found him amusing and good company. After a term, he was elected to the Trinity Historical Society, whose membership was formed from the brightest of Trinity College undergraduates and postgraduates. Here he encountered Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby and Jim Lees, the latter a former miner studying under a trade union scholarship, whose working-class perspective Burgess found stimulating. In June 1931 Burgess designed the stage sets for a student production of Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;, with Michael Redgrave in the leading role. Redgrave considered Burgess &quot;one of the bright stars of the university scene, with a reputation for being able to turn to anything&quot;.
Burgess by this time made no attempt to conceal his homosexuality. In 1931 he met Anthony Blunt, four years his senior and a Trinity postgraduate. The two shared artistic interests and became friends, possibly lovers. Blunt was a member of the intellectual society known as the &quot;Apostles&quot;, to which in 1932 he secured Burgess&#x27;s election. This gave Burgess a greatly extended range of networking opportunities; membership of the Apostles was ostensibly lifelong, so at the regular meetings he met many of the leading intellectuals of the day, such as G. M. Trevelyan, the university&#x27;s Regius Professor of History; the writer E. M. Forster; and the economist John Maynard Keynes.

In the early 1930s, the general political climate was volatile and threatening. In Britain, the financial crisis of 1931 pointed to the failure of capitalism, while in Germany the rise of Nazism was a source of increasing disquiet. Such events radicalised opinion in Cambridge and elsewhere; according to Burgess&#x27;s fellow Trinity student James Klugmann, &quot;Life seemed to demonstrate the total bankruptcy of the capitalist system and shouted aloud for some sort of quick, rational, simple alternative&quot;. Burgess&#x27;s interest in Marxism, initiated by friends such as Lees, deepened after he heard the economist Maurice Dobb, a fellow of Pembroke College, address the Trinity Historical Society on the issue of &quot;Communism: a Political and Historical Theory&quot;. Another influence was a fellow student, David Guest, a leading light in the Cambridge University Socialist Society (CUSS), within which he formed the university&#x27;s first active communist cell. Under Guest&#x27;s influence, Burgess began studying the works of Marx and Lenin.

In 1932 Burgess obtained first-class honours in Part I of the history Tripos and was expected to graduate with similar honours in Part II the following year. But political activity distracted him and by the time of his final examinations in 1933 he was quite unprepared. During his examinations he fell ill and was unable to complete his papers; this may have been the consequence of belated cramming, or of taking amphetamines. The examiners awarded him an &quot;aegrotat&quot;, an unclassified degree awarded to students considered worthy of graduation but prevented through illness from completing their examinations.

====Postgraduate====

Despite his disappointing degree result, Burgess returned to Cambridge in October 1933 as a postgraduate student and teaching assistant. His chosen research area was &quot;Bourgeois Revolution in Seventeenth-Century England&quot;, but much of his time was devoted to political activism. That winter he formally joined the British Communist Party and became a member of its cell within CUSS. On 11 November 1933 he joined a mass demonstration against the perceived militarism of the city&#x27;s Armistice Day celebrations. The protestors&#x27; objective, laying a wreath bearing a pacifist message at the Cambridge War Memorial, was achieved, despite attacks and counter-demonstrations which included what the historian Martin Garrett describes as &quot;a hail of pro-war eggs and tomatoes&quot;. Alongside Burgess was Donald Maclean, a languages student from Trinity Hall and an active CUSS member. In February 1934 Burgess, Maclean and fellow members of CUSS welcomed the Tyneside and Tees-side contingents of that month&#x27;s National Hunger March, as they passed through Cambridge on their way to London.

When not occupied in Cambridge, Burgess made frequent visits to Oxford to confer with kindred spirits there; according to an Oxford student&#x27;s later reminiscences, at that time &quot;it was impossible to be in the intellectual swim ... without coming across Guy Burgess&quot;. Among those he befriended was Goronwy Rees, a young Fellow of All Souls College. Rees had planned to visit the Soviet Union with a fellow don in the 1934 summer vacation, but was unable to go; Burgess took his place. During the carefully escorted trip, in June–July 1934, Burgess met some notable figures, including possibly Nikolai Bukharin, editor of &quot;Izvestia&quot; and former secretary of the Comintern. On his return, Burgess had little to report, beyond commenting on the &quot;appalling&quot; housing conditions while praising the country&#x27;s lack of unemployment.

====Recruitment as Soviet agent====
When Burgess returned to Cambridge in October 1934, his prospects of a college fellowship and an academic career were fast receding. He had abandoned his research after discovering that the same ground was covered in a new book by Basil Willey. He began an alternative study of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but his time was largely preoccupied with politics.
Early in 1934 Arnold Deutsch, a longstanding Soviet agent, arrived in London under the cover of a research appointment at University College, London. Known as &quot;Otto&quot;, his brief was to recruit the brightest students from Britain&#x27;s top universities, who might in future occupy leading positions in British institutions. In June 1934 he recruited Philby, who had come to the Soviets&#x27; notice earlier that year in Vienna where he had been involved in demonstrations against the Austrofascist regime of Engelbert Dollfuss. Philby recommended several of his Cambridge associates to Deutsch, including Maclean, by this time working in the Foreign Office. He also recommended Burgess, although with some reservations on account of the latter&#x27;s erratic personality. Deutsch considered Burgess worth the risk, &quot;an extremely well-educated fellow, with valuable social connections, and the inclinations of an adventurer&quot;. Burgess was given the German codename &quot;Mädchen&quot;, meaning &quot;Girl&quot;, later changed to &quot;Hicks&quot;. He then persuaded Blunt that he could best fight fascism by working for the Soviets. A few years later another Apostle, John Cairncross, was recruited by Burgess and Blunt, to complete the spy ring often characterised as the &quot;Cambridge Five&quot;.

Finally recognising that he had no future career at Cambridge, Burgess left in April 1935 without completing his degree. The long-term aim
of the Soviet intelligence services was for Burgess to penetrate British intelligence, and with this in mind he needed to publicly distance himself from his communist past. Thus he resigned his Communist Party membership and publicly renounced communism, with a gusto that shocked and dismayed his former comrades. He then looked for suitable work, applying without success for positions with the Conservative Research Department and Conservative Central Office. He also sought a teaching job at Eton, but was rejected when a request for information from his former Cambridge tutor received the reply: &quot;I would very much prefer not to answer your letter&quot;.

Late in 1935, Burgess accepted a temporary post as personal assistant to John Macnamara, the recently elected Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelmsford. Macnamara was on the right of his party; he and Burgess joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, which promoted friendship with Nazi Germany. This enabled Burgess to disguise his political past very effectively while gathering important information about Germany&#x27;s foreign policy intentions. Within the Fellowship, Burgess would proclaim fascism as &quot;the wave of the future&quot;, although in other forums such as the Apostles, he was more circumspect. The association with Macnamara involved several trips to Germany; some, by Burgess&#x27;s own later version of events, involving sexual trystsboth men were gay and sexually active. These stories, according to the historian Michael Holzman, may have been invented or exaggerated to draw attention away from Burgess&#x27;s true motives.

In the autumn of 1936, Burgess met the nineteen-year-old Jack Hewit in The Bunch of Grapes, a well-known gay bar in The Strand. Hewit, a would-be dancer seeking work in London&#x27;s musical theatres, would be Burgess&#x27;s friend, manservant and intermittent lover for the next fourteen years, generally sharing Burgess&#x27;s various London homes: Chester Square from 1936 to 1941, Bentinck Street from 1941 to 1947 and New Bond Street from 1947 until 1951.

===BBC and MI6===
====BBC: first stint====
In July 1936, having twice previously applied unsuccessfully for posts at the BBC, Burgess was appointed as an assistant producer in the corporation&#x27;s Talks Department. Responsible for selecting and interviewing potential speakers for current affairs and cultural programmes, he drew on his extensive range of personal contacts and rarely met refusal. His relationships at the BBC were volatile; he quarrelled with management about his pay, while colleagues were irritated by his opportunism, his capacity for intrigue, and his slovenliness. One colleague, Gorley Putt, remembered him as &quot;a snob and a slob ... It amazed me, much later in life, to learn that he had been irresistibly attractive to most people he met&quot;.
Among those Burgess invited to broadcast were Blunt, several times; the well-connected writer-politician Harold Nicolson (a fruitful source of high-level gossip); the poet John Betjeman; and Philby&#x27;s father, the Arabist and explorer St John Philby. Burgess also sought out Winston Churchill, then a powerful backbench opponent of the government&#x27;s appeasement policy. On 1 October 1938, during the Munich crisis, Burgess, who had met Churchill socially, went to the latter&#x27;s home at Chartwell to persuade him to reconsider his decision to withdraw from a projected talks series on Mediterranean countries. According to the account provided in Tom Driberg&#x27;s biography, the conversation ranged over a series of issues, with Burgess urging the statesman to &quot;offer his eloquence&quot; to help resolve the current crisis. The meeting ended with the presentation to Burgess of a signed copy of Churchill&#x27;s book &quot;Arms and the Covenant&quot;, but the broadcast did not take place.

Pursuing their main objective, the penetration of British intelligence, Burgess&#x27;s controllers asked him to cultivate a friendship with the author David Footman, who they knew was an MI6 officer. Footman introduced Burgess to his superior, Valentine Vivian; as a result, over the following eighteen months, Burgess carried out several small assignments for MI6 on an unpaid freelance basis. He was trusted sufficiently to be used as a back channel of communication between Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his French counterpart, Edouard Daladier, during the period leading to the 1938 Munich summit.

At the BBC, Burgess thought his choices of speaker were being undermined by the corporation&#x27;s subservience to the governmenthe attributed Churchill&#x27;s non-appearance to thisand in November 1938, after another of his speakers was withdrawn at the request of the prime minister&#x27;s office, he resigned. MI6 was by now convinced of his future utility, and he accepted a job with its new propaganda division, known as Section D. In common with the other members of the Cambridge Five, his entry to British intelligence was achieved without vetting; his social position and personal recommendation were considered sufficient.

====Section D====

Section D was established by MI6 in March 1938, as a secret organisation charged with investigating how enemies might be attacked other than through military operations. Burgess acted as Section D&#x27;s representative on the Joint Broadcasting Committee (JBC), a body set up by the Foreign Office to liaise with the BBC over the transmission of anti-Hitler broadcasts to Germany. His contacts with senior government officials enabled him to keep Moscow abreast of current government thinking. He informed them that the British government saw no need for a pact with the Soviets since they believed Britain alone could defeat the Germans without assistance. This information reinforced the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s suspicions of Britain, and may have helped to hasten the Nazi-Soviet Pact, signed between Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939.

After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Burgess and Philby, the latter of whom had been brought into Section D on his recommendation, ran a training course for would-be saboteurs at Brickendonbury Manor in Hertfordshire. Philby later was sceptical of the value of such training, since neither he nor Burgess had any idea of the tasks these agents would be expected to perform behind the lines in German-occupied Europe. In 1940, Section D was absorbed into the new Special Operations Executive (SOE). Philby was posted to a SOE training school in Beaulieu and Burgess, who in September had been arrested for drunken driving (the charge was dismissed on payment of costs), found himself at the end of the year out of a job.

====BBC: second stint====
In mid-January 1941 Burgess rejoined the BBC Talks Department, while continuing to carry out freelance intelligence work, both for MI6 and its domestic intelligence counterpart MI5, which he had joined in a supernumerary capacity in 1940. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the BBC required Burgess to select speakers who would depict Britain&#x27;s new Soviet ally in a favourable light. He turned again to Blunt, and to his old Cambridge friend Jim Lees, and in 1942 arranged a broadcast by , a Soviet agent masquerading as a journalist. No transcript of Henri&#x27;s talk survives, but listeners remembered it as pure Soviet propaganda. In October 1941 Burgess took charge of the flagship political programme &quot;The Week in Westminster&quot;, which gave him almost unlimited access to Parliament. Information obtained from regular wining, lunching and gossiping with MPs was invaluable to the Soviets, regardless of the content of the programmes that resulted. Burgess sought to maintain a political balance; his fellow Etonian Quintin Hogg, a future Conservative Lord Chancellor, was a regular broadcaster, as, from the opposite social and political spectrum, was Hector McNeil, a former journalist who became a Labour MP in 1941 and served as a parliamentary private secretary in the Churchill war ministry.

Burgess had lived in a Chester Square flat since 1935. From Easter 1941 he shared a house with Blunt and others at No. 5 Bentinck Street. Here, Burgess maintained an active social life with his many acquaintances, both regular and casual; Goronwy Rees likened the Bentinck Street ambience to that of a French farce: &quot;Bedroom doors opened and shut, strange faces appeared and disappeared down the stairs where they passed some new visitor coming up...&quot; This account was disputed by Blunt, who claimed that such casual comings and goings were contrary to house rules since they would have disrupted other tenants&#x27; sleep.

Burgess&#x27;s casual work for British intelligence deflected official suspicion as to his true loyalties, but he lived in constant fear of exposure, particularly as he had revealed the truth to Rees when trying to recruit the latter in 1937. Rees had since renounced communism and was serving as an officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Believing that Rees might expose him and others, Burgess suggested to his handlers that they should kill Rees, or alternatively that he should do the job himself. Nothing came of this proposal. Burgess constantly sought to further infiltrate higher positions of power, so when he was offered a job in the news department of the Foreign Office in June 1944, he accepted it. The BBC reluctantly assented to his release, stating that his departure would be &quot;a serious loss&quot;.

===Foreign Office===
====London====
As a press officer in the Foreign Office news department, Burgess&#x27;s role involved explaining government policy to foreign editors and diplomatic correspondents. His access to secret material enabled him to send Moscow important details of Allied policy both before and during the March 1945 Yalta Conference. He passed information relating to the postwar futures of Germany and Poland, and also contingency plans for &quot;Operation Unthinkable&quot;, which anticipated a future war with the Soviet Union. His Soviet masters rewarded his efforts with a £250 bonus.

Burgess&#x27;s working methods were characteristically disorganised, and his tongue was loose; according to his colleague Osbert Lancaster, &quot;[w]hen in his cups he made no bones about working for the Russians&quot;. 
 Burgess had maintained contact with McNeil who, following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1945 general election, became Minister of State at the Foreign Office, effectively serving as a deputy to Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin. McNeil, a staunch anti-communist unsuspecting of Burgess&#x27;s true allegiance, admired the latter for his sophistication and intelligence, and in December 1946 secured his services as an additional private secretary. The appointment was in breach of regular Foreign Office procedures, and there were complaints, but McNeil prevailed. Burgess quickly made himself indispensable to McNeil, and in one six-month period transmitted to Moscow the contents of 693 files, a total of over 2,000 photographed pages, for which he received a further cash reward of £200.

Early in 1948, Burgess was seconded to the Foreign Office&#x27;s newly created Information Research Department (IRD), set up to counteract Soviet propaganda. The move was not a success; he was indiscreet, and his new colleagues thought him &quot;dirty, drunken and idle&quot;. Burgess was quickly sent back to McNeil&#x27;s office, and in March 1948 accompanied McNeil and Bevin to Brussels for the signing of the Treaty of Brussels, which eventually led to the establishment of the Western European Union and NATO. He remained with McNeil until October 1948, when he was posted to the Far East. Burgess was assigned to the China desk at a point when the Chinese Civil War was nearing its climax, a communist victory imminent. There were important differences of view between Britain and the US on future diplomatic relations with the forthcoming communist state. Burgess was a forceful advocate for recognition and may have influenced Britain&#x27;s decision to recognise Communist China in 1949.
In February 1949, a fracas at a West End clubpossibly the RACresulted in a fall downstairs that left Burgess with severe head injuries, following which he was hospitalised for several weeks. Recovery was slow; according to Holzman he never functioned well after that. Nicolson noted the decline: &quot;Oh my dear, what a sad, sad thing this constant drinking is! Guy used to have one of the most rapid and active minds I knew&quot;. Later in 1949, a holiday in Gibraltar and North Africa became a catalogue of drunkenness, promiscuous sex and arguments with diplomatic and MI6 staff, exacerbated by the openly homophobic attitudes towards Burgess by some local officials. Back in London, Burgess was reprimanded, but somehow retained the confidence of his superiors, so that his next posting, in July 1950, was to Washington, as second secretary in what Purvis and Hulbert describe as &quot;one of the UK&#x27;s highest profile embassies, the creme de la creme of diplomatic postings&quot;.

====Washington====
Philby had preceded Burgess to Washington, and was serving there as local head of MI6, following in the path of Maclean, who had worked as the embassy&#x27;s first secretary between 1944 and 1948. Burgess soon reverted to his erratic and intemperate habits, causing regular embarrassment in British diplomatic circles. Despite this, he was given work of top secret sensitivity. Among his duties, he served on the inter-allied board responsible for the conduct of the Korean War, which gave him access to America&#x27;s strategic war plans. His frequent behavioural lapses did not prevent his being chosen to act as escort to Anthony Eden, when the future prime minister visited Washington in November 1950. The episode passed without trouble; the two, both Etonians, got on well, and Burgess received a warm letter of thanks from Eden &quot;for all your kindness&quot;.

Increasingly, Burgess was dissatisfied with his job. He considered leaving the diplomatic service altogether, and began sounding out his Eton friend Michael Berry about a journalistic post on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Early in 1951 a series of indiscretions, including three speeding tickets on a single day, made his position at the embassy untenable, and he was ordered by the ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, to return to London. Meanwhile, the United States Army&#x27;s Venona counterintelligence project, investigating the identity of a Soviet spy codenamed &quot;Homer&quot; who had been active in Washington a few years earlier, had unearthed strong evidence that pointed to Maclean. Philby and his Soviet spymasters believed that Maclean might crack when confronted by British intelligence and expose the entire Cambridge ring. Burgess was thus given the task, on reaching London, of organising Maclean&#x27;s defection to the Soviet Union.

===Defection===
====Departure====
Burgess returned to England on 7 May 1951. He and Blunt then contacted Yuri Modin, the Soviet spymaster in charge of the Cambridge ring, who began arrangements with Moscow to receive Maclean. Burgess showed little urgency in proceeding with the matter, finding time to pursue his personal affairs and attend an Apostles dinner in Cambridge. On 11 May he was summoned to the Foreign Office to answer for his misconduct in Washington and, according to Boyle, was dismissed. Other commentators say he was invited to resign or &quot;retire&quot;, and was given time to consider his position.

Burgess&#x27;s diplomatic career was over, although he was not at this stage under any suspicion of treachery. He met with Maclean several times; according to Burgess&#x27;s 1956 account to Driberg, the question of defection to Moscow was not raised until their third meeting, when Maclean said he was going and requested Burgess&#x27;s help. Burgess had previously promised Philby that he would not go with Maclean, since a double defection would put Philby&#x27;s own position in serious jeopardy. Blunt&#x27;s unpublished memoirs state that it was Moscow&#x27;s decision to send Burgess with Maclean who, they thought, would be unable to handle the complicated escape arrangements alone. Burgess told Driberg that he had agreed to accompany Maclean because he was leaving the Foreign Office anyway, &quot;and I probably couldn&#x27;t stick the job at the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;&quot;.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office had fixed Monday 28 May as the date for confronting Maclean with their suspicions. Philby notified Burgess who, on Friday 25 May, bought two tickets for a weekend channel cruise on the steamship &quot;Falaise&quot;. These short cruises docked at the French port of St Malo, where passengers could disembark for a few hours without passport checks. Burgess also hired a saloon car, and that evening drove to Maclean&#x27;s house at Tatsfield, Surrey, where he introduced himself to Maclean&#x27;s wife Melinda as &quot;Roger Styles&quot;. After the three had dined, Burgess and Maclean drove rapidly to Southampton, boarding &quot;Falaise&quot; just before its midnight departurethe hired car was left abandoned on the quayside.

The pair&#x27;s subsequent movements were revealed later. On arrival in St Malo, they took a taxi to Rennes, then travelled by rail to Paris and on to Bern in Switzerland. Here, by prior arrangement, they were issued with papers at the Soviet embassy before travelling to Zürich, where they caught a flight to Prague. Safely behind the Iron Curtain, they were able to proceed smoothly on the final stages of their journey to Moscow.

====Aftermath====
On Saturday 26 May, Hewit informed a friend that Burgess had not come home the previous night. Since Burgess never went away without telling his mother, his absence caused some anxiety in his circle. Maclean&#x27;s non-appearance at his desk on the following Monday raised concerns that he might have absconded. Disquiet increased when officials realised that Burgess, too, was missing; the discovery of the abandoned car, hired in Burgess&#x27;s name, together with Melinda Maclean&#x27;s revelations about &quot;Roger Styles&quot;, confirmed that both had fled. Blunt quickly visited Burgess&#x27;s flat in New Bond Street and removed incriminating materials. An MI6 search of the flat revealed papers that compromised Cairncross, who was later required to resign from his civil service post.

The news of the double flight alarmed the Americans, following the recent conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs and the defection of the physicist Bruno Pontecorvo the previous year. Aware that his own position was now precarious, Philby recovered various spying paraphernalia from Burgess&#x27;s former Washington quarters and buried them in a nearby wood. Summoned to London in June 1951, he was interrogated for several days by MI6. There were strong suspicions that he was responsible for forewarning Maclean via Burgess, but in the absence of conclusive evidence he faced no action and was permitted to retire quietly from MI6.

In the immediate aftermath, the Foreign Office made nothing public. In private circles, many rumours abounded: the pair had been kidnapped by the Russians, or by the Americans, or were replicating the flight of Rudolf Hess to Scotland in 1941 in an unofficial peace mission. The press was suspicious, and the story finally broke in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; on 7 June. A cautious Foreign Office statement then confirmed that Maclean and Burgess were missing and were being treated as absent without leave. In the House of Commons the Foreign Secretary, Herbert Morrison, said there was no indication that the missing diplomats had taken secret documents with them, nor would he attempt to prejudge the issue of their destination.

On 30 June the &quot;Express&quot; offered a reward of £1,000 for information on the diplomats&#x27; current whereabouts, an amount dwarfed shortly afterwards by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s offer of £10,000. There were numerous false sightings in the months that followed. Some press reports speculated that Burgess and Maclean were being held in Moscow&#x27;s Lubyanka prison. Nicolson thought the Soviets would &quot;use [Burgess] for a month or so and then quietly shove him into some salt mine&quot;. Just before Christmas 1953, Burgess&#x27;s mother received a letter from her son, postmarked in South London. The letter, full of affection and messages for his friends, revealed nothing of his location or circumstances.

Evidence against Burgess was not significant at the time of his defection but became apparent with further investigation. Files from the KGB&#x27;s Mitrokhin Archive, released in July 2014, indicated that he had released over 389 top secret documents to the KGB during the first half of 1945 and an additional 168 files in late 1949.

In April 1954, a senior MGB officer, Vladmir Petrov, defected in Australia. He brought with him papers indicating that Burgess and Maclean had been Soviet agents since their Cambridge days, that the MGB had masterminded their escape, and that they were alive and well in the Soviet Union.

===In the Soviet Union===

After being held in Moscow for a short period, Burgess and Maclean were sent to Kuybyshev, an industrial city in the Russian SFSR which Burgess described as &quot;permanently like Glasgow on a Saturday night&quot;. He and Maclean were granted Soviet citizenship in October 1951, and took fresh identities: Burgess became &quot;Jim Andreyevitch&quot;. Unlike Maclean, who learned the Russian language and quickly took up useful work, Burgess spent much of his time reading, drinking and complaining to the authorities about his treatmenthe had not intended his stay to be permanent. He expected to be permitted to return to England, where he thought he could brazen out his MI5 interrogation. He also found the Soviets intolerant of homosexuality, although eventually he was allowed to retain a Russian romantic partner, Tolya Chisekov. By early 1956 Burgess had moved back to Moscow, to a flat on and was working part-time at the Foreign Literature Publishing House, promoting the translation of classic British novels.

In February 1956, the Soviet government allowed Burgess and Maclean to hold a brief press conference, which included two Western journalists, Richard Hughes of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and Sydney Weiland of Reutersthe first concrete proof to the West that the missing diplomats were still alive. In a short statement, they denied they were communist spies and claimed they had come to Moscow &quot;to achieve better understanding between the Soviet Union and the West&quot;. In Britain, reaction to their reappearance was strongly condemnatory, epitomised in a series of articles in &quot;The People&quot;, purportedly written by Burgess&#x27;s former friend Rees. The articles, which described Burgess as &quot;the greatest traitor in our history&quot;, sought to emphasise Burgess&#x27;s dissolute lifestyle and, in the opinion of his biographer Sheila Kerr, &quot;did much to prolong and accentuate repressive attitudes to homosexuality&quot; in Britain. 
In July 1956, the Soviet authorities allowed Burgess&#x27;s mother to visit her son. She stayed a month, mainly in the holiday resort of Sochi. During August the journalist and Labour politician Tom Driberg flew to Moscow to interview Burgess, the two having first met through &quot;The Week in Westminster&quot;. On his return, Driberg wrote a book in which Burgess was portrayed relatively sympathetically. Some assumed that the content had been vetted by the KGB as a propaganda exercise; others thought its purpose was to trap Burgess into revealing information that could lead to his prosecution, should he ever return to Britain.

Over the following years, Burgess received numerous visitors from England. Redgrave came with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in February 1959; this visit led to Burgess&#x27;s meeting with the actress Coral Browne, a friendship later the subject of Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;. In the same year Burgess gave a filmed interview to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In it, Burgess revealed that while he wished to continue living in the Soviet Union, he maintained an affection for his home country. When Prime Minister Harold Macmillan visited Moscow in 1959, Burgess offered his expertise to the visiting party (he had once spent an evening with Macmillan at the Reform Club). His offer was declined, but he used this opportunity to lobby officials for permission to visit Britain where, he said, his mother was sick. Although aware of legal advice that a successful prosecution against Burgess would be problematic, the Foreign Office issued statements implying he would face instant arrest in Britain. In the event, Burgess chose not to put the issue to the test.

===Decline and death===

Burgess suffered from increasing ill health, largely due to a lifestyle based on poor food and excessive alcohol. In 1960 and 1961 he was treated in hospital for arteriosclerosis and ulcers, on the latter occasion being close to death. In April 1962, writing to his friend Esther Whitfield, he indicated how his belongings should be allocated should he die – Blunt, Philby and his romantic partner Chisekov were all named as beneficiaries.

In January 1963 Philby defected to Moscow, having finally been unmasked after official exoneration by Macmillan in November 1955. He and Burgess kept apart, though they may have met briefly when the latter was on his deathbed in August 1963. Burgess died on 30 August 1963, of arteriosclerosis and acute liver failure. He was cremated five days later; Nigel Burgess represented the family, and Maclean delivered a eulogy describing his co-defector as &quot;a gifted and courageous man who devoted his life to the cause of a better world&quot;. Burgess&#x27;s ashes were returned to England, and on 5 October 1963 were interred in the family plot at St. John the Evangelist Churchyard in West Meon.

==Assessment==
Modin considered Burgess the leader of the Cambridge spies: &quot;He held the group together, infused it with his energy and led it into battle&quot;. He sent quantities of information to Moscowthousands of documents including policy papers, Cabinet minutes and notes of Imperial General Staff meetings. According to Holzman, &quot;Burgess and Maclean ensured that hardly anything done by the British Foreign Office was not known to the Soviet foreign intelligence services&quot;. However, views are divided as to what use the Soviets made of this information, or whether they trusted it. Released papers by the Foreign Intelligence Services of the Russian Federation record that &quot;of particular value was the information [he] obtained about the positions of Western countries on the postwar settlement in Europe, Britain&#x27;s military strategy, NATO [and] the activities of British and American intelligence agencies&quot;. But the apparent ease with which Burgess and his colleagues could acquire and send such volumes of data also created suspicions in Moscow that they were being fed misinformation. Thus, the extent of damage to British interests suffered by Burgess&#x27;s activities is a matter of conjecture; Kerr concludes that &quot;despite much-fevered speculation ... there is too little evidence on the effects of [Burgess&#x27;s] espionage and his influence upon international politics for a credible assessment to be feasible.&quot; 
The British establishment found it difficult to accept how someone of Burgess&#x27;s background and education could betray the system that had sustained him in comfort and privilege. According to Rebecca West in &quot;The Meaning of Treason&quot;, the demoralisation and panic caused by Burgess&#x27;s defection was of greater value than the information he passed to the Soviets. The damage to U.S. intelligence co-operation was severe; all atomic intelligence liaison between the two countries was suspended for several years. Foreign Office complacency about recruitment and security was shattered, and although positive vetting was belatedly introduced, the diplomatic service suffered what Burgess&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lownie calls &quot;a culture of suspicion and mistrust that was still being played out half a century after the 1951 flight&quot;.

Against the popular denunciations of &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;spy&quot;, Burgess was, in Holzman&#x27;s words, a revolutionary and idealist, identifying with those who thought that their society &quot;was deeply unjust and that its Empire spread this injustice throughout the world&quot;. He never deviated from the ideological justification that he gave on his reappearance in 1956; he believed that the stark choice to be made in the twentieth century was between America and the Soviet Union. Noel Annan, in his account of British intellectual life between the world wars, states that Burgess &quot;was a true Stalinist who hated liberals more than imperialists&quot; and &quot;simply believed that Britain&#x27;s future lay with Russia not America&quot;. Burgess insisted there was no viable case against him in England (a view secretly shared by British authorities), but would not visit there, since he might be prevented from returning to Moscow where he wished to live &quot;because I am a socialist and this is a socialist country&quot;.

Burgess&#x27;s life, says Lownie, can only be explained by an understanding of &quot;the intellectual maelstrom of the 1930s, particularly amongst the young and impressionable&quot;. Yet Lownie points out that most of his fellow Cambridge communists did not work for the Russians, and indeed reassessed their position after the Nazi–Soviet Pact. Holzman stresses the high price of Burgess&#x27;s political continuing commitment, which &quot;cost him everything else he valued: the possibility of fulfilling intimate relationships, the social life that revolved around the BBC, Fleet Street and Whitehall, even the chance to be with his mother as she lay dying&quot;.

Of the other Cambridge spies, Maclean and Philby lived out their lives in Moscow, dying in 1983 and 1988 respectively. Blunt, who was interrogated many times, finally confessed in 1964, although in return for his co-operation this was not made public before his exposure in 1979; he died four years later. Cairncross, who made a partial confession in 1964 and continued thereafter to co-operate with British authorities, worked as a writer and historian before his death in 1995.

Aspects of Burgess&#x27;s life have been fictionalised in several novels and dramatised on numerous occasions. An early (1954) novel, &quot;The Troubled Midnight&quot; by Rodney Garland, was followed by, among others, Nicholas Monsarrat&#x27;s &quot;Smith and Jones&quot; (1963), and Michael Dobbs&#x27;s &quot;Winston&#x27;s War&quot; (2003), which builds on the pre-war meeting between Burgess and Churchill. Stage and screen works include Bennett&#x27;s &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;, Granada TV&#x27;s 1987 drama &quot;Philby, Burgess and Maclean&quot; (1977), the 2003 BBC miniseries &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, and John Morrison&#x27;s 2011 stage play &quot;A Morning with Guy Burgess&quot;, set in the last months of his life and examining themes of loyalty and betrayal.

Two biographies of Burgess were published in 2016 after the release of secret files to the National Archives. A book review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; included this conclusion: &quot;[leaving] us all the more astonished that such a smelly, scruffy, lying, gabby, promiscuous, drunken slob could penetrate the heart of the establishment without anyone apparently noticing that he was also a Soviet master spy.&quot; The conclusions in both of these biographies support that of Lownie: &quot;that it was Burgess, rather than the notorious Philby, who was the real ringleader of the traitorous circle, and that Guy was a world-class networker.&quot;

<text>STS-87 was a Space Shuttle mission launched from Launch Complex 39B of the Kennedy Space Center on 19 November 1997. It was the 88th flight of the Space Shuttle and the 24th flight of &quot;Columbia&quot;. The mission goals were to conduct experiments using the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4), conduct two EVAs, and deploy the SPARTAN-201 experiment. This mission marked the first time an EVA was performed from &quot;Columbia&quot;. EVAs from &quot;Columbia&quot; were originally planned for STS-5 in 1982 and STS-80 in 1996, but were canceled due to spacesuit and airlock problems, respectively. It also marked the first EVA conducted by a Japanese astronaut, Takao Doi.

==Mission highlights==

STS-87 flew the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4), Spartan-201, Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), TEVA Demonstration Flight Test 5 (EDFT-05), the Shuttle Ozone Limb Sending Experiment (SOLSE), the Loop Heat Pipe (LHP), the Sodium Sulfur Battery Experiment (NaSBE), the Turbulent GAS Jet Diffusion (G-744) experiment, and the Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera/Sprint (AERCam Sprint) experiment. Mid-deck experiments included the Middeck Glovebox Payload (MGBX) and the Collaborative Ukrainian Experiment (CUE).
=== United States Microgravity Payload ===
The United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4) was a Spacelab project managed by Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama. The complement of microgravity research experiments was divided between two Mission-Peculiar Experiment Support Structures (MPESS) in the payload bay. The extended mission capability offered by the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) kit provides an opportunity for additional science gathering time.

=== SPARTAN-201 ===

Spartan 201-04 was a Solar Physics Spacecraft designed to perform remote sensing of the hot outer layers of the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere or solar corona. It was expected to be deployed on orbit 18 and retrieved on orbit 52. The objective of the observations was to investigate the mechanisms causing the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind that originates in the corona. Two primary experiments were the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the White Light Coronograph (WLC) from the High Altitude Observatory. Spartan 201 had three secondary experiments. The Technology Experiment Augmenting Spartan (TEXAS) was a Radio Frequency (RF) communications experiment that provided flight experience for components baselined on future Spartan missions, and a real-time communications and control link with the primary Spartan 201 experiments. This link was used to provide a fine-pointing adjustment to the WLC based on solar images downlinked in real-time. The Video Guidance Sensor (VGS) Flight Experiment was a laser guidance system that tested a key component of the Automated Rendezvous and Capture (AR&amp;C) system. The Spartan Auxiliary Mounting Plate (SPAM) was a small equipment mounting plate that provided a mounting location for small experiments or auxiliary equipment of the Spartan Flight Support Structure (SFSS) It was a honeycomb plate using an experimental silicon carbide aluminum face sheet material with an aluminum core.

=== Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace ===
The Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF) was a sophisticated materials science facility used for studying a common method of processing semiconductor crystals called directional solidification. Solidification is the process of freezing materials. In the type of directional solidification used in AADSF, the liquid sample, enclosed in quartz ampoules, slowly solidified along the long axis. A mechanism moved the sample through varying temperature zones in the furnace. To start processing, the furnace melted all but one end of the sample towards the other. Once crystallized, the sample remained in the furnace to be examined post-flight. The solidification front was of particular interest to scientists because the flows found in the liquid material influence the final composition and structure of the solid and its properties.

=== Confined Helium Experiment ===
The Confined Helium Experiment (CHeX) provided a test of theories of the influence of boundaries on the matter by measuring the heat capacity of helium as it is confined to two dimensions.

=== Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment ===

The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE) was a materials science solidification experiment that researchers used to investigate a particular type of solidification called dendritic growth. Dendritic solidification is one of the most common forms of solidifying metals and alloys. When materials crystallize or solidify under certain conditions, they freeze unstably, resulting in tiny, tree-like crystalline forms called dendrites. Scientists are particularly interested in dendrite size, shape, and how the branches of the dendrites interact with each other. These characteristics largely determine the properties of the material.

Designed for research on the directional solidification of metallic alloys, the (MEPHISTO) experiment was primarily interested in measuring the temperature, velocity, and shape of the solidification front (the point where the solid and liquid contact each other during solidification). MEPHISTO simultaneously processed three identical cylindrical samples of bismuth and tin alloy. In the first sample, the temperature fluctuations of the moving solidification were measured electrically, disturbing the sample. The position of the solid to liquid border was determined by an electrical resistance technique in the second sample. In the third sample, the faceted solidification front was marked at selected intervals with electric current pulses. The samples were returned to Earth for analysis. During the mission, MEPHISTO data were correlated with data from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). By comparing data, scientists determined how accelerations aboard the shuttle disturbed the solid to the liquid interface.

=== Space Acceleration Measurement System ===
The Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), sponsored by NASA Lewis Research Center (now NASA Glenn Research Center), was a microprocessor-driven data acquisition system designed to measure and record the microgravity acceleration environment of the USMP carrier. The SAMS had three triaxial sensor heads that were separate from the electronics package for remote positioning. In operation, the triaxial sensor head produced output signals in response to acceleration inputs. The signals were amplified, filtered, and converted into digital data. The digital acceleration data were transferred to optical disk memory for ground analysis and downlinked to the ground for near-real-time analysis. Each accelerometer had a mass suspended by a quartz element allowing movement along one axis only. A coil was attached to the mass and the assembly was placed between two permanent magnets. An applied acceleration displaced the mass from its resting position. This movement was sensed by a detector, causing SAMS electronics to send a voltage to the coil, producing exactly the magnetic field needed to restore the mass to its original position. The applied voltage was proportional to the applied acceleration and was output to the SAMS electronics as acceleration data.

=== Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment ===
While flying separately in the cargo bay, the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), sponsored by NASA Lewis Research Center (now Glenn Research Center), was an integral part of USMP-04. It was a highly sensitive instrument designed to measure low-level aerodynamic acceleration along the orbiter&#x27;s principal axes in the free-molecular flow regime at orbital altitudes and in the transition regime during re-entry. OARE data were also downlinked during the mission for near-real-time analysis in support of the USMP science experiments. OARE data supported advances in space materials processing by providing measurements of the low-level, low-frequency disturbance environment affecting various microgravity experiments. OARE data also supported advances in orbital drag prediction technology by increasing the understanding of the fundamental flow phenomena in the upper atmosphere.

=== Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment ===
The objective of the Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE) was to determine the altitude distribution of ozone in an attempt to understand its behavior so that quantitative changes in the composition of the atmosphere can be predicted. SOLSE was intended to perform ozone distribution that a nadir instrument can achieve. This was performed using Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to eliminate moving parts in a simpler, low-cost, ozone mapping instrument. The experiment was housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with a canister extension ring and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly (HMDA). Instrumentation included an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics, and baffling. Once in orbit, a crew member activated SOLSE which performed limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region to altitude above the horizon for the Earth&#x27;s surface. Earth viewing observations enabled SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments.

=== Loop Heat Pipe ===
The Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) test advanced thermal energy management technology and validating technology readiness for upcoming commercial spacecraft applications. The LHP was operated with anhydrous ammonia as the working fluid to transport thermal energy with high effective conductivity in zero gravity. LHP was a passive, two-phase flow heat transfer device that was capable of transporting up to 400 watts over a distance of 5 meters through semiflexible, small-diameter tubes. It used capillary forces to circulate the two-phase working fluid. The system was self-priming and totally passive in operation. When heat was applied to the LHP evaporator, part of the working fluid vaporized. The vapor flowed through the vapor transport lines and condensed, releasing heat. The condensation returned to the evaporator via capillary action through the liquid transport lines.

=== Sodium Sulfur Battery Experiment ===
The Sodium Sulfur Battery Experiment (NaSBE) characterized the performance of four 40 ampere-hour sodium-sulfur battery cells, representing the first test of sodium-sulfur battery technology in space. Each cell was composed of a sodium anode, sulfur cathode, and solid ceramic sodium ion-conducting electrolyte and separator. The cells were heated to 350 degrees Celsius to liquefy the sodium and sulfur. Once the anode and cathode were liquefied, the cells started to generate electrical power. Once in orbit, a crewmember activated NaSBE, and then the experiment was controlled by the GSFC Payload Operations Control Center (POCC).

=== Turbulent Gas Jet Diffusion Flames ===
The Turbulent Gas Jet Diffusion Flames (TGDF) payload was a secondary payload that used the standard Get Away Special carrier. Its purpose was to gain an understanding of the fundamental characteristics of transitional and turbulent gas jet diffusion flames under microgravity conditions and to acquire data to aid in predicting the behavior of transitional and turbulent gas jet diffusion flames under normal and microgravity environments. TGDF imposed large-scale controlled disturbances on well-defined laminar microgravity diffusion flames. They were on axisymmetric perturbations to laminar flames. The variables for the proposed tests were the frequency of the disturbance mechanism, which was either 2.5 Hz, 5 Hz, or 7.5 Hz.

=== Get Away Special ===
The Get Away Special (GAS G-036) payload canister contained four separate experiments that hydrated cement samples, recorded configuration stability of fluid samples, and exposed computer discs, compact discs, and asphalt samples to exosphere conditions in the cargo bay of the orbiter. The experiments were the Cement Mixing Experiment (CME), the Configuration Stability of Fluid Experiment (CSFE), the Computer Compact Disc Evaluation Experiment (CDEE), and the Asphalt Evaluation Experiment (AEE).

=== Extended Duration Orbiter ===
The Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) Pallet was a 15-foot (4.6 m) diameter cryo-kit wafer structure. Weighing , it provided support for tanks, associated control panels, and avionics equipment. The tanks stored of liquid hydrogen at −250 degrees Celsius, and of liquid oxygen at −176 degrees Celsius. The total empty mass of the system was . When filled with cryogens, system mass was approximately . Oxygen and hydrogen were supplied to the orbiter&#x27;s three electrical power generating fuel cells, where they were converted into sufficient electrical energy to support the average four family-member house for approximately six months. About of pure drinking water was also produced by the fuel cells. With the EDO pallet, the orbiter could support a flight for a maximum of 18 days. Longer on-orbit missions benefit microgravity research, life sciences research, Earth and celestial observations, human adaptation to the zero-G environment, and support to the Space Station.

=== Middeck Glove Box ===

The mid-deck Glove Box (MGBX) was a facility designed for materials science and biological science experiment handling. It consisted of two primary systems; an Interface Frame (IF) and a Glovebox (GB). The MGBX facility (with associated electronics) provided an enclosed working area for experimental manipulation and observation on the shuttle mid-deck. The MGBX experiments on this flight were WCI – The objective of the Wetting Characteristics of Immiscibles was to investigate the influence of alloy/ampoule wetting characteristics on the segregation of immiscible liquids during microgravity processing. The Enclosed Laminar Flames (ELF) experiment objective was to validate the zero-gravity Burke-Schumann model and the gravity-dependent Hegde-Bahadori extension of the model, investigate the importance of the buoyancy-dependent flow field as affected by oxidizer flow on flame stabilization, examine the state relationships of co-flow diffusion flames under the influence of buoyancy conditions (gravity versus pressure), and study the flow vortex and diffusion flame interactions. The Particle Engulfment and Pushing by Solidifying Interfaces (PEP) experiment objectives were to generate an accurate value for the critical velocity in a convection-free environment, validate the present theoretical model, enhance fundamental understanding of dynamics of insoluble particles at liquid/solid interfaces, and improve understanding of the physics associated with the solidification of liquid metals-ceramic particles mixtures.
=== Collaborative Ukraine Experiment ===
Led by Kadenyuk, the Collaborative Ukraine Experiment (CUE) was a mid-deck payload designed to study the effects of microgravity on plant growth. The CUE was composed of a group of experiments flown in the Plant Growth Facility (PGF) and in the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC). The experiments also required the use of a Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) Freezer and the fixation hardware. Investigators in Ukraine and the United States (Kansas State University and Louisiana State University) selected the experiments as a model for scientific collaboration between the two countries. The PGF supported plant growth for up to 30 days by providing acceptable environmental conditions for normal plant growth. The PGF was composed of the following subsystems: Control and Data Management Subsystems (CDMS), Fluorescent Light Module (FLM), Atmospheric Control Module (ACM), Plant Growth Chambers (PGCs), Support Structure Assembly (SSA), and the Generic External Shell (GES). The complete PGF replaced one mid-deck locker and operated on 28 V direct current (dc) power. The plant specimen studied in the PGF was &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; (turnip).

== Extra-vehicular activities ==

The Extravehicular Activity Development Flight Test – 05 (EDFT-05) consisted of the payload bay hardware elements of Detailed Test Objective (DTO) 671, EVA Hardware for Future Scheduled Extravehicular Missions. EDFT – 05&#x27;s main objective was to demonstrate International Space Station (ISS) on-orbit, end-to-end EVA assembly, and maintenance operations. The other DTOs included in this test were DTO 672, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Electrical Cuff Checklist and DTO 833, EMU Thermal Comfort, and EVA Worksite Thermal Environment. Another objective was to expand the EVA experience base for ground and flight crews. Two EVA&#x27;s were performed on this mission to accomplish these DTOs.

=== Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera ===
The Autonomous EVA Robotic Camera/Sprint (AERCam/Sprint) was a small, unobtrusive, free-flying camera platform for use outside a spacecraft. The free-flyer had a self-contained cold gas propulsion system giving it the capability to be propelled with 6 degrees of the freedom control system. Onboard the free-flyer were rate sensors to provide data for an automatic attitude hold capability. AERCam/Sprint was a spherical vehicle that moved slowly and was covered in a soft cushioning material to prevent damage in the event of an impact. The design philosophy was to keep the energy low by keeping the velocities and mass low while providing a mechanism to absorb any energy from an impact. The free-flyer platform was controlled from inside the Orbiter by using a small control station. The operator input motion commands from a single, Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) device controller. The commands were sent from the control station to the free-flyer via a Radio Frequency (RF) modem link operating in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) range.

== A comic character in space ==
The mission marked a lesser-known first for having a comic book character being created for a space-going mission, the first to actually fly into space, and the first to safely return to Earth. The sponsor and manager of the Enclosed Laminar Flames experiment, Lewis Stocker, noticed the experiment&#x27;s abbreviation as ELF and, being an avowed reader of the comic book series &quot;Elfquest&quot;, asked the series&#x27; creators Richard and Wendy Pini to create a logo. Originally, he hoped the series&#x27; own stargazer, Skywise, could be used, but to avoid copyright issues, a unique character was created to accompany the experiment insignia, whose name was dubbed Starfire.

==Wake-up calls==

Sleeping shuttle astronauts were often awakened with a short piece of music, a tradition that began during the Gemini and Apollo missions. Each track was specially chosen, sometimes by their families, and usually had a special meaning to an individual member of the crew or was applicable to their daily activities. Astronauts Bill McArthur, Ellen Ochoa, Chris Hadfield, and Marc Garneau were the CAPCOMs for the mission, and called in to &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s astronauts each day.

<doc id="557154" wikidata="Q170376" url="?curid=557154" title="Gabriel Batistuta">
<text>Gabriel Omar Batistuta (; born 1 February 1969) is an Argentine former professional footballer. During his playing career, Batistuta was nicknamed Batigol () as well as El Ángel Gabriel (; Spanish for &quot;Angel Gabriel&quot;). Regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players in 2004.

After beginning his career in Argentina in 1988 with Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, followed by River Plate and Boca Juniors where he won titles, Batistuta played most of his club football with Serie A club Fiorentina in Italy; he is their all-time top scorer in Serie A with 151 goals. When Fiorentina was relegated to Serie B in 1993, Batistuta stayed with the club and helped them return to the top-flight league a year later. He became an icon in Florence; the Fiorentina fans erected a life-size bronze statue of him in 1996, in recognition of his performances for the club. Despite winning the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana with the club in 1996, he never won the Serie A title with Fiorentina, but when he moved to Roma in 2000 for €36 million – the highest fee ever paid for a player over the age of 30 until Cristiano Ronaldo moved from Real Madrid to Juventus in 2018 – he won the 2000–01 Serie A title. After a brief loan spell with Inter Milan in 2003, he played his last two seasons in Qatar with Al-Arabi before he retired in 2005.

At international level, Batistuta was Argentina&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer with 56 goals in 78 official matches, a record he held until 21 June 2016, when he was surpassed by Lionel Messi. He participated in three FIFA World Cups, scoring 10 goals, making him Argentina&#x27;s second top scorer in the competition after Messi, and the joint tenth-highest World Cup goalscorer of all time. Batistuta is the only player in football history to score two hat-tricks in different World Cups. With the Argentina national team he won two consecutive Copa América titles (1991 and 1993), the 1993 CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, and the 1992 FIFA Confederations Cup.

== Personal life ==
Batistuta was born on 1 February 1969 to slaughterhouse worker Omar Batistuta and school secretary Gloria Zilli, in the town of Avellaneda, , but grew up in the nearby city of Reconquista. He has three older sisters, Elisa, Alejandra, and Gabriela. Batistuta is a Roman Catholic. At the age of 16, he met Irina Fernández, his future wife, at her &quot;quinceañera&quot;, a rite of passage on her 15th birthday. On 28 December 1990, they were married at Saint Roque Church.
The couple moved to Florence, Italy, in 1991, and a year later their first son, Thiago, was born. Thanks to good performances in the Italian championship and with the Argentina national team, Batistuta gained fame and respect. He filmed several commercials and was invited onto numerous TV shows, but in spite of this, Batistuta always remained a low-profile family man. In 1997, Batistuta&#x27;s second son, Lucas, was born, and a third son, Joaquín, followed in 1999. He now has a fourth son Shamel. In 2000, Batistuta and his family moved to Rome, where he played for Roma. Two years after Shamel was born, Batistuta was loaned to Inter. In 2003, after 12 years in Italy, the family moved to Qatar where Batistuta had accepted a lucrative celebrity playing contract with a local team, Al-Arabi, ending his career there in 2005. He moved back to Argentina in 2007.

Despite having completed his coaching badges in Argentina, he currently has no involvement with football, instead (primarily as he has difficulty walking) he prefers to play polo and golf, he was quoted saying: &#x27;I don&#x27;t like football, it&#x27;s only my job&#x27;. In later interviews with FIFA he expanded: &quot;I lived and breathed football&quot;, adding, &quot;when I was playing football I never enjoyed it that much, I was never happy ... if I scored two goals, I wanted a third, I always wanted more. Now it&#x27;s all over I can look back with satisfaction, but I never felt that way when I was playing.&quot; In 2006 he expressed an interest in coaching Australia&#x27;s and Argentina&#x27;s national team. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he worked as a commentator for Televisa Deportes. Batistuta currently runs his own construction company in Argentina. He also worked as technical secretary in the professional football club Colón, joining the club&#x27;s staff in January 2012, and leaving at the end of the 2012–13 season.

Speaking in a television interview in Argentina in 2014, Batistuta said the pain suffered in his ankles after retiring in 2005 became so intense that he &quot;urinated in bed with the toilet only a few steps away. I couldn&#x27;t move.&quot; He visited a doctor he knew asking his legs be amputated, but the doctor turned down his request. Although he later underwent surgery to relieve the pressure on his cartilage and tendons and his condition improved slightly, in a 2017 interview, he stated that he still had difficulty walking and faced mobility issues as a result of the stresses and injuries he faced throughout his football career due to overexerting himself. He has, however, still been able to take part in charity football games, and in 2014, he scored twice – one a trademark finish with a powerful 35 yard strike into the roof of the net – in a game in Italy.

Batistuta lived in Perth, Western Australia but due to personal reasons, he moved back to Argentina.

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
As a child, Batistuta preferred other sports to football. Because of his height he played basketball, but after Argentina&#x27;s victory in the 1978 FIFA World Cup, in which he was particularly impressed by the skills of Mario Kempes, he devoted himself to football. After playing with friends on the streets and in the small &quot;Grupo Alegria&quot; club, Batistuta joined the local Platense junior team. While with Platense he was selected for the Reconquista team that won the provincial championship following victory over Newell&#x27;s Old Boys. Batistuta&#x27;s two goals drew the attention of the opposition team&#x27;s coach Marcelo Bielsa, and he signed a professional contract with Newell&#x27;s in 1988.

=== Newell&#x27;s Old Boys ===
At Newell&#x27;s Old Boys under Bielsa, who would later become Batistuta&#x27;s national coach with the Argentina national team, things did not come easily for him during his first year with the club. He was away from home, his family, and his girlfriend Irina, sleeping in a room at the stadium, and had a weight problem that slowed his progress. At the end of that year, Batistuta was loaned to a smaller team, Deportivo Italiano, with whom he participated in the Carnevale Cup in Italy, ending as top scorer with three goals. Under the guidance of Bielsa, whom Batistuta described in his autobiography as the most important coach he has ever had, and &quot;the one who taught me how to train on rainy days, he taught me everything&quot;, he was physically transformed, fed encouragement, and was set on the path into the player he was to become.

=== River Plate ===
In mid-1989, Batistuta made the leap to one of Argentina&#x27;s biggest clubs, River Plate, where he scored 4 goals and River Plate won the Argentine Primera División in 1990. However, he was drawn out of the team by the new manager Daniel Passarella in the mid-season, apparently with no specific reason. According to Batistuta, they never had a dispute. Passarella declared at that time &quot;when Batistuta finds a team that be able to play to him he will be lethal&quot; and highlighted his professionalism.

=== Boca Juniors ===
In 1990, Batistuta joined River Plate&#x27;s arch rivals, Boca Juniors. He initially found it hard to find his best form, in part not playing in his position. However, at the beginning of 1991, Óscar Tabárez became Boca Juniors&#x27; new manager and he gave Batistuta the support and put him into his best place in the field, the centre of attack, rather than as an outside forward. Batistuta finished the season as the league&#x27;s top scorer as Boca Juniors won the championship.

=== Fiorentina ===
While playing for Argentina in the 1991 Copa América, the vice-president of Fiorentina was impressed by Batistuta&#x27;s skills and signed him. He had a fine start in Serie A, scoring 13 goals in his debut season. However, the following season, in 1992–93, Fiorentina lost in the relegation battle and were demoted to Serie B, despite Batistuta&#x27;s 16 league goals. The club returned to Serie A after one season in Serie B, with the contribution of 16 goals from Batistuta and the management of Claudio Ranieri, as Fiorentina captured the 1993–94 Serie B title.

At Fiorentina, Batistuta found his best form. He was the top scorer of the 1994–95 Serie A season with 26 goals, and he broke Ezio Pascutti&#x27;s 32-year-old record by scoring in all of the first 11 matches of the season. In the 1995–96 season, Batistuta, alongside Rui Costa and Francesco Baiano, helped the club to go on a 15-match unbeaten run, as they eventually ended the season with a fourth-place league finish. Fiorentina also won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana over AC Milan; in the two-legged Coppa Italia final against Atalanta, Batistuta scored a goal in each fixture as Fiorentina won 3–0 on aggregate. The next season was less successful, as Fiorentina finished in a disappointing ninth place in the league, although the team managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing out to eventual champions Barcelona, despite scoring a goal in a 1–1 away draw in the first leg. Scoring over 20 league goals in each of the next three seasons – made all the more impressive given Serie A was the strongest league in the world and the hardest to score in with the best defences – as well as spectacular powerful strikes against Arsenal and Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League, Batistuta came third for FIFA World Player of the Year in 1999. Batistuta and Ronaldo were the two best strikers in Serie A, with their duels the most anticipated in Italy.

After his failure to win the Italian championship with Fiorentina, Batistuta started considering a transfer to a bigger team. In an effort to keep Batistuta, Fiorentina hired Giovanni Trapattoni as coach and promised to do everything to win the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. After an excellent start to the season, Batistuta suffered an injury that kept him out of action for more than a month. Losing momentum, Fiorentina lost the lead and finished the season in third place, although the result enabled them to participate in the Champions League the following season.

In addition to the fans erecting a life-size bronze statue of him in Florence, Batistuta was inducted into the club&#x27;s hall of fame in 2014. An emotional Batistuta told the audience at the ceremony: &quot;From the moment I arrived at Fiorentina I wanted a place in the history of the club – and now I can say I have succeeded.&quot;

=== Roma ===

Batistuta stayed at Fiorentina for the 1999–2000 season, tempted by the chance of winning both the Scudetto and the Champions League. After a promising start in both competitions, the team only reached seventh in the league and were eliminated in the second round group phase of the European tournament. The following season, he was transferred to Roma in a deal worth 70 billion lire (€36.2 million) and signed a three-year contract, which earned 14.8 billion Italian lire (€7.6 million) per year before tax. The fee paid for Batistuta became the highest fee ever paid for a player over the age of 30. The record was broken in 2017 when Leonardo Bonucci was signed by AC Milan on a five-year contract for a €42 million fee.

During the 2000–01 season, Batistuta finally garnered a Serie A winners&#x27; medal, scoring 20 league goals, as Roma clinched the Scudetto for the first time since 1983, including a goal in the 3–1 title-deciding victory over Parma on 17 June 2001 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. On 26 November 2000 Batistuta scored an 83rd-minute winner with a right-foot volley from 30 yards in a league game against Fiorentina in Rome – visibly upset having done so he refused to celebrate with his Roma teammates. Before the match he ran over to the 3,000 Fiorentina fans and saluted them, and did the same at full time, receiving adoration in return, before he left the stadium in tears. Sean Ingle, match reporter for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote, &quot;Batistuta breaks Florentine hearts, and his own.&quot; The following season with Roma, he changed his shirt number from 18 to 20 in reference to the number of goals he had scored during the Scudetto winning campaign. He also wore his age on the back of his Roma shirt in 2002, number 33.

==== Loan to Inter Milan ====
Now aged 34, Batistuta failed to find form with Roma and was loaned out to Inter Milan, scoring two goals in twelve matches, although he did provide assists for Christian Vieri. Batistuta sought a move to England to play with Fulham, but the deal never transpired.

=== Al-Arabi ===
He departed Italy for Qatar in 2003, joining Al-Arabi on a free transfer in a deal worth $8 million. Batistuta ended the season by netting 25 goals, thus surpassing the record for most goals scored, which was previously held by Qatari legend Mansour Muftah. Batistuta announced his retirement in 2005.

== International career ==
In 1991, Batistuta was selected to play for Argentina in the Copa América held in Chile, where he finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals as Argentina romped to victory. The following year, he won the FIFA Confederations Cup with Argentina, finishing as the tournament&#x27;s top-scorer. In 1993, Batistuta played in his second Copa América, this time held in Ecuador, which Argentina won with Batistuta scoring both goals in a 2–1 win over Mexico in the final.

The 1994 World Cup, held in the United States, was a disappointment. After a promising start Argentina were beaten by Romania in the last 16. The morale of the team was seriously affected by Diego Maradona&#x27;s doping suspension. Despite the disappointing Argentine exit, Batistuta scored four goals in as many games, including a hat-trick in their opening game against Greece.

During the qualification matches for the 1998 World Cup (with former River Plate manager Daniel Passarella) Batistuta was left out of the majority of the games after falling out with the coach over team rules. The two eventually put the dispute aside and Batistuta was recalled for the tournament. In the game against Jamaica, he recorded the second hat-trick of his World Cup career, becoming the fourth player to achieve this (the others were Sándor Kocsis, Just Fontaine, and Gerd Müller) and the first to score a hat-trick in two World Cups. Argentina were knocked out of the World Cup by the Netherlands courtesy of a last-minute Dennis Bergkamp winner after the two sides had been locked at 1–1 for more than 70 minutes.

After a good series of performances by Argentina in the qualification matches for the 2002 World Cup, hopes were high that the South Americans – now managed by Marcelo Bielsa – could win the trophy, and Batistuta announced that he planned to quit the national team at the end of the tournament, which Argentina aimed to win. But Argentina&#x27;s &quot;group of death&quot; saw the team fall at the first hurdle, only managing a victory against Nigeria (Batistuta scored the match&#x27;s only goal). They later fell to England 1–0 and managed a mere 1–1 tie against Sweden. This meant that the team was knocked out in the opening round for the first time since 1962. With 54 goals from 77 games, Batistuta was the record goalscorer for Argentina, a record he held until it was surpassed by Lionel Messi in 2016. Batistuta admitted he was a little annoyed at losing the record, stating, &quot;You go around the world and people say, &#x27;he&#x27;s the top scorer for the Argentina national team&#x27;, before he then added, &quot;But the advantage I have is that I&#x27;m second to an extraterrestrial.&quot;

== Style of play ==

A quick, hard-working, and powerful player, with an eye for goal and a good all-round game, Batistuta is considered one of the most complete, feared and prolific strikers of his generation. As a striker, he was primarily known for his technique, offensive movement off the ball, strength in the air, and powerful, clinical finishing ability with both feet from anywhere on the pitch, despite being naturally right-footed.
Batistuta also possessed an excellent positional sense, as well as an ability to anticipate defenders in the area, score acrobatic goals from volleys or bicycle kicks, and strike the ball first time from tight angles while on the run. He was also highly regarded due to his accurate heading and powerful free-kick taking abilities; although he was a competent penalty taker, his conversion rate from the spot throughout his career was less reliable. In addition to his skill and goalscoring abilities, Batistuta frequently stood out on the pitch throughout his career due to his leadership and fair-play. Diego Maradona stated that Batistuta is the best striker he has ever seen play the game. Batistuta&#x27;s goal celebration – both arms upturned with his fists clenched – features in his statue placed next to those of Maradona and Messi in an emblematic square in the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires. Batistuta also often celebrated a goal by pretending he was firing a machine gun. Batistuta suffered several injuries throughout his career, which often limited his playing time and fitness, in particular in his later career, which would eventually force him to retire.

<text>The Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature is an annual prize of £3,000 awarded by the Boardman Tasker Charitable Trust to an author or authors for &quot;an original work which has made an outstanding contribution to mountain literature&quot;. The prize was established in 1983 in memory of British climbers Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker, both of whom wrote books about their mountaineering expeditions, after their deaths on the northeast ridge of Mount Everest in 1982. It can be awarded for a piece of fiction or non-fiction, poetry or drama, although the work must have been written in (or translated into) English. The prize is announced at the annual Kendal Mountain Festival.
