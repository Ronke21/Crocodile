<text>The Gathering are a Dutch rock band formed in Oss, North Brabant in 1989. The band&#x27;s lineup currently consists of founding brothers René Rutten (guitars) and Hans Rutten (drums), Silje Wergeland (lead vocals), Hugo Prinsen Geerligs (bass) and Frank Boeijen (keyboards).

The band&#x27;s earliest releases were categorized as atmospheric doom metal with influences from extreme metal acts like Celtic Frost and Hellhammer, undergoing numerous vocalist changes before breaking out in 1995 with &quot;Mandylion&quot;. It was The Gathering&#x27;s first album to feature lead singer Anneke van Giersbergen and the band&#x27;s first to chart in the Netherlands. With van Giersbergen, the band&#x27;s sound shifted from gothic metal to one influenced by shoegaze, post-rock and trip hop, starting with their fifth studio album &quot;How to Measure a Planet?&quot; in 1998.

In 2007, van Giersbergen left the group to focus on her new band Agua de Annique. The band replaced her with Wergeland, of the band Octavia Sperati. The band went on hiatus from 2014 to 2018, and their most recent album, &quot;Beautiful Distortion&quot;, was released on 29 April 2022.

==History==

===Early years (1989–1994)===
Founded by brothers Hans and René Rutten and vocalist Bart Smits, The Gathering formed in the city of Oss in 1989. Soon after they were joined by Hugo Prinsen Geerligs, Jelmer Wiersma and Frank Boeijen to complete their first line-up. The Gathering&#x27;s earliest recordings were categorized as atmospheric doom metal with influences from death metal acts like Celtic Frost and Hellhammer.

In 1990 they recorded a demo tape entitled &quot;An Imaginary Symphony&quot; which met some positive reactions from the underground metal scene due to their unusual use of keyboards in metal-oriented music. A second demo, &quot;Moonlight Archer&quot; was recorded in April 1991, was picked up by several music journalists. Both demos suffered from poor production; however they did help establish the band&#x27;s name on the live circuit opening for bands such as Dead Head, Invocator, Samael, Morbid Angel and Death.

After signing with Foundation 2000, the group released their debut album &quot;Always...&quot; in 1992. On this album, Bart Smits was accompanied by Marike Groot on vocals, who also joined the Gathering on stage for most of the gigs. The album sold nearly 20,000 units over the next few years in Europe. In 1992 both Smits and Groot left the group due to musical differences; the other members wanted to change direction towards a lighter, more progressive sound. Smits went on to form his own project, Wish, to explore a darker, heavier sound.

In 1993 the group recruited two new vocalists, Niels Duffhues and female counterpart Martine van Loon. A second album, &quot;Almost a Dance&quot;, was recorded and released in 1993 by Foundation 2000. The album was met with much criticism aimed at Duffhues&#x27; punk-ish tone being decidedly out of step with the music, and the album was largely written off as a result. The group collectively acknowledged their disappointments with the album and started writing new material and looked for a new vocalist.

===Century Media years (1995–2001)===
In 1995, The Gathering released &quot;Mandylion,&quot; their third album and first to feature lead vocalist Anneke van Giersbergen, through Century Media; proving to be their breakthrough and selling over 130,000 copies in Europe. Two singles were released from &quot;Mandylion&quot;, &quot;Adrenaline/Leaves&quot; and &quot;Strange Machines&quot;, the latter which reached number 37 on the Dutch singles charts and helped raise the group&#x27;s popularity in Europe and the United States. Tours of Belgium and Germany, as well as appearances at the Dynamo Open Air and Pinkpop Festivals further established the bands presence in the European metal scene. 1997&#x27;s &quot;Nighttime Birds&quot; was stylistically and musically a companion piece to &quot;Mandylion&quot; sold over 90,000 copies and saw the group tour throughout Europe.

In 1998 the group acknowledged their growing influences and their need to experiment with a double album, &quot;How to Measure a Planet?&quot;. Produced by Attie Bauw, the album is a radical departure from the group&#x27;s established sound. Upon release, the album received excellent reviews from critics who appreciated the band&#x27;s absorption of new styles such as shoegaze and trip hop into its sound. Positive reactions came from all over the world, including the United States, where they played 14 shows during the summer of 1999.

In 1999 the band formed their own record label, Psychonaut Records, with the view of releasing their own music and taking creative control over how their music is marketed and distributed. &quot;Always...&quot; was re-released in 1999, followed by &quot;Almost a Dance&quot; in 2000, both re-mastered and fitted with new artwork. However, the band were still under contract with Century Media, they released a live album &quot;Superheat&quot; (2000) which was recorded in several Dutch venues during 1999.

Another successful chapter in The Gathering&#x27;s career followed with the release of &quot;if then else&quot; (2000). The album is filled with diverse, intense and emotional rock songs, more compact than its predecessor. Fifteen months of touring ensued, taking them to virtually every nook and cranny of Europe, with a little sidestep to Mexico, and ending with a small Dutch club tour in October 2001.

===Independent years (2002–2008)===

In 2002 the band members took a break and tended to their private lives. During this period, they ended their contract with Century Media. The Gathering had to run their newborn label Psychonaut Records and their 12½-year anniversary was coming up. To celebrate this with their fans, they released the mini-CD &quot;Black Light District&quot; on their own label.

In early 2003, &quot;Souvenirs&quot; was released. &quot;Sleepy Buildings&quot;, a semi-acoustic live album, followed in 2004. This album was the last one featuring Hugo Prinsen Geerligs as the bass player. He was later replaced by Marjolein Kooijman.

In 2005, The Gathering provided the music for a CD-ROM titled &quot;Passengers in Time: The Musical History Tour&quot;. This CD accompanied a history study book written by Professor Wim Kratsborn and the band did not consider it to be an official release of theirs.

The band released a DVD in 2005, entitled &quot;A Sound Relief&quot;. This contained more gentle semi-acoustic songs. But this is not their first DVD. Century Media had released &quot;In Motion&quot; without band permission at 2001. Nevertheless &quot;In Motion &quot; had an acceptable success. The next plan was to release in 2007 a second DVD (recognized for the band) &quot;A Noise Severe&quot; which features the more hard rock sound of The Gathering. This DVD was recorded in Santiago, Chile at 24 March 2007 at the Caupolicán Theatre.

In April 2006 they released their eighth studio album called &quot;Home&quot;. They had toured in March in North and South America and, after a brief pause to let van Giersbergen treat a laryngitis problem, they continued their touring schedule with European dates and music festivals throughout 2006.

The Gathering toured throughout the U.S. and Canada with Lacuna Coil in early 2007. On 5 June 2007, it was announced that Anneke was leaving The Gathering to spend more time with her family and her own band, Agua de Annique. The band scheduled a final tour stop on 4–5 August 2007 at the Ankkarock Festival, Finland. The Ankkarock Festival was announced as the final performance with Anneke as vocalist.

===Silje Wergeland era (2007–present)===

In February 2008, The Gathering released a boxed set entitled &quot;Sand and Mercury - The Complete Century Media Years&quot;. This boxed set was limited to 3000 copies worldwide, and contained 10 discs including a selection of studio, live and compilation albums. The set also contained the audio from the &quot;In Motion&quot; DVD as a new live album, also entitled &quot;In Motion&quot;.

In September 2008, The Gathering released a collection of all their old material from 1989 to 1993 on a double CD. The album contains the demos, the never released promo 1992, live tracks and the Celtic Frost cover of &quot;Dethroned Emperor&quot;. The songs were from the period of the first line-up with singer Bart Smits. All songs were restored and mastered by Mike Wead (King Diamond / Mercyful Fate) and was released by small Dutch independent label Vic Records.

The Gathering&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;The West Pole&quot;, was released in May 2009, shortly after they were joined by a new singer, Silje Wergeland.

On 16 May 2011, the band released the single &quot;Heroes for Ghosts&quot; via their Bandcamp page, as well as announcing a South American tour. The song featured on their forthcoming album.

On 12 September 2012, the band released their tenth studio album, &quot;Disclosure&quot;.

The Gathering celebrated their 25th birthday as a band with two sold-out reunion concerts at Doornroosje in Nijmegen on 9 November 2014. It was the first time that four of their singers (Bart Smits, Marike Groot, Anneke van Giersbergen and Silje Wergeland) performed together, and the band&#x27;s first performance with van Giersbergen since her departure in 2007.

On 8 December 2016, they surprise-released a double-disc of outtakes, demos &amp; unreleased songs from the recordings of &quot;Souvenirs&quot; and &quot;Home&quot;, called &quot;Blueprints&quot;.

In June and November 2018, they played several shows in the Netherlands and did a small tour in Greece.

On 29 April 2022, the band released their eleventh studio album, and first in nearly 10 years, &quot;Beautiful Distortion&quot;.

In December 2024, the band announced that, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Mandylion&quot;, they would reunite with van Giersbergen for five sold-out August 2025 shows in Nijmegen.

==Etymology==
Frank Boeijen on the origins of the name of the band:

&quot;The name the Gathering has been made like eleven years ago when we started this band. We were all between 15 and 17. We were watching a lot of movies those days. One of the movies spoke about immortality and that you could kill the immortals with cutting their head off [it&#x27;s the first &quot;Highlander&quot; Frank is speaking about]. In the first part of the movie, they speak a lot about the gathering. There will be a gathering once with all the immortals. We thought it was a nice name for a band, and that&#x27;s how we created this name. And you can feel it&#x27;s a cool name for five people who come together to make fine music.&quot; &quot;[sic]&quot;

<doc id="535143" wikidata="Q555490" url="?curid=535143" title="Franco Franchi">
<text>Francesco Benenato (18 September 1928 – 9 December 1992), known as Franco Franchi, was an Italian actor, comedian and singer.

He was born in Palermo, Sicily and began his career in the 1950s, although his career only really took off in the 1960s. He starred in many comedies, mainly appearing together with Ciccio Ingrassia as the comedy duo Franco and Ciccio, but also in more dramatic material such as Luigi Comencini&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (1972), in which they paired memorably as the Fox and the Cat.

In the film &quot;War Italian Style&quot; (1966), he worked with Buster Keaton and Ciccio Ingrassia.

==The comedy duo Franco and Ciccio==
In 1959, Franco Franchi settled a contract with his friend Ciccio Ingrassia which started up a brilliant theater career. From 1961 to Franco&#x27;s death in 1992, they will be one of Italy&#x27;s most famous comedy duo. Their success is based on a format similar to that of Totò and Peppino De Filippo, or Laurel and Hardy. They play two Sicilian buffoon characters, charlatans and extremely messy, were Franco Franchi is the funny &quot;Franco&quot;, a young man completely out of his mind who expresses himself mainly through bodily and facial expressions. Ciccio Ingrassia is the skinny and mustachioed bully who believes to be his best of friend, but is actually during difficult situations proves to be the most stupid of the two. A feature of their commercial success and popularity is the use of the body as a means of communication and simple lines, sharp and not at all vulgar.&lt;br&gt;With these tricks up its sleeve, as both actors will be challenged in youth theater, Franco and Ciccio thanks to their friend Domenico Modugno began to pursue a film career as extras. Then they are noticed by directors of small comedy and so their film career begins. In all years, the two actors churn out at least ten films, working at a pace unimaginable today. In fact, because these days very fast film products are among the best. And unfortunately the criticism then he cut down every film of Franco and Ciccio coming out to the movies, calling it useless and meaningless pecoreccio comedian. However, the popular success of films of Franco and Ciccio was huge and always has been until now in Italy and also in foreign countries.&lt;br&gt;The specialty of the many films of Franco and Ciccio is improvisation during the scenes, as did Toto and De Filippo, but also the use of parody. In fact there are many foreign films chosen by the two above you to pluck a fun comedy, as the saga of James Bond and that of the great adventure films.

<text>Pet Sematary is a 1983 horror novel by American writer Stephen King. The novel was nominated for a World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1984, and adapted into two films: one in 1989 and another in 2019. In November 2013, PS Publishing released &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; in a limited 30th-anniversary edition.

== Plot ==
Louis Creed, a doctor from Chicago, is appointed director of the University of Maine&#x27;s campus health service. He moves to a house near the town of Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their two young children, Ellie and Gage, and Ellie&#x27;s cat, Winston Churchill (&quot;Church&quot;). Their elderly neighbor, Jud Crandall, warns Louis and Rachel about the highway that runs past their house, which is frequented by speeding trucks.

Jud and Louis become close friends, with Louis viewing Jud as a surrogate father as Louis&#x27; own father died when he was three years old. Jud takes the family on a walk in the woods behind their home. A well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled &quot;sematary&quot; on the sign), where the children of the town bury their deceased animals. 

Victor Pascow, a student fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to Louis personally, though they are strangers. On the night following Pascow&#x27;s death, Louis dreams that he meets Pascow&#x27;s ghost, who leads him to the deadfall at the back of the &quot;sematary&quot; and warns him not to go beyond that point. Louis wakes up in bed the next morning to find his feet and bedsheets covered with dried mud and pine needles. 

Ellie&#x27;s cat, Church, is run over around Thanksgiving. Rachel and the children are visiting Rachel&#x27;s parents in Chicago, and Louis frets over breaking the bad news to Ellie. Jud takes him to the &quot;sematary&quot;, supposedly to bury Church. Instead of stopping there, Jud leads Louis farther on to &quot;the real cemetery&quot;: an ancient burial ground that was once used by the Mi&#x27;kmaq. Louis buries the cat on Jud&#x27;s instruction. The next afternoon, Church returns home; the usually vibrant and lively cat now acts ornery and, in Louis&#x27;s words, &quot;a little dead&quot;. Church hunts for mice and birds, ripping them apart without eating them. He also smells so bad that Ellie no longer wants him in her room at night. Jud confirms that Church has been resurrected and that Jud buried his dog there when he was younger. Louis, deeply disturbed, begins to wish that he had not buried Church there.

Several months later, two-year-old Gage is killed by a speeding truck. Overcome with despair, Louis considers bringing his son back to life with the help of the burial ground. Jud attempts to dissuade him by telling him the story of Timmy Baterman, the last person resurrected by the burial ground. After being killed in action during World War II, Timmy&#x27;s body was shipped back to the United States, and his father Bill buried Timmy in the burial ground. Timmy returned malevolent, terrorizing the people of the town with secrets that Jud asserts he had no way of knowing. Timmy was stopped by Bill, who killed Timmy and set their house on fire before shooting himself. Jud believes that whatever came back was not Timmy, but a &quot;demon&quot; that had possessed his corpse. He concludes that &quot;sometimes, dead is better&quot; and states that &quot;the place has a power... its own evil purpose&quot;, and that it may have caused Gage&#x27;s death because Jud introduced Louis to it.

Despite Jud&#x27;s warning and his own reservations, Louis&#x27;s grief and guilt spur him to exhume Gage&#x27;s body from his grave and inter him in the burial ground. Now malicious in both his words and actions, the resurrected Gage finds one of Louis&#x27;s scalpels and kills Jud and Rachel. Louis kills Church and Gage with lethal injections of morphine.

Louis, driven insane by grief, burns the Crandall house down before returning to the burial ground with his wife&#x27;s corpse, thinking that if he buries the body faster than he did Gage&#x27;s, there will be a different result. One of his colleagues, Steve Masterton, notices him walking into the woods with Rachel&#x27;s body. Steve, while fearful and concerned, is influenced by the power of the burial ground, and even considers helping Louis bury Rachel, but he flees in terror and eventually moves to St. Louis. Louis sits indoors alone, playing solitaire, when Rachel&#x27;s reanimated corpse walks up behind him and drops a cold hand on his shoulder, while its voice rasps, &quot;Darling.&quot;

==Background==
In 1979, King was a &quot;writer-in-residence&quot; at the University of Maine and the house his family was renting in Orrington, Maine, was adjacent to a major road where dogs and cats were often killed by oncoming trucks. After his daughter&#x27;s cat was killed by a truck along that road, he explained the death of the pet to his daughter and buried the cat. Three days later, King imagined what would happen if a family suffered the same tragedy but the cat came back to life &quot;fundamentally wrong&quot;. He then imagined what would happen if that family&#x27;s young son were also killed by a passing truck. He decided to write a book based on these ideas, and that the book would be a re-telling of &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; (1902), a short story by W. W. Jacobs about parents whose son resurrects after they wish for that to happen. The first draft was completed in May 1979. In June 1983, King published a short story, &quot;The Return of Timmy Baterman&quot;, in the program for the event &quot;Satyricon II&quot; (also known as &quot;DeepSouthCon 21&quot;); this was incorporated into &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;. King has gone on record stating that of all the novels he has written, &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; is the one which genuinely scared him the most.

== Adaptations ==

=== Films ===
The first film adaptation was released in 1989. Directed by Mary Lambert, it starred Dale Midkiff as Louis, Fred Gwynne as Jud, Denise Crosby as Rachel, Brad Greenquist as Victor, Miko Hughes as Gage, and twins Blaze Berdahl and Beau Berdahl as Ellie. King wrote the screenplay and had a cameo as a minister. Male actor Andrew Hubatsek portrayed Zelda because the filmmakers felt that a grown man playing a disabled, deformed teenage girl would make the character more hideous and frightening. The film received mixed reviews, but it was a commercial success. A sequel, &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot;, was released in 1992.

A second film adaptation of the novel was released on April 5, 2019. Directed by Dennis Widmyer and Kevin Kölsch, the film stars Jason Clarke as Louis Creed, Amy Seimetz as Rachel Creed, John Lithgow as Jud Crandall, Jeté Laurence as Ellie Creed, and twins Hugo Lavoie and Lucas Lavoie as Gage Creed. A prequel to the 2019 film was green-lit in February 2021 after producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura laid out plans for a prequel prior to the release of the 2019 film. &quot;Pet Sematary: Bloodlines&quot; was released on October 6, 2023, as a Paramount+ exclusive release. Taking place fifty years prior, the film follows a young Jud Crandall played by Jackson White.

On December 7, 2021, director Guillermo del Toro said that he would love to make his own version of &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, saying, &quot;You know the novel that I would have killed to adapt, and I know there&#x27;s two versions of it, and I still think maybe in a deranged universe I get to do it again one day is &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;. Because it not only has the very best final couple of lines, but it scared me when I was a young man. As a father, I now understand it better than I ever would have, and it scares me a hundred times more.&quot; Del Toro also pointed out scenes from King&#x27;s book that were left out of both film versions. &quot;For me, the best scene in that book is when [Louis] opens Gage&#x27;s coffin, and for a second he thinks the head is gone, because this black fungi from the grave has grown like a fuzz over the kid&#x27;s face. [...] I think you cannot spare those details and think that you&#x27;re honoring that book. One of the things I thought about &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; that we would do in post is when the dead return, when Gage returns, I&#x27;d spend an inordinate amount of money taking out the sheen from his eyes. So that the eyes are dull.&quot;

=== Radio ===

In 1997, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatization of the story in six half-hour episodes, later re-edited into three hour-long episodes. It was adapted by Gregory Evans and starred John Sharian as Louis Creed, Briony Glassco as Rachel Creed and Lee Montague as Jud Crandall. The production was directed by Gordon House.

=== Music ===
The Ramones recorded a song of the same name as the theme for the 1989 film adaptation. It appeared on their album &quot;Brain Drain&quot;. It was later covered by the band Starcrawler for the 2019 film.

Ice Nine Kills recorded a song called Funeral Derangements based of off the book and the movie. A music video was released, being an adaptation of the story.

<doc id="535147" wikidata="Q660484" url="?curid=535147" title="Newton Abbot">
<text>Newton Abbot is a market town and civil parish on the River Teign in the Teignbridge District of Devon, England. Its population was 24,029 in 2011, and was estimated at 26,655 in 2019. It grew rapidly in the Victorian era as the home of the South Devon Railway locomotive works. This later became a major steam engine shed, retained to service British Railways diesel locomotives until 1981. It now houses the Brunel industrial estate. The town has a race course nearby, the most westerly in England, and a country park, Decoy. It is twinned with Besigheim in Germany and Ay in France.

==Toponymy==
Newton Abbot does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is first documented in the late 12th century in Latin as &quot;Nova Villa&quot;: &quot;new farm&quot;. In 1201 it was recorded as &quot;Nieweton&#x27; abbatis&quot;: &quot;New settlement belonging to the abbot&quot;. The land was granted to Torre Abbey by William de Briwere in 1196.

Robert Bussell acquired the area in the Highweek parish and Teignbridge Hundred, which was then Newton Bushel. The twin towns worked together and their markets were eventually combined. Local noted antiquarian Cecil Torr states that the town continued to be known simply as Newton or Newton Bushel to the majority of people prior to the arrival of the railway, which named the station Newton Abbot in order to distinguish it from other towns called Newton on the railway network.

Even after the arrival of the railway, the mononym &quot;Newton&quot; remained in common use, with Richard Nicholls Worth noting in 1880 that &quot;Newton is a modern development of the ancient towns of Newton Abbot and Newton Bushell, which the railway has made into an important centre&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
Traces of Neolithic inhabitants have been found at Berry&#x27;s Wood Hill Fort near Bradley Manor. This was a contour hill fort that enclosed about . Milber Down camp was built before the 1st century BC and later occupied briefly by the Romans, whose coins have been found there.

Highweek Hill has the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, known as Castle Dyke. A village grew up around the castle, first called Teignwick, and later Highweek, implying a village on the high ground. Another settlement developed on the low ground around the River Lemon and would become part of Wolborough Manor.

===The markets===
There has been a thriving market in Newton Abbot for over 750 years – the first market charter was granted in 1220.

The New Town of the Abbots (of Torre Abbey) was given the right some time between 1247 and 1251 to hold a weekly market on Wednesdays. By 1300 the two settlements were renamed as Newton Abbot (taking the low ground) and Newton Bushel (taking the high ground). On the strength of the market, it quickly became a thriving town and a good source of income for the Abbots.

Over the river, on the Highweek side, another weekly market was created. This one was on Tuesdays; and because the Bushel family were the landowners this community became known as Newton Bushel. Over the next 200 years Newton Bushel ran more annual fairs, a number of mills were set up, and the leather and wool trades started. Newton Bushel was also a convenient place for travellers to stay. Torre Abbey was dissolved in 1539 and ownership of Wolborough was granted to John Gaverock, who built himself a new house at Forde.

The twin markets of Newton Abbot and Newton Bushel continued until they were merged in 1633 as a Wednesday weekly market under the control of Bradley Manor. By 1751 it had been joined by a smaller Saturday market and three annual fairs: a cattle fair on 24 June, a cheese and onion fair in September, and a cloth fair on 6 November. The markets continued to expand, and in 1826 a new market place was built. But over the next 50 years the buildings became dilapidated, and a new corn exchange (now the Alexandra Theatre) and market hall were completed in 1871.

===Wool and leather===
In medieval times Devon was an important sheep-rearing county. Many towns had their own wool and cloth industries and Newton Abbot had woollen mills, fullers, dyers, spinners, weavers and tailors. In particular, fellmongering (where wool is completely removed from the sheepskin) was well established in the town. In 1724 Daniel Defoe wrote that Newton Abbot had a thriving serge industry that sent goods to Holland via Exeter. The annual cloth fair was the town&#x27;s busiest fair. Over the 19th century, Vicary&#x27;s mills became an important employer in the town and by the 1920s was employing over 400 men. However, by 1972 business had declined and the works closed down.

Associated with the woollen industry was the leather business. Hides left after the fell-mongering process were made into leather. Tanners, boot and shoemakers, glovers and saddlers were all in business in Newton Abbot. As with the wool industry, business flourished over 600 years until after the Second World War.

===The Newfoundland trade===
In 1583 Humphrey Gilbert, a local adventurer landed at St. John&#x27;s in Newfoundland and claimed the area as an English colony. The fisheries quickly developed. Between 1600 and 1850 there was a steady trade between Newton Abbot and the cod fisheries off Newfoundland. Every year men from the town would gather at the &quot;Dartmouth Inn&quot; or &quot;Newfoundland Inn&quot; in East Street in the hope of being hired for a season&#x27;s work. In the autumn the dried cod was stored in depots and sometimes used as payment. There was a considerable economic spin-off from this trade. Fish hooks, knives, waterproof boots and rope were all made in the town. The Rope Walk in East Street just a few yards from the Cider Bar still exists, together with the names Newfoundland Way and St John&#x27;s Street.

===Ball clay and the Stover Canal===
Just north-west of Newton Abbot lie the large ball clay workings of the Bovey Basin. The main workings are on the eastern outcrop of the deposits at Kingsteignton, which can lay claim to being the centre of Britain&#x27;s ball-clay industry. The Bovey Basin took millions of years to fill from rivers that flowed out of Dartmoor. The sediments included clay derived from the decomposed granite. The natural deposition has resulted in clay that is purer and more refined than many others. Clay is used in a wide range of products such as bricks, tyres, porcelain, medicines and toothpaste.

Kingsteignton clay was being used to make pipes around 1680. By 1700, it was being shipped from Teignmouth, and its utilisation by the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood bred success. The clay was extracted by simply digging out the lumps on courses; rather like peat cutting. The bulky clay was transported by packhorse to Hackney Quay at Kingsteignton, then loaded onto barges for shipment down the Teign Estuary, where it was transferred to small ships bound for Liverpool and other ports.

Towards the end of the 18th century, the ball-clay industry was steadily expanding. A local landowner, James Templer, built the Stover Canal in 1792 to help ship clay along the canal and the Teign Estuary from the Bovey Basin to the port of Teignmouth. Coal, manure and agricultural produce were also shipped along the canal. James Templer&#x27;s father, also called James Templer, purchased the Stover Estate near Newton Abbot in 1765. Granite from Hay Tor was used to build Stover House which was completed by 1792. George Templer, son of James Templer (the second) and brother of Rev. John Templer, rector of Teigngrace, built the Haytor Granite Tramway, which had rails cut from granite, connecting the granite quarries of Haytor to the canal. This was completed by 1820 and enabled large quantities of granite to be transported for major works like the new London Bridge which opened in 1825. However, George Templer overspent his resources and was forced to sell Stover House, Stover Canal, the Haytor Granite Tramway and most of the rest of the family&#x27;s considerable estates to Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset, in 1829. The canal was extended to cope with this, and the industry fared well until 1858 when they were out-competed by the more economic Cornish coastal quarries. The Stover canal reverted to shipping ball clay, but had ceased to do so by 1939.

The ball-clay industry is now highly mechanised and successful. Most of the clay is transported by road and transferred to ships at the nearby port of Teignmouth.

The Stover Canal Society was formed after a public meeting in February 1999, with the aim of preserving and restoring the canal. Railtrack, which owned most of the canal, transferred ownership in 2005 for the sum of £1 to Teignbridge District Council for leisure use by the community. Work then continued to restore it as an amenity.

===The railway===

The South Devon railway reached Newton Abbot in 1846 and changed it from simply a market town with associated trades (leather and wool) into an industrial base. The South Devon Railway Company opened the station on 30 December 1846. A branch to Torquay was added on 18 December 1848, with one to Moretonhampstead on 26 June 1866, although the latter has since closed to passengers. Isambard Kingdom Brunel used the Teignmouth/Newton Abbot section to experiment with his atmospheric railway. The experiment failed, but the remains of Brunel&#x27;s pumping house survive at Starcross and the old Dairy Crest milk processing factory in Totnes.

In 1876, the Great Western Railway bought up the railways and developed the repair and maintenance sheds into a substantial works. Extensive sidings were also built making a large marshalling yard. The present station was rebuilt to its current form in 1927 to designs by Chief GWR Architect P. E. Culverhouse. The large clock was a gift from the people of the town.

During the late 1980s, the number of passenger platforms was reduced from around nine down to five, and only three of these are still used for scheduled trains. The remaining platforms were shortened on the southern side and the number of tracks reduced to make way for a new station car park. The South Devon Railway Engineering works was decommissioned and replaced by Brunel Industrial Estate. Of the two buildings that survived into the 21st century, only one remains intact, as the old sheds burned down on 21 October 2018.

Many other industries were set up beside the railway station, including a timber yard, iron and brass foundries, and an engineering works. Newton Abbot power station was built adjacent to the line on the Moretonhampstead branch. The town&#x27;s population increased from 1,623 in 1801 to 12,518 by 1901. Terraced streets were built to house the workers, and attractive villas sprang up around the town for the wealthier.

===Modern history===
Two Royal Navy personnel from Newton Abbot were among the first British casualties in World War I, being killed after their ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat. Over the course of the two world wars, more than 250 Newtonian men gave their lives for the British Empire. They are remembered on the town&#x27;s war memorial. a further eleven Commonwealth soldiers are also buried in the town. The town was bombed from the air twice during World War II, killing a total of 21 people. There was a severe flood on 27 December 1979, the latest in a long series, when the River Lemon burst its banks after prolonged rain.

Tucked into a corner of the racecourse, Newton Abbot&#x27;s stock-car track flourished for nearly 30 years and attracted fans and drivers from all over the South of England. A short 300-metre oval track, it featured races for the cars of the BriSCA organization, as well as saloons and &quot;bangers&quot;.

A new community hospital to replace the one in East Street was built at the end of Jetty Marsh Road and opened on 12 January 2009.

The Flag of Newton Abbot was adopted in 2009 by the town council. It depicts a stylised image of St Leonard&#x27;s Tower in the centre of a modified flag of Devon. Henry Cole, of Newton Abbot Town Council, stated that the &quot;green represents the moors, black for the granite and white for the clay&quot; of the surrounding area. The cross of St Petroc is also used to represent a major crossroads in the town which converged on the clock tower. The arm of the cross represent the routes to Exeter and London, Bovey Tracey and the moors, Totnes and Plymouth, and Torquay and Brixham.

In 2023, a survey by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Newton Abbot as one of the ugliest towns in Britain.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Newton Abbot, at parish, district and county level: Newton Abbot Town Council, Teignbridge District Council and Devon County Council.
The town council, which was previously based at the old town hall in Devon Square, is now based at Newton&#x27;s Place at 43 Wolborough Street, which had been built in 1835 as St Leonard&#x27;s Church (replacing the nearby medieval church of the same name which was demolished shortly afterwards apart from its tower). The former church at 43 Wolborough Street was converted to a museum, community space and town council headquarters, with the first council meeting in the building being held in June 2021. The building was formally opened on 1 April 2023. Teignbridge District Council also has its offices in the town, at Forde House.

Newton Abbot was historically part of the parish of Wolborough. A local government district covering the parish was established in 1864, governed by the Wolborough Local Board. Such local boards were reconstituted as urban district councils in 1894. Ahead of that change, the outgoing local board requested a change of name from Wolborough to Newton Abbot, recognising that Newton Abbot was the main settlement in the district, and so the Wolborough Local Board was replaced by Newton Abbot Urban District Council. The urban district was enlarged in 1901 to take in the parish of Highweek (which included the town&#x27;s suburb of Newton Bushel on the north bank of the River Lemon) and the Milber area east of the Aller Brook, which had previously been in the parish of Haccombe with Combe. From 1901 to 1974 the Newton Abbot Urban District covered the three civil parishes of Wolborough, Highweek and Milber. As urban parishes the three parishes did not have their own parish councils, but were administered directly by Newton Abbot Urban District Council.

Newton Abbot Urban District was abolished in 1974 with the area becoming part of the new district of Teignbridge. A successor parish called Newton Abbot was established covering the whole of the former urban district, with its council taking the name Newton Abbot Town Council.

Newton Abbot is the main town in the Newton Abbot parliamentary constituency. The constituency was created in 2010, when it was won by the Conservative, Anne-Marie Morris. However, Morris was subsequently unseated by the Liberal Democrat, Martin Wrigley at the 2024 general election.

Newton Abbot has two seats on Devon County Council, for Newton Abbot North and Newton Abbot South.

==Education==
Coombeshead Academy is a comprehensive school in Coombeshead Road. It is a trust school and a specialist media and arts college for some 1,442 pupils aged 11 to 18.

Newton Abbot College, also a comprehensive school in Old Exeter Road. It came into being on 1 September 2008 as a renaming of Knowles Hill School. It is a specialist Technology College for around 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 18.

==Areas==
The Newton Abbot civil parish has grown to include the areas of Highweek (to the north-west) and Wolborough (to the south). Other areas and suburbs include Abbotsbury, Aller Park, Broadlands, Buckland, Knowles Hill, Milber, Mile End and Newtake.

==Climate==
==Landmarks==
===Alexandra Theatre===
The Alexandra Theatre was originally built in 1871 as a corn exchange at the end of the market building. Before it was finished, it was decided instead to use it as a meeting hall for the community. It remained as such until in 1883, when a major upgrade of the building included the addition of a stage with dressing rooms below, further dressing rooms in extensions at the side of the main building and an orchestra pit. Many other alterations followed until it was converted into a two-screen cinema in 1996.

===St Leonard&#x27;s Tower===
The centre of the town features the ancient tower of St Leonard; it is all that remains of the medieval chapel of St Leonard, founded in 1220 and first referred to in 1350 in a document of the Bishop de Grandisson of Exeter. The main chapel was demolished in 1836 to ease traffic congestion. Adjacent to the tower is a plaque marking where the first declaration of the newly arrived William III, Prince of Orange was read in 1688: The first declaration of William III, Prince of Orange, the glorious defender of the Protestant religion and the liberties of England, was read on this pedestal by the Rev. John Reynell, rector of this parish, 5th November, 1688. Although William arrived in Brixham on 5 November, he did not reach Newton Abbot until 6 November, when he stayed overnight at Forde House as he made his way to London to take the English throne.

The tower can regularly be seen flying the Union Flag or the Flag of Newton Abbot (The Flag of Devon defaced by the silhouette of the tower).

===Forde House===

Forde House (now known as &quot;Old Forde House&quot;) lies in the south-east corner of the town in the parish of Wolborough. The present house was built in 1610 by Richard Reynell (who later became Sir Richard Reynell) and his wife Lucy. It was built with an E-shaped floor plan thought to be in honour of Queen Elizabeth I, who had recently died. The grounds were originally extensive, including all of what is called Decoy (as wildfowl were decoyed there to extend the house&#x27;s larder), a deer park known locally as &quot;Buckland&quot;, which is now home to a housing estate, and the trampoline park.

In 1625, King Charles I stayed at the house overnight on his way to inspect the fleet at Plymouth. He returned a few days later for a further two nights. Forde House gave shelter to Oliver Cromwell and Colonel Fairfax while on their way to besiege Royalist Dartmouth in 1646. In 1648 the estate passed to the Courtenay family through the marriage of Margaret (only daughter of Jane Reynell and Sir William Waller) to Sir William Courtenay, lord of nearby Powderham Castle. William of Orange stayed at the house in 1688 on the way to his coronation in London, having landed in Brixham. The house remained the main residence of a succession of Courtenays until 1762, when it was let to a string of occupiers.

The Courtenay family sold the house in 1936 to Stephen Simpson, who sold it two years later to Mrs M. Sellick. Teignbridge District Council bought the house in 1978 and remains the current owners. It has been refurbished for use as office and conference space, and for weddings and other social events.

===Bradley Manor===

At the opposite end of Newton Abbot is a National Trust property, Bradley Manor. This 15th-century (c. 1420) manor house in a secluded woodland setting has a notable great hall emblazoned with the royal coat of arms of Elizabeth I. Nearby is Bakers Park.

The Great Western Railway named a 7800 class steam locomotive after the manor, but the engine was never based in Newton Abbot (shed code: 83A) and was withdrawn from mainline service in the 1965. It was restored in the 1980s and passed through Newton Abbot on special runs called &quot;The Torbay Express&quot; and &quot;The Mayflower&quot;.

===Passmore Edwards Public Library===
John Passmore Edwards originally wanted a hospital built for the town in memory of his mother, who was born there, but as the town already had a hospital, he decided on a public library, which opened in 1904. The building, designed by the Cornish architect Silvanus Trevail, is among the most impressive in Newton Abbot. It originally housed a Science, Art and Technical School, which the council added. The elaborate Renaissance style includes yellow terracotta mouldings over windows and doorways. Passmore Edwards donated £2,500, and the County Council and public donations paid for the rest. Renovated in 2010–2012, it was renamed the &quot;Passmore Edwards Centre&quot; after its benefactor and to reflect its future as a multi-purpose facility. It works closely with Coombeshead Academy.

===Almshouses===
The several sets of almshouses in Newton Abbot include:
* Gilberd&#x27;s in Exeter Road were endowed in 1538 by John Gilberd of Compton Castle to house lepers. The five houses reputedly had sloping floors to help in washing out the houses. Eight modern apartments with a common room and visitors bedroom now occupy the site, administered by the Feoffees of Highweek.
* In 1576, Robert Hayman set up several houses for the poor in East Street; these were rebuilt in 1840.
* Reynell&#x27;s almshouses, built in 1640 beside Torquay Road, housed four clergy widows (&quot;the relicts of preaching ministers, left poor, without a house of their own&quot;). They were rebuilt in 1845.
* Mackrell&#x27;s almshouses in Wolborough Street were built in 1874 by J. W. Rowell. Mackrell was a native of Newton Abbot who made his fortune as a chemist in Barnstaple. Mackrell also funded a home in the Forde Park area for the &quot;fallen women of Newton Abbot&quot;, housing single mothers fallen on hard times.

===The workhouse===
The original Newton Abbot poorhouse was in East Street. The cellar of the &quot;Devon Arms&quot; was used as the oakum picking room, where paupers were given the unpleasant job of untwisting old rope to provide oakum, used to seal the seams of wooden boats. Newton Bushel had its own poorhouse, not far from present day Newton Abbot Leisure Centre, previously known as &quot;Dyron&#x27;s&quot;.

The 1834 Poor Law Act required changes and incorporation that led, in 1839, to a new workhouse being built in East Street for paupers from surrounding areas. In time, the workhouse became more of a hospital for the sick, infirm and aged poor.

===Tucker&#x27;s Maltings===

Close to the railway station is the former Tucker&#x27;s Maltings, long the only traditional malthouse in the UK open to the public. The malt house produced malt for over 30 breweries and enough to brew of beer &quot;per annum&quot;. Although closing as a malthouse in 2018, the maltings is now home to a number of businesses, including The Maltings Taphouse, a craft beer bar and cultural venue.

===Cider bar===

Said to be one of only two remaining cider houses in the United Kingdom, Ye Olde Cider Bar in East Street sells only cider, perry, country wines and soft drinks. Its interior and simple wooden furniture remain relatively unchanged, but some old bar customs, such as limiting women and holidaymakers to half-pint measures and covering the floor with sawdust, have ceased.

===Newton Abbot Town &amp; GWR Museum===
After a 2019 relocation, the museum is now in the Newton&#x27;s Place community centre in Newfoundland Way. It displays the history of Newton Abbot and of the Great Western Railway.

===Newton Abbot War Memorial===

In 1922, Newton Abbot Urban District Council instructed its borough surveyor, Coleridge Dingley White, to design a town memorial reflecting the town&#x27;s importance and the contribution of its young men to the war effort The unveiling and dedication took place on Sunday 23 July 1922.

The town has a long-standing rugby union club, Newton Abbot RFC (established 1873), which plays home games at Rackerhayes in nearby Kingsteignton.

Two greyhound racing tracks existed; the Newton Abbot Greyhound Track lasted from 1974 to 2005 and a short-lived track was laid on the Recreation Ground, where Newton Abbot Spurs plays today. The racing was independent (unaffiliated to the sports governing body, the National Greyhound Racing Club) and so both were known as flapping tracks, a name given to independent tracks. Distances there were 250, 450 and 460 yards and racing lasted about five years.

<text>Brodmann area 21, or BA21, is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. The region encompasses most of the lateral temporal cortex and is also known as middle temporal area 21. In the human it corresponds approximately to the middle temporal gyrus.

==Function==
BA 21 is a higher-order visual association cortex with medium myelin content. As a lateral temporal region, it is likely to play a part in auditory processing and language. Language function is left lateralized in most individuals.

==Location==
BA21 is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of the cerebral cortex.
BA21 is superior to BA20 and inferior to BA40 and BA41. It is bounded rostrally by the temporopolar area 38 (H), ventrally by the inferior temporal area 20, caudally by the occipitotemporal area 37 (H), and dorsally by the superior temporal area 22 (Brodmann-1909).

==Guenon==
Brodmann area 21 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is cytoarchitecturally homologous to the middle temporal area 21 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): Compared to area 20 of Brodmann-1909, the total cortical thickness of area 21 is greater, the granular cells are less abundant, and the boundary with the subcortical white matter is less distinct; the molecular layer (I) is wider; the pyramidal cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) are larger; the internal granular layer (IV) is less developed and contains fewer cells; ganglion cells of the internal pyramidal layer (V) are larger, rounder, and densely arrayed adjacent to layer IV; the boundary between layer V and the multiform layer (VI) is indistinct; and layer VI is wider and has no sublayers.

<doc id="535179" wikidata="Q1426922" url="?curid=535179" title="Ifá">
<text>Ifá or Fá is a divination system originating from Yorubaland in West Africa. It originates within the traditional religion of the Yoruba people although is also practised by followers of West African Vodun and in African diasporic religions like Cuban Santería.

According to Ifá teaching, the divinatory system is overseen by an &quot;orisha&quot; spirit, Orunmila, who is believed to have given it to humanity. Ifá is organised as an initiatory tradition, with an initiate called a &quot;babaláwo&quot; or &quot;bokɔnɔ&quot;. Traditionally, these are all-male, although women have been initiated in Cuba and Mexico.
Its oracular literary body is made up of 256 volumes (signs) that are divided into two categories, the first called Ojú Odù or main Odù that consists of 16 chapters. The second category is composed of 240 chapters called Amúlù Odù (omoluos), these are composed through the combination of the main Odù. They use either the divining chain known as &quot;Ọ̀pẹ̀lẹ̀&quot;, or the sacred palm (&quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot;) or kola nuts called &quot;Ikin&quot;, on the wooden divination tray called &quot;Ọpọ́n Ifá&quot; to mathematically calculate which Odu to use for what problem.

Ifá is first recorded among the Yoruba people of West Africa. The expansion of Yoruba influence over neighbouring peoples resulted in the spread of Ifá, for instance to Fon people practising West African Vodun. As a result of the Atlantic slave trade, enslaved initiates of Ifá were transported to the Americas. There, Ifá survived in Cuba, where it developed an overlap with Afro-Cuban religious traditions such as Santería and Abakuá. Growing transnational links between Africa and the Americas during the 1970s also saw attempts by West African &quot;babalawos&quot; to train and initiate people in countries like Brazil and the United States.

==Definitions==

There are regional differences in the system. In West Africa there are both Yoruba and Fon versions of the practice, the latter commonly called Fá. The Yoruba system of Ifá is deemed more time consuming, and requires more sacrifices, than the Fá system among the Fon. In the Fon-dominated Ouidah, therefore, some people think of Yoruba Ifá as being more potent than their own local system. Some people who have been initiated into Fon-style Fá thus later go through additional ceremonies to be initiated into Yoruba-style Ifá.

==Belief==

===Theology===
In Yorubaland, divination gives priests unreserved access to the teachings of Ọ̀rúnmìlà. Among the Fon, Ọ̀rúnmìlà is known as Fá.

Eshu is the one said to lend &quot;ashe&quot; to the oracle during provision of direction and/or clarification of counsel. Eshu is also the one that holds the keys to one&#x27;s &quot;ire&quot; (fortune or blessing) and thus acts as Oluwinni (one&#x27;s Creditor): he can grant &quot;ire&quot; or remove it. Ifá divination rites provide an avenue of communication to the spiritual realm and the intent of one&#x27;s destiny.

Among the Fon, it is the female spirit Gbădu who is regarded as the source of Fá&#x27;s power. She is deemed to be the wife of Fá.
Her presence is required for new initiations. She is believed to offer significant protection for people but her veneration is thought dangerous unless a person is initiated. It is for instance believed that women must be kept apart from her presence, for if they get near her they may be struck barren or die.

==System==

===Odù Ifá===

Ifá consists of 256 binary signs. The Yoruba term &quot;odù&quot; instead appears in Fon as a &quot;dù&quot;.

In Fon, the sacred palm nuts are called &quot;fádékwín&quot;.
A &quot;divining chain&quot; is referred to in Yoruba as a &quot;òpèlè&quot; and in Fon as an &quot;akplɛ&quot;. It may comprise eight halves of a nut, tied together. The way in which it falls then reveals one of 256 possible signs. 

To perform the divination, the &quot;babalawo&quot; will often be seated on a mat. Before casting the divining chain the diviner may sing to call forth Fá.
In Fon, the divining tray is called a &quot;fátɛ&quot;. In West Africa, the quality of the &quot;fátɛ&quot; may indicate the &quot;babalawo&#x27;s&quot; financial success; some who have a small client base may use only a plastic or cardboard tray, while those with access to greater funds may pay for an elaborate, purpose built wooden &quot;fátɛ&quot;.

Another ritual object is known to the Yoruba as &quot;Ǫpá Ǫșun&quot; and to the Fon as a &quot;fásɛn&quot;. This consists of a metal staff, four to five feet tall, that is capped at the top with a metal disk and sometimes a metal rooster. When a &quot;fásɛn&quot; is created, it is washed in specific leaves and the blood of 16 giant snails; this task is performed by women, secluded from the view of men. Any chickens sacrificed to the &quot;fásɛn&quot; are only eaten by women.

There are sixteen major books in the Odu Ifá literary corpus. When combined, there are a total of 256 Odu (a collection of sixteen, each of which has sixteen alternatives ⇔ 162, or 44) that are believed to reference all situations, circumstances, actions and consequences in life based on the uncountable &quot;ese&quot; (or &quot;poetic tutorials&quot;) relative to the 256 Odu coding. These form the basis of traditional Yoruba spiritual knowledge and are the foundation of all Yoruba divination systems. Ifá proverbs, stories, and poetry are not written down. Rather, they are passed down orally from one &quot;babalawo&quot; to another. Yoruba people consult Ifá for divine intervention and spiritual guidance.

===The Messenger sign of Ifá===

In addition to the sixteen fundamental signs, Ifá divination includes a major sign, which is the combination of Ọse and Otura, from right to left (Ọse-Tura).

That sign must be written each time a ritual is performed: Ọse-Tura is the messenger and the carrier of the sacrifice. It is closely associated with the god Èṣù in the system of Ifá. That Messenger sign was known in Arab and Latin medieval geomancy as the Morning Star.

==&quot;Babalawos&quot;==

An initiate of Ifá is called a &quot;babaláwo&quot; in Yoruba and a &quot;bokɔnɔ&quot; in Fon.

Traditionally only heterosexual men are allowed to become &quot;babalawos&quot;, with women and homosexual males being excluded. Some gay men have nevertheless been initiated; in both Cuba and the United States, for example, several &quot;babalawos&quot; have initiated their openly gay sons. Moreover, despite the traditional prohibition on women taking on this role, the scholar of religion Mary Ann Clark noted that by the early 21st century, female practitioners were &quot;becoming institutionalized in some religious communities&quot; in the United States, where they were known as either &quot;iyalawo&quot; (mother of secrets) or &quot;iyanifá&quot; (mother of Ifá). Female practitioners have also been reported in Mexico.

The restriction on female initiation is explained through the story that the òrìṣà Orula was furious that Yemayá, his wife, had used his &quot;tabla&quot; divining board and subsequently decided to ban women from ever touching it again. Among the Fon, one tradition maintains that women do not need to be initiated into the traditions of the female spirit Gbădu—who is Fá&#x27;s wife—because they already have the power of creation within them. According to Fon diviners, keeping women and Gbădu apart ensures a conceptual state of coolness. This extends to a taboo on women eating any of the meat from animals sacrificed to Gbădu.

Once an individual is initiated as a babalawo they are given a pot containing various items, including palm nuts, which is believed to be the literal embodiment of Orula. Babalawos provide offerings to Orula, including animal sacrifices and gifts of money. In Cuba, Ifá typically involves the casting of consecrated palm nuts to answer a question. The babalawo then interprets the message of the nuts depending on how they have fallen; there are 256 possible configurations in the Ifá system, which the babalawo is expected to have memorised. Individuals approach the babalawo seeking guidance, often on financial matters, at which the diviner will consult Orula through the established divinatory method. In turn, those visiting the babalawos pay them for their services.

===Initiation===

Initiation as a &quot;babalawo&quot; requires a payment to the initiator and is typically regarded as highly expensive. In Benin, Fá initiation usually takes less than a week, whereas initiations into the cults of other &quot;vodún&quot; may take several weeks or months. A distinction is made between an initiation that called &quot;yǐ Fá&quot; (&quot;to receive Fá&quot;), which is often seen as a &quot;first initiation&quot; into Fá&#x27;s veneration, which offers his protection, and the priestly initiation, at which a person is said to &quot;Fázùnyí&quot; (&quot;receive Fá&#x27;s forest&quot;).

Among the Fon, the sacred forest of Fá is called &quot;fázùn&quot;; this is differentiated from ordinary forest by shredded palm fronds, known in Fon as &quot;asàn&quot; and in Yoruba as &quot;màrìwò&quot;. It will be here that new initiates are led; they will be accompanied with animals for sacrifice, by existing initiates singing praise songs, and by a person leading the way carrying a &quot;fásɛn&quot;. A figurine of the spirit Lɛgbá may be brought along for the ritual, invoking this deity to guard the initiates&#x27; passage into the forest. Offerings will be given to him, and divination employed to check that he accepts them.

In the forest, the new initiate will be given a kola nut to eat, to bring him in communion with Fá. All present may then place their hands together on the &quot;fásɛn&quot;, to which a rooster may then be sacrificed. The newcomer&#x27;s eyes will be washed in a herbal mixture called Gbădùsin. The neophyte will then be blindfolded and then into the sacred grove of the &quot;fázùn&quot;, where the secret teachings of Fá are revealed to them. Divination will be used to determine under which of the 256 signs their priesthood will be born. The selected sign indicates which spirits they should pay particular attention to and which taboos they must observe: this may involve avoiding certain foods, the wearing of certain colours, or engaging in specific actions. The initiate&#x27;s head will then be shaved as a symbol of their initiation and they will be ritually bathed and wrapped in white cloth. A celebration follows, in which a goat may be sacrificed to Fá and the participants eat its meat.

The initiate may receive a small bundle, the &quot;kpɔli&quot;, containing secret ingredients corresponding to their personal &quot;du&quot;. They may also receive a small vessel to house their palm nuts and a small stone, the &quot;ken&quot;, to protect them from witchcraft.

==History==
===West African origins===
The 16-principle system has its earliest history in West Africa. Each Niger–Congo-speaking ethnic group that practices it has its own myths of origin; Yoruba religion suggests that it was founded by Orunmila in Ilé-Ifẹ̀ when he initiated himself and then he initiated his students, &quot;Akoda&quot; and &quot;Aseda&quot;. According to the book &quot;The History of the Yorubas from the Earliest of Times to the British Protectorate&quot; (1921) by Nigerian historian Samuel Johnson and Obadiah Johnson, it was Arugba, the mother of Onibogi, the 8th Alaafin of Oyo, who introduced Oyo to Ifá in the late 1400s. She initiated the Alado of Ato and conferred on him the right to initiate others. The Alado, in turn, initiated the priests of Oyo and that was how Ifá came to be in the Oyo empire. 

Ifá originated among the Yoruba peoples.
The linguist Wande Abimbola argued that Ifá probably derived from a simpler divinatory system, &quot;diloggun&quot;; this contrasts with the belief of some &quot;babalawos&quot; that &quot;diloggun&quot; was based on Ifá.

Between &quot;circa&quot; 1727 and 1823, the kingdom of Dahomey was a vassal state of the Yoruba-dominated Oyo Empire to the east, thus resulting in much religious interchange. In this period, the Fon people of Dahomey adopted Ifá as well as the Oró and Egungun cults from the Yoruba. Ifá was present in Dahomey by the reign of its fifth ruler, Tegbesú, who ruled from c.1732 to 1774, and was well established at the royal palace by the reign of Gezò, which lasted from 1818 to 1858.

According to William Bascom, &quot;an indication of the importance of Ifá to the [Yoruba] religious system as a whole is the fact that the most striking religious syncretisms resulting from European contact are to be found in a church established in Lagos in 1934, the Ijọ Ọ̀rúnmila Adulawọ, which was founded on the premise that the teachings of Ifa constitute the Yoruba Bible.&quot; It was also set up in Porto-Novo (Benin) the same year.
According to Erwan Dianteill, the Church of Ifá is still active in 2024, in Nigeria and Benin, with around 2000 followers in Lagos, Porto-Novo and Cotonou.

Of the foreigners coming to West Africa for initiation into Vodún, the largest group sought initiation into Fá.

===Ifá in Cuba===

In Cuba, Ifá came to be used in the Afro-Cuban religion of Santería. There, it is the most complex and prestigious divinatory system used in the religion. The two are closely linked, sharing the same mythology and conception of the universe, with Orula or Ọ̀rúnmila having a prominent place within Santería. In Cuba, Ifá nevertheless also retains a separate existence from Santería.
Many Cuban &quot;babalawos&quot; are also &quot;santeros&quot;, or male initiates of Santería, although it is not uncommon for &quot;babalawos&quot; to perceive themselves as being superior to &quot;santeros&quot;. Although the presence of &quot;babalawos&quot; is not required for Santería ceremonies, they often attend in their capacity as diviners. Other Cuban &quot;babalawos&quot; have been initiates of the Abakuá society. 

At the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, there were an estimated 200 &quot;babalawos&quot; active on Cuba; by the 1990s, Cuban &quot;babalawos&quot; were claiming that they numbered tens of thousands on the island. In the 1980s, Cuban &quot;babalawos&quot; created the organisation Ifá Yesterday, Ifá Today, Ifá Tomorrow, the first Cuban institution to represent the priesthood of an Afro-Cuban religion. Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in the 1990s, Cuba&#x27;s government declared that the island was entering a &quot;Special Period&quot; in which new economic measures would be necessary. As part of this, it selectively supported Afro-Cuban and Santería traditions, partly out of a desire to boost tourism; priests of Santería, Ifá, and Palo all took part in government-sponsored tours for foreigners desiring initiation into such traditions.

===Ifá in the United States===

Cuban migrants took Ifá to the United States. There, during the 1960s, a small group of &quot;babalawos&quot; dominated the Santería scene in New York. Their dominance was challenged by new Cuban migrants who arrived between 1965 and 1973 and who, although initiated &quot;santeros&quot; and &quot;santeras&quot;, were not &quot;babalawos&quot;. The ethnomusicologist María Teresa Vélez noted that &quot;two types of ocha house arose: those that still relied on the babalaos and did not question any of their prerogatives, and those that became independent of the babalaos for most of their ritual activities,&quot; with these latter houses often being run by women.

In 1978, Ifá ceremonies took place in Miami, Florida, overseen by the Nigerian &quot;babalawo&quot; Ifayẹmi Elébùìbọn Awise of Osogbo. He was assisted in this by two Cuban &quot;babalawos&quot;, Luis Fernández-Pelón and José-Miguel Gómez, both of whom were Abakuá members.
In the 1980s, the Chicago-based Philip and Vassa Newmarket established their Ifa Foundation of North and Latin America. Departing from established tradition, they offered &quot;bloodless&quot; initiations that welcomed those who were unwilling to engage in animal sacrifice. Claims have been made that the first woman initiated into Ifá was the Jewish American Dr. D&#x27;Haifa Odufora Ifatogun Ina Arara Agbaye.

===Ifá in Brazil===

Although surviving in Cuban Santería, Ifá did not remain part of a Brazilian religion that owed much to Yoruba traditions, Candomblé. In Candomblé, &quot;dilogun&quot; instead forms the primary method of divination employed by its initiates. One of the earliest practitioners of Ifá in Brazil was the French ethnographer Pierre Verger, who had become a &quot;babalawo&quot; in West Africa and who was also involved in Candomblé.

As a result of growing links between Brazil and Nigeria, in the 1970s various educational efforts to promote understandings of Yoruba culture were established in Brazilian cities. This included the Yoruba Culture Research and Study Centre, founded in 1977 by Fernandes Portugal, and which brought in Nigerian teachers to run a course teaching Ifá. The closing ceremony took place in January 1978, attended by 14 students who were granted the status of &quot;omo&quot; (son of) Ifá. One of these pupils, a Candomblé initiate named José Nilton Vianna Reis (Torodê de Ogun), later went on to become a &quot;babalawo&quot; nine years later, before setting out his own Ifá teaching course in 1984.

==Reception==
In 2008, UNESCO added Ifá to its list of the &quot;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot;.

<doc id="535190" wikidata="Q339608" url="?curid=535190" title="Newton Aycliffe">
<text>Newton Aycliffe is a town in County Durham, England. Founded in 1947 under the New Towns Act of 1946, the town is to the north of Darlington and to the south of Durham. It is the oldest new town in the north of England. Together with the bordering Aycliffe Village (to the south) and the north part of School Aycliffe (to the west), it forms the civil parish of Great Aycliffe. The population of the town at the time of the 2021 census was 26,415.

==History==
===Anglo-Saxons===
Prior to the Newtown development, Aycliffe (originally &#x27;Acley&#x27;) was the site of an Anglo-Saxon settlement. The name Acley came from the Old English words: &#x27;Ac&#x27;, meaning oak, and &#x27;ley&#x27;, meaning &#x27;a clearing&#x27;. Aycliffe was the location of a church synods in AD 782 and AD 789. Another old name was &#x27;Yacley&#x27;. The town&#x27;s motto is Latin for &quot;Not the Least, but the Greatest we seek&quot;.

===Transport===
On the edge of the town is the Bishop Auckland to Darlington railway branch line which is part of the 1825 Stockton and Darlington Railway. George Stephenson&#x27;s steam locomotive Locomotion No 1 was placed on the rails close to Newton Aycliffe near to where Heighington station is.

The Great North Road (A1) passed through the town until 1969.

===World War II===
During World War II, Aycliffe was the site of ammunitions manufacturing. Huge grass-covered munitions factories were built and served by the nearby railway lines. The factories were largely staffed by thousands of women, 
dubbed the &quot;Aycliffe Angels&quot;, who bravely took up the dangerous work.

===Beveridge Report===

The government asked William Beveridge to produce a report on what he wanted Britain to be like after the war. In 1942 he produced his report. Five giants, he said, oppressed mankind – Poverty, Disease, Homelessness, Ignorance and Unemployment. To end this once and for all, Beveridge proposed a state system of Social Security benefits, a National Health Service, council housing, free education and full employment. He called it the Welfare State. The Welfare State was introduced across Britain in 1948. Beveridge selected an area of moorland which lay between Aycliffe and Middridge to be developed into what would become his flagship “new-town”. Newton Aycliffe was intended to be the very embodiment of his vision for postwar Britain. Beveridge, committed as he was to his vision for the emerging social landscape of postwar Britain, also took up residence in the Pease Way area of his flagship new town.

===Industry===

The factories were eventually replaced by manufacturing buildings which over time became the industrial district of the town. After the war, many companies moved onto the industrial estate, including Great Lakes Chemicals, which retained the munitions factories until 2004 when it was closed and demolished, along with numerous factories. There were also Eaton Axles, and B.I.P., who were to become two of the largest employers of the town until the early 1980s. One other company was Union Carbide. Eaton Axles closed down and shipped itself to Poland; B.I.P. is now Hydro Polymers; meanwhile, Union Carbide was taken over by STC (Standard Telephone and Cables) before being taken over by Sanyo for several years, but this has now closed. Businesses currently located in the town include Flymo, 3M, Ebac and Ineos (who have taken over Hydro Polymers) with many more small factory units. One of the largest factories in the district is Gestamp Tallent (Formerly Thyssenkrupp), which now holds 7 plants around the industrial estate. In 2015, Hitachi commenced production at their £82 million railway rolling stock factory at Newton Aycliffe, called Hitachi Newton Aycliffe. It employs 720 people.

==Governance==
Great Aycliffe was once part of a wider ancient parish of Aycliffe which included Brafferton, Newton-Ketton and Preston-le-Skerne.

From 1974 until 2009, Great Aycliffe was in the borough of Sedgefield, based in Spennymoor, and it was the largest town in the borough. Since April 2009, Newton Aycliffe has been governed by the Great Aycliffe Town Council and the County Durham Unitary Authority.

==Geography==
At the 2001 census, Great Aycliffe had a population of 26,385, although in 2007 Great Aycliffe Town Council reported this had risen to 29,000. It is the largest town within the Sedgefield constituency. Within a radius of are several towns and villages including Darlington, Bishop Auckland, Shildon and Heighington. To the south of the town is the village of Aycliffe. Newton comes from &#x27;New Town&#x27;.

Aycliffe Village is near to the A1(M) junction with the A167 (former A1).

===Woodham===

The original Woodham was a medieval village, although apart from a few low mound earthworks (on private land) there is no trace of this original village. It was located on the northern side of the Woodham Burn stream and to the East of the A167 that cuts through the site in a north–south direction. The village itself was said to have been &#x27;burned by the Scots&#x27; during the English – Scottish wars of the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and appears not to have been rebuilt, although several buildings did appear in the 18th and 19th centuries, some of which still remain on both east and west sides of the A167. 
There appears to have been a small 18th-century stone quarry on the eastern side of this site with associated buildings, which can be seen on the original 1860 Ordnance Survey maps, however most of these buildings were demolished towards the end of the 19th century.

Afterwards the hamlet of Woodham remained relatively unchanged until the late 1970s – early 1980s, when some of its farms, such as Woodham North, Woodham South and the original Woodham Farm itself, were all demolished and their land used for new housing developments, as nearby Newton Aycliffe expanded and began to encroach on the original Woodham area.

Newton Aycliffe, in common with many of the post war &quot;New Towns&quot; consisted originally of mostly social / public housing, a large proportion of which is now privately owned. Woodham is the largest of a number of private housing developments that have taken place since the late 1970s, to the North of Woodham Burn; which at one time formed a natural northern boundary to the town of Newton Aycliffe.

From its start Newton Aycliffe kept expanding in size, until 1980 when the council stopped building council homes. Since then private houses and housing associations have been building the town&#x27;s homes. In the early 1980s an area of private housing called Woodham Village was built on the site of what was once Woodham Farm, it was designed and developed around a community centre, church and a parade of shops overlooking a central green. The Huntsman Public house is also situated on the same central green, whilst the Woodham Golf and Country Club lies a short way to the north of the main development, on the road to Rushyford.

Woodham Way is the centre of Woodham containing a row of shops including dentists, takeaways and newsagents. Woodham lies close to the town centre and the local supermarket, both within walking distance.
Recently the area has been expanded by more housing developments increasing the size of the village by a notable amount.

==Economy==

The town has a large industrial estate to the south of the town, split into three.
* On the Heighington Lane Business Park, Lidl have a main distribution centre on &quot;Millennium Way&quot;, and with RF Micro Devices, are to the south of the estate. The RFMD plant was formerly a DRAM factory for Fujitsu until 1999, when bought by Filtronic, who then sold their semiconductor business to RFMD in 2007. The plant uses pHEMT technologies (High-electron-mobility transistor), using Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and Gallium nitride (GaN). The plant makes electronic wafers.

<text>A real-time clock (RTC) is an electronic device (most often in the form of an integrated circuit) that measures the passage of time.

Although the term often refers to the devices in personal computers, servers and embedded systems, RTCs are present in almost any electronic device which needs to keep accurate time of day.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;real-time clock&quot; is used to avoid confusion with ordinary hardware clocks which are only signals that govern digital electronics, and do not count time in human units. RTC should not be confused with real-time computing, which shares its three-letter acronym but does not directly relate to time of day.

==Purpose==
Although keeping time can be done without an RTC, using one has benefits:
* Reliably maintains and provides current time through disruptive system states such as hangs, sleep, reboots, or if given sufficient backup power, full shutdown and hardware reassembly, without the need to have its time set again.
* Low power consumption (important when running from alternate power)
* Frees the main system for time-critical tasks
* Sometimes more accurate than other methods

A GPS receiver can shorten its startup time by comparing the current time, according to its RTC, with the time at which it last had a valid signal. If it has been less than a few hours, then the previous ephemeris is still usable.

Some motherboards are made without RTCs. The RTC may be omitted out of desire to save money or reduce possible sources of hardware failure.

==Power source==

RTCs often have an alternate source of power, so they can continue to keep time while the primary source of power is off or unavailable. This alternate source of power is normally a lithium battery in older systems, but some newer systems use a supercapacitor, because they are rechargeable and can be soldered. The alternate power source can also supply power to battery backed RAM.

==Timing==
Most RTCs use a crystal oscillator, but some have the option of using the power line frequency. The crystal frequency is usually 32.768 kHz, the same frequency used in quartz clocks and watches. Being exactly 215 cycles per second, it is a convenient rate to use with simple binary counter circuits. The low frequency saves power, while remaining above human hearing range. The quartz tuning fork of these crystals does not change size much from temperature, so temperature does not change its frequency much.

Some RTCs use a micromechanical resonator on the silicon chip of the RTC. This reduces the size and cost of an RTC by reducing its parts count. Micromechanical resonators are much more sensitive to temperature than quartz resonators. So, these compensate for temperature changes using an electronic thermometer and electronic logic.

Typical crystal RTC accuracy specifications are from ±100 to ±20 parts per million (8.6 to 1.7 seconds per day), but temperature-compensated RTC ICs are available accurate to less than 5 parts per million. In practical terms, this is good enough to perform celestial navigation, the classic task of a chronometer. In 2011, chip-scale atomic clocks became available. Although vastly more expensive and power-hungry (120 mW vs. &lt;1 μW), they keep time within 50 parts per trillion ().

==Examples==

Many integrated circuit manufacturers make RTCs, including Epson, Intersil, IDT, Maxim, NXP Semiconductors, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics and Ricoh. A common RTC used in single-board computers is the Maxim Integrated DS1307.

The RTC was introduced to PC compatibles by the IBM PC/AT in 1984, which used a Motorola MC146818 RTC. Later, Dallas Semiconductor made compatible RTCs, which were often used in older personal computers, and are easily found on motherboards because of their distinctive black battery cap and silkscreened logo. A standard CMOS interface is available for the PC RTC.

In newer computer systems, the RTC is integrated into the southbridge chip.

Some microcontrollers have a real-time clock built in, generally only the ones with many other features and peripherals.

===Radio-based RTCs===
Some modern computers receive clock information by digital radio and use it to promote time-standards. There are two common methods: Most cell phone protocols (e.g. LTE) directly provide the current local time. If an internet radio is available, a computer may use the network time protocol. Computers used as local time servers occasionally use GPS or ultra-low frequency radio transmissions broadcast by a national standards organization (i.e. a radio clock).

===Software-based RTCs===
The following system is well-known to embedded systems programmers, who sometimes must construct RTCs in systems that lack them. Most computers have one or more hardware timers that use timing signals from quartz crystals or ceramic resonators. These have inaccurate absolute timing (more than 100 parts per million) that is yet very repeatable (often less than 1 ppm). Software can do the math to make these into accurate RTCs. The hardware timer can produce a periodic interrupt, e.g. 50 Hz, to mimic a historic RTC (see below). However, it uses math to adjust the timing chain for accuracy:

time = time + rate.

When the &quot;time&quot; variable exceeds a constant, usually a power of two, the nominal, calculated clock time (say, for 1/50 of a second) is subtracted from &quot;time&quot;, and the clock&#x27;s timing-chain software is invoked to count fractions of seconds, seconds, etc. With 32-bit variables for time and rate, the mathematical resolution of &quot;rate&quot; can exceed one part per billion. The clock remains accurate because it will occasionally skip a fraction of a second, or increment by two fractions. The tiny skip (&quot;jitter&quot;) is imperceptible for almost all real uses of an RTC.

The complexity with this system is determining the instantaneous corrected value for the variable &quot;rate&quot;. The simplest system tracks RTC time and reference time between two settings of the clock, and divides reference time by RTC time to find &quot;rate&quot;. Internet time is often accurate to less than 20 milliseconds, so 8000 or more seconds (2.2 or more hours) of separation between settings can usually divide the forty milliseconds (or less) of error to less than 5 parts per million to get chronometer-like accuracy. The main complexity with this system is converting dates and times to counts of seconds, but methods are well known.

If the RTC runs when a unit is off, usually the RTC will run at two rates, one when the unit is on and another when off. This is because the temperature and power-supply voltage in each state is consistent. To adjust for these states, the software calculates two rates. First, software records the RTC time, reference time, on seconds and off seconds for the two intervals between the last three times that the clock is set. Using this, it can measure the accuracy of the two intervals, with each interval having a different distribution of on and off seconds. The rate math solves two linear equations to calculate two rates, one for on and the other for off.

Another approach measures the temperature of the oscillator with an electronic thermometer, (e.g. a thermistor and analog-to-digital converter) and uses a polynomial to calculate &quot;rate&quot; about once per minute. These require a calibration that measures the frequency at several temperatures, and then a linear regression to find the equation of temperature. The most common quartz crystals in a system are SC-cut crystals, and their rates over temperature can be characterized with a 3rd-degree polynomial. So, to calibrate these, the frequency is measured at four temperatures. The common tuning-fork-style crystals used in watches and many RTC components have parabolic (2nd-degree) equations of temperature, and can be calibrated with only 3 measurements. MEMS oscillators vary, from 3rd degree to fifth degree polynomials, depending on their mechanical design, and so need from four to six calibration measurements. Something like this approach might be used in commercial RTC ICs, but the actual methods of efficient high-speed manufacturing are proprietary.

===Historic RTCs===
Some computer designs such as smaller IBM System/360s,
PDP-8s and Novas used a real-time clock that was accurate, simple and low cost. In Europe, North America and some other grids, the frequency of the AC mains is adjusted to the long-term frequency accuracy of the national standards. In those grids, clocks using AC mains can keep perfect time without adjustment. Such clocks are not practical in portable computers or grids (e.g. in South Asia) that do not regulate the frequency of AC mains.

These computers&#x27; power supplies use a transformer or resistor divider to produce a sine wave at logic voltages. This signal is conditioned by a zero crossing detector, either using a linear amplifier, or a schmitt trigger. The result is a square wave with single, fast edges at the mains frequency. This logic signal triggers an interrupt. The interrupt handler software usually counts cycles, seconds, etc. In this way, it can provide an entire clock and calendar. In the IBM 360, the interrupt updates a 64-bit count of microseconds utilized by standardized systems software. The clock&#x27;s jitter error is half if the clock interrupts for each zero crossing, instead of each cycle.

The clock also usually formed the basis of computers&#x27; software timing chains; e.g. it was usually the timer used to switch tasks in an operating system. Counting timers used in modern computers provide similar features at lower precision, and may trace their requirements to this type of clock. (e.g. in the PDP-8, the mains-based clock, model DK8EA, came first, and was later followed by a crystal-based clock, DK8EC.)

A software-based clock must be set each time its computer is turned on. Originally this was done by computer operators. When the Internet became commonplace, network time protocols were used to automatically set clocks of this type.

<text>The Opel Zafira is a car manufactured and marketed across three generations between 1999 and 2019 by Opel. Based on the Opel Astra platform, it is developed to occupy the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) segment.

The Zafira was also marketed under the Vauxhall marque in the United Kingdom until June 2018, the Holden marque in Australia until June 2005, and under a number of other market-specific brands and names. 

The name &quot;Zafira&quot; derives from the Arabic word meaning &quot;to succeed&quot;. Since 2011, it received an additional moniker as the Zafira Tourer.


== Zafira A (1999) ==


The first generation Zafira was internally designated as the &quot;Zafira A&quot;. Co-developed with Porsche, it debuted in concept form at the 1997 Frankfurt Auto Show and entered series production in January 1999, with sales beginning in April of that year.

The Zafira shared the T platform with the 1998 Astra G, sharing much commonality with that car. The Zafira seated seven passengers in three rows. Using a system marketed as &quot;Flex 7&quot;, the split back seat could fold into the floor to increase cargo space, without requiring removal.

Offered with a series of petrol engines and initially a single diesel offering, the &quot;X&quot; engines were replaced by the newer &quot;Z&quot; engine generation in 2000. These featured variable intake manifolds and were able to meet Euro 3 emissions standards. The 2.0-litre turbodiesels were complemented by a 2.2-litre option in January 2002.

The Zafira A body was used in GM/Opel&#x27;s concept hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle the GM HydroGen3.

A facelift was launched in February 2003 at the Geneva Motor Show.

The Zafira ranked third in the European Car of the Year for 2000, behind only the Fiat Multipla and Toyota Yaris. In TüV&#x27;s ranking of the quality of three year old cars, the Zafira was by far the best Opel; only slightly behind the winning Ford Focus.

Zafira A production ended on 25 May 2005, in Bochum. It was replaced by Zafira B in Europe, but was still sold in most other markets until 2012 (albeit that its cousin the Chevrolet Astra was discontinued in 2011), except for Australia and New Zealand, where the model was cancelled altogether.

=== Zafira OPC ===
Introduced at Geneva in February 2001, the turbocharged Zafira OPC went on sale in October 2001. With , this was the fastest minivan on sale in Europe. Only available with a five speed manual transmission, 0–100 km/h (62 mph) can be reached in 8.2 seconds and the top speed is .

=== Markets ===
The Zafira was marketed in the Philippines from 2001 to 2005, as the last Europe-based Opel marketed in the Philippines after they stopped selling the Opel Astra in 2003. Although sold as the Chevrolet Zafira, it was sold alongside other Opel vehicles until it the Opel name was pulled out of the Philippine-market by its distributor, GM Philippines.

The Zafira was produced and sold in the Thailand from 2000 to 2005. it was sold alongside other Opel vehicles until it the Opel name was pulled out of the Thai-market by its distributor, GM Thailand. Thailand’s domestic family wagon segment with 3,946 units sold.

The Zafira A was sold in Malaysia as the Chevrolet Nabira.

=== Subaru Traviq ===
The Zafira was sold in Japan from August 2001 through to November 2004 as the Subaru Traviq alongside the standard Opel vehicle. In exchange, Subaru supplied the Subaru Forester as the Chevrolet Forester in India since 2003.

According to Subaru, the Traviq name was a combination of the words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;quick&quot;. Imported from Thailand, the Traviq was originally only available with the bigger 2.2 litre engine, although a 1.8 L, lower priced alternative was added in July 2003. The engines used were not Subaru supplied boxer engines, but were conventional in line units that were uncharacteristic to market recognised Subaru products, and all-wheel drive was also not available.

The sale of the Zafira as a Subaru created a conflict with previously established Yanase Co., Ltd. retail dealerships, in that Yanase was already selling Opel products, like the Zafira. When production of the Traviq ended, Yanase continued to import Opel products into Japan until 2006. It was replaced later in 2008 by the Subaru Exiga – developed from the Subaru Legacy platform. 


== Zafira B (2005) ==
The second generation Zafira, internally designated &quot;Zafira B&quot;, debuted in Europe on 12 February 2005, with sales starting on 9 June 2005. It shared the platform and mechanical parts with the Opel Astra H. In February 2007, the Zafira B was launched in Singapore. By March 2007, the model had only been introduced in Europe and Singapore.

It went on sale in Mexico in April 2006, and Chile in September 2007. In both countries, it was branded as the &quot;Chevrolet Zafira&quot;. Although this generation was replaced in the end of 2011 by the Zafira C, this model remained in production until May 2014 as the Zafira &quot;Family&quot;. This name change occurred in markets including Germany.

=== Names and markets ===
* Vauxhall Zafira – United Kingdom
* Chevrolet Zafira – Chile and Mexico
* Opel Zafira – Europe (except for United Kingdom), Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan &amp; South Africa

In Mexico the Chevrolet Zafira was discontinued after the 2006 model year, and replaced by the five-passenger Chevrolet HHR.

=== Engines ===
The Zafira B&#x27;s engine line was partly carried over from the previous Astra/Zafira generation. Opel replaced the 2.0 and 2.2 turbodiesel I4 engines with 1.9 L common rail turbodiesels developed by Fiat (Multijet). Opel Performance Center developed a turbocharged 2.0 L performance version of the Zafira B as well. A CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) version of the new Zafira with a 1.6 L engine is also available.

=== Fire issues and recalls ===

In November 2015, the London Fire Brigade issued an alert in response to a &quot;spike&quot; in reports of fires with the model.

In December 2015, safety officials in the United Kingdom asked Vauxhall to initiate a full safety recall of the model Zafira B, due to a worrying level of car fires apparently or alleged to have been caused by &#x27;Improper Repairs&#x27;.

The fires continued, even those recalled, and a second full safety recall was announced in May 2016, with all owners advised not to use the fan in speeds regulated by the &quot;resistor pack&quot; which contained a solder based unreliable safety critical thermal fuse, until the second recall, starting August 2016, had been carried out.

On 3 May 2018, a criminal investigation into Vauxhall&#x27;s handling of the fires of the Zafira B and recalls was launched in the United Kingdom.

On 31 August 2019, major damage occurred in a parking garage in Cork, Ireland when an Opel Zafira caught fire.

On 7 January 2020, there was a spontaneous fire in an Opel Zafira, which caused over 200 to 300 cars in a parking garage at Stavanger Airport, Sola to be destroyed. No people were harmed.

== Zafira C/Zafira Tourer (2011) ==
The third generation of the Zafira, called the Zafira Tourer, was previewed in concept form at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, as the &#x27;Zafira Tourer Concept&#x27;.

It was largely based on the Opel Astra J, and when the Zafira Tourer C went on sale, the Zafira B remained on sale from 2011 up to 2014, albeit in facelifted form as the &quot;Zafira Family&quot;, to act as a smaller and cheaper version, as the Zafira Tourer C increased in size, to act as a proper rival to the Ford S-Max.

A hybrid/electric version was expected to follow during 2012. This car indirectly replaced the Opel Sintra, the only previous full sized Vauxhall/Opel MPV in Europe, which was discontinued in May 1999 after just three years on sale, as a slow selling product built in the United States. The production version debuted at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show in September, and went on sale November 2011.

A natural gas version of the Zafira Tourer was announced in December 2011. A dual fuel vehicle, its CNG tank driving the car 530 kilometres, and a 14-litre petrol tank provided additional range or operation when a CNG filling station was not available.

In June 2016, a facelift was unveiled for 2017 (with sales starting at the end of 2016), dropping &#x27;Tourer&#x27; from the name when sold as an Opel. As part of the upgrade, new front and rear bumpers and new interior brought styling in line with the Opel Astra K. OnStar navigation was also introduced as part of an updated IntelliLink infotainment system, complete with 4G LTE hotspot, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.

Other new options for MY2017 included adaptive LED headlights, &quot;Opel Eye&quot; front camera, high beam assist, traffic sign assist, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control.

In June 2018, the Vauxhall Zafira Tourer was discontinued from the United Kingdom, citing the rise of SUV and crossover vehicles.

In 2019, it was replaced by LCV-based Zafira Life.

=== Engines ===
All engines had a six speed manual gearbox as standard, bar the 1.8 petrol, which had a five speed manual gearbox as standard. An automatic gearbox was available as an option on the 1.4T and 2.0 CDTI (165 PS), both without S/S.

An EcoFLEX version went on sale in 2012, equipped with the 2.0 CDTI (130PS) engine and it gained a Start/Stop system to make it more economical, emitting 119g/km of , as for petrol variants they were 1.4T ecoFLEX with a Start/Stop system with same amount of power (120 and 140 PS) like standard versions but with lower emissions – 144g/km and better fuel efficiency.

In 2013, two all new engines were introduced: 1.6 SIDI Turbo petrol engine with 170 PS and 200 PS, and newly developed 1.6 CDTI diesel engine with 136 PS. In September 2014, Opel introduced its all new generation of engines – Large Diesel engines, starting with 2.0 CDTI engine with 170 PS and 400 Nm, which is a part of new strategy in which Opel will introduce seventeen new engines, in a period from 2014–2018.

<text>Slough Creek is a tributary of the Lamar River, approximately 25 mi (40 km) long, in Montana and Wyoming in the United States.

==History==
Slough Creek got its name when an 1867 party of gold prospectors ventured into the valley and described its condition as a &quot;slough.&quot; The name began appearing on maps as early as 1872. A myth associated with the name involves a U.S. Army enlisted man who was escorting an exploring party in 1873 and got lost in the valley. Trumpeter John P. Slough of Company I, Second Cavalry wrote this in his diary:
Although many have attempted to attribute the name to Trumpeter Slough based on his diary, the name was given in 1867.

==Location==
It rises in southern Montana, in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in the Beartooth Mountains, and flows southwest, into Yellowstone National Park and into Wyoming. It discharges to the Lamar River near Tower junction within Yellowstone National Park. In turn the Lamar River forms a confluence with the Yellowstone River inside of Yellowstone National Park. Slough Creek is a mildly alkali watercourse. The Slough Creek watershed consists of mixed fir forest, sage flats and grassland. These plant communities support considerable faunal diversity, including coyote and bison.

==Angling==
Slough Creek is one of the most popular fishing areas in Yellowstone Park. The access is relatively easy and the cutthroat fishing is some of the best in the world. The lower meadows of Slough Creek, below the campground, are easily accessible from parking areas between the campground and the Cooke City road. There are rainbow trout in this lower water as well as Yellowstone cutthroat trout and cutthroat/rainbow hybrids. The upper meadows of Slough are accessed from a trailhead near the campground. The first meadow is a 45-minute walk from the trailhead. The first meadow is the most popular since it is nearby and the fishing is excellent. Slough Creek&#x27;s second meadow is about a three-hour hike. Cutthroat trout in Slough offer good dry fly fishing with heavy hatches of caddis, pale morning duns, and large Green Drakes in July. Terrestrials are prominent in late summer.
In the summer of 2007 an angler reported the first rainbow trout to be caught upstream of the Slough Creek falls. The introduction of rainbow trout may affect both the native cutthroat trout as well as other wildlife species who count on the cutthroat as a food source. Slough Creek is not usually fishable until about the second week of July, because of high water, so check conditions by contacting local fly stores The National Park Service has made frequent changes to the regulations for Slough Creek, and in 2018 has made significant new changes. Anglers are now required to kill all non-native fish, including rainbow trout, brook trout, and identifiable rainbow/cutthroat hybrids throughout the Lamar drainage, including all of Slough Creek. On page 14 of the 2018 regulations they still say that if it has a red slash put it back, but that is clearly superseded by the region specific requirement that if a fish landed in the Lamar drainage is clearly identifiable as a hybrid then it must be killed, even if it has a red slash, with the caveat that &quot;if you don&#x27;t know, let it go.&quot; Another significant change to the Park-wide fishing regulations is that felt soles are no longer permitted on waders. Other Park-wide regulations, that continue from previous years, are that barbed hooks, lead weights, lead split shot, and live bait are banned.

== Wolves ==

In 2003, a wolf pack formed in Yellowstone National Park along the creek and it was named the Slough Creek Pack. Founding members came from the Druid Peak and the Mollie&#x27;s Pack.

<doc id="535204" wikidata="Q1235872" url="?curid=535204" title="Northam, Devon">
<text>Northam ( ) is a market town, civil parish and electoral ward in Devon, England, lying north of Bideford. The civil parish also includes the villages of Westward Ho!, Appledore, West Appledore, Diddywell, Buckleigh and Silford, and the residential areas of Orchard Hill and Raleigh Estate.

==History==
Northam is thought to have been the site of an Anglo-Saxon earthwork fortification, and an area between Northam and Appledore is conjectured to have been where the Danish Viking Ubba (or Hubba) was repelled during the reign of Alfred the Great. This is commemorated in local place names like Bloody Corner and Hubba&#x27;s Rock (or Hubbleston), which is supposed to be the site where Ubba was killed. It was also the site of the Battle of Northam in 1069 where the sons of Harold Godwinson were defeated. St Margaret&#x27;s church is the Anglican parish church for the town and has been a Grade I listed building since 1951.

In 1832 a meeting was held in Northam to protest an attempt by Augustus Saltren-Willett, lord of the manor, to take ownership of the commons of Northam Burrows.

Royal North Devon Golf Club was formed at Northam Burrows in 1864; its course is the oldest on its original site in England.

Between 1901 and 1917, the town and golf course were served by Northam railway station.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Northam, at parish (town), district and county level: Northam Town Council, Torridge District Council (based in nearby Bideford) and Devon County Council (based in Exeter). The town council is based at the Town Hall at 1 Windmill Lane.
Northam was an ancient parish. Until 1867 the parish was governed by its vestry in the same way as most rural areas. In 1867 a local board was established for the parish. Local boards were converted into urban district councils in 1894. Northam Urban District Council built itself a headquarters on Windmill Lane in 1934, initially called the Council Offices.

Northam Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the new district of Torridge. A successor parish was created covering the former urban district, with its council taking the name Northam Town Council. The town council continues to be based at the 1934 building on Windmill Lane, but has renamed it Town Hall.

==Northam Burrows==
A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Northam Burrows is a saltmarsh and dune landscape, adjacent to the Torridge Estuary.

It is part of the North Devon Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and sits within North Devon&#x27;s Biosphere Reserve.

It is also home to the oldest golf course in England, the Royal North Devon Golf Club.

==Sport and recreation==
Northam has a King George&#x27;s Field as a memorial to King George V.

Torridge Leisure Centre, off Churchill Way, has lane and learner pools. It also has a gym and sauna.

==Facilities==
Northam has a public library. This burned down in 2005 destroying the building and 90% of the books, in a fire believed to have been caused by the action of a hands-free magnifier on a pile of leaflets. The public library was threatened with closure in 2014 due to cuts in the County&#x27;s budget.

==Railway==
The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway (B,WH&amp;A,R) was most unusual amongst British railways in that although it was built as a standard gauge line it was not joined to the rest of the railway network, despite the London and South Western Railway having a station at Bideford, East-the-Water, meaning on the other side of the River Torridge from the main town.

The line was wholly situated on the peninsula made up of Westward Ho!, Northam and Appledore with extensive sand dunes the Torridge and Taw estuary. Northam station and the line closed in 1917 having been requisitioned by the War Office, and is now used as part of the Tarka Trail cycle route which forms part of the South West Coast Path.

==Bus services==
*Stagecoach 21= Ilfracombe to Westward Ho!
*Stagecoach 21A= Ilfracombe to Appledore
*Stagecoach 16 = Bideford - Westward Ho! - Appledore

Westward Ho! Buses serve The Square, Sandymere Rd and Atlantic Way.
Appledore Buses serve Lenards Rd and Churchill Way.

The 16 Bus service serves Morwenna Park Road, Sea View Road, Windsor Road and JH Taylor Drive

==Notable residents==
* Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats, of Port Hill and Durrant House
* Clarence Raybould, conductor, pianist and composer, buried with his wife in St Margaret&#x27;s Church.
*Rosemary West - serial killer

<text>Milton William &quot;Bill&quot; Cooper (May 6, 1943 – November 5, 2001) was an American conspiracy theorist, radio broadcaster, and author known for his 1991 book &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;, in which he warned of multiple global conspiracies, some involving extraterrestrial life. Cooper also described HIV/AIDS as a man-made disease used to target blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals, and that a cure was made before it was implemented. He has been described as a &quot;militia theoretician&quot;. Cooper was killed in 2001 by sheriff&#x27;s deputies after he shot at them during an attempted arrest.

==Early life and education==
Little is known about Cooper&#x27;s background and education, beyond the information supplied in his own accounts. He claimed to have served in the United States Navy, the United States Air Force, and Naval Intelligence until his discharge in 1975; however, public records only indicate a period of service in the Navy with a ratings code of E-5/Sergeant (Petty officer second class in the Navy), including a tour of duty in Vietnam with two service medals. At the end of the war, while working in naval intelligence, Cooper served on a briefing team for Admiral Bernard A. Clarey. He then attended a junior college in California, and worked for several technical and vocational schools before making his conspiracy theories known, beginning in 1988. Cooper expanded the speculations of earlier conspiracists by incorporating government involvement with extraterrestrials as a central theme.

==&quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;==
In 1991, Cooper wrote and published &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;. The book has been influential among &quot;UFO and militia circles&quot;. Just prior to the trial of Terry Nichols in 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;the manifesto of the militia movement&quot;.

According to sociologist Paul Gilroy, Cooper claimed &quot;an elaborate conspiracy theory that encompasses the Kennedy assassination, the doings of the secret world government, the coming ice age, and a variety of other covert activities associated with the Illuminati&#x27;s declaration of war upon the people of America&quot;. Political scientist Michael Barkun characterized it as &quot;among the most complex superconspiracy theories&quot;, and also among the most influential due to its popularity in militia circles as well as mainstream bookstores. Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke described the book as a &quot;chaotic farrago of conspiracy myths interspersed with reprints of executive laws, official papers, reports and other extraneous materials designed to show the looming prospect of a world government imposed on the American people against their wishes and in flagrant contempt of the Constitution.&quot;

== UFOs, aliens and the Illuminati ==

Cooper gained attention in Ufology circles in 1988 when he claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings with extraterrestrials, a topic on which he expounded in &quot;Behold a Pale Horse.&quot; By one account he served as a &quot;low level clerk&quot; in the Navy, and as such would not have had the security clearance needed to access classified documents. In the Summer of 1988, Cooper made his first public comments on the ParaNet Bulletin Board System, an early UFO message board, claiming that in 1966 he was serving aboard the &quot;USS Tiru&quot; when he and fellow Navy personnel witnessed a metal craft &quot;larger than a football field&quot; repeatedly enter and exit the water. 
Cooper claimed he was instructed by superiors to never speak about the incident. Biographer Mark Jacobson argues &quot;the Tiru incident itself would not have done much to make Cooper&#x27;s name in ufology. That opportunity came only a few days later&quot; when he was contacted by fellow ParaNet poster John Lear. Lear, the son of Learjet founder Bill Lear, identified as a pilot who had flown missions for the CIA. Lear was the author of a post titled &quot;The UFO Coverup&quot; which incorporated elements of mythos from Paul Bennewitz, a ufologist who was later revealed to have been fed disinformation by American counter-intelligence agent Richard C. Doty. Cooper soon visited Lear, and the two spent much time together from 1988 to 1990.

Cooper&#x27;s views were heavily influenced by Lear and his story of alien collusion with secret governmental forces. In 1989, the two released an &quot;indictment&quot; against the US Government for &quot;aiding and abetting and concealing this Alien Nation which exists in our borders&quot;. In 2018, columnist Colin Dickey noted the pair&#x27;s influence, writing &quot;in the early years [UFO writers] did not, by and large, embrace strong political positions. They were the tip of a spear asserting that the number one thing we had to fear was not little green men, but the government that colluded with them, appropriating their technology against us.&quot; Cooper and Lear&#x27;s collaboration lasted for a few years, after which Cooper accused Lear of being a CIA plant.

Ufologists later asserted that some of the material Cooper claimed to have seen in Naval Intelligence documents was actually plagiarized by Cooper from their own research, including several items that the ufologists had fabricated as pranks. Don Ecker of &quot;UFO Magazine&quot; ran a series of exposés on Cooper in 1990.

Cooper linked the Illuminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the United States government, but later retracted these claims. He accused President Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, which supposedly allowed the aliens to abduct humans in exchange for technological assistance. Cooper then claimed that Eisenhower had established an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with the aliens and keep their presence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens &quot;manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult&quot;, and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them.

Cooper described the Illuminati as a secret international organization, controlled by the Bilderberg Group, that conspired with the Knights of Columbus, Masons, Skull and Bones, and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was the establishment of a New World Order. According to Cooper, the Illuminati conspirators not only invented alien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrials to take over the world. Cooper believed that James Forrestal&#x27;s fatal fall from a window on the sixteenth floor of Bethesda Hospital was connected to the alleged secret committee Majestic 12, and that JASON advisory group scientists reported to an elite group of Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations executive committee members who were high-ranking members of the Illuminati.

Cooper also claimed that the antisemitic conspiracy theory forgery &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; was actually an Illuminati work, and instructed readers to substitute &quot;Sion&quot; for &quot;Zion&quot;, &quot;Illuminati&quot; for &quot;Jews&quot;, and &quot;cattle&quot; for &quot;Goyim&quot;. The publisher removed the chapter that was a reproduction of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion document from later printings of &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;.

== Kennedy assassination ==
In &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;, Cooper asserts that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated because he was about to reveal that extraterrestrials were in the process of taking over the Earth. According to a &quot;top secret&quot; video of the assassination that Cooper claimed to have discovered, the driver of the presidential limousine, William Greer, used &quot;a gas pressure device developed by aliens from the Trilateral Commission&quot; to shoot the president from the driver&#x27;s seat. The Zapruder film shows Greer twice turning to look into the back seat of the car; Cooper theorized that Greer first turned to assess Kennedy&#x27;s status after the external attack, and then to fire the fatal shot. Conspiracy theories implicating Greer reportedly &quot;snowballed&quot; after publication of &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s video purporting to prove his theory was analyzed by several television stations, according to one source, and was found to be &quot;... a poor-quality fake using chunks of the... Zapruder film.&quot;

== HIV/AIDS ==
In &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; Cooper proposed that AIDS was the result of a conspiracy to decrease the populations of blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals. In 2000 South Africa&#x27;s Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang received criticism for distributing the chapter discussing this theory to senior South African government officials.

== Radio show ==
From 1992 until his death in November 2001, Cooper originated his radio show, &quot;The Hour of the Time&quot; from a studio in his house at the top of a hill in the small White Mountains town of Eagar, Arizona, 15 miles from the New Mexico border. Cooper sent his show via audio cassette, satellite patch, or direct telephone link to WWCR in Nashville where it was broadcast by the station&#x27;s 100,000-watt shortwave transmitter. Mark Potok, spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Cooper was well known within the militia movement for his anti-government shortwave radio program. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was reportedly a fan. McVeigh was reported by &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; to have ordered from Cooper a cassette, &quot;Waco, The Big Lie&quot;, which the radio host marketed. Cooper broadcast conspiracy theories on the Waco siege in early 1993, which he believed had been the opening battle in a new Civil War. He later participated in the early radio shows of Alex Jones, who was an admirer of his broadcasts.

On June 28, 2001, commenting on a televised interview of Osama bin Laden at his hideout in Afghanistan, Cooper claimed that bin Laden would soon be &quot;blamed&quot; for a &#x27;major attack&#x27; on a large U.S. city, &quot;but don&#x27;t you believe it&quot;. Immediately after the attacks on September 11, 2001, he predicted the U.S. would soon be at war in &#x27;two or maybe three countries&#x27;. He began broadcasting the &quot;controlled demolition&quot; conspiracy theory on the day of the attacks, which eventually became a center of 9/11 conspiracy theories.

== Death ==
As Cooper moved away from the Ufology community and toward the militia and anti-government subculture in the late 1990s, he became convinced that he was being personally targeted by President Bill Clinton and the Internal Revenue Service. In July 1998, he was charged with tax evasion; an arrest warrant was issued, but Cooper eluded repeated attempts to serve it. In 2000, he was named a &quot;major fugitive&quot; by the United States Marshals Service.

On November 5, 2001, Apache County sheriff&#x27;s deputies attempted to arrest Cooper at his Eagar, Arizona home on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and endangerment stemming from disputes with local residents. After an exchange of gunfire during which Cooper shot one of the deputies in the head, Cooper was fatally shot. Federal authorities reported that Cooper had spent years evading execution of the 1998 arrest warrant, and according to a spokesman for the Marshals Service, he vowed that &quot;he would not be taken alive&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Cooper&#x27;s writing holds enduring popularity in hip hop, being referenced by artists including Public Enemy, Tupac Shakur, and Jay-Z.
* The rapper William Cooper took his stage name from Milton William Cooper.
* &quot;The X-Files&quot; incorporated numerous elements of Cooper&#x27;s mythos of a secret government in collusion with alien beings. In one of the most famous episodes, &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, John F. Kennedy is assassinated to prevent him from revealing the existence of aliens. The 1998 &quot;X-Files&quot; film uses phrasing from Cooper (e.g. &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars&quot;) and features the name Cooper in apparent homage.
* In 1997, hip hop group Killarmy released their debut album, &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars&quot;, a title drawn from Cooper&#x27;s work.

<doc id="535210" wikidata="Q478147" url="?curid=535210" title="Northam, Western Australia">
<text>Northam is a town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, situated at the confluence of the Avon and Mortlock Rivers. It is the largest town and regional centre in the Avon Valley region of the Central Wheatbelt. It is located approximately 97 kilometres (60 miles) north east of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia. At the time of the 2021 census, Northam had a population of 6,679.

== History ==
The area around Northam was first explored in 1830 by a party of colonists led by Ensign Robert Dale, and subsequently founded in 1833. It was named by Governor Stirling, probably after a village of the same name in Devon, England. Almost immediately it became a point of departure for explorers and settlers who were interested in the lands which lay to the east.

This initial importance declined with the growing importance of the nearby towns of York and Beverley, but the arrival of the railway made Northam the major departure point for prospectors and miners heading east towards the goldfields.

The town has had three newspapers over the years, all now defunct, namely The Northam Advertiser, Northam Courier, and the Northam News.

A number of older buildings have heritage significance and still serve the community.

== Camps and centres ==

=== Northam Migrant Accommodation Centre ===
During the 1940s and 1950s in Northam there were extensive camps for displaced persons and immigrants from continental Europe.

The Northam Migrant Accommodation Centre closed in September 1951. It had been the first place of residence in Western Australia for approximately 15,000 immigrants from the Baltic states, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Belarus and Bulgaria. 
During the peak immigration period, Northam had the largest immigrant receiving facilities within the State and the third largest in Australia. By 1950, the camp housed 4,000 people and two new blocks of huts were built to accommodate them all. By May 1954, 23,000 migrants had passed through the Northam Camp once the Accommodation Centre had closed. A significant number of these post-war arrivals eventually settled in the Northam area.

===Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centre===
On 18 October 2010 the Yongah Hill (YHIDC) centre was announced as being established at the former Northam Army Training Camp. It was not opened until early 2012, however, and, after it was downsized from the original 1500 expected occupancy, talk of expansion has been happening.

It is run by Serco for the Department of Home Affairs.

Australian Border Force officers are also present at the centre.

In September 2018 a riot broke out at the centre and some buildings were set on fire, after a detainee was reportedly found in his cell injured after a suicide attempt. The detainee, who was a refugee, later died.

Also in September 2018, a guard was alleged to have sexually assaulted a detainee.

==Geography==
The town and hinterland of Northam are located in the Avon Valley - so named after the river the Avon River. It has been periodically flooded, and man-made banks protect the town from inundation. &quot;The Avon&quot; is a name commonly used by organisations, newspapers and sporting groups.

The river is spanned by a pedestrian suspension bridge; at , it is the longest such bridge in Australia.

Burlong Pool a pool just south of the town was known as the Burlong swimming pool, and in the 1890s the location of the source of water for the Goldfields water trains.

===Climate===
Northam has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.

=== 2011 ===
A severe thunderstorm lashed the town and surrounding areas on 27 January 2011 resulting in roofs being ripped off, trees being uprooted and power lines being brought down.
About 50 houses were damaged in the town as a result of the storm but no injuries were reported.

=== 2021 ===
A flash flood occurred in the town and surrounding areas on 2 March 2021, with 40 millimetres of rainfall occurring in just half an hour. This resulted in many houses being damaged, as well as the Jubilee oval flooding, leaving silt all over the busy road of Peel Terrace.

==Government==
Originally, the town and surrounding area was split into two municipalities, the Town of Northam handling the affairs of the town, and the Shire of Northam which also manages other towns, such as Bakers Hill and Wundowie. After 53 years of debates and failed attempts, the two councils finally merged as of the 1 July 2007 to form a conglomerate council, simply known as the Shire of Northam.

The public sector is a large employer for residents of Northam and surrounding areas. The town of Northam is the main regional centre for the Central Wheatbelt region, and as such many local and state government departments choose to operate out of the town.

Services Australia operates a Centrelink office in the town.

==Tourism==
Northam has a number of tourist attractions, including hot air ballooning, wineries, cafes and restaurants, museums, hotels and motels.

==Transport==
Northam railway station is served by Transwa&#x27;s &quot;AvonLink, MerredinLink&quot; and &quot;The Prospector&quot; rural train services, and Great Southern Rail&#x27;s &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; to Sydney. Northam is connected to Perth via coach services N3 and N5.

===Railways===

Northam is a major railway junction, and serves as the commercial centre for much of the western Wheatbelt. The dual gauge Eastern Railway terminates here and becomes the standard gauge Eastern Goldfields Railway. Narrow gauge radiates both south of the town to York and beyond (Great Southern Railway), and north to Goomalling, another rural railway junction.

====Original railway station====
The original station on Fitzgerald Street was opened in 1900 and closed in 1966 when the new Eastern Railway route became operational.

The layout of the pre-1966 narrow gauge railway also had a busy junction at East Northam; this was removed on the completion of the new standard gauge railway.

====Avon Yard====
The Western Australian Government Railways originally created it as the &quot;Avon Marshalling Yard&quot;, and more recent operators in the yards such as Australian Railroad Group have named it the Avon Yard.

===Airport and roads===

==Education==

Northam has three public primary schools, a public high school, and a TAFE campus. It also has a private Catholic school, St Josephs which conducts classes from Kindergarten to Year 12, across two campuses.

=== Primary School ===
The original Northam Primary School was established in 1890, making it one of the states oldest primary schools. The current school opened in 1978 replacing the original structure, it is located on Duke Street. It was the first primary school of the area and has approximately over 300 students. West Northam Primary School is located on Habgood Street and has approximately 140 students. Avon Vale Primary School opened in 1954. It is located on Hutt Street and has approximately 140 students.

=== High School ===
Northam Senior High School is the public high school for the area. It is one of the oldest high schools in the state, opening in 1921. The main building is heritage listed, though the campus has had renovations and further additions added to it in 1986, 1996 and 2015 It has approximately 715 students. In Semester 2, 2020 the school became an Independent Public School. It has several specialized programs to meet the diverse needs of its students, such as the Big Picture Program, Clontarf Foundation, Wirrpanda Foundation, Deadly Sista Girlz and others. The school not only intakes students from the town of Northam, but also Year 10-12 students from the surrounding District High Schools, including the surrounding towns of Toodyay, York, Beverley, Goomalling and others. It also has a college for students that board that are from remote communities, Northam Residential College.

=== Private Education ===
Saint Josephs is a private Catholic school, with two campuses in Northam. It has approximately 600 students and teaches from Kindergarten to Year 12. The primary school campus, located on Lance Street, teaches students Kindergarten to Year 6. The high school campus, located on Wellington Street East, teaches students Year 7 to Year 12. This campus was opened in 1889 by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Apparition, while the Marist Brothers opened the Saint Pauls school in 1948 and 1971 before merging the schools together.

=== Tertiary Education ===
Northam has a TAFE campus, previously known as the C. Y. O&#x27;Connor Institute. It has since been merged with other regional TAFEs and trades under Central Regional TAFE.

Northam is also home to the Muresk Institute, one of Western Australia&#x27;s leading tertiary educators for agriculture.

==Sport==
Association Football (Soccer) has been played in Northam since just after World War Two. Due to the many European immigrants living at the Holden Camp a league was formed comprising nine teams from Northam and one from Wundowie. Many of the teams were based on ethnicity such as: Italian; Dutch; Polish; Hungarian; Romanian; Yugoslav; Austrian; German and Bulgarian. In recent years, Northam United FC was a men&#x27;s team whilst Northam Springfield FC is a children&#x27;s football club in its tenth season (2021). Springfield play in the winter against their rivals Toodyay Junior Soccer Club.

Northam has some very committed sporting teams. Australian rules football is an obsession with many of the people of Western Australia. Northam has two teams that play in the Avon Football Association competition, Federals and Railways.

Field and indoor hockey, cricket, and netball also attract significant numbers of players and spectators. Individual sports such as tennis and cycling including BMX are also popular.

The BMX State Championships were held in Northam in 2003 with 3,000 competitors and spectators attending the event for over a week with Northam competitors showing their dominance in the sport in the state. Three local riders who participated in this event (Dale Reynolds - then ranked 3WA for 18 Men&#x27;s, Chris Marris - then ranked 1WA for 18 Men&#x27;s, and Kyle Martin - then ranked 4WA for 18 Men&#x27;s) have subsequently completed cross country rides from Adelaide to Perth demonstrating the interest in cycling in Northam.

Steve Fossett became the first person to fly around the world alone, non-stop, in a hot air balloon when he launched from Northam on 19 June 2002, and returned to Australia on 3 July, landing in Queensland.

In July 2016 Russian adventurer and balloon pilot Fedor Konyukhov took off from Northam airfield to attempt a solo nonstop round the world balloon flight. He completed his circumnavigation, covering , in 11 days, 4 hours and 20 minutes, beating Fossett&#x27;s record by 52 hours.

Between 1952 and 1956 several motor racing events were held using streets within the town. The first circuit used was on the south side of the Avon River, but this was considered too dangerous, so a new circuit was built in 1956 on the north side of the river.

Thoroughbred horse racing is held at Northam Racecourse by the Northam Race Club. The track held its first race in 1863 and has about 22 race meetings during the year.

The town is also home to harness racing and greyhound racing.

== Events ==
The town of Northam is home to several iconic Western Australian events and activities.

The Avon Descent is an annual, two-day white water river race that begins in Northam, and travels 124 km down the Avon River, into the Swan River before finishing in Bayswater. It occurs each year in August, and allows both power craft and peddle craft.

The Northam Motorsport Festival occurs annually between the months of March and April and is the spiritual successor to the historical Northam Flying 50s event. It is a free event which incorporates three activities, the Mount Ommanney Hillclimb, the SCBC Motokhana and the iconic Northam Flying 50s, an event in which the main streets of Northam are used as a circuit in which classic cars may complete time trials and race. There also is a classic car show, and several other small promotions and specials put on by community members. The show attracts around 5,000 spectators annually.

The Northam Farmer&#x27;s Show is held annually on a Friday and Saturday in mid-September. It is an agricultural show similar to others held in the area, such as the York Show and the Toodyay Show.

The Kep Ultra running race is held each year on the Western Australia Day long weekend in early June. The race starts in Northam and includes 100 km and 75 km events finishing at Mundaring Weir.

==Military history==
During World War I, Wilberforce, an area on the Spencers Brook to York Road was the area set up for the breeding and selection of horses to be transported to overseas theatres of war involving Australian horseman in particular the iconic 10th Light Horse Regiment.

Also in November 1920, an area at Noggojerrring was purchased by the Federal Government for £7,000. It was an area of 875 acres(350 hectares) of farming land and was located four miles (6.5 kilometres) north of Northam on the Northam - Pithara Road. Of that area, 860 acres (344 hectares) were cleared and divided into 11 paddocks. The property was well watered, and carried a wind mill, two dwellings, three sheds, and a stable. The Goomalling railway bisected it. The Federal Government&#x27;s purpose was the settlement of tubercular soldiers. The place was christened Anzac Farm.

During World War II, Northam was the location of a number of important strategic military camps, depots and installations being the most concentrated of military activity areas in Western Australia. Due to its strategic geographical location and being close to water, the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, close to strategic railway junction, as it was close to the coast but inland, Northam became an important military hub.

The installations, camps, and depots were some of those developed in the Wheatbelt during 1939–1945, located within the Shire of Northam, some of which still exist today.

<doc id="535229" wikidata="Q2734705" url="?curid=535229" title="Linger (The Cranberries song)">
<text>&quot;Linger&quot; is a song by Irish alternative rock band the Cranberries from their debut studio album, &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot; (1993). Composed by band members Dolores O&#x27;Riordan and Noel Hogan, and produced by Stephen Street, &quot;Linger&quot; was first released as the second and final single from the album on 15 February 1993 by Island Records. It was later re-released on 31 January 1994.

&quot;Linger&quot;, which has an acoustic arrangement featuring a string section, became the band&#x27;s first major hit, peaking at number three in their native Ireland, number eight in the United States, and number 14 in the United Kingdom. The single remained on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 24 weeks and also peaked at number eleven on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100. Additionally, &quot;Linger&quot; was voted by Australian Triple J listeners as number three on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1993 chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Melodie McDaniel.

In 1990, &quot;Linger&quot; was released on a demo tape with &quot;Dreams&quot; in Ireland only in the middle of that year under their initial band name, the Cranberry Saw Us.
In 2017, an acoustic, stripped-down version of &quot;Linger&quot; was released as the lead single from the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Something Else&quot;. &quot;Linger&quot; is written in the key of D major.

==Background==
When O&#x27;Riordan was auditioned as the lead singer for the band, she wrote the lyrics, turning it into a song of regret based on an experience with a 17-year-old soldier she once fell in love with. Drummer Fergal Lawler recalled the process in an interview, saying:

In the documentary &quot;&quot;, O&#x27;Riordan says that the song is about her first serious kiss.

&quot;Linger&quot; has since become one of the band&#x27;s most famous songs, though O&#x27;Riordan noted that the band did not expect the song to reach the level of commercial success that it did. In a 2012 interview, O&#x27;Riordan commented, &quot;I remember when MTV first put &#x27;Linger&#x27; in heavy rotation, every time I walked into a diner or a hotel lobby, it was like, &#x27;Jesus, man, here I am again&#x27;. It was trippy, like Jacob&#x27;s Ladder. I didn&#x27;t even have to take drugs&quot;.

In an interview for &quot;NME&quot;, guitarist Noel Hogan said of the song:

==Critical reception==
Jason Elias of AllMusic described &quot;Linger&quot; as &quot;a song of regret, epic in scope and sweeping&quot;, praising the instrumentation and O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s vocals: &quot;While this isn&#x27;t lyrically novel, the full-on emotionality of lead singer Dolores O&#x27;Riordan makes this stand out. Singing in a strong Irish brogue she comes off both needy and detached here. It&#x27;s that emotion that powers this track&quot;. David Stubbs from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; commented, &quot;Fragile, underwhelming acoustic thing with strings in which the girl, in prim, unsullied Irish vowels, pleads for her partner to put her out of her misery and end the relationship he&#x27;s no longer interested in. Don&#x27;t all rush to Virgin Megastore at once.&quot; Upon the 1994 re-release, the magazine&#x27;s Caitlin Moran, concluded, &quot;Good songs never disappear; they just keep getting released and re-released until you capitulate and buy the f***er.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; wrote, &quot;Currently on tour with the Hothouse Flowers, these fellow Irishmen deserve your attention. Don&#x27;t hang round the bar, but move forwards to the stage to check out their alternative pop with shades of folk.&quot; 

Martin Aston from &quot;Music Week&quot; rated it four out of five, adding that it &quot;combines a gorgeous, melting vocal from Dolores with a delicate folky melody.&quot; Another &quot;Music Week&quot; editor, Alan Jones, named it a &quot;delightful single&quot;, noting that &quot;floating in on a breeze, it has a haunting, fragile quality and an almost country feel.&quot; Amanda Petrusich of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the song as &quot;a hazy, sentimental song about realizing that you&#x27;re on the bummer end of a lopsided relationship&quot;. Andrew Harrison from &quot;Select&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;Linger&#x27; has a lovely orchestra busying itself in the far distance and keeping the tune at arm&#x27;s length, while Delores gets powerfully lovelorn. Could do with more pedal steel, though.&quot; Tony Cross from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it five out of five and named it Best New Single, adding, &quot;Delores O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s voice comes straight from the chill out room and oils the song&#x27;s creaky form into fabulous, delicious and delicate motion. Settle back into an old leather sofa for a long, long time and let it linger.&quot; &quot;Linger&quot; was ranked at number 86 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;90s.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Linger&quot;, shot in black-and-white, was directed by American director Melodie McDaniel and based loosely on Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1965 science fiction noir film &quot;Alphaville&quot;—a &quot;film that considers the potency of desire&quot;. In one of the rooms of the hotel, a silent film is being shown which features 1950s stripper and burlesque performer Blaze Starr.

&quot;Linger&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV in 1993.

<doc id="535230" wikidata="Q298410" url="?curid=535230" title="Tahmasp I">
<text>Tahmasp I ( or ; 22 February 1514 – 14 May 1576) was the second shah of Safavid Iran from 1524 until his death in 1576. He was the eldest son of Shah Ismail I and his principal consort, Tajlu Khanum.

Tahmasp ascended the throne after the death of his father on 23 May 1524. The first years of Tahmasp&#x27;s reign were marked by civil wars between the Qizilbash leaders until 1532, when he asserted his authority and began an absolute monarchy. He soon faced a long-lasting war with the Ottoman Empire, which was divided into three phases. The Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, tried to install his own candidates on the Safavid throne. The war ended with the Peace of Amasya in 1555, with the Ottomans gaining sovereignty over Iraq, much of Kurdistan, and western Georgia. Tahmasp also had conflicts with the Uzbeks of Bukhara over Khorasan, with them repeatedly raiding Herat. In 1528, at the age of fourteen, he defeated the Uzbeks in the Battle of Jam by using artillery.

Tahmasp was a patron of the arts and was an accomplished painter himself. He built a royal house of arts for painters, calligraphers and poets. Later in his reign, he came to despise poets, shunning many and exiling them to the Mughal court of India. Tahmasp is known for his religious piety and fervent zealotry for the Shia branch of Islam. He bestowed many privileges on the clergy and allowed them to participate in legal and administrative matters. In 1544 he demanded that the fugitive Mughal emperor Humayun convert to Shi&#x27;ism in return for military assistance to reclaim his throne in India. Nevertheless, Tahmasp still negotiated alliances with the Christian powers of the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg monarchy who were also rivals of the Ottoman Empire.

His succession was disputed before his death. When Tahmasp died, a civil war followed, leading to the death of most of the royal family. Tahmasp&#x27;s reign of nearly fifty-two years was the longest of any member of the Safavid dynasty. Although contemporary Western accounts were critical, modern historians describe him as a courageous and able commander who maintained and expanded his father&#x27;s empire. His reign saw a shift in the Safavid ideological policy; he ended the worshipping of his father as the Messiah by the Turkoman Qizilbash tribes and instead established a public image of a pious and orthodox Shia king. He started a long process followed by his successors to end the Qizilbash influence on Safavid politics, replacing them with the newly introduced &#x27;third force&#x27; containing Islamized Georgians and Armenians.

== Name ==
&quot;Tahmasp&quot; () is a New Persian name, ultimately derived from Old Iranian &quot;*ta(x)ma-aspa&quot;, meaning &quot;having valiant horses.&quot; The name is one of the few instances of a name from the epic poem &quot;Shahnameh&quot; () being used by an Islamic-era dynasty based in Iran. In the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, Tahmasp is the father of Zaav, the penultimate shah of the mythical Persian Pishdadian dynasty.

== Background ==
Tahmasp was the second shah of the Safavid dynasty, a family of Kurdish origin, who were sheikhs of a Sufi (school of Sufism) known as the Safavid order and centred in Ardabil, a city in the northwestern Iran. The first sheikh of the order and eponym of the dynasty, Safi-ad-din Ardabili (d. 1334), married the daughter of Zahed Gilani (d. 1301) and became the master of his father-in-law&#x27;s order, the Zahediyeh. Two of Safi-ad-Din&#x27;s descendants, Shaykh Junayd (d. 1460) and his son, Shaykh Haydar (d. 1488), made the order more militant and unsuccessfully tried to expand their domain.

Tahmasp&#x27;s father, Ismail I (), who inherited the leadership the Safavid order from his brother, Ali Mirza, became shah of Iran in 1501, a state mired in civil war after the collapse of the Timurid Empire. He conquered the territories of the Aq Qoyunlu tribal confederation, the lands of the Chinggisid (Descendant of Genghis Khan) Uzbek Shaybanid dynasty in the eastern Iran, and many city-states by 1512. Ismail&#x27;s realm included the whole territory of modern Iran, in addition to sovereignty over Georgia, Armenia, Daghestan, and Shirvan in the west, and Herat in the east. Unlike his Sufist ancestors, Ismail believed in Twelver Shia Islam and made it the official religion of the realm. He forced conversion on the Sunni population by abolishing Sunni Sufi orders, seizing their property, and giving the Sunni (Islamic clergymen) a choice of conversion, death, or exile. From this, a power vacuum emerged which allowed the Shia to create a clerical aristocracy filled with (descendant of Muhammad) and (Islamic scholar expert in the Islamic law) landowners.

Ismail established the Qizilbash Turkoman tribes as inseparable members of the Safavid administration since they were the &quot;men of the sword&quot; who brought him to power. These &quot;men of the sword&quot; clashed with the other major part of his bureaucracy, the &quot;men of the pen&quot;, who controlled the literati and were mainly Persian. Ismail created the title of (deputy to the king) to resolve the dispute. The title of surpassed both the (commander-in-chief; mostly bestowed upon Qizilbash leaders), and the (minister and head of the bureaucracy) in authority. The holder of the title was the vicegerent of Ismail and represented him in the royal court. The creation of this new superior title could not cease the clashes between the Qizilbash leaders and Persian bureaucrats, which eventually climaxed in the Battle of Ghazdewan between the Safavids and the Uzbeks, in which Ismail&#x27;s , the Persian Najm-e Sani, commended the army. The Uzbek victory, during which Najm was captured and executed afterwards, was the result of the desertion of many of the Qizilbash.

The Uzbeks of Bukhara were a recurring problem on the Iranian eastern borders. The Safavids and the Shaybanids rose to power almost simultaneously at the turn of the sixteenth century. By 1503, when Ismail I had taken possession of large parts of the Iranian plateau, Muhammad Shaybani, Khan of Bukhara (), had conquered Khwarazm and Khorasan. Ismail defeated and killed Muhammad Shaybani in the Battle of Marv in 1510, returning Khorasan to Iranian possession, though Khwarazm and the Persianate cities in Transoxiana remained in Uzbek hands. Thereafter the possession of Khorasan became the main bone of contention between Safavids and Shaybanids.

In 1514, Ismail&#x27;s prestige and authority were damaged by his loss in the Battle of Chaldiran against the Ottoman Empire. Before the war with the Ottomans, Ismail promoted himself as a reincarnation of Ali or Husayn. This belief weakened after Chaldiran, and Ismail lost his theological-religious relationship with the disappointed Qizilbash tribes who had previously seen him as invincible. This affected Ismail, who began drinking heavily and never again led an army; this permitted the seizure of power by the Qizilbash tribes which overshadowed Tahmasp&#x27;s early reign.

== Early life ==
Abu&#x27;l-Fath Tahmasp Mirza was born on 22 February 1514 in Shahabad, a village near Isfahan, as the eldest son of Ismail I and his principal consort, Tajlu Khanum. According to the narrative told by Iranian &quot;s&quot; (coffeehouse storytellers), on the night of Tahmasp&#x27;s birth, a storm erupted, with wind, rain, and lightning. Tajlu Khanum, feeling her labour pains beginning, suggested that the royal caravan camp in some village. The royal caravan thus headed to Shahabad. The (warden) of the village was a Sunni and did not let Tajlu Khanum enter his house, but a Shia resident of the village welcomed her into his modest house. By then, Tajlu Begum&#x27;s pain had made her faint, and shortly after entering the house gave birth to a son. When the news reached Ismail, he was reportedly &quot;heaped&quot; with utmost joy and happiness, but refrained from seeing his son until his astrologers gave him an auspicious date to do so. When the auspicious hour arrived, the young boy was presented to Ismail and astrologers foresaw his future to be one entwisted with war and peace and that he would have many sons. Ismail named the boy Tahmasp after Ali, the first Imam, told him to do so in his dream.
In 1516, when Tahmasp Mirza was two years old, the province of Khorasan became his fief by Ismail&#x27;s order. This appointment was specially done to emulate the Timurid dynasty, that followed the Turco-Mongol tradition of appointing the eldest son of a sovereign to govern a prominent province like Khorasan. The centre of this major province, the city of Herat, would go on to be the city where Safavid crown princes were raised, trained, and educated throughout the sixteenth century. In 1517, Ismail appointed the Diyarbakr governor Amir Soltan Mawsillu as Tahmasp&#x27;s (tutor) and governor of Balkh, a city in Khorasan. He replaced the Shamlu and Mawsillu governors of Khorasan, who did not join his army during the Battle of Chaldiran for fear of famine. Placing Tahmasp in Herat was an attempt to reduce the growing influence of the Shamlu tribe, which dominated Safavid court politics and held a number of powerful governorships. Ismail also appointed Amir Ghiyath al-Din Mohammad, a prominent Herat figure, as Tahmasp&#x27;s religious tutor.

A struggle for control of Herat emerged between the two tutors. Amir Soltan arrested Ghiyath al-Din and executed him the following day, but was ousted from his position in 1521 by a sudden raid by the Uzbeks who crossed the Amu Darya and seized portions of the city. Ismail appointed Div Sultan Rumlu as Tahmasp&#x27;s , and the governorship was given to his younger son, Sam Mirza Safavi. During his years in Herat, Tahmasp developed a love for writing and painting. He became an accomplished painter and dedicated a work to his brother, Bahram Mirza. The painting was a humorous composition of a gathering of Safavid courtiers, featuring music, singing, and wine-drinking.

In the spring of 1524, Ismail became ill on a hunting trip to Georgia and recovered in Ardabil on his way back to the capital. But he soon developed a high fever which led to his death on 23 May 1524 in Tabriz.

== Regency ==

The ten-year-old Tahmasp ascended the throne after his father&#x27;s death under the guardianship of Div Sultan Rumlu, his , the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the realm. Rule by a member of the Rumlu tribe was unacceptable to the other Turkoman tribes of the Qizilbash, especially the Ostajlu and Takkalu. Kopek Sultan, governor of Tabriz and leader of Ostajlu, along with Chuha Sultan, leader of the Takkalu tribe, were Div Sultan Rumlu&#x27;s strongest opponents. The Takkalu were powerful in Isfahan and Hamadan, and the Ostajlu held Khorasan and the Safavid capital, Tabriz. Rumlu proposed a triumvirate to the two leaders which was accepted, the terms were for sharing the office of . The triumvirate proved unsustainable, since all sides were dissatisfied with their share of power. In the spring of 1526, a series of battles in northwest Iran between these tribes expanded into Khorasan and became a civil war. The Ostajlu faction was quickly excluded and their leader, Kopek Sultan, was killed by order of Chuha Sultan. During the civil war, the Uzbeks raiders temporarily seized Tus and Astarabad. Div Sultan Rumlu was blamed for the raids and was executed. His execution was performed by Tahmasp himself.

At the behest of the young king, Chuha Sultan, the sole remaining member of the triumvirate, became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the realm from 1527 to 1530. Chuha tried to remove Herat from Shamlu dominance, which led to a conflict between the two tribes. In early 1530, the Herat governor, Hossein Khan Shamlu, and his men killed Chuha and executed every Takkalu in the retinue of the shah in the royal camp. This provoked the Takkalu tribe to rebellion, and a few days later, in an act of retaliation, they attacked the shah&#x27;s retinue in Hamadan. One of the tribesman attempted to abduct the young Tahmasp, who had him put to death. Then Tahmasp ordered the general slaughter of the Takkalu tribe; many were killed, and many fled to Baghdad, where the governor, himself a Takkalu, put some to death to prove his loyalty. Eventually, the remaining Takkalu managed to flee to the Ottoman Empire. In the contemporary chronicles, the downfall of Chuha Sultan and the massacre of his tribe is dubbed &quot;the Takkalu pestilence&quot;. Hossein Khan Shamlu thereafter assumed Chuha Sultan&#x27;s position with the consent of the Qizilbash leaders.

While the civil war was ongoing among the Qizilbash, the Uzbeks under Ubayd Allah Khan conquered the borderlands. In 1528, Ubayd reconquered Astarabad and Tus and besieged Herat. Fourteen-year-old Tahmasp commanded the army and defeated the Uzbeks, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Jam. Safavid superiority in the battle was due to many different factors, one of them being their use of artillery, which they had learned from the Ottomans. The then governor of Herat and Tahmasp&#x27;s regent, Hossein Khan Shamlu, distinguished himself during the battle and earned the respect of the shah. The victory, however, reduced neither the Uzbek threat nor the realm&#x27;s internal chaos, since Tahmasp had to return to the west to suppress a rebellion in Baghdad. That year, the Uzbeks captured Herat; however, they allowed Sam Mirza to return to Tabriz. Their occupation did not last long, and Tahmasp drove them out in the summer of 1530. He appointed his brother, Bahram Mirza, governor of Khorasan and Ghazi Khan Takkalu, as Bahram&#x27;s tutor.

By this point, Tahmasp had turned seventeen, and thus no longer needed a regent. Hossein Khan Shamlu circumvented this challenge by having himself named as the steward to Tahmasp&#x27;s newborn son, Mohammad Mirza. Hossein Khan constantly undermined the shah&#x27;s power and had angered Tahmasp many times. His confidence in his power, combined with the rumours that Hossein Khan intended to depose Tahmasp and place his brother, Sam Mirza, on the throne, finally led Tahmasp to rid himself of the powerful Shamlu amir. Thus Hossein Khan was overthrown and executed in 1533. His fall was a turning point for Tahmasp, who now knew that each Turkoman leader would favour his tribe. He reduced the influence of the Qizilbash and gave the &quot;men of the pen&quot; bureaucracy greater power, ending the regency.

== Reign ==

=== Ottoman war ===
Suleiman the Magnificent (), sultan of the Ottoman Empire, may have considered a strong Safavid empire a threat to his ambitious plans in the west and northwest of his realm. During the first decade of Tahmasp&#x27;s reign, however, he was preoccupied with fighting the Habsburgs and the unsuccessful attempt to seize Vienna. In 1532, while the Ottomans were fighting in Hungary, Suleiman sent Olama Beg Takkalu with 50,000 troops under Fil Pasha to Iran. Olama Beg was one of many Takkalu members who, after Chuha&#x27;s death, took refuge in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans seized Tabriz and Kurdistan, and tried to obtain support from Gilan province. Tahmasp drove the Ottomans out, but news of another Uzbek invasion prevented him from defeating them. Suleiman sent his grand vizier, Ibrahim Pasha, to occupy Tabriz in July 1534 and joined him two months later. Suleiman peacefully conquered Baghdad and Shia cities such as Najaf. Whilst the Ottomans were on the march, Tahmasp was in Balkh, campaigning against the Uzbeks.

The first Ottoman invasion caused the greatest crisis of Tahmasp&#x27;s reign. Its events however are difficult to reconstruct; on an unknown date, an agent from the Shamlu tribe unsuccessfully tried to poison Tahmasp; they revolted against the shah, who had recently asserted his authority by removing Hossein Khan. Seeking to dethrone Tahmasp, they chose one of his younger brothers, Sam Mirza (who had a Shamlu guardian) as their candidate. The rebels then contacted Suleiman and asked him for support in enthroning Sam Mirza, who promised to follow a pro-Ottoman policy. Suleiman recognised him as ruler of Iran, which panicked Tahmasp&#x27;s court. Tahmasp reconquered the seized territory when Suleiman went to Mesopotamia, and Suleiman led another campaign against him. Tahmasp attacked his rearguard, and Suleiman was forced to retreat to Istanbul at the end of 1535 after losing all his gains except Baghdad. After confronting the Ottomans, Tahmasp rushed to Khorasan to defeat his brother. Sam Mirza surrendered and sought mercy from Tahmasp. The shah accepted his brother&#x27;s pleads and banished him to Qazvin but otherwise executed many of his advisors, namely, his Shamlu guardian.

Relations with the Ottomans remained hostile until the revolt of Alqas Mirza, another one of Tahmasp&#x27;s younger brothers, who had led the Safavid army during the 1534–35 Ottoman invasion and was governor of Shirvan. He led an unsuccessful revolt against Tahmasp, who conquered Derbant in the spring of 1547 and appointed his son Ismail as governor. Alqas fled to Crimea with his remaining forces and took refuge with Suleiman. He promised to restore Sunni Islam in Iran and encouraged the Sultan to lead another campaign against Tahmasp. The new invasion sought the quick capture of Tabriz in July 1548; it soon became clear, however, that Alqas Mirza&#x27;s claims of support from all the Qizilbash leaders were untrue. The long campaign focused on looting, plundering Hamadan, Qom, and Kashan before being stopped at Isfahan. Tahmasp did not fight the exhausted Ottoman army but laid waste the entire region from Tabriz to the frontier; the Ottomans could not permanently occupy the captured lands, since they soon ran out of supplies.

Eventually, Alqas Mirza was captured on the battlefield and imprisoned in a fortress, where he died. Suleiman ended his campaign, and by the fall of 1549 the remaining Ottoman forces retreated. The Ottoman sultan launched his last campaign against the Safavids in May 1554, when Ismail Mirza (Tahmasp&#x27;s son) invaded eastern Anatolia and defeated Erzerum governor Iskandar Pasha. Suleiman marched from Diyarbakr towards Armenian Karabakh and reconquered the lost lands. Tahmasp divided his army into four corps and sent each in a different direction, indicating a Safavid army that had grown much larger than it was in the previous wars. With Tahmasp&#x27;s Safavids holding the advantage, Suleiman had to retreat. The Ottomans negotiated the Peace of Amasya, in which Tahmasp recognised Ottoman sovereignty in Mesopotamia and much of Kurdistan; furthermore, as an act of obeisance towards Sunni Islam and Sunnis, he banned the holding of (a festival commemorating the assassination of the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab) and expressing hatred towards the Rashidun caliphs, who are held dear by the Sunni Muslims. The Ottomans allowed Iranian pilgrims to travel freely to Mecca, Medina, Karbala, and Najaf. Through this treaty, Iran had time to increase its forces and resources as its western provinces had the opportunity to recuperate from the war. This peace also demarcated the Ottoman-Safavid frontier in the north-west without the cession of large areas of territory on the Safavid side. These terms, in circumstances favourable to the Safavids, were evidence of the frustration felt by Suleiman the Magnificent at his inability to inflict a greater defeat on the Safavids.

=== Georgian campaigns ===
Tahmasp was interested in the Caucasus, especially Georgia, for two reasons: to reduce the influence of the Ostajlu tribe (who kept their lands in southern Georgia and Armenia after the 1526 civil war) and a desire for booty, similar to that of his father. Since the Georgians were mainly Christian, he used the pretext of (Islamic armed struggle against nonbelievers) to justify the invasion. Between 1540 and 1553, Tahmasp led four campaigns against the Georgian kingdoms. The Safavid army looted Tbilisi, including its churches and the wives and children of the nobility, in the first campaign. Tahmasp also forced the governor of Tbilisi, Golbad, to convert to Islam. The King of Kartli, Luarsab I (), managed to escape and went to hiding during Tahmasp&#x27;s raiding. During his second invasion, ostensibly to ensure the stability of Georgian territory, he looted the farms and subjugated Levan of Kakheti (). One year before the Peace of Amasya in 1554, Tahmasp led his last military campaign into the Caucasus. Throughout his campaigns, he took many prisoners, and this time he brought 30,000 Georgians to Iran. Luarsab&#x27;s mother, Nestan Darejan was captured during these campaigns, but committed suicide upon incarceration. The descendants of these prisoners formed a &quot;third force&quot; in the Safavid administration and bureaucracy with the Turkomans and Persians and became a main rival to the other two during the later years of the Safavid Empire. Although this &quot;third force&quot; came to power two generations later during the reign of Tahmasp&#x27;s grandson, Abbas the Great (), it began infiltrating Tahmasp&#x27;s army during the second quarter of his reign as (slave warriors) and (royal bodyguards of the shah) and became more influential at the apex of the Safavid empire.

In 1555, following the Peace of Amasya, eastern Georgia remained in Iranian hands and western Georgia was ruled by the Turks. Never again did Tahmasp appear on the Caucasus frontier after the treaty. Instead, the Governor of Georgia, Shahverdi Sultan, represented Safavid power north of the Aras River. Tahmasp sought to establish his dominance by imposing several Iranian political and social institutions and placing converts to Islam on the thrones of Kartli and Kakheti; one was Davud Khan, brother of Simon I of Kartli (). Son of Levan of Kakheti, Prince Jesse also appeared in Qazvin during the 1560s and converted to Islam. In return, Tahmasp granted him favours and gifts. The prince was given the old royal palace for his residence in Qazvin, and became the governor of Shaki and adjacent territories. The conversion of these Georgian princes did not dissuade the Georgian forces who tried to reconquer Tbilisi under Simon I and his father, Luarsab I of Kartli, in the Battle of Garisi; the battle ended in a stalemate, with Luarsab and the Safavid commander Shahverdi Sultan both slain in battle.

=== Royal refugees ===

One of the most celebrated events of Tahmasp&#x27;s reign was the visit of Humayun (), the eldest son of Babur () and emperor of the Mughal Empire, who faced rebellions by his brothers. Humayun fled to Herat, travelled through Mashhad, Nishapur, Sabzevar, and Qazvin, and met Tahmasp at Soltaniyeh in 1544. Tahmasp honoured Homayun as a guest and gave him an illustrated version of Saadi&#x27;s &quot;Gulistan&quot; dating back to the reign of Abu Sa&#x27;id Mirza (), Humayun&#x27;s great-grandfather; however, he refused to give him political assistance unless he converted to Shia Islam. Humayun reluctantly agreed, but reverted to Sunni Islam when he returned to India; however he did not force the Iranian Shias, who came with him to India, to convert. Tahmasp also demanded a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; in which the city of Kandahar would be given to his infant son, Morad Mirza. Humayun spent Nowruz in the Shah&#x27;s court and left in 1545 with an army provided by Tahmasp to regain his lost lands; his first conquest was Kandahar, which he ceded to the young Safavid prince. Morad Mirza soon died, however, and the city became a bone of contention between the two empires: the Safavids claimed that it had been given to them in perpetuity, while the Mughals maintained that it had been an appanage that expired with the death of the prince. Tahmasp began the first Safavid expedition to Kandahar in 1558, after the death of Humayun, and reconquered the city.

Another notable visitor to Tahmasp&#x27;s court was Şehzade Bayezid, the fugitive Ottoman prince who rebelled against his father, Suleiman the Magnificent, and went to the Shah in the autumn 1559 with an army of 10,000 to persuade him to begin a war against the Ottomans. Although he honoured Bayezid, Tahmasp did not want to disturb the Peace of Amasya. Suspecting that Bayezid was planning a coup, he had him arrested and returned to the Ottomans; Bayezid and his children were immediately executed.

=== Later life and death ===
Although Tahmasp rarely left Qazvin from the Peace of Amasya in 1555 to his death in 1576, he was still active during this period. A 1564 rebellion in Herat was suppressed by Masum Bek and the Khorasan governors, but the region remained troubled and was raided by the Uzbeks two years later. Tahmasp became seriously ill in 1574 and neared death twice in two months. Since he had not chosen a crown prince, the question of succession was raised by members of the royal family and Qizilbash leaders. His favourite son, Haydar Mirza, was supported by the Ustajlu tribe and the powerful Georgian court faction; the imprisoned prince Ismail Mirza was supported by Pari Khan Khanum, Tahmasp&#x27;s influential daughter. The pro-Haydar faction tried to eliminate Ismail by winning the favour of the castellan of Qahqaheh Castle (where Ismail was imprisoned), but Pari Khan learned about the plot and informed Tahmasp; the shah, who was still fond of his son, ordered him to be guarded by Afshar musketeers.

Tahmasp, recovered from his illness, returned his attention to affairs of state. Remaining court tensions, however, triggered another civil war when the shah died on 14 May 1576 from poisoning. The poisoning was blamed on Abu Naser Gilani, a physician who attended Tahmasp when he was ill. According to &quot;Tarikh-e Alam-ara-ye Abbasi&quot;, &quot;He unwisely sought recognition of his superior status vis-à-vis the other physicians; as a result, when Tahmasp died, Abu Nasr was accused of treachery in the treatment he had prescribed, and he was put to death within the palace by members of the &quot;. Tahmasp I had the longest reign of any member of the Safavid dynasty: nine days short of fifty-two years. He died without a designated heir and the two factions in his court clashed for the throne. Haydar Mirza was murdered not long after his father&#x27;s death, and Ismail Mirza became king and was crowned Ismail II (). Less than two months after his enthronement, Ismail ordered a mass purge of all male members of the royal family. Only Mohammad Khodabanda, already nearly blind, and his three toddler sons survived this purge.

== Policies ==

=== Administration ===
Tahmasp&#x27;s reign after the civil wars between the Qizilbash leaders became a &quot;personal rule&quot; that sought to control Turkoman influence by empowering the Persian bureaucracy. The key change was the 1535 appointment of Qazi Jahan Qazvini, who extended diplomacy beyond Iran by establishing contact with the Portuguese, the Venetians, the Mughals, and the Shiite Deccan sultanates. English explorer Anthony Jenkinson, who was received at the Safavid court in 1562, also sought to promote trade. The Habsburgs were eager to ally with the Safavids against the Ottomans. In 1529, Ferdinand I () sent an envoy to Iran with the objective of a two-front attack on the Ottoman Empire the following year. The mission was unsuccessful, however, since the envoy took over a year to return. The first extant Safavid letters to a European power were sent in 1540 to Doge of Venice Pietro Lando (). In response, the Doge and the Great Council of Venice commissioned Michel Membré to visit the Safavid court. In 1540, he visited Tahmasp&#x27;s encampment at Marand, near Tabriz. Membré&#x27;s mission lasted for three years, during which, he wrote the &quot;Relazione di Persia&quot;, one of the few European sources which describe Tahmasp&#x27;s court. In his letter to Lando, Tahmasp promised to &quot;cleanse the earth of [Ottoman] wickedness&quot; with the help of the Holy League. The alliance, however, never bore fruit.

One of the most important events of Tahmasp&#x27;s reign was his relocation of the Safavid capital, which began what is known as the Qazvin period. Although the exact date is uncertain, Tahmasp began preparations to have the royal capital moved from Tabriz to Qazvin during a 1540s period of ethnic re-settlement. The move from Tabriz to Qazvin discontinued the Turco-Mongol tradition of shifting between summer and winter pastures with the herds, ending Ismail I&#x27;s nomadic lifestyle. The idea of a Turkoman state with a center in Tabriz was abandoned for an empire centered on the Iranian plateau. Moving into a city that linked the realm to Khorasan through an ancient route, allowed a greater degree of centralisation as distant provinces such as Shirvan, Georgia, and Gilan were brought into the Safavid fold. The incorporation of Gilan in particular was vital to the Safavids. To ensure his permanent control on the province, Tahmasp arranged royal marriages with the influential families in Gilan. Qazvin&#x27;s non-Qizilbash population allowed Tahmasp to bring new members to his court who were unrelated to the Turkoman tribes. The city, associated with orthodoxy and stable governance, developed under Tahmasp&#x27;s patronage; the era&#x27;s foremost building is Chehel Sotoun.

From the transition of capitals, a new era in history-writing emerged under Tahmasp&#x27;s rule. The Safavid historiography, which until then relied only on historians outside of Safavid&#x27;s influence, matured and became a valued project in Tahmasp&#x27;s new court. Tahmasp is the only Safavid monarch to have recorded his memories, known as &quot;Tazkera-ye Shah Tahmasb&quot;. On the shah&#x27;s behalf, Abdi Beg Shirazi, a secretary-accountant in the royal chancellery, wrote a world history named &quot;Takmelat al-akhbar&quot;, which he dedicated it to Pari Khan Khanum, Tahmasp&#x27;s daughter. Although intended to be a world history, only the last part of the book which covers the reigns of Ismail I and Tahmasp up until 1570 was published. He also commissioned Abol-Fath Hosseini to rewrite &quot;Safvat as-safa&quot;, the oldest surviving text regarding Safi-ad-din Ardabili and the Sufi beliefs of the Safavids, in order to legitimise his claim. All of the historians under Tahmasp&#x27;s patronage centred their works around one main goal: to tell the history of the Safavid dynasty. They defined themselves as &#x27;Safavid&#x27; historians, as living in a Safavid period of Iranian history, a concept that had not been seen in the earlier chronicles of the dynasty. This new definement has its roots in the change of the capital and the urbanisation of the Safavid nomadic lifestyle. Historians such as Charles Melville and Sholeh Quinn thus consider Tahmasp&#x27;s reign as the start of the &quot;real flourishing of Safavid historiography&quot;.

=== Military ===
The Safavid military evolved during Tahmasp&#x27;s reign. The first corps of gunners () and musketeers (), developed initially during Ismail I&#x27;s reign, came to be used in his army. A court chronicle&#x27;s retelling of Battle of Jam and a military review in 1530 show that the Safavid army was armed with several hundred light canons and several thousand infantrymen. , military slaves developed by Tahmasp from Caucasus prisoners, commanded the and . To lessen Qizilbash power, he discontinued the titles of and . The (the commander of the &quot;s&quot;), formerly subordinate to the , became the chief Safavid military officer.

After the Peace of Amasya in 1555, Tahmasp became an avaricious person who did not care how and where his troops obtained their pay, even if it was through criminal means. By 1575, Iran&#x27;s troops had not been paid for four years. They are said to have accepted this because, as one chronicler put it, &#x27;they loved the shah so much&#x27;.

=== Religion ===

Tahmasp described himself as a &quot;pious Shia mystic king&quot;. His religious views and the extent to which they influenced Safavid religious policy is the most interesting aspect of his reign for historians, both contemporary and modern. As the Italian historian Biancamaria Scarcia Amoretti has noted, &quot;the modern originality of Persian Shi&#x27;ism has its roots [with Shah Tahmasp]&quot;. Until 1533, the Qizilbash leaders (worshipping Ismail I as the promised Mahdi) urged the young Tahmasp to continue in his father&#x27;s footsteps; that year, he had a spiritual rebirth, performed an act of repentance and outlawed irreligious behaviour. Tahmasp rejected his father&#x27;s claim of being a mahdi, becoming a mystical lover of Ali and a king bound to sharia, but still enjoyed villagers travelling to his palace in Qazvin to touch his clothing. Tahmasp held firmly to the controversial Shia belief in the imminent coming of the Mahdi. He refused to allow his favourite sister, Shahzada Sultanim, to marry, because he was keeping her as a bride for the Mahdi. He claimed connections with Ali and Sufi saints, such as his ancestor Safi al-Din, through dreams in which he foresaw the future. Tahmasp had other superstitious beliefs too; for instance, his obsession with the occult science of geomancy. According to the Venetian diplomat, Vincenzo degli Alessandri, the shah was so devoted to practice geomancy that he had not left his palace for a decade. He also observed that Tahmasp was worshipped by his people as a godlike being possessing a frail and old body. Tahmasp wanted the poets of his court to write about Ali, rather than him. He sent copies of the Quran as gifts to several Ottoman sultans; overall, during his reign, eighteen copies of the Quran were sent to Istanbul and all were encrusted with jewels and gold.

Tahmasp saw Twelverism as a new doctrine of kingship, giving the authority in religious and legal matters, and appointing Shaykh Ali al-Karaki as the deputy of the Hidden Imam. This brought new political and court power to the (Islamic clerics), , and their networks, intersecting Tabriz, Qazvin, Isfahan, and the recently incorporated centres of Rasht, Astarabad, and Amol. As observed by Iskandar Beg Munshi, the court chronicler, the as a class of landed elite enjoyed considerable power. During the 1530s and 1540s, they hegemonised the Safavid court in Tabriz and according to Iskandar Beg, &quot;any wish of theirs was translated into reality almost before it was uttered… although they were guilty of unlawful practices&quot;. During Tahmasp&#x27;s reign, Persian scholars accepted the Safavid claims to heritage and called him &quot;the Husaynid&quot;. Tahmasp embarked on a wide-scale urban program designed to reinvent the city of Qazvin as a centre of Shiite piety and orthodoxy, expanding the Shrine of Husayn (son of Ali al-Rida, the eighth Imam). He was also attentive to his ancestral Sufi order in Ardabil, building the Janat Sarai mosque to encourage visitors and hold (Sufi spiritual ceremony). Tahmasp ordered the practice of Sufi rituals and had Sufis and come to his palace and perform public acts of piety and (a form of Islamic meditation) for Eid al-Fitr (and renew their allegiance to him). This encouraged Tahmasp&#x27;s followers to see themselves as belonging to a community too large to be bound by tribal or other local social orders. Although Tahmasp continued the Shia conversion in Iran, unlike his father he did not coerce other religious groups; he had a long-established acknowledgment and patronage of Christian Armenians.

=== Arts ===

In his youth, Tahmasp was inclined towards calligraphy and art and patronised masters in both. His preeminent and acclaimed contribution to the Safavid arts was his patronage of Persian miniature manuscripts that took place during the first half of his reign. He was the namesake of one of the most celebrated illustrated manuscripts of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, which was commissioned by his father around 1522 and completed during the mid-1530s. He encouraged painters such as Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād, bestowing a royal painting workshop for masters, journeymen, and apprentices with exotic materials such as ground gold and lapis lazuli. Tahmasp&#x27;s artists illustrated the &quot;Khamsa of Nizami&quot;, and he worked on Chehel Sotoun&#x27;s balcony paintings. The &quot;Tarikh-e Alam-ara-ye Abbasi&quot; calls Tahmasp&#x27;s reign the zenith of Safavid calligraphic and pictorial art. Tahmasp lost interest in the miniature arts around 1555 and, accordingly, disbanded the royal workshop and allowed his artists to practice elsewhere. His patronage of arts, however, has been praised by many modern art historians such as James Elkins and Stuart Cary Welch. The American historian, Douglas Streusand, calls him &#x27;the greatest Safavid patron&#x27;. Colin P. Mitchell associates Tahmasp&#x27;s patronage with the revival of Iranian artistic and cultural life.

The reigns of Tahmasp and his father, Ismail I, are considered as the most productive era of the history of the Azeri Turkish language and literature. The renowned poet, Fuzuli, who wrote in Azeri Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, flourished during this era. In his memoir, Tahmasp denotes his love for both Persian and Turkish poetry. During the later years of his life, however, he came to despise poets and poetry; as his devotion to the Quran increased, he no longer counted poets as pious men, for many of them were addicted to wine, an irreligious behaviour. Tahmasp refused to allow poets in his court and ceased to regard them with favour. According to &quot;Tazkera-ye Tohfe-ye Sāmi&quot; by his brother, Sam Mirza, there were 700 poets during the reigns of the first two Safavid kings. After Tahmasp&#x27;s religious conversion, many joined Humayun; those who remained and wrote erotic (sonnets), such as Vahshi Bafqi and Mohtasham Kashani, were shunned. Other poets such as Naziri Nishapuri and &#x27;Orfi Shirazi chose to leave Iran and emigrate to the Mughal court, where they pioneered the rise of Indian-style poetry (), known for its high-rhetorical texts of metaphors, mystical-philosophical themes and allegories.

== Coinage ==
Tahmasp I&#x27;s coins were characterised by the region they were minted in. The was used in Shirvan; in Mazandaran, was minted, and Khuzestan used the currency. By the 1570s, most of these autonomous monetary were unified. The weight of the &quot;shahi&quot; coins decreased significantly from at the beginning of Tahmasp&#x27;s reign to in the western parts of the realm and in the east at the end. These weight reductions were the results of Ottoman and Uzbek invasions as well as the Ottoman trade ban which had a devastating impact on trade, and thus on the shah&#x27;s revenues. According the Venetian Michel Membré, no merchant could have travelled to Iran through Ottoman borders without permission from the sultan. All travellers were stopped and arrested if they had no royal permit.

In his coins, Arabic is no longer the only language used, in his (&quot;folus-i shahi&quot;) coins, the phrase &quot;May be eternally [condemned] to the damnation of God / He, who alters [the rate of] the royal folus&quot; is minted in Persian. Old copper coins were released anew with the countermarks &quot;folus-i shahi&quot;, &quot;&#x27;adl-e shahi&quot;, etc. that showed their new value.

== Family ==
Tahmasp, unlike his ancestors who married Turkomans, took Georgians and Circassians as wives; most of his children had Caucasian mothers. His only Turkoman consort was his chief wife, Sultanum Begum of the Mawsillu tribe (a marriage of state), who gave birth to two sons: Mohammad Khodabanda and Ismail II. Tahmasp had a poor relationship with Ismail, whom he imprisoned on suspicion that his son might attempt a coup against him. However, he was attentive to his other children; On his orders, his daughters were instructed in administration, art, and scholarship, and Haydar Mirza (his favourite son, born of a Georgian slave) participated in state affairs.

Tahmasp had seven known consorts:
* Sultanum Begum (c. 15161593 in Qazvin), Tahmasp&#x27;s chief wife, from the Mawsillu tribe, mother of his two older sons
* Sultan-Agha Khanum, a Kumyk, sister of Shamkhal Sultan Cherkes (governor of Sakki), mother of Pari Khan Khanum and Suleiman Mirza
* Sultanzada Khanum, a Georgian slave, mother of Haydar Mirza
* Zahra Baji, a Georgian, mother of Mustafa Mirza and Ali Mirza
* Huri Khan Khanum, a Georgian, mother of Zeynab Begum and Maryam Begum
* A sister of Waraza Shalikashvili
* Zaynab Sultan Khanum (m. 1549; died in Qazvin October 1570 and buried in Mashhad), widow of Tahmasp&#x27;s younger brother Bahram Mirza

He had thirteen sons:
* Mohammad Khodabanda (1532 – 1595 or 1596), Shah of Iran (r. 1578–1587)
* Ismail II (31 May 1537 – 24 November 1577), Shah of Iran (r. 1576–77)
* Murad Mirza (d. 1545), nominal governor of Kandahar; died in infancy
* Suleiman Mirza (d. 9 November 1576), Governor of Shiraz, killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge
* Haydar Mirza (28 September 1556 – 15 May 1576), self-proclaimed Shah of Iran for a day after Tahmasp&#x27;s death; killed by his guards in Qazvin
* Mustafa Mirza, (d. 9 November 1576), killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge; his daughter married Abbas the Great
* Junayd Mirza (d. 1577), killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge
* Mahmud Mirza (d. 7 March 1577), governor of Shirvan and Lahijan, killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge
* Imam Qoli Mirza (died 7 March 1577), killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge
* Ali Mirza (d. 31 January 1642), blinded and imprisoned by Abbas the Great
* Ahmad Mirza (died 7 March 1577), killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge
* Murad Mirza (d. 1577), killed during Ismail II&#x27;s purge
* Zayn al-Abedin Mirza, died in childhood
* Musa Mirza, died in childhood

Tahmasp probably had thirteen daughters, eight of whom are known:
* Gawhar Sultan Begum (d. 1577), married Sultan Ibrahim Mirza
* Pari Khan Khanum (d. 1578), died by the orders of Khayr al-Nisa Begum
* Zeynab Begum (d. 31 May 1640), married Ali-Qoli Khan Shamlu
* Maryam Begum (d. 1608), married Khan Ahmad Khan
* Shahrbanu Khanum, married Salman Khan Ustajlu
* Khadija Begum (d. after 1564), married Jamshid Khan (grandson of Amira Dabbaj, a local ruler in western Gilan)
* Fatima Sultan Khanum (d. 1581), married Amir Khan Mawsillu
* Khanish Begum, married Shah Nimtullah Amir Nizam al-Din Abd al-Baqi (leader of the Ni&#x27;matullāhī order)

== Legacy ==
Tahmasp I&#x27;s reign started in an era of civil wars between the Qizilbash leaders after the death of Ismail I, whose charismatic characterisation as Messiah, which had driven the Qizilbash to follow him, came to an end with Tahmasp&#x27;s succession. In contrast to his father, Tahmasp did not possess charisma in any political or spiritual sense, nor was he old enough to prove himself a fierce warrior on the battlefield, a quality valued by the Qizilbash. Eventually, Tahmasp did overcome that challenge; he proved himself a worthy military commander in the Battle of Jam against the Uzbeks and, instead of facing the Ottomans directly in the battlefield, he preferred to loot their rearguards. Even the ability to survive against the much larger Ottoman army marks him as a master of Fabian tactics. Tahmasp knew that he could not replace his father as a charismatic spiritual leader, and while he struggled to restore his family&#x27;s legitimacy amongst the Qizilbash, he also had to craft a public figure of himself to convince the wider population of his right to rule as the new Safavid shah. Thus, he became a devout follower of Shi&#x27;ism and maintained this image with exaggerated piety until the end of his reign. This zealous image helped him to break the influence of the Qizilbash, and he became able to take the reins of power within ten years, after the realm had been through the civil war between the plotting tribal chieftains. He thus established a standard public image for Safavid kings: a zealous monarch who functioned as a representative of the Hidden Imam. However, none of his successors kept this image as zealously as him. Even after consolidating his power, Tahmasp had little political leverage compared to the Ottoman Empire. However, he successfully laid the foundation for Abbas the Great&#x27;s transformation of the Safavid polity by bringing Caucasian slaves into his realm. He thus created the core of the force that changed the political balance of the empire in his grandson&#x27;s time.

Tahmasp I made little impression on Western historians, who often compared him with his father. He is portrayed as a &quot;miser&quot; and a &quot;religious bigot&quot;. He was accused of never leaving the harem and it was said that he divided his time between sexual liaisons with his favourites and foretelling the future. This characterisation has made an obscure figure out of Tahmasp as a king and a person. However, there are several instances recorded by the contemporary historians which denoted the more favourable sides of the shah&#x27;s character: the fact that, despite his greed, piety led him to forgo taxes of about 30,000 tomans because collecting them would offend the religious law; his speech to the envoys of Suleiman the Magnificent, who had come to collect the fugitive Şehzade Bayezid, showed his political skill; he patronised the arts and had a highly cultured mind. According to Colin P. Mitchell, it is an achievement that he was able to not only maintain his father&#x27;s empire from dissolution but also expanded it whilst being contemporaneous with Suleiman the Magnificent, the most successful Ottoman sultan. It was during Tahmasp&#x27;s reign that the Safavid right to rule was established and gradually accepted among the Shia people, who were endeared to the idea of a descendent of (Family of the prophet of Islam, Muhammad) ruling over them. Thus the Safavid dynasty gained an ideological underpinning much stronger than the initial premise of the right of conquest. By the end of his reign, Tahmasp&#x27;s success in keeping the empire together allowed the Persian elite of the bureaucracy to assume bureaucratic and ideological custodianship of the Safavid empire. This allowed Tahmasp and his successors to gain dynastic legitimacy and to cultivate an imperial cult of personality that prevented another civil war, even when the empire was at its most fragile position.

<text>St. Jerome&#x27;s University (commonly shortened to St. Jerome&#x27;s or SJU) is a public Roman Catholic university in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is federated with the University of Waterloo. St. Jerome&#x27;s, within the University of Waterloo, combines academics and a residence. Students may both reside at and take classes through St. Jerome&#x27;s, live at SJU in residence but take classes elsewhere, or live in another residence but take classes at St. Jerome&#x27;s.

==History==

===Nineteenth century===
Reverend Dr. Louis Funcken and his brother, Friar Eugene Funcken – both Fathers of the Resurrectionist Congregation – founded St. Jerome&#x27;s College in 1865. Originally a log cabin school house on Erb&#x27;s Road in St. Agatha, the school moved to Duke Street in Berlin in 1867. The building was rebuilt and renovated several times, in 1881, 1889, 1907 and 1958. The school is the oldest post-secondary institution in the community. Originally founded to serve German Roman Catholics in Waterloo County, the school initially offered only two courses of study: a four year academic program designed to prepare students for professional studies or for the priesthood, and a two-year commercial program teaching Catholic business.

===Twentieth century===
In 1937 Joseph Francis Ryan, a St. Jerome&#x27;s College alumnus, was consecrated as Bishop of Hamilton, a diocese which included both Kitchener and Waterloo. Ryan pushed for the establishment of a Catholic liberal arts university within the diocese. In 1943, Ryan began a fund-raising campaign to finance the development of SJC, intending to bring it to university status. Ryan explained: &quot;In the postwar years, St. Jerome&#x27;s is planning a program of expansion which will bring her to the status which is her destiny as the Catholic College of the Diocese of Hamilton... As soon as conditions warrant after Victory, St. Jerome&#x27;s, through an expansion program, will offer courses with university recognition.&quot; Local businesses sponsored full-page advertisements supporting SJC&#x27;s efforts to become a university. By the end of 1948, fundraising contributions exceeded $2 million (). Ryan pledged only $250,000 of the funds, holding the rest until the initiation of the college&#x27;s building project.

On 20 February 1947 the SJC Board of Governors approved the purchase of property at Centreville (later Kingsdale) on the eastern boundary of Kitchener. SJC initially considered making an affiliation with Western University. For unclear reasons these plans were not followed up on. 

Carleton University became another option, although SJC President, Father Weiler, preferred the University of Ottawa. In April 1947 the Senate of the University of Ottawa agreed to affiliate with SJC. In 1948, SJC started offering a university arts program and began admitting women. By 1949 SJC announced plans to expand, anticipating construction the following year of a residence building and a building for administration and teaching. Construction began on the Kingsdale campus in September 1952 and was completed in 1953. Ontario Premier Leslie Frost attended the opening of the college&#x27;s arts building and library on 7 September 1953. The same day SJC outlined plans for future science and business faculties. Father Cornelius Siegfried was appointed rector of SJC the same year.

In 1953, Gerald Hagey, a Lutheran, complained that &quot;[it was] unfortunate for me, that when I became President of Waterloo College, St. Jerome&#x27;s was so far ahead of the Lutherans with its building program&quot;, and later recalled, &quot;some of the Protestant people [were complaining that] it was a shame Waterloo [College] had let St. Jerome&#x27;s get ahead of them.&quot;

Due to its denominational status as a Catholic institution, SJC was ineligible for provincial funding. To get around this, a new organization called the Waterloo College Associate Faculties was founded in 1955. The board consisted of prominent businessmen from Kitchener and Waterloo, including Ira Needles, industrialist Henry C. Krug and &quot;Kitchener-Waterloo Record&quot; editor John E. Motz. In 1956, the Canada Synod of the Lutheran Church agreed to an affiliation agreement of the Associate Faculties with Waterloo College. Siegfried agreed to the same proposal the next day. On the advice of his minister for education, W. J. Dunlop, Premier Frost granted university status to SJC in March 1959. That same month Waterloo North MPP John Wintermeyer introduced a private member&#x27;s bill in Ontario&#x27;s Legislative Assembly establishing the University of SJC, the University of Waterloo and Waterloo Lutheran University. After four years of negotiations SJC and Waterloo College federated with the University of Waterloo on 1 July 1960.

In January 1959, the SJC board of governors voted to purchase 55 acres of land north of Waterloo College&#x27;s campus, bordered by Columbia Street. The purchase was suspended in June when the University of Waterloo provided SJC with land on their 200-acre campus. A new SJC building was built on the Waterloo campus in 1960. The original Duke Street location became known as SJC High School while the University of Waterloo affiliate became the University of St. Jerome&#x27;s College. SJC High School closed in 1990.

In 1993, the men&#x27;s residence building was named after Father John Finn, the dean and registrar in 1960.

In 1998 St. Jerome&#x27;s College changed its name to St. Jerome&#x27;s University.

===Twenty-first century===
In April 2015 construction began on a $47 million campus project, adding a seven-storey student residence and a two-storey academic building.

==Programs==

St. Jerome&#x27;s University offers undergraduate courses in the faculties of Arts, in 12 scholastic disciplines, and in 4 interdisciplinary areas (Italian Studies, Legal Studies, Medieval Studies, and Sexuality, Marriage, and Family Studies). St. Jerome&#x27;s has a &quot;Master of Catholic Thought&quot; program aimed primarily at Catholic social leaders. In 2008, the St. Jerome&#x27;s Centre for Responsible Citizenship was launched to support community-based learning, international service learning, community development research, and public education. Beyond Borders is the name of the international service learning program at SJU.

==Scholarships and bursaries==

The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. St. Jerome&#x27;s University scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Sundance Aboriginal Student Award

<doc id="535239" wikidata="Q2564225" url="?curid=535239" title="History of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>The Ottoman Empire was founded c. 1299 by Osman I as a small beylik in northwestern Asia Minor just south of the Byzantine capital Constantinople. In 1326, the Ottomans captured nearby Bursa, cutting off Asia Minor from Byzantine control. The Ottomans first crossed into Europe in 1352, establishing a permanent settlement at Çimpe Castle on the Dardanelles in 1354 and moving their capital to Edirne (Adrianople) in 1369. At the same time, the numerous small Turkic states in Asia Minor were assimilated into the budding Ottoman sultanate through conquest or declarations of allegiance.

As Sultan Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (today named Istanbul) in 1453, transforming it into the new Ottoman capital, the state grew into a substantial empire, expanding deep into Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. With most of the Balkans under Ottoman rule by the mid-16th century, Ottoman territory increased exponentially under Sultan Selim I, who assumed the Caliphate in 1517 as the Ottomans turned east and conquered western Arabia, Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Levant, among other territories. Within the next few decades, much of the North African coast (except Morocco) became part of the Ottoman realm.

The empire reached its apex under Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century, when it stretched from the Persian Gulf in the east to Algeria in the west, and from Yemen in the south to Hungary and parts of Ukraine in the north. According to the Ottoman decline thesis, Suleiman&#x27;s reign was the zenith of the Ottoman classical period, during which Ottoman culture, arts, and political influence flourished. The empire reached its maximum territorial extent in 1683, on the eve of the Battle of Vienna.

From 1699 onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to lose territory over the course of the next two centuries due to internal stagnation, costly defensive wars, European colonialism, and nationalist revolts among its multiethnic subjects. In any case, the need to modernise was evident to the empire&#x27;s leaders by the early 19th century, and numerous administrative reforms were implemented in an attempt to forestall the decline of the empire, with varying degrees of success. The gradual weakening of the Ottoman Empire gave rise to the Eastern Question in the mid-19th century.

The empire came to an end in the aftermath of its defeat in World War I, when its remaining territory was partitioned by the Allies. The sultanate was officially abolished by the Government of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ankara on 1 November 1922 following the Turkish War of Independence. Throughout its more than 600 years of existence, the Ottoman Empire has left a profound legacy in the Middle East and Southeast Europe, as can be seen in the customs, culture, and cuisine of the various countries that were once part of its realm.

== Ottoman etiology ==
With the end of the First World War and the Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, questions arose in a geopolitical and historical context about the reasons for the emergence and decline of the Ottomans, the reasons for the emergence and decline of their empire and how both events were defined. On the eve of World War II, the geographical position and the geopolitical weight of Turkey, the major historical heir to the Ottoman Empire, gave weight to the issues as propaganda. The first item on the agenda of the Tehran conference was the issue of Turkey&#x27;s participation in World War II by the end of 1943.

== Formulable theses ==
=== Those about the emergence of the Ottoman Empire ===

# Ghaza thesis — it is formulated first, but it is the most criticized and politicized. The thesis most clearly advocates the ethnic pan-Turkic principle. It was developed by Paul Wittek;
# Renegade thesis — represented in studies, articles and books by various authors. It is based on numerous eyewitness accounts. It is supplemented by the hypothesis of the geographical and to some extent civilizational succession of the Ottoman Empire (Rûm) by the Eastern Roman Empire;
# Socio-economic thesis — the newest and most modern, sustained in the traditions of Marxist historiography. The thesis is found in various articles and studies. It is based on the aftermath of the Black Death and the legacy of the Byzantine civil wars.

=== Those about the decline of the Ottoman Empire ===
# Classic thesis — as a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) with the subsequent Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Previously marked by the beginning of the reign of Catherine the Great, the writing of &quot;Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya&quot; and the death of Koca Ragıp Pasha;
# Ottoman decline thesis — now-controversial thesis clearly formulated for the first time in 1958 by Bernard Lewis. Aligns with Koçi Bey&#x27;s risalets, but arguably ignores the Köprülü era and its reform of the Ottoman state, economy and navy heading into the 18th century;
# Neoclassical thesis — to some extent it unites the previous ones about the beginning of the Ottoman decline, which are divided even nearly two centuries in time. The beginning of the end was marked by the Treaty of Karlowitz, the Edirne event and the reign of Ahmed III.

==Rise of the Ottoman Empire (1299–1453)==

With the demise of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum during 12th to 13th century, Anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent states, the so-called Anatolian Beyliks. For the next few decades, these Beyliks were under the sovereignty of Mongolians and their Iranian Kingdom Ilkhanids. By 1300, a weakened Byzantine Empire had lost most of its Anatolian provinces to these Turkish principalities. One of the beyliks was led by Osman I (d. 1323/4), from which the name Ottoman is derived, son of Ertuğrul, around Eskişehir in western Anatolia. In the foundation myth expressed in the story known as &quot;Osman&#x27;s Dream&quot;, the young Osman was inspired to conquest by a prescient vision of empire (according to his dream, the empire is a big tree whose roots spread through three continents and whose branches cover the sky). According to his dream the tree, which was Osman&#x27;s Empire, issued four rivers from its roots, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Nile and the Danube. Additionally, the tree shaded four mountain ranges, the Caucasus, the Taurus, the Atlas and the Balkan ranges. During his reign as Sultan, Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the Byzantine Empire.

During this period, a formal Ottoman government was created whose institutions would change drastically over the life of the empire.

In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. Osman&#x27;s son, Orhan, captured the city of Bursa in 1326 and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. The fall of Bursa meant the loss of Byzantine control over Northwestern Anatolia.

After securing their flank in Asia Minor, the Ottomans then crossed into Europe from 1352 onwards; within a decade, almost all of Thrace had been conquered by the Ottomans, cutting off Constantinople from its Balkan hinterlands. The Ottoman capital was moved to Adrianople Edirne in 1369. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks. With the extension of Turkish dominion into the Balkans, the strategic conquest of Constantinople became a crucial objective. The Empire controlled nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when Timur invaded Anatolia in the Battle of Ankara in 1402. He took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner. The capture of Bayezid I threw the Turks into disorder. The state fell into a civil war that lasted from 1402 to 1413, as Bayezid&#x27;s sons fought over succession. It ended when Mehmed I emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power, bringing an end to the Interregnum.

Part of the Ottoman territories in the Balkans (such as Thessaloniki, Macedonia and Kosovo) were temporarily lost after 1402, but were later recovered by Murad II between the 1430s and 1450s. On 10 November 1444, Murad II defeated the Hungarian, Polish and Wallachian armies under Władysław III of Poland (also King of Hungary) and János Hunyadi at the Battle of Varna, which was the final battle of the Crusade of Varna. Four years later, János Hunyadi prepared another army (of Hungarian and Wallachian forces) to attack the Turks, but was again defeated by Murad II at the Second Battle of Kosovo in 1448.

The son of Murad II, Mehmed the Conqueror, reorganized the state and the military, and demonstrated his martial prowess by capturing Constantinople on 29 May 1453, at the age of 21.

==Classical Age (1453–1566)==


The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by Mehmed II cemented the status of the Empire as the preeminent power in southeastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean. After taking Constantinople, Mehmed met with the Orthodox patriarch, Gennadios and worked out an arrangement in which the Eastern Orthodox Church, in exchange for being able to maintain its autonomy and land, accepted Ottoman authority. Because of bad relations between the latter Byzantine Empire and the states of western Europe as epitomized by Loukas Notaras&#x27;s famous remark &quot;Better the Sultan&#x27;s turban than the Cardinal&#x27;s Hat&quot;, the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as preferable to Venetian rule.

Upon making Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) the new capital of the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed II assumed the title of &quot;Kayser-i Rûm&quot; (literally &quot;Caesar Romanus&quot;, i.e. Roman Emperor.) In order to consolidate this claim, he would launch a campaign to conquer Rome, the western capital of the former Roman Empire. To this aim he spent many years securing positions on the Adriatic Sea, such as in Albania Veneta, and then continued with the Ottoman invasion of Otranto and Apulia on 28 July 1480. The Turks stayed in Otranto and its surrounding areas for nearly a year, but after Mehmed II&#x27;s death on 3 May 1481, plans for penetrating deeper into the Italian peninsula with fresh new reinforcements were given up on and cancelled and the remaining Ottoman troops sailed back to the east of the Adriatic Sea.


During this period in the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottoman Empire entered a long period of conquest and expansion, extending its borders deep into Europe and North Africa. Conquests on land were driven by the discipline and innovation of the Ottoman military; and on the sea, the Ottoman Navy aided this expansion significantly. The navy also contested and protected key seagoing trade routes, in competition with the Italian city states in the Black, Aegean and Mediterranean seas and the Portuguese in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.

The state also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia.

The Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective Sultans. Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) dramatically expanded the Empire&#x27;s eastern and southern frontiers by defeating Shah Ismail I of Safavid Persia, in 1514 at the Battle of Chaldiran. Selim I established Ottoman rule in Egypt, and created a naval presence on the Red Sea. After this Ottoman expansion, a competition started between the Portuguese Empire and the Ottoman Empire to become the dominant power in the region. This conquest ended with the execution of Tuman Bay II.

Selim&#x27;s successor, Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566), further expanded upon Selim&#x27;s conquests. After capturing Belgrade in 1521, Suleiman conquered the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Hungary (the western, northern and northeastern parts remained independent).


After his victory in the Battle of Mohács in 1526, he established Turkish rule in the territory of present-day Hungary (except the western region) and other Central European territories, (See also: Ottoman–Hungarian Wars). He then laid siege to Vienna in 1529, but failed to take the city after the onset of winter forced his retreat.

In 1532, he made another attack on Vienna, but was repulsed in the Siege of Güns, south of the city at the fortress of Güns. In the other version of the story, the city&#x27;s commander, Nikola Jurišić, was offered terms for a nominal surrender. However, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains and did not continue towards Vienna as previously planned, but turned homeward instead.

After further advances by the Turks in 1543, the Habsburg ruler Ferdinand officially recognized Ottoman ascendancy in Hungary in 1547. During the reign of Suleiman, Transylvania, Wallachia and, intermittently, Moldavia, became tributary principalities of the Ottoman Empire. In the east, the Ottoman Turks took Baghdad from the Persians in 1535, gaining control of Mesopotamia and naval access to the Persian Gulf. By the end of Suleiman&#x27;s reign, the Empire&#x27;s population totaled about 15,000,000 people.

Under Selim and Suleiman the Magnificent, the Empire became a dominant naval force, controlling much of the Mediterranean. The exploits of the Ottoman admiral Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha, who commanded the Ottoman Navy during Suleiman&#x27;s reign, led to a number of military victories over Christian navies. Important naval victories of the Ottoman Empire in this period include the Battle of Preveza (1538); Battle of Ponza (1552); Battle of Djerba (1560); conquest of Algiers (in 1516 and 1529) and Tunis (in 1534 and 1574) from Spain; conquest of Rhodes (1522) and Tripoli (1551) from the Knights of St. John; capture of Nice (1543) from the Holy Roman Empire; capture of Corsica (1553) from the Republic of Genoa; capture of the Balearic Islands (1558) from Spain; capture of Aden (1548), Muscat (1552) and Aceh (1565–67) from Portugal during the Indian Ocean expeditions; among others.

The conquests of Nice (1543) and Corsica (1553) occurred on behalf of France as a joint venture between the forces of the French king Francis I and the Ottoman sultan Suleiman I, and were commanded by the Ottoman admirals Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha and Turgut Reis. A month prior to the siege of Nice, France supported the Ottomans with an artillery unit during the Ottoman conquest of Esztergom in 1543. France and the Ottoman Empire, united by mutual opposition to Habsburg rule in both Southern and Central Europe, became strong allies during this period. The alliance was economic and military, as the sultans granted France the right of trade within the Empire without levy of taxation. By this time, the Ottoman Empire was a significant and accepted part of the European political sphere. It made a military alliance with France, the Kingdom of England and the Dutch Republic against Habsburg Spain, Italy and Habsburg Austria.

Suleiman I&#x27;s policy of expansion throughout the Mediterranean basin was however halted in Malta in 1565. During a summer-long siege which was later to be known as the Siege of Malta, the Ottoman forces which numbered around 50,000 fought the Knights of St. John and the Maltese garrison of 6000 men. Stubborn resistance by the Maltese led to the lifting of the siege in September. The unsuccessful siege (the Turks managed to capture the Isle of Gozo together with Fort Saint Elmo on the main island of Malta, but failed elsewhere and retreated) was the second and last defeat experienced by Suleiman the Magnificent after the likewise inconclusive first Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1529. Suleiman I died of natural causes in his tent during the Siege of Szigetvár in 1566. The Battle of Lepanto in 1571 (which was triggered by the Ottoman capture of Venetian-controlled Cyprus in 1570) was another major setback for Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, despite the fact that an equally large Ottoman fleet was built in a short time and Tunisia was recovered from Spain in 1574.

As the 16th century progressed, Ottoman naval superiority was challenged by the growing sea powers of western Europe, particularly Portugal, in the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean and the Spice Islands. With the Ottoman Turks blockading sea-lanes to the East and South, the European powers were driven to find another way to the ancient silk and spice routes, now under Ottoman control. On land, the Empire was preoccupied by military campaigns in Austria and Persia, two widely separated theatres of war. The strain of these conflicts on the Empire&#x27;s resources, and the logistics of maintaining lines of supply and communication across such vast distances, ultimately rendered its sea efforts unsustainable and unsuccessful. The overriding military need for defence on the western and eastern frontiers of the Empire eventually made effective long-term engagement on a global scale impossible.

==Transformation of the Ottoman Empire (1566–1700)==

European states initiated efforts at this time to curb Ottoman control of the traditional overland trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe, which started with the Silk Road. Western European states began to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly by establishing their own maritime routes to Asia through new discoveries at sea. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman–Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. Economically, the Price Revolution caused rampant inflation in both Europe and the Middle East. This had serious negative consequences at all levels of Ottoman society.

The expansion of Muscovite Russia under Ivan IV (1533–1584) into the Volga and Caspian region at the expense of the Tatar khanates disrupted the northern pilgrimage and trade routes. A highly ambitious plan to counter this conceived by Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, Grand Vizier under Selim II, in the shape of a Don-Volga canal (begun June 1569), combined with an attack on Astrakhan, failed, the canal being abandoned with the onset of winter. Henceforth the Empire returned to its existing strategy of utilizing the Crimean Khanate as its bulwark against Russia. In 1571, the Crimean khan Devlet I Giray, supported by the Ottomans, burned Moscow. The next year, the invasion was repeated but repelled at the Battle of Molodi. The Crimean Khanate continued to invade Eastern Europe in a series of slave raids, and remained a significant power in Eastern Europe and a threat to Muscovite Russia in particular until the end of the 17th century.

In southern Europe, a coalition of Catholic powers, led by Philip II of Spain, formed an alliance to challenge Ottoman naval strength in the Mediterranean. Their victory over the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto (1571) was a startling blow to the image of Ottoman invincibility. However, historians today stress the symbolic and not the strictly military significance of the battle, for within six months of the defeat a new Ottoman fleet of some 250 sail including eight modern galleasses had been built, with the shipyards of Istanbul turning out a new ship every day at the height of the construction. In discussions with a Venetian minister, the Ottoman Grand Vizier commented: &quot;In capturing Cyprus from you, we have cut off one of your arms; in defeating our fleet you have merely shaved off our beard&quot;. The Ottoman naval recovery persuaded Venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573, and the Ottomans were able to expand and consolidate their position in North Africa. However, what could not be replaced were the experienced naval officers and sailors. The Battle of Lepanto was far more damaging to the Ottoman navy in sapping experienced manpower than the loss of ships, which were rapidly replaced.

By contrast, the Habsburg frontier had settled into a reasonably permanent border, marked only by relatively minor battles concentrating on the possession of individual fortresses. The stalemate was caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences and reflected simple geographical limits: in the pre-mechanized age, Vienna marked the furthest point that an Ottoman army could march from Istanbul during the early spring to late autumn campaigning season. It also reflected the difficulties imposed on the Empire by the need to support two separate fronts: one against the Austrians (see: Ottoman wars in Europe), and the other against a rival Islamic state, the Safavids of Persia (see: Ottoman wars in Near East).
Changes in European military tactics and weaponry in the military revolution caused the Sipahi cavalry to lose military relevance. The Long War against Austria (1593–1606) created the need for greater numbers of infantry equipped with firearms. This resulted in a relaxation of recruitment policy and a significant growth in Janissary corps numbers. Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited for the same reasons and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts (1595–1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With the Empire&#x27;s population reaching 30,000,000 people by 1600, shortage of land placed further pressure on the government.


However, the 17th century was not an era of stagnation and decline, but a key period in which the Ottoman state and its structures began to adapt to new pressures and new realities, internal and external. The Sultanate of women (1534–1683) was a period in which the political influence of the Imperial Harem was dominant, as the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons. This was not wholly unprecedented; Hürrem Sultan, who established herself in the early 1530s as the successor of Hafsa, the first valide sultan, was described by the Venetian baylo Andrea Giritti as &quot;a woman of the utmost goodness, courage and wisdom&quot; even though she &quot;thwarted some while rewarding others&quot;. But the inadequacy of Ibrahim I (1640–1648) and the minority accession of Mehmed IV in 1646 created a significant crisis of rule, which the dominant women of the Imperial Harem filled. The most prominent women of this period were Kösem Sultan and her daughter-in-law Turhan Hatice, whose political rivalry culminated in Kösem&#x27;s murder in 1651.


This period gave way to the highly significant Köprülü Era (1656–1703), during which effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of Grand Viziers from the Köprülü family. On 15 September 1656 the octogenarian Köprülü Mehmed Pasha accepted the seals of office having received guarantees from the Valide Turhan Hatice of unprecedented authority and freedom from interference. A fierce conservative disciplinarian, he successfully reasserted the central authority and the empire&#x27;s military impetus. This continued under his son and successor Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed (Grand Vizier 1661–1676). The Köprülü Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in Transylvania, the conquest of Crete completed in 1669 and expansion into Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn and Kamianets-Podilskyi and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.

This period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end when Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha in May 1683 led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of Vienna in the Great Turkish War of 1683–1699. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king Jan at the
Battle of Vienna.

The alliance of the Holy League pressed home the advantage of the defeat at Vienna and, thus, fifteen (15) years of see-sawing warfare, culminated in the epochal Treaty of Karlowitz (26 January 1699), which ended the Great Turkish War. For the first time, the Ottoman Empire surrendered control of significant European territories (many permanently), including Ottoman Hungary. The Empire had reached the end of its ability to effectively conduct an assertive, expansionist policy against its European rivals and it was to be forced from this point to adopt an essentially defensive strategy within this theatre.

Only two Sultans in this period personally exercised strong political and military control of the Empire: the vigorous Murad IV (1612–1640) recaptured Yerevan (1635) and Baghdad (1639) from the Safavids and reasserted central authority, albeit during a brief majority reign. Mustafa II (1695–1703) led the Ottoman counterattack of 1695–96 against the Habsburgs in Hungary, but was undone at the disastrous defeat at Zenta (11 September 1697).

==Stagnation and reform (1700–1827)==
During this period threats to the Ottoman Empire were presented by the traditional foe—the Austrian Empire—as well as by a new foe—the rising Russian Empire. Certain areas of the Empire, such as Egypt and Algeria, became independent in all but name, and later came under the influence of Britain and France. Later, in the 18th century, centralized authority within the Ottoman Empire gave way to varying degrees of provincial autonomy enjoyed by local governors and leaders.

However, Russian expansion presented a large and growing threat. Accordingly, King Charles XII of Sweden was welcomed as an ally in the Ottoman Empire following his defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 (part of the Great Northern War of 1700–1721.) Charles XII persuaded the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III to declare war on Russia, which resulted in the Ottoman victory at the Pruth River Campaign of 1710–1711. Following the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718), the subsequent Treaty of Passarowitz signed on 21 July 1718, brought a period of peace between wars. However, the Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe.

During the Tulip Era (1718–1730), named for Sultan Ahmed III&#x27;s love of the tulip flower and its use to symbolize his peaceful reign, the Empire&#x27;s policy towards Europe underwent a shift. The Empire began to improve the fortifications of its cities in the Balkan peninsula to act as a defence against European expansionism. Cultural works, fine arts and architecture flourished, with more elaborate styles that were influenced by the Baroque and Rococo movements in Europe. A classic example is the Fountain of Ahmed III in front of the Topkapı Palace. The famous Flemish-French painter Jean-Baptiste van Mour visited the Ottoman Empire during the Tulip Era and crafted some of the most renowned works of art depicting scenes from daily life in the Ottoman society and the imperial court.

Upon the death of Peter the Great in 1725, Catherine, Peter&#x27;s wife succeeded to the throne of the Russian Empire as Czarina Catherine I. Together with Austria, Russia, under Empress Anne, Catherine I&#x27;s niece, engaged in a war against the Ottoman Empire from 1735 until 1739. The Treaty of Belgrade signed on 18 September 1739, ended this war and resulted in Ottoman recovery of Belgrade and other territories from Austria, but the loss of the port of Azov to the Russians. However following the Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of the Prussians under King Frederick the Great.

This long period of Ottoman peace and, indeed, stagnation is typically characterized by historians as an era of failed reforms. In the latter part of this period there were educational and technological reforms, including the establishment of higher education institutions such as the Istanbul Technical University. Ottoman science and technology had been highly regarded in medieval times, as a result of Ottoman scholars&#x27; synthesis of classical learning with Islamic philosophy and mathematics, and knowledge of such Chinese advances in technology as gunpowder and the magnetic compass. By this period, though, the influences had become regressive and conservative. In 1734, when an artillery school was established with French teachers in order to impart Western-style artillery methods, the Islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of theodicy. Not until 1754 was the artillery school reopened on a semi-secret basis. Earlier, the guilds of writers had denounced the printing press as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s Invention&quot;, and were responsible for a 53-year lag between its invention by Johannes Gutenberg in Europe in c. 1440 and its introduction to the Ottoman society with the first Gutenberg press in Istanbul that was established by the Sephardic Jews of Spain in 1493 (who had migrated to the Ottoman Empire a year earlier, escaping from the Spanish Inquisition of 1492.) However, the printing press was used only by the non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire until the 18th century. In 1726, Ibrahim Muteferrika convinced the Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha, the Grand Mufti, and the clergy on the efficiency of the printing press, and later submitted a request to Sultan Ahmed III, who granted Muteferrika the permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some calligraphers and religious leaders.) Muteferrika&#x27;s press published its first book in 1729, and, by 1743, issued 17 works in 23 volumes (each having between 500 and 1,000 copies.)

Other tentative reforms were also enacted: taxes were lowered, there were attempts to improve the image of the Ottoman state, and the first instances of private investment and entrepreneurship occurred.

Following the period of peace, which had lasted since 1739, Russia began to assert its expansionistic desires again in 1768. Under the pretext of pursuing fugitive Polish revolutionaries, Russian troops entered Balta an Ottoman-controlled city on the border of Bessarabia and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground. This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), during which, in January 1769, a 70-thousand Turkish-Tatar army led by the Crimean Khan Qırım Giray made one of the largest slave raids in the history, which was repulsed by the 6-thousand garrison of the Fortress of St. Elizabeth, which prevented Ottoman Empire from further progress. After that, the Ottomans were pushed back to the shores of the Black Sea by the troops of General Rumyantsev. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774 ended the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774) and allowed that the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled Rumanian provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia would be allowed freedom to worship. Russia was made the guarantor of their right to Christian worship.

A series of wars were fought between the Russian and Ottoman empires from the 18th to the 19th century. By the late 18th century, a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of Peter the Great had given the Russians an edge, and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats.

Ottoman military reform efforts begin with Selim III (1789–1807) who made the first major attempts to modernize the army along European lines. These efforts, however, were hampered by reactionary movements, partly from the religious leadership, but primarily from the Janissary corps, who had become anarchic and ineffectual. Jealous of their privileges and firmly opposed to change, they created a Janissary revolt. Selim&#x27;s efforts cost him his throne and his life, but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor, the dynamic Mahmud II, who eliminated the Janissary corps in 1826.
The Serbian revolution (1804–1815) marked the beginning of an era of national awakening in the Balkans during the Eastern Question. Suzerainty of Serbia as a hereditary monarchy under its own dynasty was acknowledged &quot;de jure&quot; in 1830. In 1821, the Greeks declared war on the Sultan. A rebellion that originated in Moldavia as a diversion was followed by the main revolution in the Peloponnese, which, along with the northern part of the Gulf of Corinth, became the first parts of the Ottoman empire to achieve independence (in 1829). By the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the &quot;sick man&quot; by Europeans. The suzerain states – the Principality of Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia and Montenegro – moved towards &quot;de jure&quot; independence during the 1860s and 1870s.

==Decline and modernization (1828–1908)==

During this period, the empire faced challenges in defending itself against foreign invasion and occupation. The empire ceased to enter conflicts on its own and began to forge alliances with European countries such as France, the Netherlands, Britain and Russia. As an example, in the 1853 Crimean War, the Ottomans united with Britain, France and the Kingdom of Sardinia against Russia.

===Modernization===

During the Tanzimat period (from Arabic: تنظيم &quot;tanẓīm&quot;, meaning &quot;organisation&quot;) (1839–76), the government&#x27;s series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law and guilds with modern factories. In 1856, the &quot;Hatt-ı Hümayun&quot; promised equality for all Ottoman citizens regardless of their ethnicity and religious confession; which thus widened the scope of the 1839 &quot;Hatt-ı Şerif&quot; of Gülhane.

Overall, the Tanzimat reforms had far-reaching effects. Those educated in the schools established during the Tanzimat period included Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and other progressive leaders and thinkers of the Republic of Turkey and of many other former Ottoman states in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa. These reforms included guarantees to ensure the Ottoman subjects perfect security for their lives, honour and property; the introduction of the first Ottoman paper banknotes (1840) and opening of the first post offices (1840); the reorganisation of the finance system according to the French model (1840); the reorganisation of the Civil and Criminal Code according to the French model (1840); the establishment of the &quot;Meclis-i Maarif-i Umumiye&quot; (1841) which was the prototype of the First Ottoman Parliament (1876); the reorganisation of the army and a regular method of recruiting, levying the army and fixing the duration of military service (1843–44); the adoption of an Ottoman national anthem and Ottoman national flag (1844); the first nationwide Ottoman census in 1844 (only male citizens were counted); the first national identity cards (officially named the &quot;Mecidiye&quot; identity papers, or informally &quot;kafa kağıdı&quot; (&quot;head paper&quot;) documents, 1844); the institution of a Council of Public Instruction (1845) and the Ministry of Education (&quot;Mekatib-i Umumiye Nezareti&quot;, 1847, which later became the &quot;Maarif Nezareti&quot;, 1857); the abolition of slavery and slave trade (1847); the establishment of the first modern universities (&quot;darülfünun&quot;, 1848), academies (1848) and teacher schools (&quot;darülmuallimin&quot;, 1848); establishment of the Ministry of Healthcare (&quot;Tıbbiye Nezareti&quot;, 1850); the Commerce and Trade Code (1850); establishment of the Academy of Sciences (&quot;Encümen-i Daniş&quot;, 1851); establishment of the &quot;Şirket-i Hayriye&quot; which operated the first steam-powered commuter ferries (1851); the first European style courts (&quot;Meclis-i Ahkam-ı Adliye&quot;, 1853) and supreme judiciary council (&quot;Meclis-i Ali-yi Tanzimat&quot;, 1853); establishment of the modern Municipality of Istanbul (&quot;Şehremaneti&quot;, 1854) and the City Planning Council (&quot;İntizam-ı Şehir Komisyonu&quot;, 1855); the abolition of the capitation (Jizya) tax on non-Muslims, with a regular method of establishing and collecting taxes (1856); non-Muslims were allowed to become soldiers (1856); various provisions for the better administration of the public service and advancement of commerce; the establishment of the first telegraph networks (1847–1855) and railways (1856); the replacement of guilds with factories; the establishment of the Ottoman Central Bank (originally established as the &quot;Bank-ı Osmanî&quot; in 1856, and later reorganised as the &quot;Bank-ı Osmanî-i Şahane&quot; in 1863) and the Ottoman Stock Exchange (&quot;Dersaadet Tahvilat Borsası&quot;, established in 1866); the Land Code (&quot;Arazi Kanunnamesi&quot;, 1857); permission for private sector publishers and printing firms with the &quot;Serbesti-i Kürşad Nizamnamesi&quot; (1857); establishment of the School of Economical and Political Sciences (&quot;Mekteb-i Mülkiye&quot;, 1859); the Press and Journalism Regulation Code (&quot;Matbuat Nizamnamesi&quot;, 1864); among others.
The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul on 23 October 1840. The first post office was the &quot;Postahane-i Amire&quot; near the courtyard of the Yeni Mosque. In 1876 the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the vast Ottoman Empire was established. In 1901 the first money transfers were made through the post offices and the first cargo services became operational.

Samuel Morse received his first ever patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present Beylerbeyi Palace was built in 1861–1865 on the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan Abdülmecid who personally tested the new invention. Following this successful test, installation works of the first telegraph line (Istanbul-Adrianople–Şumnu) began on 9 August 1847. In 1855 the Ottoman telegraph network became operational and the Telegraph Administration was established. In 1871 the Ministry of Post and the Telegraph Administration were merged, becoming the Ministry of Post and Telegraph. In July 1881 the first telephone circuit in Istanbul was established between the Ministry of Post and Telegraph in the Soğukçeşme quarter and the Postahane-i Amire in the Yenicami quarter. On 23 May 1909, the first manual telephone exchange with a 50 line capacity entered service in the Büyük Postane (Grand Post Office) in Sirkeci.

The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the &quot;Kanûn-u Esâsî&quot; (meaning &quot;Basic Law&quot; in Ottoman Turkish), written by members of the Young Ottomans, which was promulgated on 23 November 1876. It established the freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law. The empire&#x27;s First Constitutional era, was short-lived. But the idea of Ottomanism proved influential. A group of reformers known as the Young Ottomans, primarily educated in Western universities, believed that a constitutional monarchy would give an answer to the empire&#x27;s growing social unrest. Through a military coup in 1876, they forced Sultan Abdülaziz (1861–1876) to abdicate in favour of Murad V. However, Murad V was mentally ill and was deposed within a few months. His heir-apparent, Abdülhamid II (1876–1909), was invited to assume power on the condition that he would declare a constitutional monarchy, which he did on 23 November 1876. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it. When forced to reconvene it, he abolished the representative body instead. This ended the effectiveness of the &quot;Kanûn-ı Esâsî&quot;.

The Christian millets gained privileges, such as in the Armenian National Constitution of 1863. This Divan-approved form of the &quot;Code of Regulations&quot; consisted of 150 articles drafted by the Armenian intelligentsia. Another institution was the newly formed Armenian National Assembly. The Christian population of the empire, owing to their higher educational levels, started to pull ahead of the Muslim majority, leading to much resentment on the part of the latter. In 1861, there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians with 140,000 pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the same time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology. In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy. In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks.

====Railways====
New railways were built during this period, including the first in the Ottoman Empire.

===Crimean War===

The Crimean War (1853–1856) was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the declining Ottoman Empire. Britain and France successfully defended the Ottoman Empire against Russia.

Most of the fighting took place when the allies landed on Russia&#x27;s Crimean Peninsula to gain control of the Black Sea. There were smaller campaigns in western Anatolia, the Caucasus, the Baltic Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the White Sea. It was one of the first &quot;modern&quot; wars, as it introduced new technologies to warfare, such as the first tactical use of railways and the telegraph. The subsequent Treaty of Paris (1856) secured Ottoman control over the Balkan Peninsula and the Black Sea basin. That lasted until defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878.

The Ottoman Empire took its first foreign loans on 4 August 1854, shortly after the beginning of the Crimean War.

The war caused an exodus of the Crimean Tatars. From the total Tatar population of 300,000 in the Tauride Province, about 200,000 Crimean Tatars moved to the Ottoman Empire in continuing waves of emigration. Toward the end of the Caucasian Wars, 90% of the Circassians were exiled from their homelands in the Caucasus and settled in the Ottoman Empire. Since the 19th century, the exodus to present-day Turkey by the large portion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans, Caucasus, Crimea and Crete, had great influence in molding the country&#x27;s fundamental features. These people were called &quot;Muhacir&quot; under a general definition. By the time the Ottoman Empire came to an end in 1922, half of the urban population of Turkey was descended from Muslim refugees from Russia. Crimean Tatar refugees in the late 19th century played an especially notable role in seeking to modernise Turkish education.

===Ethnic nationalism===
The rise of nationalism swept through many countries during the 19th century, and it affected territories within the Ottoman Empire. A burgeoning national consciousness, together with a growing sense of ethnic nationalism, made nationalistic thought one of the most significant Western ideas imported to the Ottoman Empire. It was forced to deal with nationalism both within and beyond its borders. The number of revolutionary political parties rose dramatically. Uprisings in Ottoman territory had many far-reaching consequences during the 19th century and determined much of Ottoman policy during the early 20th century. Many Ottoman Turks questioned whether the policies of the state were to blame: some felt that the sources of ethnic conflict were external, and unrelated to issues of governance. While this era was not without some successes, the ability of the Ottoman state to have any effect on ethnic uprisings was seriously called into question.

In 1804 the Serbian Revolution against Ottoman rule erupted in the Balkans, running in parallel with the Napoleonic invasion. By 1817, when the revolution ended, Serbia was raised to the status of self-governing monarchy under nominal Ottoman suzerainty. In 1821 the First Hellenic Republic became the first Balkan country to achieve its independence from the Ottoman Empire. It was officially recognised by the Porte in 1829, after the end of the Greek War of Independence.

===Balkans===

The Tanzimat reforms did not halt the rise of nationalism in the Danubian Principalities and the Principality of Serbia, which had been semi-independent for almost six decades. In 1875, the tributary principalities of Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, unilaterally declared their independence from the empire. Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the empire granted independence to all three belligerent nations. Bulgaria also achieved independence (as the Principality of Bulgaria); its volunteers had participated in the Russo-Turkish War on the side of the rebelling nations.

====Congress of Berlin====
The Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878) was a meeting of the leading statesmen of Europe&#x27;s Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire. In the wake of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) that ended with a decisive victory for Russia and her Orthodox Christian allies (subjects of the Ottoman Empire before the war) in the Balkan Peninsula, the urgent need was to stabilise and reorganise the Balkans, and set up new nations. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who led the Congress, undertook to adjust boundaries to minimise the risks of major war, while recognising the reduced power of the Ottomans, and balance the distinct interests of the great powers.

As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, but was not allowed to keep all its previous territory. Bulgaria lost Eastern Rumelia, which was restored to the Turks under a special administration; and Macedonia, which was returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform. Romania achieved full independence, but had to turn over part of Bessarabia to Russia. Serbia and Montenegro finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories.

In 1878, Austria-Hungary unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Novi Pazar, but the Ottoman government contested this move and maintained its troops in both provinces. The stalemate lasted for 30 years (Austrian and Ottoman forces coexisted in Bosnia and Novi Pazar for three decades) until 1908, when the Austrians took advantage of the political turmoil in the Ottoman Empire that stemmed from the Young Turk Revolution and annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina, but pulled their troops out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise and avoid a war with the Turks.

In return for British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s advocacy for restoring the Ottoman territories on the Balkan Peninsula during the Congress of Berlin, Britain assumed the administration of Cyprus in 1878 and later sent troops to Egypt in 1882 with the pretext of helping the Ottoman government to put down the Urabi Revolt; effectively gaining control in both territories (Britain formally annexed the still nominally Ottoman territories of Cyprus and Egypt on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s decision to enter World War I on the side of the Central Powers.) France, on its part, occupied Tunisia in 1881.

The results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilisation. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances regarding the results festered until they exploded into world war in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece made gains, but far less than they thought they deserved. The Ottoman Empire, called at the time the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;, was humiliated and significantly weakened, rendering it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated at Berlin, and resented its treatment. Austria gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred of Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria in the Balkans.

In the long-run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress succeeded in keeping Istanbul in Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia&#x27;s victory. The Congress of Berlin returned to the Ottoman Empire territories that the previous treaty had given to the Principality of Bulgaria, most notably Macedonia, thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria that in 1912 led to the First Balkan War in which the Turks were defeated and lost nearly all of Europe. As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the empire&#x27;s remaining territory in the Balkans or to the heartland in Anatolia. Muslims had been the majority in some parts of the Ottoman Empire such as the Crimea, the Balkans and the Caucasus as well as a plurality in southern Russia and also in some parts of Romania. Most of these lands were lost with time by the Ottoman Empire between the 19th and 20th centuries. By 1923, only Anatolia and eastern Thrace remained Muslim land.

===Egypt===

After gaining some amount of autonomy during the early 1800s, Egypt had entered into a period of political turmoil by the 1880s. In April 1882, British and French warships appeared in Alexandria to support the khedive and prevent the country from falling into the hands of anti-European nationals. In August 1882 British forces invaded and occupied Egypt on the pretext of bringing order. The British supported Khedive Tewfiq and restored stability with was especially beneficial to British and French financial interests. Egypt and Sudan remained as Ottoman provinces &quot;de jure&quot; until 1914, when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers of World War I. Great Britain officially annexed these two provinces and Cyprus in response. Other Ottoman provinces in North Africa were lost between 1830 and 1912, starting with Algeria (occupied by France in 1830), Tunisia (occupied by France in 1881) and Libya (occupied by Italy in 1912).

===Armenians===

Although granted their own constitution and national assembly with the Tanzimat reforms, the Armenians attempted to demand implementation of Article 61 from the Ottoman government as agreed upon at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Following pressure from the European powers and Armenians, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, in response, assigned the Hamidiye regiments to eastern Anatolia (Ottoman Armenia). These were formed mostly of irregular cavalry units of recruited Kurds. From 1894 to 1896, between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians living throughout the empire were killed in what became known as the Hamidian massacres. Armenian militants seized the Ottoman Bank headquarters in Istanbul in 1896 to bring European attention to the massacres, but they failed to gain any help.

== Defeat and dissolution (1908–1922) ==
The Ottoman Empire had long been the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; and after a series of Balkan wars by 1914 had been driven out of nearly all of Europe and North Africa. It still controlled 28 million people, of whom 17 million were in modern-day Turkey, 3 million in Syria, Lebanon, and 2.5 million in Iraq. Another 5.5 million people were under nominal Ottoman rule in the Arabian peninsula.

The Second Constitutional Era began after the Young Turk Revolution (3 July 1908) with the sultan&#x27;s announcement of the restoration of the 1876 constitution and the reconvening of the Ottoman Parliament. It marked the beginning of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. This era is dominated by the politics of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), and the movement that would become known as the Young Turks. Although it began as a uniting progressive party, the CUP splintered in 1911 with the founding of the opposition Freedom and Accord Party (Liberal Union or Entente), which poached many of the more liberal Deputies from the CUP. The remaining CUP members, who now took a more dominantly nationalist tone in the face of the enmity of the Balkan Wars, dueled Freedom and Accord in a series of power reversals, which ultimately led to the CUP (specifically its leadership, the &quot;Three Pashas&quot;) seizing power from the Freedom and Accord in the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;état and establishing total dominance over Ottoman politics until the end of World War I.

Profiting from the civil strife, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, but pulled its troops out of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, another contested region between the Austrians and Ottomans, to avoid a war. During the Italo-Turkish War (1911–12) in which the Ottoman Empire lost Libya, the Balkan League declared war against the Ottoman Empire. The Empire lost the Balkan Wars (1912–13). It lost its Balkan territories except East Thrace and the historic Ottoman capital city of Adrianople during the war. Some 400,000 Muslims, out of fear of Greek, Serbian or Bulgarian atrocities, left with the retreating Ottoman army. The Baghdad Railway under German control was a proposal to build rail lines into Iraq. The railway was not actually built at this time but its prospect worried the British until that issue was resolved in 1914. The railway did not play a role in the origins of World War I.

===World War I (1914–1918)===
The Young Turk government had signed a secret treaty with Germany and established the Ottoman–German Alliance in August 1914, aimed against the common Russian enemy but aligning the Empire with the German side. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I after the &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; incident, in which it gave safe harbour to two German ships that were fleeing British ships. These ships then—after having officially been transferred to the Ottoman Navy, but effectively still under German control—attacked the Russian port of Sevastopol, thus dragging the Empire into the war on the side of the Central Powers, in which it took part in the Middle Eastern theatre. There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut, but there were setbacks as well, such as the disastrous Caucasus Campaign against the Russians. The United States never declared war against the Ottoman Empire.


In 1915, as the Russian Caucasus Army continued to advance in eastern Anatolia with the help of Armenian volunteer units from the Caucasus region of the Russian Empire, and aided by some Ottoman Armenians, the Ottoman government decided to issue the Tehcir Law, which started the deportation of the ethnic Armenians, particularly from the provinces close to the Ottoman–Russian front, resulting in what became known as the Armenian genocide. Through forced marches and gang skirmishes, the Armenians living in eastern Anatolia were uprooted from their ancestral homelands and sent southwards to the Ottoman provinces in Syria and Mesopotamia. Estimates vary on how many Armenians perished, but scholars give figures ranging from 300,000 (per the modern Turkish state), 600,000 (per early estimates by Western researchers) to up to 1.5 million (per modern Western and Armenian scholars).

The Arab Revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans at the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. When the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, the only parts of the Arabian peninsula that were still under Ottoman control were Yemen, Asir, the city of Medina, portions of northern Syria and portions of northern Iraq. These territories were handed over to the British forces on 23 January 1919. The Ottomans were also forced to evacuate the parts of the former Russian Empire in the Caucasus (in present-day Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan), which they had gained towards the end of World War I, following Russia&#x27;s retreat from the war with the Russian Revolution in 1917.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres, the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was solidified. The new countries created from the former territories of the Ottoman Empire currently number 39.

===Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923)===

The occupation of Constantinople along with the occupation of İzmir mobilized the establishment of the Turkish national movement, which won the 1919–1923 Turkish War of Independence under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The Sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI Vahdettin (), left the country on 17 November 1922. The new independent Grand National Assembly of Turkey (GNA) was internationally recognized with the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923. The GNA officially declared the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. The Caliphate was constitutionally abolished several months later, on 3 March 1924. The Sultan and his family were declared personae non gratae of Turkey and exiled.

== Ottoman dynasty after dissolution ==

In 1974, descendants of the dynasty were granted the right to acquire Turkish citizenship by the Grand National Assembly, and were notified that they could apply. Mehmed Orhan, son of Prince Mehmed Abdul Kadir of the Ottoman Empire, died in 1994, leaving the grandson of Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II, Ertuğrul Osman, as the eldest surviving member of the deposed dynasty. Osman for many years refused to carry a Turkish passport, calling himself a citizen of the Ottoman Empire. Despite this attitude, he put the matter of an Ottoman restoration to rest when he told an interviewer &quot;no&quot; to the question of whether he wished the Ottoman Empire to be restored. He was quoted as saying that &quot;democracy works well in Turkey.&quot; He returned to Turkey in 1992 for the first time since the exile, and became a Turkish citizen with a Turkish passport in 2002.

On 23 September 2009, Osman died at the age of 97 in Istanbul, and with his death the last of the line born under the Ottoman Empire was extinguished. In Turkey, Osman was known as &quot;the last Ottoman&quot;.

Harun Osmanoğlu, the 3rd generation grandson of Abdul Hamid II, is the eldest living member of the former ruling dynasty.

==Fall of the Empire==

In many ways, the circumstances surrounding the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s fall were a result of tensions between the Empire&#x27;s different ethnic groups and the various governments&#x27; inability to deal with these tensions. The introduction of increased cultural rights, civil liberties and a parliamentary system during the Tanzimat proved too late to reverse the nationalistic and secessionist trends that had already been set in motion since the early 19th century.

<doc id="535245" wikidata="Q7368698" url="?curid=535245" title="Timeline of Rosetta (spacecraft)">
<text>&quot;Rosetta&quot; is a space probe designed to rendezvous with the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, perform flybys of two asteroids (2867 Šteins and 21 Lutetia), and carry lander &quot;Philae&quot; until its landing on 67P. This page records a detailed timeline of this mission.
==Launch and cruise phase (2004 - 2014)==

*16 February 2004 — The &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft was placed on top of its Ariane 5 rocket at the Guiana Space Centre, Kourou.
*26 February 2004 — Countdown was stopped at 20 minutes and 40 seconds before lift off due to strong winds in the upper atmosphere, causing the launch to be rescheduled for the next day.
*27 February 2004 — Before launch, a piece of detached foam was discovered, which prompted a round of technical inspections. Launch was rescheduled to very early March.
*2 March 2004 — The spacecraft launched at 07:17 GMT. The Ariane 5 placed the upper stage and the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft into an eccentric coast orbit (200 x 4000 km). About two hours later, at 09:14 GMT, the upper stage fired to leave the orbit around the Earth and enter heliocentric orbit. &quot;Rosetta&quot; was released 18 minutes later, and soon afterwards ESA’s Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt established contact with the spacecraft.
*3 March 2004 — The S Band communication commenced with &quot;Rosetta&quot;, using both low- and high-gain antenna configurations. Also, all reaction wheels were in operation, compensating for large disturbances due to outgassing from the space craft, which was expected to last for a few days in the vacuum of space, whilst trapped atmospheric gases escaped.
*4 March 2004 — The power subsystem of &quot;Rosetta&quot; was tested and commissioned.
*5 March 2004 — &quot;Rosetta&quot; X band communications were commissioned.
*7-10 March 2004 — The first three instruments (Cosima, CONSERT(Orbiter part) and Osiris) were activated and completed their initial commissioning activities. The CONSERT Orbiter antenna was also deployed.
*11 March 2004 — The &quot;Rosetta&quot; Science Working Team announces that the accuracy of launch made it possible to select two asteroids as targets for a rendezvous fly-by of the probe. &quot;Comets and asteroids are the building blocks of our Earth and the other planets in the Solar System. &quot;Rosetta&quot; will conduct the most thorough analysis so far of three of these objects,&quot; said Prof. David Southwood, Director of ESA&#x27;s Science Programme in a press release.
*12-17 March 2004 — Starting on 12 March, the lander was commissioned. Only one step was rescheduled due to early release of the launch locks during the first mission day.
*17-19 March 2004 — The Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) instruments were commissioned. An issue arose with the redundant power supply, but did not substantially affect the mission. The spacecraft booms, carrying the RPC MIP (Mutual Impedance Probe) and LAP (Langmuir Probe) instruments were deployed by using the primary systems.
*26 March 2004 — Checking out was completed on three instruments: ROSINA, ALICE, and VIRTIS, during commissioning activities. Each activity took two days and was within or ahead of schedule. The High Gain Antenna (HGA) emission pattern was calibrated by performing spiral maneuvers. The radio station at New Norcia was used to measure antenna gain.
*30 March 2004 — The RSI (Radio Science Instrument) completed five days of commissioning.
*3 April 2004 — The MIRO instrument checked out well after three commissioning passes through more spiral maneuvers, during which the planet Venus was scanned.
*4 April 2004 — The &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft was pointed into its attitude towards Earth, which is to be kept for the remainder of the year. Slight adjustments are planned to avoid having the sunlight hit &quot;Rosetta&quot; head-on. (Also called &quot;+X&quot; axis). The GIADA instrument was activated and commissioned.
*4-9 April 2004 — The last instrument on board &quot;Rosetta&quot; (MIDAS) was turned on during 4 April and commissioning concluded on 9 April. By this point all science and engineering subsystems had been activated at least once.
**Use of the radio station at New Norcia was reduced from 11 hours to 7 hours, to allow more time for the Mars Express mission.
*10-15 April 2004 — From 10 April to 15 April, checking out procedures were conducted on the &quot;Philae&quot; lander. This second lander activity focused on the lander&#x27;s payload. The ALICE instrument was activated again and high voltage operations were executed. Other activities were also performed, including an adjustment of the internal heater system due to the decreasing distance to the Sun.
*17 April 2004 — An attempt was made to open the ALICE detector door. However a pyrotechnic fastener designed to open it did not fire.
*21 April 2004 — After some investigation, a backup pyro was fired to successfully release the ALICE detector door.
*25 April 2004 — During a test sequence using an Earth pointing attitude, the thruster temperature (heated by the sun) caused an unplanned &quot;slew&quot; to occur. This mechanism is used to prevent the thrusters from overheating. Due to this maneuver, a planned imaging activity of the Earth-Moon system was cancelled, but the remaining commissioning activities were completed satisfactorily.
*1 May 2004 — The first scientific observations were performed at this date. The instruments were pointed towards the comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), at that time close to the sun.
*6 May 2004 — In preparation for the first deep space maneuver of &quot;Rosetta&quot; a total of 12 pyro valves were fired, and the pressure in the reaction control system started to build up as expected.
*10 May 2004 — The most critical deep space maneuver was successfully executed. The four thrusters on board of &quot;Rosetta&quot; were fired for about 3.5 hours, and a velocity change (delta v) of 152.8 metre per second was imparted to the spacecraft.
*16 May 2004 — A planned &quot;touch-up&quot; deep space maneuver was successfully executed. A burn of just under 17 minutes was performed with high accuracy. Then &quot;Rosetta&quot; pointed its instruments again towards Comet LINEAR for observation.
*28 May 2004 — ESA released the first pictures taken with the OSIRIS camera during the April 30 observation tests pointed at comet LINEAR. The camera produced high-resolution images of the comet from a distance of about 95 million kilometres.
*7 June 2004 — &quot;Rosetta&quot; switched into &quot;Cruise Mode&quot; after completing all steps for commissioning the instruments.
*25 July 2004 — A week of increased activities during the &quot;Cruise 1&quot; phase included the commissioning of the two navigation cameras by taking pictures of the Earth and the Moon.
*4 March 2005 — The first planned flyby of Earth was executed successfully. ESA asks amateur astronomers that took pictures of the spacecraft to submit them. Also, tests with the Moon as target standing in for a comet or asteroid, produced pictures and other data as expected.
*March 24 — &quot;Rosetta&quot; transitioned back into &quot;cruise mode&quot;.
*15 April 2005 — A test of the Near Sun Hibernation Mode (NSHM) was successfully concluded. It started on April 11 and tested a special low activity mode of &quot;Rosetta&quot;. In this state the gyroscopes and reaction wheels are inactive, and the craft is using the star tracker and the thrusters to control its attitude, only.
*18 July 2005 — ESA reported that the observation of the Deep Impact encounter with comet Tempel 1 was very successful. Science data was recorded and down-linked to Earth during the period from June 28 until July 14, and the data is currently being analysed.
*8 August 2005 — Mission members performed an unplanned monitor pass to investigate anomalies in the spacecraft&#x27;s dynamic behavior. On mission day 213 and 216 a total of 20 grams of fuel were spent and a delta-v of 2.5 mm per second were added unexpectedly.
*15 September 2005 — Telemetry received showed that a solar flare had hit the spacecraft around September 8 or 9. The star tracker subsystem was left in an abnormal state and needed to be fixed.
*12 March 2006 — The OSIRIS instrument was trained on the future flyby target asteroid Steins for science observation, and the data was downlinked to Earth over three days just before solar conjunction.
*6 July 2006 — The spacecraft comes within 0.06 AU of the ion trail of comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova and scientific observations are planned for this event.
*25 February 2007 — The spacecraft approaches Mars up to 250 km.
*14 November 2007 — Second Earth swing-by for Rosetta passing within 5295 km from the surface.
*5 September 2008 — Rosetta flies by asteroid 2867 Šteins at a distance of c. 800 km.
*13 November 2009 — Rosetta flies by Earth. Using the Earth&#x27;s&#x27; gravitational pull to build speed. Rosetta does this on nearly every flyby of a planet.
*10 July 2010 — Flyby of asteroid 21 Lutetia
*8 June 2011 — The spacecraft was transferred into a spin stabilised mode and all electronics except the onboard computer and the hibernation heaters were switched off.

==Mission phase (2014 - 2016)==
* 20 January 2014 — At 10:00 CET the spacecraft woke up and started post-hibernation procedures. &quot;Rosetta&quot; restored communications with ESA&#x27;s Operations Centre through NASA’s Goldstone ground station at 18:17 CET. Greets the Earth with a &quot;Hello World&quot; message. The message was received on a very low bit level. Over the next months ESA&#x27;s job will be to raise communication speed through a software update.
* 7 May 2014 — First of ten Orbital Correction Manoeuvres (OCMs) (1 h 33 min 13 s) to align the trajectories of Rosetta and 67P/C-G, delta-v of (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - )
* 21 May 2014 — OCM 2 of 10, longest burn (7 h 16 min) with largest delta-v () using approximately of fuel (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - )
* 4 June 2014 — OCM 3 of 10, 6 h 39 min burn time with a delta-v of using approximately of fuel (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - )
* 18 June 2014 — OCM 4 of 10, 2 h 20 min burn time with a delta-v of , this was an over performance of 5%, the first notable deviation from expected performance. (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - 195,000 km)
* 2 July 2014 — OCM 5 of 10, delta-v of 59 m/s (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - 52,000 km)
* 9 July 2014 — OCM 6 of 10, delta-v of 25 m/s (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - 22,000 km)
* 16 July 2014 — OCM 7 of 10, delta-v of 11 m/s (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - 9,600 km)
* 23 July 2014 — OCM 8 of 10, delta-v of 4.5 m/s (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - 4,100 km)
* 3 August 2014 — OCM 9 of 10, delta-v of 3.2 m/s (approximate distance to 67P/C-G - 1,000 km)
* 6 August 2014 — OCM 10 of 10, delta-v of 1 m/s. &quot;Rosetta&quot; enters a hyperbolic orbit around 67P/C-G, becoming the first man made object to enter orbit around a comet.
* 4 September 2014 — The first science data from &quot;Rosetta&quot; ALICE instrument was reported, showing that the comet is unusually dark in ultraviolet wavelengths, hydrogen and oxygen are present in the coma, and no significant areas of water-ice have been found on the comet&#x27;s surface. Water-ice was expected to be found as the comet is too far from the Sun to turn water into vapor.
* 10 September 2014 — &quot;Rosetta&quot; enters the Global Mapping Phase, orbiting 67/C-G at an altitude of .
* 12 November 2014 — &quot;Philae&quot; successfully landed after touching down three times, on the surface of 67P/G-C without firing its harpoons. Touchdown 16:08 GMT.
* 15 November 2014 — &quot;Philae&quot; battery exhausted after insufficient collection of solar energy. It is possible that the conditions may change as the comet moves closer to the Sun, making it possible to charge the battery.
* 10 December 2014 — The &quot;Rosetta&#x27;s&quot; Rosina mass spectrometers report that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67P is more than three times that on Earth. The ratio is regarded as a distinctive signature and the discovery means that Earth&#x27;s water is unlikely to have originated from comets like 67P.
* 14 April 2015 — Scientists report that the comet&#x27;s nucleus has no magnetic field of its own.
* 13 June 2015 — &quot;Philae&quot; lander says &quot;Hello&quot; and comes back online.

* 14 September 2015 — Gaia photographs 67/P.
* 23 September 2015 — Release of studies of the water-ice cycle on a comet.
* 25 September 2015 — Detection of argon on a comet is announced.
* 28 September 2015 — Scientists release an answer to how comet got its shape.
* September - October 2015 — From late September to early October Rosetta flew up to 1500 km away from the comet for further study while it&#x27;s still near the perihelion.
* 1 October 2015 — Scientists release the results of a first study of the comet&#x27;s southern pole made in August and October 2015.
* 28 October 2015 — First detection of the molecular oxygen on a comet is announced.
* 12 November 2015 — Release of the SESAME-CASSE instrument recording &quot;listening&quot; to MUPUS hammering the surface.
* 13 January 2016 — Confirmation that the exposed ice on a surface of the comet is indeed water ice.
* 2 September 2016 - &quot;Rosetta&quot; finds its lander &quot;Philae&quot; wedged against a large overhang.
* 30 September 2016 — The &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft ended its mission by an attempt to soft-land close to a wide pit, called Deir el-Medina, on comet 67P. The walls of the pit contain wide so-called &quot;goose bumps&quot;, considered to be building blocks of the comet.

<text>The Moby Project is a collection of public-domain lexical resources created by Grady Ward. The resources were dedicated to the public domain, and are now mirrored at Project Gutenberg. , it contains the largest free phonetic database, with 177,267 words and corresponding pronunciations.

== Hyphenator ==
The Moby Hyphenator II contains hyphenations of 187,175 words and phrases (including 9,752 entries where no hyphenations are given, such as &quot;through&quot; and &quot;avoir&quot;). The character encoding appears to be MacRoman, and hyphenation is indicated by a bullet (, character value 165 decimal, or A5 hexadecimal). Some entries, however, have a combination of actual hyphens and character 165, such as &quot;&quot;.

There is little to no documentation of the hyphenation choices made; the following examples might give some flavour of the style of hyphenation used: .

== Languages ==
Moby Language II contains wordlists of five languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. Their statistics are:

However, some of the lists are contaminated: for example, the Japanese list contains English words such as &quot;abnormal&quot; and non-words such as &#x27; and &#x27;. There are also unusual peculiarities in the sorting of these lists, as the French list contains a straight alphabetical listing, while the German list contains the alphabetical listing of traditionally capitalized words and then the alphabetical listing of traditionally lower-cased words. The list of Italian words, however, contains no capitalized words whatsoever.

The lists do not use accented characters, so &quot;&quot; is how a user would look up the French word &quot; (&quot;to be&quot;).

== Part-of-Speech ==
Moby Part-of-Speech contains 233,356 words fully described by part(s) of speech, listed in priority order. The format of the file is &quot;word\parts-of-speech&quot;, with the following parts of speech being identified:

== Pronunciator ==
The Moby Pronunciator II contains 177,267 entries with corresponding pronunciations. Most of the entries describe a single word, but approximately 79,000 contain hyphenated or multiple word phrases, names, or lexemes. The Project Gutenberg distribution also contains a copy of the cmudict v0.3. The file contains lines of the format &quot;word[/part-of-speech] pronunciation&quot;. Each line is ended with the ASCII carriage return character (CR, &#x27;\r&#x27;, 0x0D, 13 in decimal).

The &quot;word&quot; field can include apostrophes (e.g. &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;), hyphens (e.g. &quot;able-bodied&quot;), and multiple words separated by underscores (e.g. &#x27;). Non-English words are generally rendered, as stated in the documentation, without accents or other diacritical marks. However, in 36 entries (e.g. &#x27;), some non-ASCII accented characters remain, represented using Mac OS Roman encoding.

The part-of-speech field is used to disambiguate 770 of the words which have differing pronunciations depending on their part-of-speech. For example, for the words spelled &quot;close,&quot; the verb has the pronunciation , whereas the adjective is . The parts-of-speech have been assigned the following codes:

Following this is the pronunciation. Several special symbols are present:

The rest of the symbols are used to represent IPA characters. The pronunciations are generally consistent with a General American dialect of English, that exhibits father-bother merger, hurry-furry merger and lot-cloth split, but does not exhibit cot-caught merger or wine-whine merger. Each phoneme is represented by a sequence of one or more characters. Some of the sequences are delimited with a slash character &quot;/&quot;, as shown in the following table, but note that the sequence for is delimited by &quot;two&quot; slash characters at either end:

To this collection are added a number of extra sequences representing phonemes found in several other languages. These are used to encode the non-English words, phrases and names that are included in the database. The following table contains these extra phonemes, but note that the extent to which some of these may exist due to encoding errors is not clear.
== Shakespeare ==
Moby Shakespeare contains the complete unabridged works of Shakespeare. This specific resource is not available from Project Gutenberg, but it is available in a 1993 version on the web.

== Thesaurus ==
The Moby Thesaurus II contains 30,260 root words, with 2,520,264 synonyms and related terms – an average of 83.3 per root word. Each line consists of a list of comma-separated values, with the first term being the root word, and all following words being related terms.

Grady Ward placed this thesaurus in the public domain in 1996. It is also available as a Debian package although the package has been discontinued starting with Bullseye.

== Words ==
Moby Words II is the largest wordlist in the world. The distribution consists of the following 16 files:

<text>The Stillwater River is a tributary of the Yellowstone River. Approximately 70 miles (113 km) long, it runs through southern Montana in the United States. The Stillwater River has also been known as: the Itchkeppearja River, Rose River, Rosebud River and Stillwater Creek.

The river was affected by the 2022 Montana floods.

==General==
The Stillwater River rises at the north slope of Miller Mountain, south of the Beartooth Mountains in southern Park County, near the state line with Wyoming and the boundary of Yellowstone National Park. It flows northeast, between the Absaroka Range to the west and the Beartooth Mountains to the east, through Custer National Forest, past Nye and Absarokee. It joins the Yellowstone near Columbus, Montana.

==Fishing==
This Stillwater is a Blue Ribbon fishery. Trout are the primary game fish, but Mountain Whitefish are also common. In the river&#x27;s lower sections, Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout are the most common, but towards the headwaters Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Brook Trout show up with increased frequency. In the spring Rainbow Trout from the Yellowstone River enter the Stillwater to spawn, some traveling as far upstream as Nye. In the fall, Brown Trout also enter the river from the Yellowstone to spawn. It is during these seasons that larger fish up to 5 pounds can be more easily found. The Stillwater is often overlooked, but is one of Montana&#x27;s greatest fisheries.

Despite its misleading name, the Stillwater&#x27;s most popular stretches contain class II and III whitewater. While float fishing from a raft is a common way to fish the river, it is recommended that only experienced rowers attempt to navigate it.

<doc id="535259" wikidata="Q169298" url="?curid=535259" title="Zombie (The Cranberries song)">
<text>&quot;Zombie&quot; is a protest song by Irish alternative rock band the Cranberries. It was written by the lead singer, Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, about the young victims of a bombing in Warrington, England, during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The song was released on 19 September 1994 by Island Records as the lead single from the Cranberries&#x27; second studio album, &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; (1994). Critics have described &quot;Zombie&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece of alternative rock&quot;, with grunge-style distorted guitar and shouted vocals uncharacteristic of the band&#x27;s other work.

While Island feared releasing a politically charged song as a single, &quot;Zombie&quot; reached No. 1 on the charts of Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, and Iceland. The song did not chart on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, but it reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay chart. Listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J voted it No. 1 on the 1994 Triple J Hottest 100 chart, and it won the Best Song Award at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards. The music video was directed by Samuel Bayer, and featured O&#x27;Riordan singing while painted gold, and footage of war-torn Belfast. In April 2020, it became the first song by an Irish group to surpass one billion views on YouTube.

The Cranberries noted that &quot;Zombie&quot; drew strong responses from audiences. After O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death in 2018, it became an Irish stadium anthem, first for the teams from the Cranberries&#x27; hometown of Limerick, and later for the Ireland national rugby union team starting in the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The band recorded acoustic, stripped-down versions on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; and the 2017 album &quot;Something Else&quot;. &quot;Zombie&quot; has been covered by numerous artists; O&#x27;Riordan had planned to contribute vocals to a version by the American band Bad Wolves, which was released days after her death.

== Background and composition ==

The Troubles were a conflict in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s to 1998. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), an Irish republican paramilitary organisation, waged an armed campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the region with the Republic of Ireland. Republican and Unionist paramilitaries killed more than 3,500 people, many from thousands of bomb attacks. One of the bombings happened on 20 March 1993, as two IRA improvised explosive devices hidden in litter bins were detonated in a shopping street in Warrington, England. Two children; Johnathan Ball, aged 3, and Tim Parry, aged 12, were killed in the attack. 56 people were injured. Ball died at the scene of the bombing as a result of his fragmentation-inflicted injuries, and five days later, Parry lost his life in a hospital as a result of head injuries. O&#x27;Riordan decided to write a song that reflected upon the event and the children&#x27;s deaths after visiting the town:

O&#x27;Riordan stated the song came to her &quot;subconsciously&quot; midway through the Cranberries&#x27; English tour in 1993, writing the core chords on her acoustic guitar. Once O&#x27;Riordan was back in her hometown of Limerick and returned to her apartment after a night out, she played those chords and started building a song around them, quickly &quot;coming up with the chorus, which was catchy and anthemic&quot;, and soon moving onto the verses. O&#x27;Riordan took the song idea, originally titled &quot;In Your Head&quot;, into the Cranberries&#x27; small rehearsal shed in Mungret. Given she was playing an acoustic guitar, the rest of the band initially followed along in, as guitarist Noel Hogan put it, &quot;that kind of sweet indie pop thing&quot; that the band featured in their other songs, before O&#x27;Riordan decided that it was not what she wanted, picked up an electric guitar and stated that &quot;it needs to be heavy because it&#x27;s angry&quot;. Drummer Fergal Lawler recalled that usually in that small room, &quot;you&#x27;re trying to keep it low because you don&#x27;t want to deafen anybody&quot;, but O&#x27;Riordan played it loud and &quot;we couldn&#x27;t really hear the lyrics because she was singing through her guitar&quot;, and that the singer was adamant that she wanted more distortion pedals on the guitars and asked for more strength than usual in drumming.

== Production and release ==
Soon after &quot;Zombie&quot; was completed, the band brought it onto their set list, with Lawler noting that the song was played live for a whole year before being recorded, and audiences responded with enthusiasm. The song was recorded and mixed at The Manor Studio in Oxford and at Townhouse Studios in London in 1994 with producer Stephen Street. They spent a long time working on getting the guitar settings right to give a suitably expansive sound, with O&#x27;Riordan noting &quot;the sound came organically, because we were using our live instruments, we were plugging in a lot, and we started to mess around with feedback and distortion&quot;. Hogan contributed rhythm guitar to provide textures under O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s riffs. The song represented a radical departure from the sound based largely on jangly guitar and strings that the band showcased on debut album &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot;. Hogan stated that &quot;Zombie&quot; made the band realize &quot;that you can actually be heavy and still have melody&quot;, marking a changing point in their composition style and live performances.

Knowing of the song&#x27;s potential, the Cranberries wanted &quot;Zombie&quot; to be lead single in advance of the album &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;. Former manager Allen Kovac stated that Island Records urged them not to release the &quot;politically urgent&quot; song as a single, and that O&#x27;Riordan had ripped up a $1-million cheque the label offered her to work on another song. &quot;Dolores was a very small, fragile person, but very opinionated,&quot; said Kovac. &quot;Her belief was that she was an international artist and she wanted to break the rest of the world, and &#x27;Zombie&#x27; was part of that evolution. She felt the need to expand beyond &#x27;I love you, you love me&#x27; and write about what was happening in Ireland at the time&quot;, he said. Island Records and management also claimed that the song was &quot;too controversial, you might not get played on the radio&quot;. Hogan added that the label were not expecting a lead single sounding different from the band&#x27;s output &quot;instead of coming out with another &#x27;Linger&#x27; or &#x27;Dreams&#x27;&quot;. Lawler recalled arguing to the record label that during the year the band had played &quot;Zombie&quot; in concert, &quot;for a new song that the audience hadn&#x27;t heard before, they really reacted to it&quot;, which was &quot;a sign that it&#x27;s a catchy song. People like it. It has to work.” Over time, &quot;[w]e pushed and pushed and eventually they decided to release it&quot;, he said. By the time the single for &quot;Zombie&quot; was released on 19 September 1994, as well as its parent album &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; the following month, with an accompanying music video for the song in heavy rotation on MTV, the Cranberries were catapulted to international stardom. Shortly after the song and video came out, ideological beliefs came rushing to the forefront of local newspapers, criticizing O&#x27;Riordan for &quot;writing about the Troubles&quot;; of these comments, she &quot;knew that would be the angle of the song, because it was controversial&quot;. Assessing the cultural impact of their song, Hogan responded: &quot;Because of this song, people thought we were a political band. ... Far from it. Dolores always wrote from the heart&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan would later state, &quot;If I think something, I have to say it. And I really don&#x27;t care what anybody thinks, you know?&quot;. &quot;NPR&quot;″s Andrew Limbong, speaking after O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death in 2018, said &quot;even though it was a political song, it wasn&#x27;t necessarily politics she was interested in writing about&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan said, &quot;I just cannot accept children being slaughtered at the hands of political violence&quot;, and hoped that &quot;it might make people reflect a bit on our society and what we&#x27;ve become.&quot;

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Zombie&quot; has been characterised by commentators as alternative rock and grunge. O&#x27;Riordan later said that the song was not a concerted effort to ride the grunge movement, but she stated that &quot;this wasn&#x27;t grunge, but the timing was good&quot;, adding, that &quot;[w]e were just a different type of a band... and we had a lot of our own ideas&quot;. Hogan noted in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that the Cranberries were beforehand accepted by &quot;the same kind of [grunge] audience&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan was responsible for the heavier sound, a mere expression of her musical taste, as she would say later &quot;we got it out of our system... all that anger out of our system&quot;. Discussing the musical approach for the song and the requirement of a sound significantly louder, Hogan explained in a 2012 interview with Amsterdam&#x27;s &quot;FaceCulture&quot; that &quot;the heavier sound was the right thing for the song. If it was soft, it wouldn&#x27;t have had that impact. It would stand out in the live set because of that&quot;. Particularly offended that terrorists claimed to have carried out these acts in the name of Ireland, O&#x27;Riordan asserted: &quot;The IRA are not me. I&#x27;m not the IRA. The Cranberries are not the IRA. My family are not. When it says in the song, &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s not my family&quot;,&#x27; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. It&#x27;s not Ireland, it&#x27;s some idiots living in the past&quot;. At the time, O&#x27;Riordan received criticism for &quot;Zombie&quot;″s &quot;hard-hitting lyrics&quot;; she nevertheless pointed out that the song was written from a humanitarian point of view. O’Riordan&#x27;s mother Eileen has stated, &quot;It wasn’t written as a political song but as an anti-violence, an anti-war song.&quot;

O&#x27;Riordan never revealed the origin of the &quot;zombie&quot; reference in the lyrics, a concept which admits a personal interpretation of its meaning. However, there was a divergence of opinion among writers on the subject. Writing for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Ed Power formulated his own hypothesis, saying that the word &quot;Zombie&quot; was &quot;a commentary on how blindly cleaving to centuries old prejudices can reduce [one&#x27;s] capacity for independent thought&quot;. &quot;Culture Trip&quot; writer Graham Fuller commented that the metaphor perhaps &quot;reanimates the children whose deaths inspired O&#x27;Riordan to write it&quot;. Sonia Saraiya, music and TV critic from &quot;Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, had a different view, saying that the &quot;Zombie&quot; is not the dead children, but &quot;the dead children that populate your mind; the dead bodies you&#x27;ve seen in the images that you can&#x27;t forget&quot;.

=== Singing voice ===
O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s vocals were noted as reminiscent of the sean-nós singing style, for the rapid and repeated changes in pitch, most notably yodeling when she does the sharp break from chest register to head register in the second syllable of the word &quot;Zom-bie&quot;, and doing an amplified method forming her vowels and consonants. This creates a vocal trademark when combined with the Gaelic keening, the lilting vocables, and sung in her thick Irish accent. Author Bart Plantenga wrote in his book &quot;Yodel in Hi-Fi: From Kitsch Folk to Contemporary Electronica&quot; that &quot;[h]er waify, quavering, breaking voice has a natural &#x27;Celtic yodel&#x27; in it. It can also be heard on &#x27;Zombie [and other songs] used &quot;for fantastic emotional effect&quot;. Mikael Wood of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described O&#x27;Riordan &quot;pushing her voice to a jagged extreme to embody the pain&quot;, with a &quot;desperate, yodeling vocal that conjures some ancient emotion&quot;. &quot;Far Out Magazine&quot; commented that her vocal performance was &quot;guttural, pleading, captivating and utterly unique, O&#x27;Riordan begs for humanity the only way she knew how&quot;. Saraiya wrote that her voice &quot;often seemed bigger than her petite frame&quot;, and also commented that the chorus &quot;practically grunted out of her otherwise bell-like voice with a guttural vowel sound&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
===Praise===
&quot;Tedium&quot;&#x27;s editor Ernie Smith said, &quot;O&#x27;Riordan wrote it in a moment of anger and passion&quot;, and called the song &quot;one of the defining songs of the alternative rock era&quot;. In a different perspective, Rebecca Black of &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; described &quot;Zombie&quot; as an &quot;outraged response to the Warrington bombs&quot;, while music reporter Mark Savage wrote that &quot;her pain was real&quot;, describing it as &quot;a visceral response to the death of two children&quot;. In a contemporary review, &quot;Hot Press&quot; hailed the song and its arrangements, saying that it was stylistically different from the band&#x27;s previous works: &quot;Staccato rhythms and subtle jerks and pauses in the music and the singing make this more than just business-as-usual for the Cranberries. A slow, brooding Siouxsie-like buzzing guitar melody and dirge-like bass and drums counterpoint the elliptical and impassioned vocals of Dolores O&#x27;Riordan as she works her way through the internal psychic and external human tragedies of the Troubles [...] &quot;Zombie&quot; signals a growth in confidence&quot;. &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; identified the album &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; as &quot;more of the same&quot; as the Cranberries&#x27; debut album, except for the song &quot;Zombie&quot;, which had an &quot;angry grunge&quot; sound and &quot;aggressive&quot; lyrics. Music critic Evelyn McDonnell allowed that O&#x27;Riordan had a &quot;certain naivety to her and also a real toughness&quot;. New York arts editor Graham Fuller partially echoed this view, saying &quot;she was right, but that naivety serves a song that&#x27;s an unfiltered reaction to a tragedy. It goes with Zombie&#x27;s primal fury; slicker lyrics would have diluted the song&#x27;s rawness&quot;. 

Music critic Neil McCormick wrote that it was the Cranberries&#x27; &quot;fiercest rock song... An accusatory lament, it grapples with the endless recriminations of the Irish Troubles, with a slow rolling bass line and thumping mid-tempo beat, finding tension between melodic delicacy and introspection in the verses with a keening, wailing chorus charged with distorted grungy guitars&quot;. &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; stated that it &quot;combines moody soundscapes with some grunge-y guitar attacks that together make an arresting number&quot;. Mark Morris from &quot;Select&quot; wrote in his review of the album, &quot;The surprise is &#x27;Zombie&#x27;, a Sinéad-like tantrum of crunchy guitars and confused lyrics about guns and bombs.&quot; Charles Aaron from &quot;Spin&quot; commented, &quot;I like &quot;Zombie&quot; because its crunching, troubled guitar fuzz was the loudest thing on MTV during the last days of &#x27;94. Just ask Bono, my Irish Setter. He&#x27;s still wailing.&quot; Josh Jones of Open Culture, described the &quot;Gen X heyday&quot;″s song, as &quot;O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s stadium-size hit ... and its beautifully pained laments and pointedly unsubtle yelps and wails—a stunning expression of mourning that reverberates still some 25 years later&quot;. Martin Aston of &quot;Music Week&quot; wrote: &quot;Having broken the UK on the back of their US success, the Cranberries continue to use their pop acumen to fashion wonderful, wistful pop nuggets. &#x27;Zombie&#x27; is a little heavier and less user-friendly than &#x27;Linger&#x27; and &#x27;Dreams&#x27;, but no less sublime for it.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked the song number three and number two, respectively, on their lists of the top ten Cranberries songs.

On 16 January 2018, following O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death, Colin Parry, father of IRA victim Tim Parry, thanked O&#x27;Riordan for the &quot;both majestic and also very real lyrics&quot;. &quot;Many people have become immune to the pain and suffering that so many people experienced during that armed campaign&quot;, he said. &quot;To read the words written by an Irish band in such a compelling way was very, very powerful.&quot;

===Criticism===
Paul Brannigan of &quot;Louder&quot; writes, &quot;Not everyone, however, was impressed by [O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s] credentials for the role of commentator on one of the most complex conflicts of the modern era.&quot; AllMusic said the song &quot;trivialised&quot; the events of the Troubles, and that the &quot;heavy rock trudge&quot; did not play to the band&#x27;s strengths. Upon the song&#x27;s release, David Stubbs from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said, &quot;&#x27;Zombie&#x27; doesn&#x27;t make a born-again fan of me, with its lethargic, samey, grungy riff lurching predictably towards anthem status. But I like Dolores O&#x27; Riordan&#x27;s vocal, like Dana on heroin, all tattered, snarling and trembling at her wits&#x27; end.&quot; At the same time, Northern Irish band Schtum told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s from Limerick, what the fuck would she know? You&#x27;re talking about the last 25 years of a much bigger and wider problem that has gone on for hundreds of years&quot;. Brannigan writes: 

Iestyn George from &quot;NME&quot; felt &quot;the timing of this release, as much as the sentimental itself, seems more than a little askew&quot;. Female pop-punk music duo Shampoo reviewed the song for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, giving it two out of five.

=== Accolades ===
On 23 November 1995, the Cranberries won the Best Song Award for &quot;Zombie&quot; at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards.

In November 2022, the song was voted as the greatest Irish hit of all time by RTÉ 2fm listeners in compiling the ultimate Irish playlist for a television special shown on RTÉ One.

=== As a sporting anthem ===
Following the death of O&#x27;Riordan in 2018, the hurling team from her home county of Limerick adopted &quot;Zombie&quot; as their anthem during their successful run to the All-Ireland Championship. It soon became a rugby anthem as well; Limerick-based Munster initially played it in tribute to O&#x27;Riordan, and crowd reaction led to it becoming a post-match staple.

The song was re-popularised in 2023 after it was played after Ireland games at the 2023 Rugby World Cup. It was picked up by fans of the Irish team, with videos of fans singing the song in chorus accumulating hundreds of thousands of views on social media. This offended Irish nationalists, who identified it as an &quot;anti-IRA&quot; anthem, and said that the lyrics failed to consider their experience during the Troubles. 

Irish political leaders supported the use of the song as a rugby anthem. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described it as &quot;a song that we can all sing comfortably. It’s an anti-terrorism song. It’s not a nationalist or unionist song.&quot; SDLP leader Colum Eastwood wrote that &quot;&#x27;Zombie&#x27; is an anti-war song written after the IRA killed 2 children in Warrington&quot;, adding that criticism of the IRA is not an endorsement of &quot;British brutality&quot;, writing &quot;Most of us opposed both&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Zombie&quot; topped the charts in many countries. On 29 October 1994, the song went to No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay chart, spending twenty-three weeks on the chart. In 1994, &quot;Zombie&quot; was &quot;the most played song ever on alternative radio in the history of America&quot;, as mentioned in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and in Kenneth L. Campbell&#x27;s book, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s History – Prehistory to the Present&quot;. Junkee journalist Jules LeFevre recalled that Australian audiences were &quot;particularly gripped by the song&quot;, with Triple J listeners voting for &quot;Zombie&quot; as No. 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1994 chart, establishing for the first time ever that a female vocalist won the Triple J Hottest 100. On 18 December 1994, the song reached No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks. The single peaked at No. 1 and spent twenty eight weeks on the Official German Charts. On 25 December 1994, the single debuted at No. 27 on the Ö3 Austria Top 40, and climbed to No. 2, where it stayed for eight weeks. &quot;Zombie&quot; debuted on the French SNEP Top 100 at No. 4 on 25 February 1995. The following week, the single moved to No. 1; it spent nine consecutive weeks at the top and a total of forty-two weeks on the singles chart. The song reached No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.

Island Records declined the prospect of releasing &quot;Zombie&quot; as a single to US stores, stating they didn&#x27;t want to run counter to the band&#x27;s original ethos. Music critic Jon Bream of &quot;Star Tribune&quot; elaborated succinctly the label&#x27;s analysis: &quot;For the band, it&#x27;s a question of credibility&quot;. Bream further noted that Island Records &quot;simply didn&#x27;t want the industry to typecast the Cranberries as a Top 40 act&quot;. After releasing the song, later in the year, the Cranberries affirmed their alternative identity, saying that they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be considered just a pop band&quot;. Drummer Fergal Lawler said, &quot;[t]hen you can go to the other extreme of being so alternative that no one buys your records. Luckily, we&#x27;re kind of in the middle. We&#x27;re a mix of pop, rock and alternative, I suppose.&quot;

After Cranberries&#x27; lead singer O&#x27;Riordan died in January 2018, &quot;Zombie&quot; charted at number 13 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart.

In 2023, the song saw a sales surge in the UK and Ireland during the 2023 Rugby World Cup; the song was played on speakers after every time the Irish team scored. &quot;Zombie&quot; peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart during this time.

== Music video ==
=== Background and production ===
&quot;Zombie&quot; was released with a music video in October 1994. The video was directed by Samuel Bayer, through company HSI Productions. The music video was filmed in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the heart of the Troubles with real footage, and in Dublin. Bayer insisted on going to Belfast for authenticity regarding illustrating &quot;something this visceral and intense&quot;. To record video footage of murals, children and British Army soldiers on patrol, he had a false pretext, with a cover story about making a documentary about the peace-keeping efforts in Ireland. Bayer stated that a shot in the video where an SA80 rifle is pointed directly at the camera is a suspicious British soldier asking him to leave, and that the IRA were keeping a close look at the shoot, given &quot;the British Army come in with fake film crews, getting people on camera.” O&#x27;Riordan remembered Bayer telling her &quot;how tense it was and how he was blown away by the whole thing. He got footage of the kids jumping from one building to another, and he got a lot of footage of the army. He was a very good director&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan also wanted to add images with &quot;an abstract message&quot;, saying it would represent &quot;the beauty that we see in the world or that we care to open our eyes to&quot; while the black and white footage of Belfast &quot;symbolize the pain that’s there and we close our eyes to&quot;. She suggested herself painted gold, and Bayer added children painted silver and a cross that &quot;symbolized Christ suffering and dying, and all the pain that was caused to him&quot;. This was filmed on a sound stage in Los Angeles.

=== Synopsis ===
In the video, O&#x27;Riordan is covered in gold makeup and appears in front of a giant cross with a group of boys characterized as cherubs, covered in silver makeup holding bows and arrows. The video also includes the band playing in Belfast alongside clips of local children playing war games, destroyed buildings, murals with war-related paintings, and of British soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on patrol in Northern Ireland.

=== BBC and RTÉ ban ===
The music video for &quot;Zombie&quot; was banned by the BBC because of its &quot;violent images&quot;. It was also banned by the RTÉ, Ireland&#x27;s national broadcaster. Instead, both the BBC and the RTÉ opted to broadcast an edited version focusing on footage of the band in a live performance, a version that the Cranberries essentially disowned. Despite their efforts to maintain the original video &quot;out of view from the public&quot;, some of the initial footage prevailed, with scenes of children holding guns.

=== Reception and accolades ===
&quot;Zombie&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV Europe and was A-listed on Germany&#x27;s VIVA in December 1994. The video gained a nomination for Best Alternative Video at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards. Writer Josh Jones commented that the video &quot;offers a classic collection of 90s stylistic quirks, from Derek Jarman–inspired setpieces to the use of black and white and earnest political messaging&quot;. He added, &quot;[f]or us old folks, it&#x27;s an almost pure hit of nostalgia, and for the young, a nearly perfect specimen of the decade&#x27;s rock aesthetics&quot;. On 23 October 2019, &quot;Zombie&quot; was ranked No. 5 on a &quot;definitive list of the world&#x27;s most-viewed rock music videos&quot;, released by Vevo.

On 18 April 2020, the official music video had succeeded in reaching over 1 billion views on YouTube and became the first song by an Irish artist, and sixth song from the 20th century to reach the milestone. Bassist Mike Hogan said of the achievement that &quot;I can still remember making such a great video and seeing the impact that it had – and still does – on people&quot;. On 20 April 2020, the music video for &quot;Zombie&quot; remastered in 4K resolution was officially released for YouTube with previously unseen footage from the original video shoot.

== Live performances ==
A version of &quot;Zombie&quot; was already played one year before the release of &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;, on the band&#x27;s first European tour with Hothouse Flowers, after the release of &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot;. One such performance, recorded at the Astoria 2 in London in January 1994, seven months before &quot;Zombie&quot; was released as a single, would later be issued on the 2019 live DVD &quot;The Cranberries Live&quot;.

On 13 August 1994, two months prior to the release of &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;, the Cranberries performed at the Woodstock &#x27;94 music festival in New York. Towards the end of &quot;Zombie&quot;, O&#x27;Riordan dedicated the song to others, like the victims of ethnic cleansing, declaring that &quot;this song is our cry against man&#x27;s inhumanity to man, inhumanity to child&quot;, adding, &quot;and war, babies dying, and Belfast, and Bosnia, and Rwanda&quot;.

The Cranberries kept &quot;Zombie&quot; in their concert setlists throughout their career. On 11 November 1994, the Cranberries featured as the musical guest on US talk show &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, performing the lead single one month after &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; was released. &quot;Junkee&quot; music editor Jules LeFevre, wrote that the footage captured &quot;O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s extraordinary voice&quot; and considered the live performance as &quot;straight-up sublime&quot;.

On 14 February 1995, the band recorded a nine-song set including &quot;Zombie&quot;, for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, accompanied by Electra Strings, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City.

On 25 February 1995, the Cranberries played the song on their appearance on the US show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in a slow tempo performance that British author Dave Thompson called &quot;one of the most powerful performances that the show has ever seen&quot;. The episode came a week after record producer Denny Cordell, an early mentor to the Cranberries, had died. Writer Ed Power wrote that the performance &quot;has the rawness of early grief&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would later declare it &quot;one of the greatest SNL turns&quot;.

The band released a stripped-down version of &quot;Zombie&quot;, recorded for &quot;Something Else&quot;, an unplugged album that features acoustic renditions of songs from their catalog, accompanied by the Limerick-based Irish Chamber Orchestra. The song appeared on the set list of their 2017 tour, featuring the Irish Chamber Orchestra&#x27;s string quartet.

== Censorship ==
In March 2003, on the eve of the outbreak of the Iraq War, the British Government and the Independent Television Commission issued a statement saying ITC&#x27;s Programme Code would temporarily remove from broadcast songs and music videos featuring &quot;sensitive material&quot;, including &quot;Zombie&quot;.
Numerous media groups complied with the decision to avoid &quot;offending public feeling&quot;, along with MTV Europe. Since it violated the ITC guidelines, &quot;Zombie&quot; was placed on a blacklist of songs, targeting its official music video. The censorship was lifted once the war had ended.

In August 2006, CBS censored a performance of &quot;Zombie&quot; by &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; contestant Dilana, as a result of the lyrics and deleted all mentions of tanks, bombs and guns. Although CBS declined to comment, an employee claimed that it was &quot;worried that the song might be seen as an anti-Iraq War statement&quot;.

==Bad Wolves cover==
The American heavy metal band Bad Wolves recorded a cover of &quot;Zombie&quot; in 2017 while they were working on their debut album &quot;Disobey&quot;. The band&#x27;s singer Tommy Vext slightly altered the lyrics, inserting a reference to drones and replacing &quot;since 1916&quot; with &quot;in 2018&quot; to show that times haven&#x27;t changed. Upon recording, the band were unsure regarding adding it to the album, with Vext declaring &quot;The song is a masterpiece and a massive hit. Some art is sacred—you become afraid to do a rendition of it&quot;. On 21 December 2017, Vext met Dan Waite—the Internal managing director of Bad Wolves&#x27; record label Eleven Seven Label Group-Europe and a long-time close friend of O&#x27;Riordan—backstage at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena at a heavy metal concert. Then he asked Waite to send her the cover for consideration as well as her approval for its release. Vext commented that &quot;I just got the courage to ask him to send her the song to see if she would approve of it. It&#x27;s always a jarring thing to take on someone&#x27;s piece of work: especially as The Cranberries were a massive band, and &#x27;Zombie&#x27; was probably their biggest song&quot;. On Christmas Eve 2017, Waite sent a text message to Vext that said O&#x27;Riordan had offered to &quot;sing on it&quot;. Vext described the situation as &quot;one of my childhood dreams come true&quot;, while the others musicians &quot;almost didn&#x27;t believe it&quot;.

On 14 January 2018, O&#x27;Riordan flew from her home in New York City to London. According to O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s agent, Lindsey Holmes, the primary purpose of her flight was for a studio mixing session on Monday and Tuesday with Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover for her side project&#x27;s second album, and she was also due to meet with The Cranberries&#x27; record label BMG. On 15 January 2018, at 1:12 am GMT at her Mayfair hotel in London, O&#x27;Riordan left a voice message to Waite, where she expressed her thoughts, describing the cover as &quot;awesome&quot;. She also invited Waite to come in the studio, slated for later that morning, and listen to the results of her vocals recording. O&#x27;Riordan was later found unresponsive in the hotel bathroom and confirmed dead at 09:16 am. Following her death, Bad Wolves said,

Bad Wolves released the cover on 18 January 2018. The cover topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in May 2018 for three weeks and peaked at No. 54 on the Hot 100. In June 2018, at a concert in New York City, Bad Wolves donated $250,000 to O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s children. The idea of making a donation was set up by Allen Kovac, Eleven Seven Label Group founder, and former manager of The Cranberries.

In an interview, bassist Kyle Konkiel shared his thoughts on the new cover&#x27;s sound:

===Music video===
The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Wayne Isham. It begins with text discussing the cover&#x27;s background and the passing of O&#x27;Riordan. The video then cuts to shots of the band performing the song in a black room, wearing black clothing and playing black instruments interspersed with close-up scenes of a woman (played by Ava Capra) being covered in gold paint to resemble O&#x27;Riordan in the original video. The woman also smears gold paint on a glass pane between herself and Vext, and after the guitar solo, she etches &quot;1-15-18&quot;, the date of O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s death, into the paint. The video ends with a quote by Vext, &quot;Her lyrics, confronting the collateral damage of political unrest, capture the same sentiment we wanted to express a quarter-century later. That is a testament to the kind of enduring artist Dolores was, and will remain forever.&quot;

<doc id="535267" wikidata="Q36188" url="?curid=535267" title="University of Fribourg">
<text>The University of Fribourg (; ) is a public university located in Fribourg, Switzerland.

The roots of the university can be traced back to 1580, when the notable Jesuit Peter Canisius founded the Collège Saint-Michel in the City of Fribourg. In 1763, an academy of law was founded by the state of Fribourg which formed the nucleus of the present law faculty. The University of Fribourg was finally created in 1889 by an Act of the parliament of the Swiss Canton of Fribourg.

The University of Fribourg is Switzerland&#x27;s only bilingual university and offers full curricula in both French and German, two of Switzerland&#x27;s national languages. Students number about 10,000; there are about 200 tenured professors and 700 other academic teaching and research personnel. The Misericorde Campus, constructed between 1939 and 1942, was designed by the architects Honegger and Dumas, students of Swiss architect Le Corbusier.

There are five faculties: Catholic theology, law, natural sciences, humanities, and economics &amp; social sciences.

==History==
The university owes its earliest origin to the foundation of the Jesuit College St. Michel on Belze Hill by Peter Canisius in 1580 at the invitation of the government of Fribourg. In 1763, an Academy of Law was founded, housed in the Albertinium (now a Dominican residence). In 1834, the cantonal library was formed from works brought to Fribourg (from Catholic monasteries) for safekeeping. The College St. Michel was closed following the expulsion of the Jesuits from Fribourg after the canton&#x27;s defeat in the Sonderbund war.
In 1886, Georges Python, founder of the cantonal bank and State Counsellor for Fribourg (M.P. in the upper house of the Swiss parliament) became Director of Public Education. He raised funds through a lottery and was
granted some 2,500,000 CHF by the canton. The cantonal library became integrated with that of the university and the academy became the Faculty of Law. In 1939, the university moved to a new campus constructed on the former cemetery of Misericorde, ceding St. Michel to one of Fribourg&#x27;s gymnasia, which took the name College St. Michel. During the Second World War, the university set up &quot;university camps&quot; along with the University of Zürich, Handels-Hochschule in St. Gallen and a Lycée camp at Wetzikon provided a wide variety of courses to educate Polish prisoners of war.

The Perolles campus was constructed on the site of a former wagon factory.

Although many lectures were originally in Latin, Fribourg is now the only French/German bilingual university in the world (45% French and 55% German). The town itself is 70% French and 30% German. This fact, coupled with the traditional dominance of French as the language of the city aristocracy explains why French has remained so dominant in university administration and in the AGEF (Association Générale des Etudiants Fribourgois), the Student&#x27;s Union. To commemorate the centenary of the university, La Poste issued a stamp depicting the figures Science and Sagesse.

==Recent developments==

In 2005, the university inaugurated its Perolles 2 campus, to which the Faculty of Economics and Social Science relocated. The university has the third largest collection of Biblical antiquities in the world after the British Museum and the Cairo Museum. Fribourg has also developed FriMat, a centre of excellence in nanotechnology. As part of the BeNeFri association comprising the Universities of Berne, Neuchâtel and Fribourg, students at any one of these universities may take courses at another in the association and still receive credit at their home institution. The academic degrees were the Demi-Licence, Licence, DEA / DESS, Doctorate. The university now follows the requirements of the Bologna process.

The University of Fribourg launched for the 2009–2010 academic year a new postgraduate law programme, the Master of Laws in Cross-Cultural Business Practice (MLCBP), an LL.M taught entirely in English.

==Campuses==
Fribourg has no central campus and its buildings are located throughout the city.
The main sites are:
*Misericorde - Humanities and central administration (including the famous Senate room)
*Perolles - Science
*Perolles 2 - Economics &amp; Social Sciences
*Regina Mundi - Psychology
*BCU centrale - Main Library (Cantonal and University Library of Fribourg)
*Pierre Aeby - Department of Classical Philology
*Bonnesfontaines - Pedagogy
*Stade St. Leonard - University Stadium

==Faculties==
The Fribourg University is divided into five faculties:

* The &quot;Faculty of Humanities&quot; is the largest faculty with about 4,600 students. They follow courses and seminars in the fields of philosophy, historical sciences, languages, literature, education, psychology or social sciences.
* The &quot;Faculty of Law&quot; has about 1,900 students. The program includes national and international law; both subjects areas can be followed bilingual.
* The &quot;Faculty of Theology&quot; is the largest and the most international of Switzerland, and, with Lucerne, it is the only state university in Switzerland to have a Faculty of Catholic Theology.
* Approximately 1,400 students are enrolled in one of the four Bachelor programmes and one of the seven Master programmes of the &quot;Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences&quot;. The faculty is composed of four departments: business management, economics, computer science, media and communication. In addition, the &quot;international institute of management in technology (iimt)&quot; and the &quot;Verbandsmanagement Institute (VMI)&quot; are attached to the Faculty.
* The &quot;Faculty of Science and Medicine&quot; was founded in 1896 and comprises seven departments: biology, chemistry, geosciences, computer science, mathematics, medicine and physics. These cover 14 fields: biochemistry, biology, chemistry, geography, computer science, human medicine and dentistry (Bachelor), mathematics, neuroscience, pharmacy, physics, biomedical sciences, environmental sciences, earth sciences (geology) and sport. The Adolphe Merkle Institute (AMI) is an interdisciplinary research institute of the Faculty of Sciences devoted to fundamental and application-oriented research and teaching in the domain of soft nanomaterials.

==Traditions==

The members of the university then proceed to the Aula Magna (Great Hall) in solemn procession. After an address by the rector and a prominent guest speaker, honorary degrees are awarded. The student guilds attend in ceremonial dress including swords.
*Corporations - These are similar to the Studentenverbindungen in Germany and Austria, but there is no de facto constraint to participate as it is in the student nations at the universities of Uppsala, Lund and Helsinki. They maintain Central European student traditions and meet at least once a week around a &quot;Stammtisch&quot; (&quot;regulars’ table&quot;) in order to socialise, drink and sing together. They tend to be organised on linguistic lines. One of them is still engaged in dueling, while the other corporations in Fribourg already rejected this tradition at the time they were founded, amongst others for religious reasons. Membership has often been considered advantageous for those wishing to pursue a career in business, politics or law. Most of Fribourg&#x27;s student corporations belong to the formerly Catholic &quot;Schweizerischer Studentenverein&quot;. An example is AV Fryburgia.
*The Day of Welcomes (&quot;Jour D’Accueil&quot;) - Similar to Freshers’ Week in anglophone universities. New students are invited to the Aula Magna, where they are welcomed to Fribourg by the Rector and the Syndic (Mayor of the City of Fribourg). This is followed by a meal in the university mensa provided by the city, where new students are expected to dine with the rest of the faculty to which they have been admitted.
*Every year, the Catholic Church holds collections during masses throughout Switzerland. Known as Fribourg Sunday, the funds raised are mainly used to award scholarships to foreign priests by the Faculty of Theology.

==Branding==

The university seal depicts a cross and bishop&#x27;s ring representing the university&#x27;s Catholic ethos on a shield of black and white, representing the canton of Fribourg. The logo of the university is a blue stylized &quot;F&quot; (with triangles echoing the facade structure of the Miséricorde Building and symbolizing the Alps) and the name of the university in Latin.

<doc id="535273" wikidata="Q697403" url="?curid=535273" title="Operation Plunder">
<text>Operation Plunder was a military operation to cross the Rhine on the night of 23 March 1945, launched by the 21st Army Group under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. The crossing of the river was at Rees, Wesel, and south of the river Lippe by the British Second Army under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey, and the United States Ninth Army under Lieutenant General William H. Simpson. 

The Battle of the Rhine was crucial for the Allied advance into Germany, and was planned by Montgomery as a three-army assault, including an airborne assault, a five-thousand-gun artillery barrage, and Anglo-American bombers. Thousands of tons of supplies were brought forward including huge amounts of bridging equipment. 

The First Allied Airborne Army conducted Operation Varsity on the east bank of the Rhine in support of Operation Plunder, consisting of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, the British 6th, and the U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions.

Operation Grenade in February by Simpson&#x27;s Ninth Army and Crerar&#x27;s Canadians was also expected to prepare the ground. 

Preparations such as accumulation of supplies, road construction, and the transport of 36 Royal Navy landing craft, were hidden by a massive smoke screen from 16 March. The operation commenced on the night of 23 March 1945. It included the &quot;Varsity&quot; parachute and glider landings near Wesel, and Operation Archway, by the Special Air Service.

==Battle==
Four thousand Allied guns fired for four hours during the opening bombardment. British bombers contributed with attacks on Wesel during the day and night of 23 March 1945.

On the night of 23 March, companies E and C of the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion, part of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division, constructed treadway rafts to prepare the crossing of the Rhine about five kilometers south of Wesel. Bridge construction started at 9:45 a.m. and by 4:00 p.m. the first truck crossed the floating pontoon bridge. Over of M2 treadway and 93 pneumatic floats were laid in the six hours and fifteen minute construction project, a record setting for the size of the bridge. It took twenty-five 2 ton GMC CCKW trucks to transport the bridge parts to the construction site, part of the Red Ball Express.

Three Allied formations made the initial assault: the British XII Corps and XXX Corps and the U.S. XVI Corps. The British 79th Armoured Division—under Major General Percy Hobart—had been at the front of the Normandy landings and provided invaluable help in subsequent operations with specially adapted armored vehicles (known as Hobart&#x27;s Funnies). One &quot;funny&quot; was the LVT-2 &quot;Buffalo&quot; operated by the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alan Jolly, an armed and armoured amphibious tracked personnel or cargo transporter, which was able to cross soft and flooded ground. These were the vehicles for the spearhead infantry.

The first part of &quot;Plunder&quot; within the framework of XXX Corp&#x27;s Operation Turnscrew was initiated by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, led by the 7th Battalion, Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of 154th Brigade at 21:00 on 23 March, near Rees, followed by the 7th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (also of 154th Brigade). At 02:00 on 24 March, the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division landed between Wesel and Rees. At first, there was no opposition, but later they ran into determined resistance from machine-gun nests. On the same day the 51st Division&#x27;s commander, Major-General Tom Rennie, was killed by mortar fire. The British 1st Commando Brigade entered Wesel.

The U.S. 30th Infantry Division landed south of Wesel. The local resistance had been broken by artillery and air bombardment. Subsequently, the U.S. 79th Infantry Division also landed. American casualties were minimal. German resistance to the British landings continued with some effect, and there were armored counter-attacks. Landings continued, however, including tanks and other heavy equipment. U.S. forces had a bridge across by the evening of 24 March.

Operation Varsity started at 10:00 on 24 March, to disrupt enemy communications. Despite heavy resistance to the airdrops and afterward, the airborne troops made progress and repelled counterattacks. The hard lessons of Operation Market Garden were applied. In the afternoon, the 15th (Scottish) Division linked up with both airborne divisions.

Fierce German resistance continued around Bienen, north of Rees, where the entire 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade was needed to relieve the Black Watch. The bridgehead was firmly established, however, and Allied advantages in numbers and equipment were applied. By 27 March, the bridgehead was wide and deep.

==Aftermath==

===Impact on German forces and command===
The Allied operation was opposed by the German 1st Parachute Army, commanded by Alfred Schlemm, a part of Army Group H. Although this formation was considered to be the most effective German force in the area, it was severely depleted from its previous action in the Battle of the Reichswald. Unable to withstand Allied pressure, the 1st Parachute Army withdrew northeast toward Hamburg and Bremen, leaving a gap between it and the 15th Army in the Ruhr.

Joseph Goebbels was well aware of Plunder&#x27;s potential impact from the beginning. On 24 March, he began his diary entry with, &quot;The situation in the West has entered an extraordinarily critical, ostensibly almost deadly, phase.&quot; He went on to note the crossing of the Rhine on a broad front, and foresaw Allied attempts to encircle the Ruhr industrial heartland.

On 27 March, command of the 1st Parachute Army was passed to Günther Blumentritt, because Schlemm had been wounded. Blumentritt and his superior, Johannes Blaskowitz, both recognised that the situation was lost. The army&#x27;s front was incomplete, there were no reserves, weak artillery, no air support and few tanks. Communications were weak, indeed, one corps was never contacted. The reinforcements were so poor that the generals decided against using them, to avoid needless casualties.

Although Blumentritt had strict orders from Supreme Command to hold and fight, from 1 April, he managed a withdrawal with minimal casualties, eventually withdrawing beyond the Dortmund-Ems Canal to the Teutoburg Forest. Within a week of the start of &quot;Plunder&quot;, the Allies had taken 30,000 prisoners of war north of the Ruhr.

===Winston Churchill===

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was present at Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s headquarters near Venlo on the eve of &quot;Plunder&quot;. Subsequently, Churchill and Montgomery watched the &quot;Varsity&quot; air landings on 24 March.

The next day, 25 March, Churchill and Montgomery visited General Dwight D. Eisenhower′s headquarters. After lunch and a briefing, the party went to a sandbagged house overlooking the Rhine and a quiet, undefended stretch of the German-held riverbank. After Eisenhower&#x27;s departure, Churchill, Montgomery, and a party of U.S. commanders and armed guards took a LCVP landing craft and landed for 30 minutes in enemy territory, without challenge. They next visited the destroyed railway bridge at Wesel, departing when German artillery appeared to target them.

===Military rivalries===
The Plunder crossings in the third week of March were planned as the primary assault across the Rhine, but at the Yalta Conference in early February 1945, it was decided to add another crossing to the south of the Ruhr. The additional crossing was intended to draw off any concentration of forces in opposition to Plunder. Two earlier crossings actually happened.

On 7 March, U.S. troops unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge as a result of the Battle of Remagen. Within the next 10 days six divisions and 25,000 troops established a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine.

On 22 March, General George S. Patton sent his Third Army across the Rhine, at Nierstein, to form another bridgehead. His superior, General Omar Bradley, released news of this crossing to the press &quot;at a time calculated to take some of the lustre from the news of Montgomery′s crossing&quot;.
Bradley later remembered that Patton had strongly urged the announcement saying &quot;I want the world to know that Third Army made it before Monty starts across&quot;.

<text>Dow Mossman (born 1943 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa) is an American writer, known for his novel &quot;The Stones of Summer&quot;.

==Life and career==
Dow Mossman studied at Coe College for two years, finished college at the University of Iowa and received his Master of Fine Arts from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop in 1969. 

His novel &quot;The Stones of Summer&quot; was published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1972 and Popular Library a year later. Following the publication of the novel, Mossman was mentally exhausted and spent several months in an Iowa sanitorium. The novel soon went out of print. One element of the novel is poems and letters from Vietnam sent by Marine officer Dan Guenther (U.of Iowa, MFA, 1973), who later published the novels &quot;China Wind&quot; (Ivy, 1990) and &quot;Dodge City Blues&quot; (Redburn Press, 2007).

===&quot;Stone Reader&quot;===
In 2002, Mossman was the subject of the documentary film &quot;Stone Reader&quot; by Mark Moskowitz, which chronicled the director&#x27;s attempt to resuscitate the acclaimed book and speak to its seemingly vanished author.

The film shows Mossman currently living in the home he grew up in, which is filled with books. According to the film, Mossman writes on the porch, and is currently working on a book based on notes he has taken from watching hundreds of old movies. In addition to that book, he is also working on a book of poetry.

Prior to &quot;Stone Reader&quot;, Mossman had been employed for 19 years as a welder, before quitting his job to look after his aging mother until her death, after which he returned to work as a paper bundler for the local newspaper. After the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The Stones of Summer&quot; was re-published by Barnes &amp; Noble. He is now semi-retired.

<doc id="535282" wikidata="Q2336445" url="?curid=535282" title="Rise of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] is a period of history that started with the emergence of the Ottoman principality (Turkish: &quot;Osmanlı Beyliği&quot;) in , and ended . This period witnessed the foundation of a political entity ruled by the Ottoman Dynasty in the northwestern Anatolian region of Bithynia, and its transformation from a small principality on the Byzantine frontier into an empire spanning the Balkans, Anatolia, Middle East and North Africa. For this reason, this period in the empire&#x27;s history has been described as the &quot;Proto-Imperial Era&quot;. Throughout most of this period, the Ottomans were merely one of many competing states in the region, and relied upon the support of local warlords Ghazis and vassals (Beys) to maintain control over their realm. By the middle of the fifteenth century the Ottoman sultans were able to accumulate enough personal power and authority to establish a centralized imperial state, a process which was achieved by Sultan Mehmed II (). The conquest of Constantinople in 1453 is seen as the symbolic moment when the emerging Ottoman state shifted from a mere principality into an empire therefore marking a major turning point in its history.

The cause of Ottoman success cannot be attributed to any single factor, and they varied throughout the period as the Ottomans continually adapted to changing circumstances.

The earlier part of this period, the fourteenth century, is particularly difficult for historians to study due to the scarcity of sources. Not a single written document survives from the reign of Osman I, and very little survives from the rest of the century. The Ottomans, furthermore, did not begin to record their own history until the fifteenth century, more than a hundred years after many of the events they describe. It is thus a great challenge for historians to differentiate between fact and myth in analyzing the stories contained in these later chronicles, so much so that one historian has even declared it impossible, describing the earliest period of Ottoman history as a &quot;black hole&quot;.

Turkish historian Halil Inalcik has emphasized the importance of religious zeal—expressed through jihad—as a primary motivation for the conquests of the Ottomans: “The ideal of gaza, holy war, was an important factor in the foundation and development of the Ottoman state. Society in the frontier principalities conformed to a particular cultural pattern imbued with the ideal of continuous Holy War and continuous expansion of the Dar ul Islam—the realms of Islam—until they covered the whole world.” This is known as the Gaza Thesis, a now largely discredited theory of early Ottoman expansion.

==Anatolia before the Ottomans==

After the Battle of Manzikert (1071) Anatolia was divided between two relatively powerful states: the Byzantine Empire in the west and the Anatolian Seljuks in the central plateau. Equilibrium between them was disrupted by the Mongol invasion and conquest of the Seljuks following the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, and the reconquest of Constantinople by the Byzantine Palaiologos dynasty in 1261, which shifted Byzantine attention away from the Anatolian frontier. Mongol pressure pushed nomadic Turkish tribes to migrate westward, into the now poorly-defended Byzantine territory. For the next two centuries, Anatolian Beyliks were under the suzerainty of the Mongols, especially the Ilkhanate. All coins minted during this period in Anatolia show Ilkhanate rulers. From the 1260s onward Anatolia increasingly began to slip from Byzantine control, as Turkish Anatolian beyliks were established both in formerly Byzantine lands and in the territory of the fragmenting Seljuk Sultanate.

Political authority in western Anatolia was thus extremely fragmented by the end of the thirteenth century, split between locally established rulers, tribal groups, holy figures, and warlords, with Byzantine and Seljuk authority ever present but rapidly weakening. The fragmentation of authority has led several historians to describe the political entities of thirteenth and fourteenth-century Anatolia as Taifas, or &quot;petty kings&quot;, a comparison with the history of late-medieval Muslim Spain. The power of these groups was largely dependent upon their ability to attract military manpower. Western Anatolia was then a hotbed of raiding activity, with warriors switching allegiance at will to whichever chief seemed most able to provide them with opportunities for plunder and glory.

==Origin of the Ottoman state==
The Ottoman dynasty is named after the first ruler of the Ottoman polity, Osman I. According to later Ottoman tradition, he was descended from a Turkic tribe which migrated out of Central Asia in the wake of the Mongol Conquests. As evidenced by coins minted during his reign, Osman&#x27;s father was named Ertuğrul, but beyond this the details &quot;are too mythological to be taken for granted.&quot;

The origin of the Ottoman dynasty isn&#x27;t known for sure but it is known that it was established by Turks from Central Asia, who migrated to Anatolia and were under Mongol suzerainty.

Likewise, nothing is known about how Osman first established his principality (&quot;beylik&quot;) as the sources, none of them contemporary, provide many different and conflicting origin stories. What is certain is that at some point in the late thirteenth century Osman emerged as the leader of a small principality centered on the town of Söğüt in the north-western Anatolian region of Bithynia. The emergence of Osman as a leader is marked by him issuing coins in his name, unlike his predecessors in the last two centuries who issued coins in the name of the Illkhanates. Osman&#x27;s principality was initially supported by the tribal manpower of nomadic Turkish groups, whom he led in raids against the Byzantine territories of the region. This Ottoman tribe was based not on blood-ties, but on political expedience. Thus it was inclusive of all who wished to join, including people of Byzantine origin. The Ottoman enterprise came to be led by several great warrior families, including the family of Köse Mihal, which had a Greek Christian origin
and the family of Hranislav, which was Bulgarian. Islam and Persian culture were part of Ottoman self-identity from the start, as evidenced by a land grant issued by Osman&#x27;s son Orhan in 1324, describing him as &quot;Champion of the Faith&quot;.

===Gaza and gazis in early Ottoman history===

In 1938 the Austrian historian Paul Wittek published an influential work entitled &quot;The Rise of the Ottoman Empire&quot;, in which he put forth the argument that the early Ottoman state was constructed upon an ideology of Islamic holy war against non-Muslims. Such a war was known as &quot;gaza&quot;, and a warrior fighting in it was called a &quot;gazi&quot;. Wittek&#x27;s formulation, subsequently known as the &quot;Gaza Thesis,&quot; was influential for much of the twentieth century, and led historians to portray the early Ottomans as zealous religious warriors dedicated to the spread of Islam. Beginning in the 1980s, historians increasingly criticized Wittek&#x27;s thesis. Scholars now recognize that the terms &quot;gaza&quot; and &quot;gazi&quot; did not have strictly religious connotations for the early Ottomans, and were often used in a secular sense to simply refer to raids. Additionally, the early Ottomans were neither strict orthodox Muslims nor were they unwilling to cooperate with non-Muslims, and several of the companions of the first Ottoman rulers were either non-Muslims or recent converts. The idea of holy war existed during the fourteenth century, but it was only one of many factors influencing Ottoman behavior. It was only later, in the fifteenth century, that Ottoman writers retroactively began to portray the early Ottomans as zealous Islamic warriors, in order to provide a noble origin for their dynasty which, by then, had constructed an intercontinental Islamic empire.

==Demography==
Anatolia and the Balkans were greatly impacted by the arrival of the Black Death after 1347. Urban centers and settled regions were devastated, while nomadic groups suffered less of an impact. The first Ottoman incursions into the Balkans began shortly thereafter. Depopulation resulting from the plague was thus almost certainly a major factor in the success of early Ottoman expansion into the Balkans, and contributed to the weakening of the Byzantine Empire and the depopulation of Constantinople.

==Government==

During this early period, before the Ottomans were able to establish a centralized system of government in the middle of the fifteenth century, the rulers&#x27; powers were &quot;far more circumscribed, and depended heavily upon coalitions of support and alliances reached&quot; among various power-holders within the empire, including Turkic tribal leaders and Balkan allies and vassals.

When the Ottoman polity first emerged at the end of the thirteenth century under the leadership of Osman I, it had a tribal organization without a complex administrative apparatus. As Ottoman territory expanded, its rulers were faced with the challenge of administering an ever-larger population. Early on, the Ottomans adopted the Seljuks of Rum as models for administration and the Illkhanates as models for military warfare, and by 1324 were able to produce Persian-language bureaucratic documents in the Seljuk style.

The early Ottoman state&#x27;s expansion was fueled by the military activity of frontier warriors (), of whom the Ottoman ruler was initially merely &quot;primus inter pares&quot;. Much of the state&#x27;s centralization was carried out in opposition to these frontier warriors, who resented Ottoman efforts to control them. Ultimately, the Ottomans managed to harness &quot;gazi&quot; military power while increasingly subordinating them.

The early Ottomans were noteworthy for the low tax rates which they imposed on their subjects. This reflected both an ideological concern for the well-being of their subjects, and also a pragmatic need to earn the loyalty of newly conquered populations. In the fifteenth century, the Ottoman state became more centralized and the tax burden increased, prompting criticism from writers.

An important factor in Ottoman success was their ability to preserve the empire across generations. Other Turkic groups frequently divided their realms between the sons of a deceased ruler. The Ottomans consistently kept the empire united under a single heir.

===State centralization===

The process of centralization is closely connected with an influx of Muslim scholars from Central Anatolia, where a more urban and bureaucratic Turkish civilization had developed under the Seljuks of Rum. Particularly influential was the Çandarlı family, which supplied several Grand Viziers to the early Ottomans and influenced their institutional development. Some time after 1376, Kara Halil, the head of the Çandarlı family, encouraged Murad I to institute a tax of one-fifth on slaves taken in war, known as the &quot;pençik&quot;. This gave the Ottoman rulers a source of manpower from which they could construct a new personal army, known as the Janissaries (&quot;yeniçeri&quot;). Such measures frustrated the &quot;gazi&quot;, who sustained Ottoman military conquests, and created lasting tensions within the state. It was also during the reign of Murad I that the office of military judge (&quot;Kazasker&quot;) was created, indicating an increasing level of social stratification between the emerging military-administrative class (&quot;askeri&quot;) and the rest of society. Murad I also instituted the practice of appointing specific frontier warriors as &quot;Lords of the Frontier&quot; (&quot;uc begleri&quot;). Such power of appointment indicates that the Ottoman rulers were no longer merely &quot;primus inter pares&quot;. As a way of openly declaring this new status, Murad became the first Ottoman ruler to adopt the title of sultan.

Beginning in the 1430s, but most likely earlier, the Ottomans conducted regular cadastral surveys of the territory under their rule, producing record-books known as &quot;tahrir defter&quot;s. These surveys enabled the Ottoman state to organize the distribution of agricultural taxation rights to the military class of timariots, cavalrymen who collected revenue from the land in exchange for serving in the Ottoman army. Timariots came from diverse backgrounds. Some achieved their position as a reward for military service, while others were descended from the Byzantine aristocracy and simply continued to collect revenue from their old lands, now serving in the Ottoman army as well. Of the latter, many were converts to Islam, while others remained Christian.

Of great symbolic importance for Ottoman centralization was the practice of Ottoman rulers to stand upon hearing martial music, indicating their willingness to participate in &quot;gaza&quot;. Shortly after the Conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II discontinued this practice, indicating that the Ottoman ruler was no longer a simple frontier warrior, but the sovereign of an empire. The empire&#x27;s capital shifted from Edirne, the city symbolically connected with the frontier warrior ethos of &quot;gaza&quot;, to Constantinople, a city with deeply imperial connotations due to its long history as the capital of the Byzantine Empire. This was seen, both symbolically and practically, as the moment of the empire&#x27;s definitive shift from a frontier principality into an empire.

==Military==

Osman&#x27;s army at the beginning of the fourteenth century consisted largely of mounted warriors. These he used in raids, ambushes, and hit-and-run attacks, allowing him to control the countryside of Bithynia. However, he initially lacked the means to conduct sieges. Bursa, the first major town conquered by the Ottomans, surrendered under threat of starvation following a long blockade rather than from an assault. It was under Orhan (r. 1323/4-1362) and Murad I (r. 1362-1389) that the Ottomans mastered the techniques of siege warfare.

The warriors in Osman&#x27;s service came from diverse backgrounds. Known variously as &quot;gazi&quot;s and (raiders), they were attracted to his success and joined out of a desire to win plunder and glory. Most of Osman&#x27;s early followers were Muslim Turks of tribal origin, while others were of Byzantine origin, either Christians or recent converts to Islam.

The Ottomans began employing gunpowder weapons in the 1380s at the latest. By the 1420s they were regularly using cannons in siege warfare. Cannons were also used for fortress defense, and shore batteries allowed the Ottomans to bypass a Crusader blockade of the Dardanelles in 1444. By that time, handheld firearms had also come into use, and were adopted by some of the janissaries.

==Cultural and intellectual life==

By the early fifteenth century, the Ottoman court was actively fostering literary output, much of it borrowing from the longstanding literary tradition of other Islamic courts further east. The first extant account of Ottoman history ever written was produced by the poet Ahmedi, originally meant to be presented to Sultan Bayezid I but, following the latter&#x27;s death in 1402, written for his son Süleyman Çelebi instead. This work, entitled the &quot;İskendernāme,&quot; (&quot;The Book of Alexander&quot;) was part of a genre known as &quot;mirror for princes&quot; (&quot;naṣīḥatnāme&quot;), meant to provide advice and guidance to the ruler with regard to statecraft. Thus rather than providing a factual account of the dynasty&#x27;s history, Ahmedi&#x27;s goal was to indirectly criticize the sultan by depicting his ancestors as model rulers, in contrast to the perceived deviance of Bayezid. Specifically, Ahmedi took issue with Bayezid&#x27;s military campaigns against fellow Muslims in Anatolia, and thus depicted his ancestors as totally devoted to holy war against the Christian states of the Balkans.

==Political history==

===Osman I (c. 1299–1323/4)===

Osman&#x27;s origins are extremely obscure, and almost nothing is known about his career before the beginning of the fourteenth century. The date of 1299 is frequently given as the beginning of his reign, however this date does not correspond with any historical event, and is purely symbolic. By 1300 he had become the leader of a group of Turkish pastoral tribes, through which he ruled over a small territory around the town of Söğüt in the north-western Anatolian region of Bithynia. He led frequent raids against the neighboring Byzantine Empire. Success attracted warriors to his following, particularly after his victory over a Byzantine army in the Battle of Bapheus in 1301 or 1302. Osman&#x27;s military activity was largely limited to raiding because, by the time of his death, in 1323-4, the Ottomans had not yet developed effective techniques for siege warfare. Although he is famous for his raids against the Byzantines, Osman also had many military confrontations with Tatar groups and with the neighboring principality of Germiyan.

Osman was adept at forging political and commercial relationships with nearby groups, Muslim as well as Christian. Early on, he attracted several notable figures to his side, including Köse Mihal, a Byzantine village headman whose descendants (known as the Mihaloğulları) enjoyed primacy among the frontier warriors in Ottoman service. Köse Mihal was noteworthy for having been a Christian Greek; while he eventually converted to Islam, his prominent historical role indicates Osman&#x27;s willingness to cooperate with non-Muslims and to incorporate them in his political enterprise.

Osman I strengthened his legitimacy by marrying the daughter of Sheikh Edebali, a prominent local religious leader who was said to have been at the head of a community of dervishes on the frontier. Later Ottoman writers embellished this event by depicting Osman as having experienced a dream while staying with Edebali, in which it was foretold that his descendants would rule over a vast empire.

===Orhan (1323/4–1362)===
Upon Osman&#x27;s death his son Orhan succeeded him as leader of the Ottomans. Orhan oversaw the conquest of Bithynia&#x27;s major towns, as Bursa (Prusa) was conquered in 1326 and the rest of the region&#x27;s towns fell shortly thereafter. Already by 1324, the Ottomans were making use of Seljuk bureaucratic practices, and had developed the capacity to mint coins and utilize siege tactics. It was under Orhan that the Ottomans began to attract Islamic scholars from the east to act as administrators and judges, and the first medrese (University) was established in Iznik in 1331.

In addition to fighting the Byzantines, Orhan also conquered the Turkish principality of Karesi in 1345-6, thus placing all potential crossing points to Europe in Ottoman hands. The experienced Karesi warriors were incorporated into the Ottoman military, and were a valuable asset in subsequent campaigns into the Balkans.

Orhan married Theodora, the daughter of Byzantine prince John VI Cantacuzenus. In 1346 Orhan openly supported John VI in the overthrowing of the emperor John V Palaeologus. When John VI became co-emperor (1347–1354) he allowed Orhan to raid the peninsula of Gallipoli in 1352, after which the Ottomans gained their first permanent stronghold in Europe at Çimpe Castle in 1354. Orhan decided to pursue war against Europe, Anatolian Turks were settled in and around Gallipoli to secure it as a springboard for military operations in Thrace against the Byzantines and Bulgarians. Most of eastern Thrace was overrun by Ottoman forces within a decade and was permanently brought under Orhan&#x27;s control by means of heavy colonization. The initial Thracian conquests placed the Ottomans strategically astride all of the major overland communication routes linking Constantinople to the Balkan frontiers, facilitating their expanded military operations. ln addition, control of the highways in Thrace isolated Byzantium from direct overland contact with any of its potential allies in the Balkans and in Western Europe. Byzantine Emperor John V was forced to sign an unfavorable treaty with Orhan in 1356 that recognized his Thracian losses. For the next 50 years, the Ottomans went on to conquer vast territories in the Balkans, reaching as far north as modern-day Serbia.

In taking control over the passageways to Europe, the Ottomans gained a significant advantage over their rival Turkish principalities in Anatolia, as they now could gain immense prestige and wealth from conquests carried out on the Balkan frontier.

===Murad I (1362–1389)===

Soon after Orhan&#x27;s death in 1362, Murad I became Sultan.

====Edirne, 1362====
Murad&#x27;s first major offensive was the conquest of the Byzantine city of Adrianople in 1362. He renamed it to Edirne and made it his new capital in 1363. By transferring his capital from Bursa in Anatolia to that newly won city in Thrace, Murad signaled his intentions to continue Ottoman expansion in Southeast Europe. Before the conquest of Edirne, most Christian Europeans regarded the Ottoman presence in Thrace as merely the latest unpleasant episode in a long string of chaotic events in the Balkans. After Murad I designated Edirne as his capital, they realized that the Ottomans intended to remain in Europe.

The Balkan states of Byzantium, Bulgaria, and Serbia were frightened by Ottoman conquests in Thrace, and were ill-prepared to deal with the threat. Byzantine territory was reduced and fragmented. It consisted mostly of the capital, Constantinople and its Thracian environs, the city of Thessaloniki and its immediate surroundings, and the Despotate of the Morea in the Peloponnese. Contact between Constantinople and the two other regions was only feasible via a tenuous sea route through the Dardanelles, kept open by the Italian maritime powers of Venice and Genoa. The weakened Byzantine Empire no longer possessed the resources to defeat Murad on its own. Concerted action on the part of the Byzantines, often divided by civil war, was impossible. The survival of Constantinople itself depended on its legendary defensive walls, the lack of an Ottoman navy, and the willingness of Murad to honor provisions in the 1356 treaty, which permitted the city to be provisioned.

Bulgaria under Tsar Ivan Aleksandar was expanding and prosperous. However, at the end of his rule, the Bulgarian Tsar made the fatal mistake to divide the Second Bulgarian Empire into three appanages held by his sons. Bulgaria&#x27;s cohesion was shattered further in the 1350s by a rivalry between the holder of Vidin, Ivan Sratsimir, Ivan Aleksandar&#x27;s sole surviving son by his first wife, and Ivan Shishman, the product of Aleksandar&#x27;s second marriage and the &quot;tsar&#x27;s&quot; designated successor. In addition to internal problems, Bulgaria was further crippled by a Hungarian attack. In 1365 Hungarian King Louis I invaded and seized Vidin province, whose ruler Ivan Sratsimir was taken captive. Despite the concurrent loss of most Bulgarian Thracian holdings to Murad, Ivan Aleksandar became fixated on the Hungarians in Vidin. He formed a coalition against them with the Bulgarian ruler of Dobrudja Dobrotitsa and Voievod Vladislav I Vlaicu of Wallachia. Although the Hungarians were repulsed and Ivan Sratsimir restored to his throne, Bulgaria emerged more intensely divided. Ivan Sratsimir proclaimed himself tsar of an &quot;Empire&quot; of Vidin in 1370, and Dobrotitsa received de facto recognition as independent despot in Dobrudzha. Bulgaria&#x27;s efforts were squandered to little domestic purpose and against the wrong enemy.

Given Serbia&#x27;s preeminence in the Balkans under Tsar Stefan Dušan, its rapid dissolution following his death in 1355 was dramatic. The powerful regional Serb nobles demonstrated little respect for his successor, Stefan Uroš V. Young, weak Uroš was incapable of ruling as his father had. The separatist-minded &quot;bojars&quot; were quick to take advantage of the situation, and Serbia fragmented.

First to throw off Serbian control were the Greek provinces of Thessaly and Epiros as well as Dušan&#x27;s former Albanian holdings. A series of small independent principalities arose in western and southern Macedonia, while the Hungarians encroached deeper into Serb lands in the north. Uros held only the core Serbian lands, whose nobles, although more powerful than their prince, generally remained loyal. These core lands consisted of: The western lands, including Montenegro (Zeta); the southern lands, held by Jovan Uglješa in Serres, encompassing all of eastern Macedonia; and the central Serbian lands, stretching from the Danube south into central Macedonia, co-ruled by Uroš and the powerful noble Vukasin Mrnjavcevic, who held Prilep in Macedonia. Far from preserving Serb unity, Uroš&#x27;s loosely amalgamated domains were wracked by constant civil war among the regional nobles, leaving Serbia vulnerable to the rising Ottoman threat.
Murad I did rise to the power of the Ottoman Empire in 1362.

====Gallipoli, 1366====
By 1370 Murad controlled most of Thrace, bringing him into direct contact with Bulgaria and the southeastern Serbian lands ruled by Uglješa. Uglješa, the most powerful Serb regional ruler, unsuccessfully attempted to forge an anti-Ottoman alliance of Balkan states in 1371. Byzantium, vulnerable to the Turks because of its food supply situation, refused to cooperate. Bulgaria, following Ivan Aleksandar&#x27;s death early that year, lay officially divided into the &quot;Empire&quot; of Vidin, ruled by Stratsimir (1370–96), and Aleksandar&#x27;s direct successor Tsar Ivan Shishman (1371–95), who ruled central Bulgaria from Turnovo. Young, his hold on the throne unsteady, threatened by Stratsimir, and probably pressured by the Turks, Shishman could not afford to participate in Uglješa&#x27;s scheme. Of the regional Serb &quot;bojars&quot;, only Vukašin, protector of Uroš and Uglješa&#x27;s brother, joined in the effort. The others either failed to recognize the Ottoman danger or refused to participate lest competitors attacked while they were in the field.

====Maritsa, 1371====


The Battle of Maritsa took place at the Maritsa River near the village of Chernomen on September 26, 1371 with sultan Murad&#x27;s lieutenant Lala Shahin Pasha and the Serbs numbering some 70,000 men under the command of the Serbian king of Prilep Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his brother despot Uglješa. Despot Uglješa wanted to make a surprise attack in their capital city, Edirne, while Murad I was in Asia Minor. The Ottoman army was much smaller, but due to superior tactics (night raid on the allied camp), Şâhin Paşa was able to defeat the Christian army and kill King Vukašin and despot Uglješa. Macedonia and parts of Greece fell under Ottoman power after this battle. Both Uglješa and Vukašin perished in the carnage. So overwhelming was the Ottoman victory that the Turks referred to the battle as the Rout (or Destruction) of the Serbs.

What little unity Serbia possessed collapsed after the catastrophe at Ormenion (Chernomen). Uroš died before the year was out, ending the Nemanjić dynasty, and large areas of central Serbia broke away as independent principalities, reducing it to half of its former size. No future ruler ever again officially held the office of &quot;car&quot;, and no single &quot;bojar&quot; enjoyed enough power or respect to gain recognition as a unifying leader. Vukasin&#x27;s son, Marko, survived the slaughter and proclaimed himself Serbian &quot;king&quot; (&quot;kralj&quot;) but was unable to enforce his claim beyond his lands around Prilep, in central Macedonia. Serbia slipped into accelerated fragmentation and internecine warfare among the proliferating regional princes.

In the aftermath of the Ormenion battle, Ottoman raids into Serbia and Bulgaria intensified. The enormity of the victory and the incessant raids into his lands convinced Turnovo Bulgarian Tsar Shishman of the necessity for coming to terms with the Ottomans. By 1376 at the latest, Shishman accepted vassal status under Murad and sent his sister as the sultan&#x27;s &quot;wife&quot; to the harem at Edirne. The arrangement did not prevent Ottoman raiders from continuing to plunder inside Shishman&#x27;s borders. As for Byzantium, Emperor John V definitively accepted Ottoman vassalage soon after the battle, opening the door to Murad&#x27;s direct interference in Byzantine domestic politics.

The Bulgarians and Serbs enjoyed a brief respite during the 1370s and into the 1380s when matters in Anatolia and increased meddling in Byzantium&#x27;s political affairs kept Murad preoccupied. In Serbia, the lull permitted the northern Serb ‘’bojar’’ Prince Lazar Hrebeljanovic (1371-89), with the support of powerful Bulgarian and Montenegrin nobles and the backing of the Serbian Orthodox Patriarchate of Pec, to consolidate control over much of the core Serbian lands. Most of the Serb regional rulers in Macedonia, including Marko, accepted vassalage under Murad to preserve their positions, and many of them led Serb forces in the sultan&#x27;s army operating in Anatolia against his Turkish rivals.

====Dubravnica, 1381====

By the mid-1380s Murad&#x27;s attention once again focused on the Balkans. With his Bulgarian vassal Shishman preoccupied by a war with Wallachian Voievod Dan I of Wallachia (ca. 1383-86), in 1385 Murad took Sofia, the last remaining Bulgarian possession south of the Balkan Mountains, opening the way toward strategically located Niš, the northern terminus of the important Vardar-Morava highway.

====Saurian Field, 1385====
Savra field battle was fought on 18 September 1385 between Ottoman and Serbian forces. The Ottomans were victorious and most of the local Serbian and Albanian lords became vassals.

====Plocnik, 1386====

Murad captured Niš in 1386, perhaps forcing Lazar of Serbia to accept Ottoman vassalage soon afterward. While he pushed deeper into the north—central Balkans, Murad also had forces moving west along the ‘’Via Ingatia’’ into Macedonia, forcing vassal status on regional rulers who until that time had escaped that fate. One contingent reached the Albanian Adriatic coast in 1385. Another took and occupied Thessaloniki in 1387. The danger to the continued independence of the Balkan Christian states grew alarmingly apparent.

When Anatolian affairs forced Murad to leave the Balkans in 1387, his Serbian and Bulgarian vassals attempted to sever their ties to him. Lazar formed a coalition with Tvrtko I of Bosnia and Stratsimir of Vidin. After he refused an Ottoman demand that he live up to his vassal obligations, troops were dispatched against him. Lazar and Tvrtko met the Turks and defeated them at Plocnik, west of Niš. The victory by his fellow Christian princes encouraged Shishman to shed Ottoman vassalage and reassert Bulgarian independence.

====Bileća, 1388====

Murad returned from Anatolia in 1388 and launched a lightning campaign against the Bulgarian rulers Shishman and Sratsimir, who swiftly were forced into vassal submission. He then demanded that Lazar proclaim his vassalage and pay tribute. Confident because of the victory at Plocnik, the Serbian prince refused and turned to Tvrtko of Bosnia and Vuk Brankovic, his son-in-law and independent ruler of northern Macedonia and Kosovo, for aid against the certain Ottoman retaliatory offensive.

====Kosovo, 1389====
On St. Vitus&#x27; Day, June 15, 1389, the Ottoman army, personally commanded by Sultan Murad, fought the Serbian army led by Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, which also included contingents led by Vuk Branković, and a contingent sent from Bosnia by King Tvrtko I, commanded by Vlatko Vuković. Estimates of army sizes vary, with the Ottomans having greater numbers (27,000–40,000) than the Orthodox army (12,000–30,000). The battle resulted in a draw. Both armies were mostly wiped out. Both Lazar and Murad lost their lives. Although the Ottomans managed to annihilate the Serbian army, they also suffered high casualties which delayed their progress. The Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, one after the other, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals became so in the following years. The Battle of Kosovo is particularly important to modern Serbian history, tradition, and national identity. Lazar&#x27;s young and weak successor Stefan Lazarević (1389–1427) concluded a vassal agreement with Bayezid in 1390 to counter Hungarian moves into northern Serbia, while Vuk Branković, the last independent Serb prince, held out until 1392.

===Bayezid I (1389–1402)===
Bayezid I (often given the epithet &quot;Yıldırım&quot;, &quot;the Thunderbolt&quot;) succeeded to the sultanship upon the assassination of his father Murad. In a rage over the attack, he ordered all Serbian captives killed; Beyazid became known as &quot;Yıldırım&quot;, the lightning bolt, for the speed with which his empire expanded.

Bayezid, &quot;the Thunderbolt&quot;, lost little time in expanding Ottoman Balkan conquests. He followed up on his victory by raiding throughout Serbia and southern Albania, forcing most of the local princes into vassalage. Both to secure the southern stretch of the Vardar-Morava highway and to establish a firm base for permanent expansion westward to the Adriatic coast, Bayezid settled large numbers of ‘’yürüks’’ along the Vardar River valley in Macedonia.

The appearance of Turk raiders at Hungary&#x27;s southern borders awakened the Hungarian King Sigismund of Luxemburg (1387–1437) to the danger that the Ottomans posed to his kingdom, and he sought out Balkan allies for a new anti-Ottoman coalition.

By early 1393 Turnovo Bulgaria&#x27;s Ivan Shishman, hoping to throw off his onerous vassalage, was in secret negotiations with Sigismund, along with Wallachian Voievod Mircea the Old (1386–1418) and, possibly, Vidin&#x27;s Ivan Sratsimir. Bayezid got wind of the talks and launched a devastating campaign against Shishman. Turnovo was captured after a lengthy siege, and Shishman fled to Nikopol. When that town fell to Bayezid, Shishman was captured and beheaded. All his lands were annexed by the sultan, and Sratsimir, whose Vidin holdings had escaped Bayezid&#x27;s wrath, was forced to reaffirm his vassalage.

Having dealt harshly and effectively with his disloyal Bulgarian vassals, Bayezid then turned his attention south to Thessaly and the Morea, whose Greek lords had accepted Ottoman vassalage in the 1380s. Their incessant bickering among themselves, especially those of the Greek Morean magnates, required Bayezid&#x27;s intervention. He summoned a meeting of all his Balkan vassals at Serres in 1394 to settle these and other outstanding matters. Among the sultan&#x27;s attending vassals were the Thessalian and Morean nobles, Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1391–1425), and Serbian Prince Lazarevic. At the meeting, Bayezid acquired possession of all disputed territories, and all of the attendees were required to reaffirm their vassal status.

When the Moreans later reneged on their Serres agreement with Bayezid, the angered Ottoman ruler blockaded the Morean despot&#x27;s imperial brother Manuel II in Constantinople and then marched southward and annexed Thessaly. The Duchy of Athens accepted Ottoman overlordship when Turkish forces appeared on its border. Although a massive Ottoman punitive raid into the Peloponnese in 1395 netted much booty, events in the Balkans’ northeast saved Morea from further direct attack at the time.

While Bayezid was occupied in Greece, Mircea of Wallachia conducted a series of raids across the Danube into Ottoman territory. In retaliation, Bayezid&#x27;s forces, which included Serb vassal troops led by Lazarevic and Kralj Marko, struck into Wallachia in 1395 but were defeated at Rovine, where Marko was killed. The victory saved Wallachia from Turkish occupation, but Mircea accepted vassalage under Bayezid to avert further Ottoman intervention. The sultan took consolation for his less than victorious efforts in annexing Dobrudzha and in supporting a pretender, Vlad I (1395–97), to the Wallachian throne. Two years of civil war ensued before Mircea regained complete control of the principality.

====Nicopolis====

In 1396 Hungarian King Sigismund finally pulled together a crusade against the Ottomans. The crusader army was composed primarily of Hungarian and French knights, but included some Wallachian troops. Though nominally led by Sigismund, it lacked command cohesion. The crusaders crossed the Danube, marched through Vidin, and arrived at Nikopol, where they met the Turks. The headstrong French knights refused to follow Sigismund&#x27;s battle plans, resulting in their crushing defeat. Because Sratsimir had permitted the crusaders to pass through Vidin, Bayezid invaded his lands, took him prisoner, and annexed his territories. With Vidin&#x27;s fall, Bulgaria ceased to exist, becoming the first major Balkan Christian state to disappear completely by direct Ottoman conquest.

Following Nikopol, Bayezid contented himself with raiding Hungary, Wallachia, and Bosnia. He conquered most of Albania and forced the remaining northern Albanian lords into vassalage. A new, halfhearted siege of Constantinople was undertaken but lifted in 1397 after Emperor Manuel II, Bayezid&#x27;s vassal, agreed that the sultan should confirm all future Byzantine emperors. Soon thereafter Bayezid was called back to Anatolia to deal with continuing problems with the Ottomans’ Turkish rivals and never returned to the Balkans.

====Ankara, 1402====

Bayezid took with him an army composed primarily of Balkan vassal troops, including Serbs led by Lazarevic. He soon faced an invasion of Anatolia by the Central Asian ruler Timur Lenk. Around 1400, Timur entered the Middle East. Timur Lenk pillaged a few villages in eastern Anatolia and commenced the conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In August, 1400, Timur and his horde burned the town of Sivas to the ground and advanced into the mainland. Their armies met outside of Ankara, at the Battle of Ankara, in 1402. The Ottomans were routed and Bayezid was taken prisoner, later dying in captivity. A civil war, lasting from 1402 to 1413, broke out among Bayezid&#x27;s surviving sons. Known in Ottoman history as the Interregnum, that struggle temporarily halted active Ottoman expansion in the Balkans.

===Ottoman Interregnum (1402–1413)===

After the defeat at Ankara followed a time of total chaos in the Empire. Mongols roamed free in Anatolia and the political power of the sultan was broken. After Beyazid was captured, his remaining sons, Suleiman Çelebi, İsa Çelebi, Mehmed Çelebi, and Musa Çelebi fought each other in what became known as the Ottoman Interregnum.

The Ottoman Interregnum brought a brief period of semi-independence to the vassal Christian Balkan states. Suleyman, one of the late sultan&#x27;s sons, held the Ottoman capital at Edirne and proclaimed himself ruler, but his brothers refused to recognize him. He then concluded alliances with Byzantium, to which Thessaloniki was returned, and with Venice in 1403 to bolster his position. Suleyman&#x27;s imperious character, however, turned his Balkan vassals against him. In 1410 he was defeated and killed by his brother Musa, who won the Ottoman Balkans with the support of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II, Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarevic, Wallachian Voievod Mircea, and the two last Bulgarian rulers’ sons. Musa then was confronted for sole control of the Ottoman throne by his younger brother Mehmed, who had freed himself of Mongol vassalage and held Ottoman Anatolia.

Concerned over the growing independence of his Balkan Christian vassals, Musa turned on them. Unfortunately, he alienated the Islamic bureaucratic and commercial classes in his Balkan lands by continually favoring the lower social elements to gain wide popular support. Alarmed, the Balkan Christian vassal rulers turned to Mehmed, as did the chief Ottoman military, religious, and commercial leaders. In 1412 Mehmed invaded the Balkans, took Sofia and Nis, and joined forces with Lazarevicys Serbs. In the following year, Mehmed decisively defeated Musa outside of Sofia. Musa was killed, and Mehmed I (1413–21) emerged as the sole ruler of a reunited Ottoman state.

===Mehmed I (1413–1421)===

When Mehmed Çelebi stood as victor in 1413 he crowned himself in Edirne (Adrianople) as Mehmed I. His was the duty to restore the Ottoman Empire to its former glory. The Empire had suffered hard from the interregnum; the Mongols were still at large in the east, even though Timur had died in 1405; many of the Christian kingdoms of the Balkans had broken free of Ottoman control; and the land, especially Anatolia, had suffered hard from the war.

Mehmed moved the capital from Bursa to Adrianople. He faced a delicate political situation in the Balkans. His Bulgarian, Serbian, Wallachian, and Byzantine vassals were virtually independent. The Albanian tribes were uniting into a single state, and Bosnia remained completely independent, as did Moldavia. Hungary retained territorial ambitions in the Balkans, and Venice held numerous Balkan coastal possessions. Prior to Bayezid&#x27;s death, Ottoman control of the Balkans appeared a certainty. At the end of the interregnum, that certainty seemed open to question.

Mehmed generally resorted to diplomacy rather than militancy in dealing with the situation. While he did conduct raiding expeditions into neighboring European lands, which returned much of Albania to Ottoman control and forced Bosnian King-Ban Tvrtko II Kotromanić (1404–09, 1421–45), along with many Bosnian regional nobles, to accept formal Ottoman vassalage, Mehmed conducted only one actual war with the Europeans — a short and indecisive conflict with Venice.

The new sultan had grave domestic problems. Musa&#x27;s former policies sparked discontent among the Ottoman Balkans’ lower classes. In 1416 a popular revolt of Muslims and Christians broke out in Dobruja, led by Musa&#x27;s former confidant, the scholar-mystic Şeyh Bedreddin, and supported by Wallachian voivode Mircea I. Bedreddin preached such concepts as merging Islam, Christianity, and Judaism into a single faith and the social betterment of free peasants and nomads at the expense of the Ottoman bureaucratic and professional classes. Mehmed crushed the revolt and Bedreddin died. Mircea then occupied Dobruja, but Mehmed wrested the region back in 1419, capturing the Danubian fort of Giurgiu and forcing Wallachia back into vassalage.

Mehmed spent the rest of his reign reorganizing Ottoman state structures disrupted by the interregnum. When Mehmed died in 1421, one of his sons, Murad, became sultan.

===Murad II (1421–1451)===

Murad II spent his early years on the throne disposing of rivals and rebellions, most notably the revolts of the Serbs. He also had problems at home. He subdued the rebels of his uncle Mustafa Çelebi and brother Küçük Mustafa.

====Constantinople, 1422====

In 1422, Murad II laid siege to Constantinople for several months and lifted it only after forcing the Byzantine emperor, Manuel II Palaiologos to pay additional tribute.

In 1422 the first regular war against Venice began with the Siege of Thessalonica (1422–30). Byzantine involvement in the war ended with the transfer of the city to the Venetian Republic in 1423, which ended Murad&#x27;s siege of Constantinople. Thessalonica continued to be under siege until 1430, with the Turkish sack of the city.

====Thessalonika, 1430====
On the request of its inhabitants, Venetian troops took control of the city of Salonika (Thessaloniki). The Ottoman army that laid siege to the city knew nothing of the transfer of power, and a number of Venetian soldiers were killed by Ottoman troops, believing them to be Greeks. Murad II had been on peaceful terms with Venice, so the Venetians deemed the act unacceptable and declared full war.

Murad acted swiftly, besieging Constantinople and sending his armies to Salonika. The Venetians had gained reinforcements by sea but, when the Ottomans stormed the city, the outcome was forgone and the Venetians fled to their ships. But when the Turks entered and began plundering the city, the Venetian fleet started bombarding the city from the sea-side. The Ottomans fled and the fleet was able to hold off the Ottomans until new Venetian reinforcements arrived to recapture the city. The outcome of the Battle of Salonika was a setback for Murad. Serbia and Hungary allied themselves with Venice. Pope Martin V encouraged other Christian states to join the war against the Ottomans, though only Austria ever sent troops to the Balkans.

The war in the Balkans began as the Ottoman army moved to recapture Wallachia, which the Ottomans had lost to Mircea I of Wallachia during the Interregnum and that now was a Hungarian vassal state. As the Ottoman army entered Wallachia, the Serbs started attacking Bulgaria and, at the same time, urged by the Pope, the Anatolian emirate of Karamanid attacked the Empire from the back. Murad had to split his army. The main force went to defend Sofia and the reserves had to be called to Anatolia. The remaining troops in Wallachia were crushed by the Hungarian army that was now moving south into Bulgaria where the Serbian and Ottoman armies battled each other. The Serbs were defeated and the Ottomans turned to face the Hungarians who fled back into Wallachia when they realized they were unable to attack the Ottomans from the back. Murad fortified his borders against Serbia and Hungary but did not try to retake Wallachia. Instead, he sent his armies to Anatolia where they defeated Karaman in 1428.

In 1430 a large Ottoman fleet attacked Salonika by surprise. The Venetians signed a peace treaty in 1432. The treaty gave the Ottomans the city of Salonika and the surrounding land. The war by Serbia and Hungary against the Ottoman Empire had come to a standstill in 1441, when the Holy Roman Empire, Poland, Albania, and the Jandarid and Karamanid emirates (in violation of the peace treaty) intervened against the Ottomans. Niš and Sofia fell to the Christians in 1443. In 1444, the Empire suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Jalowaz. On July 12, 1444, Murad signed a treaty which gave Wallachia and the Bulgarian province of Varna to Hungary and gave western Bulgaria (including Sofia) to Serbia. It forced Murad to abdicate in favor of his twelve-year-old son Mehmed. Later the same year the Christians violated the peace treaty and attacked anew.

====Varna, 1444====

On November 10, 1444, Murad defeated the Polish–Hungarian army of Wladislaus III of Poland led by Janos Hunyadi at the Battle of Varna.

Murad was reinstated with the help of the Janissaries in 1446. Another peace treaty was signed in 1448 giving the Empire Wallachia and Bulgaria and a part of Albania. After the Balkan front was secured, Murad turned east and defeated Timur Lenk&#x27;s son, Shah Rukh, and the emirates of Candar and Karaman in Anatolia.

====Kosovo, 1448====

At 1448, John Hunyadi saw the right moment to lead a campaign against the Ottoman Empire. After the Defeat of Varna (1444), he raised another army to attack the Ottomans. His strategy based on possible revolt of Balkan people and the surprise attack, also the assumption to destroy the main force of the Ottomans in a single battle. Hunyadi was totally immodest and led his forces without leaving any escort behind.

Murad died in the winter 1450–1451 in Edirne. Some have it that he was wounded in a battle against Skanderbeg&#x27;s Albanian guerillas.

===Mehmed II (1451–1481)===

Mehmed II (called &quot;Fatih&quot;, the Conqueror) again came to the Ottoman throne following Murad&#x27;s death in 1451. But by conquering and annexing the emirate of Karamanid (May–June, 1451) and by renewing the peace treaties with Venice (September 10) and Hungary (November 20) Mehmed II proved his skills both on the military and the political front and was soon accepted by the noble class of the Ottoman court.

Older and a good deal wiser, he made capturing Constantinople his first priority, believing that it would solidify his power over the high military and administrative officials who had caused him such problems during his earlier reign. Good reasons underlay his decision. So long as Constantinople remained in Christian hands, his enemies could use it as either a potential base for splitting the empire at its center or as an excuse for the Christian West&#x27;s continued military efforts. Constantinople&#x27;s location also made it the natural &quot;middleman&quot; center for both land and sea trade between the eastern Mediterranean and central Asia, possession of which would ensure immense wealth. Just as important, Constantinople was a fabled imperial city, and its capture and possession would bestow untold prestige on its conqueror, who would be seen by Muslims as a hero and by Muslims and Christians alike as a great and powerful emperor.

Mehmed spent two years preparing for his attempt on the Byzantine capital. He built a navy to cut the city off from outside help by sea; he purchased an arsenal of large cannons from the Hungarian gunsmith Urban; he sealed the Bosphorus north of the city by erecting a powerful fortress on its European shore to prevent succor arriving from the Black Sea; and he meticulously concentrated in Thrace every available military unit in his lands. A trade agreement with Venice prevented the Venetians from intervening on behalf of the Byzantines, and the rest of Western Europe unwittingly cooperated with Mehmed&#x27;s plans by being totally absorbed in internecine wars and political rivalries.

====Constantinople, 1453====
When in 1451 the bankrupt Byzantines asked Mehmed to double the tribute for holding an Ottoman pretender for the throne, he used the request as a pretext for annulling all treaties with the Byzantine Empire. Nevertheless, when he proposed in 1452 to siege Constantinople most of the divan, and especially the Grand Vizier, Çandarlı Halil Pasha, was against it and criticized the Sultan for being too rash and overconfident in his abilities. On April 15, 1452, Mehmed ordered preparations to be made for the siege of Constantinople.

In April 1453, Mehmed laid siege to Constantinople. Although the city&#x27;s defenders, led by Giovanni Giustiniani under Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos&#x27;s (1448–53) authority, put up a heroic defense, without the benefit of outside aid their efforts were doomed. The formerly impregnable land walls were breached after two months of constant pounding by Mehmed&#x27;s heavy artillery. In the predawn hours of 29 May 1453, Mehmed ordered an all-out assault on the battered ramparts. After a brief but vicious melee at the walls in which Giustiniani was severely injured coupled with Ottoman troops breaching the walls through a sally port door left open, the Ottoman troops were able to breach the walls and rout the defenders. According to Christian sources, Emperor Constantine died bravely rushing into the oncoming Ottoman troops not to be seen again. However, according to Ottoman sources such as Tursun Beg he threw off his mantle and attempted to flee before being cut down by an injured Ottoman soldier. The Ottoman Army broke through and swept over the city. Constantinople, for a millennium considered by many Europeans the divinely ordained capital of the Christian Roman Empire, fell to Mehmed and was transformed into what many Muslims considered the divinely ordained capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. The fabled city&#x27;s imperial legacy lived on. After the conquest, the sultan had his grand vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha killed. His following four granviziers were of devshirme origin. During the growth of the Empire Turks seldom were appointed to the high positions.

&lt;br&gt;
Following the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed built the Topkapı Palace in 1462 and moved the Ottoman capital there from Adrianople. Mehmed had himself titled &quot;Kaiser-i-Rum&quot;, or &quot;Roman Caesar&quot;, and modelled the state after the old Byzantine Empire, thinking of himself as the successor to the Roman throne. Later, when he invaded Otranto, his goal was to capture Rome and reunite the Roman Empire for the first time since 751. Justinian&#x27;s cathedral of Hagia Sophia was converted into an imperial mosque, as eventually were numerous other churches and monasteries. The rights of non-Muslim inhabitants were protected to ensure continuity and stability for commercial activities. Never fully recovered from the sack of 1204, and suffering from Byzantium&#x27;s two centuries of near poverty, Constantinople by the time of Mehmed&#x27;s conquest was but a hollow shell of its former self. Its population had dwindled, and much property was either abandoned or in a state of disrepair. The sultan immediately began to repopulate the city. Civic and private properties were offered to the public to entice much-needed skilled artisans, craftsmen, and traders of all religions and ethnicities back to the city.

<text>Robert Adame Beltran (born November 19, 1953) is an American actor known for his role as Commander Chakotay on the 1990s television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. He is also known for stage acting in California, and for playing Raoul Mendoza in the 1982 black comedy film &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;.

==Early life==
Beltran was born in Bakersfield, California, the son of Aurelia and Luis Beltran Perez, immigrants from Mexico. He attended East Bakersfield High School and Bakersfield College. He has two sisters and seven brothers, including Latin Jazz musician Louie Cruz Beltran.
==Career==
Beltran graduated from California State University, Fresno with a degree in Theater Arts and moved to Los Angeles to begin his acting career. He had his first film role in &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; in 1981, but his breakthrough came in 1982 when he played the title character in the independently produced dark comedy &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;. Beltran had a supporting role as Chuck Norris&#x27; partner Trooper Kayo Ramos in the 1983 film &quot;Lone Wolf McQuade&quot;. He then starred in the 1984 TV film &quot;The Mystic Warrior&quot; as Native American brave Ahbleza, and as Hector in 1984&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Comet&quot;.
He played Father Michael in a 1993 episode of “Murder She Wrote” (S9, E12).
He played Commander Chakotay, the Native American first officer of the starship &quot;Voyager&quot;, in the science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; from 1995 to 2001. During this time, he won the Nosotros Golden Eagle Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Series in 1997. He was also nominated in 1996 for the NCLR Bravo Award for Outstanding Television Series Actor in a Crossover Role, and the ALMA Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Television Series in a Crossover Role in 1998 and 1999.

Beltran founded and co-directed the East LA Classic Theater Group. He is also a member of the Classical Theater Lab, an ensemble of professional actors who co-produced his production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1997, which he directed and starred in.

Beltran has collaborated with amateur actors in performing plays and scenes of plays of William Shakespeare. He produced and starred in a Los Angeles production of &quot;The Big Knife&quot; by Clifford Odets, a play which explores the Hollywood environment under the big studio system of the 1940s.

In May 2009, Beltran played the dual roles of Don Fermin and Older Eusebio in the American Conservatory Theater&#x27;s staging of José Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Boleros for the Disenchanted&quot;. He had the recurring role of Jerry Flute in Seasons 3 and 4 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Big Love&quot;.

<doc id="535291" wikidata="Q673947" url="?curid=535291" title="In da Club">
<text>&quot;In da Club&quot; is a song by American rapper 50 Cent from his debut studio album &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; (2003). Written by 50 Cent alongside producers Dr. Dre and Mike Elizondo, the song, which uses an unconventional off-beat rhythm, was released on January 7, 2003, as the album&#x27;s lead single and peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming 50 Cent&#x27;s first number-one single.

&quot;In da Club&quot; received praise from critics; at the 46th Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Male Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song. The accompanying music video for &quot;In da Club&quot; won Best Rap Video and Best New Artist at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2009, the song was listed at number 24 in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. It was listed at number 13 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;Best Songs of the Decade&quot;. In 2010, it was ranked 448th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. It was performed by 50 Cent in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show on February 13, 2022.

==Background==
After 50 Cent was discovered by fellow rapper Eminem in 2002, he flew to Los Angeles where he was introduced to record producer Dr. Dre. &quot;In da Club&quot; was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. 50 Cent described the studio sessions, saying: 

The production was originally given to the hip-hop group D12, but was passed on to 50 Cent because the group did not know how to approach the song. He recorded the track with only the drum beat present. Since much of the content on &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&quot;″ was &quot;dark&quot;, he wanted to write material that was &quot;the exact opposite&quot;. He called the song a &quot;celebration of life. Every day it&#x27;s relevant all over &#x27;cause every day is someone&#x27;s birthday.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;In da Club&quot; received universal acclaim by music critics. AllMusic described it as &quot;a tailor-made mass-market good-time single&quot;. &quot;The Source&quot; called the song a &quot;guaranteed party starter&quot; with its &quot;blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps&quot;. The BBC also wrote that the song is &quot;a spectacular party anthem&quot; that &quot;highlights 50 Cent&#x27;s ability to twist his words effortlessly&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that 50 Cent &quot;boasts unashamedly of his career objectives and newly flush bank account&quot; with lyrics such as &quot;I&#x27;m feelin&#x27; focus, man, my money on my mind/Got a mil out the deal and I&#x27;m still on the grind.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the song sports &quot;a spare yet irresistible synth hook augmented by a tongue-twisting refrain&quot;.&quot;The Guardian&quot; called the track &quot;irresistible&quot; due to its &quot;sparse orchestral samples and snaking chorus&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; said, &quot;the bounce on &#x27;In da Club&#x27; is straight-up irresistible, Dre at both minimalist best and most deceptively infectious.&quot; &quot;Splendid&quot; magazine called the song an &quot;insanely catchy&quot; single with its &quot;stanky, horn-addled thump&quot;. The track was listed at number ten on &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;. In 2008, it was ranked at number 18 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs&quot;.

==Chart performance==
&quot;In da Club&quot; debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on issue date of January 11, 2003, and debuted at number 67. A couple of weeks later the song ascended to the top 10; after eight weeks, the song topped the charts, becoming his first number one, and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, blocking R. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; for five weeks. The song was later replaced by Sean Paul&#x27;s &quot;Get Busy&quot; and remained in the top 10 for 17 weeks, and on the chart for 30 weeks. The track also reached number one on the Top 40 Tracks, Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, and Hot Rap Tracks charts. In March 2003, it broke a &quot;Billboard&quot; record as the &quot;most listened-to&quot; song in radio history within a week. &quot;Billboard&quot; also ranked it as the number one song for 2003. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the track Gold. In 2023, it was certified Diamond by the RIAA.

Nominated for Best Male Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song at the 2004 Grammy Awards, it lost to Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;.

Across Europe, it reached number one in Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and number three in the UK. In Australia, the single peaked at number one, was certified two times Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, and on the 2003 year-end chart, it was listed at number five.

==Music video==
Philip Atwell directed the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage was used in the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. Set in a fictional hip-hop boot camp known as the &quot;Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center&quot;, the video begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location, marked &quot;Somewhere...&quot;, (actually the Volcano House in Newberry Springs). Video clips from Eminem&#x27;s single &quot;Without Me&quot; are seen playing in the entrance on flat-screen TVs. Eminem and Dr. Dre are seen looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from a gym roof. Atwell commented, &quot;I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out&quot;. The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell deemed appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, &quot;creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for.&quot;

The video ends with the camera zooming out of the club to reveal a two-way mirror with Eminem and Dr. Dre in white lab uniforms, observing 50 Cent and taking notes. Atwell stated that &quot;seeing 50 with Dre and Em having his back is as big a visual statement as it is a musical statement&quot; and the shot was significant because it made clear the club was inside the center and not unrelated performance footage. On January 27, 2003, the video debuted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days. It also reached number one on the &quot;MuchMusic&quot; video charts. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was awarded Best Rap Video and Best New Artist and was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, and Viewer&#x27;s Choice. Cameos include: Dr. Dre, D12, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, The Game (in his first cameo appearance), Bang Em Smurf, Young Buck, Xzibit and DJ Whoo Kid.

The music video on YouTube has received over 2.263 billion views as of January 2025.

==Lawsuit==
In January 2006, 50 Cent was sued for copyright infringement by former 2 Live Crew manager Joseph Weinberger, who owns the rights to the rap group&#x27;s catalog. He claimed that 50 Cent plagiarized the lines &quot;it&#x27;s your birthday&quot; from the eponymous second track of former 2 Live Crew frontman Luther Campbell&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Freak for Life 6996&quot; (also known simply as &quot;Freak for Life&quot;). The lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Paul Huck, who ruled that the phrase was a &quot;common, unoriginal and noncopyrightable element of the song&quot;. 50 Cent&#x27;s attorneys in the litigation included noted entertainment litigator Jeffrey D. Goldman.

==&quot;Sexy Lil Thug&quot;==
In 2003, American recording artist Beyoncé recorded a remix version of &quot;In da Club&quot; titled &quot;Sexy Lil Thug&quot;. Her version sampled the original&#x27;s instrumental and melody with the singer singing her own, newly added verses. In the song, she references Jimmy Choo shoes, Marilyn Monroe, Marc Jacobs, and Bailey Bank and Biddle. Makkada B. Selah of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said, &quot;Her version of &#x27;In da Club&#x27; outed 50 Cent as a singing-ass rapper with lines like &#x27;Don&#x27;t wanna be your girl/I ain&#x27;t lookin&#x27; for no love/So come give me a hug/You a sexy little thug. Joey Guerra of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; coined Beyoncé&#x27;s cover version as a &quot;female spin&quot; on the original. The song was officially released on Beyoncé&#x27;s mixtape &quot;Speak My Mind&quot;. According to Guerra of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, the song was never an official single, likely because of permission issues. Beyoncé&#x27;s version of the song charted for 7 weeks and peaked at number 67 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In 2013, Mike Wass of the website Idolator put &quot;Sexy Lil Thug&quot; at number six on his list of &quot;Beyonce&#x27;s 10 Best Unreleased and Rare Tracks&quot;. He described it as a &quot;radio staple&quot; in 2003, adding that it &quot;remains something of a lost gem&quot; and concluded &quot;Queen Bey spit iconic lyrics like &#x27;I&#x27;m that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body.

===Sampling===
&quot;In da Club&quot; has been sampled or interpolated in at least 90 songs, including &quot;Mi Gna&quot; by Super Sako, &quot;Good Life&quot; by Kanye West, &quot;Genesis&quot; by Justice and &quot;Iffy&quot; by Chris Brown.

<text>&quot;P.I.M.P.&quot; is a song recorded by American rapper 50 Cent for his debut studio album &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; (2003). It features production from Mr. Porter of D12 and was mixed by Dr. Dre. The song was released as the third single from &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin″&quot; alongside its remix, featuring American rappers Snoop Dogg, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck, on June 24, 2003, by Interscope Records, Shady Records and Aftermath Entertainment.

Upon its release, &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot; was a significant commercial success, especially in the United States, where it peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while reaching the top ten of numerous national charts worldwide. The song was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Although the remix was not originally part of the track listing for &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&quot;&#x27;, it was later added as a bonus track on some digital editions of the album.

==Content==
Musically, the song is based on a highly steelpan prominent production from Mr. Porter from D12, and although it is predominantly a rap song, features elements of other genres, especially reggae, or music similar to that of the Caribbean. Lyrically, the song glorifies 50 Cent&#x27;s supposed involvement in the &#x27;pimp&#x27; lifestyle.

==Music video==
The music video features the four rappers rapping with topless women. The video comes in two slightly different versions: one with the topless women and a &quot;clean&quot; version without. On July 15, 2003, the video debuted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, it was nominated for Best Rap Video, but lost to Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;99 Problems&quot;.

The video had 50 Cent trying to audition to become a member of the P.I.M.P. Legion of Doom that is led by Snoop Dogg&#x27;s character. When asked why they should let him join the P.I.M.P. Legion of Doom as he doesn&#x27;t have a Cadillac and/or a perm, 50 Cent ends up winning their favor by showing off his Magic Stick.

The music video on YouTube has received over 665 million views as of June 2024.

==Samples and covers==
In 2008, the Bacao Rhythm &amp; Steel Band released a single &quot;PIMP&quot; from their album &quot;55&quot; (2016). It was such a faithful cover that many people incorrectly believed that it was the source of the steel drum melody used in the 50 Cent single, though the Bacao single was released five years after 50 Cent had released &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot;. This cover features heavily in the French legal thriller &quot;Anatomy of a Fall&quot;.

Additional covers of the song include those on &quot;Hip Hop Baby&quot; (a 2004 compilation album of kid-friendly tunes from the group Tunes for Baby That Won&#x27;t Drive You Crazy), and &quot;P.I.N.T.&quot;, a parody version by British rapper 50 Pence (from his 2004 album &quot;50 Pence Presents&quot;).

==Legal controversy==
In June 2016, producer Brandon Parrott and business manager Erica Tucker sued almost everyone involved with the 50 Cent record &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&quot;&#x27;, claiming that he was tricked into licensing the use of a beat from his track &quot;BAMBA&quot;. Aftermath Records and Universal requested that the case be dismissed on the grounds that Parrott had already been compensated in an earlier settlement. Judge S. James Otero dismissed the complaint without leave to amend in November 2016.

<doc id="535298" wikidata="Q4529809" url="?curid=535298" title="Edward Ka-Spel">
<text>Edward Sharp, better known by his stage name Edward Ka-Spel, (aka &#x27;Archangel, Che Banana, The Prophet Qa&#x27;Spell, Qa-Sepel) is an English singer-songwriter and musician, born in London on 23 January 1954, to a family with East Anglia connections. He is best known for his work with the band The Legendary Pink Dots, which he co-founded.

Ka-Spel is also known for his work on The Tear Garden with Skinny Puppy&#x27;s cEvin Key. In 2017, he collaborated with Amanda Palmer on the album &quot;I Can Spin a Rainbow&quot;.

Ka-spel&#x27;s recordings are often of a limited number and only available through an extensive and devoted mail-order system at Soleilmoon. He has also released numerous cassette-only special recordings, usually including materials out-of-print on earlier labels along with new releases. He often appears on stage barefoot, wearing a long scarf and either pink or black glasses. Early in his career, he drew black lines on his face and arms.

==Biography==
Ka-Spel is best known as the lead singer, keyboard and electronics player, songwriter and co-founder of the band The Legendary Pink Dots, in which he was initially known as D&#x27;Archangel, Prophet Q&#x27;Sepel and other pseudonyms. He has also released numerous solo albums (initially featuring other members of the Legendary Pink Dots, and including contributions from Steven Stapleton), and has worked in various side projects, including The Tear Garden (with cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy), and Mimir (with Phil Knight, Christoph Heemann, Jim O&#x27;Rourke and others). An album with 48 Cameras, &quot;Songs from the Marriage of Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; was released in 2019.

Ka-Spel&#x27;s solo albums range from abstract electronic noise to more traditional pop songs, incorporating diverse elements of psychedelia, industrial, avant garde, experimental electronic, art pop, classical music, folk (nursery songs), sampling, noise, collage, music concrete, etc. His lyrics have been described as mystically bizarre and ambiguous, and incorporate recurrent themes from his own personal mythos. Ka-Spel&#x27;s songwriting has been compared to that of Syd Barrett and early Pink Floyd, though the artist describes the comparison as being a coincidence, not a direct influence. Ka-Spel has cited Iannis Xenakis, the Beatles, Nurse With Wound, David Bowie, Brainticket, Can, The Residents, Magma, and Throbbing Gristle as significant influences.

<text>Redlight is an album by the Slackers, released in 1997.

The band promoted the album by touring as part of the NYC Ska Mob Tour &#x27;97. The opening track is a tribute to Tommy McCook.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that the Slackers &quot;are clearly as interested in ska&#x27;s jazz roots as its R&amp;B ones.&quot; &quot;The Gazette&quot; concluded that &quot;the ska tempo is slackened, proclaiming Jamaican independence while lowering tariff walls for reggae, dub, R&amp;B, soul, jazz and boogaloo.&quot; The &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; wrote that the album takes the listener on a musical tour &quot;of the studios of Jamaica, the tiny clubs of London, the streets of New York, and the barrios of Los Angeles.&quot;

The &quot;Deseret News&quot; listed the album as one of the best of 1997, writing: &quot;Outside of the Skatalites, the only band that can do traditional ska.&quot; The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; also considered it to be one of 1997&#x27;s best albums, writing that &quot;Married Girl&quot;, a &quot;&quot;Double Indemnity&quot;-style tale of lustful revenge, is a killer.&quot;

<text>, or  in Palauan, is an island and state in the island nation of Palau.

==History==


Angaur was traditionally divided among some eight clans. Traditional features within clan areas represent important symbols giving identity to families, clans and regions . These features include a variety of stone platforms with historical and traditional importance. Traditional cemeteries are frequently located in or around some of these stone platforms. The large quantities of shell recovered from archaeological sites gives evidence for an intensive exploitation of the limited lagoon surrounding the island and for collecting and fishing outside of the reef as well. On the island, the localized areas of soil were intensively used for garden plots.

The first sighting of Angaur, Babeldaob, Koror, and Peleliu recorded by Westerners was by the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos at the end of January 1543. They were then charted as &quot;Los Arrecifes&quot; (The Reefs in Spanish). In November and December 1710, these three islands were again visited and explored by the Spanish missionary expedition commanded by Sargento Mayor Francisco Padilla on board of the patache &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. Two years later they were explored in detail by the expedition of Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy.

From 1909 until 1954 phosphate mining took place on Angaur, originally by the Germans, then the Japanese, and finally by Americans. Angaur is the site of a major World War II battle. The Battle of Angaur was part of the larger offensive campaign called Operation Forager that ran from June to Nov 1944. Many American and Japanese battle relics remain scattered throughout the island. The 7th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion under Lieutenant colonel Henry R. Paige served as garrison forces for the remainder of the War. Angaur is the only place in Micronesia that has feral monkeys; they are descended from macaques that escaped during the period of German occupation. Thus it is also called Monkey Island.

Angaur is accessible by boats and small planes, and Belau Air has service to Angaur Airstrip. From 1945 to 1978 the U.S. Coast Guard operated a LORAN transmitting station, LORSTA Palau, as part of the worldwide LORAN navigation system.

== Geography ==
Angaur is a coralline island located some 10 km southwest of Beliliou at the southern tip of the main group of islands in the archipelago, and is situated outside of the lagoon and enclosing reef for this main group. Angaur is surrounded by a thin reef which encloses a narrow lagoon, though for the most part the reef is so small and low that it offers little impediment to the waves which break directly on the steep cliffs which ring the island. Distinct from the rock islands which lie between Beliliou and Koror, Angaur is a raised platform island. The profile of the island is a low table with very little relief. The highest point on the island, a small hill northwest of Rois, is only 40 m above sea level, and most of the island is less than 10 m above sea level. On the ground, however, the terrain is very rugged with steep, jagged outcrops of ancient reef rising unpredictably in a tangled maze. To the northwest the ground is slightly higher, and to the southeast the ground is slightly lower with marshy swamps across the karstic landscape.

Modern settlement on Angaur is concentrated on the west coast south of the harbor to a point of land called Bkul a Usas. Separated by lines of social division are the modern villages of Rois and Ngaramasch.

Most of Angaur is covered with a mixed limestone forest which includes several small stands of casuarina forest (ironwood orngas trees). Surrounding the modern villages and many houses are garden plots and interspersed with these are small pockets of agroforest (a variety of trees providing useful domestic products and foodstuffs). A large area of taro swamp gardens known as Ngetkebui lies in the southern part of the island.

The island, which forms its own state, has an area of 8 km2 (3 mi2). Its population was 130 in 2012. The state capital is the village of Ngeremasch on the western side. A second village, Rois, is immediately east of Ngeremasch. Angaur Island is located southwest of Peleliu, and it is a popular surfing location.

=== Phosphate ===
Long before people came to this part of the Pacific Ocean, Angaur was a nesting ground for large numbers of birds whose droppings would eventually become phosphate deposits. In the early part of the 20th century, phosphate mines were started in the rugged terrain in the northwest part of the island and along the east coast. These mines, started during the German administration, were in operation periodically for three administrations ending in the 1950s in the American Period. The mined phosphate was initially processed and loaded on ships at a small harbor on the west side of the island. Apparently this small natural harbor has been expanded during the course of phosphate mining. Also constructed with the harbor expansion was a lighthouse whose abandoned remains are situated on the high ground to the northwest.

== Demography ==
The population of the state was 119 in the 2015 census and median age was 43.3 years.

In June 1972, the resident population was 517. History of the population:
Ucherbelau is the title of the traditional high chief from the state.

==Languages==
According to the state constitution of 1982, Angaur&#x27;s official languages are Palauan (and the Angauran dialect in particular), English and Japanese. It is the only place in the world where Japanese is a &quot;de jure&quot; official language, as it is only the &quot;de facto&quot; official language of Japan. At the time the constitution was written, many of the elders participating in the process had been educated in Japanese, as was the practice once Japan gained control of the South Seas Mandate in 1914.

However, the results of the 2005 census show that in April 2005 there were no usual or legal residents of Angaur aged 5 or older who spoke Japanese at home at all. No residents of Anguar reported themselves or were reported as being of Japanese ethnic origin. One person born (but apparently not residing) on Angaur reported to speak Japanese and Palauan equally often at home. The 2012 mini census showed 7 people aged 10 or older literate in any language other than Palauan and English for Angaur, out of a total population of 130.

==Political system==
Angaur has its own constitution, adopted in 1982. The state government was established in 1982. The state of Angaur, with population of less than 150, has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every two years. The state population elects one of the members of the House of Delegates of Palau.

== Transport ==
The island is connected by a network of roads. Secondary roads radiate out across the island and almost encircle it. On the east side of the island is a landing strip constructed during the Japanese administration. Although unimproved, the 6600 foot runway known as the Angaur Airstrip is used for the single-engine plane serving Angaur with daily flights from the Airai airport. The presence of the runway played an important role in the decision by the Americans to take Angaur along with Beliliou during World War II. Unlike the battle of Peleliu, however, Angaur received much less shelling before the invasion and the battle did not entail the tragic loss of life witnessed on Beliliou.

== Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Angaur Elementary School was established in 1945. A new building in another location opened in 1953. It moved to the original site in 1966 in a new building but it later moved back to the second site.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

== Tourism ==
It is a very popular place for surfing. In 2003, the Palau National Congress legalized casino gambling on the island.

Among other attractions are the cemetery of planes and ships that were destroyed in World War II, a Buddhist memorial honoring the Japanese fallen in combat and a small Japanese Shinto shrine.

<text>David Lennox Mills (June 3, 1938 – January 17, 2024) was an American computer engineer and professor emeritus at the University of Delaware. He was an Internet pioneer who led the Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures (GADS) Task Force. He was known as the internet&#x27;s &quot;Father Time&quot; for designing the Network Time Protocol, which is intended to synchronize all participating computers across different computer systems and networks to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time.

== Early life and education ==
David Lennox Mills was born in Oakland, California, on June 3, 1938. His mother, Adele (née Dougherty), was a pianist, and his father, Alfred, was an engineer. He had glaucoma since birth, but a surgeon saved some of the vision in his left eye when he was a child. He attended a school in San Mateo, California, for the visually impaired.

Mills earned his PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences from the University of Michigan in 1971. While at Michigan, he worked on the ARPA-sponsored Conversational Use of Computers (CONCOMP) project and developed DEC PDP-8-based hardware and software to allow terminals to be connected over phone lines to an IBM 360 mainframe.

== Career ==
In 1977, Mills began working at COMSAT on synchronizing the clocks of computers connected to ARPANET, inventing the Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). He told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2022 that he enjoyed working on synchronized time because no one else was working on it, giving him his own &quot;little fief&quot;. In the mid-2000s, Mills turned over full control of the NTP reference implementation to Harlan Stenn.

Mills was a contributor to the standards and software that came to be the Internet. He was the chairman of the Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures Task Force (GADS) and the first chairman of the Internet Architecture Task Force. He invented the DEC LSI-11-based Fuzzball router that was used for the 56 kbit/s NSFNET (1985), and inspired the author of ping. He authored 28 RFCs,
including two Internet Standards.

In 1999, he was inducted as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, and in 2002, he was inducted as a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for contributions to network protocols and network timekeeping in the development of the Internet. In 2008, Mills was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for contributions to Internet timekeeping and the development of the Network Time Protocol. In 2013 he received the IEEE Internet Award &quot;for significant leadership and sustained contributions in the research, development, standardization, and deployment of quality time synchronization capabilities for the Internet.&quot;

Mills was a professor emeritus at the University of Delaware, where he was a full professor from 1986 to 2008. He subsequently held an adjunct appointment at Delaware so that he could continue to teach.

== Personal life ==
Mills married Beverly Csizmadia in 1965.

Mills was an amateur radio operator, with callsign W3HCF.

His vision began worsening around 2012, and by 2022 he was fully blind. Mills died in Newark, Delaware, on January 17, 2024, at age 85. Mills&#x27; wife, Beverly Jean Csizmadia Mills, died September 30, 2024, in Newark, Delaware.

<text>The Legendary Pink Dots (aka LPD) are an Anglo-Dutch experimental rock band formed in London in August 1980. In 1984, the band moved to Amsterdam, playing with rotating musicians and having, as core members, singer/songwriter/keyboardist Edward Ka-Spel and keyboardist Phil Knight. In 2022, founding member and synthesist Philip Knight retired from touring, and Randall Frazier (Orbit Service, A Star Too Far) joined the band on synths, samples and electronics. While no official announcement has been made, Phil Knight is not included in post-2022 recording liner notes.

As of 2022, the group is composed of Edward Ka-Spel (vocals, keyboards, songwriter), Randall Frazier (keyboards, electronics), Erik Drost (guitars) and Joep Hendrikx (live electronics/devices).

Their music has incorporated elements from neo-psychedelia, ambient music, electronic music, tape music, psychedelic folk, synthpop, post-punk, progressive jazz, noise music, pop music, goth rock and alternative rock. Although outside the mainstream (in terms of their avant-garde music and non-mainstream career path), LPD have released more than forty albums, have a devoted worldwide following, and tour frequently.

==Overview==

The band was originally called One Day... but subsequently changed the name to The Legendary Pink Dots. In the 1980s, the band released albums on Mirrordot and InPhaze; in 1985 they signed with Play It Again Sam for the release of &quot;The Lovers&quot;. The line-up became stable by 1988, with Niels van Hoornblower (horns) and Bob Pistoor (guitar) joining for the band&#x27;s 1988 US tour. Pistoor died of cancer and his place was filled by Martijn de Kleer; drummer Ryan Moore completed the line-up live and in the studio. Their appeal has always been relatively small—a 1995 show in Mexico in front of 2,500 fans was described as &quot;massive (by Dots&#x27; standards)&quot;. In 2004, Erik Drost replaced Martijn de Kleer on guitar, and the album The Whispering Wall was released. 

Their music touches on elements of neo-psychedelia, ambient music, electronic music, tape music, psychedelic folk, synthpop, post-punk, progressive, jazz, noise, pop, and goth rock, with a distinctly experimental/avant-garde bent; their sound has evolved over time and remains distinctive, making it difficult to place the group into a concise style or genre. The group&#x27;s overall sound combined with Ka-Spel&#x27;s distinct lyrics and singing have earned comparisons to Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett; the group also has links to the sounds of krautrock bands such as Can, Faust, Brainticket and Neu! (whose &quot;Super&quot; they covered on the 1999 tribute album &quot;A Homage to NEU!&quot;), as well as the music of Magma.

==Related bands==
The Pink Dots frequently collaborated with Skinny Puppy&#x27;s cEvin Key, forming a side project named The Tear Garden. Key played drums on several tracks of the 1994 LPD album &quot;9 Lives to Wonder&quot;. 

Ryan Moore, who drummed on studio and live performances for the Legendary Pink Dots, left to work on his own musical outlet, the Twilight Circus Dub Sound System. He wrote and produced albums for Michael Rose of Black Uhuru, and has worked with other reggae figures such as Sly Dunbar.

The Pink Dots have influenced a wide range of bands, such as The Dresden Dolls, MGMT, Orbit Service, and Skinny Puppy.

<doc id="535329" wikidata="Q1417174" url="?curid=535329" title="Fictitious entry">
<text>Fictitious or fake entries are deliberately incorrect entries in reference works such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, and directories, added by the editors as copyright traps to reveal subsequent plagiarism or copyright infringement. There are more specific terms for particular kinds of fictitious entry, such as Mountweazel, trap street, paper town, phantom settlement, and .

==Terminology==

The neologism &quot;Mountweazel&quot; was coined by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Henry Alford in an article that mentioned a fictitious biographical entry intentionally placed as a copyright trap in the 1975 &quot;New Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;. The entry described Lillian Virginia Mountweazel as a fountain designer turned photographer, who died in an explosion while on assignment for &quot;Combustibles&quot; magazine. Allegedly, she was widely known for her photo-essays of unusual subject matter, including New York City buses, the cemeteries of Paris, and rural American mailboxes. According to the encyclopedia&#x27;s editor, it is a tradition for encyclopedias to put a fake entry to trap competitors for plagiarism. The surname came to be associated with all such fictitious entries.

The term , combining the Latin &quot;nihil&quot; (&quot;nothing&quot;) and German &quot;Artikel&quot; (&quot;article&quot;), is sometimes used.

== Copyright traps ==
By including a trivial piece of false information in a larger work, it is easier to demonstrate subsequent plagiarism if the fictitious entry is copied along with other material. An admission of this motive appears in the preface to Chambers&#x27; 1964 mathematical tables: &quot;those [errors] that are known to exist form an uncomfortable trap for any would-be plagiarist&quot;. Similarly, trap streets may be included in a map, or invented phone numbers in a telephone directory.

Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright (see &quot;Feist v. Rural&quot;, Fred Worth lawsuit or &quot;Nester&#x27;s Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.&quot;, 796 F.Supp. 729, E.D.N.Y., 1992).

=== Reference works ===
* In August 2005, &quot;The New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; gained media coverage when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This later was determined to be the word &quot;esquivalience&quot;, defined as &quot;the wilful avoidance of one&#x27;s official responsibilities&quot;, which had been added to the edition published in 2001. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus easy to copy.
* David Pogue, author of several books offering tips and tricks for computer users, deliberately placed a bogus tip in one of his books as a way of catching plagiarism. The fake tip, which purported to make a rabbit appear on the computer screen when certain keys were pressed, did indeed appear in subsequent works.
*In addition to the 1975 &quot;New Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; entry on Lillian Virginia Mountweazel, the editors created another fictitious entry concerning the purported blind American artist, Robert Dayton. The article claims Dayton experimented “with odor-emitting gases that resemble pungent body odors.&quot; His supposed &quot;Aroma-Art&quot; is presented in a sealed chamber where an audience inhales scented air.
* The German-language medical encyclopedia &quot;Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch&quot; features an entry on the &quot;Steinlaus&quot; (stone louse), a rock-eating animal. This was originally included as a copyright trap. The scientific name &quot;Petrophaga lorioti&quot; implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist Loriot. The &quot;Pschyrembel&quot; entry was removed in 1996 but, after reader protests, was restored the next year, with an extended section on the role of the stone louse in the fall of the Berlin Wall.
* Webster&#x27;s &quot;New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language&quot; once contained an entry for the fictitious bird jungftak: 

=== Maps ===
Fictitious entries on maps may be called phantom settlements, trap streets, paper towns, cartographer&#x27;s follies, or other names. They are intended to help reveal copyright infringements. They are not to be confused with paper streets, which are streets which are planned but as of the printing of the map have not yet been built.

* In 1978, the fictional American towns of Beatosu and Goblu in Ohio were inserted into that year&#x27;s official state of Michigan map as nods to the University of Michigan and its traditional rival, The Ohio State University.
* The fictional town of Agloe, New York in the United States was invented by map makers, but eventually became identified as a real place by its county administration because a building, the Agloe General Store, was erected at its fictional location. The &quot;town&quot; is featured in the novel &quot;Paper Towns&quot; by John Green and its film adaptation. Agloe is also featured prominently in the 2022 novel &quot;The Cartographers&quot; by Peng Shepherd.
* Mount Richard, a fictitious peak on the continental divide in the United States, appeared on county maps in the early 1970s. It was believed to be the work of a draftsman, Richard Ciacci. The nonexistence of the mountain was undiscovered for two years.
* In the United Kingdom in 2001, the Ordnance Survey (OS) obtained a £20m out-of-court settlement from the Automobile Association (the AA) after content from OS maps was reproduced on AA maps. The Ordnance Survey denied that it included &quot;deliberate mistakes&quot; in its maps as copyright traps, claiming the &quot;fingerprints&quot; which identified a copy were stylistic features such as the width of roads.
* The 2002 Geographers A-Z Map of Manchester contains traps. For example, Dickinson Street in central Manchester is falsely named &quot;Philpott St&quot;.
* The non-existent town of Argleton&#x27;s appearance in Google Maps was investigated by Steve Punt in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Punt P.I&quot;. The programme concluded that the town&#x27;s entry may well have originated as a copyright trap.

=== Trivia books ===

*Fred L. Worth, the author of &quot;The Trivia Encyclopedia&quot;, placed deliberately false information about the first name of TV detective Columbo for copy-trap purposes. He later sued the creators of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, as they had based some of their questions and answers on entries found in the work. The suit was unsuccessful, as the makers of Trivial Pursuit were able to show that the game was based on questions and answers about facts obtained from a number of sources, and the information was laid out in a way that was demonstrably different from the original &quot;encyclopedia&quot;.

=== Other copyright infringement ===
* In the summer of 2008, the state-owned Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute () suspected that a competing commercial service, the website meteo.sk, was copying their data. (This is legal in most countries, where such data is either offered under a free license or deeded into the public domain, but not in Slovakia.) On 7 August 2008, SHMÚ deliberately altered the temperature for Chopok from 9.5 °C to 1 °C. In a short time, the temperature of 1 °C appeared for Chopok at meteo.sk as well.
* Google, alleging its search results for a misspelling of tarsorrhaphy started appearing in Bing results partway through the summer of 2010, created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like &quot;hiybbprqag&quot;, &quot;delhipublicschool40 chdjob&quot; and &quot;juegosdeben1ogrande&quot; each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage. Nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by Google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on Bing.
* In 2019, media company Genius revealed that they had caught Google reprinting their song lyrics as &quot;Featured Snippets&quot; on top of Google search result pages. The former company used a mix of two different types of apostrophes (curly and straight) in several of their song lyrics. When converted to Morse code, these apostrophes spelled out the phrase &quot;Red Handed&quot;.

== Scrutiny checks ==

Some publications such as those published by Harvard biologist John Bohannon are used to detect lack of academic scrutiny, editorial oversight, fraud, or data dredging on the part of authors or their publishers. Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).

A survey of food tastes by the US Army in the 1970s included &quot;funistrada&quot;, &quot;buttered ermal&quot; and &quot;braised trake&quot; to control for inattentive answers.

In 1985, the fictitious town of Ripton, Massachusetts, was &quot;created&quot; in an effort to protest the ignorance of state officials about rural areas. The town received a budget appropriation and several grants before the hoax was revealed.

== Humorous hoaxes ==

=== Reference publications ===
* The German-language &quot;Der neue Pauly. Enzyklopaedie der Antike&quot;, edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, ) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional Roman sport, &quot;apopudobalia&quot;, which resembles modern association football.
* &quot;Zzxjoanw&quot; was the last entry in Rupert Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Music Lovers&#x27; Encyclopedia&quot; of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a Māori word for a drum. It was proved to be a hoax. The Māori language does not use the letters J, X or Z.
* Most listings of the members of the German parliament feature the fictitious politician Jakob Maria Mierscheid, allegedly a member of the parliament since 1979. Among other activities, he is reported to have contributed to a major symposium on the equally fictitious stone louse in Frankfurt.
* The 1975 &quot;New Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; contains a fictitious entry on &quot;Lillian Virginia Mountweazel&quot; (1942–1973). Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and photographer, best known for &quot;Flags Up!&quot;, a collection of photographs of rural American mailboxes. Supposedly, she was born in Bangs, Ohio, and died in an explosion while on assignment for &quot;Combustibles&quot; magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.
* The first printing in 1980 of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; contains two fictitious entries: on Guglielmo Baldini, a nonexistent Italian composer, and Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, who purportedly composed a small amount of music for flute. Esrum-Hellerup&#x27;s surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in Copenhagen. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.
* The &quot;Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit&quot; includes entries from &quot;Tales of Maghrebinia&quot;, a 1953 collection of short stories by Gregor von Rezzori set in a fictional Balkan country.

=== Practical jokes ===
*Rhinogradentia are a fictitious mammalian order, extensively documented in a series of articles and books by the equally fictitious German naturalist Harald Stümpke. Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of Gerolf Steiner, a zoology professor at the University of Heidelberg.
*Taro Tsujimoto is a fictional character often included in Buffalo Sabres reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager George &quot;Punch&quot; Imlach, designed to fool the National Hockey League during the 1974 NHL amateur draft; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later—well after the pick was made official—admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.
*Franz Bibfeldt is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen&#x27;s classmate Martin Marty as an ongoing injoke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.
*&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; commissioned an April 1, 1985 cover story from George Plimpton on &quot;The Curious Case of Sidd Finch&quot;, a fictitious self-taught baseball player who could pitch a baseball as fast as 168 mph.
* At least two sports teams at Georgia Tech have long included George P. Burdell, a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of lettermen in team media guides:
**Football: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.
**Men&#x27;s basketball: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58 seasons.
*Jean-Baptiste Botul is a fictional French philosopher created in 1995 by the journalist Frédéric Pagès and other members of a group calling itself the Association of the Friends of Jean-Baptiste Botul. Originating as a literary hoax, the names of both Botul and his philosophy of botulism derive from botulism, an often deadly type of food poisoning. The works of Botul have been cited by authors who missed the joke, including most notably TV personality Bernard-Henri Lévy.

=== Puzzles and games ===
*Australian palaeontologist Tim Flannery&#x27;s book &quot;Astonishing Animals&quot; includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.
*The product catalogue for Swedish personal-use electronics and hobby articles retailer Teknikmagasinet contains a fictitious product. Finding that product is a contest, &quot;Blufftävlingen&quot;, in which the best suggestion for another fictitious product from someone who spotted the product gets included in the next issue.
*&quot;Muse&quot;, a US magazine for children 10–14, regularly includes a two-page spread containing science and technology news. One of the news stories is false and readers are encouraged to guess which one.
*&quot;Games&quot; (a magazine devoted to games and puzzles) used to include a fake advertisement in each issue as one of the magazine&#x27;s regular games.
*The book &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot; describes many bizarre and obscure films. The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a hoax, which they challenged readers to identify. The imaginary film was &quot;Dog of Norway&quot;, supposedly starring Muki the Wonder Dog, named after the authors&#x27; own dog. (A clue is that the same dog shown in a purported publicity shot for the 1948 film, also appears next to the authors in the &quot;About The Authors&quot; bio on the back cover.)

== Fictitious entries in works of fiction ==
* Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s short story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tlön, the setting for much of the country&#x27;s literature. Borges went on to invent the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge, purportedly an ancient Chinese encyclopedia, two years later.
* In Cordwainer Smith&#x27;s 1961 short story &quot;Mother Hitton&#x27;s Littul Kittons&quot;, agents of Norstrilia plant a fake article about the titular &quot;kittons&quot; in an encyclopedia consulted by a thief, in order to deceive him about the nature of their planet&#x27;s defenses.
* In the Fred Saberhagen short story, &quot;The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron&quot; a Berserker ship comes to grief after trying to find a nonexistent star system inserted into an encyclopedia to catch plagiarists. 
* Agloe, New York, is a key plot point in John Green&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Paper Towns&quot; and its film adaptation. The novels also references the fictitious entry &quot;Lillian Mountweazel&quot; with the name of the Spiegelman family&#x27;s dog, Myrna Mountweazel.
* In Eley Williams&#x27;s novel &quot;The Liar&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (2020), the protagonist is tasked with hunting down several fictitious entries inserted in Swansby&#x27;s New Encyclopaedic Dictionary before the work is digitized.
* In the &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; episode &quot;Misdirection&quot;, Mountweazel is used to prove the plagiarism of a magic trick.
* The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Face the Raven&quot; revolves around the idea of &quot;trap streets&quot;, in this case located in London.

== Legal action ==
Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to &quot;Feist v. Rural&quot; decision that &quot;information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright&quot;, there are very few cases where copyright has been proven and many are dismissed.

* Fred L. Worth, author of &quot;The Trivia Encyclopedia&quot;, filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game&#x27;s Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.
* In &quot;Nester&#x27;s Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.&quot;, a New York corporation which published and sold &quot;Official New York Taxi Driver&#x27;s Guide&quot; sued Hagstrom Map Corporation for publishing and selling &quot;New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Drivers Guide&quot;, alleging violation of the Copyright Act of 1976. A United States Federal Court found that Nester&#x27;s selection of addresses involved a sufficient level of creativity to be eligible for copyright and enjoined Hagstrom from copying that portion of the guide. However, the court also found that fictitious entries (in this case, a &quot;trap street&quot;) are not themselves protected by copyright.
* In &quot;Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps&quot;, Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the Copyright Act of 1976 by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally, the judge cited &quot;Nester&#x27;s Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.&quot; as previous case law to support that &quot;fictitious names may not be copyrighted&quot; and &quot;the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact.&quot;
* In one particular case, in 2001 The Automobile Association in the United Kingdom agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying Ordnance Survey maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a deliberate copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads.

== Simple errors ==
Often there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as ghost words, &quot;words which have no real existence [...] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors.&quot;

<doc id="535335" wikidata="Q202028" url="?curid=535335" title="War of the Worlds (2005 film)">
<text>War of the Worlds is a 2005 American science fiction action-thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, based on H. G. Wells&#x27; 1898 novel, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Tom Cruise stars in the main role alongside Dakota Fanning, Miranda Otto, and Tim Robbins, with narration by Morgan Freeman. It follows an American dock worker who must look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade Earth and devastate cities with giant war machines.

Produced by Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and Cruise/Wagner Productions, the film was shot in 73 days, using five different sound stages as well as locations in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. It was surrounded by a secrecy campaign so few details would be leaked before its release. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including Hitachi.

&quot;War of the Worlds&quot; was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures on June 29, 2005, and received generally positive reviews. It was praised for effectively capturing the thrilling and suspenseful elements of Wells&#x27; novel while modernizing the action and effects to resonate with contemporary audiences. The film was also a commercial success, grossing over $603 million worldwide, making it the fourth most successful film of 2005. It earned Academy Awards nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing.

==Plot==
A narrator opens the film stating that extraterrestrials with immense intelligence have grown envious of humanity&#x27;s dominion of Earth and are plotting against them.

Divorced longshoreman Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator at a dock in Brooklyn, New York and is estranged from his children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and his teenage son Robbie. Ray&#x27;s pregnant former wife, Mary Ann, drops the two off at his house in Bayonne, New Jersey on her way to visit her parents in Boston, Massachusetts. Later, a strange thunderstorm occurs, during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a nearby intersection, causing an EMP that instantly disables almost all electronic devices. On his way to investigate the impacts, Ray suggests his mechanic friend Manny repair a customer&#x27;s minivan by replacing a solenoid. He joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive &quot;tripod&quot; war machine emerges from the ground following an earthquake and attacks the crowd using energy weapons to disintegrate most of the witnesses into ash.

Ray collects his children and commandeers the van Manny has repaired; he attempts to convince Manny to join them but is forced to leave him behind when a tripod attacks, resulting in Manny&#x27;s death. Ray drives his children to Mary Ann&#x27;s empty suburban New Jersey home to take refuge. Later, a Boeing 747 crashes into the neighborhood. Ray meets a wandering TV news team scavenging the wreckage for food, wherein a correspondent reveals that many tripods have attacked major cities around the world and that they have force shields that protect them from humanity&#x27;s defenses. She adds that the tripods&#x27; pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms to enter their machines, presumed to have been buried underground long ago.

Ray transports his children to Boston to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarms their vehicle, forcing them to abandon it. They eventually get on a ferry crossing over the Hudson River before tripods attack the refugees. Along the way, they then witness a US military counter-offensive against the tripods. To Ray&#x27;s dismay, Robbie joins the futile fight out of hatred for the invaders, leaving Ray and Rachel to flee. The military forces are obliterated, with Robbie presumed dead along with them. Shortly afterward, the pair are offered shelter in a nearby house by a deranged former ambulance driver, Harlan Ogilvy.

The three remain undetected for several hours, even as a tripod&#x27;s probe and a group of aliens explore the basement. They soon discover that the aliens have started cultivating a red-colored vegetation across the landscape that is quickly spreading. Later, Harlan suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing that his mad shouting will alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod probe then catches the Ferriers sleeping, causing Rachel to flee outside only to be abducted by the tripod. Chasing after the tripod, Ray grabs a belt of grenades from an overgrown Humvee, then intentionally allows himself to be abducted. With the help of other abductees, Ray destroys the tripod from within with the grenades.

Ray and Rachel eventually reach Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its force shields have been disabled. He alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down with Javelin missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens, and a pale, sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel finally approach Mary Ann&#x27;s parents&#x27; house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie, who inexplicably survived.

In closing, the narrator explains that the aliens died because they were vulnerable to the countless microbes inhabiting the Earth that humanity has adapted to for millennia.

==Production==

===Development===
After collaborating in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Minority Report&quot;, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were interested in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, &quot;He&#x27;s such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. I love working with Tom Cruise.&quot; Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Spielberg chose &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and stated, &quot;We looked at each other and the lights went on. As soon as I heard it, I said &#x27;Oh my God! &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; – absolutely.&#x27; That was it.&quot;

The film is Spielberg&#x27;s third on the subject of alien visitation, along with &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). Producer and longtime collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. &quot;When we first started developing &quot;E.T.&quot;, it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. Now, he&#x27;s telling that story.&quot; Spielberg stated that he just thought it would be fun to make a &quot;really scary film with really scary aliens&quot;, something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.
J. J. Abrams was asked by Spielberg and Cruise to write the script but had to turn down the film as he was working on the pilot for his television series &quot;Lost&quot;. Josh Friedman delivered a screenplay, which was then rewritten by David Koepp. After re-reading the novel, Koepp decided to do the script following a single narrator, &quot;a very limited point of view, from someone on the very periphery of events rather than someone involved in events&quot;, and created a list of elements he would not use due to being &quot;cliché&quot;, such as the destruction of landmark buildings. Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed: Tim Robbins&#x27; character was an amalgam of two characters in the book, with the name borrowed from a third. While changing the setting from 19th century to present day, Koepp also tried to &quot;take the modern world back to the 1800s&quot;, with the characters being devoid of electricity and modern techniques of communication.

Spielberg accepted the script after finding it had several similarities to his personal life, including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann&#x27;s divorce), and because the plight of the fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks. For Spielberg, the characters&#x27; stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the American mindset of never giving up. Spielberg described &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; as &quot;a polar opposite&quot; to &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; focused on keeping the family together. At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored, as &quot;we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves&quot;.

Although accepting the script, Spielberg asked for several changes. Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in spaceships, since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle. The original Martian cylinders were discarded and Spielberg replaced the origins of the tripods, stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago.

Spielberg had Miranda Otto in mind for the part of Mary Ann, but at the time he called her she was pregnant and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto&#x27;s pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.

===Filming===
Filming took place in Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, and New York. The film shooting lasted an estimated 73 days. Spielberg originally intended to shoot &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; after &quot;Munich&quot; (2005), but Tom Cruise liked David Koepp&#x27;s script so much that he suggested Spielberg postpone the former while he would do the same with &quot;&quot; (2006). Most of &quot;Munich&quot; crew was brought in to work on &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; as well. In 2004, the production crews quickly were set up on both coasts to prepare for the start date, scouting locations up and down the Eastern Seaboard and preparing stages and sets which would be used when the company returned to Los Angeles after the winter holiday. Pre-production took place in only three months, essentially half the amount of time normally allotted for a film of similar size and scope. Spielberg notes, however, &quot;This wasn&#x27;t a cram course for &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. This was my longest schedule in about 12 years. We took our time.&quot; Spielberg collaborated with crews at the beginning of pre-production with the use of previsualization, considering the tight schedule.

The scene depicting the first appearance of the Tripods was filmed at the intersection of Ferry Street, Merchant Street, and Wilson Avenue, in Newark, New Jersey. Later, Spielberg filmed several scenes in Virginia.

The ferry scene was filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann&#x27;s parents&#x27; house was located in Brooklyn (but was featured in the film as Boston). For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747 formerly operated by All Nippon Airways as JA8147, with transportation costs of $2 million, dismantled it into several pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ferrier&#x27;s house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at an abandoned chemical plant. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit directed by Vic Armstrong using a stand in for Dakota Fanning shot from behind with the portion showing the faces of the credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, New York. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.

Principal photography began on November 8, 2004 and wrapped on March 7, 2005.

===Design and visual effects===
Industrial Light &amp; Magic was the main special effects company for the movie. While Spielberg had used computers to help visualize sequences in pre-production before, Spielberg said, &quot;This is the first film I really tackled using the computer to animate all the storyboards.&quot; He decided to employ the technique extensively after a visit to his friend George Lucas. In order to keep the realism, the usage of computer-generated imagery shots and bluescreen was limited, with most of the digital effects being blended with miniature and live-action footage.

The design of the Tripods was described by Spielberg as &quot;graceful,&quot; with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing a tribute to the original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested in the aliens inside than in the vehicle itself. The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the &quot;contradiction&quot; of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a &quot;terrestrial buoyance&quot;, in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like &quot;scary ballet dancers&quot;. Most of the alien elements revolved around the number threethe Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each.

Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering &quot;Steven wanted to make sure that these creatures were 150 feet tall&quot;, as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs, and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, &quot;this was going to be a horror movie for kids&quot;. So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. Digital birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that &quot;you don&#x27;t know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away.&quot;

During the scene where Ferrier&#x27;s stolen minivan is attacked by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL&amp;M crew admitted that the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray toward the minivan; the minivan&#x27;s escape involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.

Costume designer Joanna Johnston created 60 different versions of Ferrier&#x27;s leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered from the beginning of the journey to the end. &quot;He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts,&quot; explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning&#x27;s costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: &quot;I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face,&quot; Johnston notes. &quot;That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times.&quot; Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, &quot;They&#x27;re more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface,&quot; Johnston says.

===Music===

Longtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams composed the score. It was the first time he had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling 60 minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. He considered the score &quot;a very serious piece,&quot; which had to combine &quot;necessary frightening atmosphere&quot; with &quot;propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes&quot;⁠the music would be symbolically &quot;pulling forward&quot; vehicles in chase scenes, such as Ferrier driving out of Bayonne, or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a &quot;grand gesture&quot; in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness of the Tripod attacks, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek, representing &quot;victims that go out without saying an &#x27;ouch&#x27;⁠they&#x27;re gone before they can say that&quot;. He added a nearly inaudible male choirwhich he compared to &quot;Tibetan monks, the lowest known pitch our bodies can make&quot;, for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations.

A soundtrack album was released by Decca Records featuring the film&#x27;s music and Morgan Freeman&#x27;s opening and closing narrations. The songs &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; and &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot; are also featured in the movie, the former sung by Tom Cruise, and the latter by Dakota Fanning. An expanded &quot;limited edition&quot; soundtrack was released in 2020 through Intrada Records, with the full film score, a remaster of the 2005 album, and alternate cues as bonus material.

===Themes===
The film was described as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described the film as &quot;If aliens invade, don&#x27;t fight back. Run.&quot; Saunders compared the film to &quot;Independence Day&quot;, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers felt that the film tried to recreate the atmosphere of the September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: &quot;They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life.&quot; Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip⁠&quot;I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you&#x27;re that age you don&#x27;t fully consider the ramifications of what you&#x27;re doing and you&#x27;re very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that&#x27;s a good idea or not.&quot; Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men&#x27;s weapons, but the planet&#x27;s smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as &quot;nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do&quot;.

Lawrence Brown wrote: &quot;Spielberg&#x27;s decision to present the invaders&#x27; fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book. In Spielberg&#x27;s version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itselfa very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbersand then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of usall humans over the whole of historyhave been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be &#x27;harvested.

==Release==
&quot;War of the Worlds&quot; premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on June 23, 2005. There, Tom Cruise revealed his relationship with Katie Holmes. Six days later, on June 29, the film was released in approximately 3,908 theaters across America. The home video was released on November 22, 2005.

===Secrecy===
Spielberg kept most of the parts secret in the filmmaking, as the cast and crew were left confused about how the aliens looked. When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, &quot;[Spielberg] wouldn&#x27;t give [the screenplay] to &quot;anybody&quot;.&quot; Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, &quot;I know some people who always say, &#x27;Oh, everything&#x27;s so secret.&#x27; I think it&#x27;s good. In the old days people didn&#x27;t get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there&#x27;s just so much information. I think a bit of mystery is always really good. You don&#x27;t want to blow all of your cards beforehand.&quot;

Spielberg admitted after keeping things secret for so long, there is in the end the temptation to reveal too much to the detriment of the story at the press conference of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. So, Spielberg only revealed the hill scene, where Ferrier tries to stop his son from leaving, stating &quot;to say more would reveal too much.&quot; The actual budget of the film was $132 million.

According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Spielberg&#x27;s relations with Cruise were &quot;poor&quot; during the film&#x27;s release because Spielberg believed Cruise&#x27;s &quot;antics&quot; at the time (such as an erratic appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show) had &quot;hurt&quot; the film; also, a doctor whose name Spielberg had given to Cruise was picketed by Scientologists.

===Marketing and home media releases===
Paramount Pictures Interactive Marketing debuted a human survival online game on its official website on April 14 to promote the film. Hitachi collaborated with Paramount Pictures for a worldwide promotional campaign, under the title of &quot;The Ultimate Visual Experience&quot;. The agreement was announced by Kazuhiro Tachibana, general manager of Hitachi&#x27;s Consumer Business Group. Kazuhiro stated, &quot;Our &#x27;The Ultimate Visual Experience&#x27; campaign is a perfect match between Spielberg and Cruise&#x27;s pursuit of the world&#x27;s best in film entertainment and Hitachi&#x27;s commitment to the highest picture quality through its digital consumer electronic products.&quot;

The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 22, 2005, with both a single-disc edition and a two-disc special edition which included production featurettes, documentaries and various trailers. The film grossed $113 million in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $704,745,540, ranking tenth place in the 2005 DVD sales chart. Paramount released the film on Blu-ray Disc on June 1, 2010.

==Reception==

===Box office===
On , the film grossed $81 million worldwide, and earned the 38th-biggest opening week by grossing $98.8 million in 3,908 theaters, an average of $25,288. On Independence Day weekend, it grossed $64.9 million, an average of $16,601, and gave Tom Cruise his biggest opening weekend, until the release of &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; in May 2022. It was the second-biggest film opening on Independence Day weekend, after &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. During its first five days of release, it made $100.2 million, breaking &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;″s record to become the fastest Steven Spielberg film to reach $100 million. It earned $200 million in 24 days, ranking 37th in the list of fastest films to gross $200 million. It went on to make a total gross of $603.9 million worldwide. The film would remain as Tom Cruise&#x27;s highest-grossing film until 2011 when it was dethroned by &quot;&quot;. Overall, it was the fourth highest-grossing film of 2005.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; holds an approval rating of 76% based on 264 reviews, and an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells&#x27; classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.&quot; Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the film an average score of 73 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

James Berardinelli praised the acting and considered that focusing the narrative on the struggle of one character made the film more effective, but described the ending as weak, even though Spielberg &quot;does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic&quot;. &quot;Total Film&quot; review gave &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; four out of five stars, considering that &quot;Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record&quot;, and describing the film as having many &quot;startling images&quot;, comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Kenneth Turan, who commended the film&#x27;s special effects, stated that Spielberg may actually have done his job in &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; &quot;better than he realizes&quot;. Turan claimed that, by &quot;showing us how fragile our world is&quot;, Spielberg raises a provocative question: &quot;Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, or is it the survival of the human race?&quot; However, &quot;Broomfield Enterprise&quot; Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi did not share Berardinelli and Turan&#x27;s opinion. They felt that Morgan Freeman&#x27;s narration was unnecessary, and that the first half was &quot;great&quot; but the second half &quot;became filled with clichés, riddled with holes, and tainted by Tim Robbins&quot;.

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing &quot;&quot;War of the Worlds&quot; definitely wins its battle, but not the war.&quot; Wilmington stated that the film &quot;takes [viewers] on a wild journey through two sides of [Spielberg]: the dark and the light.&quot; He also said the film contained a core sentiment similar to that of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. About.com&#x27;s Rebecca Murray gave a positive review, stating, &quot;Spielberg almost succeeds in creating the perfect alien movie&quot;, with criticism only for the ending.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised the special effects and Cruise&#x27;s performance. Roger Ebert criticized the &quot;retro design&quot; and considered that despite the big budget, the alien invasion was &quot;rudimentary&quot; and &quot;not very interesting&quot;, regarding the best scenes as Ferrier walking among the airliner wreckage and a train running in flames, declaring that &quot;such scenes seem to come from a kind of reality different from that of the tripods.&quot;

The French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; ranked the film as 8th place in its list of best films of the 2000s. It is also Spielberg&#x27;s first film to make the magazine&#x27;s annual listings of the top 10 films of the year, which would be followed by &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), &quot;The Post&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022). Japanese film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa listed the film as the best film of 2000–2009.

===Accolades===

<doc id="535347" wikidata="Q543293" url="?curid=535347" title="Ezio Pinza">
<text>Ezio Fortunato Pinza (May 18, 1892May 9, 1957) was an Italian opera singer. Pinza possessed a rich, smooth and sonorous voice, with a flexibility unusual for a bass. He spent 22 seasons at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera, appearing in more than 750 performances of 50 operas. At the San Francisco Opera, Pinza sang 26 roles during 20 seasons from 1927 to 1948. Pinza also sang to great acclaim at La Scala, Milan, and at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.

After retiring from the Metropolitan Opera in 1948, Pinza enjoyed a fresh career on Broadway in musical theatre, most notably in &quot;South Pacific&quot;, in which he created the role of Emile de Becque. He was less successful in his appearances in Hollywood films.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Ezio Fortunato Pinza was born in modest circumstances in Rome in 1892. The seventh child born to his parents, he was the first to live past infancy. Pinza grew up on Italy&#x27;s east coast, in the ancient city of Ravenna. He studied singing at Bologna&#x27;s Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini, making his operatic debut at age 22 in 1914, as Oroveso in &quot;Norma&quot; at Cremona.
As a young man, Pinza was a devotee of bicycle racing. &quot;Although I did not know it at the time,&quot; he told an interviewer years later, &quot;I was developing the lung power which now makes people hear my voice even in the top row of the peanut gallery.&quot; He also undertook four years of military service during World War I, prior to resuming his operatic career in Rome in 1919. He was then invited to sing at Italy&#x27;s foremost opera house, La Scala, Milan, making his début there in February 1922. At La Scala, under the direction of the brilliant and exacting principal conductor Arturo Toscanini, Pinza&#x27;s career blossomed during the course of the next few seasons. He became a popular favourite of critics and audiences due to the high quality of his singing and the attractiveness of his stage presence.

Although he attended the Bologna Conservatory, Pinza never learned to read music; he learned all his music by ear. He would listen to his part played on the piano and then sing it accurately. Pinza succeeded the great Italian basses Francesco Navarini and Vittorio Arimondi, both of whom enjoyed international opera careers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and Nazzareno De Angelis, who arrived on the scene in the early 1900s. Another of his eminent predecessors in the Italian operatic repertoire was the Spaniard José Mardones, who had appeared regularly with the Boston and Metropolitan opera companies between 1909 and 1926. Tancredi Pasero, whose vibrant voice sounded remarkably similar to Pinza&#x27;s, was his chief contemporary rival among Italian-born basses. Pasero, however, lacked Pinza&#x27;s handsome looks and magnetic personality. 

=== Operatic success ===
Pinza&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera debut occurred in November 1926 in Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot;, with famed American soprano Rosa Ponselle in the title role. In 1929, he sang Don Giovanni, a role with which he was subsequently to become closely identified. He subsequently added the Mozart roles Figaro (in 1940) and Sarastro (in 1942) to his repertoire, a vast number of Italian operatic roles of Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi, and Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (sung in Italian). Apart from the Met, Pinza appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1930–1939, and was invited to sing at the Salzburg Festival in 1934–1937 by the celebrated German conductor Bruno Walter.

Pinza sang once again under the baton of Toscanini in 1935, this time with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, as the bass soloist in performances of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;. One of these performances was broadcast by CBS and preserved on transcription discs; this recording has been issued on LP and CD. He also sang in Toscanini&#x27;s February 6, 1938, NBC Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s broadcast performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. These performances both took place in Carnegie Hall. In October 1947, he performed the role of Méphistophélès in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; opposite his daughter, soprano Claudia Pinza Bozzolla, as Marguerite at the San Francisco Opera.

Pinza resigned from the Metropolitan Opera in 1948. He had sung opposite many celebrated singers at the Met during his heyday, including, among others, such international stars as Rosa Ponselle, Amelita Galli-Curci, Elisabeth Rethberg, Maria Jeritza, Giovanni Martinelli, Beniamino Gigli, Lawrence Tibbett, and Giuseppe De Luca. The Metropolitan Opera honored Pinza by dedicating all the water fountains at the new Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center) to him. Before his retirement from opera, his repertoire consisted of around 95 roles.

===Arrest and detention by FBI===

In March 1942, the FBI arrested Pinza at his New York home and unjustly detained him along with hundreds of other Italian-Americans who were suspected of supporting the Axis during the second World War. Pinza spent nearly three months in custody at Ellis Island. Norman Cordon, a fellow basso at the Metropolitan Opera who was considered one of Pinza&#x27;s rivals, boasted privately that he had informed the FBI that Pinza was a fascist sympathizer. At the time of Pinza&#x27;s detention, he was just four months away from obtaining US citizenship. The incident was extremely traumatic for Pinza, and he suffered from periods of severe depression for years afterward. Despite this, shortly after his release from Ellis Island, Pinza and Cordon performed together at the Met in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, with Pinza in the title role and Cordon as the Commendatore.

===Later years and death===
After Pinza&#x27;s resignation from the Metropolitan 
Opera in 1948, he embarked on a second career in Broadway musicals. In April 1949, he appeared in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot;, originating the role of French planter Emile de Becque. His highly expressive performance of the hit song &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; transformed Pinza into a matinée idol and a national celebrity. He said: &quot;For 20 years I sang in grand opera and nobody knew me; I sang one night in &quot;South Pacific&quot; and I can&#x27;t walk down the street without being mobbed.&quot; In 1950, he received a Tony Award for best lead actor in a musical.

Pinza became a member of Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York, and lived in a house adjacent to the fifth golf hole of the South Course. In 1953, he had his own short-lived NBC situation comedy on TV, &quot;Bonino&quot;. In 1954, he appeared in the Broadway production of &quot;Fanny&quot; opposite Florence Henderson. On March 28, 1954, Pinza and Henderson were featured in the TV special &quot;General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot; which was broadcast on all four American TV networks of the time.

Pinza&#x27;s health began to decline during the mid-1950s; a series of heart attacks precipitated a stroke on May 1, 1957. Pinza died in his sleep of a heart attack on May 9, at the age of 64 in Stamford, Connecticut. His funeral was held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. He is interred at Putnam Cemetery, in Greenwich, Connecticut. Shortly before his death, Pinza completed his memoirs, which were published in 1958 by Rinehart &amp; Company. Photos taken during his career, as well as images of his family, were included in the book.

===Personal life===
Pinza was married twice. With his first wife, Augusta Cassinelli, he had a daughter, Claudia Pinza Bozzolla, who became a celebrated opera singer, vocal coach, and director herself. After divorcing Cassinelli, in 1940 he married Doris Leak, described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a member of the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s corps de ballet.&quot; They had three children: Clelia, Pietro, and Gloria. Clelia&#x27;s daughter, journalist Sarah Goodyear, wrote about her grandfather&#x27;s wartime struggles in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 2000.

==Films and television==
Pinza appeared in several films, beginning with 1947&#x27;s &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;, which featured a number of famous classical singers, musicians, conductors, and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He received a film contract from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and appeared in &quot;Mr. Imperium&quot; with Lana Turner and &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot; with Janet Leigh, both released in 1951; MGM cancelled his contract after both films turned out to be major box office failures. His final big-screen appearance was in the Twentieth Century-Fox film &quot;Tonight We Sing&quot; (1953), playing the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin in a movie biography of impresario Sol Hurok. In this film, Pinza sings a portion of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in the original Russian. A recording of Pinza singing &quot;Anema e core&quot; is heard in the film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), playing on a phonograph in the scene where Jake and Elwood visit landlady, Mrs. Tarantino.

Pinza hosted &quot;The RCA Victor Show&quot; during 1951–52, which for a time alternated with &quot;The RCA Victor Show Starring Dennis Day&quot;, later named &quot;The Dennis Day Show&quot;. In 1953, he starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Bonino&quot;. Pinza continued to make appearances on American television until 1955.

==Recordings==
Pinza recorded extensively for The Gramophone Company/EMI and the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor during his prime in the 1920s and 1930s. These 78-rpm discs consist largely of individual operatic arias and some ensemble pieces (plus a complete &quot;Verdi Requiem&quot; conducted by Carlo Sabajno in 1927, and another with Tullio Serafin in 1939). They are prized by music critics and general listeners alike for the exceptional beauty of voice and the fine musicianship that Pinza displays on them. Most of them were reissued on LP, and today they are available on many CD reissues.

Pinza was still making operatic recordings in the 1950s, although his voice was now in obvious decline. In the mid-1940s, he had recorded for Columbia Records. He occasionally recorded popular songs, and was featured on Columbia&#x27;s best-selling original cast recording of &quot;South Pacific&quot; with Mary Martin. Pinza returned to RCA Victor in the early 1950s and recorded several operatic arias and popular songs. Pinza can also be heard on the RCA Victor original cast album of &quot;Fanny&quot;, recorded in 1954.
