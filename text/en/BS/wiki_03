<text>The Naval War College (NWC or NAVWARCOL) is the staff college and &quot;Home of Thought&quot; for the United States Navy at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. The NWC educates and develops leaders, supports defining the future Navy and associated roles and missions, supports combat readiness, and strengthens global maritime partnerships.

The Naval War College is one of the senior service colleges including the Army War College, the Marine Corps War College, and the USAF Air War College. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense operates the National War College.

==History==
The college was established on October 6, 1884; its first president, Commodore Stephen B. Luce, was given the old building of the Newport Asylum for the Poor to house it on Coasters Harbor Island in Narragansett Bay. Among the first four faculty members were Tasker H. Bliss, a future Army Chief of Staff, James R. Soley, the first civilian faculty member and a future Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and, most famously, Captain (later, Rear Admiral) Alfred Thayer Mahan, who soon became renowned for the scope of his strategic thinking and influence on naval leaders worldwide.

The College engaged in wargaming various scenarios from 1887 on, and in time became a laboratory for the development of war plans. Nearly all of the U.S. naval operations of the twentieth century were originally designed and gamed at the NWC.

More than 50,000 students have graduated since its first class of 9 students in 1885 and about 300 of today&#x27;s active duty admirals, and generals and senior executive service leaders are alumni. The college&#x27;s joint professional military education (JPME) programs prepare leaders for the challenges of operational and strategic leadership over the remainder of their careers as decision makers and problem solvers. More than 1,900 students have graduated from the Maritime Staff Operators Course, 200 from the Executive Level OLW Course, and more than 450 U.S. and international flag and general officers from the Flag Course. Just as its educational programs have expanded in depth and reach, so have the research and analysis efforts conducted by its Center for Naval Warfare Studies. Through war games, conferences, workshops, and publications, its research arm provides direct curriculum support to its educational programs and focused, task-driven analysis for fleet customers and government agencies across the national security spectrum.

==Academic programs==

===College of Naval Command and Staff===
The College of Naval Command and Staff (CNCS) is a multidisciplinary program designed for U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard officers in the grade of lieutenant commander, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, and U.S. Air Force officers in the grade of major, and civilians of equivalent seniority from various federal agencies. This intermediate level service college course provides an initial opportunity for joint professional military education wherein students prepare for increased responsibilities as commanders / lieutenant colonels, and as junior captains / colonels.

College of Naval Command and Staff students pursue studies in each of the Naval War College&#x27;s three core subject areas in the following order of presentation: Strategy and War, Theater Security Decision Making, and Joint Maritime Operations. While this basic curriculum is essentially the same as that of the more senior students enrolled in the College of Naval Warfare, individual courses are tailored to the experience level and career needs of the CNCS&#x27;s mid-grade officers. Each student in the College of Naval Command and Staff is also required to enroll in one Elective Program course of his or her choice per trimester. A limited number of students may, with selection committee approval, forego up to one trimester of the core curriculum to participate in the Center for Naval Warfare Studies&#x27; Advanced Research Program.

Beginning in 1914, NWC imparts its competent, executive-level programs beyond campus through its, now web-based, College of Distance Education (CDE). The three main CDE courses are Strategy and War, Theater Security Decision Making, and Joint Maritime Operations.

===Maritime Advanced Warfighting School (MAWS)===

Originally established in 1998 as the Naval Operational Planner Course, the Maritime Advanced Warfighting School (MAWS) is a 13-month program that educates U.S. officers of all services to:

* Be operational planners and ultimately, operational leaders 
* Understand and apply maritime power effectively 
* Form and lead Operational Planning Teams (OPTs) 
* Think creatively and critically by developing solutions to complex, chaotic security problems

MAWS integrates the College of Naval Command and Staff core curriculum with specialized education and hands-on, real-world projects in the operational planning domain. MAWS is the U.S. Navy&#x27;s peer school to the U.S. Army&#x27;s School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS), the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW), the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), and the Joint Forces Staff College&#x27;s Joint Advanced Warfighting School (JAWS).

=== National Security Affairs Department ===
The National Security Affairs Department (NSA) curricula provide military officers and federal government civilians a foundation in contemporary security studies to analyze how the U.S. government makes foreign policy decisions and the role the U.S. plays in the world. This includes: the ability to develop and communicate analyses of current and emerging security issues facing the U.S. and its international partners and allies, the understanding of U.S. decision making dynamics at the strategic level, and the ability to assess political, budgetary, bureaucratic, organizational, and leadership factors influencing decision making and implementation of U.S. foreign policy and strategy development.  In support of the Naval Command and Staff College, it teaches Theater Security Decision Making and in support of the College of Naval Warfare, it teaches National Security Decision Making.

===College of Naval Warfare===
The College of Naval Warfare is a multidisciplinary program designed for U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard officers in the grades of commander or captain, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force officers in the grades of lieutenant colonel or colonel, and civilians of equivalent seniority from various federal agencies. This senior level professional military education program provides students with executive-level preparation for higher responsibilities as senior captains / colonels and as junior flag officers / general officers.

College of Naval Warfare students pursue studies in each of the Naval War College&#x27;s three core subject areas in the following order of presentation: Joint Military Operations, Strategy and Policy, and National Security Decision Making. During all trimesters, College of Naval Warfare students are joined in lectures and in seminars by international students of the Naval Command College. Each College of Naval Warfare student is also required to enroll in one Elective Program course of his or her choice per trimester. A limited number of students in each class may, with selection committee approval, forego up to one trimester of the core curriculum to participate in the Center for Naval Warfare Studies&#x27; Advanced Research Program.

==Accreditation and degrees==
The Naval War College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). It was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges from 1984 until 2018, when the Association&#x27;s university accreditation body split off and became NECHE. In 1990 the Naval War College earned the authority to award to students in some of its programs a Master of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies. Naval War College students are also permitted to transfer up to 18 credits to the Graduate Program in International Relations at Salve Regina University. The arrangement allows Naval War College students to complete a Master of Arts degree in International Relations from Salve Regina University by taking six additional courses.

==Publications==
The Naval War College Press has published the scholarly quarterly journal the &quot;Naval War College Review&quot; since 1948. It also publishes the &quot;Newport Papers&quot;, as well as an historical monograph series and occasional books.

==Research and instruction==
The Henry E. Eccles Library, housed in Hewitt Hall, supports the Naval War College&#x27;s mission by providing information literacy training, reference tutorials and assistance, electronic literature searches, and access to over 90 databases, and interlibrary loan services to Professional Military Education/Joint Professional Military Education, faculty research and analysis, and College of Distance Education.

The library also aids curricula development by assisting faculty research, publishing bibliographies and research guides covering a wide range of topics of interest for those studying international relations, foreign area studies, contemporary and historical military topics, and security studies.

The Naval Historical Collection (NHC) is the depository for the Naval War College archives, manuscripts, oral histories, and special collections relating to the history of naval warfare and the history of the U.S. Navy in Narragansett Bay. Established in 1969 and located in Mahan Hall, the NHC&#x27;s primary source material are of interest to naval historians, scholars, and students of American military and diplomatic history, Naval War College students, faculty and staff, and the general public.

==Buildings and structures==

Over the years, the Naval War College has expanded greatly. The original building, the former Newport Asylum for the Poor, now serves as home to the Naval War College Museum. In 1892, Luce Hall was opened as the college&#x27;s new home, at a cost of $100,000. At the time, the building housed lecture rooms and a library. Wings at either end provided two sets of quarters, occupied by the president of the College and members of the faculty. When the Naval War College was enlarged in 1932, this original building was renamed Luce Hall in honor of the institution&#x27;s founder and first Superintendent (later President), Stephen B. Luce. This original pair of buildings was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Luce Hall was again listed on the National Register in 1972.

Mahan Hall, named after Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan (NWC President from 1886–1889 and 1892–1893), was completed and opened in 1904, and encompasses the historic Mahan Rotunda and Reading Room, as well as student study areas. The Mahan Rotunda also serves as an impromptu museum of gifts and artifacts donated by graduating international students over the years.

Pringle Hall (named after Vice Admiral Joel R. P. Pringle, Naval War College President from 1927–1930) was opened in 1934, and was the principal site for war gaming from the time of its completion in 1934 until the Naval Electronic Warfare Simulator was built in Sims Hall in 1957. The exterior facing of the building is pink Milford granite, similar in appearance to the ashlar granite of Luce Hall, to which it is connected by two enclosed bridges. Pringle Hall contains a 432-seat auditorium, the Quinn Lecture Room, the Naval Staff College, the Graphic Arts Studio, the Photography Branch, and the Naval War College Press.

In 1947, the Naval War College acquired an existing barracks building and converted it to a secondary war gaming facility, naming it Sims Hall after former War College President Admiral William Sowden Sims (Naval War College President from February to April 1917 and again from 1919–1922). In 1957 Sims Hall became the primary center for the Naval War College&#x27;s wargaming department, serving as such until 1999. Sims Hall is undergoing renovations that are expected to be completed in 2021.

The 1970s saw the War College&#x27;s most active expansion, with the opening of three separate buildings. In 1972, Spruance Hall, named after former NWC President Admiral Raymond A. Spruance (March 1946 – July 1948), was completed, housing faculty offices and an 1,100 seat auditorium.

Spruance Hall subsequently became the primary venue for major lectures and cultural events on the Naval War College campus. On one notable occasion, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, March 17, 1975, Johnny Cash with The Tennessee Three along wiht June Carter Cash and Carl Lee Perkins performed a live concert at Spruance Auditorium. Before taking the stage, Cash also warmed up with June and Perkins under the historic rotunda in Mahan Hall. The recording of this &quot;lost concert&quot; of Johnny Cash show was donated by Captain Roy Cash, Jr., who later collaborated with Naval War College historian, David Kohnen, to write the account of the lost concert, which had previously remained undocumented in the official chronology of performances by Johnny Cash.

That same year, in 1974, Admiral Julien LeBourgeois organized a series of initiatives, which focused upon the cultural influence of the Naval War College upon civil-military policy. 
In conjunction with those efforts, LeBourgeois hosted several symposia to highlight the interrelationships between the American public and the future role of the navy in securing global peace. His efforts coincided with broader expansions in the Naval War College mission during the closing phases of operations in the Vietnam War.

At that time, Conolly Hall was opened and named in honor of Admiral Richard L. Conolly, Naval War College President 1950–1953. It houses the NWC Quarterdeck, Administrative and faculty offices, numerous class and conference rooms, and two underground parking garages.

1976 saw the opening of Hewitt Hall, one of two Naval War College buildings not named after a War College president, this time taking its name from Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, an advisor to the Naval War College during his tenure as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe, following World War II. Hewitt Hall is home to the Henry E. Eccles Library, the Trident Café, the bookstore and barbershop, and student study areas and lounge.

In 1999, the state-of-the-art McCarty Little Hall opened, replacing Sims Hall as the War College&#x27;s primary wargaming facility. The other building named after a non-president is named after Captain William McCarty Little, an influential leader and key figure in refining the techniques of war gaming. This high-tech facility is used primarily by the Center for Naval Warfare Studies to conduct war games and major conferences, and for research and analysis. The building features the technology necessary to support a variety of multi-media needs essential during multiple and simultaneous war games.

== Partnership with Brown University ==

On June 6, 2014, NWC and Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International Studies signed a Research and Education Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two institutions. The agreement promotes collaborative research and teaching between NWC and Brown, serves as an opportunity to establish and conduct programs to improve education in science-related fields to meet long-term national defense needs, and establishes cooperative education programs for undergraduate education at Brown and postgraduate education at both Brown and NWC.

<text>John Sevier (September 23, 1745 September 24, 1815) was an American soldier, frontiersman, and politician, and one of the founding fathers of the State of Tennessee. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he played a leading role in Tennessee&#x27;s pre-statehood period, both militarily and politically, and he was elected the state&#x27;s first governor in 1796. He served as a colonel of the Washington District Regiment in the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780, and he commanded the frontier militia in dozens of battles against the Cherokee in the 1780s and 1790s.

Sevier settled in the Tennessee Valley frontier in the 1770s. In 1776, he was elected one of five magistrates of the Watauga Association and helped defend Fort Watauga against an assault by the Cherokee. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he was chosen as a member of the Committee of Safety for the association&#x27;s successor, the Washington District. Following the Battle of Kings Mountain, he led an invasion that destroyed several Cherokee towns in northern Georgia. In the 1780s, he served as the only governor of the State of Franklin, an early attempt at statehood by the trans-Appalachian settlers. He was brigadier general of the Southwest Territory militia during the early 1790s.

Sevier served six two-year terms as Tennessee&#x27;s governor: from 1796 until 1801, and from 1803 to 1809. Term limits prevented a fourth consecutive term in both instances. His political career was marked by a growing rivalry with rising politician Andrew Jackson, which nearly culminated in a duel in 1803. After his last term as governor, Sevier was elected to three terms in the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee, serving from 1811 until his death in 1815.

==Early life==
Sevier was born in 1745 in Augusta County in the Colony of Virginia, near the present-day town of New Market (Sevier&#x27;s birthplace is now part of modern-day Rockingham County).

John Sevier was the oldest of seven children of Valentine Sevier and Joanna Goad. His father, who was of Spanish ancestry (the surname Sevier was an anglicization of the Portuguese &quot;Xavier&quot;), had immigrated from England to Baltimore in 1740 and gradually made his way to the back country and Shenandoah Valley. One of his brothers, Valentine Sevier, became a frontiersman, Revolutionary War officer, and the builder of the Sevier Station frontier outpost.

Sevier&#x27;s father worked variously as a tavern keeper, fur trader, and land speculator; young John pursued similar work. At an early age he opened his own tavern, and he helped found New Market. The town claims Sevier as its founder.

In 1761 at age 16, Sevier married Sarah Hawkins and initially settled into a life of farming. Some sources suggest Sevier served as a captain in the Virginia colonial militia, under George Washington, in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1773 and 1774.

==Watauga Association and Washington District==
In the early 1770s, Sevier and his brother Valentine began making trips to various settlements on the trans-Appalachian frontier, in what is now northeastern Tennessee. In late 1773, Sevier moved his family to the Carter Valley settlements along the Holston River. Three years later, he relocated further south to the Watauga settlements, in what is now Elizabethton, Tennessee. The Wataugans had leased their lands from the Cherokee in 1772 and had formed a fledgling government known as the Watauga Association. Sevier was appointed clerk of the Association&#x27;s five-man court in 1775 and was elected to the court in 1776.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade English settlement on Indian lands west of the Appalachian Mountains. As the Watauga settlements were in Cherokee territory, the British colonial officials considered them illegal. In March 1775, the settlers purchased the lands from the Cherokee, with Sevier listed as a witness to the agreement. The British refused to recognize the purchase, however, and continued to demand that the settlers leave. A band of Cherokee led by Dragging Canoe disagreed with the tribe&#x27;s sale of communal lands, and began making threats against the settlers.

==American Revolutionary War==
With the outbreak of the American Revolution, in April 1775, the Wataugans, most of whom were sympathetic to the Patriot cause, organized the Washington District and formed a 13-member Committee of Safety. The committee, which included Sevier, submitted the &quot;Watauga Petition&quot; to Virginia in the spring of 1776, formally asking to be annexed, but Virginia refused. (Historian J. G. M. Ramsey suggested Sevier wrote the petition, but later historians reject this). The Wataugans then petitioned North Carolina.

Fearing an invasion by Dragging Canoe, who was receiving arms from the British, the Overmountain settlers built Fort Caswell (commonly called Fort Watauga) to guard the Watauga settlements, and Eaton&#x27;s Station to guard the Holston settlements. Sevier had begun building Fort Lee to guard settlements in the Nolichucky Valley. After receiving word of an impending Cherokee invasion from Nancy Ward, the Nolichucky settlers fled to Fort Caswell, and Sevier soon followed.

The Cherokee attacks began in mid-July 1776. Dragging Canoe went north to attack the Holston settlements, while a detachment led by Old Abraham of Chilhowee invaded the Watauga settlements. On July 21, Old Abraham&#x27;s forces reached Fort Caswell, which was garrisoned by 75 militia commanded by John Carter, with Sevier and James Robertson as subordinates. Catherine Sherrill, Sevier&#x27;s future wife, failed to make it into the fort before the gate was locked, but Sevier managed to reach over the palisades and pull her to safety. The fort&#x27;s garrison beat back the Cherokee assault, and after a two-week siege, Old Abraham retreated. The Cherokee eventually sued for peace following an invasion of the Overhill country by William Christian in October 1776.

The Wataugans sent five delegates, among them Sevier, to North Carolina&#x27;s constitutional convention in November 1776. The new constitution created the &quot;District of Washington,&quot; which included most of modern Tennessee. The new district elected Sevier to one of its two seats in the state&#x27;s House of Representatives. The district became Washington County, North Carolina in 1777. Sevier was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the new county&#x27;s Washington County Regiment of militia.

===Battle of Kings Mountain===
Following the British victory, at the Battle of Camden, in August 1780, a detachment of Loyalists, under Major Patrick Ferguson, was dispatched to suppress Patriot activity in the mountains. After routing a small force, under Charles McDowell, Ferguson sent a message to the Overmountain settlements, warning them that if they refused to lay down their arms, he would march over the mountains and &quot;lay waste the country with fire and sword.&quot; Sevier and Sullivan County militia colonel Isaac Shelby agreed to raise armies and march across the mountains to engage Ferguson.

On September 25, 1780, the Overmountain Men, as they came to be called, gathered at Sycamore Shoals to prepare for the march. This force consisted of 240 Washington County militia commanded by Sevier, 240 Sullivan County militia commanded by Shelby, and 400 Virginians commanded by William Campbell. To provide funds for the march, Sevier obtained a loan from John Adair, putting up his own property as collateral. The combined force departed across the mountains on September 26, eventually linking up with the remnants of McDowell&#x27;s men.

On October 7, the Overmountain Men caught up with and surrounded Ferguson, who had entrenched his Loyalist forces atop Kings Mountain, near the present-day North Carolina-South Carolina border. Sevier&#x27;s men comprised part of the south flank, along with the forces of Campbell and McDowell. Patriot forces initially failed to break through the Loyalist lines, but the frontier sharpshooters gradually decimated the American Loyalist ranks. At the height of the battle, Sevier and Campbell charged the high point of the Loyalist position, giving the Overmountain men a foothold atop the mountain. Ferguson was killed while trying to break through Sevier&#x27;s line, and the Loyalists surrendered shortly afterward. Sevier&#x27;s brother, Captain Robert Sevier, was mortally wounded in the battle.

==Cherokee and Chickamauga wars==
Upon returning from Kings Mountain, Sevier was told by Nancy Ward of an impending Cherokee attack. He organized a 300-man force and marched south. On December 16, 1780, he routed a Cherokee force at the Battle of Boyd&#x27;s Creek, near modern Sevierville. A few days later, he was joined by a contingent of Virginia militia led by Arthur Campbell, and the combined forces continued south, occupying the Cherokee town of Chota on December 25. They captured and burned Cherokee towns of Chilhowee and Tallassee three days later. Sevier and Campbell proceeded as far as the Hiwassee River, where they burned the villages of Great Hiwassee and Chestoee, before beginning the march home on New Year&#x27;s Day.

In February 1781, Sevier was commissioned as colonel-commandant of the Washington County militia, following the death of John Carter. Shortly afterward, he embarked on an expedition against the Cherokee Middle Towns, which lay on the other side of the mountains in the vicinity of modern Bryson City, North Carolina. Emerging from the mountains in March, his 150-man force took the village of Tuckasegee by surprise, killing about 50 and capturing several other Cherokee. Facing little opposition, he proceeded to destroy about 15 villages before returning home.

In September 1782, Sevier set out on an expedition against Dragging Canoe and his band of Cherokee, who had become concentrated in a string of villages in northern Georgia and Alabama. Because Dragging Canoe&#x27;s band had earlier been settled near the Chickamauga River, settlers called them the &quot;Chickamauga&quot; Cherokee, but they were never a separate tribe. Sevier defeated a small force near Lookout Mountain, and destroyed several Cherokee villages along the Coosa River. Chief Oconostota helped negotiate peace between the newly founded America and the Cherokee people, bringing an end to the battles between the two nations.

==State of Franklin==

In June 1784, North Carolina, bowing to pressure, from the Continental Congress and eager to be rid of an expensive and unprofitable district, ceded its lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to the federal government. However, Congress did not immediately accept the lands, creating a vacuum of power in what is now Tennessee. In August 1784, Sevier served as president of a convention held at Jonesborough with the aim of establishing a new state. In March of the following year, he was elected governor of the proposed state, which was named &quot;Franklin&quot; in honor of Benjamin Franklin.

In October 1784, North Carolina rescinded the cession and reasserted its claim to the Tennessee region. Sevier initially supported this, in part because he was offered a promotion to brigadier general, but he was persuaded by William Cocke to remain with the Franklinites. Though Sevier had popular support, a number of men from Washington County, led by John Tipton, remained loyal to North Carolina. As a result, two parallel governments were operating in Tennessee. Both elected public officials. Relations between the two governments were initially cordial, though a rivalry developed between Sevier and Tipton.

As North Carolina and Franklin competed for the loyalties of the residents of the area, Sevier became involved in intrigues with Georgia to gain control of Cherokee lands in what is now northern Alabama. He had taken out claims on several thousand acres of land. He also considered an alliance with Spain, whose Governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró tried to sway Sevier, but the American eventually abandoned that idea.

In June 1785, Sevier negotiated the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, in which the Cherokee gave up claims to lands south of the French Broad River as far as the Little River–Little Tennessee River divide. The following year, he negotiated the Treaty of Coyatee, which extended the boundary to the Little Tennessee River. The State of Franklin created three new counties (modern Cocke, Sevier, and Blount counties). The United States Senate never ratified these treaties, however, as required to make them legal between a tribe and the government. The fate of the European-American settlers who moved into these areas remained in limbo for years.

In February 1788, the rivalry between Sevier and Tipton came to a head, in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Franklin.&quot; While Sevier was campaigning against the Cherokee, Tipton ordered some of Sevier&#x27;s slaves to be seized for taxes supposedly owed to North Carolina. In response, Sevier led 150 militia to Tipton&#x27;s farm, which was defended by about 45 loyalists supporting North Carolina. Both sides demanded the other surrender, and briefly exchanged gunfire. On February 29, two days after the siege began, loyalist reinforcements from Sullivan County arrived on the scene and scattered the Franklinites. Sevier retreated, though not before two men were killed. Two of Sevier&#x27;s sons and other Franklin supporters were captured, but all were subsequently released.

In the summer of 1788, several Kirke family settlers were killed by renegade Cherokee warriors, in Blount County, in what became known by European Americans as the &quot;Nine Mile Creek Massacre&quot;. In response, Sevier invaded and destroyed several Cherokee towns in the Little Tennessee Valley. Several Cherokee leaders met with Sevier under a flag of truce to discuss peace. But John Kirke, a member of the murdered family, attacked the delegation and killed several chiefs, including Old Tassel and Old Abraham of Chilhowee. The Cherokee were enraged, resulting in new supporters for Dragging Canoe in his resistance to the European Americans.

Following the Battle of Franklin, support for Sevier and the State of Franklin collapsed among settlers in areas north of the French Broad River. North Carolina Governor Samuel Johnston issued a warrant for his arrest in July 1788. In October, after Sevier attacked David Deaderick, a Jonesborough store owner, for refusing to sell him liquor, Tipton and his men captured the leader. He was sent to Morganton, North Carolina, to stand trial for treason. He was released by Burke County Sheriff William Morrison (a Kings Mountain veteran), before the trial began.

In January 1789, Sevier defeated a large Cherokee invasion led by John Watts at the Battle of Flint Creek near Jonesborough.

==Southwest Territory==
In February 1789, Sevier took the oath of allegiance to North Carolina. He was pardoned by North Carolina Governor Alexander Martin and elected to the North Carolina State Senate. When the senate convened the Fayetteville Convention in November 1789, Sevier was a delegate from Greene County and worked to gain the North Carolina&#x27;s ratification of the U.S. Constitution. After it was ratified on November 23, Sevier helped engineer a second cession act, which passed with little opposition in December. This transferred the territory from North Carolina, of what is now the state of Tennessee, to the federal government.

To administer the new cession, Congress created the Southwest Territory in the spring of 1790; it was administered under the Northwest Ordinance. Sevier was appointed brigadier general of the territorial militia. William Blount, a fellow land speculator and North Carolina politician, was appointed governor of the territory. In June 1791, Blount negotiated the Treaty of Holston, which resolved the land disputes with the Cherokee created by the Treaty of Dumplin Creek.

Just before the cession, the territory was designated as North Carolina&#x27;s 5th congressional district. Sevier was elected to represent it in the first Congress. By the time he arrived in New York City, where the new government was temporarily situated, the cession of Tennessee had taken place. Sevier was permitted to serve out his term although he no longer represented an existing North Carolina district.

In the fall of 1793, following a Cherokee attack on Cavett&#x27;s Station west of Knoxville, Sevier led the territorial militia south into Georgia to their base territory. He defeated a Cherokee force at the Battle of Hightower and destroyed several villages. The following year, President George Washington appointed Sevier to the Southwest Territory council, a body that operated similar to that of a state senate. That same year, he was appointed to the first board of trustees of Blount College, the forerunner of the University of Tennessee.

==Governor of Tennessee==
In 1796, the Southwest Territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Tennessee. Sevier missed the state&#x27;s constitutional convention while serving on the territorial council in Washington, but he was elected the new state&#x27;s first governor. Sevier made the acquisition of Indian lands a priority. He consistently urged Congress and the Secretary of War (then responsible for relations with Native American tribes) to negotiate new treaties to that end, to extinguish Indian land claims and promote European-American settlement.

During his first term as governor, Sevier developed a rivalry with rising politician Andrew Jackson. In 1796, Jackson campaigned for the position of major-general of the state militia but Sevier threw his support behind George Conway. Jackson learned that Sevier had referred to him as a &quot;poor pitiful lawyer&quot; in private correspondence. In 1797, Jackson, then serving as a U.S. Senator, learned that fraud had taken place in the 1780s at what was then North Carolina&#x27;s Nashville land office. He notified the governor of North Carolina. When the governor demanded the office&#x27;s documents, Sevier blocked their transfer. Jackson concluded that Sevier was somehow involved in the scandal.

Sevier was a Freemason, and, while in office as governor, he helped establish the first Masonic lodge in East Tennessee. Tennessee Lodge #2 in Knoxville received its charter from the Grand Lodge of North Carolina on November 30, 1800, and John Sevier was its first Worshipful Master. Tennessee Lodge was the second Masonic lodge within the state of Tennessee, the first being St. Tammany Lodge #1, chartered in Nashville in 1796.

After Sevier&#x27;s third (two-year) term as governor, term limits prevented him from seeking a fourth consecutive term. Archibald Roane was elected as his replacement. Both Sevier and Jackson campaigned for major-general of the militia: the vote ended in a tie, and Roane chose Jackson. When Sevier announced his candidacy for governor in 1803, Roane and Jackson publicized documents acquired from the Nashville land office scandal and accused Sevier of bribery. Their efforts to smear Sevier were unsuccessful, however, and the popular Sevier easily defeated Roane in the election.

Following his inauguration, Sevier encountered Jackson in Knoxville. They had an argument during which Sevier accused Jackson of adultery in his marriage to Rachel Donelson. An enraged Jackson challenged Sevier to a duel, which he accepted. The duel was to take place at Southwest Point, but Sevier&#x27;s wagon stalled at Campbell&#x27;s Station en route to the duel. As Jackson returned to Knoxville, he encounted Sevier&#x27;s entourage. The two men loudly exchanged insults, and Sevier&#x27;s horse ran away, carrying his pistols. Jackson pointed his pistol at Sevier, who hid behind a tree. Sevier&#x27;s son pointed his pistol at Jackson, and Jackson&#x27;s second pointed his pistol at Sevier&#x27;s son. Members of both parties managed to resolve the incident before bloodshed took place.

In 1804, Sevier helped William C. C. Claiborne get appointed governor of the newly acquired Louisiana Territory, a position which Jackson had sought. Jackson supported Roane in the state&#x27;s gubernatorial election in 1805, but Sevier won with nearly two-thirds of the vote. Sevier&#x27;s last campaign for governor was in 1807, when he defeated William Cocke.

==Later life==

Barred by term limits from a fourth consecutive term as governor, Sevier sought support in 1809 from the state legislature for one of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats, but the legislature chose Joseph Anderson. (Popular election of senators did not happen until after a constitutional amendment in the early 20th century.) Sevier ran for the Knox County seat in the Tennessee State Senate, winning easily. In 1811, Sevier was elected to the U.S. Congress for the state&#x27;s . Sevier was a strong supporter of the War of 1812. President James Madison offered him a command in the army, but Sevier turned it down.

According to the early Tennessee historian Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey, Sevier attended the Lebanon In The Fork Presbyterian Church east of Knoxville with members of his family, but he was not a formal member of the church. He never served as an elder. &quot;His last wife was a member,&quot; wrote Ramsey, &quot;but he was Gullis-like and cared for none of these things.&quot;

In 1815, Sevier died in the Alabama Territory while conducting a survey of lands which Jackson had recently acquired from the Creek tribe (Muscogee) through the Treaty of Fort Jackson. He was buried along the Tallapoosa River near Fort Decatur.

In 1889, at the request of Governor Robert Love Taylor, Sevier&#x27;s remains were re-interred in the Knox County Courthouse lawn in Knoxville. A monument was placed on the grave in 1893, in a ceremony that included a speech by historian Oliver Perry Temple. In 1922, the remains of his second wife, Catherine Sherill, were re-interred next to Sevier&#x27;s. A monument recognizing his first wife, Sarah Hawkins, was placed at the site in 1946.

==Legacy==
In his book, &quot;The Lost State of Franklin&quot;, Kevin Barksdale says that Sevier was driven, at least in part, by a desire to acquire his own land claims in the trans-Appalachian region. For many East Tennesseans, he represented &quot;rugged individualism, regional exceptionalism, and civic dignity.&quot; For nearly a century after his death, historians such as Ramsey and Oliver Perry Temple heaped unconditional praise upon Sevier and romanticized various events in his life. Later authors, such as Theodore Roosevelt (&quot;Winning of the West&quot;) and Samuel Cole Williams (&quot;History of the Lost State of Franklin&quot;), added a more objective perspective to accounts of this period.

Several historians argue that the rivalry between John Sevier and Andrew Jackson was the root of the factionalism that divided East Tennessee and the rest of the state in subsequent decades. But the sections were also divided by their geography, land characteristics, and settlement patterns. East Tennessee was dominated by yeoman farmers who generally owned few slaves. Middle Tennessee had numerous planters and slaveowners, who cultivated commodity crops such as tobacco and hemp based on the labor of enslaved African Americans. West Tennessee, along the lowlands of the Mississippi River, became dominated by large cotton plantations and planters who held numerous slaves. East Tennessee voters gradually developed support for the Whig Party in the 1830s, and most were Unionists during the Civil War. Following the war, majority-white East Tennessee remained one of the South&#x27;s few predominantly white Republican regions into the early 20th century.

===Monuments and memorials===
In the 1770s, Sevier established a plantation, Mount Pleasant, along the Nolichucky River south of Jonesborough. This site inspired his nickname, &quot;Nolichucky Jack.&quot; He moved to Knoxville in 1797, where he began construction of what later became the James Park House.

He completed only the foundation, however, before relocating to Marble Springs, a plantation he owned in South Knoxville. A log cabin still standing at this site has been attributed to Sevier. But a dendrochronological analysis of the cabin&#x27;s logs, conducted by the University of Tennessee, suggests the cabin was built well after his death. Marble Springs has been designated as a state historic site associated with Sevier and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Numerous municipal and civic entities are named in honor of Sevier. These include Sevier County, Tennessee, and its county seat, Sevierville; Governor John Sevier Highway in South Knoxville; John Sevier Middle School in Kingsport; and John Sevier Elementary School in Maryville. Other entities named for him include a coal-fired power plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority near Rogersville, a railroad classification yard operated by Norfolk Southern in east Knox County, and a dormitory at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville.

The Knoxville-based Bonny Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution is named for Sevier&#x27;s wife, Catherine Sherrill. The later Bonny Kate Elementary in South Knoxville was also named for her. The John Sevier-Sarah Hawkins chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Johnson City is also named in honor of Sevier and his first wife.

In 1931, a statue of Sevier, created by Leopold and Belle Kinney Scholz, was dedicated at the National Statuary Hall Collection of the U. S. Capitol. Other monuments include a bust on the first floor of the Tennessee State Capitol, and Daughters of American Revolution monuments at Marble Springs in Knoxville and at Myrtle Hill Cemetery in Rome, Georgia. A monument to Sevier&#x27;s father, Valentine Sevier (&quot;the immigrant ancestor,&quot; as distinguished from John&#x27;s brother, also named Valentine), has been placed at Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park in Elizabethton.

Tennessee&#x27;s first office building built specifically for state government offices is the John Sevier State Office Building. The six-story building opened in 1940 adjacent to the State Capital Building in downtown Nashville.

==Family==
 A marker exists on the current grave of John Sevier on the lawn of the Old Knox County Courthouse. This marker claims his birth date was September 23, 1744, in contradiction to most sources that claim his birth year of 1745.

No evidence exists for the descent of Sevier from the royal family of St. Francis Xavier of Navarre. The name &quot;Sevier&quot; is an anglicized form of &quot;Xavier&quot; and suggests the family originated in the village of Javier, Spain. In the 17th century, some members of the Xavier family became Protestants (Huguenots). In 1685, following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Sevier&#x27;s grandfather, Don Juan Xavier, moved to London to escape religious persecution. He changed his name to the anglicized John Sevier. Sevier&#x27;s father, Valentine &quot;The Immigrant&quot; Sevier, was born in London and immigrated to the colonies in 1740.

John Sevier married Sarah Hawkins (1746–1780) in 1761. They had ten children: Joseph, James, John, Elizabeth, Sarah, Mary Ann, Valentine (namesake of the paternal grandfather), Rebecca, Richard, and Nancy. Following Sarah&#x27;s death, Sevier married Catherine Sherrill (1754–1836). They had eight children together: Catherine, Ruthe, George Washington, Samuel, Polly, Eliza, Joanna, and Robert.

Sevier&#x27;s descendants followed other migrants south and west. His grandnephew, Ambrose Hundley Sevier, served as one of the first U.S. senators from Arkansas. Sevier County, Arkansas, is named for him. The Conway family, which dominated early Arkansas state politics, were cousins of the Seviers. Henry Conway was a friend of John Sevier, and served as Treasurer of the State of Franklin. Two of Sevier&#x27;s sons, James and John, married Conway&#x27;s daughters, Nancy and Elizabeth, respectively. Henry Conway was the grandfather of Ambrose Sevier and James Sevier Conway, who was Arkansas&#x27;s first governor.

By the mid-19th century, another branch of the Sevier descendants had settled in Madison Parish, Louisiana, in the northeast part of the state. George Washington Sevier, Sr. (1858–1925), born to a planter family, was elected as a member of the Madison Parish Police Jury. He served as the parish tax assessor from 1891 to 1916. Other members served in local offices of Tallulah, the parish seat, as well as the parish, and state legislature, through 1974. William Putnam &quot;Buck&quot; Sevier, Jr.,a banker, had a 44-year career in elected office, capped by serving as mayor of Tallulah from 1946 to 1974.

<doc id="534478" wikidata="Q2602337" url="?curid=534478" title="Op-ed">
<text>An op-ed, short for &quot;opposite the editorial page,&quot; is a type of written prose commonly found in newspapers, magazines, and online publications. They usually represent a writer&#x27;s strong and focused opinion on an issue of relevance to a targeted audience. Typically ranging from 500 to 700 words, op-eds are distinct from articles written by the publication&#x27;s editorial board and often feature the opinions of outside contributors. Op-eds allow authors, not part of the publication&#x27;s editorial team, to express opinions, perspectives, and arguments on various issues of public interest. Unlike traditional editorials, which reflect the opinion of the publication itself, op-eds offer independent voices a foundation to influence public discourse. &quot;The New York Times&quot; is widely credited with popularizing the modern op-ed format.

== Origin ==

The &quot;Page Op.&quot;, created in 1921 by Herbert Bayard Swope of &quot;The New York Evening World,&quot; is a possible precursor to the modern op-ed. When Swope took over as main editor in 1920, he opted to designate a page from editorial staff as &quot;a catchall for book reviews, society boilerplate, and obituaries&quot;. Swope explained:

The modern op-ed page was formally developed in 1970 under the direction of The New York Times editor John B. Oakes. Media scholar Michael J. Socolow writes of Oakes&#x27; innovation:  &quot;The Times&#x27; effort synthesized various antecedents and editorial visions. Journalistic innovation is usually complex and typically involves multiple external factors. The Times op-ed page appeared in an era of democratizing cultural and political discourse and economic distress for the company itself.&quot;The newspaper&#x27;s executives developed a place for outside contributors, with space reserved for sale at a premium rate for additional commentaries and other purposes.

The Washington Post too published its own version of the op-ed right before the New York Times debuted in September 1970. Significant differences between The Post&#x27;s op-ed page and The Times’s op-ed page include The Washington Post having no ads and no artistic component. In the 1930s, The Washington Post began referring to its commentary section as the &quot;op-ed page,&quot; situated opposite its editorial page.  The Los Angeles Times followed suit with a similar designation in the 1950s and 1960s, while The Chicago Tribune had tried a variation of this format as early as 1912. That is to say that while we credit Oakes as the creator of the op-ed, the true origins of the op-ed are highly debated in the journalistic sphere.

== Culture ==
With the development and availability of radio and television broadcasting as major information outlets, stakeholders and print journalism workers sought to increase or maintain their audience and relevance. Major newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post began including more opinionated journalism, adding more columns, and increasing the extent of their opinion pages to drive public participation and readership.

This was exacerbated by the period, as world events like WWI, WWII, the Vietnam War, the Korean War, and major cultural changes began to make the public restless. Editors wanted to keep up readership as newspapers began to go belly up; they also needed to find new ways to compete with the versatility of TV and radio, which started to become commonplace in people’s homes. On the other hand, the general public wanted to have multiple points of view, as this time was also marked by a wave of liberalism, including the fight for gender equality and the civil rights movement.

== Structure and features ==
Op-eds feature a concise structure, with an average of under 700 words, and typically begin with an introduction. They begin with a hook to engage readers, usually something outlandish or exaggerated for the shock factor. Then the author usually ties the intro together with a story related to them or an experience they had. Following this is the body, which has a tone that is usually persuasive and conversational, often divided into three or four sections, each presenting evidence or arguments supporting the thesis. They then tie the op-ed together with a conclusion or closing statement where a call to action is made.

Op-eds are written by a wide range of authors, including journalists, academics, politicians, and activists. Publications invite guest contributors to present various viewpoints, despite the viewpoints often being contradictory to the editorial&#x27;s position on certain topics. Today, op-eds are widely read across both traditional and digital platforms, and writers range from academics and activists to politicians and celebrities.

The op-ed is known for the diverse opinions of its columnists and can include media in a variety of forms including:
*Seminar
*Essays
*Poetry
*Political cartoon
*Advertisements
*Speeches
*Blog post

== Rhetoric ==
Op-eds are written to persuade, inform, or incite public debate, with rhetoric playing a vital role in achieving these goals. Contributors invited to write an op-ed for an editorial commonly use appeals to ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic) to structure their arguments and connect with readers.
#Ethos: Contributors often establish their credentials early to build credibility. For instance, a climate scientist’s op-ed on climate change would typically begin with a brief mention of the author&#x27;s background to emphasize their authority on the subject.
#Pathos: An emotional appeal is also a common tactic, with authors evoking sympathy, anger, or hope in order to drive people to action.
#Logos: Logical appeals are also achieved through well-reasoned arguments and evidence. Authors often use statistics, historical examples, and real-world scenarios to make their case compelling and hard to ignore.

== In different media ==
With the rise of digital platforms, op-eds have expanded beyond traditional print media. Online publications and blogs have become popular, and social media plays a significant role in disseminating and engaging with op-ed content. Additionally, op-eds are increasingly presented in audio and video formats, reaching audiences through podcasts and video essays. The internet and social media have further evolved the op-ed format. Platforms like HuffPost, Medium, and Substack allow virtually anyone to publish opinion pieces, which have been conflated with the op-ed to the point where the terms have become interchangeable. While they have always had a significant impact on public opinion, the digital age has allowed op-eds to influence the public more broadly and almost instantaneously.

== Evolution of terminology ==

In April 2021, &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion editor Kathleen Kingsbury announced the retirement of the term &quot;op-ed&quot; in favor of the more precise term &quot;guest essay&quot;. The main reason was that in the modern digital world in which millions of readers only read the &quot;Times&quot; online, it no longer made sense to speak of an article running &quot;opposite the editorial page&quot;. In Kingsbury&#x27;s words: &quot;It is a relic of an older age and an older print newspaper design&quot;.

== Popular op-eds ==
*&quot;I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration&quot; (2018) - The New York Times: Written by an anonymous senior official in the first Trump administration, this op-ed created a significant public response by claiming that some within the administration were actively working to subvert certain presidential directives.
*&quot;Can America Prevent Russia from Using Low-Yield Nukes&quot; (2018) - The Buzz: Written by author Mark B. Schneider, a senior analyst with the National Institute for PublicPolicy. This op-ed advises the U.S. to deploy low-yield nuclear warheads on submarines to counter Russia&#x27;s strategy of using limited nuclear strikes for coercive advantage in conventional conflicts.
*&quot;How Will the Mideast Bloodshed End? Not With a Bullet&quot; (2024) - The Los Angeles Times: Written by LZ Granderson this article discusses the limitations of military solutions in the Middle East, emphasizing the need for humanitarian aid and diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of conflict and instability in Gaza and Lebanon.

== Possible conflicts of interest ==

The relationship between op-eds, editors, and funding from interest groups has been a concern. In 2011, in an open letter to  The New York Times, a group of U.S. journalists and academics called for conflict-of-interest transparency in op-eds. Critics of op-ed journalism argue that it can oversimplify complex issues and may introduce bias, especially when written by people affiliated with powerful interest groups, corporations, or political entities.  They argue that op-eds can become tools for misinformation, especially in today’s highly polarized media environment, due to the lack of rigorous editorial oversight.

<text>Brodmann area 20, or BA20, is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. The region encompasses most of the ventral temporal cortex, a region believed to play a part in high-level visual processing and recognition memory.

This area is also known as inferior temporal area 20, and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the inferior temporal gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded medially by the ectorhinal area 36 (H), laterally by the middle temporal area 21, rostrally by the temporopolar area 38 (H) and caudally by the occipitotemporal area 37 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

==Guenon==
Brodmann area 20 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is cytoarchitecturally homologous to the inferior temporal area 20 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): area 20 is similar to area 19 of Brodmann-1909 in the relative abundance of small cell types relative to the number of larger pyramidal cells; a very dense, wide internal granular layer (IV) composed almost exclusively of granule cells, as in area 18 of Brodmann-1909; a broad, clear internal pyramidal layer (V) with few cells; and a distinct multiform layer (VI). The major differences from areas 18 and 19 are somewhat lesser cell density; absence of a division of the external pyramidal layer (III) into sublayers 3a and 3b; layer V is more clearly distinguished from layer VI and, on average, has a greater density of pyramidal ganglion cells than in the other areas; layer VI is wider, more diffuse and has fewer cells that are concentrated in the outer part of the layer to produce a denser sublayer 6a and a less dense sublayer 6b.

<text>The utricle and saccule are the two otolith organs in the vertebrate inner ear. The word utricle comes . The utricle and saccule are part of the balancing system (membranous labyrinth) in the vestibule of the bony labyrinth (small oval chamber). They use small stones and a viscous fluid to stimulate hair cells to detect motion and orientation. The utricle detects linear accelerations and head-tilts in the horizontal plane.

==Structure==
The utricle is larger than the saccule and is of an oblong form, compressed transversely, and occupies the upper and back part of the vestibule, lying in contact with the recessus ellipticus and the part below it.

===Macula===

The macula of utricle (macula acustica utriculi) is a small (2 by 3 mm) thickening lying horizontally on the floor of the utricle where the epithelium contains vestibular hair cells that allow a person to perceive changes in latitudinal acceleration as well as the effects of gravity; it receives the utricular filaments of the acoustic nerve.

The hair cells are mechanoreceptors which have 40 to 70 stereocilia and only one true cilium called a kinocilium. The kinocilium is the only sensory aspect of the hair cell and is what causes hair cell polarization. The tips of these stereocilia and kinocilium are embedded in a gelatinous layer, which together with the statoconia form the otolithic membrane. This membrane is weighted with calcium carbonate-protein granules called otoliths. The otolithic membrane adds weight to the tops of the hair cells and increases their inertia. The addition in weight and inertia is vital to the utricle&#x27;s ability to detect linear acceleration, as described below, and to determine the orientation of the head. When the head is tilted such that gravity pulls on the statoconia, the gelatinous layer is pulled in the same direction also, causing the sensory hairs to bend. Labyrinthine activity responsible for the nystagmus induced by off-vertical axis rotation arises in the otolith organs and couples to the oculomotor system through the velocity storage mechanism.

===Microanatomy===
The cavity of the utricle communicates behind with the semicircular ducts by five orifices.

The ductus utriculosaccularis comes off of the anterior wall of the utricle and opens into the ductus endolymphaticus.

==Function==

The utricle contains mechanoreceptors called hair cells that distinguish between degrees of tilting of the head, thanks to their apical stereocilia set-up. These are covered by otoliths which, due to gravity, pull on the stereocilia and tilt them. Depending on whether the tilt is in the direction of the kinocilium or not, the resulting hair cell polarisation is excitatory (depolarising) or inhibitory (hyperpolarisation), respectively. Any orientation of the head causes a combination of stimulation to the utricles and saccules of the two ears. The brain interprets head orientation by comparing these inputs to each other and to other input from the eyes and stretch receptors in the neck, thereby detecting whether only the head is tilted or the entire body is tipping. The inertia of the otolithic membranes is especially important in detecting linear acceleration. Suppose you are sitting in a car at a stoplight and then begin to move. The otolithic membrane of the macula utriculi briefly lags behind the rest of the tissues, bends the stereocilia backward, and stimulates the cells. When you stop at the next light, the macula stops but the otolithic membrane keeps going for a moment, bending the stereocilia forward. The hair cells convert this pattern of stimulation to nerve signals, and the brain is thus advised of changes in your linear velocity. This signal to the vestibular nerve (which takes it to the brainstem) does not adapt with time. The effect of this is that, for example, an individual lying down to sleep will continue to detect that they are lying down hours later when they awaken.

Unbent and at rest hairs in the macula have a base rate of depolarization of 90-100 action potentials a second. The brain suppresses this, and we ignore it and know that our body is stabilized. If the head moves or the body accelerates or decelerates, then bending occurs. Depending on the direction of bending, the hair cells will either be excited or inhibited resulting in either an increase or decrease in firing frequency of the hair cells.

The macula is also sensitive to linear acceleration as the inertia possessed by the statoconia can also shift the gelatinous layer during increases and decreases in linear velocity.

<doc id="534489" wikidata="Q1078789" url="?curid=534489" title="Innocent Eyes (2003 Delta Goodrem album)">
<text>Innocent Eyes is the debut studio album by Australian singer Delta Goodrem, released in Australia on 24 March 2003. It was later released in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2003. Goodrem co-wrote most of the material, excluding &quot;Throw It Away&quot;, &quot;Lost Without You&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot;. The album features two self-penned songs, &quot;In My Own Time&quot; and &quot;Will You Fall for Me&quot;. Goodrem worked with writers and producers such as: Audius Mtawarira, Bridget Benenate, Cathy Dennis, Eliot Kennedy, Gary Barlow, Jarrad Rogers, Kara DioGuardi, Vince Pizzinga and others to create the album with a collection of piano-based pop and ballad tracks.

Five singles were released from the album. Its lead single &quot;Born to Try&quot; was released in November 2002 and became a massive commercial success, peaking atop the ARIA Singles Chart and the New Zealand Singles Chart, becoming Goodrem&#x27;s most successful single to date. Follow-up singles &quot;Lost Without You&quot;, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, &quot;Not Me, Not I&quot; and &quot;Predictable&quot; also all reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart. Goodrem became the first artist to have five number-one singles from a debut album. The first three singles charted within the top 10 in the United Kingdom. To promote the album, Goodrem embarked on The Visualise Tour.

&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; debuted at number one on the Australian Albums Chart, making it her first number-one album. Altogether it sold 4.5 million copies worldwide including 1.2 million in Australia alone.
&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; is the most successful album in Australia in 19 years. It was the highest-selling album in Australia of the decade and is the second-best-selling Australian album of all time.

She celebrated the 10 year anniversary with a special acoustic edition in 2013 called &quot;Innocent Eyes: Ten Year Anniversary Acoustic Edition&quot; and gave it its own tour in 2023 to celebrate its 20th anniversary.

==Background==
In September 2000, Goodrem signed to Sony Music and an album which she planned to release with independent label Empire Records was shelved. A year later, Goodrem released her debut single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; which peaked at number 64 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

Soon after, Goodrem began working on &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;. She worked with a range of producers and songwriters, including the True North production and songwriting team: Gary Barlow, Eliot Kennedy (Spice Girls), Ric Wake (Celine Dion, Taylor Dayne, Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey), Kara DioGuardi (Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera, Avril Lavigne, Hilary Duff), Matthew Gerrard (Mandy Moore, BBMak), Vince Pizzinga (Midnight Oil, Danielle Spencer), David Nicholas (INXS, Elton John, George) and Mark Holden.
&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; is a Pop, pop rock and adult contemporary album which uses mostly live instruments.
Talking about the album, Goodrem said: &quot;I wanted to make an album that reflected me at this time in my life&quot;, &quot;Every song takes me to a place where I can remember what happened.&quot; She also said: &quot;The album is almost like a diary I have been keeping over the last two years&quot;, &quot;Every track has a meaning behind it that&#x27;s personal to me. I have been looking forward to this day for a long time and I just hope that everyone likes the music as much as I loved making it.&quot;

==Lawsuit==
In 2004, Goodrem had been accused of owing thousands of dollars to songwriter Mark Holden. Holden wanted to clear up the terms of his contract with Goodrem and her record label Sony and requested all consultancy fees owed to him under the agreement.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Matthew Chisling from AllMusic described Goodrem&#x27;s presence in the music industry as a &quot;refreshing change&quot;. He also said that, &quot;&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; reflects a mature yet clean display of true vocal talent&quot;. Caroline Sullivan a writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;Goodrem sings her aspirational ballads with heartfelt candour, while her co-writer&#x27;s credit on nearly every song seems to be more than affectation. The lyrics are a bit la-la-floating-on-clouds, but that doesn&#x27;t dilute their charm&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

===Singles===
&quot;Born to Try&quot; was the first song from the album released in Australia on 11 November 2002, just a few days after Goodrem&#x27;s eighteenth birthday. At the time of its release, Goodrem was performing the song on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, as singer Nina Tucker. The song debuted on the Australian Singles Chart on 18 November 2002 at number three. On its second week the song jumped to number two and was accredited platinum by ARIA, by its third week the song had knocked &quot;The Ketchup Song&quot; by Las Ketchup off the top spot and became Goodrem&#x27;s first number-one single. The song eventually went on to certify triple platinum, becoming the fourth highest-selling single in Australia for 2003. It won three ARIA Awards for Breakthrough Artist – Single, Highest Selling Single and Single of the Year. &quot;Born to Try&quot; also went number-one in New Zealand and Slovenia, top ten in the UK, and top twenty in Ireland and the Netherlands.

&quot;Lost Without You&quot; was the second song released from the album. Released to radio on 14 February 2003, it became the most added song to radio for that week. It was released as a CD single on 3 March 2003 in Australia. The song gave Goodrem her second number one single in Australia on 10 March 2003 debuting at number one. The song eventually went on to certify double platinum, becoming the seventh highest selling single in Australia for 2003. It was nominated for one ARIA Award for Highest Selling Single but lost to herself with &quot;Born to Try&quot;. &quot;Lost Without You&quot; also went top ten in New Zealand, Spain and the UK, and became the first of her four Number One singles in Sweden.

On 17 April 2003 it was announced that the third song released from the album was &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; which was released as a CD single on 9 June 2003. The song debuted on Australian Singles Chart the charts at number two on 16 June 2003, behind &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; by Evanescence, and was accredited gold. After three weeks in the charts it moved one spot up the charts and became Goodrem&#x27;s third number-one hit single in Australia. The song went to certify platinum by ARIA, becoming the eighteenth highest selling single in Australia for 2003. It was nominated for one ARIA Award for Highest Selling Single but again lost to herself with Born to Try. &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; also went top ten in the UK, top twenty in New Zealand and topped the chart in Israel.

&quot;Not Me, Not I&quot; was the fourth song released from the album in Australia on 15 September 2003. The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Michael Spiccia and was filmed in August 2003. Goodrem was determined to film the music video and to have it completed before she started her second round of chemotherapy for Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma because she said the song is her favourite from the album. The song made its debut on the Australian Singles Chart at number two behind Dido&#x27;s &quot;White Flag&quot;. Ond on its second week it went to number-one, making it Goodrem&#x27;s fourth number-one single, breaking Kylie Minogue&#x27;s record of having the most songs released from an album to reach number-one. The single also made history when it topped the chart in Malta, making Goodrem the first Australian artist to have a Number One record (either album or single) in that country.

&quot;Predictable&quot; was the fifth song released from the album and was released as a double A-side with her version of the John Lennon Christmas song &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;. It saw the release to radio on 25 November 2003 and topped the airplay charts, and when it saw its physical release, it became her fifth number-one single.

===Tours===
====The Visualise Tour====

During the initial release and promotion of &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, Goodrem was unable to tour due to her cancer diagnosis in July 2003. Following a period of recovery and the release of her second studio album &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; (2004), she began preparing her debut tour which would showcase both albums. During July 2005, Goodrem embarked on The Visualise Tour, performing a total of ten shows to an audience of 80,000 people. The set list incorporated ten songs from &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;.

====Innocent Eyes 20th Anniversary Tour====

In September 2023, to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, Goodrem embarked on a retrospective tour in theatres across Australia. She performed the album in its entirety and original sequence, in addition to a medley of songs which followed &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, and her 2023 single &quot;Back to Your Heart&quot;. The tour was a sell out, with additional shows added.

=====Tour dates=====
==Commercial performance==
&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; debuted at number one on the Australian ARIA Albums Charts on 31 March 2003 with sales of over 70,000 copies, accrediting platinum and knocking Norah Jones&#x27;s album &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; from the top spot. The album went on to spend twenty-nine weeks at number one. This broke John Farnham&#x27;s record of twenty-five weeks at number one with &quot;Whispering Jack&quot; (1986). &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; was then tied with Neil Diamond&#x27;s album &quot;Hot August Night&quot; (1972) for spending the most weeks at number one in Australian history. Its accreditation reached to fourteen times platinum. The album became the highest-selling album in Australia for 2003, spent eighty-seven weeks in the top one hundred, and won six ARIA Awards for Highest Selling Album, Best Female Artist, Breakthrough Artist – Album, Best Pop Release and Channel V&#x27;s Oz Artist of the Year. In 2004 the album again won the award for Highest Selling Album. It went to sell over a million copies in Australia. In the UK, the album debuted on the charts at number two behind Beyoncé Knowles&#x27;s album &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (2003). It spent thirty-one weeks in the top seventy-five, and became the eighteenth highest-selling album for 2003. &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; is the second highest- selling album by an Australian female singer in the 2000s, behind Kylie Minogue&#x27;s album &quot;Fever&quot; which sold over six million copies worldwide.

On 23 December 2003 it was announced that the one millionth copy of the album had been released to retail, the disc was specially marked by Sony and the buyer would receive a plaque commemorating the milestone. On 7 January 2010, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; was announced as Australia&#x27;s top-selling album for the 2000s, for which Goodrem received a special award at the 2010 ARIA No. 1 Awards in Sydney on 22 July 2010.

<doc id="534490" wikidata="Q3494094" url="?curid=534490" title="Saccule">
<text>The saccule (Latin: sacculus) is a bed of sensory cells in the inner ear that detects linear acceleration and head tilting in the vertical plane, and converts these vibrations into electrical impulses to be interpreted by the brain. When the head moves vertically, the sensory cells of the saccule are moved due to a combination of inertia and gravity. In response, the neurons connected to the saccule transmit electrical impulses that represent this movement to the brain. These impulses travel along the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem.

The vestibular system is important for balance, or equilibrium. It includes the saccule, utricle, and the three semicircular canals. The vestibule is the name of the fluid-filled, membranous duct that contains these organs of balance and is in turn encased in the temporal bone of the skull as a part of the inner ear.

==Structure==

The saccule, or sacculus, is the smaller of the two vestibular sacs. It is globular in form and lies in the recessus sphæricus near the opening of the vestibular duct of the cochlea. Its cavity does not directly communicate with that of the utricle. The anterior part of the saccule exhibits an oval thickening, the macula acustica sacculi, or macula, to which are distributed the saccular filaments of the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve, also known as the statoacoustic nerve or cranial nerve VIII.

Within the macula are hair cells, each having a hair bundle on the apical aspect. The hair bundle is composed of a single kinocilium and many (at least 70) stereocilia. Stereocilia are connected to mechanically gated ion channels in the hair cell plasma membrane via tip links. Supporting cells interdigitate between hair cells and secrete the otolithic membrane, a thick, gelatinous layer of glycoprotein. Covering the surface of the otolithic membrane are otoliths, which are crystals of calcium carbonate. For this reason, the saccule is sometimes called an &quot;otolithic organ.&quot;

From the posterior wall of the saccule is given off a canal, the ductus endolymphaticus (endolymphatic duct). This duct is joined by the ductus utriculosaccularis, and then passes along the aquæductus vestibuli and ends in a blind pouch saccus endolymphaticus (endolymphatic sac) on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where it is in contact with the dura mater.

From the lower part of the saccule a short tube, the canalis reuniens of Hensen, passes downward and opens into the ductus cochlearis near its vestibular extremity.

Both the utricle and the saccule provide information about acceleration. The difference between them is that the utricle is more sensitive to horizontal acceleration, whereas the saccule is more sensitive to vertical acceleration.

==Function==
The saccule gathers sensory information to orient the body in space. It primarily gathers information about linear movement in the vertical plane, including the force due to gravity. The saccule, like the utricle, provides information to the brain about head position when it is not moving. The structures that enable the saccule to gather this vestibular information are the hair cells. The 2 by 3 mm patch of hair cells and supporting cells are called a macula. Each hair cell of a macula has 40 to 70 stereocilia and one true cilium called a kinocilium. The stereocilia are oriented by the striola, a curved ridge that runs through the middle of the macula; in the saccule they are oriented away from the striola The tips of the stereocilia and kinocilium are embedded in a gelatinous otolithic membrane. This membrane is weighted with protein-calcium carbonate granules called otoliths, which add to the weight and inertia of the membrane and enhance the sense of gravity and motion.

Not much is known of how this organ is used in other species. Research has shown, like songbirds, females in some species of fish show seasonal variation in
auditory processing and the sensitivity of the saccule of females peaks during the breeding season. This is due to an increase in the
density of saccular hair cells, partly resulting from reduced apoptosis. The increase the hair cells make also increase the sensitivity to male mating calls. An example of this is seen in &quot;Porichthys notatus&quot;, or plainfin midshipman fish.

==Clinical significance==
===Assessment===
Saccular function can be assessed by the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP). This is a middle latency (P1 between 12 and 20 ms) waveform denoting inhibition of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle ipsilateral to the stimulus. While not truly a unilateral reflex (response waveforms can be detected in the SCM contralateral to the stimulus in approximately 40% of cases), cVEMPs are more unilateral than the closely related ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). The most reliable points on the cVEMP waveform are known as P1 and N1. Of all waveform characteristics, P1-N1 amplitude is the most reliable and clinically relevant. cVEMP amplitude is linearly dependent upon stimulus intensity and is most reliably elicited with a loud (generally at or above 95 dB nHL) click or tone burst. The cVEMP can also be said to be low-frequency tuned, with largest amplitudes in response to 500–750 Hz tonebursts. This myogenic potential is felt to assess saccular function, because the response is present in completely deafened ears and because it is routed through the inferior vestibular nerve, which is known to dominantly innervate the saccule. .

==Role in evolution of the ear==

Research suggests that in vertebrate evolution, sensory cells became specialized as gravistatic sensors after they became assembled to form the ear. After this aggregation, growth, including duplication and segregation of existing neurosensory epithelia, gave rise to new epithelia and can be appreciated by comparing sensory epithelia from the inner ears of different vertebrates and their innervation by different neuronal populations. Novel directions of differentiation were apparently further expanded by incorporating unique molecular modules in newly developed sensory epithelia. For example, the saccule gave rise to the auditory epithelium and corresponding neuronal population of tetrapods, starting possibly in an aquatic environment.

<doc id="534498" wikidata="Q1759140" url="?curid=534498" title="Tales from the Darkside">
<text>Tales from the Darkside is an American horror anthology television series created by George A. Romero. A pilot episode was first broadcast on October 29, 1983. The series was picked up for syndication, and the first season premiered on September 30, 1984. The show would run for a total of four seasons.

The series spans various genres of speculative fiction, including science fiction and fantasy in addition to horror, and many episodes have darkly comic elements.

==Production==

The movie &quot;Creepshow&quot; was released in 1982. It was based on the EC horror comic books of the 1950s, such as &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;. In light of the film’s moderate success, its producer, Laurel Entertainment, decided to explore the potential for a television series based on the feature. However, Warner Bros. had the rights to some elements of &quot;Creepshow&quot;. Laurel chose to move forward with a series that omitted aspects of the movie that were owned by Warner Bros. The result was &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, which explored the same themes as &quot;Creepshow&quot;, but discarded the framing device and other elements that were based directly on the comics.

Some episodes were adapted from the works of well-known authors, or written by the authors themselves. Stories or teleplays by Frederik Pohl, Harlan Ellison, Clive Barker, Michael Bishop, Robert Bloch, John Cheever, Michael McDowell, and Fredric Brown were used over the course of the series. Two episodes, &quot;Word Processor of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Sorry, Right Number&quot;, were based on short stories by Stephen King. The latter was adapted for television by King himself.

===Opening and closing sequences===
In the vein of previous anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, each episode opens with a montage and an unseen narrator. Several scenes are shown, followed by a slow pan through a forest filled with barren trees, which in turn yields to a fence-lined path through a meadow. This last shot fades into a black-and-white negative image as the series title appears.

The closing credits are displayed against the final, negative image of the opening.

The narration is performed by Paul Sparer, and was written by Romero. The opening and closing themes are performed by Donald Rubinstein, who co-wrote the music with Erica Lindsay.

The entire opening sequence of the show was filmed outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, not far from where George Romero used to film most of his films back in the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s. Romero was familiar with the area because he had lived there for many years and scouted out numerous filming locations for well over 10 years or more when he went into producing the Tales From the Darkside TV series. The Bridge location used to be called Deihls Bridge now known as Turner&#x27;s Bridge. Some of the forest footage and the creek that was flowing over the Rocks was filmed in Clear Creek State Forest just north of Pittsburgh. Other filming locations such as the farm, the fields, and the road with the old wooden fence were filmed in or immediately around Boswell, PA and Ligonier, PA, although much of that area has changed since the filming date of 1983.

==Episodes==


==Broadcast==
In its initial run, LBS Communications distributed &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; in barter syndication. Distribution rights later passed to Worldvision Enterprises after Aaron Spelling Productions acquired Worldvision Enterprises and Laurel Productions in 1989 and are currently held by CBS Media Ventures.

==Home video==
The series was released on VHS with the episodes&#x27; original music. Later DVD releases altered or omitted some of this music.

Paramount Home Entertainment, through CBS Home Entertainment (sister company to Spelling Television, the successor to Laurel), released the series on DVD, beginning on February 10, 2009. The company rereleased the complete series on Region 1 DVD in 2018. Revelation Films released the entire series in Region 2.

An audio commentary by Executive Producer George A. Romero on the pilot episode, &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, as well as two unaired eplsodes, &quot;Akhbar&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;Attic Suite&quot;, are cited on the cover of the DVD.

==Subsequent series and movie==
&quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; executive producer Richard P. Rubinstein and his company Laurel would go on to make the horror anthology series &quot;Monsters&quot;, which premiered in 1988 and ran for three seasons, as well as &quot;Tales from the Darkside: The Movie&quot;, which was released theatrically in 1990. A sequel to the film was announced, but never made.

In November 2013, it was reported that Joe Hill, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci were developing a reboot of the series for The CW, with CBS Television Studios. In 2014, Hill said that he would serve as creative director, and guide the show. Added Hill, &quot;&quot;Darkside&quot; is a loose reboot ... It tells stories about different characters. It also tells an ongoing story. I love the original &quot;Tales From The Darkside&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, but I think in a post-&quot;X-Files&quot; world there&#x27;s really no room for a straight anthology show. There has to be more. I like stories that work like puzzle boxes, every episode is turning another facet. We have something a little like that in &quot;Darkside&quot; ... every episode is a different story but three or four episodes in, you&#x27;re going, &#x27;Wait a minute, these parts actually all go together, don&#x27;t they?&#x27;&quot;

In February 2014, The CW gave the reboot a pilot order. Shooting began on March 19 and wrapped on April 4. The CW did not pick up the series, however. It then was offered to other networks unsuccessfully.

==In other media==
The book &quot;Tales from the Darkside: Volume One&quot;, published in 1988, consisted of stories and episode novelizations.

Scripts written by Hill for the proposed reboot were adapted into a four-issue comic book series published in June 2016, followed by a collection of scripts in book form in October 2016. Both the comics and the book were released by IDW Publishing.

<text>Annemarie Schimmel SI HI TÇLN (7 April 1922 – 26 January 2003) was an influential German Orientalist and scholar who wrote extensively on Islam, especially Sufism. She was a professor at Harvard University from 1967 to 1992.

==Early life and education==

Schimmel was born to Protestant and highly cultured middle-class parents in Erfurt, Germany. Her father Paul was a postal worker and her mother Anna belonged to a family with connections to seafaring and international trade. Schimmel remembered her father as &quot;a wonderful playmate, full of fun,&quot; and she recalled that her mother made her feel that she was the child of her dreams. She also remembered her childhood home as being full of poetry and literature, though her family was not an academic one.

Having finished high school at age 15, she worked voluntarily for half a year in the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labor Service). She then began studying at the University of Berlin in 1939, at the age of 17, during the Third Reich (1933–1945), the period of Nazi domination in Europe. At the university, she was deeply influenced by her teacher Hans Heinrich Schaeder, who suggested that she study the &quot;Divan of Shams Tabrisi&quot;, one of the major works of Jalaluddin Rumi. In November 1941 she received a doctorate with the thesis &quot;Die Stellung des Kalifen und der Qadis im spätmittelalterlichen Ägypten&quot; (&quot;The Position of the Caliph and the Qadi in Late Medieval Egypt&quot;). She was then only 19 years old and her thesis was awarded magna cum laude. Not long after, she was drafted by the Auswärtiges Amt (German Foreign Office), where she worked for the next few years while continuing her scholarly studies in her free time. After the end of World War II in Europe, in May 1945, she was detained for several months by U.S. authorities for investigation of her activities as a German foreign service worker, but she was cleared of any suspicion of collaboration with the Nazis. In 1946, at the age of 23, she became a professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Marburg, Germany. She was married briefly in the 1950s, but domestic life did not suit her, and she soon returned to her scholarly studies. She earned a second doctorate at Marburg in the history of religions (&quot;Religionswissenschaft&quot;) in 1954.

==Later life and scholarly career==
===In Turkey (Ankara University, 1954–1967)===
A turning point in Schimmel&#x27;s life came in 1954 when she was appointed professor of the history of religion at Ankara University. She spent five years in the capital city of Turkey teaching in Turkish and immersing herself in the culture and mystical tradition of the country. She was the first woman and the first non-Muslim to teach theology at the university.

===Harvard University (1967–1992)===
In 1967 she inaugurated the Indo-Muslim studies program at Harvard University and remained on the faculty there for the next twenty-five years. While living in quarters on the Harvard campus, Schimmel often visited New York City, where, as a consultant at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she was famed for her ability to date manuscripts and objects from the style of calligraphy in or on them. Her memory of calligraphic styles was almost photographic.

During the 1980s, she served on the editorial board of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion&quot;, published in 16 volumes (Macmillan, 1988) under the aegis of Mircea Eliade.

In 1992, upon her retirement from Harvard, she was named Professor Emerita of Indo-Muslim Culture. During this period, she was also an honorary professor at the University of Bonn.

===Back in Germany (1992–2003)===
After leaving Harvard, she returned to Germany, where she lived in Bonn until her death in 2003.

===Religion===
She was often asked by both Muslims and non-Muslims whether she was a Muslim. In such cases, she preferred to give an evasive answer, saying, for example, that only those who are not sure whether they are good Muslims or not can really be good Muslims.

===Languages, interests and expertise===
She was multilingual—besides German, English, and Turkish, she spoke Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Punjabi—and her interests ranged across the Muslim landscape. She published more than fifty books and hundreds of articles on Islamic literature, mysticism, and culture, and she translated Persian, Urdu, Arabic, Sindhi, and Turkish poetry and literature into English and German. Her particular fondness for cats led her to write a book about their role in Islamic literature, and her interest in mysticism resulted in a book about numerical symbolism in various cultures. Her consuming passion, however, was Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. Even prominent Sufis acknowledged her as one of the foremost experts on their history and tradition.

Schimmel was the cofounder of &quot;Fikrun wa Fann&quot;, a multilingual cultural magazine.

==Awards and honors==

For her works on Islam, Sufism, and Muhammad Iqbal, a prominent philosopher and national poet of Pakistan, the government of Pakistan honored Schimmel with its highest civil awards, 
*Sitara-e-Imtiaz, or Star of Excellence, by Government of Pakistan
*Hilal-e-Imtiaz, or Crescent of Excellence, by Government of Pakistan

She was given other awards from many countries of the world, including the 1995 prestigious Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. This award caused a controversy in Germany, as she had defended the outrage of the Islamic world against Salman Rushdie, author of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988), a novel, in a television interview. Schimmel&#x27;s award speech is available online in translation, entitled &quot;A Good Word Is Like a Good Tree.&quot;

Among other awards and honors are the following.
* 1965 Friedrich Rückert Prize of the City of Schweinfurt, Germany
* 1978 Foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences
* 1980 Johann Heinrich Voss Prize for Translation from the German Academy for Language and Literature
* 1989 Grand Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany
* 1990 Golden Owl award of the German Socratic Society, for outstanding scholarship

* 2002 Muhammad Nafi Tschelebi Peace Prize of the Central Islamic Archive Institute of Germany, Soen, a prestigious award for Jewish-Christian-Muslim dialogue
* 2005 Name engraved in the &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; street in the City of Bonn

Schimmel also received honorary degrees from three Pakistani universities (Sind, Quaid-i-Azam, and Peshawar), from the Faculty of Theology at Uppsala University, Sweden (1986), and from Selçuk University in Turkey.

<text>The Fairmont Copley Plaza is a Forbes four-star, AAA four-diamond hotel in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It stands on Copley Square, part of an architectural ensemble that includes the John Hancock Tower, Henry Hobson Richardson&#x27;s Trinity Church, and Charles Follen McKim&#x27;s Boston Public Library.

The Fairmont Copley Plaza is recognized as one of the Historic Hotels of America, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is currently under consideration for local landmark status with the Boston Landmarks Commission.

==Construction and opening==
The Copley Plaza was built on the original site of the Museum of Fine Arts and named in honor of John Singleton Copley, an American painter. The total cost was $5.5 million.

The hotel&#x27;s architect was Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, who also designed other hotels, including the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. and the Plaza Hotel in New York City, the Copley Plaza&#x27;s sister hotel. The seven-floor hotel is constructed of limestone and buff brick in the Beaux-Arts style. The E-shaped building is supported by pilings driven to a depth of below the street level.

When it opened in 1912, Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald presided over a reception with over a thousand guests. Rooms had been booked as early as 16 months in advance. Its first manager, who also lived at the hotel, served for 22 years and he and the hotel were so prominent as to merit an obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. It became for some years the site of the annual Harvard-Yale dance and other post-football dances, denounced by the authorities of local women&#x27;s colleges who forbade their students from attending: &quot;These dances have nothing to do with the colleges in question, but have merely a financial interest in them. There is not doubt that they are of an extremely questionable nature owing to the fact that they are entirely opened to the public.&quot;

The hotel marked its centennial with another ribbon cutting ceremony by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino on August 16, 2012.

==Ownership==
Sheraton Hotels bought The Copley Plaza in 1941. They renamed it the Sheraton-Plaza Hotel in 1951 and operated it under that name until 1972, when they sold it to John Hancock Insurance for $6.5 million. The new owners renamed the hotel The Copley Plaza, but Sheraton continued to operate the property until 1974, when John Hancock hired Boston hospitality management firm Hotels of Distinction&#x27;s Alan Tremain to run The Copley Plaza. During this time, the restaurants in the hotel were considered some of the best in the city and featured such chefs as Lydia Shire, Jasper White, and Gordon Hamersley.

John Hancock sold the hotel in 1988 for $56 million to local businessman James A. Daley, in partnership with a subsidiary of Harvard University. In 1993, Harvard brought in Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts to manage The Copley Plaza and it became The Copley Plaza - A Wyndham Hotel.

In September 1996, Saudi Prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud and Olympus Real Estate Corporation partnered to buy the hotel from Harvard for $70 million. Fairmont Hotels, which Prince Al Waleed then owned a controlling interest in, assumed management of the hotel, which was renamed The Fairmont Copley Plaza Boston.

On September 21, 1999, Prince Al Waleed bought out Olympus&#x27;s share of the hotel, assuming 100% ownership. Between 1999 and 2001, Fairmont Hotels was significantly reorganized, with Prince Al Waleed only owning a 16.5% stake in the resulting company. On July 24, 2001, Fairmont Hotels bought a 50% stake in the hotel from Prince Al Waleed for $23 million. On February 11, 2003, Fairmont bought out Prince Al Waleed&#x27;s remaining 50% stake in the hotel for a further $23 million. By this point, Prince Al Waleed&#x27;s direct stake in Fairmont had decreased to 4.9%.

Fairmont sold the hotel to FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. in September 2010 for $98.5 million. This was part of Fairmont&#x27;s movement away from direct real estate ownership, but Fairmont continued to manage the hotel. FelCor was sold to RLJ Lodging Trust in April 2017, and RLJ sold the hotel in December 2017 to Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp. for $170 million. The hotel has more recently been branded simply as Fairmont Copley Plaza.

==Features==
The entrance hallway has been called &quot;Peacock Alley&quot; since the 1920s. The lobby has a high gilded coffered ceiling with matching Empire style crystal chandeliers and Italian marble columns. Much of the classical architecture and decor has been preserved, including the back-to-back &quot;P&quot; monogram.

The hotel is known for these industry firsts: the first hotel completely air-conditioned in Boston, the first hotel with an international reservations system, and the first to accept credit cards.

==Historical events==
From its opening, the hotel was a center of the social life of Boston&#x27;s elite. In 1913, Hamilton Fish, Jr., held a &quot;Lenten dance&quot; where &quot;society leaders ... from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Boston greeted the coming of daylight this morning at the Copley Plaza Hotel&quot;.

In the 1920s, John Singer Sargent kept rooms at the hotel and painted portraits there. Sargent used one of the hotel&#x27;s employees, a black elevator operator named Thomas McKeller, as the model for the Greek god Apollo in his decoration of Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts.

Frederick Kerry, paternal grandfather of US Senator John Kerry, committed suicide with a gunshot to the head in the restroom of this hotel on November 23, 1921.

In the 1930s, the Boston Horse Show awarded The Copley-Plaza Challenge Trophy.

In February 1935, civic leaders held a dinner for Babe Ruth at The Copley Plaza to celebrate his return to Boston after 16 years with the New York Yankees.

On August 3, 1940, back-up catcher for the Cincinnati Reds, Willard Hershberger, despondent over a series of losses in which he performed poorly, took his own life in the bathroom of his Hotel room at the Copley Plaza. He was discovered laying beside the tub with his throat slit. He was only 30 years old. His father had also committed suicide and he told Reds Manager, Bill McKechnie that he was going to &quot;do it, too ...&quot;

On March 29, 1979, a disgruntled former employee set multiple fires in both The Copley Plaza and the nearby Sheraton Boston hotels. The fire at the Copley Plaza, which was occupied by 430 people at the time, injured thirty and killed one. Among those injured was media mogul Sumner Redstone, who survived by hanging from a third-story window. His hand was partially paralyzed from the fire. Film director Rob Cohen was also rescued from the fire, which partly inspired his 1996 film &quot;Daylight&quot;.

==Celebrity guests==

The Copley Plaza Hotel has been host to many famous people. Every US President since William Howard Taft, and royalty from Greece, Thailand, Abyssinia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Belgium, Denmark, and the United Kingdom have visited the hotel. Celebrities including John Lennon, Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Frank Sinatra, and Luciano Pavarotti have also been guests. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton chose the Copley Plaza for their second honeymoon.

==In popular culture==

The climax of Robert B. Parker&#x27;s 1973 Spenser novel &quot;The Godwulf Manuscript&quot; takes place in Room 411 of the hotel.

The hotel provides the setting of a few scenes in the 1999 cult classic film &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;.

Other movies and TV shows filmed at the property include &quot;The Equalizer 2&quot;, &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;Bride Wars&quot;, and &quot;American Hustle&quot;.

The fictional Tipton Hotel from the Disney Channel Sitcom, &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; shares the same address as the real hotel, 138 St. James Avenue. This, along with the Hotel Vancouver would serve as the inspiration for the Tipton.

<text>Sten Gabriel Bernhard Forshufvud (9 February 1903 – 25 June 1985) was a Swedish dentist and physician, and amateur toxicologist (expert on poisons) who formulated and supported the controversial theory that Napoleon was assassinated by a member of his entourage while in exile. He wrote a book, in Swedish, about this in 1961, which was translated the following year as &quot;Who Killed Napoleon?&quot; He later published his ideas in English in the 1983 book &quot;Assassination At St. Helena: The Poisoning Of Napoleon Bonaparte,&quot; written in collaboration with Ben Weider, co-author (with David Hapgood) of the 1982 book &quot;The Murder Of Napoleon,&quot; which also advanced Forshufvud&#x27;s theories.

==Early life==
Forshufvud was born in Ramsele, Sweden and was the son of district medical officer Oscar Bengtsson and Eva Melin. He passed his &quot;studentexamen&quot; in Uddevalla in 1921 and passed his dental exam in 1924 and was active as a dental surgeon at the University of Bordeaux in 1934. Once back to Sweden, he carried on his studies in Biology at Lund University, where he conducted the research for his Ph.D. thesis in Medicine; this he published in 1941. Forshufvud received his doctor of odontology degree in 1949.

==Forensic investigation of Napoleon&#x27;s death==

===Experimentation===
Forshufvud tested five of Napoleon&#x27;s hairs with Ben Weider for traces of arsenic. They found fluctuations of arsenic levels ranging from normal to 38 times greater than average. This would purportedly suggest that Napoleon was given arsenic in different concentrations at different times for almost five years prior to his death.

===Controversy===
Forshufvud&#x27;s findings have been disputed since the hairs that were tested have never been decisively dated, or even proven to be Napoleon&#x27;s. However, all of the hair samples that Forshufvud had tested by an independent laboratory were family heirlooms that were handed down through generations. Plus all the samples were very similar. These hair samples were supposedly given to members of Napoleon&#x27;s staff and others he favored. Several samples of these hairs did not pass through Forshufvud&#x27;s hands and were sent directly to the testing laboratory in Scotland. All supported Forshufvud&#x27;s theory.

===Postulations===
Forshufvud and Weider suggested that their theory that Napoleon was assassinated by a Frenchman who served on Napoleon&#x27;s staff during his exile (their most likely suspect being Montholon) was repugnant to the French people, who now honor Napoleon as one of France&#x27;s great heroes. As a result, they understood that their &quot;proof of poisoning&quot; would always be questioned or ridiculed by those serving France.

==Personal life and death==
In his first marriage, in 1925, he married Karin Thorsell. In his second marriage, in 1950, he married Ulla-Britta Björkman (born 1925), the daughter of merchant Picco Björkman and Elsa Carlstedt. He was the father of Gull (born 1926), Ragnar (born 1931), Lennart (born 1951), Roland (born 1954) and Rickard (born 1957). Forshufvud died on 25 June 1985 in Gothenburg, Sweden. He is buried at Stampen Cemetery in Gothenburg.

<text>Quonset Point (), also known simply as Quonset, is a small peninsula in Narragansett Bay in the town of North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Its name is widely known from the Quonset hut, which was first manufactured there. &quot;Quonset&quot; is an Algonquian word meaning &quot;small, long place&quot;.

Quonset Point was the location of Naval Air Station Quonset Point, a large United States Navy base. The peninsula is now used for industrial purposes and is partially abandoned. A major industry located there is a hull-fabrication and outfitting facility for Electric Boat Corporation. It was also home to Camp Endicott, home to the Atlantic fleet Seabees.

Quonset Point is currently home to Quonset State Airport which is a joint civil-military public airport home to the Quonset Point Air National Guard Station and the 143d Airlift Wing (143 AW) of the Rhode Island Air National Guard, flying the C-130J Hercules.

==Port of Davisville==

In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided that the Port would be home to , a one-of-a-kind research vessel devoted entirely to exploring unknown parts of the world&#x27;s oceans. It is a former United States Navy surveillance ship acquired by the NOAA and converted into a deep-sea research vessel.

==Transportation==

Quonset Point can be reached by air and sea, as well as by road.

Rhode Island Route 403 is a freeway branching from Rhode Island Route 4 that serves the area. Quonset is also served by a railroad spur from Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. The Providence and Worcester Railroad provides freight service along this stretch of the Corridor.

Ferry service to and from Oak Bluffs, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard is provided by Rhode Island Fast Ferry, and the port of Davisville offers berths for commercial shipping. The Quonset Airport is a general aviation facility with a runway and a staffed control tower. Interstate 95 is nearby, and Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) buses also serve Quonset Point. 

==Ferry dock==
The ferry dock at Quonset Point is the main terminal for Rhode Island Fast Ferry&#x27;s high-speed ferry &quot;Julia Leigh&quot; to Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. A shuttle bus leaves every hour before the ferry departs; and after the ferry arrives, a bus travels to the Providence Airport (T. F. Green State Airport) and the Kingston Amtrak train station.

== Seabee Museum ==
Seabee Museum and Memorial Park in North Kingstown, Rhode Island is a museum dedicated to the men and women who served in the Battalion. It aims to highlight the deeds of the United States Naval Construction Battalions during both times of war and peace.

==Events==
=== Air show ===
The Rhode Island Air Show is held annually by the Rhode Island National Guard and is perhaps the most well-known event to take place on Quonset Point.
The event began in 1991 as a relatively minor aviation exhibition but grew in attendance each year, with the USAF Thunderbirds performing every even year and the USN Blue Angels performing every odd year. The Rhode Island National Guard also displayed their locally based C-130J Hercules aircraft and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters in combined forces demos. Military aircraft demonstrations that have been featured in the past have included the F-22 Raptor (2007, 2009 and 2014), F-16 Fighting Falcon (2003, 2009, 2011), A-10 Thunderbolt II (2006, 2010), F-15E Strike Eagle (2007, 2008), EA-6B Prowler (2012), F/A-18C Hornet (2006, 2008, 2010), F/A-18F Super Hornet (2007) and AV-8B Harrier (2008) while civilian performers have included Sean D. Tucker, John Klatt, and Michael Goulian as well as the GEICO Skytypers.
Attendance in 2011 was so high that the show was sold out after parking locations filled up. The 2012 show yielded a similar audience, and each previous year had a normal attendance of over 200,000.
However, in 2013 the show was officially canceled due to federal budget cuts, this caused all USAF units to cut aviation support to public events and the grounding of both the USN Blue Angels and USAF Thunderbirds, show organizers considered continuing the event as an all-civilian air show featuring aerobatic acts with the GEICO Skytypers being the headlining act however the National Guard stated that a show that exclusively featured civilian performers could not take place at a military installation, no such event took place in 2013.

In October 2013, internet rumors have surfaced about a possible 2014 show and how the Air National Guard was rounding up sponsors and performers for the event to return in 2014 with at least one major returning jet team to be featured, the USN Blue Angels which were supposed to headline in 2013 had already released their 2014 schedule which did not include Quonset while the USAF Thunderbirds which had headlined at the last show in 2012 had not yet released their schedule and a spokesperson for the team said that plans for the 2014 season were still underway.

In early December 2013, the Thunderbirds released their 2014 schedule which also did not include Quonset however show organizers are still planning to hold a conference regarding the event later in December. Without involvement by the Blue Angels or Thunderbirds it is still unlikely that a show will take place at Quonset.

To the shock of air show fans, on January 4, 2014, the Rhode Island Air National Guard Open House and Air Show was announced to take place on that year after a two-year hiatus in between. The show was scheduled for May 17–18, 2014, the Blue Angels headlining for the first time since 2011, The team made slight modifications to its schedule in late December following the abrupt cancellation of the MCAS Cherry Point Air Show, which was to take place the same weekend. Although the Cherry Point Air Show has since terminated its cancellation and will take place, the Blue Angels had already changed their schedule in order to appear at Quonset.

=== Other events ===
Former United States President Richard Nixon served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946, rising from Lieutenant Junior Grade to Lieutenant Commander. He underwent basic training at Quonset Point in 1942 where he met William P. Rogers, later his first Secretary of State.
During the 1950s, Quonset Point was home port for the aircraft carriers, , , and . During the 1960s and early 1970s, four aircraft carriers used Quonset Point as their home port. The carriers were , , , and .

<doc id="534513" wikidata="Q1760817" url="?curid=534513" title="South Wairarapa District">
<text>The South Wairarapa District is a district at the south-east tip of the North Island of New Zealand, governed by the South Wairarapa District Council. The district comprises the southernmost part of the Wairarapa, and is part of the Wellington Region.

==Features==
The district comprises the floodplain of the Ruamahanga River and the associated Lake Wairarapa, as well as the long southern stretch of Palliser Bay. To the west of the plains rise the eastern slopes of the Remutaka Range, the crest of which forms the western boundary of the district, while the Aorangi Range lies to the south-east. The southernmost point of the North Island, Cape Palliser, is in the South Wairarapa.

While it is predominantly rural, the South Wairarapa has three towns. The two largest towns, almost identical in population, are Greytown and Featherston. Greytown is where Arbor Day was first celebrated in New Zealand. The Fell Locomotive Museum in Featherston has a museum displaying the world&#x27;s only Fell locomotive. The third-largest town and the seat of the district council is Martinborough; it is the centre of a nationally important wine-producing area.

It is expected that the number of people living in the district&#x27;s urban areas will increase due to rising property prices in Wellington proper, and the proximity to transport links.

==Demographics==
South Wairarapa District covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

==Transport==

Because of South Wairarapa&#x27;s proximity to the capital city of New Zealand, Wellington, there are close links between the two areas. For example, some people live in South Wairarapa and commute to Wellington each day to work; others live and work in Wellington while spending weekends in South Wairarapa. The Wairarapa Line, part of the Metlink public transport network for the Wellington region, passes through the district (which is served by the two stations of Featherston and Woodside) and provides a faster method of transport into the city than the Remutaka pass road. Metlink buses also provide services to Greytown and Martinborough from the railway stations and Masterton.
==Local and regional government==
The South Wairarapa District Council is the territorial authority responsible for the area. The council consists of nine councillors; the current mayor is Martin Connelly. The three towns also have their own community boards.

<text>Arkle (19 April 1957 – 31 May 1970) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse. A bay gelding by Archive out of Bright Cherry, Arkle was the grandson of the unbeaten (in 14 races) flat racehorse and prepotent sire Nearco. Arkle was bred by Mary Baker of Malahow House, near Naul, County Dublin, Ireland, and was born at Ballymacoll Stud, County Meath. He was owned by Anne Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster, who named him after the mountain Arkle in Sutherland, Scotland, that bordered her Sutherland estate. Trained by Tom Dreaper at Greenogue, Kilsallaghan, in County Dublin, he was ridden during his steeplechasing career by Pat Taaffe.

Arkle won three Cheltenham Gold Cups and a number of other top races before his career was cut short by injury. At 212, his Timeform rating is the highest ever awarded to a steeplechaser.

==Early life==
Arkle, a bay colt with no white markings, was bred by Mary Baker, who kept a few mares on the family farm at Malahow, near Naul in County Dublin. His dam was Bright Cherry, who had won seven times over jumps. His sire was Archive, who, although the offspring of leading sire Nearco, had never won a race and stood at the modest fee of 48 guineas. Arkle was foaled at Ballymacoll Stud in County Meath on 19 April 1957. He was gelded as a yearling.

In August 1960, the yet unnamed gelding was sent to Goff&#x27;s Bloodstock Sales in Ballsbridge, Dublin, where he was bought for 1,150 guineas by Tom Dreaper on behalf of the Duchess of Westminster. His new owner named him Arkle after a mountain overlooking her Scottish estate. After spending a year at Eaton Hall, the Westminster estate in Cheshire, Arkle returned to Ireland in August 1961 to go into training at Tom Dreaper&#x27;s yard, Greenogue, at Kilsallaghan, north of Dublin.

==Racing career==

===1961/1962 National Hunt season===
Arkle&#x27;s first racecourse appearance was on 9 December 1961 at Mullingar, where he came third of seventeen in the Lough Ennel Plate, a bumper. It was a race for amateur riders, and he was ridden by the Hon. Mark Hely-Hutchinson, son of Lord Donoughmore (one of Dreaper&#x27;s major owners). On St Stephen&#x27;s Day 1961, Arkle ran in another bumper, at Leopardstown. Again ridden by Hely-Hutchinson, he came fourth of ten.

In January 1962, Arkle had his first race over jumps in the Bective Novice Hurdle over three miles at Navan. Stable jockey Pat Taaffe had elected to ride the favourite Kerforo and the ride on Arkle was taken by stable lad Liam McLoughlin. Arkle defeated 26 runners to win by lengths, prompting his trainer to say &quot;I think we&#x27;ve got something there!&quot; In his next race, the Rathconnel Handicap Hurdle over two miles at Naas, he was ridden for the first time by Taaffe. Starting at 2/1 favourite in a field of ten, he won by four lengths.

The season ended with two defeats in April 1962. Arkle, ridden by McLoughlin, finished unplaced in the two-mile Balbriggen Hurdle at Baldoyle, the only time in his career he would finish outside the first four. The pair then finished fourth in the New Handicap Hurdle at Fairyhouse, before Arkle went to spend the summer on his owner&#x27;s farm at Bryanstown House, Maynooth, County Kildare.

===1962/1963 National Hunt season===
The five-year-old Arkle started the 1962/1963 season with two wins over hurdles in Ireland, ridden on one occasion by Taaffe and on the other, when Taaffe was unable to make the weight, by his regular work rider, Paddy Woods. On 17 November 1962, Arkle ran for the first time over steeplechase fences in the Honeybourne Chase at Cheltenham. Ridden by Taaffe, who would go on to ride him in all his subsequent races over fences, Arkle started at 11/8 favourite and won by 20 lengths. It was his first race in England, and his victory earned him a mention in &quot;The Times&quot;, where he was described as a &quot;promising type&quot;. As a preparation for the 1963 Cheltenham Festival, Arkle was entered in the Milltown Novice Chase at Leopardstown in February. He went off as 1/2 favourite and won by eight lengths. The race was later renamed the Arkle Novice Chase in his honour.

In March 1963, Arkle made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival. Having gone off as 4/9 favourite in the Broadway Novices&#x27; Chase, he put on a turn of speed from the second last, and won by twenty lengths. The season ended with two more victories in Ireland before Arkle went on his customary summer break at Bryanstown.

===1963/1964 National Hunt season===
Arkle started the season with a win in the Donoughmore Plate, a flat race at Navan, in which he was ridden by former champion jockey T. P. Burns. There followed an easy victory in the Carey&#x27;s Cottage Handicap Chase at Gowran Park, before he set off for England and a much-anticipated first meeting with the 1963 Gold Cup winner Mill House in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury. In a field of ten, Mill House went off as 15/8 favourite and conceded 5 lbs to Arkle, who started at 5/2. Arkle was just a length behind the leader Mill House at the third last, when he slipped after landing and took a while to recover his momentum, finishing in third place.

There were three victories for Arkle in Ireland, in the Christmas Handicap Chase, the Thyestes Handicap Chase and the Leopardstown Handicap Chase, before another meeting with Mill House in the 1964 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Arkle avenged his previous defeat by beating Mill House (who had won the race the previous year) by five lengths to claim his first Gold Cup at odds of 7/4 with another previous winner and top-class chaser, Pas Seul, twenty-five lengths back in third place, and Kings Nephew, the only horse to have previously beaten Mill House, last of the four runners. It was the last time he did not start as the favourite for a race. Only two other horses entered the Gold Cup that year – and that became the norm for the next two years, for there was no point in taking on Arkle at level weights – so the remaining runners were racing for place money only.

Three weeks after his victory at Cheltenham, Arkle ran in the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse. The racing authorities in Ireland took the unprecedented step in the Irish Grand National of devising two weight systems – one to be used when Arkle was running, and one when he was not. Arkle won the 1964 race by only one length, but he carried 30 lbs more than his rivals.

===1964/1965 National Hunt season===
After a warm-up race in Ireland, Arkle returned to Newbury to avenge his defeat by Mill House in the previous year&#x27;s Hennessy Gold Cup. In a field of nine, Arkle started at 5/4 favourite, with Mill House at 15/8. Taaffe let Arkle go to the front and jump alongside Mill House, who had nothing left as they entered the straight. Arkle strode away to win by ten lengths, with Mill House beaten into fourth place. Just a week later, Arkle was running in the Massey Ferguson Gold Cup at Cheltenham. He was beaten a length into third place by the grey mare Flying Wild, to whom he was conceding 32 lbs.

Arkle returned to Ireland to win the Leopardstown Handicap Chase for a second time before retaining his crown in the 1965 Cheltenham Gold Cup, this time beating Mill House by twenty lengths. His final race of the season was the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown Park. In spite of giving away at least 35 lbs to his six rivals, Arkle won by five lengths and netted the largest prize of his career to date, £8,230.

===1965/1966 National Hunt season===
Arkle was unbeaten in his five starts in the 1965/1966 season, winning the Gallaher Gold Cup at Sandown, the Hennessy Gold Cup for a second time, the King George VI Chase by a distance at Kempton, the Leopardstown Handicap Chase for the third time (beating Height O&#x27;Fashion by a neck conceding 42lbs in Arkle&#x27;s first photo finish decider ), and the Cheltenham Gold Cup for the third time. 

In the 1966 renewal, he was the shortest-priced favourite in history to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, starting at odds of 1/10. He won the race by thirty lengths, hard held, from Dormant and just three other rivals, despite a mistake early in the race where he ploughed through the eleventh fence, while looking at his adoring fans in the stands. However, it did not stop his momentum, nor did he ever look like falling. Arkle had a strange quirk in that he crossed his forelegs when jumping a fence.

===1966/1967 National Hunt season===
In November 1966, Arkle returned to Newbury to attempt a third consecutive victory in the Hennessy Gold Cup. Without a preparatory race, having not run for eight months and having suffered a setback in training two weeks earlier, faced five rivals all of whom carried at least 33lbs less than him. It was outsider Stalbridge Colonist, receiving 35lbs, who challenged Arkle on the run-in and won by half a length. The scale of the task Arkle faced is shown by the race-fit winner coming a close second and third in the two following Cheltenham Gold Cups, while in third place receiving 33lbs was the future 1969 Gold Cup winner, What A Myth. It was Arkle&#x27;s first defeat in nearly two years; racing commentator Peter O&#x27;Sullevan described it as &quot;a magnificent, noble effort&quot;.

Arkle returned to his winning ways eighteen days later, when he landed the SGB Handicap Chase at Ascot carrying his usual top weight of 12st 7lbs. He actually conceded 35lbs to Vultrix, himself a top-class chaser who had won the race the previous year carrying top weight of 12st 1lb, and Arkle destroyed him by 15 lengths, at which his trainer, Ryan Price, remarked that &quot;Arkle is a living phenomenon&quot;. On 27 December 1966, Arkle ran in the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park but struck the guard rail with a hoof when jumping the open ditch, which resulted in a fractured pedal bone; despite this injury, he completed the race and was only overtaken on the run-in to finish second, a half-length behind the winner, Dormant, to whom he was still conceding 21lbs. Visibly lame, Arkle was loaded into the horse-ambulance and taken back to the racecourse stables, where he remained for two months, his injured leg encased in plaster.

==Retirement==
Arkle was in plaster for four months and, though he made a good enough recovery to go back into training, he never ran again. He was retired and ridden as a hack at Bryanstown by his owner but in 1969 his condition deteriorated and he began to show signs of stiffness in his hind legs, possibly due to arthritis. As he found it increasingly difficult to walk and appeared to be in pain, he was put down in his box at Bryanstown on 31 May 1970 at the age of thirteen. He was buried in his field at Bryanstown.

==Legacy==
Arkle, known simply as &quot;Himself&quot;, became a national hero and a legend during his lifetime. 

Fan mail, sometimes addressed only to &quot;Arkle, Ireland&quot;, arrived at the Greenogue yard from all over the world. When it was revealed that two pints of Guinness were added to his regular feed of oats every day, the Company undertook to supply the yard with a free supply in recognition of the &quot;pleasant publicity&quot;.

At 212, Arkle&#x27;s Timeform rating is the highest ever awarded to a steeplechaser. Only Flyingbolt, also trained by Dreaper, had a rating anywhere near his at 210. Next on their ratings are Sprinter Sacre on 192 and then Kauto Star and Mill House on 191. In 2004 he narrowly beat Desert Orchid to be named all-time favourite British or Irish racehorse in a Racing Post poll.

Arkle put in various public appearances including, after his retirement, one at the Horse of the Year Show in 1969. He has been celebrated in songs, appeared on stamps, and is commemorated with statues. In 1972 the Duchess of Westminster unveiled a statue at Cheltenham racecourse; in 2014 a 1.1 scale bronze statue was unveiled in Ashbourne, County Meath, the nearest town to the Greenogue yard.

Two races, both Grade 1, have been named in Arkle&#x27;s honour: in 1969 the Arkle Challenge Trophy replaced the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham Racecourse; and the Milltown Novice Chase at Leopardstown was renamed the Arkle Novice Chase.

In 1976, the controversial decision was made to exhume Arkle&#x27;s remains and to mount his skeleton for display at the Irish National Stud. Amongst those who disapproved was Arkle&#x27;s jockey Taaffe, who said: &quot;I hated seeing his frame up there. I couldn&#x27;t look at him for long&quot;.

==Race record==
Arkle won 27 of his 35 starts, including 22 wins from 26 steeplechases, and he was placed in the other four races with mitigating circumstances for each defeat. He carried more than 12th in weight in 14 of his races, and won at distances from 1m 6f on the Flat up to 3m 5f over fences.

Besides winning three consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups (1964, 1965, 1966) and the 1965 King George VI Chase, Arkle triumphed in a number of other important handicap chases, including the 1964 Irish Grand National (under 12-0), the 1964 and 1965 Hennessy Gold Cups (both times under 12-7), the 1965 Gallaher Gold Cup (conceding 16 lb to Mill House while breaking the course record by 17 seconds), and the 1965 Whitbread Gold Cup (under 12-7). In the 1966 Hennessy, he failed by only half a length to give Stalbridge Colonist 35 lb.

<text>A fabliau (; plural fabliaux) is a comic, often anonymous tale written by jongleurs in northeast France between c. 1150 and 1400. They are generally characterized by sexual and scatological obscenity, and by a set of contrary attitudes—contrary to the church and to the nobility. Several of them were reworked by Giovanni Boccaccio for the &quot;Decameron&quot; and by Geoffrey Chaucer for his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. Some 150 French &quot;fabliaux&quot; are extant, the number depending on how narrowly &quot;fabliau&quot; is defined. According to R. Howard Bloch, &quot;fabliaux&quot; are the first expression of literary realism in Europe.

Some nineteenth-century scholars, most notably Gaston Paris, argue that &quot;fabliaux&quot; originally came from the Orient and were brought to the West by returning crusaders.

==History and definition of the genre==
The &quot;fabliau&quot; is defined as a short narrative in (usually octosyllabic) verse, between 300 and 400 lines long, its content often comic or satiric. In France, it flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries; in England, it was popular in the 14th century. &quot;Fabliaux&quot; are often compared to the later short story; Douglas Bush, longtime professor at Harvard University, called it &quot;a short story broader than it is long.&quot;

The &quot;fabliau&quot; is remarkable in that it seems to have no direct literary predecessor in the West, but was brought from the East by returning crusaders in the 12th century. The closest literary genre is the fable as found in Aesop &quot;and its eastern origins or parallels,&quot; but it is less moral and less &quot;didactic&quot; than the fable. The word is a northern French diminutive from &quot;fable&quot;..&quot; In terms of morality it is suggested to be closer to the novel than to the parable: &quot;the story is the first thing, the moral the second, and the latter is never suffered to interfere with the former.&quot; Still, according to Robert Lewis, &quot;some two-thirds of the French &quot;fabliaux&quot; have an explicit moral attached to them.&quot;

The earliest known &quot;fabliau&quot; is the anonymous &quot;Richeut&quot; (c. 1159–1175); one of the earliest known writers of &quot;fabliaux&quot; is Rutebeuf, &quot;the prototype of the jongleur of medieval literature.&quot;

The genre has been quite influential: passages in longer medieval poems such as &quot;Le Roman de Renart&quot; as well as tales found in collections like Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; and Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; have their origin in one or several &quot;fabliaux&quot;. Additionally, the medieval church also found use for the &quot;fabliau&quot; form. Noting its popularity, the church turned to their own form of minstrelsy similar to the &quot;fabliau&quot; that espoused &quot;worthy thoughts&quot; rather than the &quot;ribaldry&quot; a more typical &quot;fabliau&quot; would couch its moral in.

When the &quot;fabliau&quot; gradually disappeared, at the beginning of the 16th century, it was replaced by the prose short story, which was greatly influenced by its predecessor. Famous French writers such as Molière, Jean de La Fontaine, and Voltaire owe much to the tradition of the &quot;fabliau&quot;.

==Characteristics==

===Cast of characters, audience===
Typical &quot;fabliaux&quot; contain a vast array of characters, including cuckolded husbands, rapacious clergy, and foolish peasants, as well as beggars, connivers, thieves, and whores. Two groups are often singled out for criticism: the clergy and women. The status of peasants appears to vary, based on the audience for which the &quot;fabliau&quot; was being written. Poems that were presumably written for the nobility portray peasants (&quot;vilains&quot; in French) as stupid and vile, whereas those written for the lower classes often tell of peasants getting the better of the clergy.

The audience for &quot;fabliaux&quot; is estimated differently by different critics. Joseph Bédier suggests a bourgeois audience, which sees itself reflected in the urban settings and lower-class types portrayed in &quot;fabliaux&quot;. On the other hand, Per Nykrog argues that &quot;fabliaux&quot; were directed towards a noble audience, and concludes that &quot;fabliaux&quot; were the impetus for literary refreshment.

===Subject matter===

The subject matter is often sexual: &quot;fabliaux&quot; are concerned with the elements of love left out by poets who wrote in the more elevated genres such as Ovid, who suggests in the &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot; (II.704–5) that the Muse should not enter the room where the lovers are in bed; and Chrétien de Troyes, who maintains silence on the exact nature of the joy discovered by Lancelot and Guinevere in &quot;Le Chevalier de la Charrette&quot; (4676–4684). &quot;Lais&quot; and &quot;fabliaux&quot; have much in common; an example of a poem straddling the fence between the two genres is &quot;Lecheor&quot;.

&quot;Fabliaux&quot; derive a lot of their force from puns and other verbal figures; &quot;fabliaux . . . are obsessed with wordplay.&quot; Especially important are paranomasia and catachresis, tropes which disrupt ordinary signification and displace ordinary meanings—by similarity of sound, for instance, one can have both &quot;con&quot; and &quot;conte&quot; (&quot;cunt&quot; and &quot;tale&quot;) in the same word, a common pun in &quot;fabliaux&quot;.

Bacon is one of the commonest foodstuffs in, and a common subject in, the &quot;fabliau&quot;.

===Form===
The standard form of the &quot;fabliau&quot; is that of Medieval French literature in general, the octosyllable rhymed couplet, the most common verse form used in verse chronicles, romances (the &quot;romans&quot;), &quot;lais&quot;, and &quot;dits&quot;. They are generally short, a few hundred lines; Douin de L&#x27;Avesne&#x27;s &quot;Trubert&quot;, at 2984 lines, is exceptionally long.

==Authors and tales==
Famous writers of &quot;fabliaux&quot; include Jean Bodel, Guèrin, Gautier le Leu, Rutebeuf, Enguerrant le Clerc d&#x27;Oisi and Douin de L&#x27;Avesne.

Some representative tales:

===&quot;Gombert et les deus clers&quot;===
A well-known storyline is found in &quot;Gombert et les deus clers&quot; (&quot;Gombert and the two clerks&quot;). Two traveling clerks (students) take up lodging with a &quot;villain&quot;, and share the bedroom with Gombert, his beautiful wife, and their two children—one teenage girl, and one baby. One of the clerks climbs into bed with the teenage daughter and, promising her his ring, has his way with her; the other, while Gombert is &quot;ala pissier&quot; (&quot;gone pissing&quot;, 85), moves the crib with the baby so that Gombert, on his return, lies down in the bed occupied by the clerks—one of whom is in bed with his daughter, while the other is now having sex with Gombert&#x27;s wife, who thinks it is Gombert come to pleasure her. When the first clerk returns to his bed where he thinks his friend still is, he tells Gombert all about his adventure: &quot;je vien de fotre / mes que ce fu la fille a l&#x27;oste&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve just been fucking, and if it wasn&#x27;t the host&#x27;s daughter&quot;, 152–53). Gombert attacks the first clerk, but ends up being beaten up by both.

The tale is found practically unchanged in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; and in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

===&quot;L&#x27;enfant de neige&quot;===
In &quot;L&#x27;enfant de neige&quot; (&quot;The snow baby&quot;), a black comedy, a merchant returns home after an absence of two years to find his wife with a newborn son. She explains one snowy day she swallowed a snowflake while thinking about her husband, which caused her to conceive. Pretending to believe the &quot;miracle&quot;, they raise the boy until the age of 15 when the merchant takes him on a business trip to Genoa. There, he sells the boy into slavery. On his return, he explains to his wife that the sun burns bright and hot in Italy; since the boy was begotten by a snowflake, he melted in the heat.

===&quot;Bérangier au lonc cul&quot; (Bérangier of the long arse)===

&quot;De Bérangier au lonc cul&quot; is a medieval French &quot;fabliau&quot;. There are two versions of the &quot;fabliau&quot;: one by Guèrin and one anonymous. In summary, the story begins when a rich earl marries his daughter off to a &quot;young peasant&quot; and deems him a knight. The knight abandons the code of chivalry and lazes around for the first ten years of the marriage. When his wife, tired of his demeaning attitude and lazy nature, speaks of the greatness of the knights in her family, the husband decides to prove himself a worthy knight. He dresses in armor and goes into the forest on horseback. Once in the forest, he hangs his shield on the lowest branch of a tree and beats it until it looks as if it endured a great battle. The knight returns to his wife, shows her his bruised armor, and gloats about his victories. After a few trips into the forest, the wife begins to wonder why the knight himself is unscathed while his armor is in shambles. The next day, she suggests he take servants with him. When he refuses, the lady dresses in a full body suit of armor and follows him into the forest. When she sees him beating his own shield, she steps into sight and threatens to kill him for his dishonor to chivalry. The knight does not recognize his wife&#x27;s voice. He begs for &quot;pity&quot; and offers to do anything to avoid conflict. His wife, disguised as a mighty knight, gives him the option of jousting her, in which he will surely die, or kissing her arse. Out of cowardice, the knight chooses to kiss her arse. She hops off her horse and pulls down her pants. While the knight should have recognized her female genitalia, he remarks that she has a long arse. Before she leaves, she tells him, &quot;I&#x27;m Bérangier of the Long Ass, Who puts shame to the chickenhearted.&quot; The wife returns home and sleeps with a valiant knight. When her husband arrives from the forest, he rebukes her. However, that was his last demeaning remark to her. She tells him she met Bérangier and learned of her husband&#x27;s cowardice. To protect his own name, the knight is forced to succumb to his wife&#x27;s wishes. Her cleverness leads her to do as she pleased for the rest of her life, and her husband lives in shame.

===Other examples===
Other popular &quot;fabliaux&quot; include:

*&quot;La vielle qui graissa la patte de chevalier&quot; (&quot;The old woman who paid the knight for favors.&quot;)
*&quot;Le Pauvre Clerc&quot; (&quot;The poor clerk&quot;)
*&quot;Le Couverture partagée&quot; (&quot;The shared covering&quot;)
*&quot;Le Pretre qui mangea les mûres&quot; (&quot;The priest who ate mulberries&quot;)
*&quot;La crotte&quot; (&quot;The turd&quot;)
*&quot;Le Chevalier qui fit les cons parler&quot; (&quot;The Knight who made cunts speak&quot;) by Guèrin
*(&quot;Dit de&quot;) &quot;La vieille Truande&quot; (&quot;The old beggar woman&quot;)
*&quot;Du prestre ki abevete&quot; (&quot;The priest who peeked&quot;) by Guèrin

<doc id="534521" wikidata="Q547962" url="?curid=534521" title="Solandra maxima">
<text>Solandra maxima is a flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is also known as cup of gold vine, golden chalice vine, Copa de Oro, or Hawaiian lily, is a vigorous vine which is endemic to Mexico and Central America. It has very large yellow flowers and glossy leaves. It is often planted as an ornamental plant.

==Description==
It is a fast-growing, 12 m (40 ft) tall climbing vine (occasionally as much as 165 feet (fifty meters) in length ) , which is often pruned back in cultivation to a shrub with overhanging twigs. All parts of the plant are poisonous. The leaves are alternately arranged, broad-elliptical to oblong, 5-18 × 2-9 cm in size, leathery, glossy on top and usually short-acuminate.

===Flowers===
The funnel-shaped flowers are usually solitary. The calyx is 5-8 cm long, pentagonal and consists of three to five cusps. The corolla is 15-24 cm long and consists of large, rounded, 8-15 cm wide lobes. The flower is creamy white to light yellow at the start of flowering and changes color to ocher to orange during flowering. Violet or brown bands run deep into the flower tube across the center of the corolla. Five stamens protrude from the flower tube. The flowers open in the evening, exuding a pungent scent. This attracts bats as pollinators. The fruits are round, up to 7 cm large berries on which the sepals are preserved.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-126 (NATO reporting name: Moss) was an airborne early warning and control aircraft developed from the Tupolev Tu-114 airliner by the Tupolev design bureau. It was in service with the armed forces of the Soviet Union from 1965 to 1984.

==Design and development==
In 1958 increasing concern over the threat of an American nuclear strike against the USSR from the north led to a new requirement for an airborne radar system, which would avoid the problems and expense of attempting to create a land-based radar system to cover all of the enormous Soviet northern coast. The Tupolev Design Bureau was ordered to design an AEW&amp;C aircraft. After trying to fit the projected radar instrumentation in a Tu-95 and a Tu-116, a decision was made to use the Tupolev Tu-114 with its wider fuselage instead. This solved problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 designs. To adhere to the flight range requirements, the plane was fitted with an air-to-air refuelling probe. The Tu-126 had a crew of 12 and carried the &quot;Liana&quot; radar (NATO reporting name &quot;Flap Jack&quot;) in a rotodome mounted above the fuselage. It had no look-down capability, so the switch by NATO to low level penetration made it fairly irrelevant.

The first prototype Tu-126 flew on 23 January 1962. Testing, which continued through the autumn of 1964, showed that while the radar was effective over water, performance was poorer over land. It was also found that the large contra-rotating propellers of the four engines seriously compromised the performance of the radar. This problem was only marginally countered by the installation of a new radar called &quot;Shmel&quot;.

==Operational history==

The Tu-126 entered service in 1965, although it was only identified by Western intelligence in 1968 after appearing in a Soviet documentary film. Eight production aircraft were built in addition to the prototype from between 1965 and 1968 and all were nominally based at Šiauliai Air Base. Western intelligence estimated that its radar performance was inferior to Western equivalents, that it was unable to detect cruise missiles or small aircraft at low level. However, it was assessed that the Tu-126 had powerful jamming equipment. The Tu-126 was used by the Soviet Air Force, until being replaced by the Beriev A-50. The last Tu-126 was retired in 1984.

<text>Stephen Paul Fleming (born 1 April 1973) is a cricket coach and former captain of the New Zealand national cricket team. He was a left-handed opening batter and an occasional right arm slow medium bowler. He is New Zealand&#x27;s second-most capped Test cricketer with 111 appearances. He is also the team&#x27;s longest-serving and most successful captain with 28 test victories and led the team to win the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, the team&#x27;s first International Cricket Council trophy. Fleming captained New Zealand in the first ever Twenty20 International against Australia in 2005.

Fleming retired from international cricket on 26 March 2008. He played in the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League for Chennai Super Kings and became the team&#x27;s coach in 2009. He is the team&#x27;s current head coach and has coached them to five IPL and two Champions League T20 titles. He also serves as the head coach of other Super Kings franchises, Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 and Texas Super Kings in Major League Cricket. He served as the coach of Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League from 2015 to 2019. Fleming was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to cricket, in the 2011 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

==Early and personal life==
Fleming was born on 1 April 1973 in Christchurch to Pauline Fleming and Gary Kirk. Pauline raised him as a single mother, and he did not meet his father until he was 16. Fleming played rugby for Cashmere High like his father. 

On 9 May 2007, Fleming married his long-term partner Kelly Payne in a ceremony in Wellington. The couple have a daughter, born in 2006.

==Domestic career==
Fleming has played county cricket in England for Middlesex, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. He captained Nottinghamshire to County Championship victory in 2005, their first Championship title in 18 years.

==International career==
A left-handed batsman, Fleming made his test debut in March 1994 in the home series against India winning the Man of the Match award on debut after scoring 92. He made his ODI debut on 25 March 1994 in the first match of the ODI series that followed and scored an unbeaten 90. In England&#x27;s tour of New Zealand in 1996–97, he scored his maiden test century in the first test at Auckland. In the third Test of the series, he took over the captaincy from Lee Germon becoming New Zealand&#x27;s youngest captain at 23 years and 321 days. He led the New Zealand team to a bronze medal in the 1998 Commonwealth Games. 

Fleming led the team to win the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, which was New Zealand&#x27;s first ICC trophy. Fleming became New Zealand&#x27;s most successful test captain in September 2000 with a victory over Zimbabwe which was the 12th win under his captaincy overtaking Geoff Howarth and finished with 28 wins, the most by a New Zealand captain. Fleming&#x27;s scored his best ODI score with an unbeaten 134 to help New Zealand beat hosts South Africa in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Chasing a rain adjusted target of 229 off 39 overs, Fleming hit 134 off just 132 deliveries as New Zealand cruised to a 9-wicket victory. In February 2005, Fleming captained New Zealand in the first ever Twenty20 International against Australia. In the second Test between New Zealand and South Africa at Cape Town in April 2006, Fleming scored his 3rd Test double-century and became the first New Zealander to achieve this feat.

On 25 October 2006, Fleming captained his country for the 194th time in an ODI overtaking Arjuna Ranatunga for most matches as a captain and finished with 218 games as a captain, a record which has since been eclipsed only by Ricky Ponting. He captained the side in the 2007 World Cup and scored 353 runs at an average of 39.22, leading the team to the semi-finals. On 24 April 2007, Fleming resigned as captain in a post-match press conference held after the semi-Final defeat to Sri Lanka. In September 2007, Fleming was replaced by Daniel Vettori as the New Zealand captain. Fleming confirmed his retirement from the New Zealand team at the end of England&#x27;s 2008 tour of New Zealand to spend more time with his family, and to play for the Indian Premier League. Fleming scored over 7000 runs in test cricket and took over 170 catches, the third highest Test aggregate for a non-wicket keeper.

==IPL career==
Fleming was acquired by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$350,000 for the inaugural season of Indian Premier League. He played just one season and scored 196 runs in ten matches with CSK finishing as runners-up.

==Post retirement==
Fleming was appointed as the head coach of Chennai Super Kings in 2009 when he retired as a player. Under his coaching, CSK won the 2010 season and qualified for Champions League Twenty20. Chennai won the 2010 Champions league. Fleming coached CSK to its second consecutive IPL title in 2011 and its second Champions League Twenty20 title in 2014. 

Following the two-year suspension of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, two new franchises Rising Pune Supergiants and Gujarat Lions were established for the 2016 Indian Premier League season. Supergiants appointed Fleming as the head coach. Fleming returned to Chennai Super Kings for the 2018 season. Fleming coached CSK to its third IPL title in 2018. Fleming led CSK to the title again in 2021 and 2023 IPL. CSK became the most successful IPL franchise with five title wins and ten final appearances during his stint as head coach. He was appointed as the head coach of other Super Kings franchises, Joburg Super Kings of SA20 in 2022 and Texas Super Kings of Major League Cricket in 2023.

===Business interests===
Fleming has been involved in setting up CricHQ with the company&#x27;s CEO Simon Baker and former New Zealand cricket captain Brendon McCullum. Fleming is one of the investors and a director in the company. In June 2015, the company raised US$10m from Singapore private equity firm Tembusu Partners.

==Playing style==
Fleming was an elegant left handed batter and played shots such as the flick off the pads, straight drive, cover drive and cut shots. He was also a prolific slip catcher and was particularly noted for his captaincy, having been praised by Shane Warne as the &quot;best captain in world cricket&quot;.

<text>Miagao (also written Miag-ao), officially the Municipality of Miagao (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 68,115 people.

Miagao is considered as the &quot;Onion Capital of the Visayas&quot;. The town center of the municipality lies on the western bank of the Tumagbok River, the largest river in the municipality. The poblacion is made up of eight barangays.

The town holds their patronal fiesta in honor of St. Thomas of Villanova (more commonly known as Santo Tomas de Villanueva) every September 22 that lasts several days. The town is also the location of one of the Baroque Churches of the Philippines, the Miagao Church, which was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The entire town of Miagao was later inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage City and became a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC).

==Etymology==
The name of Miagao has many disputed etymologies. One of the most popular, and probably the most widely accepted version is that the name of the town was derived from a plant named &quot;Miagos&quot;. &quot;Miagos&quot; or &quot;Osmoxylon lineare&quot; is a flowering plant from the family Araliaceae that used to grow abundantly in the area when the Spaniards came. Because of its abundance in the area, the Spaniards named the place Miagos which later became Miagao. Another version, according to Rev. Fr. Lorenzo Torres of Igbaras, is that a native named &quot;Miyagaw&quot; was asked by the Spaniards for the name of the place but gave his name instead.

==History==
A settlement in Damilisan were recorded by Spanish Map early in 1700 with 13,493 people and 2,974 houses. Miagao gained its independence as a municipality in 1716 . Prior to that, it used to be a part of an &quot;arrabal&quot; of four different towns in southern Iloilo. Until 1580, Miagao was an arrabal of Oton. From 1580 until 1652, it was an arrabal of Tigbauan. It was an arrabal of Suaraga (now San Joaquin) from 1652 to 1703 and before becoming independent, it became an arrabal of Guimbal from 1703 to 1716. In 1731, Miagao had its first capitan and teniente mayor (now equivalent to mayor and vice mayor) after an election was held in Guimbal under the supervision of Victorino C. Ma., an authorized representative of the governor.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Miagao is a coastal town with a hilly to mountainous terrain. Most of the flat areas in the municipality are found either in coasts or along the town&#x27;s major rivers which include the Naulid, Tumagbok, Oyaoy, Bacauan, Tabunacan, Oyungan, Lanutan, and San Rafael rivers. A mountain range forms a natural boundary between Miagao and the province of Antique to the north.

The highest point in the municipality is the summit of Mount Tulajon, locally spelled as Tulahong, at 1,100 meters asl located in Barangay Ongyod.

===Climate===
The municipality has a type I climate based on PAGASA&#x27;s climate classification chart. The climate of Miagao is greatly affected by north-east and south-west monsoons. The town experiences a pronounced wet season from May to October and a dry season from November to April. The coolest months are the months of December to February while the hottest months are the months of April and May.
===Barangays===



Miagao is politically subdivided into 119 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

It has more barangays than any other municipality in the Philippines. The municipality has 22 coastal barangays and 97 landlocked barangays.

==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of Miagao was 68,115 people, with a density of .

===Languages===
Almost all people in Miag-ao speak Kinaray-a as it is the primary language of the municipality. Hiligaynon is spoken as a second language by many and is especially useful when going to Iloilo City where Hiligaynon is the dominant language.

== Healthcare ==
The municipality&#x27;s healthcare services is under the management of the Miagao Municipal Health Office (MHO), headed by its Municipal Health Officer, Rural Health Physicians, Nurses, Midwives, and other allied health workers and staff. The MHO is directly under the administration of the Local Government Unit.

*Out-patient Clinic
*Birthing Clinic
*Animal Bite Treatment Center
*DOTS Center and COVID-19 Swabbing Center
*The 19 Barangay Health Stations (BHS) spread across the municipality
**The Main Health Center (MHC) caters to three BHS, namely: MHC-A, MHC-B, and MHC-C

There are also other private medical, dental and veterinary clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies located primarily in the poblacion area.

== Economy ==
===Agriculture===

The municipality of Miagao is a largely agricultural town. Around 52% of the municipal land area is classified as agricultural and around 40% of the total land area is planted. Rice is the primary crop of the town while corn is considered as a secondary crop.

Miagao is hailed as the &quot;Onion Capital of the Visayas&quot; because it is the largest producer of bulb onion not only in Western Visayas but in the whole Visayas and Mindanao. In 2022, 92% of the region&#x27;s onion production was produced by the municipality of Miagao which targets to further increase production by expanding the plantation area.

Other crops produced by the municipality include eggplants, peanuts, monggo, tomatoes, root crops, and bamboo.

===Banks===
Miagao is a financial center in southern Iloilo. The town has a total of five banks.

==Infrastructure==
===Public Transport===
Miagao is strategically located along the Iloilo-Antique road. Because of this, transportation is not a big problem in the municipality.
The town proper is from Iloilo City and from San Jose de Buenavista, the capital of Antique.

====Buses====
Several bus companies operate in Miagao. Buses that ply the Iloilo-Antique, Iloilo-Caticlan via San Jose, and Iloilo-Manila routes pass by the municipality every day. Ceres Liner by Vallacar Transit passes by Miagao almost every 30 minutes on its way to Iloilo from Antique and vice versa.

Manila bound buses also pass by Miagao. Dimple Star Transport, Gasat/Valisno Transport, and Ceres Liner pass by Miagao every morning on their way to Manila. In addition, RM Liner also heads to Manila everyday but passes by Miagao early in the evening.

====Jeepneys====
Jeepneys serve the Miagao-Iloilo City route more frequently than buses. The typical jeepney can contain around 22 to as many as 34 or more passengers. The town is mainly served by Miagao-Iloilo City bound jeepneys but San Joaquin-Iloilo City bound jeepneys also serve the area. These jeepneys generally pass by every 10–20 minutes so catching a jeepney bound for Iloilo City is not a problem.
Several mountain barangays of Miagao are also served by jeepneys because smaller modes of transportation aren&#x27;t usually strong enough to climb steep and unpaved roads. In that case, habal-habal or plain motorcycles can also be used.

Jeepneys serving the hinterlands of the municipality include regular routes from the poblacion area to the following barangays:
*Miagao - Tiglawa/Banga via Banbanan/Cavite
*Miagao - San Jose via Banbanan
*Miagao - Tigmarabo via Banbanan/Oya-oy
*Miagao - Tig-amaga/Pudpud via Ticdalan
*Miagao - Tigmalapad/Igbita
*Miagao - Bacolod (barangay)
*Miagao - Dalije via Bacolod
*Miagao - Alimodias via Olango/Bacolod (rainy season) or via Pudpud (dry season)
*Miagao - Tigbagacay/Naclub
*Miagao - Maricolcol/Baraclayan

====Tricycles====
Tricycles are the most common form transportation in the municipality. These are the Philippines&#x27; version of tuk-tuk in other Asian countries. Tricycles are often limited to operate within the municipality but special and private trips to other places are allowed.
Miagao has established several tricycle routes in the municipality. Tricycles are color-coded to indicate the route assigned to them. Yellow ones are northbound while blue ones are southbound. Green tricycles are bound to the mountain barangays of the town passing through barangay Mat-y. Tricycles assigned to operate within the town proper are colored red.

==Highlights==

===Miag-ao Church===

The Miagao Church, or the Church of Santo Tomas de Villanueva, was built in 1786 by Spanish Augustinian missionaries and was declared as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Baroque Churches of the Philippines&quot; in 1993. On the front facade, which is flanked by two watchtower belfries, one can see the unique blending of Spanish and native influences.

The central feature of the bas-relief facade is a large coconut tree which reaches almost to the apex. While an integral part of the Philippine landscape, the coconut tree is also the subject of lore. According to an old Philippine legend, the coconut tree was the only bequest from a loving mother to her two children, a tree which sustained them for life. On the church&#x27;s facade the coconut tree appears as the &quot;tree of life&quot; to which St. Christopher carrying the Child Jesus on his shoulder is clinging to. The lesser facades feature the daily life of Miagaowanons during the time. Also depicted are other native flora and fauna, as well as native dress.

The church and its watchtowers were also built to defend the town and its people against raids by the Moro people. It therefore has thick walls and, reportedly, secret passages. Indeed, stretching along the Iloilo coast are defensive towers, but none that equal the size of the Miagao. It is because of this defensive purpose that it is sometimes referred to as the Miag-ao Fortress Church.

==Education==

The primary and secondary education in the municipality of Miagao is under the jurisdiction of the Division of Iloilo under the Department of Education Region 6. Miagao is subdivided into two school districts namely, Miagao East and Miagao West.

===Colleges and Universities===

;University of the Philippines Visayas

The Miagao campus of the University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) spreads out over 12 km2 on the outskirts of the town proper. This is the main campus of UPV which is composed of the UPV College of Management (CM) in Iloilo City, UPV High School in Iloilo (UPVHSI) in Iloilo City, UPV College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), UPV School of Technology (SoTech), and the flagship college of this campus, the UPV College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS) which focuses on marine science, aquaculture, fish processing, natural products development, and post-harvest/food science. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Thailand and Cambodia sent exchange students to the school to study fish and rice production, and after graduating returned home where they began out-producing and out-exporting the Philippines in these commodities.

;Iloilo Science and Technology University - Miagao Campus

The Iloilo Science and Technology University - Miagao Campus (formerly Southern Iloilo Polytechnic College) is one of the tertiary institutions in the municipality. The college started as Miagao Regional High School in 1945 and became the Miagao Vocational School in 1958. In 1984, Miagao Vocational School was converted to Southern Iloilo Polytechnic College (SIPC) to meet the demands of the changing times and for expansion purposes. SIPC was then integrated to Western Visayas College of Science and Technology (now Iloilo Science and Technology University) on November 24, 2000, by virtue of the Republic Act(RA) No. 7722, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Act of 1994 and RA No. 8292&quot;. Currently, the school offers courses in the fields of electronics and technology, hospitality, and primary and secondary education.

<doc id="534537" wikidata="Q740725" url="?curid=534537" title="Assembly of the Poor">
<text>The Assembly of the Poor () (AOP) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Thailand. Its aim is to help those affected by development projects and industries to become involved in the process of development, so that they benefit from those projects.

The Assembly of the Poor is intended to be a political voice for villagers and marginalized members of society. As an organization, it is allied with other NGOs in Thailand. When the Assembly of the Poor first began, it was accused of dismantling Thailand&#x27;s unity and the democratic principles of Thai ideologies. The non-governmental organization is an amalgamation of seven districts representing every region of Thailand. It is composed of urban and rural small-scale agriculturists and manual labourers. Due to its variety of members, the Assembly is able to transcend regional and class divisions.

==Background==
In the 1950s, Thailand underwent a plan of development, supported by the World Bank, intended to help the country industrialize. Subsequent foreign investment in the company&#x27;s economy assisted it towards meeting its goals, but while it would by the 1990s be considered a leader among developing nations along with other Southeast Asian countries, development was uneven through the country, with unequal distribution of wealth and technology. The agricultural community, which had sacrificed natural resources and contributed significant capital to the development of infrastructure saw few gains for themselves.

==Formation==
The Assembly of the Poor grew out of this unrest, beginning with villagers angry about the local impact of the Pak Mun Dam. One of the co-founders of the group, Vanida Tantiwittayapitak had become involved in Pak Mun after her relocation to the country following the Thammasat University massacre. While it started as a rural assembly, city workers were also welcomed.

The grassroots organization became official on international Human Rights Day, 10 December 1995, becoming the first rural political voice after the 1975 suppression of the Peasants&#x27; Federation. This took place on the opening day of their first conference, &quot;Assembly of the Poor: The consequences of Large-Scale Development Projects&quot;, held at Thammasat University and intended to coincide with the ASEAN Summit scheduled in Bangkok on 14–15 December.

Conference attendees spent several days developing the &quot;Mun River Declaration&quot;, which both announced their existence and criticized the prioritization of industrial development at the expense of local communities. It also fired a warning shot across the bow of government, forming a petition detailing their grievances to the government, punctuated by a march through Bangkok of hundreds of AOP members and sympathizers.

==Goals==
The Assembly of the Poor&#x27;s first strategy connected the issues suffered by local communities to national policy. Their second was to create a sense of shared identity among those who identified themselves as suffering from developmental policies or being excluded from developmental benefits. AOP demands compensation for those injured by developmental strategies and access to resources by their own communities, but does not limit its political activities to self-interest.

==Challenges==

According to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; the recent issues in Thailand have a lot to do with the political actors trying to undermine the AOP. The lack of unity among the poor poses a major obstacle in the battle for a more democratic society. In the 21st century, political divisions in Thailand have weakened the movement. In order for the NGO to continue in a positive direction the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; stated they must focus on:
#Natural resources
#Protection of local people&#x27;s rights to manage those resources
#The movement of certain issues to the forefront of their political voice.
#Community rights
#An aggressive tax rate on land holdings
#Establishment of a land development fund
#Fair land distribution

<text>The Seven Dials Mystery is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by William Collins &amp; Sons on 24 January 1929 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year.

In this novel, Christie brings back the characters from an earlier novel, &quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot;: Lady Eileen (Bundle) Brent, Lord Caterham, Bill Eversleigh, George Lomax, Tredwell, and Superintendent Battle.

The novel received mostly unfavourable reviews. One reviewer noted a change in style (&quot;Less good in point of style&quot;) but felt the novel &quot;maintains the author&#x27;s reputation of ingenuity.&quot; Another was quite disappointed in the change in style from some of her earlier novels, saying that she had &quot;deserted the methodical procedure of inquiry into a single and circumscribed crime for the romance of universal conspiracy and international rogues.&quot; Another felt that the story started out well, but then earned sharp criticism for the author as &quot;she has carefully avoided leaving any clues pointing to the real criminal. Worst of all, the solution itself is utterly preposterous.&quot; In 1990, this novel was considered to have the same characters and house parties as &quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot; &quot;but without the same verve and cheek.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Sir Oswald and Lady Coote host a party at the stately home Chimneys, which they have rented for the season. The guest list includes Gerry Wade, Jimmy Thesiger, Ronny Devereux, Bill Eversleigh, and Rupert &quot;Pongo&quot; Bateman. Since Wade has a bad habit of oversleeping, the others play a joke on him by placing eight alarm clocks in his room and timing them to go off at intervals. The next morning, a footman finds Wade dead in his bed, with chloral on his nightstand. Thesiger notices that one of the eight alarm clocks is missing. It is later found in a hedge.

Lord Caterham and his daughter Lady Eileen “Bundle” Brent move back into Chimneys. When Bundle drives to London to see Eversleigh, Ronny Devereux jumps out in front of her car. Before he dies, Devereux mutters &quot;Seven Dials...&quot; and &quot;Tell...Jimmy Thesiger.&quot; Bundle gets his body to a doctor, who tells her that her car did not hit Devereux; he was shot.

Seven Dials turns out to be a seedy nightclub and gambling den in the Seven Dials area of London. Bundle recognizes the doorman as Alfred, a footman from Chimneys. Alfred tells her that he left Chimneys for far higher wages offered by Mosgorovsky, owner of the club. Alfred takes Bundle into a secret room, where she hides in a cupboard and witnesses a meeting of six people wearing hoods with clock faces. They talk of the always-missing &quot;Number Seven&quot;, and about an upcoming party at Wyvern Abbey, where a scientist called Eberhard will offer a secret formula for sale to the British Air Minister.

At the party, the formula is stolen, but retrieved by Wade&#x27;s sister, and Jimmy Thesiger is shot in his right arm. Thesiger tells how he fought a man who climbed down the ivy. The next morning, Battle finds a charred left-handed glove with teeth marks in the fireplace. He theorizes that the thief threw the gun onto the lawn from the terrace and then climbed back into the house via the ivy. Bundle’s father reports that Bauer, the footman who replaced Alfred, is missing.

Thesiger rings up Bundle and Gerry Wade&#x27;s sister Loraine and tells them to meet him and Eversleigh at the Seven Dials club. Bundle shows Thesiger the room where the Seven Dials meet. Loraine finds Eversleigh unconscious in the car and they take him into the club. Thesiger says that he will go for a doctor.

Someone knocks Bundle unconscious and she comes round in Eversleigh&#x27;s arms. Mr Mosgorovsky takes them into the meeting of the Seven Dials, where Number Seven is revealed as Superintendent Battle. He reveals that they are a group of people doing secret service work for the government. Battle tells Bundle that the association has succeeded with their main target, an international criminal whose stock in trade is the theft of secret formulae: Jimmy Thesiger was arrested that afternoon with his accomplice, Loraine Wade. Battle explains that Thesiger killed Wade and Devereux when they got onto his track. Devereux took the eighth clock from Wade&#x27;s room to see if anyone reacted to there being &quot;seven dials&quot;. At Wyvern Abbey, Thesiger stole the formula, passed it to Loraine, then shot himself in his right arm and disposed of his left-hand glove using his teeth. Eversleigh feigned unconsciousness in the car outside the Seven Dials club. Thesiger never went for a doctor, but hid in the club, and knocked Bundle unconscious. Bundle takes Wade&#x27;s place in the Seven Dials and marries Bill Eversleigh.

==Literary significance and reception==

The review in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; issue of 4 April 1929 was for once markedly unenthusiastic about a Christie Book: &quot;It is a great pity that Mrs Christie should in this, as in a previous book, have deserted the methodical procedure of inquiry into a single and circumscribed crime for the romance of universal conspiracy and international rogues. These Gothic romances are not to be despised but they are so different in kind from the story of strict detection that it is unlikely for anyone to be adept in both. Mrs Christie lacks the haphazard and credulous romanticism which makes the larger canvas of more extensive crime successful. In such a performance bravura rather than precision is essential. The mystery of Seven Dials and of the secret society which met in that sinister district requires precisely such a broad treatment, but Mrs Christie gives to it that minute study which she employed so skilfully in her earlier books.&quot; The review concluded, &quot;There is no particular reason why the masked man should be the particular person he turns out to be&quot;.

The review in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 7 April 1929 began &quot;After reading the opening chapters of this book one anticipates an unusually entertaining yarn. There are some very jolly young people in it, and the fact that they become involved in a murder mystery does not dampen their spirits to any great extent.&quot; The uncredited reviewer set up the plot regarding Gerald Wade being found dead and then said, &quot;Thus far the story is excellent; indeed it continues to promise well until the time comes when the mystery is to be solved. Then it is seen that the author has been so keen on preventing the reader from guessing the solution that she has rather overstepped the bounds of what should be permitted to a writer of detective stories. She has held out information which the reader should have had, and, not content with scattering false clues with a lavish hand, she has carefully avoided leaving any clues pointing to the real criminal. Worst of all, the solution itself is utterly preposterous. This book is far below the standard set by Agatha Christie&#x27;s earlier stories.&quot;

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; of 28 January 1929 said, &quot;Less good in point of style than some of her earlier novels, The Seven Dials Mystery…maintains the author&#x27;s reputation of ingenuity.&quot; The review went on to say that, &quot;It is an unusual feature of this story that at the end, the reader will want to go back over the story to see if he has had a square deal from the author. On the whole he has.&quot;

Robert Barnard noted that this novel had the &quot;Same characters and setting with &quot;Chimneys&quot;&quot; and then concluded his view of it by adding &quot;but without the same verve and cheek.&quot;

In her autobiography, Christie states that this book was what she called “the light-hearted thriller type”. She went on to say that they were always easy to write as they didn’t require too much plotting or planning, presumably in contrast to the very-tightly planned detective stories. She called this era her “plutocratic” period in that she was starting to receive sums for American serialisation rights which both exceeded what she earned in the UK for such rights and was, at this time, free of income tax. She compared this period favourably with the time at which she wrote these comments (1950s to 1960s) when she was plagued with income tax problems which lasted for some twenty years and ate up most of what people presumed was a large fortune.

The book entered the public domain in the US on January 1st 2025.

===Dustjacket blurb===

The blurb of the first edition (which is carried on both the back of the dustjacket and opposite the title page) reads:
When Gerald Wade died, apparently from an overdose of sleeping draught, seven clocks appeared on the mantelpiece. Who put them there and had they any connection with the Night Club in Seven Dials? That is the mystery that Bill Eversleigh and Bundle and two other young people set out to investigate. Their investigations lead them into some queer places and more than once into considerable danger. Not till the very end of the book is the identity of the mysterious Seven o’clock revealed.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
===1981===
Following the success of their version of &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t They Ask Evans&quot; in 1980, &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery&quot; was adapted by London Weekend Television as a 140-minute television film and transmitted on Sunday 8 March 1981. The same team of Pat Sandys, Tony Wharmby and Jack Williams worked on the production which again starred John Gielgud and James Warwick. Cheryl Campbell also starred as &quot;Bundle&quot; Brent. The production was extremely faithful to the book with no major deviations to the plot or characters.

This second success of adapting an Agatha Christie book led to the same company commissioning &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; and &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Partners in Crime&quot; for their 1983 transmission.

The production was first screened on US television as part of &quot;Mobil Showcase&quot; in April 1981.

<text>Felix Oscar Schlag (September 4, 1891 – March 9, 1974) was a German born American sculptor who was the designer of the United States five cent coin in use from 1938 to 2004.

He was born to Karl and Teresa Schlag in Frankfurt, Germany where as a young man, he served in the German army of World War I. Schlag studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He moved to the United States in 1929.

On April 21, 1938, Schlag&#x27;s design for the Jefferson nickel was selected by Nellie Tayloe Ross, Director of the United States Mint. Schlag won $1,000 for his winning design of the coin; he had been an award-winning artist in Europe. His prize money was spent on his wife&#x27;s funeral. In the 1930s, Felix won several sculptural commissions and art prizes including some New Deal commissions to produce work at several post offices, including ones in White Hall, Illinois and schools in Champaign, Illinois and Bloom Township.

Schlag accepted the offer of the American government to place his initials, FS, on the nickel beginning in 1966.

The designer relocated to Owosso, Michigan, where he died and is buried. He and his wife Anna, whom he married in 1920, had three children: Feliza (1920), Leo (1921), and Hilda (1929). A memorial was placed by the Michigan State Numismatic Society on September 14, 2008.

<doc id="534565" wikidata="Q2372144" url="?curid=534565" title="Social Democratic Party of Russia (2001)">
<text>The Social Democratic Party of Russia (SDPR; ; &quot;Sotsial-demokraticheskaya partiya Rossii&quot;, &quot;SDPR&quot;) was a political party founded in Russia by Mikhail Gorbachev on November 26, 2001. The first name of the party was Social Democratic Party of Russia (United).

==History==
The Social Democratic Party of Russia was a coalition of several social democratic parties, had approximately 12,000 members, but had no seats in the Russian State Duma. Gorbachev resigned as party leader in May 2004 over a disagreement with party chairman Konstantin Titov who had insisted, over Gorbachev&#x27;s opposition, on a deal with the pro-Kremlin United Russia Party in the previous year&#x27;s general election.

Konstantin Titov, in turn, announced his resignation at the 3rd convention of the party held September 4, 2004. The convention elected the new chairman, Vladimir Kishenin, leader of the Party of Social Justice, who was favoured by Titov.

Presenting himself, Kishenin mentioned that he studied in a KGB college in 1972-1975. When asked why he was a trusted representative for Vladimir Putin during the last presidential election, Kishenin explained that this was done at the request of Vladislav Surkov, deputy director of the President&#x27;s Administration.

<doc id="534579" wikidata="Q1054483" url="?curid=534579" title="Century City">
<text>Century City is a 176-acre (71.2 ha) neighborhood and business district in Los Angeles, California, United States. Located on the Westside to the south of Santa Monica Boulevard around 10 miles (16 km) west of downtown Los Angeles, Century City is one of the most prominent employment centers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and its skyscrapers form a distinctive skyline on the city&#x27;s westside.

The district was developed on the former backlot of film studio 20th Century Studios, and its first building was opened in 1963. Important to the economy are the Westfield Century City shopping center, business towers, and the Fox Studio Lot.

==History==

The land of Century City belonged to cowboy actor Tom Mix (1880-1940), who used it as a ranch. It later became a backlot of the former 20th Century Fox, which has since divided to become 20th Century Studios, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, and Fox Corporation, which has its headquarters just to the southwest. The area is named for 20th Century Pictures, which merged with Fox Film Corporation, in 1935.

In 1956, Spyros Skouras (1893-1971), who served as the President of the former 20th Century Fox from 1942 until 1962, and his nephew-in-law Edmond Herrscher (died 1983), an attorney sometimes known as &quot;the father of Century City&quot;, decided to repurpose the land for real estate development. The following year, in 1957, they commissioned a master-plan development from Welton Becket Associates, which was unveiled at a major press event on the &quot;western&quot; backlot later that year.

In 1961, after Fox suffered a string of expensive flops, culminating with the financial strain put on the studio by the very expensive production of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, the film studio sold about to developer William Zeckendorf and Aluminum Co. of America, also known as Alcoa, for US$54 million (US$533 million in 2023 money) who had plans for a $300 million (3 billion 2023) development. Herrscher had encouraged his uncle-in-law to borrow money instead, but once Skouras refused, he was out of the picture.

The new owners conceived Century City as &quot;a city within a city&quot;. 
In 1963, the first building, Gateway West Building, was completed. The next year, in 1964, Minoru Yamasaki designed the Century Plaza Hotel. Five years later, in 1969, architects Anthony J. Lumsden and César Pelli designed the Century City Medical Plaza.

==Geography==
According to the City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning, Century City constitutes census tract 2679.01.

Century City is generally bounded by Santa Monica Boulevard to the north, the city of Beverly Hills to the east, Pico Boulevard to the south, and Century Park West to the west (including the west side of Century Park West between Santa Monica Boulevard and Constellation Boulevard). These boundaries correspond with those recognized by the Century City Business Improvement District Association.

Neighboring Century City are Beverly Hills to the east, Cheviot Hills to the south, West Los Angeles to the west, and Westwood to the north.

===Mapping L.A.===
The Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; extends Century City&#x27;s western boundary to Beverly Glen Boulevard. However, this more expansive definition is not consistent with other &quot;L.A. Times&quot; reports: a 1999 article sets Century Park West as Century City&#x27;s western boundary, and a 2017 article refers to the neighborhood to the west of Century City (between Century Park West and Beverly Glen Boulevard) as distinct from it.

===Climate===
==Demographics==

Century City makes up census tract 2679.01, which is 0.4 square miles. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 2,428 residents and 1,812 housing units, for an average of 1.34 persons per household.

The 2017 American Community Survey estimated a population of 2,235 in Century City, or 5,170.1 people per square mile, and 1,929 housing units. Per capita income was $148,638 and median household income was $123,889.

===Mapping L.A. data===
The following data apply to Century City within the boundaries set by Mapping L.A.:

In 2008, the median age for residents was 46, older than average for the city and the county. The percentage of residents aged 65 and older (26.4%) was the highest for any neighborhood in Los Angeles County. The percentages of widowed men and women and of divorced men were among the county&#x27;s highest. Military veterans accounted for 11.9% of the population, a high rate for the city and the county.

The breakdown was whites, 82.5%; Asians, 8.6%; Latinos, 4.4%; blacks, 1.4%; and others, 3,0%. Iran (21.2%) and Canada (6.1%) were the most common places of birth for the 25.5% of the residents who were born abroad—a low percentage, compared to the city at large.

The median yearly income in 2014 was $95,135, a high figure for Los Angeles. The percentage of households that earned $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 1.8 people was low for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 39.6% of the housing stock and apartment owners held 60.4%.

==Economy==
Westfield Century City and Fox Studios occupy important acreage in the neighborhood. Westfield Century City underwent an $800 million renovation and expansion aiming to maintain the center&#x27;s status as one of the Westside&#x27;s premier shopping and entertainment destinations.

One tower, Constellation Place (formerly the MGM Tower), has the headquarters of Houlihan Lokey, ICM Partners, and International Lease Finance Corporation. Crystal Cruises is also headquartered in Century City along with haircare manufacturer, John Paul Mitchell Systems.

==Government and infrastructure==

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Century City.

Los Angeles Fire Department Station 92 is the assigned fire station for the district. The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station at 1663 Butler Avenue, 90025, serving the neighborhood.

Santa Monica Airport is nearby. Major roads including Santa Monica Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), and the San Diego Freeway (I-405) are all located next to Century City. Olympic Boulevard goes through Century City.

Phase II of the D Line Extension, set to open in 2026, will add a subway stop (Century City/Constellation) on the D Line at the intersection of Avenue of the Stars and Constellation Boulevard, in the heart of Century City.

==Education==

Fifty-five percent of Century City residents aged 25 or over had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high figure for Los Angeles.

Los Angeles Unified School District is the school district of Century City.

Three private schools are located in or near Century City  — VINCI Academy Daycare &amp; Preschool, at 1940 Century Park East; Lycée Français de Los Angeles, at 10361 Pico Boulevard; and Temple Isaiah Preschool and Kindergarten, at 10345 West Pico Boulevard.

There are also two public schools located near Century City in Westwood- Westwood Charter Elementary School and Emerson Community Charter Middle School. These are both schools part of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

<doc id="534587" wikidata="Q3273477" url="?curid=534587" title="Ma and Pa Kettle">
<text>Ma and Pa Kettle are comic film characters of the successful film series of the same name, produced by Universal Studios, in the late 1940s and 1950s. “The hillbilly duo have their hands full with a ramshackle farm and a brood of rambunctious children. When the future comes a-callin&#x27; in the form of modern houses, exotic locales, and newfangled ideas, Ma and Pa must learn how to make the best of it with luck, pluck, and a little country charm.”

Originally based on real-life farming neighbors in Washington state, United States, Ma and Pa Kettle were composite characters created by Betty MacDonald in whose 1945 best-selling, semi-fictional memoir, &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, they appeared. The success of the novel spawned the 1947 film &quot;The Egg and I&quot; starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray, also co-starring Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride as Ma and Pa Kettle. Main was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role.

After the audiences&#x27; positive reaction to the Kettles in the film, Universal Studios produced nine more films, with Marjorie Main reprising her role in all and Percy Kilbride reprising his in seven. The films grossed an estimated $35 million altogether at the box office and are said to have saved Universal from bankruptcy.

==Premise==
*Phoebe &quot;Ma&quot; Kettle (played by Marjorie Main in all 10 films) is a raucous, hardworking country woman with a robust figure. She is smarter than Pa, but not by much, and can easily be fooled. (In the book, she is earthier and more profane. When she was a newly immigrated Baltic teenager, she married Pa under the impression that since he owned a farm, he was a solid prospect.) Ma is content with her role as mother to 15 rambunctious, mischievous children on their ramshackle farm in rural Cape Flattery, Washington. Because she has so many children, Ma sometimes gets their names confused. A misspelled sign &quot;Be-ware of childrun&quot; is posted in front of the farmhouse to warn unwanted visitors of hurled rocks, projectiles from slingshots and pea shooters, and other missiles launched by the rowdy and unpredictable Kettle brood.
*Franklin &quot;Pa&quot; Kettle (played by Percy Kilbride in the first eight films and by Parker Fennelly in the last film) is a gentle, slow-speaking, slow-thinking, and lazy man. His only talents appear to be avoiding work and winning contests. In the second film of the series, the family moves into a modern home with numerous electronic gadgets won by Pa in a tobacco slogan-writing contest. As the series continued, various reasons were devised to have the family relocate to the &quot;old place&quot;, sometimes for extended periods of time. Much of the comedy is cornball humor arising from preposterous situations, such as Pa masquerading as a wealthy industrialist (&quot;P.A. Kettle&quot; in &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot;, 1955) or being jailed after he accidentally causes racehorses to eat feed laced with concrete (&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair&quot;, 1952). He has a younger brother, Sedgewick Kettle (played by Arthur Hunnicutt in the ninth film), who owns their parents&#x27; farm in Mournful Hollow, Arkansas.

==Recurring characters in the series==
*Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Kettle is the eldest of the Kettle children and is portrayed by Richard Long in the first four films. Tom works hard and goes to college at Washington State University, studying animal husbandry. He designs an improved chicken incubator. He meets his future wife, Kim, in a train ride back to Cape Flattery, but due to work issues, the two relocate to New York City.
*Kimberly &quot;Kim&quot; Kettle (née Parker) is the wife of Tom Kettle and is portrayed by Meg Randall in three films. She was the reporter for a popular Seattle magazine and came to Cape Flattery to write a series of articles on the Kettles and their new model home. Kim is very fond of the Kettles.
*Birdie Hicks is the Kettles&#x27; aging, cantankerous archenemy and is portrayed by Esther Dale in four films. She usually rides around in either her Model T car or her horse-drawn buggy with her elderly mother, lamenting Pa&#x27;s laziness and the family&#x27;s lack of organization. Birdie frequently competes with Ma whenever there is a quilting or jam contest at the county fair. In a rare act of kindness, she gives Ma and Pa the prize money she won at a horse race so Rosie can go to college. Apparently, her mother, Mrs. Hicks or Mother Hicks (played by Isabel O&#x27;Madigan in two films and by Hallene Hill in one), sympathizes with the Kettles.
*Billy Reed is the town&#x27;s local merchant, portrayed by Billy House in the first film (1947), and then by Emory Parnell in four films (1949–1954). While he&#x27;s a traveling salesman in &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, by the later Kettle movies, Billy has a general store in downtown Cape Flattery where his motto is written: &quot;If there&#x27;s anything you need, just come in and see Billy Reed.&quot; He often stops at the Kettle place to visit or deliver merchandise.
*Rosie Kettle is the Kettles&#x27; second-eldest daughter portrayed by Gloria Moore in one and Lori Nelson in two films. She desires to go to Sheraton College, but is unable to do so because of the family&#x27;s economic instability. She is later learned to be working in Seattle. Rosie travels to Waikiki with Ma and Pa to help with cousin Rodney&#x27;s pineapple enterprise.
*Jonathan and Elizabeth Parker are Kim Kettle&#x27;s parents portrayed by Ray Collins and Barbara Brown in two films. They travel from Boston to see Tom and Kim&#x27;s newborn baby in the fourth film. Elizabeth does not get along with the Kettles at first, but over time, realizes her mistake; Jonathan enjoys being with them from the start. The Parkers invite Ma and Pa to a trip to Paris in the sixth film.
*Geoduck (Oliver Blake) and Crowbar (Teddy Hart or Stan Ross) are Pa&#x27;s Native American friends and usually act as his handymen, doing various tasks around the house under Pa&#x27;s &quot;supervision.&quot; Geoduck, pronounced &quot;jaw-duck&quot; in &quot;The Egg and I&quot; and then standardized as &quot;gear-duck&quot;, is the chief of their tribe.

==Kettle Kids==
&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; and &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town&quot; mention 15 kids (including Thomas and Rosie above), although inconsistency arises in the names
==Animals on the Kettles&#x27; farm==

Bossie is the Kettles&#x27; red and white milk cow, which provides Ma, Pa, and their family with plenty of milk. Most of the time, the older Kettle boys or even Pa&#x27;s Indian friends, Geoduck and Crowbar, milk her. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town&quot; (1950), Pa is seen milking Bossie while listening to the music playing on the radio.
The chickens are a flock of nearly 100 chickens kept by the Kettles on their broken-down farm, which provide them with many eggs each day. Sometimes, one or two of the hens cause mischief towards the Kettles or other characters in the films. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot; (1954), Ma Kettle&#x27;s prized speckled hen is seen a few times laying eggs on Mannering&#x27;s head or in his bowler hat.

Pa Kettle&#x27;s team includes an old, retired trotting horse, named Emma, and a white donkey wearing a straw hat, which together pull Pa&#x27;s wagon around the county. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair&quot; (1952), Pa buys Emma originally to win a horse race at the county fair.

Nick is the Kettles&#x27; prized black bull. He spends most of his time living on the Kettles&#x27; farm, which is his main home, but in &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;, he sneaks out of the farm and lumbers towards the Maddocks&#x27; farm to visit one of John Maddocks&#x27; prize cows, Bessie. He is often seen wearing a derby hat on his head, similar to the hat worn by Pa Kettle.

The goats are herd of four white Saanen goats that live on the Kettles&#x27; farm. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;, their original owner, John Maddocks, sells them to Pa Kettle for $100 (). The goats spend most of their time grazing around the farm, but the largest of them, a large billy with massive, curved horns, often causes everyone trouble. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;, he butts Ma, then Mannering, and lastly Pa, after they turn their backs to him. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm&quot;, he starts chewing on several sticks of dynamite which Pa bought to make a new well for Ma, but Pa keeps snatching them from him.

Agnes is the Kettles&#x27; family Bluetick Coonhound, which also lives on the farm. She is often seen wearing a sweater that Ma Kettle made for her. In &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;, she produces a litter of puppies for the Kettles and their friends at their Christmas Eve party.

==Kettle farm set==
The Kettle Farm (also known as Gausman Ranch, playfully named for set decorator Russell A. Gausman) was a movie ranch in Universal Studios, where most of the &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; features were filmed. The set was redressed several times to resemble a cluttered farmhouse with dilapidating farm buildings. The Kettles&#x27; farmhouse did not appear in &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation&quot; and &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot;. The farm buildings were restored and painted for &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;. The entire farm set was modified for &quot;The Kettles in the Ozarks&quot;, where it was reused as Uncle Sedge&#x27;s farm in Arkansas. The remodeled farmhouse was also used for &quot;The Kettles on Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm&quot;. Prior to the Kettle Farm area being demolished in 1969 to begin construction on the Gibson Amphitheatre, it was significantly altered for the filming of &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Today, this site is The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

The movie ranch appeared in other films and television series, including:

* &quot;The Thing That Couldn&#x27;t Die&quot; (1958)
* &quot;The Deputy&quot; (1959–1961)
* &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (9th season episode &quot;The Jar&quot;)
* &quot;Adam-12&quot; (1968–1975)

==Films==

The ten Kettle films are:
#&quot;The Egg and I&quot; (1947)
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; (1949) or &quot;The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle&quot;
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town&quot; (1950)
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm&quot; (1951)
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair&quot; (1952)
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation&quot; (1953)
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot; (1954)
#&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot; (1955)
#&quot;The Kettles in the Ozarks&quot; (1956)
#&quot;The Kettles on Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm&quot; (1957)

===&quot;The Egg and I&quot;===
Ma and Pa Kettle first appeared in supporting roles as neighbors in &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, starring Fred MacMurray and Claudette Colbert as a refined city couple who move to a rural chicken farm. Marjorie Main, a veteran character actress, played a hardy country woman in dozens of films, so was a natural for the role of Ma Kettle. Main was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

===&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; series===
After the success of &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride starred in their own series of Ma and Pa Kettle movies, which became box-office bonanzas for Universal Pictures, having earned an estimated $35 million for the entire series.

Universal insisted on releasing only one Kettle picture annually, during the spring months. Consequently there was a backlog of completed but unreleased films. &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Paris&quot; was ultimately released as &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation&quot;; &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Hit the Road Home&quot; became &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;. Kilbride retired after the latter film in 1953, primarily from boredom with the character, as well as health concerns. Kilbride&#x27;s farewell film was &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot;, filmed in February 1952 but finally released in 1955.

===&quot;The Kettles&quot; films===
In 1954 Universal assigned the &quot;Kettle&quot; producer, director, and writer to make a new rustic comedy with Main but without Kilbride, &quot;Ricochet Romance&quot;, while trying to persuade Kilbride to return to the series. When Kilbride refused, the studio kept the franchise going by dropping &quot;Pa Kettle&quot; from the film titles and referring to the series as &quot;The Kettles.&quot;

Arthur Hunnicutt played Pa&#x27;s brother Sedge Kettle in &quot;The Kettles in the Ozarks&quot; (1956). The next film brought back Pa Kettle in the person of Parker Fennelly, who had played homespun, laconic types on radio; &quot;The Kettles on Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm&quot; (1957) was not successful enough to prolong the series, but Universal kept the older films playing in theaters into the 1960s.

===Box office rankings===
At the height of the popularity of the series, exhibitors polled by Quigley Publishing voted Kilbride and Main among the most popular stars in the US:
*1951 - Marjorie Main alone 15th-most popular star
*1952 - Main and Kilbride 25th-most popular
*1953 - Main and Kilbride 13th-most popular
*1954 - Main and Kilbride 15th-most popular
*1955 - Main and Kilbride 25th-most popular

==Adaptations and revivals==

Betty MacDonald&#x27;s characters Ma and Pa Kettle also appeared in television&#x27;s first comedy serial, &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, which aired on CBS (September 3, 1951 – August 1, 1952). Each episode was only 15 minutes long. Ma Kettle was played by Doris Rich and Pa Kettle was played by Frank Twedell. Betty Lynn (better known as Barney Fife&#x27;s girlfriend Thelma Lou from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;) played Betty MacDonald in some episodes, including &quot;Pa Turns Over a New Leaf&quot; (which aired on May 21, 1952). The role was usually played by Pat Kirkland. Another episode, &quot;The Purloined Jacket&quot;, starred Mary Perry as Cammy, Richard Carlyle as Joe Kettle, and William A. Lee as Ed Peabody.

Animator Walter Lantz produced a short-lived cartoon series for Universal Pictures called &quot;Maw and Paw&quot;, although only four cartoons were released between 1953 and 1955. The characters Maw and Paw (voiced by Grace Stafford and Dal McKennon, respectively) were based on the characters of Ma and Pa Kettle. The spellings of Maw and Paw Kettle appeared in the book &quot;The Egg and I&quot; (1945). Another Walter Lantz cartoon, &quot;The Ostrich Egg And I&quot; (1956), from the Maggie &amp; Sam series, was a spoof of &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, with Maggie voiced by Grace Stafford and Sam voiced by Daws Butler.

In &quot;The Munsters&quot; season-one episode &quot;Family Portrait&quot; (S01 E13, 1964-12-17), a magazine writer makes a reference to the Kettles when he sees the Munster home, which he implies resembles the Kettle farmhouse: &quot;Let&#x27;s see if Ma and Pa Kettle are home.&quot;

In several Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1950s and 1960s, prolific voice artist June Foray imitates Marjorie Main&#x27;s voice whenever a big, aggressive female character appears in the cartoon. Many boomer kids became familiar with Foray&#x27;s version of Main&#x27;s voice before they discovered Marjorie Main as the source of Foray&#x27;s imitation.

The satirical film &quot;Loose Shoes&quot; (1980), which starred Bill Murray, included a sketch called &quot;A Visit With Ma and Pa&quot;, where Ma Kettle was played by Ysabel MacCloskey and Pa Kettle was played by Walker Edmiston.

<text>Beaton Tulk (May 22, 1944 – May 23, 2019) was a Canadian educator, civil servant and politician. He served as the seventh premier of Newfoundland from 2000 to 2001 as a member of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador. To date, he is the last premier of the province to be born in the British dependent territory of Newfoundland, before its accession to Canada as a province.

==Early life==
Born in Ladle Cove, Newfoundland, Tulk was the youngest son of Sadie and Japhet Tulk. He graduated from Memorial University with BA, B.Ed, and Master of Educational Administration degrees. He also later obtained a Canadian Securities Investment Diploma. An educator prior to politics, he was a supervising principal for the Carmanville school system from 1974 to 1979.

==Political career==
Tulk was first elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1979 as the Liberal Party of Newfoundland (later Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador) member for Fogo, and was re-elected in 1982 and 1985. He was defeated in the 1989 election; in 1990, he became the Assistant Deputy Minister of Children and Youth Services for the Newfoundland government. He was returned to the House of Assembly for Fogo in 1993. He was then elected in the newly redistributed riding of Bonavista North in 1996, and re-elected in 1999.

Tulk was appointed Minister of Forest Resources and Agrifoods in May 1997 and Minister of Development and Rural Renewal in July 1997. In December 1998, he stepped down from cabinet when he was the subject of allegations of wrongdoing by the owner of a private college. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by the police and by a commissioner&#x27;s report, and returned to the cabinet in April 1999. He was appointed Deputy Premier in August 2000 and Premier of Newfoundland in October 2000 when his predecessor, Brian Tobin, returned to federal politics. He was not a candidate in the race to succeed Tobin as Liberal leader and returned to the position of Deputy Premier in February 2001 when Roger Grimes was elected Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier.

In 2002, Tulk resigned his provincial seat to run unsuccessfully for the federal Liberals for the House of Commons of Canada seat of Gander—Grand Falls in a by-election after George Baker was appointed to the Senate, but was defeated by Rex Barnes. Tulk then tried to return to provincial politics, running in the provincial by-election resulting from his own resignation, but was defeated by Harry Harding.

On December 16, 2002, Tulk was appointed by the federal government of Jean Chrétien to the Canadian Transportation Agency.

==Later life==
In 2018, Flanker Press released his autobiography, &quot;A Man of My Word&quot;, co-written by Laurie Blackwood Pike. He lived in Musgravetown with his wife Dora during his final years.

Tulk died from prostate cancer on May 23, 2019, one day after his 75th birthday. He was diagnosed with the illness 15 years prior to his death. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau praised Tulk&#x27;s career of &quot;putting people first&quot;, and cited his death as a &quot;loss of a great Canadian and a great Liberal&quot;.

<text>Erik Belton Evers Bruhn (3 October 1928 – 1 April 1986) was a Danish ballet dancer, choreographer, artistic director, actor, and author.

==Early life==
Erik Bruhn was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, the fourth child and first son of Ellen (née Evers), owner of a hairdressing salon, and third child of Ernst Bruhn. His parents married shortly before his birth. Bruhn began training with the Royal Danish Ballet when he was nine years old, and made his unofficial début on the stage of Copenhagen&#x27;s Royal Opera House in 1946, dancing the role of Adonis in Harald Lander&#x27;s ballet &quot;Thorvaldsen.&quot;

==Career==
He was taken permanently into the company in 1947 at the age of eighteen. Bruhn took the first of his frequent sabbaticals from the Danish company in 1947, dancing for six months with the short-lived Metropolitan Ballet in England, where he formed his first major partnership, with the Bulgarian ballerina Sonia Arova. He returned to the Royal Danish Ballet in the spring of 1948 and was promoted to soloist in 1949, the highest level a dancer can attain in the Danish ballet. Later in 1949, he again took a leave of absence and joined American Ballet Theatre in New York City, where he would dance regularly for the next nine years, although his home company continued to be the Royal Danish Ballet.

The turning point in Bruhn&#x27;s international career came on 1 May 1955 with his début in the role of Albrecht in &quot;Giselle&quot; partnering Dame Alicia Markova, nearly twenty years his senior, in a with Ballet Theatre in New York after only three days of rehearsal. The performance caused a sensation. Dance critic John Martin, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a date to write down in the history books, for it was as if the greatest Giselle of today were handing over a sacred trust to what is probably the greatest Albrecht of tomorrow.&quot; In an article entitled &quot;The Matinée that Made History&quot; in &quot;Dance News&quot; in June 1955, P. W. Manchester wrote:
Technically exacting as it is, the role of Albrecht is not beyond the capabilities of any competent premier danseur, and Erik Bruhn is infinitely more than that; he is probably the most completely equipped male dancer of the day, with the flawlessly clean technique that comes only through a combination of enormous talent allied to correct day-by-day training from childhood ... If his dancing was magnificent, and it was, his partnering of and playing to Markova were no less so. The result was one of those electrifying performances when everyone both in the audience and on the stage is aware that something extraordinary is happening.
Bruhn formally resigned from the Danish ballet in 1961, by which time he had become internationally known as a phenomenon, although he continued to dance periodically with the company as a guest artist. In May 1961, he returned to Ballet Theatre for its New York season. In its 5 May issue, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a major article on the dancer and his art:
Back home Bruhn, 32, is the idol of the Royal Danish Ballet, where he has brought new life to the classic roles reserved for a premier danseur noble. His technical credentials include a fine dramatic sense and an ability to leap with a high-arching grace, to turn with cat quickness and fluidity on the ground or in midair, to project emotion with vivid movements of arms, legs and body. But Bruhn long ago became aware that &quot;technique is not enough,&quot; and he is remarkable for the feeling of tension he can convey by his mere presence. Poised and trim (5 ft. 7 in., 140 lbs.), he somehow rivets an audience with the promise of action before he has danced a step ... As Bruhn soars ever closer to his apogee, he spends restless nights reviewing roles in his mind. He has surprisingly little of the vanity that goads most performers; he does not want audiences to pay, he says, &quot;only to see me jump.&quot; Furthermore, he would rather &quot;be bad in a good ballet than be great in a bad ballet.&quot; But to be great in a good ballet? To do it, says Erik Bruhn, &quot;it is important, even if you performed a role the night before, to think, &#x27;This is the first time this is going to happen.&#x27; &quot;
During the next 10 years, Bruhn formed long relationships as a guest artist not only with Ballet Theatre but with most all of the major ballet companies in Europe and North America, including the New York City Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada, the Paris Opera Ballet, and London&#x27;s Royal Ballet. He was best known for his lead roles in &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, &quot;Giselle&quot;, Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. John Cranko made &quot;Daphnis and Chlöe&quot; on him in 1962 at the Stuttgart Ballet, which Bruhn considered his favorite from amongst the ballets created specifically for him. He was also acclaimed in dramatic roles, such as Jean in Birgit Cullberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, the Moor in José Limón&#x27;s &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Pavane&quot;, and Don José in Roland Petit&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. In addition to Sonia Arova, Bruhn had significant dance partnerships with a large and unusually varied number of ballerinas: the Americans Cynthia Gregory, Nora Kaye, Allegra Kent, and Maria Tallchief; the Russian Natalia Makarova; the Dane Kirstin Simone; the British Nadia Nerina; and, most famously, with the Italian Carla Fracci.

In his book, &quot;Beyond Technique&quot; (1968), Bruhn discussed his thoughts on partnering:

It has been noticed that I have been able to work with many different kinds of ballerinas, and on most occasions we succeeded in becoming a team if only for a season or two. And that is because I always wanted to relate to them. I don&#x27;t remain the same. Each ballerina is different; she has a special flavor or she wouldn&#x27;t be a ballerina. This would color my style and shape my approach. I remain true to myself, but I let her flavor color me as mine colors her ... A good partnership can somehow crystallize something that you have been doing already. When the right people come together, they bring the right thing out of each other ... With the right person, it becomes a situation of being rather than playing ...The role absorbs you and you become it. And then it seems like you can do nothing wrong because you are so totally absorbed by this being.
==Awards and retirement==

Bruhn was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, one of Denmark&#x27;s highest honors, in 1963, the same year he was awarded the Nijinsky Prize in Paris. After retiring as a &quot;danseur noble&quot; in 1972, Bruhn danced character roles, such as Madge the Witch in &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, Dr. Coppelius, and &quot;Petrushka&quot;. He was director of the Swedish Opera Ballet from 1967 to 1973 and the National Ballet of Canada from 1983 until his death in 1986. Although twice offered the directorship of the Royal Danish Ballet, he twice declined the post. His productions of full-length classical ballets, such as &quot;La Sylphide&quot;,&quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Coppélia&quot;, and his somewhat controversial &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for the National Ballet of Canada, were well received, as were his stagings of pas de deux from the Bournonville repertoire. A superb teacher and coach, Bruhn was dedicated to imparting purity of form and dance as drama not spectacle. He believed in &quot;complete identification&quot; with the character being portrayed, &quot;but under complete control. Because if you lose yourself completely, you cannot communicate.&quot; In 1974, he played a leading role in the stage play &quot;Rashomon&quot; with Susse Wold in Denmark, for which he won acclaim.

==Personal life==
Bruhn met Rudolf Nureyev, the celebrated Russian dancer, after Nureyev defected to the West in 1961. Nureyev was a great admirer of Bruhn, having seen filmed performances of the Dane on tour in Russia with the American Ballet Theatre, although stylistically the two dancers were very different. Bruhn became the great love of Nureyev&#x27;s life and the two remained close for 25 years, until Bruhn&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Bruhn died in Toronto General Hospital on 1 April 1986 at the age of 57. His death was attributed to lung cancer. However, according to Pierre-Henri Verlhac, he might have died of AIDS. He is buried in an unmarked grave at Mariebjerg Cemetery in Gentofte, an affluent northern suburb of Copenhagen, near the house where he grew up.

Dance critic John Rockwell, in his obituary of Bruhn, noted:
Mr. Bruhn was valued more as an epitome of manly elegance and for the sensitivity of his acting than as a virtuoso technician. As a partner he was grave and deferential, yet he never subsided meekly into the background. And as a poetic actor, he lifted male leading roles in the classic ballets to a new prominence... Mikhail Baryshnikov [said] &quot;He was indisputably one of the greatest dancers we have ever seen, and his dignity and style have been a model to us all, which can not be replaced.&quot;
Clive Barnes had named Bruhn &quot;the greatest male classical dancer of his time&quot; when Bruhn retired in 1972. In an appreciation of Bruhn&#x27;s accomplishments published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; shortly after his death, dance critic Anna Kisselgoff said:
He was, then, the model of perfection as a dancer – precise in every step, beautifully placed, a virtuoso technician, noble in bearing, elegant in every gesture. His line was extraordinary, his leg beats – a legacy of his Danish training – amazing. He was one of the few dancers who could bring the house down simply by executing a series of entrechats as James in &quot;La Sylphide&quot;. The steps, no matter how brilliantly executed, were always part of a deeper concept, part of a characterization. Erik Bruhn was a complete dancer – a far cry from the highly specialized artist he was often made out to be... His moral example to the rest of ballet came through the concentration and seriousness with which he committed himself to every role.
Bruhn authored &quot;Beyond Technique&quot; with photos by Fred Fehl (1968, reissued as No. 36 of &quot;Dance Perspectives&quot; in 1973), and with Lillian Moore he co-authored &quot;Bournonville and Ballet Technique: Studies and Comments on August Bournonville&#x27;s Etudes Choregraphiques&quot; (1961, reprinted 2005). He was the subject of the book &quot;Erik Bruhn: Danseur Noble&quot; (1979) by John Gruen, written with his cooperation and based in part on extensive interviews. A 2008 biography in Danish by Alexander Meinertz, &quot;Erik Bruhn – Billedet indeni&quot; (The Picture Within), has yet to be translated into English.

Bruhn was posthumously recognized in 1987 for &quot;exemplary contributions to Canada and its culture&quot; as the first recipient of the annual Pagurian Award for Excellence in the Arts.

In 2014 Heritage Toronto erected a plaque to him outside 135 George Street South in the St Lawrence Market area of Toronto, where he lived for many years.

==Legacy==
In a codicil to his will, Bruhn left part of his estate for the establishment of The Erik Bruhn Prize, recognizing dancers from the three companies with which he was most closely associated: the Royal Danish Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and the National Ballet of Canada, each of which are invited to send one male and one female dancer to the competition, held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bruhn specified that the prize be awarded to two young dancers who &quot;reflect such technical ability, artistic achievement and dedication as I endeavoured to bring to dance.&quot; Competitors for the prize are between the ages of 18 and 23 and are selected by their respective artistic directors. For the competition, each dancer performs in a classical pas de deux and variations and a contemporary pas de deux or solo work.

The first Erik Bruhn Prize was awarded in 1988.

<text>Djursholm () is one of four suburban districts in, and the seat of Danderyd Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden. Djursholm is included in the multi-municipal Stockholm urban area. Djursholm is divided into a number of different areas: Djursholms Ekeby (northwest), Svalnäs (northeast), Ösby (central), Berga (southwest) and Gamla Djursholm (&#x27;Old Djursholm&#x27;, southeast). It is also partly located in Täby Municipality.

==History==
Djursholm was one of the first suburban communities in Sweden, its history as such beginning in 1889 with the founding of Djursholm AB (Djursholm Inc.) by Henrik Palme and the subsequent 1890 inauguration of the railway line connecting Djursholm to Stockholm, Djursholmsbanan. Since 1895 it has been served by electric suburban trains but the original branch was closed in 1975.

Djursholm is the wealthiest community in Sweden, with the most expensive property prices in the country. It was built as a garden city with large villas, most from the turn of the century, along winding roads. From the start, the elegant seaside quarters attracted many well known academics, cultural personalities and industrialists.

Djursholm was separated from Danderyd as a municipality of its own in 1901, becoming a city (&quot;Djursholms stad&quot;) in 1914. In 1971 it was reunited with Danderyd when the present municipality was created. Statistically Djursholm lies within the Stockholm urban area.

==Sights==
* Djursholm Castle. The original stone building was likely erected by Nils Eskilsson Banér in the 15th century. Svante Gustavsson Banér commissioned a refurbishment of the castle to its current form in the 16th century
* Djursholm Chapel. Completed in 1902 on the initiative of Fredrik Lilljekvist, who was also the architect. The ornate altar paintings are by Natanael Beskow, who was the resident vicar at the time.
* Villa Pauli. Large villa on Strandvägen in central Djursholm, designed by Ragnar Östberg and completed in 1907. Since 1986, Villa Pauli has been a private club with a gourmet restaurant, banquet room and hotel.
* Germania beach. Sandy beach that has become a popular destination for people from Djursholm and surrounding areas. Situated at the end of Strandvägen and Germaniavägen, two of the central roads of Djursholm.

<doc id="534610" wikidata="Q2993026" url="?curid=534610" title="Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence">
<text>In number theory, the Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence is a result published in 1953 by N. C. Ankeny, Emil Artin and S. Chowla. It concerns the class number &quot;h&quot; of a real quadratic field of discriminant &quot;d&quot; &gt; 0. If the fundamental unit of the field is

:formula_1

with integers &quot;t&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, it expresses in another form

:formula_2

for any prime number &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2 that divides &quot;d&quot;. In case &quot;p&quot; &gt; 3 it states that

:formula_3

where formula_4   and  formula_5  is the Dirichlet character for the quadratic field. For &quot;p&quot; = 3 there is a factor (1 + &quot;m&quot;) multiplying the LHS. Here

:formula_6

represents the floor function of &quot;x&quot;.

A related result is that if &quot;d=p&quot; is congruent to one mod four, then

:formula_7

where &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;th Bernoulli number.

There are some generalisations of these basic results, in the papers of the authors.

<doc id="534611" wikidata="Q1328889" url="?curid=534611" title="BMW 5 Series (E34)">
<text>The BMW E34 is the third generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was produced from 2 November 1987, until 1996. Initially launched as a saloon in January 1988, the E34 also saw a &quot;Touring&quot; station wagon (estate) body style added in September 1992, a first for the 5 Series. BMW replaced the E34 with the E39 5 Series in December 1995, although E34 Touring models remained in production until June 1996.

The E34 generation marked the first time all-wheel drive was incorporated into the 5 Series with the 525iX, and the first V8 engine to be used in a 5 Series. The E34 also saw the introduction of stability control (ASC), traction control (ASC+T), a 6-speed manual transmission and adjustable damping (EDC) to the 5 Series range.

There was an unusually large range of engines fitted over its lifetime as nine different engine families were used. These consisted of straight-four, straight-six and V8 engines.

The E34 M5 is powered by the S38 straight-six engine and was produced in saloon and wagon body styles.

== Development and launch ==
Development ran from July 1981 to early 1987, with the initial design proposal penned by Ercole Spada in 1982. Under the guidance of chief designer Claus Luthe, BMW based much of the design on the E32 7 Series. Following Spada&#x27;s departure from BMW and styling approval in 1983, J Mays finalized the design for production in mid-1985. Special attention was paid to aerodynamics, with the E34 basic saloon having a drag coefficient of 0.30.

Series production began in November 1987. In December 1987, the E34 saloon was unveiled to global press.
== Body styles ==
Saloon models have a length of , a width of and a height of . Wagon models have a length of and a height of . All models have a wheelbase of .

* 5-speed ZF 5HP30 - 540i

== Suspension ==
Front suspension consists of double pivot MacPherson struts, with a replaceable shock absorber cartridge inside a steel strut housing. Control arms and thrust arms control front-to-back and side-to-side movement. Steering on most models is a rack and pinion design, however the 530i and 540i with the M60 V8 engines use a recirculating ball steering. The all-wheel drive 525iX uses a rack and pinion steering system along with front suspension similar to the E30 3 Series 325iX model. All front suspension components are steel, except that the lower control arms on some models are aluminum.

Rear suspension consists of semi-trailing arms with coil springs integrated in a strut assembly.

== Models ==
=== Petrol-engined ===
The base model, available only in Europe, was the petrol-powered four-cylinder 518i. Only available with a 5-speed manual transmission, a total of 53,248 cars were produced.

The next petrol model up was the six-cylinder 520i, which began production in January 1988. It was initially powered by the BMW M20 single overhead camshaft engine, which was replaced by the BMW M50 double overhead camshaft engine in 1990. The 520i was the second most popular E34 model globally, with 426,971 units produced. The 525i was the most popular E34 model globally with 434,549 units produced. As per the 520i, the 525i initially used the M20 engine, which was replaced by the M50 engine in 1990.

Engine volume and year of manufacture often influenced the type of wiring. This was of great importance for decoding the configuration and the possibility of further retrofitting. Thus, cars can be divided into two types: high and low. Wiring had a big influence to the amount of possible options and functions of a car. There also was update after M50 and M60 introduce.

A rare E34 model is the petrol-powered six-cylinder 525iX, of which only 9,366 cars were produced. The 525iX was the first all-wheel drive 5 Series, and the only all-wheel drive model in the E34 range. It was powered by the BMW M50 engine and was the first 5 Series to use a rack and pinion steering system.

There are two versions of the E34 530i: an inline-six model produced from 1988 to 1990, and a V8 model produced from 1993 to 1995. The earlier model was one of the last applications of the BMW M30 inline-six engine. The V8 version, which replaced the six-cylinder 535i in the lineup, was powered by the new BMW M60 V8 engine and was available with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. Initially, the V8 models were differentiated from other models by the wide grill; in 1994 the wide grill became available on other models. Between the two versions of the 530i, a total of 57,570 cars were produced.

The highest six-cylinder model (except for the M5) was the 535i. Despite the &#x27;535i&#x27; model designation and &#x27;3.5&#x27; casting on the intake manifold, the BMW M30 engine found in the E34 535i actually has a displacement of . There was also a 535i Sport model with M-technic body kit, boot spoiler with brake light, sport seats, M-Tech sports leather steering wheel (M-tech 1 for 1988-1989 cars, M-tech 2 for 1990–1992), M-technic suspension (M-tech springs, stiffer shocks, M-tech 25mm front stabilizer bar, M-tech 18mm rear stabilizer bar), a polished rocker cover and also a limited-slip differential (25% lock) as standard. A total of 97,679 cars were produced, including the Alpina B10 (BiTurbo, 3.5) models. The 535i was replaced by the V8-engined 530i and 540i models in 1993.

In 1993, the 540i model was added to the top of the 5 Series lineup, powered by the BMW M60 V8 engine and available in both Saloon and wagon body styles (the latter not in US). Transmission options were a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. A total of 26,485 units were produced. Initially, the V8 models were differentiated from other models by the wider grilles. In 1994 the wide grilles became available on other models as well.

=== Diesel-engined ===
The first diesel model was the 524td, which was introduced in 1988. This model was replaced by the 525tds in 1991, and a lower-specification 525td was introduced in 1993. Only the 525tds model was fitted with an intercooler.

=== North America ===
In the United States, the E34 model range was launched in October 1988 with the 525i and 535i 6-cylinder models (for the 1989 model year). Over the course of the E34 generation, the 525i Touring, 530i, 530i Touring, 540i and M5 models were sold in the United States. The version of the M5 remained in production until 1993, by which time the version was being produced for other countries.
== M5 model ==

Introduced in September 1988 and produced until August 1995, the E34 M5 was produced in both saloon and station wagon (&#x27;Touring&#x27;) body styles, the latter being the first M5 to be available as a wagon.

The E34 M5 is powered by the BMW S38 inline-six engine, originally with a displacement of and an output of , later upgraded to a engine rated at . This 3.8 litre version of the M5 was first seen by the public at the 1991 Frankfurt Motor Show, where the E34 M5 Touring also saw its debut.

In its last year of production for the M5, the transmission was upgraded from a 5-speed manual to the Getrag 420G 6-speed manual (which was also used by the 540i model).
== Special models ==
=== 518g ===
A model which could run on natural gas (as well as petrol) and was only sold in Germany. The 518g was based on the 518i Touring model and the only transmission available was a 5-speed manual. The engine, also used by the 1995–2000 3 Series Compact 316g model, was a re-tuned version of the BMW M43 four-cylinder engine. When running on natural gas, the engine produced , compared with when running on petrol. It was only produced in 1995 and just 298 units were built.

=== 518iev prototype ===
After unveiling the BMW E1 and E2 concept car electric vehicles in 1992, BMW began a project to show it was possible to make a full-sized electric car, despite the obstacle of the weight of the lead-acid battery technology at the time. The batteries were a lead-acid type and the electric motors used a rotating-field AC electric drive. To assist the electric drivetrain, the 518iev also had a four-cylinder petrol engine and a continuously variable transmission, a configuration similar to the first production hybrid cars produced by other manufacturers several years later. BMW built at least one fully functional E34 prototype, which was tested in the late 1990s by Deutsche Post and others.

=== 540i M-sport / M540i / 540i LE ===

Because the M5 was discontinued for non-European markets in 1993, the 540i M-Sport model was built in 1995 for the North American market. On top of the regular 540i features, additional features included sports suspension equipped with EDC, bolstered sport seats, servotronic steering, and US-spec M5 brakes. 205 &quot;M-Sport&quot; models were built, 139 of them with the 6-speed manual transmission.

An M540i model was produced for in Canada. It includes the features of the North American 540i M-sport, plus upgraded Euro-spec M5 brakes, 18-inch M-parallel wheels, and various trim pieces. Only 32 of these cars were built, all with a manual transmission.

The 540i LE (i.e. Limited Edition) saloon was sold in Australia and the United Kingdom. The 540i LE included the interior from the M5, &quot;throwing star&quot; M-System II wheels, EDC suspension with self leveling rear, Servotronic power steering, and front air dam. 70 of these 540i LE saloons were produced, all with a manual transmission, each individually numbered using an engraved metal plaque stuck onto the centre console beneath the handbrake lever.

== Alpina models ==

=== B10 3.0 AllRad ===
This model is based on the 525iX with an enlarged 3 litre engine producing 231bhp instead of 192bhp. Between 1993 and 1996 64 saloon cars and 70 Touring cars were produced by the Alpina factory in Buchloe with a very small number of right hand drive cars, 2 saloons and 1 Touring, converted by Sytner, the Alpina Dealer in Nottingham, England.

=== B10 3.5 ===
This model is based on the 535i with a modified 3.5 litre engine producing 254bhp instead of 220bhp. Between 1988 and 1992 572 left hand drive cars were made in Buchloe, with perhaps 30 or so right hand converted by Sytner. The B10 3.5 was only supplied as a saloon car and no Touring cars were made.

=== B10 4.0 ===
This model is based on the 540i with a modified 4 litre engine producing 315bhp instead of 286bhp. Between 1993 and 1995 45 saloon cars and 4 Touring cars were produced by Buchloe, all left hand drive, with a further two right hand drive saloon cars converted by Sytner.

=== B10 4.6 ===
This model is based on the 540i with an Alpina designed 4.6 litre engine which was used also in the E36 Alpina B8 4.6. Between 1994 and 1996 27 saloon cars and 19 Touring cars were produced by Buchloe, all left hand drive except one right hand drive Touring car. With 7bhp more than the B8 4.6 (due to the larger exhaust manifold) it produces the same 340bhp as the E34 3.8 M5 Touring but with nearly 20% more torque. It was also available in right hand drive unlike the M5 Touring.

=== B10 BiTurbo ===
The B10 BiTurbo was based on a highly modified 535i and introduced in March 1989 after a $3.2million investment in R&amp;D. Despite being nearly twice the price of a BMW M5 it sold well and production ceased in 1995 after 507 saloon models were made, and only after BMW ceased producing the M30 engine upon which the engine was based. It was not available in right hand drive due to the turbochargers placement or as a touring model. It produced 360bhp and 375lb/ft of torque on full boost, just 20bhp and 21lb/ft more than the B10 4.6. Along with the Lotus Carlton it was considered one of the fastest saloon cars in the world.

== Model year changes ==
BMW E34 had no facelift as such. All updates were introduced gradually and sometimes were country specific. Most changes occur in September each year, when the changes for the following model year go into production, as is typical BMW practice.

<doc id="534614" wikidata="Q3439049" url="?curid=534614" title="Roger Grimes">
<text>Roger D. Grimes (born May 2, 1950) is a Canadian politician from Newfoundland and Labrador. Grimes was born and raised in the central Newfoundland town of Grand Falls-Windsor.

Grimes is a former leader of the province&#x27;s Liberal Party and was its eighth premier from February 2001 until November 2003.

A teacher by profession, Grimes was elected president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association in 1985, a position he held for two years.

==Politics==
In 1989, Grimes was elected to the House of Assembly representing Exploits district.

Grimes entered the cabinet of Premier Clyde Wells in 1991 as Minister of Employment and Labour Relations, followed by service as Minister of Tourism, Culture and Recreation. Under Premier Brian Tobin, Grimes was by now a senior Minister and served in the portfolios of Education, Mines and Energy, and Health and Community Servies.

=== 2001 NL Liberal Leadership Convention ===
Grimes won the 2001 Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador Leadership to become Party Leader, defeating John Efford by 14 votes in a fierce and divisive contest in Mount Pearl. Efford and fellow leadership contestant Paul Dicks subsequently left provincial politics saying they could not work under the leadership of Grimes.

===Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador===
Grimes was sworn in as Premier on February 13, 2001. The same year he became Premier, the name of the province was officially changed to Newfoundland and Labrador.

In 2002, Grimes called for a review of the Act of Union by which the province had become a part of Canada and on July 2, 2003, the findings of the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening Our Place in Canada were released. It noted the following stressors in the relationship between the province and Canada:

*The huge impact on the province by the destruction of the cod stocks.
*Hydroelectricity resources in Labrador have primarily benefited Quebec.
*Chronically high unemployment; the highest in Canada.
*Lowest per-capita income in Canada.
*The highest tax rates in the country.
*The most out-migration of any province in Canada.

The report called for:

*more collaborative federalism;
*an action team to deal with the fishery in waters surrounding Newfoundland;
*collaboration between Canada, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador on the development of the Gull Island hydro site on the lower part of the Churchill River;
*revision of the Atlantic Accord, negotiated by the provincial and federal governments in the 1980s, to ensure that offshore oil and gas royalties primarily benefit the province (this recommendation was one of the earliest priorities of Grimes&#x27; successor, Danny Williams);
*immediate and realistic negotiations on joint management of the fishery.

Also in 2003, the federal government declared a moratorium on the last remaining cod fishery in Atlantic Canada in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Newfoundland and Labrador was again the most directly affected province. As Grimes was dealing with this issue, and others facing the province, time was soon running out on his tenure.

Despite his attempts to strike an image as a fresh government, Grimes and his Liberals were defeated in the October 2003 provincial election by the Progressive Conservatives under Danny Williams, bringing an end to 14 years of Liberal rule in Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Retirement and later life==
On May 30, 2005, Grimes resigned the seat he had held in the legislature for 16 years and stepped down as the leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador. He is quoted as saying that the time was right for him to retire from provincial politics. Gerry Reid became interim leader after Grimes announced his retirement.

In March 2011, the provincial Liberals held their first fundraiser of the year. The event was a roast of Grimes, called “Grimes and Punishment” and was held in St. John&#x27;s.

Grimes was critical of the Lower Churchill Project and fellow Liberal Premier Dwight Ball. In June 2016, he was banned from the Capital Hyundai Arena after he made negative comments about the former Chair of Nalcor&#x27;s Board of Directors, Ken Marshall (who had been involved in a scandal regarding payments from the provincial government). Marshall&#x27;s brother, Steve Marshall, is the owner of the rink and made the decision following Grimes&#x27;s comments.

Grimes was appointed to the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board for a six-year term effective April 10, 2018.

==Honours==
* Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002). 
* Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012). 
* Member of the Order of Canada (CM) 22 November 2019.

<text>Care Bears are multi-colored bears, painted in 1981 by artist Elena Kucharik to be used on greeting cards from American Greetings. They were turned into plush teddy bears and featured in &quot;The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine&quot; (1984) before headlining their own television series called &quot;Care Bears&quot; from 1985 to 1988. They also had multiple feature films including: &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; (1985), &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot; (1987).

Each Care Bear is a different colour or shade and has a unique image on their stomach (referred to in various media as a &quot;tummy symbols&quot; or &quot;belly badges&quot;) that represents their personality or specialty. The Care Bears family also include the &quot;Care Bear Cousins&quot;, which feature different animals, such as a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon and other animals created in the same style as the Care Bears.

In 2002, new plush versions of the bears were manufactured by Play Along Toys. This relaunch of the franchise featured in three animated films: &quot;Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot&quot; (2004), &quot;The Care Bears&#x27; Big Wish Movie&quot; (2005), and &quot;Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!&quot; (2007).

A revival TV series, &quot;Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot,&quot; premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012, for one season. A continuation with the same characters, &quot;Care Bears &amp; Cousins&quot;, was commissioned by Netflix and premiered in 2015. That year, toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figurines, and blind bag collectibles) based on the series.

The current TV series, &quot;Care Bears: Unlock the Magic&quot;, debuted on Boomerang SVOD on February 1, 2019, and has since tied in with a new toy line from Basic Fun.

==History==

===Development===
The Care Bears were created in 1981 by Elena Kucharik for the greeting card company American Greetings. Jack Chojnacki, the co-president of &quot;Those Characters From Cleveland&quot; (TCFC) (the toy and licensing design division of American Greetings), introduced the first Care Bear to businessmen from American Greetings and from the toy company Kenner in February 1981. On the employees&#x27; reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: &quot;It had a high aaaaaah factor.&quot;

Artist Muriel Fahrion, who helped create Strawberry Shortcake&#x27;s look, was among the franchise&#x27;s first concept artists. Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Fahrion designed the first six bears, using the company&#x27;s most popular greeting card themes for their tummy graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel&#x27;s sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the first Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage, children&#x27;s book illustrator Elena Kucharik became the lead artist for the Care Bears, creating hundreds of full-color illustrations for books, clothing, stationery and various other licensed products, as well as greeting cards. TCFC&#x27;s team of artists and writers created many characters in the line in a joint development by TCFC and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of General Mills).

American Greetings kept the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, &quot;Care Bears&quot; was established as the project&#x27;s working title.

===1982 launch===
On September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area&#x27;s Society of Security Analysts. President Morry Weiss represented American Greetings; Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal represented Those Characters From Cleveland.

The characters were produced as a line of toys by Kenner the following Spring, consisting of plush teddy bears and plastic poseable figures and miniatures. on a $5–6 million advertising budget and a wholesale commitment worth $122.5 million (USD). American Greetings introduced the characters to the general public in February 1983, with an appearance at New York City&#x27;s Toy Fair; 26 licensees were involved upon launch. Among them was General Mills, a food company which owned the board game manufacturer Parker Brothers. In early 1983, Parker Brothers released six books featuring the Care Bears as part of its publishing division&#x27;s first offerings. On television, the original 10 Bears were featured in a syndicated special, Atkinson Film-Arts&#x27; &quot;The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings,&quot; produced and sponsored by Kenner.

In December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as &quot;Message Bears&quot;. According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the &quot;heart-shaped &#x27;touché tags&#x27;&quot; used to identify the Care Bears.

In 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins. Another syndicated special, &quot;The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine&quot;, aired the same year. A miniseries based on the toys was distributed by Lexington Broadcast Services Company. A year later, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins appeared in their first animated feature film &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, produced by the Canadian animation studio Nelvana and released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company in original prints and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in current prints. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the Disney market at the time of its release. Later that autumn, DIC Audiovisuel released an 11-episode television series in syndication, which incorporated elements from the Atkinson Film-Arts specials (with the specials&#x27; villains Professor Coldheart and his sidekick Frostbite appearing regularly, and some of the music from the specials being featured in the series) and the Nelvana film (with the Forest of Feelings, the home of the Care Bear Cousins, being a regular setting in the series).
In 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second film, &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation.&quot; Released by Columbia Pictures, the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.

Later that year, the television series &quot;The Care Bears Family&quot; (also from Nelvana) premiered in mid-1986 on the U.S. ABC network and Canadian Global. Lasting three seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard No Heart and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart&#x27;s niece Shreeky was introduced. It also added more development to the Care Bear and Care Bear Cousin characters, with issues such as conflict and depression being addressed through the characters themselves in some episodes.

Around the same time production for &quot;The Care Bears Family&quot; was underway, Sally Industries (now known as Sally Dark Rides) obtained a license from American Greetings and Nelvana to develop an animatronic stage show based on the franchise. This show, known as &quot;Care Bears: Care-A-Lot Castle&quot;, was produced in-house at Sally&#x27;s facilities and with no involvement from the crew behind the animated series. Out of the main cast at the time, only Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Grumpy Bear, and Friend Bear were utilized. The characters of No Heart and Beastly appear through disembodied voices recorded into the show&#x27;s soundtrack, but only in Professor Coldheart, the previous villain, is mentioned in the Indonesian dub of Care-A-Lot Castle&#x27;s soundtrack. Instead of using pre-existing Care Bears songs, Sally opted to produce original songs and recycle songs from their own catalog for Care-A-Lot Castle. One notable song choice, exclusive to the English version, was a cover of &quot;Brazzle Dazzle Day&quot; from Disney&#x27;s 1977 film, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;. A total of two shows were built by Sally under this agreement. The first installation was located at Dunia Fantasi, an Indonesian theme park, where the show was locally translated under the name &quot;Beruang Madu (Sun Bears)&quot; complete with a dubbed soundtrack for the 1987 season. The second installation was built for Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom in the United States, which premiered a year later with the original English soundtrack. Both shows would operate until at least 1992, with Dorney Park&#x27;s installation said to have be destroyed when the park&#x27;s license expired. 

The Care Bears&#x27; third film, &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot;, released by Cineplex Odeon Films, premiered in 1987. A holiday-themed television special, &quot;Care Bears Nutcracker Suite&quot;, which also served as the series finale for &quot;The Care Bears Family&quot; premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.

Over 40 million Care Bears toys were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70 million of their greeting cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2 billion during the 1980s.

===1991 relaunch (&quot;Caring About the Environment&quot;)===
In 1991, &quot;Those Characters From Cleveland&quot; and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of these, Proud Heart Bear, is distinctly different from the Care Bear Cousin of a similar name, Proud Heart Cat. This character was released as a bear with white fur that sported the tummy symbol of a heart-shaped American flag. In 2003, Proud Heart Bear was re-released as a collector&#x27;s edition plush toy by Play Along under the name America Cares Bear, sporting the tummy symbol of a shooting star with the colors of the American flag. The publishing company Random House released two tie-in books: &quot;The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup&quot; (1991) by Bobbi Katz, and &quot;The Care Bears and the Whale Tale&quot; (1992) by Peggy Kahn.

===2002 relaunch===
In 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by Jay Foreman, the president of Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company Play Along Toys, for less than $1 million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake. Three years later, American Greetings relaunched the Care Bears brand as part of the Bears&#x27; 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and films. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for the relaunch. Also, Champ Bear&#x27;s fur color was changed from tan/yellow to true blue, with his tummy symbol changed from a trophy with a heart to a trophy with a star, and Share Bear&#x27;s tummy symbol was changed from an ice cream soda with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear&#x27;s symbol stems from Play Along Toys&#x27; suggestion of the change because sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening or saturating the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the tummy symbols.

During this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as Walmart, Kmart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Target, KB Toys, and Mervyns. The new merchandise included the Bears doing aerobics; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child who is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs, an idea previously used in the original 1980s incarnation of the franchise. Over 70 million plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.

New versions of the Care Bear Cousins were produced (with Proud Heart Cat sporting a different fur color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13-inch plush toys in the 2000s, and the Care Bear Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.

In April 2003, it was announced that a new CGI-animated movie from Nelvana, &quot;The Care Bears in King Funshine the Great&quot;, had been acquired by Artisan Entertainment for U.S. distribution. The movie was eventually renamed &quot;Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot&quot; and was released on October 5, 2004 by Lions Gate Home Entertainment, as they had acquired Artisan by this point, with international distribution handled by Universal Studios Home Video. Another CGI-animated movie, &quot;The Care Bears&#x27; Big Wish Movie,&quot; was released a year later. Another CGI-animated movie from Nelvana also was planned, but later scrapped.

===2007 relaunch===
In 2006, AG Properties announced that to coincide with the franchise&#x27;s 25th-anniversary celebrations, the Care Bears would be given a new, refreshed look with a new TV series and a feature-length movie titled, &quot;Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!&quot; to be released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment during 2007. It also was announced that AG had acquired all of Nelvana&#x27;s Care Bears projects along the way.

The new look was done by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, alongside a new logo. Fifteen of the 39 bears were represented in this new look, while five of them were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, Share Bear, and new-addition, Oopsy Bear. In August 2007, &quot;Oopsy Does It!&quot; was given a limited theatrical release by Kidtoon Films. Essentially a pilot to the traditionally-animated television series, &quot;Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot&quot;, the movie was made to introduce the new look to the public audience. The TV series itself would premiere on CBS on September 15, 2007, as part of the block KEWLopolis, a joint-run block by AG and DIC Entertainment, with both the movie and series being produced by SD Entertainment. A new theme song was created, known as &quot;We Are the Care Bears,&quot; and was performed by former Letters to Cleo member Kay Hanley. The associated music video premiered on Fox, Nickelodeon and MuchMusic.

As the 2007 era was a reboot, prior plot devices, like the Cloudmobiles, the Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper and Care-a-Lot Castle, were neither referred to nor mentioned in the new series. In its place is the Gathering Tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears had never had humans visit Care-a-Lot Castle, and so a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-Lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February, 2007 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; states that in the new version, &quot;they live in a village, centered on a big tree, with no castle in sight&quot;.

In mid-2008, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released two DVDs, &quot;Grizzle-y Adventures&quot; and &quot;Ups and Downs&quot;. These DVDs each contained two special DVD-exclusive episodes, which brought back Humans and the Care-O-Meter. The latter also included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. Care-a-Lot Castle also reappeared in the educational video game &quot;Care Bears: Play Day&quot;, for the V-Smile Baby.

On July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; and &quot;Sushi Pack&quot;) would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008. By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise. The deadline for Cookie Jar&#x27;s acquisition was April 30, and MoonScoop&#x27;s attempt June 7. In mid-August 2009, MoonScoop sued American Greetings, claiming the latter backed out of the planned $95 million-dollar deal; AGC and Cookie Jar sued each other in the process as well. By late April 2010, the Cleveland company &quot;won summary judgement on MoonScoop SAS&#x27; contract&quot;, as well as &quot;promissory estoppel claims&quot; in the case; MoonScoop filed for an appeal the following month. At the end of November, 2012, the U.S. District Court in Cleveland ruled in favor of American Greetings over MoonScoop.

In late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears would be reimagined with the launch of a new series, &quot;Care Power Team&quot;. This series would have the bears sport &quot;enhanced belly badges&quot;, and see them taking on emergencies. Although such a series never occurred, the Care Power Team format was used for three new CGI-animated movies – &quot;Care Bears: To the Rescue&quot;, &quot;Care Bears: The Giving Festival&quot;, and &quot;Care Bears: Share Bear Shines&quot;, which were released in 2010 and 2011.

In that same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears had changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro.

===2012 relaunch===
In July 2011, American Greetings announced that another brand refresh and a new television series was in development to coincide with the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary, and would be the first to be animated in CGI animation. The central cast of Bears changed again, this time focusing on Tenderheart Bear, Cheer Bear, Share Bear, Grumpy Bear, Funshine Bear, Harmony Bear, and new addition, Wonderheart Bear.

The series was entitled &quot;Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot&quot;, which was produced by MoonScoop&#x27;s US studio and premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012.

In December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced that they would collaborate with Japanese toy and licensing design company Sanrio for a co-branding with their character franchise &quot;Little Twin Stars&quot;. An expanded roll-out was expected in March 2014.

In July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company, Just Play.

In October, 2014, when The Hub changed over to Discovery Family, &quot;Welcome to Care-A-Lot&quot; was cancelled.

After The Hub cancelled &quot;Welcome to Care-a-Lot,&quot; on January 15, 2015, Netflix commissioned a new TV series called &quot;Care Bears &amp; Cousins&quot;. This series was basically a continuation of &quot;Welcome to Care-a-Lot&quot;, but with the reintroduction of four of the Care Bear Cousins – Brave Heart Lion, Lotsa Heart Elephant, Cozy Heart Penguin and Bright Heart Raccoon. The series was expected to premiere in 2016, but the release was pushed forward to November 2015 when it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes. As with &quot;Welcome to Care-a-Lot&quot;, then-renamed Splash Entertainment did the animation for this series.

In 2017, the franchise celebrated its 35th anniversary.

===2019 relaunch===
In May 2018, an advertisement showcased at the Licensing Expo (a licensing trade show) showcased new redesigns of the Care Bears. Eventually, this was confirmed by the then-rebranded Cloudco Entertainment in September 2018, when they announced they would be making a new television series, titled &quot;Care Bears: Unlock the Magic&quot;. For the first time in a Care Bears series, the setting is set outside of Care-a-Lot in a mysterious world known as the Silver Lining, populated by creatures known as the Whiffles. The main 5 Bears for this incarnation were Grumpy, Cheer, Share, Funshine and Good Luck, with the series also featuring the main Whiffle character known as Dibble, serving as &quot;the team&#x27;s newest pet and companion&quot;.

The series premiered on the Boomerang premium streaming service on February 1, 2019; however, the first episode was released on January 28, 2019. The series order included 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts.

For the 2019 International Day of the Girl, humanitarian organization CARE had celebrities design one-of-a-kind Care Bears and place them up for auction to benefit the charity. Sophia Bush based Justice Bear on Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

In 2020, Basic Fun released a new Care Bears line of toys in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. In 2024, Basic Fun filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company will use bankruptcy proceedings to repay its creditors while remaining in operation.

In 2022, the franchise celebrated its 40th anniversary.

On October 16, 2024, WildBrain announced the production of &quot;The Care Berry Switch&quot;, a forty-four minute special that crosses over with &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot;.

==Characters==
The franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of these groups live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-Lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (the home of the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; referred to them as &quot;the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents of what we used to know as guardian angels: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen&quot;.

Accompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions of caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and who watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-Lot.

The 10 original Care Bears consist of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-Lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.

For the 2007 TV series, &quot;Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot&quot;, five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the TV series. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the film, Oopsy Bear, a Care Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.

Some elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of King Arthur. For example, the name of the main characters&#x27; residence, Care-a-Lot, is a play on King Arthur&#x27;s legendary Camelot castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the Round Table used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, Sir Lancelot&#x27;s name inspired that of Love-a-Lot Bear.

Throughout the films and various TV series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions and rid the world of the love and caring the Care Bears and the Cousins use. In the first two specials and DiC TV series, they battled against Professor Coldheart, his assistant Frostbite, and occasionally, Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana&#x27;s version, they faced the wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant Beastly, and his ill-tempered niece Shreeky, and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the films, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, Dark Heart in &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation&quot;, The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim and Dum in &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot;, and the Rat King and the Evil Vizier in &quot;Care Bears Nutcracker Suite&quot;. 

Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the film &quot;Care Bears Journey to Joke-a-lot&quot;, while &quot;The Care Bears&#x27; Big Wish Movie&quot; broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film &quot;Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!&quot; introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persist into the TV series, &quot;Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot&quot;. Additional Care Bears introduced in &quot;Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot&quot; include Wonderheart Bear and Great Giving Bear.

===Magic spells===
The Care Bears&#x27; ultimate weapon is the &quot;Care Bear Stare&quot;, in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which can bring care and joy into the target&#x27;s heart, break dark spells, or revive something that has been broken, wilted, or messed up. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the tummy being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Care Bears and/or Care Bear Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The films &quot;Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot&quot; and &quot;The Care Bears&#x27; Big Wish Movie&quot; do not feature the Care Bear Stare, but it does return in &quot;Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!&quot;. In the new TV series, &quot;Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot&quot;, the Care Bear Stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates.

In the original animated specials and the DiC TV series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase &quot;Care Bears...prepare to stare!&quot; while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase &quot;Care Bears Countdown!&quot;

The Care Bear Cousins have their own variant of the Stare called the Care Cousin Call. In the DiC series, the Call looks identical to the Stare in appearance. In &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, the Cousins made whatever animal noise according to their species due to not possessing any tummy symbols; those were given to them by Tenderheart at the end of the movie. In &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation&quot;, the Call has the effect of a multicolored musical score. By the Nelvana series, the Call was no longer referred to and the cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.

Although commonly used on villains, the stare and call also have been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC TV series to cure Care Bears and humans who were under the effects of Professor Coldheart&#x27;s uncaring magic. It also occurred once in &quot;Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot&quot;, when it was used to temporarily cheer up Grumpy Bear in the episode &quot;Tell-Tale Tummy&quot;.

In addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears also can use their tummy symbols to summon other assistance, such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges, and sending out a distress signal.

Usually, a tummy symbol&#x27;s power is initiated by will, but in &quot;Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot&quot;, a Care Bear has to rub its tummy to activate it. By &quot;Welcome to Care-a-lot&quot;, the belly badges activate by will once again, though the bears may rub their belly to activate it on occasion.

==Merchandise==

Apart from toys, books, greeting cards, and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in merchandising as well, some of which include decorated lunchboxes, party goods, iron-on patches, bags, stationery, interior decoration sets, bedding, school supplies, keychains, clothing, umbrellas, accessories and many other goods. During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire&#x27;s, and Spencer Gifts.

When the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, an error occurred during the manufacturing process of the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two Care Bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children&#x27;s story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.

In his 1986 essay, &quot;The Shortcake Strategy&quot;, Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as &quot;highly specialized&quot; toys. &quot;So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality&quot;, he stated. &quot;Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.&quot;

==Books==

Many children&#x27;s books have been based on, and featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include &quot;Meet the Care Bear Cousins&quot; (featuring stills from the first movie), &quot;Sweet Dreams for Sally&quot;, &quot;The Witch Down the Street&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Timothy&quot;, and &quot;A Sister for Sam&quot;. All of these titles were published by Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s. In 2006, Scholastic Press published books based on the Bears&#x27; first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing published a small number of activity and baby books featuring the Bears for the infant and toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press also are known to have published a few sound books featuring the Bears in the past.

In &quot;Playing by Different Rules&quot;, a 1988 book chronicling the Parker Brothers/General Mills merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker&#x27;s Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) &quot;were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner&#x27;s projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?&quot;

==Comics==
Between November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published under Marvel&#x27;s Star Comics imprint and featured art by Howard Post. Issue #13 (from November 13, 1986) featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, Madballs.

During the same period, in Great Britain, the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover &quot;Care Bear Annual&quot; books. Some of these U.K. comic book issues also had stories and art from the U.S. comic series.

A comic book based on the Care Bears: Unlock the Magic was announced by IDW Publishing in March 2019. It was released in July 2019.

==Music==

During the 1980s, Kid Stuff Records released several vinyl LPs based on the franchise. &quot;Introducing the Care Bears&quot; was released in 1982. In 1983, four more LP&#x27;s were also introduced: &quot;The Care Bears Care for You&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Care-a-Lot&quot;, &quot;The Care Bears Off To See The World&quot; and &quot;The Care Bears&#x27; Christmas&quot;. &quot;The Care Bears&#x27; Birthday Party&quot; was released the following year in 1984. In 1986, &quot;Friends Make Everything Better&quot; was released as a promotion with Triaminic cough medicine. They also released the soundtrack albums for the first films. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children&#x27;s music during this time.

All of the albums from 1982 and 1983 featured writing, production, and performance credits from Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan. The soundtrack album from &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; featured songs by Carole King and John Sebastian.

In the 2002 revival, Madacy Kids released new Care Bears CDs. In 2004, &quot;Meet the Care Bears&quot;, &quot;Care Bears Holiday Hugs&quot;, &quot;Care Bears Christmas Eve&quot;, and the &quot;Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-Lot&quot; soundtrack album was released. In 2005, &quot;Care Bears Nighty-Night&quot; was released. Music students at Roger Williams University were invited to submit to the soundtrack, but such submissions ultimately were not included.

==Video games==

A Care Bears video game was planned for the Atari 2600 in 1983. Preliminary production was completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was cancelled before testing could begin – largely due to uninteresting gameplay and the diminishing video game market, which resulted in the video game crash of 1983. The beta prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early alpha of the video game. No other video games featuring the Care Bears were made during this period.

In 2004, the Care Bears starred in their first official game, &quot;Care-a-Lot Jamboree&quot;, for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Ball!&quot; was released. In the same year, they were featured in &quot;Care Bears A Lesson in Caring&quot; for the V.Smile educational game console.

In 2005, they appeared in &quot;Catch a Star&quot; (also for the PC) and &quot;Care Bears: Care Quest&quot; (for the Game Boy Advance).

In August, 2008 a new game, &quot;Care Bears Play Day&quot;, was released for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System.

A new interactive toy, &quot;Care Bears Share-a-Story&quot;, was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. Based upon a concept similar to Teddy Ruxpin, the Care Bear&#x27;s head, mouth and eyes move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales, such as &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, and &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;. A hardback book version of the story accompanied it so that parent and child could read along as the story played. The toy shipped with the story, &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, while additional story cartridges and books could be purchased separately.

Care Bears Sing-Along pals also were introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and can synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group. While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear, and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.

<text>Alexander Johan Hjalmar Skarsgård (; born 25 August 1976) is a Swedish actor. A son of actor Stellan Skarsgård, he began acting at age seven but quit at 13. After serving in the Swedish Navy, Skarsgård returned to acting and gained his first role in the US comedy film &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001). He played Brad Colbert in the miniseries &quot;Generation Kill&quot; (2008), and had his breakthrough portraying vampire Eric Northman in the television series &quot;True Blood&quot; (2008–2014).

After appearing in films such as &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011), &quot;Battleship&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot; (2016), Skarsgård starred in the drama series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; (2017–2019) as an abusive husband, which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. He went on to appear in the films &quot;Long Shot&quot; (2019), &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; (2021), &quot;Passing&quot; (2021), &quot;The Northman&quot; (2022), which he also produced, and &quot;Infinity Pool&quot; (2023). He also played Randall Flagg in the miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot; (2020–2021) and tech mogul Lukas Matsson in the drama series &quot;Succession&quot; (2021–2023), for which he was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.

==Early life==
Skarsgård was born on 25 August 1976 in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the eldest son of actor Stellan Skarsgård and physician My Skarsgård. His parents are divorced. He has five younger siblings: Gustaf, Sam, Bill, Eija and Valter, and two half-brothers from his father&#x27;s second wife, Megan Everett. Gustaf, Bill and Valter are also actors.

A friend of his father, a director, gave Skarsgård his first film role when he was seven years old, playing Kalle Nubb in &quot;Åke and His World&quot; (&quot;Åke och hans värld&quot;). In 1989, his lead role in the Swedish television production &quot;Hunden som log&quot; (&quot;The Dog That Smiled&quot;) earned him praise and brought him to prominence in Sweden at age 13. Uncomfortable with the fame, he quit acting at that same age.

At age 19, Skarsgård applied to perform his national service. He served in the Swedish Navy&#x27;s &quot;SäkJakt&quot; (&quot;protect and hunt&quot;) unit that dealt with anti-sabotage and anti-terrorism in the Stockholm archipelago, for 18 months. After completing his service in 1996, he left Sweden and attended Leeds Metropolitan University in England for six months. He enrolled to study English but admits he did not study much and &quot;had a blast&quot; instead. While there, he considered pursuing an architecture career, but chose acting instead. In 1997, he enrolled in a theatre course at Marymount Manhattan College and moved to New York City. He returned to Stockholm after six months, but his time studying theatre confirmed to him that he wanted to act.

==Career==
===2001–2009: Career beginnings and television breakthrough===

On his return to Sweden, Skarsgård began landing roles in film, television and theatrical productions. While vacationing in the United States, he auditioned for and obtained the part of a mindless model in the 2001 film &quot;Zoolander&quot;, his first role in an American film. In 2003, his performance in &quot;Hundtricket-the Movie&quot; (&quot;The Dog Trick&quot;) earned him an &quot;Guldbagge Award&quot; nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He was named the Sexiest Man in Sweden five times.

He moved to Los Angeles in 2004 but continued to work in Sweden. His break came when he was cast as US Marine Brad Colbert in the HBO miniseries &quot;Generation Kill&quot;. An adaptation of journalist Evan Wright&#x27;s book of the same name, &quot;Generation Kill&quot; follows the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion of the United States Marine Corps during the early part of the Iraq War. Director Susanna White wanted to cast him, but executive producer David Simon was not convinced he could do a convincing American accent. After four auditions in three cities, Skarsgård learned the role was his just 36 hours before he had to board a plane for Namibia where the project was filming. The cast and crew spent seven months in the desert there, shooting six days a week. Skarsgård worked with a dialect coach to master the American accent.

Just before leaving to shoot &quot;Generation Kill&quot;, Skarsgård heard about the development of &quot;True Blood&quot;, an HBO series based on the &quot;Southern Vampire Mysteries&quot; novels by Charlaine Harris, which chronicle the coexistence of humans and vampires in a town in Louisiana. Though initially reluctant about playing a vampire, he sent an audition tape for the role of Bill Compton on learning that screenwriter Alan Ball was behind the project. Skarsgård had been a fan of Ball&#x27;s series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and film &quot;American Beauty&quot;. The role went to Stephen Moyer, but Skarsgård was cast as Eric Northman, a 1,000-year-old Nordic vampire. Northman first appeared in the first season&#x27;s fourth episode, and the role brought Skarsgård to prominence. To inform his portrayal, he studied the work of actors Max Schreck and Bela Lugosi and the film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. He said that playing Northman appealed to his preference for characters who were not simply diabolical or righteous. &quot;True Blood&quot; ran on HBO from 2008 to 2014, receiving mixed reviews.

In 2009, Skarsgård appeared in the music video for pop singer Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Paparazzi&quot;. He was the voice of Stefan in the 2009 animated film &quot;Metropia&quot;, directed by Tarik Saleh. In 2010, Skarsgård portrayed Terje, a gay Norwegian trekking to the North Pole, in the British mockumentary &quot;Beyond the Pole&quot;. Suit-maker Hickey Freeman chose Skarsgård to model a new look it debuted in 2010. Annie Leibovitz photographed the ad campaign, which appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal Magazine&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Details&quot;. Skarsgård appeared on the cover of the September 2010 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; with his &quot;True Blood&quot; co-stars Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer.

===2011–present: Film and television success===

In 2011, Skarsgård starred in &quot;Melancholia&quot;, a film directed by Lars von Trier. He portrayed a newlywed alongside Kirsten Dunst as his wife in the film, which premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and also co-stars his father. That same year, he appeared in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, a remake of the 1971 film of the same name, as Charlie Venner. The remake&#x27;s director, Rod Lurie, transferred the small town setting from Cornwall to Mississippi and described Venner as &quot;an ex-football star gone to seed&quot;. The film co-starred James Marsden and Kate Bosworth, and was released 16 September 2011.

In 2012, Skarsgård appeared alongside Taylor Kitsch and Rihanna in Peter Berg&#x27;s &quot;Battleship&quot;, an adaptation of the Hasbro game. Negatively reviewed by critics, the film had a dismal performance at the box office. He also appeared alongside Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan in Scott McGehee and David Siegel&#x27;s film &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot;, an adaptation of the Henry James novel of the same name. He was also part of the ensemble cast in Henry Alex Rubin&#x27;s thriller &quot;Disconnect&quot;, playing opposite Paula Patton. Skarsgård starred alongside Brit Marling and Elliot Page in Zal Batmanglij&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The East&quot;. He appeared in the film &quot;The Diary of a Teenage Girl&quot; as a man who begins an affair with his girlfriend&#x27;s underage daughter. It was released in August 2015. In addition to being intentional about finding nuances in the character&#x27;s predatory quality, Skarsgård admitted his excitement about playing the role &quot;without justifying or condoning&quot; his behavior. He starred in the 2016 film &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot;, portraying the title character, opposite Margot Robbie as Jane. Skarsgård worked out for 7 months to prepare for the part. The film did not generate success at the box office. It received mixed reviews, with Skarsgård&#x27;s performance garnering praise. He next portrayed a deviant policeman in the black comedy film &quot;War on Everyone&quot;, which was released that same year.
From 2017 to 2019, Skarsgård starred in the drama series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; as Perry Wright, an abusive husband to Nicole Kidman&#x27;s character, Celeste. He described his character as violent due to internal conflicts involving his insecurities about needing his wife. The series earned universal acclaim. Reviewing the first-season finale, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Daniel Fienberg found Skarsgård&#x27;s performance &quot;utterly chilling&quot;. Skarsgård won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie in 2017 for the role. He starred in the science fiction film &quot;Mute&quot; as a silent bartender in a futuristic society, which was released in February 2018. Later that year, he starred as a secretive man in &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot;, a miniseries that chronicles political violence in Europe in 1979. It received positive reviews. In 2019, he portrayed a sensitive German architect in &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, a film set in 1946 post-war Hamburg. He appeared in the romantic-comedy &quot;Long Shot&quot; as the prime minister of Canada. Critics were fond of the film, with &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Kristy Puchko commending Skarsgård in the minor role and how he &quot;makes a meal out of it&quot;. Released in May 2019, it had an unsuccessful commercial performance.

Skarsgård starred in &quot;The Stand&quot;, a CBS All Access miniseries based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Stephen King, portraying Randall Flagg, a charming demon. It ran from December 2020 to February 2021. He next starred in the 2021 monster film &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, which earned positive reviews and commercial success. Skarsgård recurred during the third season of the comedy-drama series &quot;Succession&quot; as tech mogul Lukas Matsson, for which he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. He portrayed Amleth in the epic film &quot;The Northman&quot;. Released in April 2022, the film garnered favorable reviews, with Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; deeming Skarsgård &quot;a fine vessel for the film&#x27;s opulent menace&quot;. In 2023, Skarsgård starred in the thriller &quot;Infinity Pool&quot;, and returned as Lukas Matsson for the fourth and final season of &quot;Succession&quot;. For his role as Matsson, Skarsgård was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2023.

==Personal life==
A football fan, Skarsgård supports Hammarby Fotboll, a club based in Stockholm, his birth city. In October 2010, he donated several autographed items to &quot;Bajen Aid&quot;, the club&#x27;s fundraising auction. In July 2011, he received an honorary degree from Leeds Metropolitan University, which he had attended. Skarsgård stated in 2018 that he is a feminist.

Skarsgård was the Ambassador for the American team for a Walking With The Wounded fundraising event for wounded soldiers. He trekked to the South Pole against Team UK (Prince Harry, Ambassador) and Team Canada/Australia (actor Dominic West, Ambassador). A few days into the trek, it was decided that the competition part would be cancelled due to hazardous terrain and weather conditions, so the teams combined forces and continued together, and all three successfully reached the South Pole on 13 December 2013.
Skarsgård is in a relationship with Swedish actress Tuva Novotny, and in 2022 the couple had their first child together.

<doc id="534624" wikidata="Q188080" url="?curid=534624" title="Arantxa Sánchez Vicario">
<text>Aránzazu Isabel María &quot;Arantxa&quot; Sánchez Vicario (; born 18 December 1971) is a Spanish former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 12 weeks, as well as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for 111 weeks. A defensive baseliner, Sánchez Vicario won 29 WTA Tour-level singles titles and 69 doubles titles, including 14 major titles: four in singles, six in women&#x27;s doubles, and four in mixed doubles. She also won four Olympic medals and five Fed Cup titles representing Spain. In 1994, Sánchez Vicario was crowned the ITF World Champion of the year.

==Career==
Arantxa Sánchez Vicario started playing tennis at the age of four, when she followed her older brothers Emilio Sánchez and Javier Sánchez (both of whom became professional players) to the court and hit balls against the wall with her first racquet. As a 17-year-old, she became the youngest winner of the women&#x27;s singles title at the 1989 French Open, defeating World No. 1 Steffi Graf in the final. (Monica Seles broke the record the following year when she won the title at age 16.)

Sánchez Vicario quickly developed a reputation on the tour for her tenacity and refusal to concede a point. Commentator Bud Collins described her as &quot;unceasing in determined pursuit of tennis balls, none seeming too distant to be retrieved in some manner and returned again and again to demoralize opponents&quot; and nicknamed her the &quot;Barcelona Bumblebee&quot;.

She won six women&#x27;s doubles Grand Slam titles, including the US Open in 1993 (with Helena Suková) and Wimbledon in 1995 (with Jana Novotná). She also won four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. In 1991, she helped Spain win its first-ever Fed Cup title, and helped Spain win the Fed Cup in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1998. Sánchez Vicario holds the records for the most matches won by a player in Fed Cup competition (72) and for most ties played (58). She was ITF world champion in 1994 in singles. She was also a member of the Spanish teams that won the Hopman Cup in 1990 and 2002.

Over the course of her career, she won 29 singles titles and 69 doubles titles before retiring in November 2002. She came out of retirement in 2004 to play doubles in a few select tournaments as well as the 2004 Summer Olympics, where she became the only tennis player to play in five Olympics in the Games&#x27; history. Sánchez Vicario was the most decorated Olympian in Spanish history with four medals—two silver and two bronze. Her medal count has since been surpassed by David Cal and Saúl Craviotto with five medals each.

In 2005, &quot;TENNIS &quot;magazine ranked her in 27th place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the &quot;TENNIS&quot; era and in 2007, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She was only the third Spanish player (and the first Spanish woman) to be inducted.

In 2009, Sánchez Vicario was present at the opening ceremony of Madrid&#x27;s Caja Mágica, the new venue for the Madrid Masters. The second show court is named Court Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in her honour.

==Personal life==
She has been married twice: her first marriage to the sports writer Juan Vehils in July 2000 ended in 2001. She then married businessman Josep Santacana in September 2008, with whom she has a daughter (born 2009) and son (born 2011). In 2019, Sánchez Vicario and Santacana divorced.

In 2012, Sánchez Vicario published an autobiography in which she claimed that, despite having earned $60 million over the course of her career, her parents had exerted almost total control over her finances and lost all of her money. The same year, Sánchez Vicario sued her father and older brother Javier for the alleged mishandling of her career earnings. The court case continued over three years and in 2015 concluded in a private settlement.

She has faced multiple court proceedings relating to charges of tax evasion and fraud. Between 1989 and 1993, she had falsely claimed to be resident of Andorra for tax purposes but was actually residing in Barcelona, Spain. As a result, she was ordered to pay back taxes and penalties. In 2009, Sánchez Vicario was found guilty of tax evasion and ordered to repay €3.5 million. In 2015, Banque de Luxembourg successfully filed complaint against her for credit and property fraud amounting to $5.2 million; however, they were unable to recoup it. In 2018, Sánchez Vicario was once again charged with fraud, for deliberately misleading the courts on her financial set-up during the previous case. As of 2021, Barcelona prosecutors are seeking a four-year jail term for Sánchez Vicario, due to further allegations of fraud relating to the transfer of assets to avoid paying her debts from a previous lawsuit. In 2024, she received a suspended sentence.

As well as tennis-playing siblings Javier and Emilio, Sánchez Vicario also has an older sister—Marisa—who briefly played professional tennis, peaking at world no. 368 in 1990.

<doc id="534636" wikidata="Q208667" url="?curid=534636" title="Stellan Skarsgård">
<text>Stellan John Skarsgård (, ; born 13 June 1951) is a Swedish actor. He is known for his collaborations with director Lars von Trier, appearing in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996), &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000), &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011), and &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; (2013). Skarsgård&#x27;s English-speaking film roles include &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; (1988), &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998), and &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004). 

Skarsgård has since starred in various blockbusters such as &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006) and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007). He also starred in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008), &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; (2009), David Fincher&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&quot; (2011). He played Dr. Erik Selvig in five Marvel Cinematic Universe films, starting with &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), and portrayed Baron Harkonnen in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s two-part &quot;Dune&quot; adaptation, &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024).

He is also known for his work in television portraying Boris Shcherbina in the HBO miniseries &quot;Chernobyl&quot; (2019), for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, and Luthen Rael in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; dystopian thriller series &quot;Andor&quot; (2022–present).

== Early life ==
Skarsgård was born in Gothenburg, the son of Gudrun (née Larsson; born 1930) and Jan Skarsgård (1920–1998). He moved often in his childhood and lived, amongst other places, in Helsingborg, Totebo, Kalmar, Marielund, and Uppsala.

== Acting career ==

Skarsgård started his acting career early; and, by the age of 21, his experience in film, TV and stage was considerable. Most of his early roles were in Swedish television (such as &quot;Bombi Bitt&quot;) and films. Of Skarsgård&#x27;s work in Swedish film, he is known for &quot;Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg&quot;, where he portrays Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who worked to save Holocaust victims.

Skarsgård is particularly associated with director Lars von Trier and has appeared in six of the Danish auteur&#x27;s features: &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;, &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Dogville&quot;, &quot;Melancholia&quot;, and &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;. His most personal working relationship, however, is with Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland, who has directed the actor in &quot;Zero Kelvin&quot;, &quot;Aberdeen&quot;, &quot;In Order of Disappearance&quot;, and &quot;A Somewhat Gentle Man&quot;. Skarsgård considers Moland a close friend and, in 2009, he said of their relationship: &quot;We&#x27;re like an old married couple and I get separation anxiety.&quot; Another Scandinavian work that he is known for is the 1997 Norwegian film &quot;Insomnia&quot;, in which he plays the guilt-ridden policeman Jonas Engström.

Skarsgård&#x27;s first American film was the 1985 film &quot;Noon Wine&quot;, directed by Michael Fields, in which Skarsgård played a mentally disturbed immigrant farmhand being chased by a bounty hunter. He acted opposite Fred Ward, who portrayed the farmer. In 1990, he starred in another American film, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, playing the character of Captain Tupolev, a Soviet submarine commander.

Primarily a character actor, he played one of Demi Moore&#x27;s two love interests in &quot;Passion of Mind&quot; (2000), directed by Alain Berliner. Skarsgård appeared as a guest star on &quot;Entourage&quot; as Verner Vollstedt, the German director of the fictional film &quot;Smokejumpers&quot;, who is hostile to the main character Vincent Chase. Skarsgård appeared as Bootstrap Bill Turner in both &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;. In 2008, he starred as Bill Anderson in Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; and reprised the role 10 years later in its sequel &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot;.

Skarsgård played Dr. Erik Selvig in the 2011 film &quot;Thor&quot;, and later reprised the role in &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2022), as well as &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and &quot;&quot; (2015). Skarsgård reteamed with &quot;Thor&quot; director Kenneth Branagh for the 2015 live-action adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;, in which he played The Grand Duke. In 2021, he played Vladimir Harkonnen in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;. Skarsgård also co-starred alongside his son Gustaf Skarsgård in the Swedish psychological thriller &quot;What Remains&quot; (2022)&quot;.&quot;

Skarsgård has appeared in music videos alongside fellow Swedes. He was in Eva Dahlgren&#x27;s &quot;Vem tänder stjärnorna&quot; (Who Lights the Stars) in 1991 and Lykke Li&#x27;s 2011 music video, &quot;Sadness Is a Blessing&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In April 1975, Skarsgård married Swedish doctor, My (born 1956). Before divorcing My in 2007, they had six children together: Alexander (born 1976), Gustaf (born 1980), Sam (born 1982), Bill (born 1990), Eija (born 1992), and Valter (born 1995). Alexander, Gustaf, Bill, and Valter are also actors, while Eija was a model for a few years. Skarsgård married Irish screenwriter and producer Megan Everett in January 2009. They have two sons together. In 2016, Skarsgård revealed that he had a vasectomy because he felt that eight children was enough. Seven of his children are active in film and television; the eighth is a doctor.

== Religious beliefs ==
Skarsgård was brought up by humanist, atheist parents, and had an atheist grandfather and a deeply religious grandmother. According to Skarsgård, this never led to any problems because of the family&#x27;s mutual respect for each other&#x27;s opinions. After the September 11 attacks, Skarsgård set out to read the Bible and the Quran, both of which he condemns as violent. Skarsgård is also a critic of religious independent schools in the Swedish educational system. He has said he considers the question of God&#x27;s existence to be &quot;absurd and completely uninteresting&quot; since if a benevolent God were to exist he would judge only a person&#x27;s deeds and not care for worship, but if God were actually so vain as to constantly demand worship, then he would not be worthy of it.

In 2009, Skarsgård, along with other non-religious artists, authors, and entrepreneurs including Christer Sturmark, Björn Ulvaeus, and Christer Fuglesang, wrote an article in &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; stressing the importance of secularity. The group also criticised the UN for its stance on blasphemy laws.

== Political views ==

Skarsgård has voiced support for Swedish tax policies, and for a high income tax rate for high earners.

Skarsgård is avowedly anti-nationalist.

<doc id="534640" wikidata="Q5194615" url="?curid=534640" title="Curate's egg">
<text>A &quot;curate&#x27;s egg&quot; is something described as partly bad and partly good. In its original usage, it referred to something that is obviously and entirely bad, but is described out of politeness as nonetheless having good features that redeem it. This meaning has been largely supplanted by its less ironic modern usage, which refers to something that is in fact an indeterminate mix of good and bad, possibly with a preponderance of bad qualities.

==History==
The expression is pre-dated by an anecdote in the 1875 &quot;Our Bishops and Deans&quot; by the Reverend F. Arnold, referenced in an issue of &quot;The Academy: A Weekly Review of Literature, Science, and Art:&quot; &quot;Without pledging our credence, we could afford a grin to the story of the &#x27;young Levite&#x27; who at a bishop&#x27;s breakfast-table, was so as to decline the replacement of a bad egg by a good one with a &#x27;No thank you, my Lord, it&#x27;s good enough for me&#x27;.&quot;
In May 1895, the satirical British magazine &quot;Judy&quot; published a cartoon by artist Wilkerson, showing a timid curate and a fierce-looking bishop at breakfast in the bishop&#x27;s house. The bishop says, &quot;Dear me, I&#x27;m afraid your egg&#x27;s not good!&quot; The curate, desperate not to offend his host and superior, replies, &quot;Oh, yes, my Lord, really – er – some parts of it are good.&quot; In November that year, the magazine &quot;Punch&quot; (which had a much wider circulation than &quot;Judy&quot;) published a similar cartoon by staff illustrator George du Maurier. Titled &quot;True Humility&quot;, it also pictures a timid-looking curate eating breakfast with his bishop, though in this case with others at the table and servants shown in the background. The bishop says: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve got a bad egg, Mr Jones.&quot; The curate replies: &quot;Oh no, my Lord, I assure you! Parts of it are excellent!&quot; An editor at &quot;Judy&quot; accused &quot;Punch&quot; of plagiarism, saying in an editorial, &quot;anyone can see the coincidence for themselves&quot;. This version of the gag has become the best known.

For the final issue of &quot;Punch&quot;, published in 1992, an artist, Tony Hannan, redrew the du Maurier cartoon, with the curate simply saying, &quot;This f***ing egg&#x27;s bad!&quot;

&quot;The Economist&quot; Style Guide of 2018 cites the curate&#x27;s egg in its entry for the connotations of &#x27;good in parts&#x27;. It states: &quot;good in parts is what the curate said about an egg that was wholly bad. He was trying to be polite.&quot;

<doc id="534649" wikidata="Q939640" url="?curid=534649" title="Citroën BX">
<text>The Citroën BX is a large family car which was produced by the French manufacturer Citroën from 1982 to 1994. In total, 2,315,739 BXs were built during its 12-year history. The hatchback was discontinued in 1993 with the arrival of the Xantia, but the estate continued for another year. The BX was designed to be lightweight, using particularly few body parts, including many made from plastics.

== History ==

The Citroën BX was announced in June 1982, but its commercial life really only began in the Autumn of that year, with a Paris presentation on 2 October 1982 under the Eiffel Tower. The BX was designed to replace the successful small family car Citroën GS/GSA that was launched in 1970, with a larger vehicle (although the GSA continued until 1986). The French advertising campaign used the slogan &quot;J&#x27;aime, j&#x27;aime, j&#x27;aime&quot; showing the car accompanied by music written specially by Julien Clerc. The British advertising campaign used the slogan &quot;Loves Driving, Hates Garages&quot;, reflecting the effort of Citroën to promote the reduced maintenance costs of the BX, over the higher than average maintenance costs of the technologically advanced GS/GSA; while still performing in the Citroën style on the road.

The angular hatchback was designed by Marcello Gandini of Bertone, based on his unused design for the British 1977 Reliant FW11 concept and his 1979 Volvo Tundra concept car. It was the second car to benefit from the merger of Peugeot and Citroën in 1976, the first being the Citroën Visa launched in 1978. The BX shared its platform with the more conventional 405 that appeared in 1987, except the rear suspension which is from a Peugeot 305 Break. Among the features that set the car apart from the competition was the traditional Citroën hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension, extensive use of plastic body panels (bonnet, tailgate, bumpers), and front and rear disc brakes.

The BX was launched onto the right-hand drive UK market in August 1983, initially only with 1.4 and 1.6 petrol engines, although by 1986 it had been joined by more engine options as well as a five-door estate model. The BX enjoyed a four-year run as the UK&#x27;s best selling diesel engine car from 1987, and was one of the most popular foreign-built cars there during the second half of the 1980s. However, just 485 examples were remaining on Britain&#x27;s roads by February 2016.

The BX dispensed with the air cooled, flat four engine which powered the GS, and replaced it with the new PSA group XY, TU and XU series of petrol engines in 1360 cc, 1580 cc and, from 1984, 1905 cc displacements. A 1124 cc engine, very unusual in a car of this size, was also available in countries where car tax was a direct function of engine capacity, such as Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Greece. The 1.1 and 1.4 models used the PSA X engine (known widely as the &quot;Douvrin&quot; or &quot;Suitcase Engine&quot;), the product of an earlier Peugeot/Renault joint venture, and already fitted in the Peugeot 104 and Renault 14. The 1.6 version was the first car to use the all-new short-stroke XU-series engine. It was produced in a new engine plant at Trémery built specifically for this purpose, and was later introduced in a larger 1.9-litre version and saw long service in a variety of Peugeots and Citroëns. The XUD diesel engine version was launched in November 1983. The diesel and turbo diesel models were to become the most successful variants, they were especially popular as estates and became the best selling diesel car in Britain in the late 1980s. 

The petrol engines were badged as 11, 14, 16, 19 — signifying engine size (with the exception of the 17 diesel model, which was actually a 1769 cc, 1.8-liter unit). In some countries, a weaker, DIN version of the 1.6 L engine was badged as the BX15 instead of BX16. The 11TE model was seen by foreign motoring press as slow and uncomfortable. The 1.1 L engine with engine code H1A was installed in the BX for the Italian, Greek, and Portuguese markets specifically. It was fitted from 1988 to 1993 and produces DIN at 5800 rpm.

A year after the launch of the hatchback model, an estate version (&quot;Break&quot;, &quot;Evasion&quot;) was made available. The Breaks were all built by Heuliez at their recently updated plant in Cerizay. In 1984 power steering became optional, welcome particularly in the diesel models. In the late 1980s, a four-wheel drive system and turbodiesel engines were introduced.

The majority of BX built received a five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic by ZF was introduced as an option on the 16 RS and TRS in July 1984, and added to the 19 TRD in February 1986. In July 1988, the automatic became an available option on the 19 GTI and the TRi/TZi Break (the precise models vary in some markets).
===Phase II (1986)===
In 1986 the Phase II BX was launched. The interior and dashboard were redesigned to be more conventional-looking than the original, which used Citroën&#x27;s idiosyncratic &quot;satellite&quot; switchgear, and &quot;bathroom scale&quot; speedometer. These were replaced with more conventional stalks for light and wipers and analogue instruments. The earlier GT (and Sport) models already had a &quot;normal&quot; speedometer and tachometer. The exterior was also slightly updated, with new more rounded bumpers, flared wheelarches to accept wider tyres, new and improved mirrors and the front indicators replaced with larger clear ones which fitted flush with the headlights. The elderly Douvrin engine was replaced by the newer TU-series engine on the 1.4 litre models, although it continued to be installed in the tiny BX11 until 1992.

1988 saw the launch of the BX Turbo Diesel, which was praised by the motoring press. The BX diesel was already a strong seller, but the Turbo model brought new levels of refinement and performance to the diesel market, which brought an end to the common notion that diesel cars were slow and noisy. Diesel Car magazine said of the BX &quot;We can think of no other car currently on sale in the UK that comes anywhere near approaching the BX Turbo&#x27;s combination of performance, accommodation and economy&quot;.

===Phase II facelift (1989)===
In 1989, the BX range had further minor revisions and specification improvements made to it, including smoked rear lamp units, new wheel trims and interior fabrics.

Winning many Towcar of the Year awards, the BX was renowned as a tow car (as was its larger sister, the CX), especially the diesel models, due to their power and economy combined with the self levelling suspension.

The biggest problem of the BX was its variable build quality, compared to its competition. In 1983, one quarter of the production needed &quot;touchups&quot; before they could be shipped. Later models were better built, but the reputation had been tarnished. It had been partially replaced by the smaller ZX in early 1991, but its key replacement was the slightly larger Xantia that went on sale at the beginning of 1993, when the BX hatchback was discontinued, although the estate models lasted into the following year, when the estate version of the Xantia was launched.

==Performance models==

===Sport===

As well as the normal BX, Citroën produced the BX Sport from 1985 to 1987. During this period, Citroën produced 7,500 BX Sports; 2,500 in the first series, then an extra 5,000 due to its sales success. Rated at at 5800 rpm and equipped with dual twin-barrel carburettors, the BX Sport was the most powerful BX in production at that time. The engine modifications, including a reshaped combustion chamber and larger valves, were developed by famous French tuner Danielson. It also stood out with its unique body kit, alloy wheels later also used on the GTi, a unique dashboard and Pullman interior. The seat fabric was the same as that used on the CX Turbo at the time. The body kit included a rear wing, side skirts, and fender extensions that added 10 cm to each side of the car in order to accommodate the larger wheels. The car was only available in LHD and was not sold in the United Kingdom. Period road tests complimented the ride quality (as usual with Citroëns) but complained that the driving characteristics were not all that sporty as a result, even though the suspension had also been modified.

===GT===

The BX GT was launched in 1985 and featured a 1.9 L Peugeot-sourced engine, in general a Sport engine with only one twin choke carburettor. Max power is . That same year, Citroën produced a &quot;Digit&quot; model, which was based on the BX GT. It featured a digital instrument cluster and an onboard computer. Citroën only produced 4,000 BX Digits in 1985.

===4TC===

Citroën entered Group B rallying with the BX in 1986. The specially designed rally BX was called the BX 4TC and bore little resemblance to the standard BX. It had a very long nose because the engine (a turbocharger fitted version of Chrysler Europe&#x27;s Simca Type 180 engine) was mounted longitudinally, unlike in the regular BX. The engine was downsized to 2,141.5 cc (from 2,155 cc) to stay under the three-litre limit after FIA&#x27;s multiplication factor of 1.4 was applied. The rally version of the BX also featured the unique hydropneumatic suspension, and the five-speed manual gearbox from the Citroën SM. The rear axle was from the rear-wheel drive Peugeot 505, with a carbon fibre prop shaft. Because of the Group B regulations, 200 street versions of the 4TC also had to be built, with a at 5,250 rpm version of the N9TE engine.
The 4TC was not successful in World Rally Championship competition, its best result being a sixth place in the 1986 Swedish Rally. The 4TC only participated in three rallies before the Group B class was banned in late 1986, following the death of Henri Toivonen in his Lancia Delta S4 at the Tour de Corse Rally. Aside from being overweight and with bad weight distribution, the BX 4TC also suffered from restricted suspension travel compared to the competition and did not feature a central differential, meaning that the front and rear axle were usually struggling against each other - limiting the cars effectiveness on tarmac in particular.

Already discouraged by the car&#x27;s poor performance in motorsport and the demise of Group B, Citroën was only able to sell 62 roadgoing 4TCs; build quality and reliability problems led Citroën to buy back many of these 4TCs for salvage and destruction. With only a fraction of the original 200 examples remaining, the 4TC is now highly sought after. While a few privateers continued to campaign the BX 4TC Evolution in the French rallycross championships, Citroën pressured them to stop and by 1989 the competition history of the BX 4TC came to a final end.

===GTi===

An uprated version of the BX GT, the BX19 GTi was fitted with a 1.9 L eight-valve fuel injected engine producing (this engine also fitted to the Peugeot 405 SRi, and being very similar to the engine also fitted to the 205 GTi, however the BX19 GTi and Peugeot 405 SRi used a different inlet manifold and cylinder head to the Peugeot 205 GTi), a spoiler and firmer suspension spheres/anti-roll bar than the standard model; it could reach 198 km/h. There was also a special export model, the BX16 GTi, using the XU5JA engine from the Peugeot 205 GTi 1.6. Top speed is .

===16V===

In May 1987, a 16-valve version of the GTi was launched. This was the first mass-produced French car to be fitted with a 16-valve engine. A DOHC twin-exhaust port cylinder head, based on that of the Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 Group B rally car was bolted to an uprated version of the 1905 cc XU9 8v alloy engine block as fitted to the BX GTi and Peugeot 205 GTi. The result was the XU9J4; a naturally aspirated 1.9 L engine, (also fitted to the phase 1 Peugeot 405 Mi16) producing and of torque. More specifically, it produced a specific output of 84 bhp/litre, which for a fixed cam-timing, naturally aspirated engine was fairly impressive at the time. This helped &quot;rocket&quot; the BX to in 7.6 seconds (0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 7.4 seconds) and then in 19.9 seconds before then finally stopping at a top speed of . Anti-lock brakes were fitted as standard. Its side skirts made it easily recognizable from all other BX models. In 1990, the facelift of the 16V gave the car a new lease of life. The updated car came with new fibreglass bumpers, anthracite painted wheels, smoked taillight lenses, and a redesigned rear spoiler. These cosmetic changes made the car look even more distinctive from other BXs. There were also a few subtle changes made to the car&#x27;s performance, the most noticeable being harder suspension and a thicker anti-roll bar, which improved handling.

The BX 16V was found to be faster around a race-track than the &quot;in house&quot; competitor Peugeot 405 Mi16 in a test in the Swedish motoring magazine &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot;. Also in Sweden, young driver Magnus Gustafsson competed successfully in rally with a group A tuned BX 16V. The engine produced and Gustafsson was second in the Swedish International Rally 1993 in the A7 category.

==BX Van==

A version of the BX with an extended fiberglass roof and no rear seat called the BX Van was produced in Finland. At the time vans had to pay a smaller registration tax than passenger cars so people wanted to be able to register the BX as a van. The regular BX estate couldn&#x27;t be registered as a van in Finland because Finnish law required vans to have a cargo space at least 130 centimeters high and 2.5m3 in cargo volume, lengthwise measured awkwardly from inner boot lid to the bottom of steering wheel. The higher roof was achieved by cutting off the original steel roof and replacing it with a large box made of fiberglass. The BX Van was quite popular and over 2000 of them were sold.

A different van version was marketed in Ireland. This was directly based upon the shape of the estate but with rear doors and windows removed.

<text>The Sheesh Mahal (; &quot; &quot;The Palace of Mirrors&quot;&quot;) is a palace located within the Shah Burj block at the north-western corner of Lahore Fort. It was constructed under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631–32, with later additions made under Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The ornate white marble pavilion is inlaid with pietra dura and intricate mirror work of the finest quality. The hall was reserved for personal use of the imperial family and their close aides. It is among the 21 monuments that were built by successive Mughal emperors inside Lahore Fort, and forms the &quot;jewel in the Fort’s crown.&quot; As part of the larger Lahore Fort Complex, it has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981.

==Etymology==

&quot;Sheesh Mahal&quot;, in Urdu language, literally means &#x27;Crystal Palace&#x27;. However, with its pietra dura decorations and intricate mirror-work inlaid into the white marble walls and ceilings creating gleaming effect, the lavish room has come to be known as &#x27;Palace of Mirrors&#x27;, and sometimes the &#x27;Hall of Mirrors&#x27;. Similar halls are also found in the contemporary palace of the Agra Fort, and show influence on the later additions to Amber Fort.

==History==

The solid brick foundations of Lahore Fort were laid in 1566 under the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar the Great on the location of an earlier mud-fort. To build the new fort, the Emperor brought experienced artisans after the completion of Fatehpur Sikri. Later, Shah Jahan converted the fort into a pleasure resort and added Diwan-i-Khas, Moti Masjid, Naulakha Pavilion, sleeping chambers, and Sheesh Mahal in to the complex. Sheesh Mahal is located within the &quot;Shah Burj&quot; (King&#x27;s Pavilion) block that was actually built by his predecessor Jahangir. The chamber was exclusively used for private council meetings as part of the daily routine of the emperor, whereas the whole block was only accessible to the imperial princes, the vizier, and selected courtiers. The extension work of private quarters by Shah Jahan continued between 1628 and 1634. The distinctive Shah Jahani architecture is reflected in the extensive use of white marble and hierarchical accents of the construction. During the Sikh Empire, &quot;Shah Burj&quot; became Ranjit Singh&#x27;s favourite place. He built a harem over the top of Sheesh Mahal. Kangra style frescoes were also added during his reign, and the original entrance to the Sheesh Mahal quadrangle was closed off and the Athdara built in its place. This was also the place where he used to display his prized possession, the Koh-i-Noor.

==Design==
The Sheesh Mahal was built by Emperor Shah Jahan. It was built in the middle of Jahangir&#x27;s rule. The façade, consisting of five cusped marble arches supported by coupled columns, opens into the courtyard. The engrailed spandrels and bases are inlaid with precious stones. The pavilion is in the form of a semi-octagon, and consists of apartments roofed with gilded cupolas and intricately decorated with pietra dura and convex glass and mirror mosaic (&quot;ayina kari&quot;) with thousands of small mirrors. At night they light candles. The decorative features also include stucco tracery (&quot;munabat kari&quot;) and carved marble screens in geometrical and tendril designs. The roof of the central hall rises up to two storeys. The hall was originally decorated with fresco paintings that were later replaced with glass mosaic in different colours.

==Conservation==

The additional constructions carried out during the subsequent Sikh and British rules of Punjab on the top of Sheesh Mahal added to the dead load that made the structure vulnerable to collapse. In 1904–05, the plaster from the ceiling of main veranda fell apart, exposing the decay of internal wooden beams and the corroding roof. At this stage, the building was listed by the department of archaeology of British India in 1927 and the repair work was carried out. Similar problems arose in 1960s and were resolved through minor repairs. In 1975, Sheesh Mahal was listed as a protected monument under the Antiquities Act by Pakistan&#x27;s Department of Archaeology whereas in 1981, as part of the larger Lahore Fort Complex, it became inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was not until 2006 that the problems of the ceiling were comprehensively resolved and the structure was restored.

<text>The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC; Chinese: ) is the statutory independent anti-corruption body of Hong Kong with the primary objective of combating corruption in both the public and private sectors. Established in 1974 and operating independently from the Hong Kong government and law enforcement agencies, the ICAC is headed by the Commissioner, who reports directly to the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The ICAC has played a crucial role in maintaining Hong Kong&#x27;s reputation as one of the least corrupt places globally and fostering a culture of integrity within the city.

The ICAC&#x27;s functions encompass investigation, prevention, and education. It investigates complaints of corruption-related offenses, conducts operations to uncover corrupt practices, and has the authority to arrest, search, and seize property. In addition, the ICAC works on preventing corruption by reviewing and improving systems and procedures in government departments, public bodies, and private organizations, while also offering advice and assistance in implementing effective anti-corruption measures. The ICAC also engages in public education and awareness campaigns to raise ethical standards in the community and encourage the public to report corruption.

The Article 57 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong stipulates that the ICAC shall operate independently and be directly accountable to the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. By the Article 48, the Commissioner of the ICAC, being as a principal official of Hong Kong, is nominated by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong and appointed by the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Background ==
As Hong Kong recovered after World War II, the population began to swell and manufacturing industries grew. By the 1960s Hong Kong was experiencing economic growth, yet the government kept civil servants&#x27; salaries very low. Officials in all departments took advantage of their positions to supplement their wages with demands for &quot;tea money,&quot; &quot;lucky money,&quot; or substantially larger sums. Examples of corruption ranged from nursing sisters demanding money to provide services such as extra blankets, food or to allow visitors outside normal hours; firemen lived by the saying, &quot;冇錢，冇水&quot; (&quot;No money, no water&quot;) and sometimes asked for money to turn off the water, preventing water damage, once a fire had been put out; officials in Lands and Public Works departments secured huge sums of money for &quot;advice&quot; and &quot;signatures&quot; that procured the award of tenders and enabled developments and projects to proceed; the Royal Hong Kong Police organised entire stations to &quot;make money&quot; from hawkers, licences, and in many other illicit schemes. Civil servants often had to pay for promotions and postings in positions known for a lucrative return.

The Hong Kong Police Force previously had an Anti-Corruption Branch, but it did little to reduce corruption in February 1952. Public perception was that Anti-Corruption police, following the discovery of corrupt practices, would then enter into the dealings themselves. One example was Peter Godber, a senior officer stationed at Wan Chai Police Station and later at Kai Tak Airport police station. Before his retirement in 1973, he had amassed at least 4.3 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 600,000 US dollars) in overseas bank accounts. The police&#x27;s Anti-Corruption Branch investigated his wealth and ordered him to explain his source of income. In response, Godber immediately arranged for his wife to leave the colony, then used his police airport pass to bypass Immigration and Passport checks and walked onto a plane for London. Godber&#x27;s escape led to a large public outcry over the integrity and quality of the police&#x27;s self-investigation and called for reforms in the government&#x27;s anti-corruption efforts. Godber was later extradited back to Hong Kong to face trial and was convicted.

Singapore&#x27;s approach in fighting corruption by relying on an Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) via Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) was adopted by Hong Kong on 15 February 1974 after a study team of Hong Kong civil servants visited Singapore and Sri Lanka in 1968 to study their anti corruption laws.

The newly formed Independent Commission Against Corruption would be answerable to only the Governor of Hong Kong, unlike the old police Anti-Corruption Branch. Most ICAC operations staff were sergeants recruited from specifically British police forces and were certainly not beyond sharp practices themselves. Their tactics and methods were often aggressive—they would go to a police station and take an entire shift in for questioning as a &quot;fishing exercise.&quot; Ultimately their shock tactics were effective.

==Development==
In the early days there were running punch-ups between ICAC officers and angry policemen who stormed their offices in Central District; this situation ended only with the announcement of a partial amnesty for minor corruptions committed before 1977. But gradually, the ICAC made itself felt and several high-profile police officers were tried and convicted. Others were forced to retire. As a result of its investigations, a mass purge took place in early 1978, where it was announced that 119 officers including one customs official were asked to leave under the provisions of Colonial Regulation 55 (see footnote 1 below) to fast track the decisions in the public interest; a further 24 officers were held on conspiracy charges, and 36 officers and a customs official were given amnesties. The move received a mixed response from the public whilst being broadly supported by legislative councillors as being in the best interests of Hong Kong not to let the affair fester and further demoralise the police Force. Urban Council member Elsie Elliot criticised the government for being lenient to senior corrupt officials, punishing only &quot;small flies.&quot;

Gradually, Hong Kong transformed from a graft-ridden city into one of the least corrupt places in the world, as recognised by international institutions such as the World Bank, The Heritage Foundation and Transparency International. Some countries have looked to the ICAC as an effective model of combating graft holistically through detection, prevention, and education.

In the 1970s, eight out of 10 graft complaints were against public officers. This trend has reversed over the years. Complaints against police officers reduced by 70 percent—from 1,443 in 1974 to 446 in 2007. Nowadays, only three out of 10 complaints relate to public servants. Private sector cases meanwhile have been on the rise in recent years. The ICAC has stepped up efforts to help enterprises minimise corruption risks through system controls and staff training. (The statistics are provided by the ICAC.)

In the late 1980s, the Acting Crown Prosecutor, Charles Warwick Reid, was arrested for taking bribes to throw trials. He was subsequently convicted. He did not take up his post as Director of New Zealand&#x27;s new Serious Fraud Office. His eight-year sentence was reduced to six years when he turned informer. He spent his time in witness protection, the first three years in solitary confinement, and on his release was returned to his native New Zealand. Within a couple of days he had made a false affidavit for a Chinese businessman standing trial in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities wanted him extradited, but he was instead tried in New Zealand and sentenced to two years. He, his wife and his solicitor became the defendants in a landmark Privy Council case on tracing bribe money in 1993, when the Attorney-General of Hong Kong sought to obtain unpaid fines of $12,000,000 by claims on land Reid bought in the New Zealand seaside town of Tauranga.

In 2008, corruption reports received by the ICAC dropped six per cent to 3,377, of which 65 per cent were related to the private sector, 28 per cent concerned government departments, and the remaining seven per cent were against public bodies.

Research on corruption—carried out by the Anti Corruption Resource Centre—shows that police corruption in Hong Kong was frequently associated with &quot;illegal markets&quot; or &quot;victimless crimes&quot; such as gambling, prostitution and drugs. Thus, the decision to legalise off-course betting in Hong Kong—a previously rich source of police bribes—may plausibly have contributed to the fall in police corruption. The investigative, preventive, and educational activities of the ICAC no doubt also had some impact but were not solely or even largely responsible for reducing police corruption.

==Controversies==
After the big purges of the 1970s, many thought that the ICAC would take a reduced role in society, but despite the fact that their main job was done their influence remained pervasive. Short of voluminous numbers of dramatic cases many ICAC officers left Hong Kong, others remained to enjoy a less taxing life. However, in 1993 their deputy director of Operations Alex Tsui Ka-kit was suddenly sacked by Governor Chris Patten, who stated that he had &quot;lost confidence&quot; in Tsui—a euphemism that strong evidence of corruption or significant wrongdoing existed. The &quot;Alex Tsui Affair&quot; caused a huge stir in the mid-1990s as Tsui did not go quietly. Indeed, he made counter-allegations of misconduct within the ICAC, one of which was that Director of Operations Jim Buckle had &quot;squashed&quot; an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment by an officer called Michael Croft (who was later transferred and forced out of the service). Alex Tsui&#x27;s continued rantings in the media and Legislative Council did little for the image of ICAC.

A year later at Christmas 1995, an ICAC assistant director—a well-known carouser—was arrested for drinking and driving. Following conviction he mysteriously avoided strong punishment and received only a &quot;reprimand&quot; from the Commissioner of the ICAC.

On 31 October 2006, Fanny Law was appointed Commissioner of the ICAC. The unpopular Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower was seen as being weak on security-related issues. In addition, as Law&#x27;s and former Commissioner Raymond Wong&#x27;s appointments were a direct swap, the government was derided by the Civic Party and Liberal Party for belittling an important position by playing &quot;musical chairs.&quot; Law was not perceived to be at the end of her civil service career, while the post of Commissioner was traditionally a &#x27;final&#x27; posting, allowing the official to work without fear or favour.

=== Expenses scandal ===
In 2013, Timothy Tong was found to have overspent on entertaining and gifts for mainland and other overseas officials during his 5-year tenure as Commissioner. An independent committee found that he had authorised entertaining expenses at banquets that exceeded internal guidelines. There was an example of an airline upgrade for two officers to business class costing HK186,000 that had no record of approval, and one gift costing HK$4,140 ($530) that had been reportedly offered to a senior mainland official. Tong was criticised by a Legislative Council committee for his 35 work trips which cost taxpayers almost HK$4 million ($513,000) and gifts to both mainland and overseas officials costing HK$282,000 ($36,100). The LegCo committee expressed its concern as to &quot;whether Mr Tong had thoroughly considered that unduly close contacts between him and mainland officials in Hong Kong during his tenure might have shaken public confidence in the impartiality of the ICAC.&quot; Tong had recently been appointed delegate to the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference when the scandal broke. Chief Secretary Carrie Lam admitted that the controversy surrounding the over-expenditures &quot;inevitably undermined the ICAC&#x27;s image and Hong Kong&#x27;s reputation as a corruption-free society.&quot;

=== Concerns over independence ===
Several high-level appointments since the transfer of sovereignty have brought the independence of the ICAC into question. Simon Peh, an Immigration Department bureaucrat, was appointed Commissioner in 2012. More importantly, in 2014, Maria Tam, former colonial loyalist who rapidly switched allegiance to Beijing after 1997, was named head of the Operations Review Committee – a key board that has power to question any decision of the ICAC and to drop any case.

Further erosion of independence was feared when Rebecca Li Bo-lan – a 30-year veteran graft-buster and the first female head of the ICAC investigative unit, appointed in June 2015 – was abruptly removed from her job in an unprecedented manner, and no explanation has been forthcoming from the ICAC. Pan-democratic politicians accused chief executive CY Leung of interfering because he is the subject of an anti-graft probe over a HK$50 million payment Leung received from Australian firm UGL. Democratic-camp legislators made allegations, citing internal ICAC sources, that Leung&#x27;s office had been uncooperative and also impeding the progress of investigations into his own case; the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office rebutted the claim.

==Impact==
For the private sector, the establishment of ICAC reorganised the corruption morale of the private sector which they started to alter the importance of integrity. ICAC also offered a channel for people to report on the corruption cases which led to an upsurge in corruption reports. The situation in the banking sector was the most significant and affected many banking officers. It also revealed that the issue of corruption was deeply-rooted in this sector, even in some major banks. The corruption problems were kept in silence and being ignored. Besides, after the report of corruption cases, the management team in the sector started to internalise and execute rules and policies in combating the corruption which turned the prevention into internal issues. This led to a decrease in reporting corruption cases afterwards.

==Constitutionality==
In preparation for transfer of Hong Kong&#x27;s sovereignty in 1997, the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China enacted the Hong Kong Basic Law in 1990, providing for the establishment of a &quot;Commission Against Corruption.&quot; This anti-graft agency thus exists as a constitutionally sanctioned body.

==Covert surveillance==
In 2005, the evidence collected by the ICAC through covert surveillance in a case involving a publicly listed company was questioned. While the judge ruled that covert surveillance carried out in this case was unconstitutional due to the absence of relevant legal procedures, the judge admitted the evidence as he found that the ICAC had conducted the operations in good faith. The defendants were convicted.

To address the lack of legal procedures that govern covert surveillance by law enforcement agencies, as required by the Basic Law, the Legislative Council passed the Interception of Communication and Surveillance Ordinance (ICSO) in August 2006 to provide for such procedures. All covert surveillance operations of the ICAC are now carried out strictly in accordance with the ICSO, which applies to all law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong.

An assistant ICAC investigator was jailed for nine months on 4 April 2003 for lying in a court trial, to conceal the fact that he had threatened a suspect to co-operate with a probe by ICAC. So far, this is the only case of such a nature in ICAC history.

==Organisation==
The independence of the organisation is assured by its three pillars – Head of Operations, the Commissioner and Operations Review Committee (ORC). The Operations Department is accountable not to the Commissioner, but the ORC comprising largely members of the public appointed by the Chief Executive.

===Commissioner===
The Commissioner is the public face of the ICAC, and is mainly responsible for policy, public image and international relations. Although generally considered the top official in the organisation, the Commissioner generally has little knowledge of specific investigations until their final stages, adhering to the ICAC&#x27;s &quot;need-to- know&quot; principle, which has acted as a de facto separation of functions since it was founded in the 1970s.

The current Commissioner, the 15th, is Simon Peh. He was appointed in 2012 and is the body&#x27;s longest-serving head to date.

===Divisions===

The ICAC has three divisions: Operations, Community Relations, and Corruption Prevention. The Operations Department is the largest by far, having 72 percent of the staff, and is responsible for all the high-profile busts. The person in charge of the Operations Department is appointed by the Chief Executive and not by the ICAC Commissioner. By custom and practice, the Head of Operations is usually bestowed the title of Deputy Commissioner. Currently headed by Ricky Yau Shu-chun, this department considers itself all powerful, and has apparently resisted all attempts to interfere with its investigations. The investigation into circulation fraud by Sally Aw at &quot;The Standard&quot; has been cited as an example of the embarrassment caused by such non-co-operation with the government hierarchy.

===Witness Protection and Firearms Section===

ICAC maintains a small specialised unit, namely the Witness Protection and Firearms Section (R4), which carry out high risk operations (such as pursuits and conducting house raids), forced entry, witness protection, and training of new recruits in basic firearms skills since 1998.

To be the member of R4, investigators have to undergo a battery of physical, written, and psychometric tests, and receive a three-phase training if they are selected, which involves multiple tactics in witness protection, firearms and more.

Up to now, no shots were fired by R4 during missions and the unit remains a good reputation.

== Colonial Regulation 55 ==

Colonial Regulation 55 was an executive provision of the highest order for which the colonial Government was not obliged to give cause. It stipulated that &quot;An officer holds office subject to the pleasure of the Crown, and the pleasure of the Crown that he may no longer hold it may be signified through the Secretary of State, in which case no special formalities are required.&quot;

As a safeguard for this regulation, action must be taken by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in London after review by the Secretary of the Civil Service and the Attorney General for England and Wales. The highest authority would have been the Lord Chancellor.

This regulation was invoked approximately 25 times by the colonial Government up to 1978, twice of which was during the tenure of Governor MacLehose.

Henry Litton, Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, questioned the use of Regulation 55, when Regulations 56 and 57 (which provide for &quot;dismissal after due enquiry&quot; before a judge) could have been used. He furthermore said &quot;As far as I know, Colonial Regulations apply to only sovereign gazetted officers,&quot; and that &quot;no Chinese policeman has ever been given a copy...before signing on.&quot; Most Legislators supported the move as being under &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; and &quot;necessary.&quot;

The Colonial Regulation was replaced by the Public Service Order after Hong Kong&#x27;s transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997.

==Information technology==
ICAC commissioner Dr Timothy Tong Hin-ming mentioned in a report tabled in the Legislative Council the strategic importance of information technology (IT) in operations as corruption cases have become increasingly complex. The commission has stepped up staff training in financial investigation and computer forensics skills, and enhanced investigative resources especially in regard to corruption in the private sector.

In 2008, the commission organised a series of seminars to enhance the investigators&#x27; knowledge on the global and local financial system and its regulatory mechanism.

ICAC&#x27;s financial investigation section probed into 7,095 financial transactions in 168 cases, involving an aggregated sum of HK$4.4 billion (US$567 million) in 2008. The commission&#x27;s computer forensics section carried out 502 computer data analysis projects relating to 111 operations in which 368 computers were seized.

==Weapons==

== Strategy ==
The ICAC uses a three-pronged approach to combating corruption: investigation, prevention, and community education. The most high profile of aspect of its work has been its investigative work, however as important if not more so has been its work in prevention and education. Prevention wise the ICAC offers advice and practical help to enable companies and organisations to introduce systems and procedures that are resistant to corruption. Since its inception the ICAC has worked tirelessly to change the public&#x27;s perception that bribes and kickbacks are an expected and normal part of everyday life, and to reassure citizens that if they face a demand for an illegal payment that the ICAC will be there to investigate.

== In popular culture ==

In Hong Kong Cantonese, &quot;to be invited to have coffee&quot; is a metaphor for being brought to ICAC for questioning due to the practice of offering a cup of coffee to the suspect so that he/she can concentrate during interrogation.

There have been several movies about the ICAC; &quot;The First Shot&quot; in 1993 and &quot;I Corrupt All Cops&quot; in 2009 that tell the history of the ICAC from the inception to how it adopted its interrogation methods. A number of television series have also been made about the commission with the ICAC Investigators family of miniseries being based on actual ICAC cases and made with the full co-operation of the ICAC as part of its community education work.

<text>Dame Roma Flinders Mitchell, (2 October 1913 – 5 March 2000) was an Australian lawyer, judge and state governor. She was the first woman to hold a number of positions in Australia – the country&#x27;s first woman judge, the first woman to be a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, a chancellor of an Australian university and the Governor of an Australian state.

Dame Roma was considered to be a pioneer of the Australian women&#x27;s rights movement. Her grandfather, Samuel James Mitchell, was the first Chief Justice of the Northern Territory.

==Early life and education==
Mitchell was born in Adelaide, South Australia, on 2 October 1913, the second daughter and youngest child of Harold and Maude Mitchell (née Wickham). She was an alumna of St Aloysius Convent College, Adelaide and the University of Adelaide.

==Career==
Mitchell was admitted as a barrister in 1935. In 1962, she was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. As well as a practicing barrister, she was a lecturer in family law at the University of Adelaide and Margaret Nyland was one of her students, with Dame Roma becoming a mentor to her. On the recommendation of Don Dunstan, South Australia&#x27;s 38th Attorney-General, Dame Roma was made the first female Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1965.
She was still the only female judge in South Australia when she retired 18 years later in 1983, although Justices Elizabeth Evatt and Mary Gaudron had been appointed to Federal courts by the Whitlam government. It was not until 1993 that the second woman was appointed to the court, Dame Roma&#x27;s former student Margaret Nyland.

Mitchell was Chancellor of the University of Adelaide from 1983 to 1990, a member of the Council for the Order of Australia from 1981 to 1990, and Governor of South Australia from 1991 to 1996.

==Honours==

Mitchell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 12 June 1971. She was raised to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) on 12 June 1982.

On 26 January 1991, Mitchell was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Australia&#x27;s highest civilian honour, for services to the law, to learning, and to the community. She was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) on 1 January 2000. Mitchell was to receive her honour directly from The Queen of Australia, however, as her health deteriorated, the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, flew to Adelaide and attended her bedside to bestow the honour in a private investiture.

Roma Mitchell Secondary College in northern Adelaide was named for Mitchell, as was Roma Mitchell House, on North Terrace, Adelaide. One of the Bay class patrol boats operated by the Australian Customs is named ACV &quot;Dame Roma Mitchell&quot;. A statue of Dame Roma, in Prince Henry Gardens, directly outside Government House, Adelaide, was erected in 1999.

<text>Stella One Eleven were an Australian pop, rock band, which formed in September 1997. They released three studio albums, &quot;Mr Big Car&quot; (1999), &quot;In Your Hands&quot; (2000) and &quot;Stella One Eleven&quot; (October 2003). Three of the band&#x27;s singles, &quot;Go Slow Girl&quot; (July 2001), &quot;Out There Somewhere&quot;/&quot;S.S.D.&quot; (October 2003) and &quot;She&quot; (March 2004), reached the top 40 on the ARIA Singles Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 they were nominated for Best Independent Release and Best Adult Contemporary Album for &quot;In Your Hands&quot;. At the previous year&#x27;s ceremony their single, &quot;Only Good for Conversation&quot; (September 1999), was nominated for Best Independent Release. The group had disbanded by October 2005 with the members undertaking solo projects.

==History==
===1997–2002: Formation, &quot;Mr Big Car&quot; and &quot;In Your Hands&quot;===
Stella One Eleven were formed in September 1997 in Sydney when singer-songwriter Cindy Ryan went into a studio to record her debut solo album. While working with her session musicians, Ryan decided to form a pop rock band with them instead. Stella One Eleven&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Hard&quot;, appeared in 1998 and was followed by their first album, &quot;Mr Big Car&quot;, in 1999 on Candle Records.

The group&#x27;s line-up was Bowden Campbell (ex-Front End Loader) on guitar, Pat Hayes (ex-Falling Joys) on bass guitar and backing vocals, Genevieve Maynard (ex-Bughouse) on guitar and backing vocals, Ryan on lead vocals and guitar, and Raphael Wittingham (ex-Clouds, Golden Rough) on drums. Most of the album&#x27;s tracks were co-produced by Maynard with Tim Powles (of the Church); two tracks were produced solely by Maynard.

Additional singles issued from the album are &quot;Mr Big Car&quot; (June 1999), &quot;Only Good for Conversation&quot; (September) and &quot;She Lies&quot; (December). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000, &quot;Only Good for Conversation&quot;, was nominated for Best Independent Release.

Stella One Eleven released their second album, &quot;In Your Hands&quot;, on Wow Records in late 2000. The line-up was Hayes, Maynard and Ryan with Brian Cachia on drums and Sam Carter (ex-Dogbouy) on guitar. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 &quot;In Your Hands&quot; was nominated for Best Independent Release and Best Adult Contemporary Album.

It generated a top 40 single, &quot;Go Slow Girl&quot; (July 2001), on the ARIA Singles Chart, which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio station, Triple J. The album reached No. 13 on Alternative Albums Chart. The band wrote the theme song for National Youth Week in Australia and were appointed official Youth Week ambassadors for 2000. In October 2001 the group were guest programmers on &quot;rage&quot;.

===2003–2005: Self-titled album to disbandment===
After a hiatus of two years the group reconvened to release their third studio album, &quot;Stella One Eleven&quot;, on 6 October 2003. Ryan had collaborated with outside writers including Mark Seymour (of Hunters and Collectors) on &quot;Cold&quot; and Paul Andrews of Lazy Susan on &quot;Paleface&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Boys&quot;. It reached number 12 on the ARIA Australasian Artists Albums chart. Lucinda Gardiner of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; described it as &quot;an unashamedly pop album that deserves more recognition then it will probably get... Ryan&#x27;s lyrics are sweeter and more optimistic here than in previous recordings. There is none of the outward vitriol on [it] that is on their other albums.&quot;

They issued two singles – &quot;Out There Somewhere&quot;/&quot;S.S.D. (Sweet Sweet Darling)&quot; in October 2003 and &quot;She&quot; (March 2004) – the latter was produced by Paul Mac. Both singles reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 40.

By October 2005 Stella One Eleven had disbanded with both Ryan and Campbell releasing solo albums: Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Love Hate Tattoo&quot; and Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Crooked Mile&quot;.

<text>Proclamation Day commonly refers to the anniversary of the proclamation of government of the province of South Australia, which continues to be celebrated in South Australia on 28 December, although no longer a public holiday. The anniversary of the establishment of self-government on 21 October 1890 was formerly known as Proclamation Day in Western Australia.

== South Australia ==

===Background===
Proclamation Day in South Australia celebrates the establishment of government in the colony of South Australia as a British province. The province itself was officially created and proclaimed in 1834 when the British Parliament passed the South Australia Act 1834, which empowered King William IV to create South Australia as a British province and to provide for its colonisation and government. It was ratified 19 February 1836 when King William issued Letters Patent establishing the province. The proclamation announcing the establishment of Government was made by Captain John Hindmarsh beside The Old Gum Tree at the present-day suburb of Glenelg North on 28 December 1836. The proclamation specified the same protection under the law for the local native population as for the settlers.

The proclamation was drafted aboard by Hindmarsh&#x27;s private secretary, George Stevenson, and printed by Robert Thomas (1782–1860), who came from England with his family on , arriving at Holdfast Bay on 8 November 1836. Thomas brought with him the first printing press to reach South Australia. The press was a Stanhope Invenit No. 200, and was on display in the State Library until 2001.

It was signed by the Colonial Secretary, Robert Gouger, who had also travelled on the &quot;Africaine&quot;.

The colonising fleet prior to &quot;Buffalo&quot; consisted of eight vessels which had first arrived at Nepean Bay on Kangaroo Island before being directed to Holdfast Bay on the mainland. The first vessel to arrive at Nepean Bay was &quot;Duke of York&quot; on 27 July 1836 which did not proceed to Holdfast Bay but instead set off on a whaling expedition. &quot;Africaine&quot; was the seventh to arrive at Nepean Bay (4 Nov 1836), discharging settlers at Holdfast Bay on 9 November 1836. Seven of these earlier ships preceded Governor John Hindmarsh on &quot;Buffalo&quot; to enable preparations in advance of his formal arrival on 28 December. Thomas&#x27;s wife Mary (1787–1875) published &quot;The Diary of Mary Thomas&quot;, in which she described the journey on &quot;Africaine&quot; and the early years in South Australia. An extract from the diary reads: &quot;About December 20th 1836, we built a rush hut a short distance from our tents for the better accommodation of part of our family... and in this place (about 12 feet square) the first printing in South Australia was produced&quot;.

==== Text of the Proclamation ====
By His Excellency John Hindmarsh, Knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty’s Province of South Australia.

In announcing to the Colonists of His Majesty’s Province of South Australia, the establishment of the Government, I hereby call upon them to conduct themselves on all occasions with order and quietness, duly to respect the laws, and by a course of industry and sobriety, by the practice of sound morality and a strict observance of the Ordinances of Religion, to prove themselves worthy to be the Founders of a great and free Colony.

It is also, at this time especially, my duty to apprize the Colonists of my resolution, to take every lawful means for extending the same protection to the Native Population as to the rest of His Majesty’s Subjects and of my firm determination to punish with exemplary severity, all acts of violence or injustice which may in any manner be practiced or attempted against the Natives who are to be considered as much under the Safeguard of the law as the Colonists themselves, and equally entitled to the privileges of British Subjects. I trust therefore, with confidence to the exercise of moderation and forbearance by all Classes, in their intercourse with the Native Inhabitants, and that they will omit no opportunity of assisting me to fulfil His Majesty’s most gracious and benevolent intentions toward them, by promoting their advancement in civilization, and ultimately, under the blessing of Divine Providence, their conversion to the Christian Faith.

By His Excellency’s Command,&lt;br&gt;
Robert Gouger,&lt;br&gt;
Colonial Secretary.&lt;br&gt;
Glenelg, 28th December 1836.&lt;br&gt;

God Save the King.

===Status as a holiday===
In 1876 Parliament decreed that the Proclamation Day holiday, a gala occasion when thousands descended on Glenelg, would henceforth be celebrated on 27 December in lieu of the 28th, in order to make a three-day Christmas holiday. Henry J. Moseley, proprietor of the Glenelg&#x27;s Pier Hotel, was the first and loudest protester against the move, which was rescinded.

The Proclamation Day public holiday is prescribed in the South Australian &quot;Holidays Act, 1910&quot;. Originally the Act provided that the day was to be observed on 28 December, except when that day occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, at which times it was to be celebrated on the following Monday. On 4 November 1993, the &quot;Holidays Act 1910&quot; was amended by the &quot;Holidays (Proclamation Day, Australia Day and Bank Holidays) Amendment Act 1993&quot;, changing the date for observance of the day to the day following the Christmas Day holiday, to coincide with Boxing Day as celebrated in other states. The change was made primarily as a response to the recommendations of the South Australian Industrial Relations Advisory Council, which had advised that the holiday should be changed to avoid stop/start work patterns, particularly in the retail industry. The change was also said to be consistent with national uniformity arrangements in relation to certain public holidays.

Formal ceremonies involving the most senior current officials and politicians, followed by public celebrations, continue to be held at the still-extant Old Gum Tree at Glenelg North on 28 December, or one day earlier on 27 December in some years. However, a small 2015 poll indicated that many South Australians did not know why Proclamation Day was commemorated, and it was not included in the school curriculum.

==Western Australia==
Proclamation Day also refers to 21 October 1890, the day that Western Australia achieved self-government, with its own constitution and self-elected parliament. Proclamation Day was originally a public holiday, but its significance was overshadowed by the celebrations of the Eight Hours Day, which were held on the same day, and by 1919 the public holiday had been replaced by Labour Day.

Western Australia Day is celebrated on the first Monday in June each year to commemorate the founding of the Swan River Colony in 1829.

<text>David Keith Williamson (born 1942) is an Australian playwright, who has also written screenplays and teleplays. He became known in the early 1970s with his political comic drama &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot;, and other well-known plays include &quot;The Club&quot;, &quot;Travelling North&quot;, and &quot;Emerald City&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
David Williamson was born in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1942, and was brought up in Bairnsdale. He initially studied mechanical engineering at the University of Melbourne from 1960, but left and graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1965. His early forays into the theatre were as an actor and writer of skits for the Engineers&#x27; Revue at Melbourne University&#x27;s Union Theatre at lunchtime during the early 1960s, and as a satirical sketch writer for Monash University student reviews and the Emerald Hill Theatre Company.

After a brief stint as design engineer for GM Holden, Williamson became a lecturer in mechanical engineering and thermodynamics at Swinburne University of Technology (then Swinburne Technical College) in 1966 while studying social psychology as a postgraduate part-time at the University of Melbourne. He completed a Master of Arts in Psychology in 1970, and then completed further postgraduate research in social psychology. Williamson later lectured in social psychology at Swinburne, where he remained until 1972.

==Career==

Williamson first turned to writing and performing in plays in 1967 with La Mama Theatre Company and the Pram Factory, and rose to prominence in the early 1970s, with works such as &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot; (later turned into a 1976 film), a comic drama set during the 1969 federal election; and &quot;The Removalists&quot; (1971). He also collaborated on the screenplays for &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982). Williamson&#x27;s work as a playwright focuses on themes of politics, loyalty and family in contemporary urban Australia, particularly in two of its major cities, Melbourne and Sydney.

Major stage works include &quot;The Club&quot;, &quot;The Department&quot;, &quot;Travelling North&quot;, &quot;The Perfectionist&quot;, &quot;Emerald City&quot;, &quot;Money and Friends&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Lies&quot;.

Recent work has included &quot;Dead White Males&quot;, a satirical approach to postmodernism and university ethics; &quot;Up for Grabs&quot;, which starred Madonna in its London premiere; and the &quot;Jack Manning Trilogy&quot; (&quot;Face To Face&quot;, &quot;Conversation&quot;, &quot;Charitable Intent&quot;) which take as their format community conferencing, a new form of restorative justice, in which Williamson became interested in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In recent years he has alternated work between larger stages (including &quot;Soul Mates&quot;, &quot;Amigos&quot; and &quot;Influence&quot; – all premiered with the Sydney Theatre Company) and smaller ones (including the Manning trilogy, &quot;Flatfoot&quot; and &quot;Operator&quot;, which premiered at the Ensemble Theatre).

In 2005, he announced his retirement from main-stage productions, although he has continued to write new plays for the mainstage, many produced with the Ensemble Theatre. He had a serious health problem, cardiac arrhythmia, which had required frequent hospitalisation. An operation resolved this issue, but then in 2009 he had a mild stroke, from which he recovered fully.

In 2007, &quot;Lotte&#x27;s Gift&quot;, a one-woman show starring Karin Schaupp, which traced a journey through Schaupp&#x27;s own life as well as those of her mother and grandmother (the Lotte of the title), was produced.

In 2021, his memoir, &quot;Home Truths&quot;, was published by HarperCollins. Reviewing the book for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Peter Craven wrote &quot;He comes across as a likeable, flawed fellow with no more blindness than people of lesser talent&quot;.

==Other activities==
Williamson was instrumental in the founding of the Noosa Long Weekend Festival, a cultural festival in Noosa, Queensland, where he lives.

In August 2006 Cate Molloy, former Australian Labor Party member of the Queensland Parliament for Noosa, announced that Williamson would be her campaign manager as she sought to recontest her seat as an Independent.

==Personal life==
Williamson is married to Kristin Williamson (sister of independent filmmaker Chris Löfvén) who have homes in Sydney and on Queensland&#x27;s Sunshine Coast. They have five adult children.

His son, Rory Williamson, and his stepson, Felix Williamson, are both actors. Rory starred as Stork in the 2001 revival of &quot;The Coming of Stork&quot; at the Stables Theatre in Sydney, produced by Felix&#x27;s company, the Bare Naked Theatre Company.

<doc id="534675" wikidata="Q577238" url="?curid=534675" title="Retroperitoneal space">
<text>The retroperitoneal space (retroperitoneum) is the anatomical space (sometimes a potential space) behind (&quot;retro&quot;) the peritoneum. It has no specific delineating anatomical structures. Organs are retroperitoneal if they have peritoneum on their anterior side only. Structures that are not suspended by mesentery in the abdominal cavity and that lie between the parietal peritoneum and abdominal wall are classified as retroperitoneal.

This is different from organs that are not retroperitoneal, which have peritoneum on their posterior side and are suspended by mesentery in the abdominal cavity. 

The retroperitoneum can be further subdivided into the following:
*Perirenal (or perinephric) space 
*Anterior pararenal (or paranephric) space
*Posterior pararenal (or paranephric) space

==Retroperitoneal structures==
Structures that lie behind the peritoneum are termed &quot;retroperitoneal&quot;. Organs that were once suspended within the abdominal cavity by mesentery but migrated posterior to the peritoneum during the course of embryogenesis to become retroperitoneal are considered to be secondarily retroperitoneal organs.
* Primarily retroperitoneal, meaning the structures were retroperitoneal during the entirety of development: 
** urinary
*** adrenal glands
*** kidneys
*** ureter
** circulatory
*** aorta
*** inferior vena cava
** digestive 
***anal canal
* Secondarily retroperitoneal, meaning the structures initially were suspended in mesentery and later migrated behind the peritoneum during development
** the duodenum, except for the proximal first segment, which is intraperitoneal
** ascending and descending portions of the colon (but not the transverse colon, sigmoid and the cecum)
** pancreas, except for the tail, which is intraperitoneal

===Subdivisions===
;Perirenal space
It is also called the perinephric space. Bounded by the anterior and posterior leaves of the renal fascia. It contains the following structures:
* Adrenal gland
* Kidney
* Renal vessels
*Perirenal fat (also &quot;perirenal fat capsule&quot;, &quot;perinephric fat, or &quot;adipose capsule of the kidney&quot;) is external to the fibrous capsule of the kidney, and internal to the renal fascia (which separates it from the pararenal fat); connective tissue trabeculae extend through it to unite the fibrous capsule of the kidney, and the renal fascia. Perirenal fat is most abundant upon the posterior aspect, inferior pole and along the lateral margins of the kidney.

;Anterior pararenal space
Bounded by the posterior layer of peritoneum and the anterior leaf of the renal fascia. It contains the following structures:
* Pancreas
* Ascending and descending colon
* Duodenum

;Posterior pararenal space
Bounded by the posterior leaf of the renal fascia and the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall. It contains only fat (&quot;pararenal fat&quot; also known as &quot;pararenal fat body&quot;, &quot;paranephric body&quot;, or &quot;paranephric fat&quot;).

Pararenal fat is a fatty layer situated posterior to the renal compartment, and extending inferiorly into the iliac fossa. It is situated posterior to the posterior aspect of renal fascia, and anterior to the aponeuroses of the retrorenal muscles. It is plentiful in the dihedral angle of the iliopsoas muscle and the quadratus lumborum muscle, filling the lumbar fossa posterior and inferior to the kidney.

==Clinical significance==
Bleeding from a blood vessel or structure in the retroperitoneal such as the aorta or inferior vena cava into the retroperitoneal space can lead to a retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

* Retroperitoneal fibrosis
* Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection

It is also possible to have a neoplasm in this area, more commonly a metastasis; or very rarely a primary neoplasm. The most common type is a sarcoma followed by lymphoma, extragonadal germ cell tumor, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor/GIST. Examples of tumors include:

*Primary peritoneal carcinoma 
*Pseudomyxoma peritonei

Examples of sarcomas include:
*Soft-tissue sarcoma
**liposarcoma
**leiomyosarcoma 
**Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, a clinically distinct sarcoma of the area

* Retropubic space
* Rectovesical pouch
* Vesicouterine pouch
* Rectouterine pouch (Pouch of Douglas)

<text>Alfred Brian Peckford (born August 27, 1942) is a Canadian politician who served as the third premier of Newfoundland from March 26, 1979 to March 22, 1989. A member of the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, Peckford was first elected as the Member of the House of Assembly (MHA) for Green Bay following the 1972 general election. He served as a cabinet minister in Frank Moores&#x27; government before he was elected as PC leader in 1979 following Moores&#x27; retirement.

==Background==
Alfred Brian Peckford was born in Whitbourne, Newfoundland on August 27, 1942, and was raised in the communities of Whitbourne, Marystown, and Lewisporte. He earned a Bachelor of Education degree from Memorial University of Newfoundland, and has completed postgraduate work in English Literature, Education, Psychology, and French Literature. Prior to entering politics, he was a high school teacher in rural Newfoundland. He was the founding patron of the Wessex Society of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Politics==
Peckford was the Progressive Conservative (PC) candidate in the district of Green Bay in the 1972 provincial election. The PC Party won a majority government in the election and Peckford was narrowly elected in his district over the Liberal candidate. In 1973 he was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to Premier Frank Moores and the following year he was sworn into cabinet as the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. In the 1975 general election Peckford won 70 percent of the popular vote in his district, defeating the Liberal and New Democratic Party candidates. The PC Party won its second majority government under the leadership of Moores and Peckford remained the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. The following year Moores shuffled his cabinet and Peckford was appointed Minister of Mines and Energy; and Rural and Northern Development.

===Minister of Mines and Energy===
Peckford was appointed Minister of Mines and Energy on September 9, 1976, replacing John Crosbie who was leaving provincial politics to run federally. The offshore oil industry was seen as a bright spot in the economic outlook for the province. As the minister responsible Peckford fought hard for provincial control over the emerging industry. Oil companies suspended offshore drilling in 1977 in protest, but after some compromises were made the oil companies eventually accepted the Newfoundland terms, which aimed to maximize local economic benefits and minimize social and environmental disruption. Oil companies would start drilling once again in 1978 under the province&#x27;s term. One of the terms arranged was that oil companies would be responsible for paying the cost of training local people to work in the industry. The companies had the choice of spending the money themselves on training and researching or paying it into the provincial treasury. Peckford said he pushed for these terms with oil companies after seeing resource give aways in the mining sector as well as the Upper Churchill Falls hydroelectric deal. While Peckford was able to negotiate an agreement with oil companies over drilling in the continental shelf, the province was engaged in ownership dispute with the federal Liberal government over offshore petroleum resources. This dispute was settled after Peckford became premier.

===Premier===
On January 19, 1979, Moores announced he was stepping down as premier of the province and leaving politics. Even before announcing his leadership bid Peckford was mentioned as a likely frontrunner to succeed Moores. Ten people ran for the leadership of the party at its March 17, 1979, convention. Out of those ten, Peckford, Leo Barry, Walter Carter and William Doody were seen as the likelier candidates. Peckford was still considered by some media as the frontrunner and had racked up the most cabinet and caucus support. At the convention he led on the first two ballots and was elected leader over Carter and Doody on the third and final ballot.

At 36 years of age Peckford became the youngest first minister in Newfoundland&#x27;s history and one of the few members of the political elite from a working-class outport background. Liberal leader Bill Rowe challenged Peckford to call an election immediately. He instead waited several months, first bringing down a budget, introducing new legislation and overhauling the rules of legislative procedure. On May 25, 1979, the legislature was dissolved with an election called for June 18. The election was called after Rowe had announced a Liberal leadership convention for July 6–7, due to party dissension over his leadership. While Rowe had planned on contesting the leadership himself he stepped aside and the Liberals installed Liberal MP Don Jamieson as leader two days after the election was called. Prior to Moores&#x27; resignation an opinion poll showed the Liberals leading the Progressive Conservatives; no formal polls were conducted during the election campaign. On election day Peckford led his party to its third straight majority government, they won 50 percent of the popular vote and 33 of the 52 seats in the House of Assembly. The Liberals won 41 percent of the vote and 19 seats, the NL NDP won 8 percent of the vote but no seats.

Resource management dominated Peckford&#x27;s ten years as Premier of Newfoundland, particularly offshore oil, the fisheries, and hydroelectric developments. In all three areas, Peckford hoped to wrestle control from outside interests to secure greater revenues for the province. He argued this would end Newfoundland&#x27;s status as the poorest province in the country. His government tried to renegotiate the Upper Churchill contract with Hydro Quebec, which had been signed by Premier Joey Smallwood in 1969. The deal sold cheap power to Hydro Quebec for 65 years with no allowances for inflation or revision. The province launched two legal battles over the deal but the Supreme Court of Canada ruled twice in Quebec&#x27;s favour, in 1984 and 1988. The Peckford government sought to develop power on the Lower Churchill River, but could not secure a transmission route through Quebec into lucrative American and Canadian markets.

Although the fisheries remained vital to the economy of rural Newfoundland, they fell under federal jurisdiction. Ottawa determined fish quotas, distributed trawler licenses, and set all other aspects of fisheries policy. During the 1980 constitutional negotiations Peckford tried to acquire greater provincial control of the fisheries, but was unable to get enough support from other premiers. Peckford argued the province had a historic and moral right to the fisheries and the government did its best to influence federal fisheries policy. When the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans issued licenses to three factory freezer trawlers in 1985, he declared it &quot;a disaster of monumental proportions&quot;. Overfishing continued to be an issue, and decisions made by Peckford&#x27;s own administration did not help matters. Just three years after he left office cod stocks collapsed and the federal government announced a cod moratorium, which is still in effect in 2012.

After securing deals with oil companies regarding offshore exploration, he battled with Ottawa over ownership of the oil. The Peckford government had tried to negotiate an agreement with Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government over ownership, but were unsuccessful. With the two governments unable to come to an agreement the dispute was sent to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1982. The Peckford and Trudeau governments were that far apart on their views that Peckford hinted that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians might take a more radical stance, similar to the Quebec separatists, if the courts ruled against them.

During his heated dispute with the federal government Peckford called an election for April 6, 1982, hoping to regain a mandate to continue his tough stance with Ottawa and renegotiate the Upper Churchill contract with Quebec. The Liberals, led by Len Stirling, disagreed with Peckford&#x27;s aggressive stances and campaigned on a slogan of &quot;Make Work Not War&quot;. On election night Peckford led his party to victory again, winning 61 percent of the vote and 44 of the 52 seats in the House of Assembly. Only eight Liberals were elected and Stirling was defeated in his own riding of Bonavista North. During his election victory speech Peckford stated that &quot;I am more convinced than I have any time in the past that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians speak [with] one voice when we all say one day the sun will shine and have-not will be no more&quot;, words that went on to become a household phrase in the province.

In March 1984 the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government owned the right to develop minerals on the continental shelf off Canada&#x27;s coast. Peckford shifted his efforts to gaining joint management and most of the revenues from offshore oil resources and embarked on a cross-Canada tour to drum up support for the province&#x27;s position. In the September 4, 1984, federal election Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party won a large majority government. Prior to the election Mulroney had agreed to a fair deal for the province with regards to offshore energy resources. On February 11, 1985, less than six months since Mulroney&#x27;s election victory, both levels of government signed the Atlantic Accord. The Accord granted Newfoundland significant decision-making powers and financial benefits. It made the federal and provincial governments equal partners in the management of offshore developments through the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board. The Accord was widely hailed as a success for the Peckford government and a turning point for the provincial economy.

Weeks after signing the Atlantic Accord, Peckford announced that an election would be held on April 2, 1985. He self-proclaimed himself the &quot;Great Negotiator&quot; for the Atlantic Accord but during the election he was hounded by teachers and public service employees who were upset with the two year government-imposed wage freeze. Fraser March, the president of the Newfoundland Public Employees Association, had pledged to campaign against &quot;every Tory in the province&quot;. A poll released just days before the vote showed the Progressive Conservatives and Liberals were tied at 41.5 percent outside St. John&#x27;s, while Peckford&#x27;s Tories led in the capital city. The Progressive Conservatives won 49 per cent of the popular vote on election night, compared to 37 percent for the Liberals and 14 percent for the NDP.

Although resource development dominated Peckford&#x27;s time as premier his government is responsible for a number of things that have shaped Newfoundland and Labrador. After his party was re-elected in 1979 Peckford appointed Lynn Verge and Hazel Newhook to cabinet, they became the first women to serve as Cabinet ministers in the province. Peckford also brought in the first pay equity policy, established the first Status of Women Council, and in 1983 appointed Margaret Cameron as the province&#x27;s first woman Supreme Court justice. In 1980 the new provincial flag, his government is responsible for the Department of Environment, they brought in grade 12 to the high school curriculum, and started construction on the Trans-Labrador Highway. In 1987 the Peckford government partnered with Phillip Sprung to construct a hydroponic greenhouse complex on the St. John&#x27;s-Mount Pearl border. While the greenhouses were supposed to create jobs, tap into a profitable export market, and supply local consumers with fresh and affordable vegetables year-round, they ended up being an economic disaster. The government poured $22 million into the project and it went bankrupt only two years later. The credibility of Peckford and the Progressive Conservatives had been hurt by the project. On January 21, 1989, he announced he was leaving politics, Tom Rideout was chosen as his successor in March, and the PC Party was defeated in the provincial election the following month by the Liberals.

==Post-political life==
Peckford became a business consultant and has sat on numerous boards since leaving politics including the board of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in the 1990s. He relocated to British Columbia in the early 1990s and in 1998 was appointed to lead a one-person inquiry into the state of Fraser River salmon stocks and fishery management.

In 2008, he was appointed chair of a federal government–appointed expert panel to review federal chronic disease policy, especially diabetes, and to present a report to the federal Health minister. He is currently a director of Strongbow Exploration Inc., a public junior mining company. He has also been an advisor to the British Columbia Conservative Party, co-chairing the party&#x27;s issues management committee.

Peckford endorsed the People&#x27;s Party led by Maxime Bernier in the 2021 Canadian federal election and Peckford appeared on Jordan Peterson&#x27;s podcast on January 26, 2022, where he claimed that the Canadian government infringed on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On January 27, 2022, it was revealed that Peckford is the lead plaintiff for the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms in a federal court case which is challenging the validity of the federal government’s ban on travel for people who are unvaccinated.

Peckford and his wife currently live in Qualicum Beach, Vancouver Island.

<doc id="534690" wikidata="Q464247" url="?curid=534690" title="Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1">
<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1 () was a Soviet fighter aircraft of World War II that was designed to meet a requirement for a high-altitude fighter issued in 1939. To minimize demand on strategic materials such as aluminum, the aircraft was mostly constructed from steel tubing and wood. Flight testing revealed a number of deficiencies, but it was ordered into production before they could be fixed. Although difficult to handle, one hundred were built before the design was modified into the MiG-3. The aircraft was issued to fighter regiments of the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) in 1941, but most were apparently destroyed during the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.

==Design and development==

===Design phase===
The MiG-1 was designed in response to a requirement for a high-altitude fighter with an inline engine issued by the VVS in January 1939. Initially the aircraft, designated &quot;I-200&quot;, was designed in the Polikarpov construction bureau. Work started in June 1939, under the direction of Nikolai Polikarpov and his assistant M. Tetivikin. Polikarpov himself preferred radial engines and promoted his I-180 design at that time, but when the powerful Mikulin AM-37 inline engine became available, he decided to use it in a fighter. The approach that he selected was to build the smallest possible aircraft around the intended powerplant, thereby minimizing weight and drag — the philosophy of the light fighter. As specified, the aircraft was to be capable of reaching 670 km/h (417 mph). In August 1939, Polikarpov fell out of favor with Joseph Stalin and as a result, when Polikarpov went in November 1939 to tour Germany&#x27;s aviation works, the Soviet authorities decided to scatter his construction team and create a new Experimental Construction Section (OKO), headed by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich, which remained formally subordinated to the Polikarpov bureau until June 1940. Further work upon the I-200 design was assigned to Mikoyan and Gurevich, who later became recognized — not with full justice — as its designers.

The MiG-1 was a low-wing monoplane with a tailwheel undercarriage of mixed construction. Due to shortages of light alloys, the rear fuselage was made from wood, but the front fuselage, from the propeller to the rear of the cockpit, was a welded steel tube truss covered by duralumin. The bulk of the wing was wooden, but the center section was all-metal with a steel I-section main spar. The wing used a Clark YH profile. It was evenly tapered with rounded tips and the outer wing panels had 5° of dihedral. All three landing gear wheels retracted hydraulically; the main units inwards into the wing center section. The cockpit was situated well aft, which seriously limited forward vision when landing and taxiing. The AM-37 engine was not yet available and the less powerful V-12 Mikulin AM-35A had to be substituted. It had six exhaust ejectors, one for each pair of cylinders, that provided some additional thrust. It drove a VISh-22Ye controllable-pitch propeller in diameter. The air intakes for the supercharger were in the wing roots and the oil cooler was on the port side of the engine cowling. The radiator was underneath the cockpit. Armament included two fuselage-mounted ShKAS machine guns and one UBS machine gun.

The result was a highly conventional aircraft that first flew on schedule on 5 April 1940 at the Khodynka Aerodrome in Moscow with chief test pilot Arkadij Ekatov at the controls. On 24 May the first prototype attained a speed of 648.5 km/h (402.9 mph) at 6,900 m (22,638 ft). It could not, however, attain the speed originally specified by the Air Force with this engine. The second prototype took to the air on 9 May, but the third aircraft, the first to be armed, was forced to wait until 6 June, as problems with its synchronization gear prolonged the ground firing tests. On 5 August was reached at using maximum boost. Time to altitude figures were 5.1 minutes to and 7.2 minutes to and speeds at lower altitudes were at and at .

===Production and improvements===
The I-200 was ordered into production almost immediately, on 31 May 1940. In contrast to the other competing designs, the I-26 (Yak-1) and I-301 (LaGG-3), the I-200 successfully completed the state trials in August on its first attempt. But the trials revealed a number of serious defects, including inadequate visibility when taxiing, poor-quality plexiglas in the canopy obscuring the pilot&#x27;s view, heavy controls, poor longitudinal stability, difficulty in opening the canopy, an excessively hot cockpit and a &quot;dangerous propensity to flick from a simple stall into a spin from which it was almost impossible to recover&quot;.

A number of improvements were ordered to be made to the aircraft as a result of the deficiencies discovered during the trials, but only a few of them were able to be implemented before production began as the VVS was very anxious to get modern fighters into service. These included an additional air intake on the starboard side of the nose for the oil cooler, rubber sheaths around the fuel tanks to make them self-sealing, two underwing bomb racks each capable of carrying a FAB-100 bomb, a PBP-1 gunsight and each ShKAS was given 375 rounds and the UBS 300 rounds. From the ninth aircraft onwards the side-opening canopy was replaced by a rear-sliding canopy that could be jettisoned in flight. On 9 December 1940 the first 100 I-200s were designated as the MiG-1 (after the initials of Mikoyan and Gurevich).

The improvement process continued throughout the production run, though they were not immediately implemented in the production line, but were instead incorporated in a fourth prototype for evaluation. This aircraft first flew on 29 October 1940 and was a significant improvement over the I-200s then in production. It passed its State acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated in the production line from the 101st I-200. These were designated as the MiG-3 on 9 December, although the first production MiG-3 was not completed until 20 December 1940.

===Additional testing===
The I-200 prototypes were used to evaluate a number of proposals. For example, the second prototype was fitted with a prototype of the AM-37 engine and first flew with that engine on 6 January 1941. It experienced severe vibration problems and, despite efforts to cure the problems, failed during a flight on 7 May, and was destroyed in the ensuing crash. The third prototype was generally used for armament trials, experimenting with RS-82 rockets among other weapons. For another trial it was equipped with the experimental MP-3 autocannon carried underneath the wings in external pods and redesignated as the IP-201. The 12.7 mm UBS gun was removed for these tests and the space freed up was used to install an extra fuel tank. Initially the cannon had the low rate of fire of only 300 rounds per minute, but this was soon doubled and the gun was renamed the MP-6. Installation of the guns was difficult, despite the aircraft&#x27;s metal outer wing panels, and the wings deformed when the cannon were first mounted. It made its first and only flight on 1 December 1940 carrying two MP-6s and two 12.7 mm AP-12.7 machine guns, but a blocked fuel line caused a forced landing before the guns could be fired. Testing on a variety of other aircraft revealed very unsatisfactory performance from the guns and their development was canceled. The designers were arrested on 15 May 1941 and executed on 28 October 1941.

==Operational history==
On 3 December 1940 the VVS ordered that the 41st Fighter Regiment (&quot;istrebitel&#x27;nyy aviatsionnyy polk&quot;), based at the Crimean town of Kacha, was to conduct operational trials on the I-200 and that they were to be transferred to the 146th Fighter Regiment at Yevpatoria, also in the Crimea, for pilot training after the conclusion of the trials. By 22 February 1941, 89 had been issued to regular fighter units, notably the 89th Fighter Regiment at Kaunas, Lithuania and the 41st Fighter Regiment at Białystok, Poland, both places under Soviet occupation since 1939–40. On 1 June 1941 they were spread out a bit more, with 31 in the Baltic Military District, 37 in the Western Special Military District, one in the Kiev Military District and eight in the Odessa Military District for a total of 77 on hand, of which only 55 were operational. An additional eight MiG-1s were assigned to the Soviet Navy. However, only four pilots were trained to handle either the MiG-1 or the MiG-3.

Little is known of the performance of the MiG-1 in combat as most were likely destroyed during the opening days of Operation Barbarossa. However, one was still in the inventory of the VVS as late as 1944 when it was recorded as withdrawn that year.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 () is a Soviet fighter-interceptor used during World War II. It was a development of the MiG-1 by the OKO (opytno-konstruktorskij otdel — Experimental Design Department) of Zavod (Factory) No. 1 in Moscow to remedy problems found during the MiG-1&#x27;s development and operations. It replaced the MiG-1 on the production line at Factory No. 1 on 20 December 1940 and was built in large numbers during 1941 before Factory No. 1 was converted to build the Ilyushin Il-2.

On 22 June 1941, at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, some 981 were in service with the Soviet Air Forces (VVS), the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) and Soviet Naval Aviation. The MiG-3 was difficult to fly in peacetime and much more so in combat. Originally designed as a high-altitude fighter-interceptor, combat over the Eastern Front was generally at lower altitudes, where it was inferior to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 as well as most of its Soviet contemporaries. It was also pressed into service as a fighter-bomber during the autumn of 1941 but it was equally unsuited for this. The losses suffered in combat were very high, in percentage the highest among all the VVS fighters, with 1,432 shot down. The survivors were concentrated in the PVO, where its disadvantages mattered less, the last being withdrawn from service before the end of the war.

==Development==
The large number of defects noted during flight testing of the MiG-1 forced Mikoyan and Gurevich to make multiple modifications to the design. Testing was done on a full-size aircraft in the T-1 wind tunnel belonging to the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) to evaluate the problems and their proposed solutions. The first aircraft to see all of these changes applied was the fourth prototype of the I-200. It first flew on 29 October 1940 and was approved for production after passing its State acceptance trials. The first MiG-3, as the improved aircraft was named on 9 December, was completed on 20 December 1940 and another 20 were delivered by the end of the year.

These changes included:
* The engine was moved forward 100 mm (4 in) to improve longitudinal stability.
* A new water radiator (OP-310) was fitted
* The first two modifications allowed an additional fuel tank to be fitted underneath the pilot&#x27;s seat.
* The outer wing panel dihedral was increased by one degree to increase lateral stability.
* An additional oil tank was mounted under the engine.
* Piping was fitted to use cooled inert exhaust gasses in the fuel tanks to reduce the chance of fire.
* The back of the pilot&#x27;s seat was armored with an plate (increased to in later models).
* The supercharger intakes were streamlined.
* The main landing gear was strengthened and the size of the main wheels was increased to 650 x 200 mm (25.5 x 7.87 in).
* The canopy glazing was extended aft to improve the view to the rear which allowed for the installation of a shelf behind the pilot for an RSI-1 radio (later upgraded to an RSI-4).
* The instrument panel layout was improved and a PBP-1A gunsight replaced the original PBP-1.
* Ammunition for the ShKAS guns was increased to 750 rounds per gun.
* Two additional underwing hardpoints were added to carry up to 220 kg (485 lb) of bombs, spray containers or RS-82 rockets.

State acceptance testing of two production aircraft was conducted between 27 January and 26 February 1941. They were found to be over heavier than the MiG-1, which reduced maneuverability and field performance. Time to decreased by over a minute and the service ceiling proved to be less. The MiG-3 was faster at sea level and at altitude. While the ranges reached by both aircraft were farther than that of the older aircraft, they were still less than the required. Mikoyan and Gurevich protested against the range results as their calculations showed that the MiG-3 could reach based on a specific fuel consumption (SFC) of 0.46 kg/km (1.64 lb/mile). During the State acceptance trials the SFC was 0.48 kg/km (1.71 lb/mile) but the operational trials conducted earlier showed a SFC of 0.38 kg/km (1.35 lb/mile). They blamed the deficiency on a failure to use an altitude correction and that the engines had not been properly adjusted. They went as far as arranging for two more flights between Leningrad and Moscow to prove that the MiG-3 could fly 1,000 km (621 mi). Two production aircraft were flown on ranges of and , flying at 90% of maximum speed and at an altitude of , contradicting the report of the NII VVS (&quot;Naoochno-Issledovatel&#x27;skiy Institoot Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily&quot;—Air Force Scientific Test Institute).

Despite the teething problems with the MiG-3, in 1941, one of the aircraft&#x27;s designers—Mikhail Gurevich—was awarded the State Stalin Prize for his contribution to Soviet aviation.

A number of reports had been received about poor quality aircraft received by the regiments which pointed directly at the NII VVS as it was responsible for monitoring the quality of the aircraft delivered to the VVS. On 31 May 1941 the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defense decreed that the NII VVS had been negligent. A number of senior managers were demoted and the head of the Institute, Major General A. I. Filin was summarily executed.

A number of MiG-3s were found to have unacceptable performance at high altitudes despite having been designed as a high-altitude interceptor. The oxygen supply was often insufficient and the stall and spin characteristics were very dangerous, especially to inexperienced pilots. This was demonstrated on 10 April 1941 when three pilots of the 31st Fighter Regiment of the Air Defenses (IAP PVO) attempted to intercept a German high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft over Kaunas, Lithuania flying at . All three aircraft entered irrecoverable spins and the pilots were forced to bail out, one being killed. The NII VVS sent an engineer to investigate and he found that the pilots had flown very few hours on the MiG-3 and that that was their first high-altitude sortie. Other problems included insufficient fuel and oil pressure at altitude due to problems with the pumps.

===Comparison with other fighters===
The MiG-3&#x27;s top speed of at was faster than the of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-2 in service at the beginning of 1941 and the British Supermarine Spitfire V&#x27;s . At lower altitudes the MiG&#x27;s speed advantage disappeared as its maximum speed at sea level was only while the Bf 109F-2 could do . Unfortunately for the MiG-3 and its pilots, aerial combat over the Eastern Front generally took place at low and medium altitudes where it had no speed advantage.

The MiG&#x27;s loaded weight of was greater than the Bf 109F-2&#x27;s and it was less maneuverable in the horizontal plane than the Bf 109 due to its higher wing loading. This lack of maneuverability was exacerbated by the MiG-3&#x27;s poor climb performance, its instability at high speeds (which can make aerial gunnery difficult due to the point of aim &quot;wandering&quot; and requiring constant pilot input to remain on target), and its underpowered armament.

The MiG-3&#x27;s standard armament was one UBS machine gun and two ShKAS machine guns, all mounted in the engine cowling and synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. In contrast, most versions of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 that it encountered had one cannon and two machine guns (although the Bf 109F used during Operation Barbarossa had a 15 mm MG 151/15, meaning that it was armed little better than the MiG). To remedy this problem, 821 aircraft were built with one 12.7 mm UBK machine gun in a pod under each wing in mid-1941. This lowered its speed by about at all altitudes, which was unpopular with the pilots, some of whom removed the pods. One hundred aircraft were equipped with a pair of UBS machine guns in lieu of the ShKAS weapons. Another 215 aircraft also had just the UBS machine guns but were fitted to carry six RS-82 rockets. A total of 72 aircraft mounted a pair of 20 mm ShVAK cannon. A wide variety of armaments were experimented with by various units at the requests of their pilots or to make up shortages.

===Production===
The NKAP (&quot;Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti&quot;—People&#x27;s Commission of the Aircraft Industry) announced its 1941 production plan on 9 December 1940. Zavod Nr. 1 in Moscow-Chodinka would be required to build a total of 3,500 in 1941. Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG-3 and complete one hundred aircraft by the end of the year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor&#x27;kiy would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG-3, although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards. 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was on pace to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July, 562 in August and 450 in September. In October the German advance on Moscow forced the Zavod Nr. 1, and its OKO, to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions. However, shortly afterwards, Stalin sent a telegram to the directors of the plants building the Ilyushin Il-2 and the MiG-3 demanding more Il-2 production, resulting in MiG-3 production being terminated in favor of the Il-2, with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares. An additional factor in cancellation of the MiG-3 was that its Mikulin AM-35A engine was closely related to the Il-2&#x27;s AM-38 allowing production to be quickly switched from one to the other.

MiG-3 production at Zavod Nr. 1 had already been planned to be reduced from a NKAP order of 27 August that required the factory to produce 420 fighters in September, declining to 100 in December with Il-2 production ramping up to 250 in December while the former aircraft repair plant at Khodynka Aerodrome (Moscow) was to be transferred to the NKAP, redesignated as Zavod Nr. 165, and begin production of MiG-3s. The German advance disrupted these plans for Zavod 165 and it never produced a single MiG-3.

==Operational history==

Deliveries to frontline fighter regiments began in the spring of 1941 and were a handful for pilots accustomed to the lower-performance and docile Polikarpov I-152 and I-153 biplanes and the Polikarpov I-16 monoplane. It remained tricky and demanding to fly even after the extensive improvements made over the MiG-1. Many fighter regiments had not kept pace in training pilots to handle the MiG and the rapid pace of deliveries resulted in many units having more MiGs than trained pilots during the Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion. By 1 June 1941, 1,029 MIG-3s were on strength, but there were only 494 trained pilots.

In contrast to the untrained pilots of the 31st Fighter Regiment, those of the 4th Fighter Regiment were able to claim three German high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down before war broke out in June 1941. High-altitude combat of this sort was to be rare on the Eastern Front where most air-to-air engagements were at altitudes well below . At these altitudes the MiG-3 was outclassed by the Bf 109 in all respects, and even by other new Soviet fighters such as the Yakovlev Yak-1. The shortage of ground-attack aircraft in 1941 forced it into that role as well, for which it was totally unsuited. Pilot Alexander E. Shvarev recalled: &quot;The Mig was perfect at altitudes of 4,000 m and above. But at lower altitudes it was, as they say, &#x27;a cow&#x27;. That was the first weakness. The second was its armament: weapons failure dogged this aircraft. The third weakness was its gunsights, which were inaccurate: that&#x27;s why we closed in as much as we could and fired point blank&quot;.

On 22 June 1941, most MiG-3s and MiG-1s were in the border military districts of the Soviet Union. The Leningrad Military District had 164, 135 were in the Baltic Military District, 233 in the Western Special Military District, 190 in the Kiev Military District and 195 in the Odessa Military District for a total of 917 on hand, of which only 81 were non-operational. An additional 64 MiGs were assigned to Naval Aviation, 38 in the Air Force of the Baltic Fleet and 26 in the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet.

The 4th and 55th Fighter Regiments had most of the MiG-3s assigned to the Odessa Military District and their experiences on the first day of the war may be taken as typical. The 4th, an experienced unit, shot down a Romanian Bristol Blenheim reconnaissance bomber, confirmed by postwar research, and lost one aircraft which crashed into an obstacle on takeoff. The 55th was much less experienced with the MiG-3 and claimed three aircraft shot down, although recent research confirms only one German Henschel Hs 126 was 40 per cent damaged, and suffered three pilots killed and nine aircraft lost. The most unusual case was the pair of MiG-3s dispatched from the 55th on a reconnaissance mission to Ploieşti that failed to properly calculate their fuel consumption and both were forced to land when they ran out of fuel.

Most of the MiG-3s assigned to the interior military districts were transferred to the PVO where their lack of performance at low altitudes was not so important. On 10 July 299 were assigned to the PVO, the bulk of them belonging to the 6th PVO Corps at Moscow, while only 293 remained with the VVS, and 60 with the Naval Air Forces, a total of only 652 despite deliveries of several hundred aircraft. By 1 October, on the eve of the German offensive towards Moscow codenamed Operation Typhoon, only 257 were assigned to VVS units, 209 to the PVO, and 46 to the Navy, a total of only 512, a decrease of 140 fighters since 10 July, despite deliveries of over a thousand aircraft in the intervening period. By 5 December, the start of the Soviet counter-offensive that drove the Germans back from the gates of Moscow, the Navy had 33 MiGs on hand, the VVS 210 and the PVO 309. This was a total of 552, an increase of only 40 aircraft from 1 October.

Over the winter of 1941–42 the Soviets transferred all of the remaining MiG-3s to the Navy and PVO so that on 1 May 1942 none were left on strength with the VVS. By 1 May 1942, Naval Aviation had 37 MiGs on strength, while the PVO had 323 on hand on 10 May. By 1 June 1944, the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO, which reported only 17 on its own strength, and all of those were gone by 1 January 1945. Undoubtedly more remained in training units and the like, but none were assigned to combat units by then.

Even with the MiG-3&#x27;s limitations, Aleksandr Pokryshkin, the third-leading Soviet, and Allied, ace of the war, with 53 official air victories (plus six shared), recorded a number of those victories while flying a MiG-3 at the beginning of the war. He later recalled:
“Its designers rarely succeeded in matching both the fighter&#x27;s flight characteristics with its firepower… the operational advantage of the MiG-3 seemed to be obscured by its certain defects. However, these advantages could undoubtedly be exploited by a pilot able to discover them”.

==Variants==
There were several attempts to re-engine the aircraft with the engine it was originally designed for, the Mikulin AM-37. This was designated the MiG-7, and one MiG-3 was converted to evaluate the engine in May 1941. It proved to have poor longitudinal stability and the powerplant itself still had a number of problems. The German invasion the following month caused the cancellation of the development of the AM-37 as Mikulin&#x27;s resources were required for the AM-35 and AM-38 engines already in production.

To improve the low-level performance of the MiG-3, one aircraft was tested with the AM-38 engine used by the Il-2 in July 1941. It proved to be faster than the normal MiG-3 at sea level and was more maneuverable as well. It was recommended for production after passing its State acceptance trials in September, provided that a cure for the engine&#x27;s tendency to overheat in ambient temperatures above was found. However the sole prototype was shot down on 5 October during flight tests and it was decided not to proceed with the idea as all AM-38 production was allocated to the Il-2. Ironically, later in the war, about 80 MiG-3s were reengined with AM-38s to make them airworthy again. Many of these were rearmed with two 20 mm ShVAK cannon as well.

On 13 May 1941 the NKAP ordered the OKO to convert a MiG-3 to use the Shvetsov ASh-82A radial engine then entering production. The resulting aircraft had a variety of names, including I-210, MiG-3-82, Samolet IKh or Izdeliye 65. The design was a failure, but was promising enough to continue the program as the I-211.

A variety of other tests and other projects were conducted using MiG-3s. Leading edge slats were evaluated in 1941 although they were not fitted on production aircraft, but were used by the I-210. A six-bladed propeller was fitted on one aircraft to increase thrust at high altitude to enable the fighter to catch the high-flying Junkers Ju 86P aircraft then overflying Moscow. A new propeller hub was made that mounted six standard VISh-61 blades, but nothing more is known of the project. Four aircraft were converted to carry AFA-I cameras for evaluation and a fifth was then converted to evaluate all the improvements learned from the first four. It was approved for use after trials at the NII VVS. To improve their service ceiling two aircraft were reduced in weight to , but no further details are known other than one reached a height of .

There was also a proposal in 1941 to use the MiG-3 as part of a Zveno combination with a Petlyakov Pe-8 mother ship. The four-engined bomber would carry two MiG-3SPB (&quot;Skorostnoy Pikeeruyushchiy Bombardirovshchik&quot;—Fast Dive Bomber) fighters, modified to carry a FAB-250 bomb under each wing, close to the target and would then release them to conduct the attack after which they would fly back to the nearest friendly airbase. Some preliminary work was done before the Germans invaded, but it was abandoned afterwards due to the pressure of other work. The combination was estimated to have a maximum speed of and a range of .

<doc id="534701" wikidata="Q290248" url="?curid=534701" title="Pylorus">
<text>The pylorus ( or ) connects the stomach to the duodenum. The pylorus is considered as having two parts, the &quot;pyloric antrum&quot; (opening to the body of the stomach) and the &quot;pyloric canal&quot; (opening to the duodenum). The &quot;pyloric canal&quot; ends as the &quot;pyloric orifice&quot;, which marks the junction between the stomach and the duodenum. The orifice is surrounded by a sphincter, a band of muscle, called the &quot;pyloric sphincter&quot;.
The word &quot;pylorus&quot; comes from Greek πυλωρός, via Latin. The word &quot;pylorus&quot; in Greek means &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, related to &quot;gate&quot; () and is thus linguistically related to the word &quot;pylon&quot;.

== Structure ==
The pylorus is the furthest part of the stomach that connects to the duodenum. It is divided into two parts, the &quot;antrum&quot;, which connects to the body of the stomach, and the &quot;pyloric canal&quot;, which connects to the duodenum.

=== Antrum ===
The antrum also called the &quot;gastric antrum&quot; or the &quot;pyloric antrum&quot; is the initial portion of the pyloric region. It is near the bottom of the stomach, proximal to the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the duodenum. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the pyloric canal by a slight groove.

=== Canal ===
The pyloric canal () is the opening between the stomach and the duodenum. The wall thickness of the pyloric canal is up to 3 millimeters (mm) in infants younger than 30 days, and up to 8 mm in adults.

=== Sphincter ===
The pyloric sphincter, surrounding the pyloric orifice is a strong ring of smooth muscle at the end of the pyloric canal which lets food pass from the stomach to the duodenum. It acts as a valve, controlling the outflow of gastric contents into the duodenum and release of chyme. Its function is modulated by both the central and enteric nervous systems. It receives sympathetic innervation from the celiac ganglion.

=== Histology ===
Under microscopy, the pylorus contains numerous glands, including gastric pits, which constitute about half the depth of the pyloric mucosa. They consist of two or three short closed tubes opening into a common duct or mouth. These tubes are wavy, and are about one-half the length of the duct. The duct is lined by columnar cells, continuous with the epithelium lining the surface of the mucous membrane of the stomach, the tubes by shorter and more cubical cell which are finely granular. The glands contain mucous cells and G cells that secrete gastrin.

The pylorus also contains scattered parietal cells and neuroendocrine cells. These endocrine cells include D cells, which release somatostatin, responsible for shutting off acid secretion. (There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)
Unstriated muscles, which are entirely involuntary, are located at the pylorus.

== Function ==
The pylorus is one component of the gastrointestinal tract. Food from the stomach, as chyme, passes through the pylorus to the duodenum. The pylorus, through the pyloric sphincter, regulates entry of food from the stomach into the duodenum.

== Clinical significance ==
In such conditions as stomach cancer, tumours may partly block the pyloric canal. A special tube can be implanted surgically to connect the stomach to the duodenum so as to facilitate the passage of food from one to the other. The surgery to place this tube is called a gastroduodenostomy.

=== Stenosis ===

Pyloric stenosis refers to a pylorus that is narrow. This is due to congenital hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter. The lumen of the pylorus is narrower, and less food is able to pass through. This problem is often detected in the early weeks of life. When it is present, a newborn baby may projectile vomit after eating, but despite vomiting remain hungry. Pyloric stenosis may be managed by the insertion of a stent, or through surgical cutting of the pyloric sphincter, a &quot;pyloromyotomy&quot;.

<text>Sydney Theatre Company (STC) is an Australian theatre company based in Sydney, New South Wales. The company performs in the Wharf Theatre at Dawes Point in The Rocks area of Sydney as well as the Roslyn Packer Theatre (formerly Sydney Theatre) and the Sydney Opera House Drama Theatre.

==History==
Sydney Theatre Company was formed in December 1978, following the closure of the Old Tote Theatre Company the month before. The then premier, Neville Wran, approached Elizabeth Butcher who had been seconded from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) to administer the Old Tote and asked her to set up a new state theatre company to perform in the drama theatre of the Sydney Opera House. Butcher established its legal identity and managerial structure and proposed the name &#x27;Sydney Theatre Company&#x27; with John Clark (director of NIDA as the artistic adviser of the first season, five theatre companies were invited to produce six plays to be presented by STC as the 1979 interim season in the drama theatre. The first production, by the Paris Company, was &quot;A Cheery Soul&quot; by Patrick White (an Australian Nobel Laureate for Literature), directed by Jim Sharman and featuring Robyn Nevin as Miss Docker.

In June 1979, Richard Wherrett, then one of Nimrod Theatre&#x27;s co-artistic directors, was appointed artistic director of STC to plan and organise activities for the 1980 season. The first STC-produced play was &quot;The Sunny South&quot; (1 January 1980) by George Darrell with music by Terence Clarke, directed by Richard Wherrett and assisted by John Gaden.

In its early years the company operated out of several rented premises around the city, producing 38 productions in five separate venues. Elizabeth Butcher, STC administrator, was given the task of finding one location that could house all the activities of the company, and a theatre. After an extensive search, Butcher had the vision to propose the derelict Walsh Bay Wharf 4/5 as STC&#x27;s new home, immediately envisaging the capacity of the building to fulfil all requirements of space, location and additional venue. On 12 September 1983, the premier, Neville Wran, announced that the state government had approved the expenditure of $3.5 million to finance the project. The 60-year-old ironbark timber wharf warehouse was converted into premises suitable for creating, producing, performing and enjoying theatre.

The Wharf was officially handed over to STC in a plaque-unveiling ceremony on 13 December 1984. In 1985, The Wharf, by architects Vivian Fraser in association with NSW Govt Architect JW Thomson, won the Sir John Sulman Medal awarded by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) for a work of excellence in public and commercial architecture. The first STC production in the Wharf Theatre (now Wharf 1), 17 January 1985, was &quot;Late Arrivals&quot; by Pamela van Amstel and directed by Wayne Harrison in his directorial debut. (Harrison went on to become the second artistic director of the company, in 1990.) The play was part of a season of one-act plays called Shorts at the Wharf.

Other performing arts companies and organisations later moved into the premises at The Wharf, including Sydney Dance Company, Ausdance, Sydney Philharmonia Choirs, Gondwana Choirs, Sydney Children&#x27;s Choir, Australian Theatre for Young People, and Bangarra Dance Theatre. Nearly 25 years later The Wharf was presented the RAIA 25-Year Award for Enduring Architecture.

Directors working regularly for STC include Gale Edwards, Barrie Kosky, David Berthold, Neil Armfield, Benedict Andrews and Kip Williams. Many Australian actors who would later find wider success, such as Hugo Weaving, Geoffrey Rush, Cate Blanchett, Jacqueline McKenzie, Richard Roxburgh and Toni Collette, established their careers in STC productions.

Jo Dyer was executive producer of STC for ten years.

In January 2024, Alan Joyce who was also the CEO of Qantas, resigned.

==Greening the Wharf==
The Sydney Theatre Company operates out of a heritage site of the wharf area of Sydney Harbour. Under the leadership of Blanchett and Upton, STC initiated a comprehensive large scale environmental program called &quot;Greening the Wharf&quot;, investing in solar energy, rainwater harvesting, energy efficiency measures and best practice waste management. The program goes beyond infrastructure projects to include employees, environmentally responsible theatre production, community engagement and education. The program won two Green Globe Awards.

<text>The Miles M.9 Master was a British two-seat monoplane advanced trainer designed and built by aviation company Miles Aircraft Ltd. It was inducted in large numbers into both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm (FAA) during the Second World War.

The Master can trace its origins back to the earlier M.9 Kestrel demonstrator aircraft. Following the failure of the rival de Havilland Don as a satisfactory trainer aircraft, the RAF ordered 500 &quot;M9A Master&quot; advanced trainers to meet its needs. Once in service, it provided a fast, strong and fully aerobatic aircraft that functioned as an excellent introduction to the high performance British fighter aircraft of the day: the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane. Throughout its production life, thousands of aircraft and various variants of the Master were produced, the latter being largely influenced by engine availability. Numerous Masters were modified to enable their use as glider tows. The Master also served as the basis for the Miles Martinet, a dedicated target tug adopted by the RAF.

Perhaps the most radical use of the aircraft was the M.24 Master Fighter. Armed with six 0.303 inch (7.7 mm) machine guns, it was intended for mass production as an emergency fighter during the Battle of Britain; this model did not ultimately see combat. Ordinary trainer models could also be fitted with armaments, including a single .303 in Vickers machine gun and eight bombs, for training purposes only. Beyond the British air services, other nations also chose to adopt the Master, including the South African Air Force, United States Army Air Force, Irish Air Corps, Royal Egyptian Air Force, Turkish Air Force, and the Portuguese Air Force. While thousands of Masters were manufactured, no complete examples have been preserved.

==Development==
===Background===
The &quot;M.9A Master I&quot; was based on the privately developed M.9 Kestrel trainer that was first demonstrated at the Hendon Air show in July 1937, although this aircraft never entered production. The M.9 Kestrel, powered by a single Rolls-Royce Kestrel XVI V-12 engine, capable of generating up to 745 hp (555 kW), could attain a maximum speed of 296 mph (477 km/h). The British Air Ministry had previously selected the de Havilland Don multi-role trainer to meet Specification T.6/36, which called for an advanced trainer aircraft; however, this aircraft would prove to be a failure. Still requiring an aircraft to perform the duties intended for the Don, following the prototype Master (serial N3300) the RAF placed a large order on 11 June 1938 for 500 examples of a modified version of the Kestrel (to specification 16/38), designated M.9A with the service name Master, at a cost of £2 million. This was claimed to be Britain&#x27;s largest ever contract for a training aircraft at the time.

Upon receipt of this order, Miles had the prototype M.9 rebuilt into a representative prototype for the Master. Alterations included the installation of a lower-powered (715 hp (535 kW)) Kestrel XXX engine, of which there were large surplus stocks available, along with extensive revisions to the airframe, which involved the adoption of a new cockpit canopy, a modified rear fuselage and tail, along with the repositioning of the radiator from underneath the nose to the underside of the wing&#x27;s centre-section. These modifications came at the cost of a significantly reduced maximum speed over the M.9; despite this, the Master was a relatively fast and manoeuvrable trainer. Miles had designed the Master to fulfil their vision of an effective trainer aircraft, being one that could match the performance of, and possess similar characteristics to, the frontline RAF monoplane fighters of the day, these being the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane.

===Into flight===
On 31 March 1939, the first true production Master I conducted its maiden flight. The first production examples were delivered during late July of that year. The Master had entered RAF service just prior to the start of the Second World War. Eventually, 900 Mk. I and Mk. IA Masters were constructed. This total included 26 built as the M.24 Master Fighter which were modified to a single-seat configuration, and armed with six .303 in machine guns for use as an emergency fighter; this model never saw combat use.

When production of the Kestrel engine ceased, a new variant of the Master was designed that used an air-cooled Bristol Mercury XX radial engine, capable of producing 870 hp (650 kW), instead. Thus configured, on 30 October 1939, the first &quot;M.19 Master II&quot; prototype made its first flight; 1,748 aircraft were eventually built. After the Lend-Lease programme provided a supply of engines from the United States to Britain, a third variant of the Master, designated &quot;M.27 Master III&quot;, was designed, which was powered by the American-built Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp Junior, a two-row radial engine that could generate 825 hp (615 kW). A total of 602 Master IIIs were constructed.

In a typical trainer configuration, the Master was equipped to carry eight practice bombs, plus a single .303 in Vickers machine gun that was mounted in the front fuselage. During 1942, it was decided to have the wings of all variants clipped by three feet (c. one metre); this modification reduced the stress imposed upon the wings while also increasing the aircraft&#x27;s manoeuvrability.

===Production===

A total of 3,249 Masters were built by Phillips and Powis Aircraft Limited (as Miles was known until 1943) at Woodley, Berkshire; South Marston, near Swindon, Wiltshire; and Doncaster. This was the largest number produced of any Miles aircraft type prior to production of the newer Miles Martinet taking precedence during 1942.

The mass production of this aeroplane at Woodley required a major expansion of the original Phillips &amp; Powis factory, which was officially opened on 27 January 1939 by the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Kingsley Wood. This facility was outfitted with a pioneering moving track assembly line, which is believed to be the first such facility in a British aircraft factory. A similar facility was also installed in the company&#x27;s shadow factory at South Marston by the end of 1940.

==Design==
The Miles Master was a tandem-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane, powered by a single reciprocating engine. Initial models used the Kestrel XXX engine; capable of providing up to 745 hp (555 kW), this powerplant enabled the aircraft to achieve a maximum speed of 296 mph (477 km/h), which reportedly made the Master as fast as the single-seat biplane fighters of 1935. The inverted gull wing of the Master was a major distinguishing factor of the aircraft and was adopted – despite higher production costs – for its performance benefits, permitting the stowage of both the retractable undercarriage and fuel tanks; aside from this shaping, the wing&#x27;s design largely conformed with traditional approaches. It featured hydraulically-actuated split flaps along its trailing edge, their position being indicated electronically on the cockpit&#x27;s instrumentation panel. The wing&#x27;s centre-section also accommodated a single machine gun.

While the Master had incorporated relatively advanced aerodynamic characteristics (intended to mimic frontline fighters) for a contemporary trainer aircraft, it used a conventional structure, comprising an oval-section fuselage covered by a plywood skin, featuring a semi-monocoque approach. Forward of the tandem cockpits, the nose is strengthened by a metal former that provides protection against nose-overs, a common occurrence amongst trainee pilots when flying aircraft with &#x27;tail dragger&#x27; conventional undercarriage. The tail section had an orthodox cantilever structure, the tailplane being mounted directly on top of the fuselage; the tailplane&#x27;s aerodynamics were designed to facilitate easy spin recovery. The Kestrel engine is mounted on tubular steel bearings, to facilitate engine removal for ease of maintenance through four main bolts along with the connecting leads. Further maintenance savings were made by de-rating the engine power, giving a longer interval between overhauls.

The Master was furnished with a constant-speed propeller, which was interchangeable between Rotol and de Havilland units. The Kestrel engine of early-built aircraft incorporated various auxiliary drives to power both vacuum and hydraulic pumps, along with an air compressor and a 500-watt electrical generator. Cooling for the water and oil systems was provided via a duct running underneath the fuselage. Fuel was housed in a pair of tanks, each containing up to , accommodated within the wings; the oil tank is mounted behind a fireproof bulkhead while the water tank is mounted in front of the engine. The retractable undercarriage is operated via two separate hydraulic systems along with a hand-pump as backup; the brakes are also hydraulically-actuated.

The cockpit of the Master was designed with considerable attention to best facilitate its use as a trainer aircraft, including for ease of use and comfort. The positions of the two flying crew, the student in front and the instructor behind, was staggered; the rear position was 12 inches higher to provide the instructor with greater visibility. Mid-flight, an instructor could disconnect several of the student pilot&#x27;s controls, such as the brakes, using various cut-outs. The forward windscreen is composed of moulded Perspex and furnished with a reflector-type gun sight, providing an optically-perfect view of a target. Two small panels can be opened to aid visibility while flying in poor weather conditions, sun blinds are also incorporated. Catches on either side of the sliding canopy allow for the panels to be rapidly detached, facilitating faster bailing-out during an emergency. Other emergency equipment included a Graviner fire extinguisher mounted behind the rear seat and emergency hydraulic controls set into the floor of the cockpit.

==Operational history==
Typical service use of the Master primarily revolved around &quot;(Pilot) Advanced Flying Units&quot;, where they were used for training aircrew in preparation for service with frontline squadrons. Amongst other parts of the training syllabus, pilots would often be first exposed to fighter tactics while flying the aircraft. By 1942, advertisements claimed that the Master was being flown by every RAF fighter pilot-in-training.

Several hundred Master IIs were either delivered in, or subsequently converted to, a configuration that allowed their use in the glider-towing role. Such aircraft would have the lower portion of their rudder cut away to allow fitting of a towing hook. Starting in 1942, Miles Masters were extensively used as tugs for General Aircraft Hotspur gliders at various Glider Training Schools. Examples were also operated by multiple Anti-aircraft Co-operation Units of the RAF as a liaison aircraft with British Army units.

Initially, the type was mainly used for training, thus few aircraft entered squadron service. Known deployments were to No. 287 Squadron between February and August 1942, to No. 286 Squadron from November 1944 to February 1945, and to No. 613 Squadron between August 1941 and October 1943.

The Master II was also used for target tug purposes at the Central Gunnery School whilst the School was based at RAF Sutton Bridge from April 1942 to March 1944. In this role, they pulled the drogue targets required for aerial gunnery training by pupils at the Pilot Gunnery Instructors&#x27; Training Wing. The Miles Martinet, a derivative of the Master, was a developed specifically to be a target tug and would see widespread use in this capacity.

RAF stocks were frequently diverted to support several of the air services of the Allies and other non-hostile nations. Such diversions included 426 aircraft to the South African Air Force, 52 to the Fleet Air Arm, nine to the United States Army Air Force units based in Britain, 23 to the Royal Egyptian Air Force, 23 to Turkish Air Force, two to Portuguese Air Force, and fourteen to the Irish Air Corps.

Despite having been produced in the thousands, there are no known surviving aircraft of the type today, although a few outer wings and other parts are held by several aviation museums in Britain.

<text>Cone cells or cones are photoreceptor cells in the retina of the vertebrate eye. Cones are active in daylight conditions and enable Photopic vision, as opposed to rod cells, which are active in dim light and enable Scotopic vision. Most vertebrates (including humans) have several classes of cones, each sensitive to a different part of the visible spectrums of light. The comparison of the responses of different cone cell classes enables color vision. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye (vs ~92 million rods), with the highest concentration occurring towards the macula and most densely packed in the fovea centralis, a diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones. Conversely, like rods, they are absent from the optic disc, contributing to the blind spot.

Cones are less sensitive to light than the rod cells in the retina (which support vision at low light levels), but allow the perception of color. They are also able to perceive finer detail and more rapid changes in images because their response times to stimuli are faster than those of rods. In humans, cones are normally one of three types: S-cones, M-cones and L-cones, with each type bearing a different opsin: OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW respectively. These cones are sensitive to visible wavelengths of light that correspond to short-wavelength, medium-wavelength and longer-wavelength light respectively. Because humans usually have three kinds of cones with different photopsins, which have different response curves and thus respond to variation in color in different ways, humans have trichromatic vision. Being color blind can change this, and there have been some verified reports of people with four types of cones, giving them tetrachromatic vision.
The three pigments responsible for detecting light have been shown to vary in their exact chemical composition due to genetic mutation; different individuals will have cones with different color sensitivity.

==Structure==

===Classes===
Most vertebrates have several different classes of cone cells, differentiated primarily by the specific photopsin expressed within. The number of cone classes determines the degree of color vision. Vertebrates with one, two, three or four classes of cones possess monochromacy, dichromacy, trichromacy and tetrachromacy, respectively.

Humans normally have three classes of cones, designated L, M and S for the long, medium and short wavelengths of the visible spectrum to which they are most sensitive. L cones respond most strongly to light of the longer red wavelengths, peaking at about . M cones, respond most strongly to yellow to green medium-wavelength light, peaking at . S cones respond most strongly to blue short-wavelength light, peaking at , and make up only around 2% of the cones in the human retina. The peak wavelengths of L, M, and S cones occur in the ranges of , , and nm, respectively, depending on the individual. The typical human photopsins are coded for by the genes OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW. The CIE 1931 color space is an often-used model of spectral sensitivities of the three cells of a typical human.

===Histology===

Cone cells are shorter but wider than rod cells. They are typically long, and their diameter varies from . They are narrowest at the fovea, where they are the most tightly packed. The S cone spacing is slightly larger than the others.

Like rods, each cone cell has a synaptic terminal, inner and outer segments, as well as an interior nucleus and various mitochondria. The synaptic terminal forms a synapse with a neuron bipolar cell. The inner and outer segments are connected by a cilium. The inner segment contains organelles and the cell&#x27;s nucleus, while the outer segment contains the light-absorbing photopsins, and is shaped like a cone, giving the cell its name.

The outer segments of cones have invaginations of their cell membranes that create stacks of membranous disks. Photopigments exist as transmembrane proteins within these disks, which provide more surface area for light to affect the pigments. In cones, these disks are attached to the outer membrane, whereas they are pinched off and exist separately in rods. Neither rods nor cones divide, but their membranous disks wear out and are worn off at the end of the outer segment, to be consumed and recycled by phagocytic cells.

===Distribution===
While rods outnumber cones in most parts of the retina, the fovea, responsible for sharp central vision, consists almost entirely of cones. The distribution of photoreceptors in the retina is called the retinal mosaic, which can be determined using photobleaching. This is done by exposing dark-adapted retina to a certain wavelength of light that paralyzes the particular type of cone sensitive to that wavelength for up to thirty minutes from being able to dark-adapt, making it appear white in contrast to the grey dark-adapted cones when a picture of the retina is taken. The results illustrate that S cones are randomly placed and appear much less frequently than the M and L cones. The ratio of M and L cones varies greatly among different people with regular vision (e.g. values of 75.8% L with 20.0% M versus 50.6% L with 44.2% M in two male subjects).

==Function==
The difference in the signals received from the three cone types allows the brain to perceive a continuous range of colors through the opponent process of color vision. Rod cells have a peak sensitivity at , roughly halfway between the peak sensitivities of the S and M cones.

All of the receptors contain the protein photopsin. Variations in its conformation cause differences in the optimum wavelengths absorbed.

The color yellow, for example, is perceived when the L cones are stimulated slightly more than the M cones, and the color red is perceived when the L cones are stimulated significantly more than the M cones. Similarly, blue and violet hues are perceived when the S receptor is stimulated more. S Cones are most sensitive to light at wavelengths around . At moderate to bright light levels where the cones function, the eye is more sensitive to yellowish-green light than other colors because this stimulates the two most common (M and L) of the three kinds of cones almost equally. At lower light levels, where only the rod cells function, the sensitivity is greatest at a blueish-green wavelength.

Cones also tend to possess a significantly elevated visual acuity because each cone cell has a lone connection to the optic nerve, therefore, the cones have an easier time telling that two stimuli are isolated. Separate connectivity is established in the
inner plexiform layer so that each connection is parallel.

The response of cone cells to light is also directionally nonuniform, peaking at a direction that receives light from the center of the pupil; this effect is known as the Stiles–Crawford effect.

S cones may play a role in the regulation of the circadian system and the secretion of melatonin, but this role is not clear yet. Any potential role of the S cones in the circadian system would be secondary to the better established role of melanopsin (see also Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell). 

=== Color afterimage ===
Sensitivity to a prolonged stimulation tends to decline over time, leading to neural adaptation. An interesting effect occurs when staring at a particular color for a minute or so. Such action leads to an exhaustion of the cone cells that respond to that color – resulting in the afterimage. This vivid color aftereffect can last for a minute or more.

<text>Sir Archibald Hector McIndoe (4 May 1900 – 11 April 1960) was a New Zealand plastic surgeon who worked for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He improved the treatment and rehabilitation of badly burned aircrew.

==Early life==
Archibald McIndoe was born 4 May 1900 in Forbury, in Dunedin, New Zealand, into a family of four. His father was John McIndoe, a printer and his mother was the artist Mabel McIndoe née Hill. He had three brothers and one sister. McIndoe studied at Otago Boys&#x27; High School and later medicine at the University of Otago. After his graduation he became a house surgeon at Waikato Hospital.

In 1924, McIndoe was awarded the first New Zealand Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in the United States to study pathological anatomy. The fellowship was for an unmarried doctor and as McIndoe had recently married Adonia Aitkin they had to keep their marriage secret and he sailed without her. When it was no longer possible to maintain the secret she joined him 12 months later. He worked in the clinic as First Assistant in Pathological Anatomy 1925–1927 and published several papers on chronic liver disease. Impressed with his skill, Lord Moynihan suggested a career in Britain, and in 1930 McIndoe moved to London.

When McIndoe could not find work, his cousin Sir Harold Gillies, an otolaryngologist specialising in plastic surgery (who now has an operation for reducing a broken cheekbone named after himself), invited him to join the private practice he ran with Rainsford Mowlem and offered him a job at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, where he became a clinical assistant. In 1932, McIndoe received a permanent appointment as a General Surgeon and Lecturer at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

In 1934, McIndoe received a Fellowship of the American College of Surgeons, where he worked until 1939. That year, he became a consulting plastic surgeon to the Royal North Stafford Infirmary and to Croydon General Hospital. In 1938, he was appointed consultant in plastic surgery to the Royal Air Force.

==Second World War==

When the Second World War broke out, plastic surgery was largely divided on service lines. Gillies went to Rooksdown House near Basingstoke, which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; Tommy Kilner (who had worked with Gillies during the First World War, and who now has a surgical instrument named after him, the kilner cheek retractor), went to Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Roehampton, and Mowlem to St Albans. McIndoe moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery. There, he treated very deep burns and serious facial disfigurement like loss of eyelids. With McIndoe&#x27;s support, patients at the hospital formed the Guinea Pig Club, a social club and mutual support network: members included Richard Hillary, Geoffrey Page, Bill Foxley and Jimmy Edwards. The club grew to 649 members by the end of the war.

McIndoe was a brilliant and quick surgeon. He not only developed new techniques for treating badly burned faces and hands but also recognised the importance of the rehabilitation of the casualties and particularly of social reintegration back into normal life. He disposed of the &quot;convalescent uniforms&quot; and let the patients use their service uniforms instead. With the help of two friends, Neville and Elaine Blond, he also encouraged the locals to support the patients and invite them to their homes. McIndoe referred to the patients as &quot;his boys&quot;, while the staff called him &quot;the Boss&quot; or &quot;the Maestro&quot;.

Important work included development of the walking-stalk skin graft, and the discovery that immersion in saline promoted healing as well as improving survival rates for victims with extensive burns – this was a serendipitous discovery drawn from observation of differential healing rates in pilots who had come down on land and in the sea.

==Later years==
After the end of the war, McIndoe returned to private practice. His speciality was the &quot;McIndoe nose&quot;.

McIndoe was created CBE in 1944 and after the war he received a number of British and foreign honours, including a &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; (Commander of the Legion of Honour) and was knighted in 1947 for his remarkable work on restoring the minds and bodies of the burnt young pilots of the Second World War through his innovative reconstructive surgery techniques. That same year he visited East Africa for the first time, and took up farming on Kilimanjaro. In 1957, with two former pupils, Michael Wood and Tom Rees, he co-founded the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF).

He became a member of a council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1946 and its vice-president in 1958. His marriage to Adonia ended in 1953, and he married Constance Belchem in 1954. In 1958, McIndoe delivered the Bradshaw Lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons on the topic of the reconstruction of the burned face. He took part in the founding of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons (BAPS) and later served as its third President. The Guinea Pig Club continued to meet after the war, and McIndoe remained its President until his death.

==Death==
Archibald McIndoe died in his sleep of a heart attack on 11 April 1960, aged 59, in his house at 84 Albion Gate, London. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes were given the unique honour for a civilian of being buried at the Royal Air Force church of St Clement Danes in London.

==Personal life==
McIndoe married Adonia Aitkin of Dunedin on 31 July 1924. They had two daughters, Adonia and Vanora. They were divorced in 1953. In 1954, McIndoe married Constance Belchem, the former wife of Major-General R. F. K. Belchem.

==Legacy==
On 22 March 1961, the British Minister of Health opened the Blond McIndoe Centre named in his honour at the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead. The Blond McIndoe Centre, now named the Blond McIndoe Research Foundation, continues research into pioneering treatments to improve wound healing. The Blond McIndoe Research Foundation is a registered charity.

The McIndoe Burns Centre at Queen Victoria Hospital was dedicated in 1994, and there is a burns victim support group centred there which also bears his name.

Specialist science laboratories at Otago Boys&#x27; High School, built in 1967, are named in his honour. The school later named one of its houses after McIndoe after the introduction of a house system in 2013.

The Gillies McIndoe Research Institute, a major medical research centre in Wellington, New Zealand, is named in honour of McIndoe and his cousin Sir Harold Gillies.

In 2000, an English Heritage blue plaque was erected on McIndoe&#x27;s former London home at Avenue Court, Draycott Avenue, Chelsea.

A bronze monument commemorating McIndoe by Martin Jennings, whose own father was one of his patients, was unveiled by Princess Anne in East Grinstead High Street, in front of Sackville College, in 2014. It depicts the standing McIndoe resting his hands reassuringly on the shoulders of a seated injured airman, whose burned hands are clawed together, and whose scarred face is turned to one side. The two figures are encircled by a stone bench. Jennings described the airman as &quot;looking up at the sky he cannot fly in any more&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Deadline&quot; reported, a film named &quot;The Guinea Pig Club&quot; by Roger Donaldson has been made on McIndoe as a maverick surgeon in World War II and his radical methods of healing severely burned bodies.

<text>Jeana Lee Yeager (born May 18, 1952) is an American aviator. She co-piloted, along with Dick Rutan, the first non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world in the Rutan Voyager aircraft from December 14 to 23, 1986. The flight took 9 days, 3 minutes, and 44 seconds and covered 24,986 miles (40,211 km), almost doubling the old distance record set by a Boeing B-52 strategic bomber in 1962.

==Early life and career==
Jeana Lee Yeager was born on May 18, 1952, in Fort Worth, Texas, to Royal Leland &quot;Lee&quot; Yeager (March 12, 1918 - March 17, 2001) and Alice Evaree Snider ( Harris; October 21, 1924 – February 5, 2013). As a child, she and her family variously lived in Garland, Texas, Oxnard, California, and Commerce, Texas. Following graduation from high school, Yeager, at age 19, married a police officer; they divorced five years later. She then worked as a draftsman and surveyor for a geothermal energy company in Santa Rosa, California. In 1978, Yeager obtained her private pilot&#x27;s license while still living in Santa Rosa.

Yeager worked for Robert Truax while he was developing a reusable spacecraft. She met Dick Rutan in 1980 and they soon both set distance records in the Rutan VariEze and Long-EZ planes, designed by Dick&#x27;s brother Burt Rutan. In early 1982, Yeager set a new women&#x27;s speed record for the 2,000-kilometer closed course and in the fall of 1984 using the VariEze, she set the open-distance record of 2,427.1 statute miles.

Despite having the same last name, Jeana Yeager is not related to fellow aviator and test pilot General Chuck Yeager.

==Round-the-world flight==

Yeager and Dick Rutan decided to attempt to fly around the world without refueling. They formed Voyager Aircraft, Inc., and Burt Rutan began designing the aircraft. Initially unable to find a commercial sponsor, Yeager started the Voyager Impressive People (VIP) program which became the major source of money to build, test, and fly the aircraft. By mid-1986, Voyager was ready for the flight. Yeager flew as co-pilot on the 216-hour flight and set a world absolute distance record. This was the first time a woman had been listed in an absolute category.

Dick Rutan and Voyager sued Yeager in 1995, alleging that she had misappropriated memorabilia and funds from Voyager. The lawsuit was dropped in 1996.

==Awards==
In recognition of the 1986 Voyager flight, Yeager received both the Harmon and National Air and Space Museum (NASM) trophies, the FAI De la Vaulx Medal, the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Ronald Reagan and the Collier Trophy (becoming its first female recipient). She shared the Presidential Citizens Medal and Collier Trophy with Dick and Burt Rutan (as well as the NASM Trophy and De la Vaulx Medal with Dick). Yeager shared the 1985 Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) Jack Northrop Award and 1987 SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award with Voyager pilot Dick Rutan. She was also awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1988. In 2013, &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked Yeager and Dick Rutan No. 33 on their list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.

<text>Schweinfurt is a (district) in the northwestern part of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Bad Kissingen, Rhön-Grabfeld, Haßberge, Bamberg, Kitzingen, Würzburg and Main-Spessart. The district-free city Schweinfurt is surrounded by the district.

==Geography==
Primary rivers in the district are the Main and the Wern. The district is located between several hill chains - Haßberge to the east, the Rhön in the northwest, the Spessart to the west and the Steigerwald in the southeast.

==History==
The area of the district became part of Bavaria in 1814. 
In 1972 parts of the previous district Gerolzhofen (including the town Gerolzhofen) were merged with the district.

== Archaeology ==
In July 2022, archaeologists announced the discovery of a 3000-year-old clay figurine that might represent a prehistoric female water goddess. The 19 cm tall clay figurine&#x27;s carefully modeled eye sockets, nose, lips, and chin are obviously visible and attractive. There are 5 perforated holes at the each side of the head possibly representing a hood decorated with metal rings. Clay figurine was supposedly 10 cm higher in its original shape because its anterior surface of the upper side was missing. The artifact was cleaned by using airbrush water technology and it is currently being studied by the Bavarian State Office for the Preservation of Monuments.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the imperial eagle in the top part as a symbol of the former imperial city Schweinfurt. The bottom part of the coat of arms shows the symbol of the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, which ruled a big part of the district until 1803.

<doc id="534751" wikidata="Q605204" url="?curid=534751" title="Bad Taste">
<text>Bad Taste is a 1987 New Zealand science-fiction comedy horror film directed, produced and filmed by Peter Jackson, who also starred in it and co-wrote the screenplay, along with Tony Hiles and Ken Hammon. Independently produced on a low budget, it is Jackson&#x27;s first feature film. Jackson and friends take on most of the key roles, both on and off-screen. The plotline sees aliens invade the fictional New Zealand village of Kaihoro to harvest humans for their intergalactic fast food franchise, where they face off against a four-man paramilitary force. The film was shot in Northern Wellington over the course of four years, and eventually received nearly a quarter of a million dollars in New Zealand Film Commission assistance, providing Jackson with the leverage necessary to advance in the film industry.

Since its release, &quot;Bad Taste&quot; has become a cult film and has received stronger reviews. It is regarded as a classic of New Zealand indie cinema. In 2008, British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;Bad Taste&quot; as the 416th greatest film ever made. 

==Plot==
After the town of Kaihoro&#x27;s entire population disappear, the Astro Investigation and Defence Service (AIDS) sends their agents Derek, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry to investigate. They find the town overrun by man-eating space aliens disguised as humans in blue shirts. Barry kills one of the aliens and is attacked by others. After Derek notifies Frank and Ozzy, he begins torturing Robert, an alien they caught earlier. Robert&#x27;s screaming attracts a number of aliens. Derek kills the would-be rescuers, but he is attacked by Robert and falls off a cliff ledge, to his presumed death.

Meanwhile, charity collector Giles passes through Kaihoro. He escapes Roberts&#x27; attack and comes to nearby house for help, only to get captured by another alien. Giles later wakes up in a tub of water filled with vegetables and is told he is about to be cooked and eaten. Derek wakes up in a seagull&#x27;s nest with a hole in his head, so uses a hat to keep his brains from leaking out.

That night, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry infiltrate the aliens&#x27; house and find a room filled with bloody cardboard boxes, likely containing the corpses of former Kaihoro residents. They kill an alien, and Frank wears its shirt to infiltrate their meeting. He learns that the victims have been harvested for food and hears of their recent hostage, Giles. The alien later dine on Robert&#x27;s vomit, and the disguised (and disgusted) Frank has to follow suit. He escapes and tells the others of the plan. They save Giles as the aliens sleep.

At sunrise, they try to leave but are attacked by the aliens, and a gunfight ensues. Derek emerges and joins the fight, using his belt as a headband when the hat is shot off. He grabs a chainsaw from the boot of his car and heads for the aliens&#x27; house. As the group leaves with Giles, the alien leader (Lord Crumb) and his followers morph into their true form and follow. Ozzy uses a rocket launcher to explode Frank&#x27;s car, which has been overrun by aliens.

Frank and Ozzy hunt for Lord Crumb and kill many aliens along the way. Meanwhile, Derek kills an alien with his chainsaw and replaces the missing parts of his brain with its brain. An alien prepares to shoot Frank and Ozzy, but it is beheaded by Derek. Frank and Ozzy are shocked to see him alive, and see he has lost his mind.

After they escape the house, Lord Crumb shoots Ozzy in the leg and Frank fires his rocket launcher at the leader, but misses. Lord Crumb knocked out Derek; the house transforms into a giant space ship and blasts off into space.

On board, Derek looks out the window to see Earth. He ambushes Crumb and kills the alien with his chainsaw. He proclaims war on the alien, then puts on the alien leader&#x27;s skin and laughs maniacally as he rockets towards the alien planet. 

Back on Earth, the survivors drive away in Derek&#x27;s car.

==Production==
Much of the film was shot in and around Jackson&#x27;s home suburb of Pukerua Bay in northern Wellington, using a 25-year-old 16mm Bolex camera. Originally begun as a 20-minute short film called &quot;Roast of the Day&quot;,&quot;Bad Taste&quot; was shot primarily on weekends over the course of four years, at an initial cost of around $25,000. Toward the end of the shoot the New Zealand Film Commission invested around NZ$235,000 into the film to ensure its completion. Heavily influenced by special effects pioneer Tom Savini, Jackson incorporated many absurdly gory special effects.

Peter Jackson himself plays two acting roles. In one early scene halfway down a cliff, careful editing, utilising shots taken months apart, makes it possible for the two characters, Derek and the alien Robert (both played by Jackson), to fight one another.

&quot;Bad Taste&quot; begins Jackson&#x27;s penchant for using the Morris Minor in his films - Giles drives a Morris Minor. Subsequently, every car in &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; is a Morris Minor (including a limousine) and several are seen in &quot;Braindead&quot;.

A combination of blank firing firearms and homemade weapon props were used in the film. Most of the firearm props were made using recycled aluminium and wood. The actors also had to shake them to simulate the recoil. A flash and sound effect was added later during post production.

All the alien masks in the film were baked in Peter Jackson&#x27;s mother&#x27;s oven.

Kaihoro, the name of the town whose inhabitants are butchered, is a Māori word coined by Jackson and his crew early in the shooting of the film. It has two parts - &quot;kai&quot; which means food and &quot;horo&quot; which means town or village. Foodtown is also the name of a New Zealand chain of grocery stores. Kai horo in Te Reo Maori means &#x27;greedy&#x27; - but is made up of the words Kai (food) and horo (quickly) which, loosely translated, could be said to mean fast food, a play on the fate of the villagers.

The sheep in the film was to have played a larger role as a running gag, being surprisingly aggressive and chasing &quot;The Boys&quot; at various points throughout. This was reduced to the single sheep/rocket launcher moment of the final scene.

==Release==
The film sold to many countries after playing in the market at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. 
Despite its wide acclaim, the film failed to impress at the 1989 NZ Film and Television Awards, winning no awards. As well as this, a TVNZ executive spoke out the next day about whether or not the film industry needed films like &quot;Bad Taste&quot;. The film did however still win favour among the country&#x27;s cult film audiences. In France, the film received 29,339 admissions.

==Reception==
&quot;Bad Taste&quot; received generally positive reviews. Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, with praise being directed to the special effects. For AllMovie, Jason Buchanan wrote that &quot;Bad Taste&quot; was &quot;amazingly resourceful,&quot; but that it moves at such a &quot;hyperactive&quot; pace that &quot;it&#x27;s nearly impossible to draw a breath, much less take a moment to laugh at the revoltingly hilarious exploits.&quot; In a much less positive review, &quot;Time Out&quot; summarised that although &quot;the film had its moments,&quot; it was not a worthwhile watch.

The film holds a 73% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews with an average rating of 6.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Peter Jackson&#x27;s early low-budget shocker boasts a disgusting premise—aliens harvesting humans for fast food—that gives the budding auteur plenty of room for gross-out visuals and absurd cleverness.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews by 4 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot;

==Censorship==
The banning of an already cut version of &quot;Bad Taste&quot; in Queensland, Australia, three weeks into its run, led to the firing and dissolution of the Queensland Film Board of Review in 1990. The film had to be trimmed for release in Australia at the time, as the OFLC felt the gore too excessive. When released on home video in Australia, the words &quot;BANNED IN QUEENSLAND&quot; was proclaimed on the cover. The uncut version was released by Universal Home Entertainment on DVD in 2004.

Apart from the uncut version, there is a heavily cut FSK 18-rated and an even more censored FSK 12-rated version in Germany available on DVD. The former is cut by approximately 6 minutes, the latter by approximately 10 minutes.

==Home media==
The film was first released on DVD in 2001 by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

In December 2018, Peter Jackson announced that he plans to restore &quot;Bad Taste&quot;, along with his two following films &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; and &quot;Braindead&quot; (known as Dead Alive in North America) for a possible 4K release.

==Legacy==
During his acceptance speech at the 2004 Academy Awards, Jackson mentioned &quot;Bad Taste&quot; (along with &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;), joking that it had been &quot;wisely overlooked by the Academy.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;Bad Taste&quot; as the 416th greatest film of all time, based on opinions from readers and industry professionals.

<doc id="534752" wikidata="Q6547479" url="?curid=534752" title="Lila McCann">
<text>Lila Elaine McCann (born December 4, 1981) is an American country music singer who made her debut at age 16 with the single &quot;Down Came a Blackbird.&quot; Reaching a peak of No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts, the song was the first release from her 1997 album &quot;Lila&quot;, which became the highest-selling album for a debut country music act in 1997 and was certified platinum in the United States.

In 1998, McCann played Kelly Wyman, an aspiring country singer in the &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; episode &quot;Eyes of a Ranger&quot; on CBS.

McCann followed &quot;Lila&quot; with two more albums: 1999&#x27;s gold-certified &quot;Something in the Air&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Complete&quot;, before being dropped by her label in 2001. She signed to the independent Broken Bow Records label in 2005, releasing five singles for the label before being dropped in 2008. Overall, she has charted twelve singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, with the highest-peaking being 1998&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Fall in Love&quot; at No. 3. Her second-highest peaking single, 1999&#x27;s &quot;With You&quot;, which reached No. 9 on the country charts and No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, her only entry on the latter chart.

==Biography==
Lila Elaine McCann was born in Puyallup, Washington. She gave her first public performance at age four, when she sang &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; in her father&#x27;s country music band. Later on, she became a local performer in her own right, singing in small venues around her hometown. By the time she was in her early teens, McCann recorded &quot;Down Came a Blackbird&quot;, a song which was given to her by her manager, Kasey Walker. McCann&#x27;s version of the song was sent to Seymour Stein, president of the Asylum Records label, who signed her to a recording contract in 1997.

==Career==

===1997-1998: &quot;Lila&quot;===
&quot;Down Came a Blackbird&quot; was issued in mid-1997 as the first single from her debut album, &quot;Lila&quot;; the song went on to peak at No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Released in June 1997, &quot;Lila&quot; drew critical acclaim and comparisons to LeAnn Rimes. These comparisons stemmed from the fact that both singers, who were teenagers at the time, were recording material that was considered mature for their age. &quot;Lila&quot; was also the highest-selling album for a new country music act that year, earning platinum certification in the United States for shipments of one million copies. &quot;I Wanna Fall in Love&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, became McCann&#x27;s highest-charting single at No. 3 on the US country charts and No. 1 on the Canadian country charts. However, the third and fourth singles (a cover of Sheena Easton&#x27;s &quot;Almost Over You&quot; and the Mark Spiro-Andrew Gold collaboration &quot;Yippy Ky Yay&quot;, respectively) failed to make Top 40 in the US, although the former was a No. 38 in Canada. Later in 1998, McCann recorded a song titled &quot;To Get Me to You&quot; for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Hope Floats&quot;. This song was released to radio, although it did not chart.

===1999-2000: &quot;Something in the Air&quot; and &quot;Complete&quot;===
McCann&#x27;s second album, &quot;Something in the Air&quot;, was issued in 1999. Originally slated as its lead-off single was &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, which featured harmony vocals from Vince Gill, Steve Wariner and Bryan White (of whom the latter two also co-wrote the song). This song was withdrawn before it could chart, however, and &quot;With You&quot; was its replacement. This song entered Top Ten on the country music charts, and peaked at No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving McCann her only entry on the latter chart. &quot;Something in the Air&quot; was certified gold in the United States; although three additional singles were released from it, none reached higher than No. 41 on the country music charts.

McCann&#x27;s third album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Complete&quot;, was issued on Warner Bros. Records, due to the closure of Asylum Records&#x27;s Nashville division which resulted in the transfer of Asylum&#x27;s roster to the Warner Bros. label. Nineteen years old at the time of its release, McCann felt that the album marked an increased level of maturity in her work. The first single from &quot;Complete&quot;, &quot;Come a Little Closer&quot;, reached a peak of No. 43 on the country music charts. After it came &quot;Because of You&quot;, which failed to chart. McCann was dropped from Warner Bros.&#x27; roster in 2002, following the release of a &quot;Super Hits&quot; compilation which was composed of material from her previous albums.

===2005-2008: Switch to Broken Bow===
On November 20, 2005, McCann married her boyfriend Mike Wolofsky in Nashville. Later that same year McCann signed to a new recording contract with Broken Bow Records, an independent record label. Although four singles were issued on the label between 2005 and early 2006, no album was released on Broken Bow during that timespan. A fifth single for Broken Bow, titled &quot;That&#x27;s What Angels Do&quot;, was shipped to radio in December 2007, and entered the country music charts at No. 60. McCann left Broken Bow Records in early 2008 and announced in October of the same year that she was expecting her and her husband&#x27;s first child, Abraham Elliot (born December 15, 2008). In 2011, Lila and Mike had their second son Benjamin (born December 6, 2011), while she worked as a successful photographer, operating a photography business in the Nashville area.

===2016-present: &quot;Paint This Town&quot;===
At the end of 2016, she started working on a new album through a PledgeMusic campaign. She released the new album &quot;Paint This Town&quot; on March 3, 2017, through the campaign as a download and physical copy for those who ordered it through the campaign. Then on August 18, 2017 she released it through iTunes.

On June 17, 2019, McCann posted on her official Instagram and Facebook pages that she has happily remarried a woman and is openly gay.

<text>Adjutant is a military appointment given to an officer who assists the commanding officer with unit administration, mostly the management of “human resources” in an army unit. The term is used in French-speaking armed forces as a non-commissioned officer rank similar to a master sergeant or warrant officer but is not equivalent to the role or appointment of an adjutant.

An adjutant general is commander of an army&#x27;s administrative services.

==Etymology==
Adjutant comes from the Latin &quot;adiutāns&quot;, present participle of the verb &quot;adiūtāre&quot;, frequentative form of &quot;adiuvāre&quot; &#x27;to help&#x27;; the Romans actually used &quot;adiūtor&quot; for the noun.

==Military appointment==
In various uniformed hierarchies, the term is used for a number of functions, but generally as a principal aide to a commanding officer.

A regimental adjutant, garrison adjutant etc. is a staff officer who assists the commanding officer of a regiment, battalion or garrison in the details of regimental, garrison or similar duty. In United States Army squadrons, the adjutant is often the officer-in-charge (OIC) of the administrative platoon.

===UK and other Commonwealth countries===
In the British Army, an adjutant (&quot;adj&quot;; sometimes actually referred to as this) is usually a senior captain, and sometimes a major. As the colonel&#x27;s personal staff officer, he was once in charge of all the organisation, administration and discipline for a battalion or regiment, although now the bulk of administrative work is carried out by the regimental administrative officer (RAO). Until the 1970s the adjutant was also the regimental operations officer, although this job is now filled by a separate officer. In the British Army, adjutants are given field rank and as such are senior by appointment to all other captains, ranking just behind the majors. Unlike the RAO (who is an officer of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps), the adjutant is a member of the corps or regiment of which their unit is a part.

The adjutant&#x27;s job is not solely a &#x27;backroom&#x27; one, since he usually accompanies the colonel—Captain David Wood, the adjutant of 2 Para, was killed in action at the Battle of Goose Green, for example. Normally, in a British Infantry battalion, the adjutant controls the battle whilst the CO commands it. As such, the adjutant is usually a person of significant influence within their battalion. In the Foot Guards, the adjutant of the unit in charge of Trooping the Colour is one of three officers on horseback.

In many Commonwealth armies, the adjutant performs much the same role as in the British Army. There is no RAO position within the Australian or Canadian armies, where an adjutant performs the administrative role with the assistance of a Chief Clerk, who usually has a rank of Warrant Officer Class Two.

===Canada===
In the Canadian Armed Forces, the term adjutant is used in common with other English-speaking armies, and the corresponding French term is &quot;Capitaine-adjudant&quot;.

===Bangladesh===
The Bangladesh Army has the appointment of adjutant which is similar to that in old British system. Though the authorization is of captain rank, often a lieutenant can be appointed as adjutant, although a Lieutenant posted as adjutant will not receive the staff pay as a captain with same appointment. Resaldar Adjutant (RA), or Warrant Officer Adjutant (WOA), is a position unique to the Bangladesh Army. He is a warrant officer who acts as deputy to the adjutant. In spite of this, the WOA or RA does not have any authority in official correspondences. His main role is the transmission and the execution of the adjutant&#x27;s orders in all companies. On all formal parades, the standard procedure is for the Squadron/Company Sergeant Major to first report to the RA/WOA, and the RA/WOA in turn to report to the Adjutant.

===India===
The Indian Army has the position of adjutant, which is based on the old British system. The adjutants in most cases are captains but in some cases hold the rank of major (especially in Regimental Centres). Subedar Adjutant (SA) is a position unique to the Bangladesh Army and Indian Army. He is a subedar who acts as deputy to the adjutant. On all formal parades, the standard procedure is for the company havildar major to first report to the subedar adjutant, and the subedar adjutant in turn to report to the adjutant. In the British Indian Army, the equivalent position was the jemadar adjutant, who held the lower rank of jemadar.

===Pakistan===
The Pakistan Army has the appointment of Adjutant which is similar to that in old British system. Adjutants in the Pak Army are mostly captains and sometimes lieutenants. The Pak Army also holds the rank of junior adjutant (JA) who works as an aide to the adjutant and is of the rank of subedar, an equivalent rank to warrant officer or sergeant in Western armies.

The Regimental Adjutant is also Commander of Regimental Provost and Assist Commanding Officer in all matters pertaining to discipline, training and operational planning.

===United States===
In the US Army, historically the adjutant was generally a member of the branch or regiment of the parent unit (e.g. in an infantry battalion, the adjutant was usually an infantry officer). In 2008, as a result of the Army&#x27;s transformation, the Human Resources community implemented the Personnel Services Delivery Redesign, which recoded the adjutant position in battalions to an officer from the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps. The adjutant general at the battalion-level is generally a junior captain or senior first lieutenant and, in conjunction with the S-1 section, manages the administrative functions of the unit. The adjutant also works closely with the unit&#x27;s command sergeant major for awards ceremonies, traditional ceremonial functions, casual events (hails and farewells), evaluation reports, and management of correspondence and other secretarial functions. Based upon the needs of the commander, an adjutant typically from the combat arms branches may still be specially appointed in modern-day to assist a brigade commander to ease his/her burden of command.

There is a bugle call announcing the adjutant that is still used in military ceremonies today.

In the United States Marine Corps, the adjutant serves as the senior administrator for their unit, and is the OIC (officer in charge) of the S-1 or admin shop.

The USMC MOS handbook says:

Adjutants coordinate administrative matters for Marine Corps staff sections and external agencies at the staff level. They ensure that every Marine in their command has administrative resources both for day-to-day tasks and long-term career progression. Adjutants supervise the execution of administrative policies. They receive and route correspondence, preparing responses to any special correspondence. They also manage their unit&#x27;s legal matters and monitor fitness reports, among other administrative duties.

==Military rank==
===France===
In the French Army, Air Force and Gendarmerie, the ranks of ( in the navy) and ( in the navy) may be considered equivalent to Commonwealth warrant officer ranks. These ranks are senior to the rank of and junior to the rank of . Like the officers, the are entitled to the &quot;mon&quot; before their rank, as in &quot;&quot;.

In France, each corps has a colour (gold for most infantry units, artillery, the air force and engineers, or silver for most cavalry units, transport and materiel corps). A French adjutant wears a band, with thin red line, in the opposite colour to that of his corps. A chief adjutant wears a band, with thin red line, in the colour of his corps. In order to distinguish an &quot;adjutant&quot; from a &quot;chief adjutant&quot; it is necessary to know the arm&#x27;s colour.

In cavalry units, &quot;adjudants&quot; and &quot;adjudants-chefs&quot; are addressed by tradition as &quot;lieutenants&quot;.

===Netherlands===

Within the Netherlands Armed Forces the seniormost non-commissioned officer rank across all branches is called . The rank is both rated OR-8 and OR-9 within the NATO rank structure, however, it is only after 3 years as an that there is advancement to OR-9.

==Adjutant general==
An adjutant general is both a rank and a role that may represent the principal staff officer of an army; through the adjutant general, the commanding general receives communications and issues military orders.

In the United States, the adjutant general is the chief military officer of the United States National Guard units in any one of the American states. This use of the term reflects the early history of the United States, because of which each of the 50 states has partial sovereignty, including the right to maintain military forces; the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are state units that can be called to federal duty in case of national emergency.

<doc id="534760" wikidata="Q5209312" url="?curid=534760" title="The Daily Nebraskan">
<text>The Daily Nebraskan, established in 1871 as the Monthly Hesperian Student, is the student newspaper of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Although many journalism students are on staff, the &quot;Daily Nebraskan&quot; is independent of the university&#x27;s College of Journalism and Mass Communications. The newspaper is entirely student-produced and managed, and has a professional general manager, Allen Vaughan, who joined in July 2019 after the retirement of Dan Shattil, who retired in October 2019 after 37 years at the helm.

The website publishes every school day during the fall and spring semesters, with the exceptions of the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break and the last four days of finals week. It publishes weekly during summer sessions. The Daily Nebraskan covers campus and Lincoln news, along with arts, entertainment, and sports. There is also an opinion page featuring student columnists. In addition, other articles published include the 1948 Nebraska parking riots, the campus strike of 1970, and articles that were written by Warren Buffett&#x27;s parents.

==History==
The &quot;Daily Nebraskan&quot; was first published as a monthly and a weekly edition before becoming a daily paper. Its official birthday is June 13, 1901. As the newspaper&#x27;s style and content changed, so did its identity and moniker. From 1871 to 1885, the paper was published by the Palladian Literary Society and known as the &quot;Monthly Hesperian Student&quot;. The first editor of the &quot;Hesperian&quot; was W.L. Sweet and the paper contained only six sections.

In 1885 the name was shortened to &quot;The Hesperian.&quot; At that time the University of Nebraska–Lincoln had multiple student publications; one of these, &quot;The Nebraskan&quot;, also known as &quot;The Rag&quot; after its editor, was founded in 1892 by Frank T. Riley. For seven years UNL would have two weekly newspapers until &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot; was organized on January 13, 1901 as a consolidation of &quot;The Hesperian&quot; and &quot;The Nebraskan.&quot; The evolved newspaper flourished beyond rival publications.

While the editorship of the paper was first elected by the student body as an official publication, the paper is now financially supported through advertising and student fees. Of its leaders, the most well-known is notable Nebraskan author Willa Cather. In 1892, Cather became the literary editor of &quot;The Hesperian;&quot; in November 1893 she was named the managing editor. Cather would hold this position until she graduated from the university in 1895.

In the mid-2000s, the daily paper converted to publishing tri-weekly, on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Later, it switched to a twice a week schedule. Beginning in the fall of 2017, the DN was to complete its transition to a digital-first publication at its dailynebraskan.com web address, and print a monthly newsmagazine.

==Satire==
Throughout its publication, the &quot;Daily Nebraskan&quot; has always included pieces of satire. For most of its history the paper collected articles with a satirical tone over the course of the year and assembled them together for the April 1st publication. Iterations of this special daily edition were sometimes jokingly referred to as the &quot;Daily Halfaskan&quot;. Like the front page included on the left, the satirical papers published on April Fools were humorous and lampooned facets of university life in Nebraska.

Students of satire at UNL found this single issue of satire too limiting a venue and decided to launch an additional student paper. In 2008, &quot;The DailyER&quot; was launched as a bi-weekly publication dedicated to satirical and radical news.

<doc id="534767" wikidata="Q16169805" url="?curid=534767" title="Travesties">
<text>Travesties is a 1974 play by Tom Stoppard. It centres on the figure of Henry Carr, an old man who reminisces about Zürich in 1917 during the First World War, and his interactions with James Joyce when he was writing &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Tristan Tzara during the rise of Dada, and Lenin leading up to the Russian Revolution, all of whom were living in Zürich at that time.

==Background==
The real Henry Carr was a minor consular official who played Algernon in a production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; in Zürich in 1917 in a group of actors called The English Players, for whom the real James Joyce was the business manager. Carr and Joyce had an angry disagreement after the production, which led to legal action and accusations of slander by Joyce. The dispute was settled with the judge deciding in favour of both disputants on different counts. Joyce later had his revenge by parodying Carr and the English Consul General in Zürich at that time, A. Percy Bennett, as two minor characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, with Carr being portrayed as a drunken, obscene soldier in the &quot;Circe&quot; episode.

In the 1970s, Tom Stoppard, struck by the fact that Joyce, Vladimir Lenin and the Dadaist poet Tristan Tzara were all in Zurich in 1917, wrote a play that brought all three together seen through the unreliable memory of the octogenarian Carr looking back five decades later. In &quot;Travesties&quot; Carr is the central figure with the others in orbit around him. He is seen both as an old man reminiscing and as the young man of 1917 – the same actor plays both Carrs. 

After the first performance of &quot;Travesties&quot;, Stoppard received a letter from Henry Carr&#x27;s widow expressing her surprise that her late husband had been included as a character in Stoppard&#x27;s play.

==Plot==
The play is set in Zürich, Switzerland during the First World War and in the 1970s. In 1917, three historicallly important figures were living in Zürich: the modernist author James Joyce, the communist revolutionary Lenin, and the Dada founder Tristan Tzara. The play centres on the less notable Henry Carr, a British consular official, as he recalls his encounters with these three. As he reminisces, Carr&#x27;s memory becomes prone to distraction, and the narrative veers away from historical accuracy.

The young Carr spies on Lenin, argues with Tzara about the nature of true art, is persuaded by Joyce to play Algernon and later quarrels over the cost of buying new trousers for the role. The old Carr concludes the first act:

After further confused memories and mix-ups in the second act, the old Carr concludes the play:
==Production history==

===Original production===
&quot;Travesties&quot; was first produced at the Aldwych Theatre, London, on 10 June 1974, by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production was directed by Peter Wood and designed by Carl Toms. It closed on 13 March 1976 after 156 performances at the Aldwych and the Albery Theatres in London, and the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York.

* Nadya: Frances Cuka

===1993 production===
A revival of the play, directed by Adrian Noble and featuring a revised text that abbreviated Cecily&#x27;s lecture on Lenin in Act II by moving much of it to the interval, was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at its theatre in the Barbican Arts Centre in September 1993. The production transferred to the Savoy Theatre in March 1994.

===2016–2017 production===
A new revival, directed by Patrick Marber, was performed at the Menier Chocolate Factory from September until November 2016. The production &quot;broke box office records at the Menier Chocolate Factory, becoming the first play in the company’s history to sell out ahead of its first preview&quot;. In February 2017 the play, and company, transferred to the Apollo Theatre in London, where the run continued until April 2017.

* Henry Carr – Tom Hollander
* Gwendolen Carr – Amy Morgan
* Tristan Tzara – Freddie Fox
* Cecily Carruthers – Clare Foster

* James Joyce – Peter McDonald
* Nadya – Sarah Quist
* Bennett – Tim Wallers

The production&#x27;s designer was Tim Hatley, the lighting designer Neil Austin, and Adam Cork was the sound designer and composer of original music.

===2018 production===
Patrick Marber&#x27;s revival transferred to Broadway in spring 2018, with Tom Hollander reprising his role as Henry Carr and Peter McDonald reprising his performance as James Joyce. Travesties opened on 24 April 2018 at the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s American Airlines Theater in New York.

* Henry Carr – Tom Hollander
* James Joyce – Peter McDonald 
* Tristan Tzara – Seth Numrich
* Lenin – Dan Butler

The Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s education team have produced an &#x27;Upstage&#x27; guide to &quot;Travesties&quot; which puts the play&#x27;s themes in historical context and contains interviews with the director, cast, and crew. The revival has been praised by critics with Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting that he &quot;...would venture that this latest incarnation is the clearest and surely one of the liveliest on record. It should prove ridiculously entertaining for anyone with even a passing knowledge of its central characters, and a stroll through the groves of Wikipedia should offer adequate preparation for anyone else.&quot;

===2019 Australian production===
The Australian premiere of the 2016 script adaptation opened in Melbourne in winter 2019, with Dion Mills taking the role of Henry Carr. The production was directed by Jennifer Sarah Dean.

<doc id="534778" wikidata="Q1089283" url="?curid=534778" title="Child's Play 3">
<text>Child&#x27;s Play 3 is a 1991 American slasher film and the third installment in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; film series. The film is written by Don Mancini and directed by Jack Bender. Brad Dourif once again reprised his role as Chucky from the previous films while new cast members include Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves and Jeremy Sylvers. It was executive-produced by David Kirschner, who produced the first two &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; films. Although released only nine months after &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot;, the story takes place eight years following the events of that film, and one month before the events of &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; (which was made seven years later). The film follows Andy Barclay (Whalin) now 16, enrolling at Kent Military School. Andy is unknowingly followed by a revived Chucky (Dourif), who sets his sight on a younger kid cadet Ronald Tyler (Sylvers).

After the success of the previous two films, Universal Studios forced Mancini to draft the screenplay for &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; in such a short amount of time. A concept featuring &quot;multiple Chuckys&quot; was considered, but was scrapped due to time and budget constraints, although it would be reworked into a later installment &quot;Cult of Chucky.&quot; Alex Vincent, who played Andy, did not reprise his role due to the film being released in 1991 despite taking place in 1998. Several actors auditioned until Justin Whalin was chosen for the role of Andy.

Released on August 30, 1991, in the United States by Universal Pictures, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $20.5 million worldwide against a budget of $13 million, being the lowest-grossing film in the series. The film became notorious in the United Kingdom when it was suggested it might have inspired the real-life murder of a British child, James Bulger, suggestions rejected by officers investigating the case.

== Plot ==
Eight years after Chucky&#x27;s second demise, the Play Pals company resumes manufacturing Good Guy dolls and re-opens their abandoned factory. As Chucky&#x27;s corpse is being removed from the building, a splash of his blood inadvertently falls into the molten plastic being used to produce the dolls, reviving him in a new body. Chucky tortures and murders Play Pals CEO Mr. Sullivan using various children&#x27;s toys, and then uses his computer records to locate Andy Barclay.

Now 16, Andy has been sent to Kent Military School after failing to cope in several foster homes. Colonel Cochrane, the school&#x27;s commandant, advises Andy to forget his &quot;fantasies&quot; about the doll. Andy befriends cadets Ronald Tyler, an 8-year-old boy; Harold Aubrey Whitehurst, a cowardly young man; and Kristin De Silva, for whom he develops romantic feelings. He also meets Brett C. Shelton, a sadistic lieutenant colonel who routinely bullies the cadets.

Tyler is asked to deliver a package to Andy&#x27;s room. Tyler realizes that the package contains a Good Guy doll and takes it to the school&#x27;s weapons armory to open it. Chucky bursts from the package and is incensed to find Tyler instead of Andy. However, remembering he can possess the first person who learns his true identity, he tells Tyler his secret. Before Chucky can enact the voodoo soul-swapping ritual to possess Tyler, Cochrane interrupts them and confiscates the doll, throwing it into a garbage truck. Chucky escapes by luring the driver into the truck&#x27;s compactor and crushing him to death.

That night, Chucky attacks Andy and tells him his plans for taking over Tyler&#x27;s body. Before Andy can fight back, Shelton comes in and takes the doll from him. Andy then sneaks into Shelton&#x27;s room to recover it; Shelton awakens to confront him, only to find that Chucky has vanished. Suspecting the doll was stolen, Shelton forces all the cadets to do exercises as punishment. Chucky attempts to possess Tyler again, but they are interrupted by De Silva and fellow cadet Ivers. Later, a knife-wielding Chucky surprises Cochrane, unintentionally shocking him into a fatal heart attack. The next morning, Andy tries to convince Tyler that Chucky is evil, but Tyler refuses to believe him. Meanwhile, Chucky kills the camp barber Sergeant Botnick by slashing his throat with a straight razor. Whitehurst witnesses Botnick&#x27;s murder and flees in terror.

Despite Cochrane&#x27;s death, the school&#x27;s annual war games are ordered to proceed as planned, with cadets divided between a &quot;Red Team&quot; and &quot;Blue Team&quot;. Andy, Whitehurst (now too frightened to talk after witnessing Chucky&#x27;s action), and Shelton are assigned to the Blue Team. Chucky secretly replaces the paint bullets of the Red team with live ammunition. When the simulation begins, Chucky lures Tyler away from his team. Finally realizing that Chucky is evil, Tyler stabs him with a pocket knife and flees to find Andy. Chucky then attacks De Silva and holds her hostage, forcing Andy to exchange Tyler for De Silva. The Blue team and Red team arrive on the scene and open fire; Shelton is killed by a bullet from the Red team while Tyler escapes in the chaos. Chucky tosses a grenade at the quarrelling cadets; Whitehurst leaps on top of the grenade, sacrificing himself to save the others.

Tyler flees to a nearby carnival where Chucky kills a security guard and captures him again. Andy and De Silva arrive soon after and take the security guard&#x27;s gun. They follow Chucky and Tyler into a horror-themed roller-coaster. Chucky wounds De Silva; she gives Andy the gun and tells him to save Tyler. Andy pursues Chucky deeper into the ride and repeatedly shoots him, saving Tyler. Chucky revives and attacks again. In the struggle, Andy manages to throw him into a massive metal fan, shredding his body apart and finally killing him. De Silva is rushed to the hospital while Andy is taken away by police for questioning.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
Universal Studios had Don Mancini begin writing the third installment for the series before &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot; was released, causing pressure on him to draft a storyline on such a tight schedule&quot;.&quot; The film was formally greenlit after the successful release of its predecessor with a release date nine months away.

Mancini initially wanted to introduce the concept of &quot;multiple Chuckys&quot; in the movie, but due to budget constraints the idea was eventually scrapped. Mancini later used this concept for the 2017 sequel &quot;Cult of Chucky&quot;. It also was intended to open with a scene of a security guard portrayed by John Ritter frightening off a group of trespassing children at the Good Guys factory by telling them scary stories about Chucky. After Mancini decided to make Andy Barclay 16 years old, he considered recasting the role with Jonathan Brandis before hiring Justin Whalin. Before Jack Bender became director, Mancini wanted to hire Peter Jackson.

Principal photography began on February 4, 1991, at the Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. Further filming took place in California at Los Angeles and the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City. The carnival scenes were filmed in Valencia, California. The puppeteers made the doll speak using computer technology to control its mouth movements to align with Dourif&#x27;s prerecorded dialogue. N. Brock Winkless IV returned to work as one of Chucky&#x27;s puppeteers, as did Van Snowden.

== Reception ==
=== Box-office ===
&quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; opened in second place at the US box office behind &quot;Dead Again&quot; with $5.7 million over the 4-day 1991 Labor Day weekend, which the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;slow numbers&quot;, however, it was the top-grossing Labor Day opening at the time, beating the record $4.6 million held by &quot;Bolero&quot; since 1984. It finished its theatrical run with $15 million in the US and Canada, and a total of $20.5 million worldwide.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 19% based on reviews from 16 critics, and an average rating is 4.20/10, making it the poorest reviewed film in the series on the site. On Metacritic it has a score of 27% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; called it &quot;perverse&quot; and criticized the film&#x27;s plot. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the Chucky doll &quot;an impressive technological achievement&quot; but said the film &quot;misses the sharpness and dark humor&quot; of the original film. &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;noisy, mindless sequel&quot; with good acting. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Chucky himself is an animatronic delight, but one suspects the film&#x27;s energies and budget have all been devoted to what is essentially a one-trick pony.&quot; Stephen Wigle of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called it &quot;fun for any fan of the slasher genre&quot;.

Series creator Don Mancini said that this was his least favorite entry in the series, adding that he ran out of ideas after the second film. He elaborated further in 2013 stating that he was not pleased with the casting, feeling Jeremy Sylvers was too old for the role of Tyler and Dakin Matthews was not the &quot;R. Lee Ermey&quot; archetype he was looking for in Colonel Cochrane. Mancini would not make another entry in the &quot;Chucky&quot; series until seven years later, with &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot;. In a 2017 interview, director Jack Bender also dismissed the film by calling it &quot;kinda silly&quot;.

In the years since its release, &quot;Child’s Play 3&quot; has received a critical re-evaluation from retrospective critics and fans. Its setting, tone, climax and Dourif’s performance has been praised and is considered by some to be one of the more superior films in the series, being compared to later entries like &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; (2004).

In October 2021, Perrey Reeves, who plays De Silva in the film, expressed interest in reprising her role as the character in the TV series &quot;Chucky.&quot;

=== Awards ===
This film was nominated at the Saturn Award as Best Horror Film and Justin Whalin was nominated as Best Performance by a Younger Actor for his performance in this film. Andrew Robinson was nominated as Best Supporting Actor at the Fangoria Chainsaw Award.

== Home media ==
&quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; was originally released on home video in North America on March 12, 1992 and on DVD on October 7, 2003. It was also released in multiple collections, including &quot;The Chucky Collection&quot; (alongside &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot; and &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot;), released on October 7, 2003; &quot;Chucky – The Killer DVD Collection&quot; (alongside &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot;, &quot;Bride&quot; and &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;), released on September 19, 2006; &quot;Chucky: The Complete Collection&quot; (alongside &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, &quot;Bride&quot;, &quot;Seed&quot; and &quot;Curse of Chucky&quot;), released on October 8, 2013; and &quot;Chucky: Complete 7-Movie Collection&quot; (alongside &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, &quot;Bride&quot;, &quot;Seed&quot;, &quot;Curse&quot; and &quot;Cult of Chucky&quot;), released on October 3, 2017.

&quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; was released on 4K Ultra HD by Scream! Factory on August 16, 2022. This release included a new 4K scan from the original camera negative, a new Dolby Atmos track and several interviews recorded in 2022 with creator Don Mancini, actress Perry Reeves, executive producer David Kirschner, executive producer Robert Latham Brown, actor Michael Chieffo, makeup artist Craig Reardon and production designer Richard Sawyer.

== The murder of James Bulger ==
A suggested link with the film was made after the murder of James Bulger. The killers, who were ten years old at the time, were said to have imitated a scene in which one of Chucky&#x27;s victims is splashed with blue paint. Psychologist Guy Cumberbatch stated, &quot;The link with a video was that the father of one of the boys – Jon Venables – had rented &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; some months earlier.&quot; However, the police officer who directed the investigation, Albert Kirby, found that the son, Jon, was not living with his father at the time and was unlikely to have seen the film. Moreover, the boy disliked horror films—a point later confirmed by psychiatric reports. Thus the police investigation, which had specifically looked for a video link, concluded there was none. However, the judge, Justice Morland, said in his comments that the murder had &quot;some striking similarities&quot; to the film and that &quot;grave crimes by young children&quot; could be caused by reasons including exposure to violent video films &quot;including possibly Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot;. Following the trial, the Association of Video Retailers in the UK recommended that its members voluntarily remove the trilogy from their shelves.

The film remained controversial in Europe, and both Sky Television in the United Kingdom and Canal+ in Spain refused to broadcast the film as regular programming and the case led to new legislation for video films.

=== Novelization ===
A tie-in novel was later written by Matthew J. Costello. Just like &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot;, this novel had some of the author&#x27;s own inclusions. In the beginning (adapted from an earlier draft of the screenplay), in the Play Pals factory, a rat scours for food and, smelling blood within the plastic, chews on Chucky&#x27;s remains. Blood then leaks out of the remains and somehow leaks onto another doll.

Chucky&#x27;s death in this book is also different. In the novel, while defending Tyler on an exterior ride, Andy grapples with Chucky before finally shooting him several times, causing the doll&#x27;s body to fall to the ground, and Andy watches the head shatter to blood, metal and plastic.

=== Sequels ===
The film was followed by &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; in 1998, &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; in 2004, &quot;Curse of Chucky&quot; in 2013, &quot;Cult of Chucky&quot; in 2017, and the TV series &quot;Chucky&quot; in 2021.

=== Halloween Horror Nights ===
In 2009, the climax of &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; received its own maze at Universal Studios″ &quot;Halloween Horror Nights&quot;, entitled &quot;Chucky&#x27;s Fun House&quot;.

This is not the first time Chucky has been featured in &quot;Halloween Horror Nights&quot;. Since 1992, Chucky has starred in his shows, &quot;Chucky&#x27;s In-Your-Face Insults&quot; and &quot;Chucky&#x27;s Insult Emporium&quot;. &quot;Curse of Chucky&quot; also received its own Scarezone in the 2013 lineup.
