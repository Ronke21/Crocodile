<text>Samuel Bronfman, (February 27, 1889 – July 10, 1971) was a Canadian businessman, philanthropist, and member of the Canadian Bronfman family. He founded Distillers Corporation Limited and purchased the Seagram Company, that became the world’s largest liquor distilling firm.

==Biography ==
Samuel Bronfman was born onboard ship (en route to Canada) either in Soroki or in Otaci, Soroca uyezd, Bessarabia, then part of the Russian Empire (present-day Moldova), one of eight children of Mindel and Yechiel Bronfman. He and his parents were Jewish refugees of Czarist Russia&#x27;s antisemitic pogroms, who immigrated to Wapella in Saskatchewan&#x27; District of Assiniboia. They soon moved to Brandon, Manitoba. A wealthy family, they were accompanied by their rabbi and two servants. Soon Yechiel learned that tobacco farming, which had made him a wealthy man in his homeland, was incompatible with the cold climate of that region. Yechiel was forced to work as a laborer for the Canadian Northern Railway, and after a short time moved to a better job in a sawmill. Yechiel and his sons then started making a good living selling firewood and began a trade in frozen whitefish to earn a winter income. Eventually, they turned to trade horses, a venture through which they became involved in the hotel and bar business.

In 1903, the family bought a hotel business, and Samuel, noting that much of the profit was in alcoholic beverages, set up shop as a liquor distributor. He founded the &quot;Distillers Corporation&quot; in Montreal in 1924, specializing in cheap whisky, and concurrently taking advantage of the U.S. prohibition on alcoholic beverages. The Bronfmans sold liquor to the northern cities of the U.S. such as Boston, New York City and Chicago during the Prohibition era, where alcohol production and distribution was illegal, while operating from the perimeters of Montreal, Quebec where alcohol production was legal.

On June 21, 1922, Bronfman married Saidye Rosner (December 9, 1896 – July 6, 1995), with whom he had four children: Aileen Mindel &quot;Minda&quot; Bronfman de Gunzburg (1925–1985),
Phyllis Lambert (born January 24, 1927), Edgar Miles Bronfman (June 20, 1929 – December 21, 2013), Charles Rosner Bronfman (born June 27, 1931).

==Business career==
Bronfman&#x27;s Distillers Corporation acquired Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons of Waterloo, Ontario, from the heirs of Joseph Seagram in 1928. Bronfman eventually built an empire based on the appeal of brand names developed previously by Seagram—including Calvert, Dewars, and Seven Crown—to higher-level consumers. His sales were boosted during the United States&#x27; abortive experiment with prohibition, and he was apparently able to do so while staying within the confines of both Canadian law, where prohibition laws had been previously repealed, and American law. His renamed company, Seagram Co. Ltd., became an international distributor of alcoholic beverages, and a diversified conglomerate which included an entertainment branch. Under his leadership, in the 1950s the Seagram company developed a headquarters in New York City, the Seagram Building.

Because of changes to US tax law in the Lyndon Johnson administration, it became advantageous for Bronfman to purchase an oil company, which he did with the purchase of Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company in 1963 for $50 million. In 1980, the Bronfman heirs sold the Texas Pacific Oil holdings to Sun Oil Co. for $2.3 billion.

The Seagram assets have since been acquired by other companies, notably The Coca-Cola Company, Diageo, and Pernod Ricard.

==Philanthropy, awards and commemoration==
In 1952, he established The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation, one of Canada&#x27;s major private granting foundations. Bronfman was President of the Canadian Jewish Congress from 1939 to 1962, and he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1967. In 1971, he helped to establish the Bronfman Building at McGill University, which houses the Desautels Faculty of Management. The building was named in his honour as appreciation for his donation to the university. The Bronfman family has continued its support of the university; in 1993 they created the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, and in 2002 donated the Seagram Building on Sherbrooke St. to McGill.

The Bronfman Archaeology Wing of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel, is named for Bronfman and his wife.

The Samuel Bronfman Chair in Management was also established at McGill University in January 1942. The current holder is Nancy J. Adler, a professor of organizational behavior in the Desautels Faculty of Management.

From 1961 to 1970, the Samuel Bronfman Foundation funded the American Public Health Association&#x27;s Bronfman Prize for Public Health Achievement and Annual Bronfman Lecture to support public health practitioners that were neglected by existing awards focused on biomedical discoveries. The first awardees were World Health Organization Director-General Marcolino Gomes Candau, National Tuberculosis Association Director James E. Perkins, and National Heart Institute Director James Watt. The first Bronfman lecture was delivered by John C. Bugher, director of the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras&#x27; Nuclear Center, on his work supporting the US Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s biomedical research.

==In fiction==
Mordecai Richler&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Solomon Gursky Was Here&quot; is largely based on the life of Samuel Bronfman.

<text>A Woman of Paris is a feature-length American silent film starring Edna Purviance that debuted in 1923. A United Artists production, the film was an atypical drama film for its creator; written, directed, produced and later scored by Charlie Chaplin. It is also known as A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate.

&quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; was Chaplin&#x27;s first feature-length film and his main effort at &quot;straight dramatic subject matter&quot; and his only film in which he does not appear as an actor; his next film was the highly acclaimed comedy &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; (1925). Years later he made &quot;Limelight&quot; which has been both described as &quot;comedy-drama&quot; and a &quot;drama&quot;.

==Plot==
Marie St. Clair and her fiancé, aspiring artist Jean Millet, plan to leave their small French village for Paris, where they will marry. On the night before their scheduled departure, Marie leaves her house for a rendezvous with Jean. Marie&#x27;s stepfather locks her out of the house, telling her to find shelter elsewhere.

Jean invites Marie to his parents&#x27; home, but his father also refuses to let her stay. Jean escorts Marie to the train station, and promises to return after going home to pack. When he arrives at home, he discovers his father has died. When Marie telephones Jean from the station he tells her they must postpone their trip, but she leaves on the train without him.

A year later in Paris, Marie is enjoying a life of luxury as the mistress of wealthy businessman and philanderer Pierre Revel. A friend calls and invites Marie to a raucous party in the Latin Quarter. She gives Marie the address but cannot remember whether the apartment is in the building on the right or the left. Marie enters the wrong building and is surprised to be greeted by Jean, who shares a modest apartment with his mother. Marie tells Jean she would like for him to paint her portrait and gives him a card with her address.

Jean calls on Marie at her apartment to begin the painting. Marie notices he is wearing a black armband and asks why he is in mourning. Jean tells Marie his father died the night she left without him.

Marie and Jean revive their romance, and Marie distances herself from Pierre Revel. Jean finishes Marie&#x27;s portrait, but instead of painting her wearing the elegant outfit she chose for the sitting, he paints her in the simple dress she wore on the night she left for Paris.

Jean proposes to Marie. Jean&#x27;s mother fights with him over the proposal. Marie arrives unexpectedly outside Jean&#x27;s apartment just in time to overhear Jean pacify his mother, telling her that he proposed in a moment of weakness. Jean fails to convince Marie he did not mean what she overheard, and she returns to Pierre Revel.

The following night, Jean slips a gun into his coat pocket and goes to the exclusive restaurant where Marie and Pierre are dining. Jean and Pierre get into a scuffle, and Jean is ejected from the dining room. Jean fatally shoots himself in the foyer of the restaurant.

The police carry Jean&#x27;s body to his apartment. Jean&#x27;s mother retrieves the gun and goes to Marie&#x27;s apartment, but Marie has gone to Jean&#x27;s studio. Jean&#x27;s mother returns and finds Marie sobbing by Jean&#x27;s body. The two women reconcile and return to the French countryside, where they open a home for orphans in a country cottage.

One morning, Marie and one of the girls in her care walk down the lane to get a pail of milk. Marie and the girl meet a group of sharecroppers who offer them a ride back in their horse-drawn wagon. At the same time, Pierre Revel and another gentleman are riding through the French countryside in a chauffeur-driven automobile. Pierre&#x27;s companion asks him what had happened to Marie St. Clair. Pierre replies that he does not know. The automobile and the horse-drawn wagon pass each other, heading in opposite directions.

==Cast==
==Production==

Two things distinguish this film from Chaplin&#x27;s other work. The most obvious is that he does not appear in the film, at least not in his traditional role of the Tramp. He has a brief cameo as a porter in a train station. This role is inconspicuous and not credited. The other major difference between this and most of Chaplin&#x27;s other work is that the film is a serious drama. Indeed, &quot;only once did Chaplin depart from his usual form of expression in 1923 with the single dramatic venture, &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;.

Edna Purviance plays the lead as Marie St. Clair. One of Chaplin&#x27;s reasons for producing the film was to help Purviance gain recognition as an actress without Chaplin at her side. Others were because he wanted to stay behind the camera and to make his first real drama. Despite his effort, Purviance did not achieve the level of success that she had in films with Chaplin&#x27;s Tramp at her side. However, the film did help Adolphe Menjou gain some recognition.

Chaplin and music associate Eric James created a score for a theatrical reissue. Chaplin elected to trim the film (approximately 8 minutes of footage was removed) for the reissue version to further tighten the action. The Museum of Modern Art held the world premiere of &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; with Chaplin&#x27;s new music soundtrack on December 23, 1976. The reissue version was given a theatrical release in 1977.

==Reception==
===Contemporary response===
&quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; is the first feature Chaplin made with the company he co-founded, United Artists. Upon release &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; was not well received by his fans. Chaplin was very popular at the time, and many went to the film expecting to see Chaplin in his traditional comedic role. An attempt was made to ease the public into the idea of Chaplin making a movie without starring in it. At the premiere Chaplin had flyers distributed informing those in line that &quot;A Woman in Paris&quot; diverged from his normal work, and that he hoped the public would find it enjoyable.

Critical response to the film, on the other hand, was very positive and &quot;generally praised as an outstanding film&quot; The film has been credited with influencing later filmmakers. In particular, the motivations and personalities of its characters had a complexity that was unconventional in the context of early 1920s American cinema.

United Artists producer and screen star Mary Pickford declared it a favorite:

&quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;, like other films at that time, was subject to censorship by state and local boards. For example, the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors found the film acceptable only with revisions, and, even though Massachusetts passed the film, the local board of Worcester banned the film as being &quot;morally objectionable.&quot;

===Later assessments===
Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance champions &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; and writes at length in &quot;Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema&quot; of the film&#x27;s importance. Vance notes:

Historian Lewis Jacobs reminds viewers that the full title of the film is &quot;A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate&quot;. As such, &quot;the treatment of the story eliminated the moral tone that such a story would be expected to have. Chaplin called it a &#x27;drama of fate&#x27;: in it he tried to show the influence of circumstances upon people.&quot; Critic James R. Quirk in &quot;Photoplay&quot; (September 1923), noted that Chaplin achieves this through &quot;an unrelenting realism that makes each incident seem inevitable.&quot;
The movie has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews .

Chaplin comments upon the institution of marriage, questioning the mainstream view that it was a social blessing. When Marie tells her lover that she hopes for domestic security so as to raise a family, Pierre points out the window to the city street and a sordid tableau: an impoverished family trods past, the mother slapping a child, the father carrying a heavy burden and more children trailing behind the parents.

==Influence==
The film has been credited with influencing later filmmakers. In particular, the motivations and personalities of its characters had a complexity that was unconventional in the context of early 1920s American cinema.

Historian Lewis Jacobs observes that &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; inspired director Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; (1924), which, in turn influenced &quot;dozens of other films.&quot; In &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;, and other films of this genre, &quot;the harlot and the adventuress were no longer hussies but women to esteem and emulate.&quot;

<text>126 (one hundred [and] twenty-six) is the natural number following 125 and preceding 127.

==In mathematics==
As the binomial coefficient formula_1, 126 is a central binomial coefficient, and in Pascal&#x27;s Triangle, it is a pentatope number. 126 is a sum of two cubes, and since 125 + 1 is σ3(5), 126 is the fifth value of the sum of cubed divisors function.

126 is the fifth formula_2-perfect Granville number, and the third such not to be a perfect number. Also, it is known to be the smallest Granville number with three distinct prime factors, and perhaps the only such Granville number.

126 is a pentagonal pyramidal number and a decagonal number. 126 is also the different number of ways to partition a decagon into even polygons by diagonals, and the number of crossing points among the diagonals of a regular nonagon.

There are exactly 126 binary strings of length seven that are not repetitions of a shorter string, and 126 different semigroups on four elements (up to isomorphism and reversal). 

There are exactly 126 positive integers that are not solutions of the equation
:formula_3
where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; must themselves all be positive integers.

126 is the number of root vectors of simple Lie group E7.

==In physics==
126 is the seventh magic number in nuclear physics. For each of these numbers, 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126, an atomic nucleus with this many protons is or is predicted to be more stable than for other numbers. Thus, although there has been no experimental discovery of element 126, tentatively called unbihexium, it is predicted to belong to an island of stability that might allow it to exist with a long enough half life that its existence could be detected.

<text>The Yeollin Uri Party (), generally abbreviated to Uri Party (), was the ruling social-liberal political party in South Korea from 2003 to 2007. A liberal party, it was created to support then-President Roh Moo-hyun. Chung Sye Kyun was the last leader of the party and twice served as its chairman. In 2007 the party merged the United New Democratic Party to form the Democratic Party. The current-day descendant of the party is the Democratic Party of Korea, but progressives in the party have become members of the Justice Party.

==Brief history==

The party was formed when the conservative-dominated National Assembly voted to impeach then President Roh Moo-hyun, loyalists and pro-Roh faction in the Millennium Democratic Party chose to break ranks from other party members who showed lukewarm support for the administration. Some 42 out of 103 lawmakers of the Millennium Democratic Party joined the new party, and 5 lawmakers from the conservative Grand National Party also joined, seeking to complete political reforms.

The Uri Party won a sweeping victory in the 2004 Parliamentary election, winning 152 of 299 seats. It was the first time that a liberal party had won a majority in 41 years.

==Party platform and policy direction==
Policywise, the Uri Party emphasized increased spending on social services for the low-income population while de-emphasizing economic growth. It was conciliatory towards North Korea while moving away from the traditional military alliance with the U.S. and Japan. Even after North Korea had continued testing explosive devices, Uri Party members have for continued aid to North Korea, leading to heavy criticism from conservative parties and accusations of harboring Communist sympathizers. The Uri Party placed most of the blame for the crisis on the hard-line policies of the United States toward North Korea.

In addition, the party was the most culturally liberal party among the historical liberal parties in South Korea. The Uri Party insisted on expanding women&#x27;s rights and abolishing the National Security Act. The party tried very hard to clear up the legacy of far-right military dictatorship and Japanese colonization, which is considered a tragedy in South Korean history. The bill, led by the party and Roh Moo-hyun, is Special law to redeem pro-Japanese collaborators&#x27; property. Uri Party was also liberal in the issue of disabled rights. In 2006, the &#x27;Disability Discrimination Act&#x27; () was enacted under the leadership of the Uri Party. The law was opposed by conservative conglomerates.

The Hankyoreh editorial evaluated that the Uri Party was close to American liberalism.

Roh Moo-hyun was like his predecessor Kim Dae-jung a supporter of the Third Way.

==Significant events==
The party came to international attention when their members physically blocked the speaker&#x27;s chair in the National Assembly in a failed attempt to prevent the impeachment vote on President Roh on March 12, 2004. (The vote was subsequently overruled by South Korea&#x27;s Constitutional Court on May 14, 2004.) The impeachment was influenced to the Assembly elections, which the party won a majority.

On August 19, 2004, the party suffered an embarrassing setback when party chairman Shin Ki-nam resigned following revelations by a national investigation that his father had worked for the Japanese military police during the Japanese occupation. The investigation, initiated on the 56th anniversary of Liberation Day (August 15, 2004) by President Roh, was a part of a national campaign to shed light on the activity of collaborators during the Japanese occupation. The campaign was vocally supported by Shin and backed by the Uri Party.

The party&#x27;s popularity has decreased considerably after the 2004 election because of internal strife and scandals related to the President, who had admitted to feeling &quot;incompetent&quot; and unfit for the job. The Uri party failed to secure a single seat out of six electoral districts in the by-election held on April 30, 2005, losing its majority status in the National Assembly. Despite they lost the majority status, they relied on support from the centrist Democratic Party and left-wing Democratic Labor Party, which the liberals maintained majority in the National Assembly.

Prior to the Uri Party&#x27;s devastating defeat in regional elections held on May 31, 2006, Chung apologized for the party&#x27;s &quot;self-righteous attitude and inadequacy&quot;. The party failed to win in all but one area, while the opposition Grand National Party took 12 of the 16 key regional posts in the election. The Uri Party even lost in Daejeon, a city long considered a secure ruling-party stronghold.

==Merger with the Grand Unified Democratic New Party==
On August 18, 2007, the delegates of the Uri Party decided to merge into the newly created liberal party Grand Unified Democratic New Party.

<text>Sir William Arthur Stanier (27 May 1876 – 27 September 1965) was an English railway engineer, and was chief mechanical engineer of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

== Biography ==
Sir William Stanier was born in Swindon, where his father worked for the Great Western Railway (GWR) as William Dean&#x27;s Chief Clerk, and educated at Swindon High School and also, for a single year, at Wycliffe College.

In 1891 he followed his father into a career with the GWR, initially as an office boy and then for five years as an apprentice in the workshops. Between 1897 and 1900 he worked in the Drawing Office as a draughtsman, before becoming Inspector of Materials in 1900. In 1904, George Jackson Churchward appointed him as Assistant to the Divisional Locomotive Superintendent in London. In 1912 he returned to Swindon to become the Assistant Works Manager and in 1920 was promoted to the post of Works Manager.

In late 1931, he was &quot;headhunted&quot; by Sir Josiah Stamp, chairman of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), to become the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of that railway from 1 January 1932. He was charged with introducing modern and more powerful locomotive designs, using his knowledge gained with the GWR at Swindon. Stanier built many successful designs for the LMS, particularly the &quot;Black 5&quot; mixed traffic 4-6-0 and the 8F 2-8-0 freight locomotive. His Princess Coronation Class 4-6-2 No.6220 &quot;Coronation&quot; set a new British record of 114 mph, beating the previous record set by a Gresley A4.

During WWII, Stanier worked as a consultant for the Ministry of Supply, and retired in 1944. He was knighted on 9 February 1943 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on his retirement, only the third locomotive engineer after Edward Bury and Robert Stephenson to receive that honour. He was also president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 1944, and was a vice president of the Stephenson Locomotive Society for a number of years until his death in 1965.

He died in Rickmansworth in 1965. In 1906, he had married Ella Elizabeth, daughter of Levi L Morse. They had a son and a daughter.

==Locomotive Designs==

William Stanier, with the backing of Sir Josiah Stamp, chairman of the company, reversed the small engine policy, which the LMS had inherited from the Midland Railway, with beneficial results.

Locomotive designs introduced by Stanier include:
* LMS Class 2P 0-4-4T (designed in the Midland Railway design office)
* LMS Class 3MT 2-6-2T
* LMS Class 4MT 2-6-4T (3-cyl)
* LMS Class 4MT 2-6-4T (2-cyl)
* LMS Class 5MT 2-6-0
* LMS Class 5MT &quot;Black Five&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Class 6P &quot;Jubilee&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Rebuilt Royal Scot Class
* LMS Class 8P &quot;Princess Royal&quot; 4-6-2
* LMS Class 8P &quot;Princess Coronation&quot; 4-6-2 Pacific
* LMS Class 8F 2-8-0
* LMS Turbomotive

==Legacy==
Stanier&#x27;s designs were a strong influence on the later British Railways standard classes of steam locomotives designed by R A Riddles, who adopted LMS design principles in preference to those of the other &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies.

There is a secondary school in Crewe called Sir William Stanier School.

<doc id="546678" wikidata="Q7553986" url="?curid=546678" title="Soft heap">
<text>In computer science, a soft heap is a variant on the simple heap data structure that has constant amortized time complexity for 5 types of operations. This is achieved by carefully &quot;corrupting&quot; (increasing) the keys of at most a constant number of values in the heap.

==Definition and performance==
The constant time operations are:
* create(&quot;S&quot;): Create a new soft heap
* insert(&quot;S&quot;, &quot;x&quot;): Insert an element into a soft heap
* meld(&quot;S&quot;, &quot; S&#x27; &quot;): Combine the contents of two soft heaps into one, destroying both
* delete(&quot;S&quot;, &quot;x&quot;): Delete an element from a soft heap
* findmin(&quot;S&quot;): Get the element with minimum key in the soft heap

Other heaps such as Fibonacci heaps achieve most of these bounds without any corruption, but cannot provide a constant-time bound on the critical &quot;delete&quot; operation. The amount of corruption can be controlled by the choice of a parameter formula_1, but the lower this is set, the more time insertions require: expressed using Big-O notation, the amortized time will be formula_2 for an error rate of formula_1. Some versions of soft heaps allow the &quot;create&quot;, &quot;insert&quot;, and &quot;meld&quot; operations to take constant time in the worst case, producing amortized rather than worst-case performance only for findmin and delete. As with comparison sort, these algorithms access the keys only by comparisons; if arithmetic operations on integer keys are allowed, the time dependence on formula_1 can be reduced to formula_5 or (with randomization) formula_6.

More precisely, the error guarantee offered by the soft heap is the following: each soft heap is initialized with a parameter formula_1, chosen between 0 and 1/2. Then at any point in time it will contain at most formula_8 corrupted keys, where formula_9 is the number of elements inserted so far. Note that this does not guarantee that only a fixed percentage of the keys &quot;currently&quot; in the heap are corrupted: in an unlucky sequence of insertions and deletions, it can happen that all elements in the heap will have corrupted keys. Similarly, there is no guarantee that in a sequence of elements extracted from the heap with &quot;findmin&quot; and &quot;delete&quot;, only a fixed percentage will have corrupted keys: in an unlucky scenario only corrupted elements are extracted from the heap. When a key is corrupted, the value stored for it in the soft key is higher than its initially-given value; corruption can never decrease the value of any key. The &quot;findmin&quot; operation finds the minimum value among the currently stored keys, including the corrupted ones.

The soft heap was designed by Bernard Chazelle in 2000. The term &quot;corruption&quot; in the structure is the result of what Chazelle called &quot;carpooling&quot; in a soft heap. Each node in the soft heap contains a linked list of keys and one common key. The common key is an upper bound on the values of the keys in the linked list. Once a key is added to the linked list, it is considered corrupted because its value is never again relevant in any of the soft heap operations: only the common keys are compared. This is what makes soft heaps &quot;soft&quot;; one cannot be sure whether any particular value put into it will be corrupted. The purpose of these corruptions is effectively to lower the information entropy of the data, enabling the data structure to break through information-theoretic barriers regarding heaps.

== Applications ==
Despite their limitations and unpredictable nature, soft heaps are useful in the design of deterministic algorithms. For instance, they have been used to achieve the best complexity to date for finding a minimum spanning tree. Other problems whose efficient solution has been simplified using soft heaps include finding the formula_10th smallest element in several classes of structured sets of values, including heap-ordered trees, sorted matrices, and sumsets.

Another simple example is a selection algorithm, to find the formula_10th smallest of a group of formula_9 numbers:
*Initialize a soft heap with error rate formula_13, allowing at most 33% of its inserted keys to be corrupted.
*Insert all formula_9 elements into the heap.
*Repeat formula_15 times: perform a findmin operation and delete the key that it returns.
*Let formula_16 be the deleted element whose correct key is largest.
*Compare formula_16 to all of the given elements, partition them into the subset less than formula_16 and the subset greater than formula_16, placing elements that are equal to formula_16 into the first subset when they were deleted and into the second subset otherwise.
*Recursively call the same selection algorithm in the subset that contains the formula_10th smallest.

After the comparison step of the algorithm, the first of the two subsets contains all of the deleted keys, so it includes at least formula_15 elements.
Among the formula_23 elements that were not deleted, at most formula_15 are corrupted, so at least formula_15 are uncorrupted. These uncorrupted and undeleted elements must all belong to the second subset, because they are greater than or equal to the soft heap&#x27;s (possibly corrupted) value of formula_16, which is in turn greater than the true value of formula_16. Thus, both subsets have between 33% and 66% of the elements. Because each level of recursion reduces the problem size by a constant factor, the total time of the algorithm can be bounded by a geometric series, showing that it is formula_28.

<doc id="546681" wikidata="Q1628477" url="?curid=546681" title="Battle of Diu">
<text>The Battle of Diu was a naval battle fought on 3 February 1509 in the Arabian Sea, in the port of Diu, India, between the Portuguese Empire and a joint fleet of the Sultan of Gujarat, the Mamlûk Burji Sultanate of Egypt and the Zamorin of Calicut.

The Portuguese victory was critical: the great Muslim alliance was soundly defeated, easing the Portuguese strategy of controlling the Indian Ocean to route trade down the Cape of Good Hope, circumventing the historical spice trade controlled by the Arabs and the Venetians through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. After the battle, the Kingdom of Portugal rapidly captured several key ports in the Indian Ocean including Goa, Ceylon, Malacca, Bom Baim and Ormuz. The territorial losses crippled the Mamluk Sultanate and the Gujarat Sultanate. The battle catapulted the growth of the Portuguese Empire and established its political dominance for more than a century. Portuguese power in the East would begin to decline with the sackings of Goa and Bombay-Bassein, Portuguese Restoration War and the Dutch colonisation of Ceylon.

The Battle of Diu was a battle of annihilation similar to the Battle of Lepanto and the Battle of Trafalgar, and one of the most important in world naval history, for it marks the beginning of European dominance over Asian seas that would last until the Second World War.

==Background==
Just two years after Vasco da Gama reached India by sea, the Portuguese realized that the prospect of developing trade such as that which they had practiced in West Africa had become an impossibility, due to the opposition of Muslim merchant elites in the western coast of India, who incited attacks against Portuguese &quot;feitorias&quot;, ships, and agents; sabotaged Portuguese diplomatic efforts; and led the massacre of the Portuguese in Calicut in 1500.

Thus, the Portuguese signed an alliance with a sworn enemy of Calicut instead, the Raja of Cochin, who invited them to establish headquarters. The Zamorin of Calicut invaded Cochin in response, but the Portuguese were able to devastate the lands and cripple the trade of Calicut, then the main exporter of spices back to Europe, through the Red Sea. In December 1504, the Portuguese destroyed the Zamorin&#x27;s yearly merchant fleet, bound for Egypt and laden with spices.

When King Manuel I of Portugal received news of these developments, he decided to nominate Dom Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of India with expressed orders not just limited to safeguarding Portuguese &quot;feitorias&quot;, but also to curb hostile Muslim shipping. Dom Francisco departed from Lisbon in March 1505 with twenty ships and his 20-year-old son, Dom Lourenço, who was himself nominated &quot;capitão-mor do mar da Índia&quot; or captain-major of the sea of India.

Portuguese intervention was seriously disrupting Muslim trade in the Indian Ocean, threatening Venetian interests as well, as the Portuguese became able to undersell the Venetians in the spice trade in Europe.

Unable to oppose the Portuguese, the Muslim communities of traders in India as well as the sovereign of Calicut, the Zamorin, sent envoys to Egypt pleading for aid against the Portuguese.
===The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt===

The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt was, in the beginning of the 16th century, the main middleman between the spice producing regions of India, and the Venetian buyers in the Mediterranean, mainly in Alexandria, who then sold the spices in Europe at a great profit. Egypt was otherwise mostly an agrarian society with little ties to the sea. Venice broke diplomatic relations with Portugal and started looking for ways to counter its intervention in the Indian Ocean, sending an ambassador to the Mamluk court and suggested that &quot;rapid and secret remedies&quot; be taken against the Portuguese.

Mamluk soldiers had little expertise in naval warfare, so the Mamluk Sultan, Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri requested Venetian support, in exchange for lowering tariffs to facilitate competition with the Portuguese. Venice supplied the Mamluks with Mediterranean-type carracks and war galleys manned by Greek sailors, which Venetian shipwrights helped disassemble in Alexandria and reassemble on the Suez. The galleys could mount cannon fore and aft, but not along the gunwales because the guns would interfere with the rowers. The native ships (dhows), with their sewn wood planks, could carry only very light guns.

Command of the expedition was entrusted to a Kurdish Mamluk, former governor of Jeddah, Amir Hussain Al-Kurdi, &quot;Mirocem&quot; in Portuguese. The expedition (referred to by the Portuguese the generic term &quot;the rumes&quot;) included not only Egyptian Mamluks, but also a large number of Turkish, Nubian and Ethiopian mercenaries as well as Venetian gunners Hence, most of the coalition&#x27;s artillery were archers, whom the Portuguese could easily outshoot.

The fleet left Suez in November 1505, 1100 men strong. They were ordered to fortify Jeddah against a possible Portuguese attack and quell rebellions around Suakin and Mecca. They had to spend the monsoon season on the island of Kamaran and landed at Aden at the tip of the Red Sea, where they got involved in costly local politics with the Tahirid Emir, before finally crossing the Indian Ocean.
Hence only in September 1507 did they reach Diu, a city at the mouth of the Gulf of Khambhat, in a journey that could have taken as little as a month to complete at full sail.

===Diu and Malik Ayyaz===

At the time of the arrival of the Portuguese in India, the Gujarati were the main long distance dealers in the Indian Ocean, and an essential intermediary in east–west trade, between Egypt and Malacca, mostly trading cloths and spices. In the 15th century, the Sultan of Gujarat nominated Malik Ayyaz, a former bowman and slave of possible Georgian or Dalmatian origin, as the governor of Diu. A cunning and pragmatic ruler, Malik Ayyaz turned the city into the main port of Gujarat (known to the Portuguese as &quot;Cambaia&quot;) and one of the main entrepôts between India and the Persian Gulf, avoiding Portuguese hostility by pursuing a policy of appeasement and even alignment – up until Hussain unexpectedly sailed into Diu.

Malik Ayyaz received Hussain well, but besides the Zamorin of Calicut, no other rulers of the Indian subcontinent were forthcoming against the Portuguese, unlike what the Muslim envoys to Egypt had promised. Ayyaz himself realized the Portuguese were a formidable naval force whom he did not wish to antagonize. He could not, however, reject Hussain for fear of retaliation from the powerful Sultan of Gujarat – besides obviously Hussain&#x27;s own forces now within the city. Caught in a double bind, Ayyaz decided to only cautiously support Hussain.

===Battle of Chaul===
In March 1508, Hussain&#x27;s and Ayyaz&#x27;s fleets sailed south and clashed with Portuguese ships in a three-day naval engagement within the harbour of Chaul. The Portuguese commander was the captain-major of the seas of India, Lourenço de Almeida, tasked with overseeing the loading of allied merchant ships in that city and escorting them back to Cochin.

Although the Portuguese were caught off guard (the distinctively European-like ships of Hussein were at first thought to belong to the expedition of Afonso de Albuquerque, assigned to the Arabian Coast), the battle ended as a Pyrrhic victory for the Muslims, who suffered too many losses to be able to proceed towards the Portuguese headquarters in Cochin. Despite fortuitously sinking the Portuguese flagship, the rest of the Portuguese fleet escaped, while Hussain himself barely survived the encounter because of the unwilling committal of Malik Ayyaz to the battle. Hussain was left with no other choice but to return to Diu with Malik Ayyaz and prepare for a Portuguese retaliation. Hussain reported this battle back to Cairo as a great victory; however, the &quot;Mirat Sikandari&quot;, a contemporary Persian account of the Kingdom of Gujarat, details this battle as a minor skirmish.

Nevertheless, among the dead was the viceroy&#x27;s own son, Lourenço, whose body was never recovered, despite the best efforts of Malik Ayyaz to retrieve it for the Portuguese viceroy.

==Portuguese preparations==
Upon hearing in Cochin of the death of his only son, Dom Francisco de Almeida was heart-stricken, and retired to his quarters for three days, unwilling to see anyone. The presence of a Mamluk fleet in India posed a grave threat to the Portuguese, but the viceroy now sought to personally exact revenge for the death of his son at the hands of &quot;Mirocem&quot;, supposedly having said that &quot;he who ate the chick must also eat the rooster or pay for it&quot;.

Nevertheless, the monsoon was approaching, and with it the storms that inhibited all navigation in the Indian Ocean until September. Only then could the viceroy call back all available Portuguese ships for repairs in dry dock and assemble his forces in Cochin.

Before they could depart though, on 6 December 1508 Afonso de Albuquerque arrived in Cannanore from the Persian Gulf with orders from the King of Portugal to replace Almeida as governor. Dom Francisco had a personal vendetta against Albuquerque, as the latter had been assigned to the Arabian Coast specifically to prevent Muslim navigation from entering or leaving the Red Sea. Yet his intentions of personally destroying the Muslim fleet in retaliation of his son&#x27;s death became such a personal issue that he refused to allow his appointed successor take office. In doing so, the viceroy was in official rebellion against royal authority, and would rule Portuguese India for another year as such.

On 9 December, the Portuguese fleet departed for Diu.

==&quot;Armada da Índia&quot; on the move==
From Cochin, the Portuguese first passed by Calicut, hoping to intercept the Zamorin&#x27;s fleet, but it had already left for Diu. The armada then anchored in &quot;Baticala&quot;, to quell a dispute between its king and a local Hindu privateer allied to the Portuguese, Timoja. In Honavar, the Portuguese met with Timoja himself, who informed the viceroy of enemy movements. While there, the Portuguese galleys destroyed a fleet of raiders belonging to the Zamorin of Calicut.

At Angediva, the fleet fetched fresh water and Dom Francisco met with an envoy of Malik Ayyaz, though the details of such rendezvous are unknown. While there, the Portuguese were attacked by oar ships of the city of Dabul, unprovoked.

===Dabul===

From Angediva, the Portuguese set sail to Dabul, an important fortified port city belonging to the Sultanate of Bijapur. The captain of the galley &quot;São Miguel&quot;, Paio de Sousa, decided to investigate the harbour and put to shore, but he was ambushed by a force of about 6,000 men and killed, along with other Portuguese. Two days later, the viceroy led his heavily armoured forces ashore and crushed the garrison stationed by the riverbank in an amphibious pincer attack. Dabul paid dearly for the act of provocation, as per the viceroy&#x27;s orders the city was then razed, the surrounding riverside settlements devastated, and almost all their inhabitants killed, along with the cattle and even stray dogs in retaliation.

According to Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, the sack of Dabul gave rise to a &#x27;curse&#x27; on the western coast of India, where one might say: &quot;may the wrath of the franks befall you&quot;.

===Chaul and Bombay===

From Dabul, the Portuguese called at Chaul, where Dom Francisco ordered the governor of the town to prepare a tribute to be collected on the return from Diu. Moving towards Mahim, close to Bombay, the Portuguese found the town deserted.

At Bombay, Dom Francisco received a letter from Malikk Ayyaz. Doubtlessly aware of the danger facing his city, he wrote to appease the viceroy, stating that he had the prisoners and how bravely his son had fought, adding a letter from the Portuguese prisoners stating that they were well treated. The viceroy answered Malik Ayyaz (referred to as Meliqueaz in Portuguese) with a respectful but menacing letter, stating his intention of revenge, that they had better join all forces and prepare to fight or he would destroy Diu:


===Difficulties on the Muslim side===
In the ten months between the Battle of Chaul and Diu, important developments took place on the Muslim field: Hussain took the chance to careen his ships and recovered a straggled carrack with a reinforcement of 300 men. Notwithstanding, the relationship between Hussain and Ayyaz worsened, with Hussain now plainly aware of the duplicity of Ayyaz, who had taken custody of the Portuguese prisoners at Chaul – which Hussain apparently intended &quot;to send back to Cairo stuffed&quot;. Unable to pay the remaining of his troops, Hussain was forced to pawn his own artillery pieces to Ayyaz himself. Presumably, only either the hope of fresh reinforcements or fear of the reaction of the Sultan now prevented him from returning to Egypt.

At this point, should Malik Ayyaz assist Amir Hussain, he risked his city and his life; should he choose to turn on Hussain, the Sultan might take Ayyaz&#x27;s head. If Hussain stood his ground, he risked annihilation and should he retreat, risked being executed by the Sultan of Egypt.

Now in a quadruple bind, they faced the Portuguese forces.

==Order of battle==

===Mamluk-Gujarat-Calicut fleet===
* 6 Mediterranean carracks; 6 &quot;galleys&quot; (overall command of Amir Hussain)
* 4 carracks of Diu (Malik Ayyaz)
* 30 light galleys of Diu (Sidi Ali)
* 70–150 war-boats of Calicut (Kunjali Marakkar)

===Portuguese fleet===
* 5 large &quot;naus&quot;: &quot;Flor de la mar&quot; (Viceroy&#x27;s flagship; captain João da Nova), &quot;Espírito Santo&quot; (captain Nuno Vaz Pereira), &quot;Belém&quot; (Jorge de Melo Pereira), &quot;Rei Grande&quot; (Francisco de Távora), and &quot;Taforea Grande&quot; (Pêro Barreto de Magalhães)
* 4 smaller &quot;naus&quot;: &quot;Taforea Pequena&quot; (Garcia de Sousa), &quot;Santo António&quot; (Martim Coelho), &quot;Rei Pequeno&quot; (Manuel Teles Barreto) and &quot;Andorinha&quot; (Dom António de Noronha)
* 4 square-rigged caravels: &quot;Flor da Rosa&quot; (António do Campo), &quot;Espera&quot; (Filipe Rodrigues), &quot;Conceição&quot; (Pero Cão), &quot;Santa Maria da Ajuda&quot; (Rui Soares)
* 2 caravels: &quot;Santiago&quot; (Luís Preto), – (Álvaro Pessanha)
* 2 galleys: &quot;São Miguel&quot; (Diogo Pires), &quot;São Cristóvão&quot; (Paio Rodrigues de Sousa)
* 1 brigantine: &quot;Santo António&quot; (Simão Martins)

==Battle of Diu==

On 2 February 1509, the Portuguese sighted Diu from atop the crow&#x27;s nests. As they approached, Malik Ayyaz withdrew from the city, leaving overall command to Hussain. He ordered the oar ships to sally out and harass the Portuguese fleet before they had time to recover from the journey, but they did not pass beyond the range of the fortress&#x27;s cannon. As night fell the Muslim fleet retreated into the channel, while the viceroy summoned all his captains to decide on the course of action.

As day broke, the Portuguese could see that the Muslims had decided to take advantage of the harbour of Diu protected by its fort by lashing their carracks and galleys together close to shore and awaiting the Portuguese attack, thus relinquishing the initiative. Portuguese forces were to be divided in four: one group to board the Mamluk carracks after a preliminary bombardment, another to attack the stationary Mamluk galleys from the flank, a &#x27;bombardment group&#x27; that would support the rest of the fleet, and the flagship itself, which would not participate in the boarding, but would position itself in a convenient position to direct the battle and support it with its firepower. The brigantine &quot;Santo António&quot; would ensure communications.

&quot;Santo António&quot; then ran through the fleet delivering the viceroy&#x27;s speech, in which he detailed the reasons for which they sought the enemy, and the rewards to be granted in case of victory: the right to the sack, knighthood to all soldiers, nobility to the knights, criminals banished from the realm would be pardoned and slaves would receive the condition of squires if they were freed within a year.

===Battle starts===
The wind turned, and by about 11:00 am, the royal banner was hoisted atop the &quot;Flor do Mar&quot; and a single shot fired, signaling the start of the battle. At the general cry of &quot;Santiago!&quot; the Portuguese began their approach, with the galley &quot;São Miguel&quot; at the head of the formation, probing the channel. A general bombardment between the two forces preceded the grapple, and within the calm waters of the harbour of Diu, the Portuguese employed an innovative gunnery tactic: by firing directly at the water, the cannonballs bounced like skipping stones. A broadside from the &quot;Santo Espírito&quot; hit one of the enemy ships by the waterline, sinking it instantly.
As the carracks made contact, Hussain&#x27;s flagship was grappled by the &quot;Santo Espírito&quot;. When their forecastles crossed, a group of men led by Rui Pereira jumped onto the enemy forecastle, and before the ships were secured, the Portuguese had already stormed all the way to midship. Before the flagship was captured though, another Mamluk carrack came to its aid, boarding the &quot;Santo Espírito&quot; from the opposite side. Hussain had strengthened his forces with a great number of Gujarati soldiers, distributed across the ships, and the heavily armoured Portuguese infantry suddenly risked being overwhelmed. Rui Pereira was killed, but at this crucial moment, the &quot;Rei Grande&quot; slammed against the free side of Hussain&#x27;s flagship, delivering direly needed reinforcements, which tipped the scales in favour of the Portuguese.

Up on the crow&#x27;s nests, Ethiopian and Turkish bowmen proved their worth against Portuguese matchlock crews. Many of the other Muslim mercenaries &quot;fled at the first sight of the Portuguese&quot;.

Hussain had expected the Portuguese to commit their entire forces to the grapple, so he kept the light oar ships back within the channel, to attack the Portuguese from behind when they engaged the carracks. Comprehending the stratagem, João da Nova maneuvered the &quot;Flor do Mar&quot; to block the channel entrance and prevent the oar ships from sallying out. The compact mass of oar ships provided an ideal target for Portuguese gunners, who disabled many ships that then blocked the path of the ones following. Unable to break through, the Zamorin&#x27;s boats turned around after a short exchange, and retreated to Calicut. Throughout the course of the battle, the &quot;Flor do Mar&quot; fired over 600 shots.

Meanwhile, the faster group of galleys and caravels grappled the flank of the stationary enemy galleys, whose guns were unable to respond. An initial Portuguese assault was repelled, but a Portuguese salvo set three of the galleys adrift.

Slowly but surely, the Portuguese secured most of the carracks, half-blinded by the smoke. Hussain&#x27;s flagship was overpowered and many crewmen began jumping ship. The galleys were defeated, and the shallow caravels positioned themselves between the ships and the coast, cutting down any who attempted to swim ashore.

Eventually, only a single ship remained – a great carrack, larger than any other vessel in the battle, anchored too close to shore for most of the deep-draught Portuguese vessels to reach. Its reinforced hull was impervious to Portuguese cannon fire and it took a continuous bombardment from the whole fleet to finally sink it by dusk, thus marking the end of the Battle of Diu.

==Aftermath==
The battle ended in victory for the Portuguese, with the Gujarat-Mamluk-Calicut coalition all but defeated. The Mamluks fought bravely to the very end, but were at a loss as to how to counter a naval force the like of which they had never seen before. The Portuguese had modern ships crewed by seasoned sailors, better equipped infantry – with heavy plate armour, arquebuses, and a type of clay grenade filled with gunpowder – more cannon and gunners more proficient in an art the Mamluks could not hope to match.

After the battle, Malik Ayyaz returned the prisoners of Chaul, well dressed and fed. Dom Francisco refused to take over Diu, claiming that it would be expensive to maintain, but signed a trade agreement with Ayyaz and opened a &quot;feitoria&quot; in the city. The Portuguese would later seek ardently the construction of a fortress at Diu, but the Malik managed to postpone this for as long as he was governor.

The spoils of the battle included three galleys, three carracks, 600 bronze artillery pieces, and three royal flags of the Mamlûk Sultan of Cairo that were sent to Portugal to be displayed in the Convento de Cristo, in Tomar, headquarters of the Order of Christ, former Knights Templar, of which Almeida was a member. The Viceroy extracted from the merchants of Diu (who funded the refitting of the Muslim fleet) a payment of 300,000 gold xerafins, 100,000 of which were distributed among the troops and 10,000 donated to the hospital of Cochin.

The treatment of the Mamluk captives by the Portuguese however, was brutal. The Viceroy ordered most of them to be hanged, burned alive, or torn to pieces, tied to the mouths of cannon, in retaliation for his son&#x27;s death. Commenting in the aftermath of the battle, Almeida reported to King Manuel: &quot;As long as you may be powerful at sea, you will hold India as yours; and if you do not possess this power, little will avail you a fortress on the shore.&quot; After handing over the Viceroy&#x27;s post to Afonso de Albuquerque and leaving for Portugal in November 1509, Almeida was himself killed in December in a skirmish against the Khoikhoi tribe near the Cape of Good Hope, along with 70 other Portuguese – more than in the Battle of Diu. His body was buried on the beach.

Hussain survived the battle, and managed to flee Diu along with 22 other Mamluks on horseback. He returned to Cairo, and several years later was put in charge of another fleet with 3,000 men to be sent against the Portuguese, but he was murdered on the Red Sea, by his Turkish second-in-command – future Selman Reis of the Ottoman navy. The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt would collapse to an Ottoman invasion shortly after.

Of all the leading participants of the Battle of Diu, Malik Ayyaz would be the only one not to die a violent death; he died a wealthy man in his estate in 1522.

===Legacy===
The Battle of Diu is considered one of the most important battles in history. It marked the beginning of Western European dominance in the Indian Ocean. The author William Weir in his book &quot;50 Battles That Changed the World&quot;, ranks this battle as the 6th most important in history, losing only to the Battle of Marathon, the Nika Rebellion, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Arbela (Gaugamela) and the Battle of Hattin. He says: &quot;When the 15th century began, Islam seemed about ready to dominate the world. That prospect sank in the Indian Ocean off Diu.&quot; The historian Rainer Daehnhardt says that this battle is compared only to the Battles of Lepanto and Trafalgar in terms of importance and legacy. According to the scholar &quot;Michael Adas&quot;, this battle &quot;established European Naval superiority in the Indian Ocean for centuries to come.&quot;

<doc id="546684" wikidata="Q2642214" url="?curid=546684" title="Exposition (narrative)">
<text>Narrative exposition, now often simply exposition, is the insertion of background information within a story or narrative. This information can be about the setting, characters&#x27; backstories, prior plot events, historical context, etc. In literature, exposition appears in the form of expository writing embedded within the narrative.

== Infodumping ==
An &quot;information dump&quot; (more commonly now, &quot;infodump&quot;) is a large drop of information by the author to provide background they deem necessary to continue the plot. This is ill-advised in narrative and is even worse when used in dialogue. There are cases where an information dump can work, but in many instances it slows down the plot or breaks immersion for the readers. Exposition works best when the author provides only the bare minimum of surface information and allows the readers to discover as they go.

== Indirect exposition/incluing ==

&quot;Indirect exposition&quot;, sometimes called , is a technique of worldbuilding in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to &quot;clue&quot; the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through dialogues, flashbacks, characters&#x27; thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a backstory.

Indirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified in the modern literary world, in the writing of Rudyard Kipling. In his stories set in India like &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kipling&#x27;s science fiction stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his Aerial Board of Control universe, starting with the novella &quot;With the Night Mail&quot; (1905).

Kipling&#x27;s writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the &quot;Dean of Science Fiction&quot;, Robert Heinlein, who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition.

The word &quot;incluing&quot; is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author Jo Walton. She defined it as &quot;the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information.&quot; &quot;Information dump&quot; (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid. In an &quot;idiot lecture&quot;, characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware. Writers are advised to avoid writing dialogues beginning with &quot;As you well know, Professor, a prime number is...&quot;

<doc id="546712" wikidata="Q3338704" url="?curid=546712" title="Neurotoxicity">
<text>Neurotoxicity is a form of toxicity in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system. It occurs when exposure to a substance – specifically, a neurotoxin or neurotoxicant– alters the normal activity of the nervous system in such a way as to cause permanent or reversible damage to nervous tissue. This can eventually disrupt or even kill neurons, which are cells that transmit and process signals in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Neurotoxicity can result from organ transplants, radiation treatment, certain drug therapies, recreational drug use, exposure to heavy metals, bites from certain species of venomous snakes, pesticides, certain industrial cleaning solvents, fuels and certain naturally occurring substances. Symptoms may appear immediately after exposure or be delayed. They may include limb weakness or numbness, loss of memory, vision, and/or intellect, uncontrollable obsessive and/or compulsive behaviors, delusions, headache, cognitive and behavioral problems and sexual dysfunction. Chronic mold exposure in homes can lead to neurotoxicity which may not appear for months to years of exposure. All symptoms listed above are consistent with mold mycotoxin accumulation.

The term &quot;neurotoxicity&quot; implies the involvement of a neurotoxin; however, the term &quot;neurotoxic&quot; may be used more loosely to describe states that are known to cause physical brain damage, but where no specific neurotoxin has been identified.

The presence of neurocognitive deficits alone is not usually considered sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity, as many substances may impair neurocognitive performance without resulting in the death of neurons. This may be due to the direct action of the substance, with the impairment and neurocognitive deficits being temporary, and resolving when the substance is eliminated from the body. In some cases the level or exposure-time may be critical, with some substances only becoming neurotoxic in certain doses or time periods. Some of the most common naturally occurring brain toxins that lead to neurotoxicity as a result of long term drug use are amyloid beta (Aβ), glutamate, dopamine, and oxygen radicals. When present in high concentrations, they can lead to neurotoxicity and death (apoptosis). Some of the symptoms that result from cell death include loss of motor control, cognitive deterioration and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Additionally, neurotoxicity has been found to be a major cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD).

==Neurotoxic agents==

===Amyloid beta===
Amyloid beta (Aβ) was found to cause neurotoxicity and cell death in the brain when present in high concentrations. Aβ results from a mutation that occurs when protein chains are cut at the wrong locations, resulting in chains of different lengths that are unusable. Thus they are left in the brain until they are broken down, but if enough accumulate, they form plaques which are toxic to neurons. Aβ uses several routes in the central nervous system to cause cell death. An example is through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchRs), which is a receptor commonly found along the surfaces of the cells that respond to nicotine stimulation, turning them on or off. Aβ was found manipulating the level of nicotine in the brain along with the MAP kinase, another signaling receptor, to cause cell death. Another chemical in the brain that Aβ regulates is JNK; this chemical halts the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway, which normally functions as memory control in the brain. As a result, this memory favoring pathway is stopped, and the brain loses essential memory function. The loss of memory is a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, including AD. Another way Aβ causes cell death is through the phosphorylation of AKT; this occurs as the phosphate group is bound to several sites on the protein. This phosphorylation allows AKT to interact with BAD, a protein known to cause cell death. Thus an increase in Aβ results in an increase of the AKT/BAD complex, in turn stopping the action of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which normally functions to stop cell death, causing accelerated neuron breakdown and the progression of AD.

===Glutamate===
Glutamate is a chemical found in the brain that poses a toxic threat to neurons when found in high concentrations. This concentration equilibrium is extremely delicate and is usually found in millimolar amounts extracellularly. When disturbed, an accumulation of glutamate occurs as a result of a mutation in the glutamate transporters, which act like pumps to clear glutamate from the synapse. This causes glutamate concentration to be several times higher in the blood than in the brain; in turn, the body must act to maintain equilibrium between the two concentrations by pumping the glutamate out of the bloodstream and into the neurons of the brain. In the event of a mutation, the glutamate transporters are unable to pump the glutamate back into the cells; thus a higher concentration accumulates at the glutamate receptors. This opens the ion channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell causing excitotoxicity. Glutamate results in cell death by turning on the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDA); these receptors cause an increased release of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the cells. As a result, the increased concentration of Ca2+ directly increases the stress on mitochondria, resulting in excessive oxidative phosphorylation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the activation of nitric oxide synthase, ultimately leading to cell death. Aβ was also found aiding this route to neurotoxicity by enhancing neuron vulnerability to glutamate.

===Oxygen radicals===
The formation of oxygen radicals in the brain is achieved through the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. This reaction occurs as a response to an increase in the Ca2+ concentration inside a brain cell. This interaction between the Ca2+ and NOS results in the formation of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which then moves from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. As a final step, NOS is dephosphorylated yielding nitric oxide (NO), which accumulates in the brain, increasing its oxidative stress. There are several ROS, including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl, all of which lead to neurotoxicity. Naturally, the body utilizes a defensive mechanism to diminish the fatal effects of the reactive species by employing certain enzymes to break down the ROS into small, benign molecules of simple oxygen and water. However, this breakdown of the ROS is not completely efficient; some reactive residues are left in the brain to accumulate, contributing to neurotoxicity and cell death. The brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress than other organs, due to its low oxidative capacity. Because neurons are characterized as postmitotic cells, meaning that they live with accumulated damage over the years, accumulation of ROS is fatal. Thus, increased levels of ROS age neurons, which leads to accelerated neurodegenerative processes and ultimately the advancement of AD.

=== Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity ===

==== Endogenous ====
The endogenously produced autotoxin metabolite of dopamine, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), is a potent inducer of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in dopaminergic neurons. DOPAL may play an important role in the pathology of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==== Drug induced ====
Certain drugs, most famously the pesticide and metabolite MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridin-1-ium) can induce Parkinson&#x27;s disease by destroying dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. MPP+ interacts with the electron transport chain in the mitochondria to generate reactive oxygen species which cause generalized oxidative damage and ultimately cell death. MPP+ is produced by monoamine oxidase B as a metabolite of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), and its toxicity is particularly significant to dopaminergic neurons because of an active transporter on those cells that bring it into the cytoplasm. The neurotoxicity of MPP+ was first investigated after MPTP was produced as a contaminant in the pethidine synthesized by a chemistry graduate student, who injected the contaminated drug and developed overt Parkinson&#x27;s within weeks. Discovery of the mechanism of toxicity was an important advance in the study of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and the compound is now used to induce the disease in research animals.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends upon the length and degree of exposure and the severity of neurological injury. In some instances, exposure to neurotoxins or neurotoxicants can be fatal. In others, patients may survive but not fully recover. In other situations, many individuals recover completely after treatment.

The word &quot;neurotoxicity&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, yielding &quot;nervous tissue poisoning&quot;.

<text>Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown () is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Leinster and the Eastern and Midland Region. It is one of three successor counties to County Dublin, which was disestablished in 1994. It is named after the former borough of Dún Laoghaire and the barony of Rathdown. Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 233,860 at the time of the 2022 census.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown is bordered to the east by the Irish Sea, to the north by the city of Dublin, to the west by the county of South Dublin, and to the south by County Wicklow. With the city of Dublin, Fingal and South Dublin, it is one of four local government areas in the old County Dublin. Located to the south-east of the capital city of Dublin, the county town of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown is Dún Laoghaire. Since 2015, the county is part of the Eastern and Midland Region. University College Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology are located in the county.

==Administrative history==
In 1986, the administrative county of Dublin was divided into three &quot;electoral counties&quot;: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Dublin—Fingal, and Dublin—Belgard. The city has been administered separately from County Dublin since 1548. An &quot;area committee&quot; for the electoral county was formed within Dublin County Council under the Local Government Act 1991,

On 1 January 1994, County Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire were abolished and the three electoral counties became the administrative counties of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin respectively. Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown comprises the former Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the south-eastern part of the former County Dublin. Additionally, the powers of the former Deansgrange Joint Burial Board were subsumed into the new authority. From 2002, all &quot;administrative counties&quot; in Ireland were redesignated as &quot;counties&quot;. The three counties together with Dublin city constitute the traditional County Dublin.

==Naming==
The coastal town of Dún Laoghaire (called &quot;Dunleary&quot; until 1821 and then &quot;Kingstown&quot; until 1920) gave its name to the larger borough of Dún Laoghaire established in 1930. Rathdown was the south-easternmost barony in County Dublin, named after Rathdown Castle. When County Wicklow was created south of County Dublin in 1606, half of Rathdown was transferred to Wicklow, including Rathdown Castle, now a ruin. From the 1840s, the poor law union (PLU) of Rathdown covered all of the Wicklow barony and most of the Dublin barony, with part of Uppercross. From the Dublin and Wicklow sections of the PLU, the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 created rural districts respectively named Rathdown No. 1 and Rathdown No. 2, abolished in 1930 and 1925. Rathdown PLU survived as Rathdown Public Assistance District until 1960. Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown was a Dáil constituency created by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947 coterminous with the former Rathdown No. 1 rural district.

The name &quot;Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown&quot; was given to the electoral county created in 1985. Before its establishment as an administrative county, possible alternative names before deciding to retain &quot;Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown&quot;. The Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993 named it &quot;Dun Laoghaire–Rathdown&quot; in English, omitting the on the &quot;u&quot; of &quot;Dun&quot;, and in Irish. The 1993 act empowered Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council (DLRCC) to apply to change the county&#x27;s name, but this was not invoked.

The spelling in English as &quot;Dun Laoghaire–Rathdown&quot;, without the , is used in the list of counties in the Local Government Act 2001 (and as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014). However, in the Placenames Database of Ireland and the ministerial order under the Official Languages Act 2003, the name of the county in English is &quot;Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown&quot;. This is followed by the County Council, with the used in English.

The placenames order also distinguishes between the use of &quot;County&quot; as a prefix for the traditional counties, but not in the case of &quot;Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown&quot; and other counties listed as &quot;administrative counties&quot;.

==Local government and politics==

Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council is the local authority for the county. There are six local electoral areas (LEAs) for the county which return a total of 40 councillors as follows: Blackrock (6), Dundrum (7), Dún Laoghaire (7), Glencullen–Sandyford (7), Killiney–Shankill (7), and Stillorgan (6).

For elections to Dáil Éireann, the county is split between the Dáil constituencies of Dún Laoghaire (4 TDs) and Dublin Rathdown (3 TDs), with the division generally running along the N11. These constituencies currently have three Fine Gael TDs, two Green Party TDs, one Fianna Fáil TD and one People Before Profit–Solidarity TD.

It is part of the 4-seat Dublin constituency in European Parliament elections.

==County motto==
The motto on the insignia of the County Council reads, , Irish for &quot;From Harbour to Mountain&quot;. The crown in the device is that of Lóegaire mac Néill, a legendary 5th-century High King of Ireland and the eponymous Laoghaire of &quot;Dún Laoghaire&quot;.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) system runs through the eastern coast of the county and connects to Dublin city centre to the north as well as other points north and south on the Iarnród Éireann railway system, with connections to Intercity and commuter trains. The Luas Green Line runs through the centre of the county.

There is a medium-sized harbour at Dún Laoghaire, with now discontinued ferry crossings to and from Holyhead in North Wales; this was a popular route for tourists travelling across the Irish Sea from Britain. This service was suspended indefinitely in September 2014.

<doc id="546729" wikidata="Q147295" url="?curid=546729" title="Cyclamen">
<text>Cyclamen ( or ) is a genus of 23 species of perennial flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. In English, it is known by the common names sowbread or swinebread. &quot;Cyclamen&quot; species are native to Europe and the Mediterranean Basin east to the Caucasus and Iran, with one species in Somalia. They grow from tubers and are valued for their flowers with upswept petals and variably patterned leaves.

It was traditionally classified in the family Primulaceae, was reclassified in the family Myrsinaceae in 2000 and finally, in 2009 with the introduction of the APG III system, was returned to the subfamily Myrsinoideae within the family Primulaceae.

==Names==
&quot;Cyclamen&quot; is Medieval Latin, from earlier Latin &quot;cyclamīnos&quot;, from Ancient Greek κυκλάμινος, &quot;kyklā́mīnos&quot; (also &quot;kyklāmī́s&quot;), from κύκλος, &quot;kýklos&quot; &quot;circle&quot;, because of the round tuber. In English the species of the genus are commonly called by the genus name.

Pliny the Elder describes how it was called in antiquity by Roman country men: &quot;tūber terrae,&quot; literally &quot;earth truffle&quot; or also &quot;amulētum&quot; &quot;amulet&quot;, because it was believed that evil spells had no effect where it grew.

In many languages cyclamen species are colloquially called by a name like the English sowbread or swinebread (because they are said to be eaten by pigs), based on Medieval Latin &quot;panis porcinus&quot;: &quot;Saubrot&quot; in German, &quot;pain de pourceau&quot; in French, &quot;pan porcino&quot; in Italian and &quot;varkensbrood&quot; in Dutch.

==Description==
Cyclamen have a tuber, from which the leaves, flowers and roots grow. In most species leaves come up in autumn, grow through the winter and then die in spring, then the plant goes &quot;dormant&quot; through the dry Mediterranean summer.

===Tuber===
The storage organ of the cyclamen is a round tuber, which develops from the hypocotyl (the stem of a seedling). It is often mistakenly called a corm, but a corm (found in crocuses, for example) has a papery tunic and a basal plate from which the roots grow. The storage organ of the cyclamen has no papery covering and, depending on the species, roots may grow out of any part. It is therefore properly classified as a tuber (somewhat like a potato). The tuber may produce roots from the top, sides or bottom, depending on the species. &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; root from the bottom; &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; roots from the top and sides. &quot;Cyclamen graecum&quot; has thick anchor roots on the bottom. The roots and tubes of cyclamen plants are known to contain the compound cyclamin.

The shape of the tuber may be near spherical, as in &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot;, or flattened, as in &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot;. In some older specimens of &quot;Cyclamen purpurascens&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen rohlfsianum&quot; growing points on the tuber become separated by shoulders of tissue and the tuber becomes misshapen. In most other species the tuber is round in old age.

Leaves and flowers sprout from growing points on the top of the tuber. Growing points that have lengthened and become like woody stems are known as floral trunks.

The size of the tuber varies depending on species. In &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; older tubers commonly reach across, but in &quot;Cyclamen parviflorum&quot; tubers do not grow larger than across.

===Leaves===

Leaves sprout from growing points or floral trunks on top of the tuber. Each leaf grows on its own stem. Leaf stems in early growth may be distinguished from flower stems by the direction their tips curl: tips of leaf stems curl upwards and those of flower stems curl downwards.

The shape of the leaves varies among the species and even among different specimens of the same species. &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen repandum&quot; usually have leaves shaped like ivy, with angles and lobes, &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; has nearly round leaves and &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot; has heart-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The leaf margin may be smooth, as in &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; subsp. &quot;coum&quot;, or finely toothed, as in &quot;Cyclamen graecum&quot;.

The color of the upper side of leaves is variable, even within a species. Most species have leaves variegated in several shades of green and silver, either in an irregular pattern of blotches or an arrowhead or Christmas-tree shape. In cultivation cyclamen, especially species other than &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot;, are selected as often for striking or unusual leaf patterns as for their flowers.

The lower side of leaves is often shiny and its color varies from plain green to rich red or purple.

Most cyclamen species originate from the Mediterranean, where summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and wet, and are summer-dormant: their leaves sprout in the autumn, remain through the winter and wither the next spring. &quot;Cyclamen purpurascens&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen colchicum&quot;, however, originate from cooler regions in mountains and their leaves remain through the summer and wither only after the next year&#x27;s leaves have developed.

===Flowers===

Flowering time may be any month of the year, depending on the species. &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen purpurascens&quot; bloom in summer and autumn, &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; bloom in winter and &quot;Cyclamen repandum&quot; blooms in spring.

Each flower is on a stem coming from a growing point on the tuber. In all species the stem is normally bent 150-180° at the tip so that the nose of the flower faces downwards. &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; &#x27;Stargazer&#x27; is an exception: its nose faces upwards. Flowers have 5 petals, bent outwards or up, sometimes twisted, and connected at the base into a cup, and five sepals behind the cup.

Petal shape varies depending on species and sometimes within the same species. &quot;Cyclamen repandum&quot; has petals much longer than wide, &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; has stubby, almost round petals, and &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; usually has petals with proportions between the two.

Petal color may be white, pink or purple, often with darker color on the nose. Many species have a pink form and a white form but a few have only one color, such as &quot;Cyclamen balearicum&quot;, which is always white.

The dark color on the flower nose varies in shape: &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot; has a smooth band, &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; has a streaky V and &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; has an M-shaped splotch with two white or pink ‘eyes’ beneath.

In some species, such as &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot;, the petal edges at the nose are curved outwards into &quot;auricles&quot; (Latin for ‘little ears’). Most species, such as &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot;, have no auricles.

In most species the style protrudes 1–3 mm out of the nose of the flower but the stamens are inside the flower. In &quot;Cyclamen rohlfsianum&quot;, however, the cone of anthers sticks out prominently, about beyond the rim of the corolla, similar to shooting-stars (&quot;Primula&quot; sect. &quot;Dodecatheon&quot;).

===Fruit===
The flower stem coils or bends when the fruit begins to form. The stems of &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; and &quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; coil starting at the end, &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot; arches downwards but does not curl, &quot;Cyclamen rohlfsianum&quot; coils start near the tuber and &quot;Cyclamen graecum&quot; coils in both directions, starting in the middle.

The fruit is a round pod, which opens by several flaps or teeth at maturity and contains numerous sticky seeds, brown at maturity. Natural seed dispersal is by ants (myrmecochory), which eat the sticky covering and then discard the seeds.
==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Cyclamen&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753.

=== Phylogeny ===
A phylogeny of &quot;Cyclamen&quot; published in 2000, with four supported clades approximately corresponding to four subgenera, is shown below. The phylogeny is based on morphology, cytology and DNA-sequences. A few species that were not included in the analysis are placed based on morphology only and are noted with a question mark. 
A study published in 2004 produced a similar phylogeny in a combined analysis of molecular and morphological data:
A comparison of the groups produced in the two studies shows them to be very similar (see the table below). Nevertheless, the authors of the 2004 study declined to produce a subgeneric classification, concluding that more work was needed to align the phylogeny and classification of &quot;Cyclamen&quot;, stating that &quot;the publication of formal classifications before adequate data can provide a clear and consistent pattern of information, leads to nomenclatural instability&quot;.

===Species===
, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species:

*&quot;Cyclamen africanum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen alpinum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen balearicum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen cilicium&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen colchicum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen coum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen creticum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen cyprium&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen graecum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen intaminatum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen libanoticum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen mirabile&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen parviflorum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen pseudibericum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen purpurascens&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen repandum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen rohlfsianum&quot; 
*&quot;Cyclamen somalense&quot; 
==Ecology==
Cyclamen species are eaten by the caterpillars of the gothic moth.

==Conservation==
Cyclamen diversity in the Mediterranean has been studied extensively to understand how the species remain distinct (Debussche et al., 2000, 2002, 2003) and how they have reacted to the dramatic climate changes in the region. Certain climate-change models suggest many species could become extinct in their current range within the next 50 years.

In many areas within the native range cyclamen populations have been severely depleted by collection from the wild, often illegally, for the horticultural trade; some species are now endangered as a result. However in a few areas plant-conservation charities have educated local people to control the harvest carefully at a sustainable level, including sowing seed for future crops, both sustaining the wild populations and producing a reliable long-term income. Many cyclamen are also propagated in nurseries without harm to the wild plants.

== Culture ==
In the sixteenth century, women in their early stages of pregnancy avoided cyclamens in fear of a miscarriage because they were considered to strongly induce childbirth.

Cyclamens were used as love-charms, aphrodisiacs, and intoxicant and a small amount would be put in cakes or a cup of wine.

==Cultivation and uses==
Cyclamen are commonly grown for their flowers, both outdoors and indoors in pots. Several species, particularly &quot;Cyclamen hederifolium&quot;, are hardy and can be grown outdoors in mild climates such as northwest Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America.

The Cyclamen Society is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for &quot;Cyclamen&quot; excluding &quot;C. persicum&quot;, and currently recognises over 100 registered cultivars.

Cyclamen flowers have a subtle scent that is reminiscent of both lily of the valley and rose. The cyclamen note is used in perfumery to give clean, watercolor-like scent. Example of a perfume with a leading cyclamen note is Masaki Shiro by the Japanese brand Masaki Matsushima.

===Hardiness===
Cyclamen species range from frost-hardy to frost-tender.

The most frost-hardy species, such as &quot;C. purpurascens&quot;, &quot;C. hederifolium&quot;, &quot;C. coum&quot; and &quot;C. cilicium&quot;, tolerate temperatures down to . &quot;C. hederifolium&quot; has even survived prolonged freezing and temperatures down to . &quot;C. repandum&quot; survives temperatures down to but not prolonged freezing below this temperature. &quot;C. graecum&quot; tolerates frost as low as for a few hours. Others, such as &quot;C. africanum&quot;, &quot;C. persicum&quot; and &quot;C. rohlfsianum&quot;, tolerate only mild and brief frost.

===Florists’ cyclamen===
The cyclamen commonly sold by florists is &quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot;, which is frost-tender. Selected cyclamen cultivars have white, bright pink, red or purple flowers. While flowering florists&#x27; cyclamen should be kept below , with the night-time temperatures preferably . Temperatures above may induce the plant to become dormant.

<doc id="546737" wikidata="Q1056074" url="?curid=546737" title="Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada">
<text>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC; ) is the department of the Government of Canada with responsibility for matters dealing with immigration to Canada, refugees, and Canadian citizenship. The department was established in 1994 following a reorganization.

== Organization ==
The Departmental Results Report (2018–2019), stated that a total of 7,414 full-time equivalent employees are currently employed with IRCC. The same report states that IRCC plans to have 7,378 full-time equivalent employees in 2019–2020 and 7304 in 2020–2021.

=== Organizational structure ===
=== Mandate, role and objective ===

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada&#x27;s mandate is specified in the &quot;Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act&quot;. The Minister of IRCC administers the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; of 1977 and its subsequent amendments. The Minister of IRCC works closely with the Minister of Public Safety in relation to the administration of the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot;.

IRCC, together with its partners, has the responsibility of conducting &quot;the screening of potential permanent and temporary residents to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians.&quot; The issuance and control of Canadian passports and other travel documents that facilitate the travel of Canadian citizens, permanent residents and protected persons is also under the responsibility of IRCC.

In collaboration with its partners,&quot;&quot;&quot; IRCC will continue to work to build a &quot;stronger Canada&quot; in promoting programs and services geared towards helping newcomers to successfully integrate and fully live the Canadian way of life, maximizing their abilities to help build better communities. Instill in them the values, duties and responsibilities as new Canadians without prejudice regardless of their race and religious beliefs. It also aims to advance in terms of its immigration and humanitarian activities and policies.

The objective of IRCC is to be instrumental in helping build a stronger Canada through immigration which aims to continue its humanitarian efforts that is known all over the world. The vision is to solidify the goal of creating a stable economic agenda as well as its social and cultural landscape.

==History==
&quot;Further Information: History of immigration to Canada&quot;

Prior to the establishment of the &quot;Naturalization Act&quot; of 1947, persons who were born in Canada, as well as those who were naturalized Canadians regardless of their country of origin, were all categorized as British subjects. Therefore, during these times, &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;citizenship&quot; referred to people living in Canada rather than those in possession of Canadian citizenship status.

When the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; was put in place, it formalized the sense of nationalism and Canadian identity to its citizenry. Under the &quot;British North America Act&quot; of 1867, immigration responsibilities were shared by the federal government and provincial/territorial governments and commissions.
=== Citizenship and immigration legislations ===
Immigration and citizenship legislation are laws that set standards, policies and practices in accordance with the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot;. The following is the chronology of Canadian immigration and citizenship laws.
== Facilities ==
IRCC operates a large network of &quot;Citizenship and Immigration Centres&quot; throughout Canada such as Case Processing Centres (CPCs), Centralized Intake Offices (CIOs), and Operations Support Centres (OPCs), as well as an important number of embassies, high commissions, and consulates abroad.

=== Domestic ===
=== International ===
Canadian embassies and consular offices across the world play an important role in safeguarding its citizens while abroad. There are identified countries in different regions around the globe that are strategically located and serve as case processing centres for students, temporary residents, visitors, refugees and landed immigrants visa applications.

Service Canada is responsible for some of the domestic field operations of the department, while the Canada Border Services Agency controls enforcement and entry control at ports of entry.

IRCC remains responsible for the establishment of policies and processing of permanent and temporary resident visa, refugee protection and citizenship applications.

== Acts and regulations ==

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada was created and is guided by the principles provided in specific Canadian laws. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom is its guiding light in enforcing immigration policies and laws, and preserving human rights. The below list of acts and regulations highlights the guiding principles for IRCC&#x27;s operations and dealings with other organizations, both in Canada and abroad.

=== Acts ===

Enumerated below are the Acts that are used and applied under any circumstances related to Canadian immigration, refugees, and citizenship.
=== Regulations ===

Canadian regulations are enacted by the Parliament of Canada and are carried out as provided by the law. Regulations are generally sets of rules but have the weight of the rule of law, they can be more detailed such as &quot;include definitions, licensing requirements, performance specifications, exemptions, forms, etc.&quot; The acts that govern IRCC are backed up with these sets of regulations.
==Funding==

The Departmental Results Report for 2018–2019 reported that the actual spending amount by IRCC was . The budget was spent through various immigration programs.

As part of an initiative called the &quot;Settlement Program and Resettlement Assistance Program,&quot; updated application forms are provided online by IRCC for available funding opportunities for settlement organizations across Canada. This program supports partners in providing services that enable smooth transitions for the settlement of newcomers. The services can vary from language skills development in both official languages (English and French), employment opportunities banking on the newcomers educational backgrounds and skills. The four areas of focus for the program are:

# &quot;information and orientation;&quot; 
# &quot;language training and skills development;&quot;
# &quot;labour market access;&quot; and
# &quot;welcoming communities.&quot;

IRCC also funds the Refugee Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) by financing individual or family asylum seekers in finding temporary accommodations upon arrival in Canada, and eventually, locating a permanent place to live, supporting the ability to purchase daily basic needs and providing assistance with the development of general life skills.

The Government of Canada welcomed 25,000 Syrian Refugees by the end of February 2016 and also partook in funding this commitment in opening doors to this specific group of refugees. The refugees came into the country in three different refugee immigration schemes and are given up to 6 months of financial aid until they can fully stand on their own:

# Privately Sponsored Refugees (PSRs), who were financially supported by private citizens or organizations;
# Government Assisted Refugees (GARs), who were funded by IRCC through the Refugee RAP; and
# Blended Visa Office-Referred Refugees (BVORs), which is a type of refugee classified by UNCHR and subsequently paired with Canadian private sponsors.

==Citizenship Commission==

Under Immigration, Refugees and Immigration Canada, the Citizenship Commission is responsible for the administration of citizenship grants to new applications who are admissible for Canadian citizenship. Composed of citizenship judges across Canada, the Commission&#x27;s mandate is to administer Oath of Citizenship; process and approve citizenship applications that meet residency requirements; educate new citizens with their civil responsibilities as new Canadians; and &quot;to promote citizenship in communities.&quot;

Decisions will be made according to individual application circumstances, hence, making each citizenship judge unique and &quot;independent decision makers.&quot; However, their decisions are subject for judicial review by the citizenship applicants and by the Minister of IRCC. Citizenship judges must follow the principles provided by administrative law and natural justice as well as the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot;, Citizenship Regulations and other relevant precedents applicable to each individual case.

=== Citizenship judges ===

Citizenship judges are obliged to obey the mandate as stated by the Citizenship Commission under the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; and the Citizenship Regulations. They provide citizenship application assessment ensuring that the applicants meet the necessary requirements, such as residency, they will administer the Oath of Citizenship during ceremonies and review the rights, privileges and duties of a Canadian citizen, conduct hearings, and supply written decisions following timeline set by the regulation. They are also asked to maintain the integrity of the citizenship application process.

The following are those currently serving, as of November 1, 2018, as citizenship judges:

*Suzanne Carrière
*Hardish Dhaliwal
*Carol-Ann Hart
*Rochelle Ivri
*Joan Mahoney
*Marie Senécal-Tremblay
*Rania Sfeir
*Rodney Simmons
*Maj. Claude Villeneuve

<doc id="546740" wikidata="Q348209" url="?curid=546740" title="Dom DeLuise">
<text>Dominick DeLuise (August 1, 1933 – May 4, 2009) was an American actor, comedian, director, chef, and author. Known primarily for comedy roles, he rose to fame in the 1970s as a frequent guest on television variety shows. He is widely recognized for his performances in the films of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, as well as a series of collaborations and a double act with Burt Reynolds. Beginning in the 1980s, his popularity expanded to younger audiences from voicing characters in several major animated productions, particularly those of Don Bluth.

==Early life==
DeLuise was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Italian American parents Vincenza &quot;Jennie&quot; (née DeStefano), a homemaker, and John DeLuise, a public employee (garbage collector).&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1999-jan-10-cl-62046&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of three children, having an older brother, Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; DeLuise, and an older sister, Antoinette DeLuise-Daurio. DeLuise graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts and later attended Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, where he majored in biology. DeLuise was Roman Catholic and had a particular devotion to the Virgin Mary.

==Career==
DeLuise&#x27;s paid stage debut, at age 18, of &quot;Bernie the dog&quot; was in the drama &quot;Bernie″s Christmas Wish&quot;. His first steady gig was as an intern at the Cleveland Play House, 1952–54, as stage manager and actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleveland/2009/05/apdom_deluise&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, DeLuise played in the off-Broadway musical revue &quot;Another Evening with Harry Stoons&quot;, which lasted nine previews and one performance. Another member of the cast was 19-year-old Barbra Streisand. He was also in the off-Broadway play &quot;All in Love&quot;, which opened on November 10, 1961, at the Martinique Theatre and ran for 141 performances. Other New York theater performances included &quot;Half-Past Wednesday&quot; (off-Broadway) (1962); &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (off-Broadway) (1963); &quot;The Student Gypsy&quot; (Broadway) (1963); &quot;Here&#x27;s Love&quot; (Broadway) (1963); and &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (Broadway) (1969).

DeLuise generally appeared in comedic parts, although an early appearance in the movie &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; as a nervous USAF technical sergeant showed a broader range. His first acting credit was as a regular performer in the television show &quot;The Entertainers&quot; in 1964. He gained early notice for his supporting turn in the Doris Day film &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; (1966). In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby panned the film but singled out the actor, stating, &quot;[T]he best of the lot, however, is a newcomer, Dom DeLuise, as a portly, bird-brained spy.&quot;

In the 1970s and 1980s, he often co-starred with his real-life friend Burt Reynolds. Together they appeared in the films &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; and &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, &quot;The End&quot;, and &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;. DeLuise was the host of the television show &quot;Candid Camera&quot; from 1991 to 1992. He was a mainstay of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, an American television series that aired on CBS during the 1993–1994 and 1994–1995 television seasons.

DeLuise also lent his distinctive voice to various animated films and was a particular staple of Don Bluth&#x27;s features, playing major roles in &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, &quot;An American Tail&quot;, &quot;A Troll in Central Park&quot; and &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; (also with Reynolds). &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; also featured Reynolds&#x27; voice as Charlie B. Barkin while DeLuise voiced Itchy Itchiford, Charlie&#x27;s best friend, wing-man and later partner in business. Unlike DeLuise, however, Reynolds would not contribute a voiceover to any of the eventual film or television series or sequels.

DeLuise also voiced the incarnation of Charles Dickens&#x27; Fagin in the Walt Disney film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; and made voice guest appearances on several animated TV series.
TV producer Greg Garrison hired DeLuise to appear as a specialty act on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;. DeLuise ran through his &quot;Dominick the Great&quot; routine, a riotous example of a magic act gone wrong, with host Martin as a bemused volunteer from the audience. Dom&#x27;s catchphrase, with an Italian accent, was &quot;No Applause Please, Save-a to the End&quot;. The show went so well that DeLuise was soon a regular on Martin&#x27;s program, participating in both songs and sketches.

Garrison also featured DeLuise in his own hour-long comedy specials for ABC. (Martin was often off-camera when these were taped, and his distinctive laugh can be heard.)

In 1968, DeLuise hosted his own hour-long comedy variety series for CBS, &quot;The Dom DeLuise Show&quot;. Taped in Miami at The Jackie Gleason Theater, it featured many regular Gleason show cast members including The June Taylor Dancers and The Sammy Spear Orchestra. DeLuise&#x27;s wife Carol Arthur also regularly appeared. The 16-week run was the summer replacement for &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;. He later starred in his own sitcom, &quot;Lotsa Luck&quot; (1973–1974).

DeLuise was probably best known as a regular in Mel Brooks&#x27;s films. He appeared in &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot;, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, &quot;Silent Movie&quot;, &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;, &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, and &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;. Brooks&#x27; wife, actress Anne Bancroft, directed Dom in &quot;Fatso&quot; (1980).

DeLuise exhibited his comedic talents while playing the speaking part of the jailer Frosch in the comedic operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, playing the role in four separate revivals of the work at the Met between December 1989 and January 1996. In the production, while the singing was in German, the spoken parts were in English. A lifelong opera fan, he also portrayed the role of L&#x27;Opinion Publique in drag for the Los Angeles Opera&#x27;s production of Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;.

An avid cook and author of several books on cooking, he appeared as a regular contributor to a syndicated home improvement radio show, &quot;On The House with The Carey Brothers&quot;, giving listeners tips on culinary topics. He was also a friend and self-proclaimed &quot;look-alike&quot; of famous Cajun chef Paul Prudhomme and author of seven children&#x27;s books.

DeLuise also voiced the incarnation of Charles Dickens&#x27; Fagin in the Walt Disney film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; and made guest appearances on several animated TV series.

==Personal life==
In 1964, while working in a summer theater in Provincetown, Massachusetts, DeLuise met actress Carol Arthur. They married in 1965 and had three sons, all of whom became actors, writers, and directors themselves: Peter, Michael, and David DeLuise.

==Death==
DeLuise died in his sleep of kidney failure on May 4, 2009, at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, at age 75. He had had cancer for more than a year prior to his death and also had high blood pressure and diabetes.

Burt Reynolds paid tribute to DeLuise in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, saying: &quot;As you get older and start to lose people you love, you think about it more, and I was dreading this moment. Dom always made you feel better when he was around, and there will never be another like him.&quot; Mel Brooks also made a statement to the same paper, telling them that DeLuise &quot;created so much joy and laughter on the set that you couldn&#x27;t get your work done. So every time I made a movie with Dom, I would plan another two days on the schedule just for laughter. It&#x27;s a sad day. It&#x27;s hard to think of this life and this world without him.&quot;

<text>The Report on the Affairs of British North America, (, 1839) commonly known as the Durham Report or Lord Durham&#x27;s Report, is an important document in the history of Quebec, Ontario, Canada and the British Empire.

The notable British Whig politician John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, was sent to the Canadas in 1838 to investigate and report on the causes of the rebellions of 1837–38. Durham arrived in Quebec City on 29 May. He had just been appointed Governor General and given special powers as high commissioner of British North America.

On the first page of his report he stated that &quot;[w]hile the present state of things is allowed to last, the actual inhabitants of these Provinces have no security for person or property—no enjoyment of what they possess—no stimulus to industry.&quot; He would return to that theme repeatedly throughout his report.

The Report was highly controversial. In Upper Canada it was rejected by the dominant Tory elite, while out-of-power reformers welcomed the ideal of responsible government. In Lower Canada, anglophone Tories were supportive because it would enable them to remain in power. French Canadians were opposed to a union that called for &quot;obliterating [their] nationality.&quot; The &quot;Report&quot; led to major reforms and democratic advances. The two Canadas were subsequently merged into a single colony, the Province of Canada, in the 1840 &quot;Act of Union&quot;. It moved Canada slowly on the path to &quot;responsible government&quot; (that is, self-government), which took a decade. In the long run, it advanced democracy and played a central role in the evolution of Canada&#x27;s political independence from Britain.

==Inquiry==
In Upper Canada and Lower Canada, he formed numerous committees with essentially all the opponents of the Patriotes and made numerous personal observations on life in the colonies.

Durham knew how to organize support in Upper Canada. His team drew upon a long tradition of petitioning and the example of political activism in Britain. There were extensive advance publicity and public processions to attract audiences for meetings. The goal was to convince London of the widespread popular support in Canada for the report proposals. The meetings were represented as nonpartisan, respectable, loyal, orderly and deserving of parliamentary support.

Durham also visited the United States and wrote that he had assumed that he would find that the rebellions had been based on liberalism and economics. However, he eventually concluded that the real problem was the conflict between the traditionalist French and the modernizing English, and that assimilation of the French minority, through their adoption of the political institutions and the &quot;superior advantages of their English competitors&quot;, had effectively put an end to the tensions between the two communities.

According to Durham, the culture of the French Canadians had changed little in 200 years and showed no sign of the progress that British culture had made. His report contains the famous assessment that Lower Canada had &quot;two nations warring within the bosom of a single state&quot; and that the French Canadians were &quot;a people with no literature and no history&quot;.

There can hardly be conceived a nationality more destitute of all that can invigorate and elevate a people, than that which is exhibited by the descendants of the French in Lower Canada, owing to their retaining their peculiar language and manners. They are a people with no history, and no literature. ... 
[I]t is on this essentially foreign [French] literature, which is conversant about events, opinions, and habits of life, perfectly strange and unintelligible to them, that they are compelled to be dependent. ...
In these circumstances I should be indeed surprised, if the more reflecting part of the French Canadians entertained at present any hope of continuing to preserve their nationality.

== Content ==
Durham had become the Governor-General in Lower Canada in 1837 but soon submitted his resignation because of his conflict with British Parliament mostly because of his progressive nature. He believed the British Parliament should give the colonies more power by a responsible government. Lord Durham was sent back to Canada in 1838 by British Parliament and the Crown to investigate the cause behind the rebellions of both Upper and Lower Canada and propose suggestions to fix any remaining problems and lessen the chance of future rebellions.

Lord Durham found that although the rebellions of Upper and Lower Canada were over, peace and unity were yet to be found in Canada. The people living in both colonies in Canada were struggling, as the economic situation in both areas all but collapsed. Poor farming conditions that year led to reduced harvests and increased poverty for farmers. As well as increased political tension and bitterness between parties and races of people, particularly in Lower Canada. Both Canadas were in a state of distress. Durham brought along a small but highly talented staff, most notably including Charles Buller and Edward Gibbon Wakefield. The three of them collaborated to prepare and write the report. It was generally disparaged or ignored in Britain but did draw attention from some leading British intellectuals such as John Stuart Mill. Much more important was the impact on Anglophone Canada, where led by Joseph Howe, Robert Baldwin, and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine it produced dramatic reforms.

The report was entitled &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot;. It was considered controversial as it suggested radical ideas for the time, such as for the British Parliament granting the Canadas a responsible government.

The two most well-known suggestions from Lord Durham&#x27;s report were the fusion of Upper and Lower Canada, to become a single unified colony, the Province of Canada, ruled under a single legislature, and to introduce a responsible government. Durham had believed that to be inevitable because of the progressive nature of the colony&#x27;s neighbour, the United States. He believed as those ideas were already available to the people and understood, nothing less would be accepted or tolerated and so it must be embraced to satisfy the people and maintain the peace: &quot;establishing a representative government in the North American Colonies. That has been irrevocably done and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power is not to be thought of.&quot;

Durham also recommended the creation of a municipal government and a supreme court in British North America. He was interested in not only unifying Upper and Lower Canada but also including Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. He also wanted to resolve the issue of land over Prince Edward Island, but those suggestions failed to come to fruition since the Maritime Provinces were then uninterested. Those suggestions would be put into place decades later, during the Confederation of Canada.

However, Durham believed that the problems in mostly Lower Canada were not of a political nature, but rather of an ethnic one. The assimilation of French Canadians would solve this issue, and the unification of the two Canadas would provide an effective way of doing so, first by giving the union an English majority, which would rule over the French Canadian population minority and second, by reinforcing its influence every year through English emigration. [T]he strong arm of a popular legislature would compel the obedience of the refractory population; and the hopelessness of success would gradually subdue the existing animosities, and incline the French Canadian population to acquiesce in their new state of political existence.

===Racial context===
Several references to &quot;race&quot; are made in this report, referring to French Canadians or Canadiens as a one race and to the English or Anglo-Canadians as another.

It will be acknowledged by every one who has observed the progress of Anglo-Saxon colonization in America, that sooner or later the English race was sure to predominate even numerically in Lower Canada, as they predominate already, by their superior knowledge, energy, enterprise, and wealth. The error, therefore, to which the present contest must be attributed is the vain endeavour to preserve a French Canadian nationality in the midst of Anglo-American colonies and states.

And is this French Canadian nationality one which, for the good merely people of that people, we ought to strive to perpetuate, even if it were possible? I know of no national distinctions marking and continuing a more hopeless inferiority. The language, the laws, the character of the North American continent are English; and every race but the English (I apply this to all who speak the English language) appears in a condition of inferiority. It is to elevate them from that inferiority that I desire to give to the Canadians our English character.

This is because, at the time of the report, English-speakers used the word race to mean ethnicity, referring to the populations of European states as &quot;the English race&quot;, &quot;the German race&quot; etc.

== Important passages ==
&quot;The French complained of the arrogance and injustice of the English; the English accused the French of the vices of a weak and conquered people, and charged them with meanness and perfidy. The entire mistrust which the two races have thus learned to conceive of each other&#x27;s intentions, induces them to put the worst construction on the most innocent conduct; to judge every word, every act, and every intention unfairly; to attribute the most odious designs, and reject every overture of kindness or fairness, as covering secret designs of treachery and malignity.&quot;

&quot;At first sight it appears much more difficult to form an accurate idea of the state of Upper than of Lower Canada. The visible and broad line of demarcation which separates parties by the distinctive characters of race, happily has no existence in the Upper Province. The quarrel is one of an entirely English, if not British population. Like all such quarrels, it has, in fact, created, not two, but several parties; each of which has some objects in common with some one of those to which it is opposed. They differ on one point, and agree on another; the sections, which unite together one day, are strongly opposed the next; and the very party, which acts as one, against a common opponent, is in truth composed of divisions seeking utterly different or incompatible objects. It is very difficult to make out from the avowals of parties the real objects of their struggles, and still less easy is it to discover any cause of such importance as would account for its uniting any large mass of the people in an attempt to overthrow, by forcible means, the existing form of Government.&quot;

&quot;We are not now to consider the policy of establishing representative government in the North American Colonies. That has been irrevocably done; and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power, is not to be thought of. To conduct their Government harmoniously, in accordance with its established principles, is now the business of its rulers; and I know not how it is possible to secure that harmony in any other way, than by administering the Government on those principles which have been found perfectly efficacious in Great Britain. I would not impair a single prerogative of the Crown; on the contrary, I believe that the interests of the people of these Colonies require the protection of prerogatives, which have not hitherto been exercised. But the Crown must, on the other hand, submit to the necessary consequences of representative institutions; and if it has to carry on the Government in unison with a representative body, it must consent to carry it on by means of those in whom that representative body has confidence.&quot;

&quot;A plan by which it is proposed to ensure the tranquil government of Lower Canada, must include in itself the means of putting an end to the agitation of national disputes in the legislature, by settling, at once and for ever, the national character of the Province. I entertain no doubts as to the national character which must be given to Lower Canada; it must be that of the British Empire; that of the majority of the population of British America; that of the great race which must, in the lapse of no long period of time, be predominant over the whole North American Continent. Without effecting the change so rapidly or so roughly as to shock the feelings and trample on the welfare of the existing generation, it must henceforth be the first and steady purpose of the British Government to establish an English population, with English laws and language, in this Province, and to trust its government to none but a decidedly English Legislature.&quot;

==Recommendations==
Durham made two main recommendations:
* that Upper and Lower Canada be united into one province, and
* the introduction of responsible government for all colonies in British North America

The British Parliament implemented the first point immediately but not the second. Responsible government was only granted to these colonies after 1848.

===Implementation of recommendations===

The proposed merger would benefit Upper Canada as, whereas the construction of canals would to a considerable debt load, access to the fiscal surplus of former Lower Canada would allow that debt to be erased.

The newly created Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada was required to have equal representation from Canada East and Canada West, even though the population of Canada East was considerably larger. In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000. Lord Durham had not recommended this approach and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions. The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented equal representation, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government, furthering the goal of assimilating the French-speaking population.

==Reactions==
In exile in France, Louis-Joseph Papineau published the &quot;Histoire de la résistance du Canada au gouvernement anglais&quot; (History of the resistance of Canada to the English government) in the French &quot;La Revue du Progrès&quot; in May 1839. In June, it appeared in Canada in Ludger Duvernay&#x27;s &quot;La Revue canadienne&quot; as &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;insurrection du Canada en réfutation du Rapport de Lord Durham&quot; (History of the insurrection of Canada in refutation of the Report of Lord Durham). Lord Durham believed that, to eliminate the possibility of rebellions, French Canadians had to adopt British-Canadian culture and the English language.

The assertion that the so-called &quot;French&quot; Canadians had no history and no culture and that the conflict was primarily that of two ethnic groups evidently outraged Papineau. It was pointed out that many of the Patriote leaders were of British or British Canadian origin, including among others Wolfred Nelson, the hero of the Battle of Saint-Denis; Robert Nelson, author of the Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada, who would have become President of Lower Canada had the second insurrection succeeded; journalist Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan; and Thomas Storrow Brown, general during the Battle of St-Charles. It was also pointed out that an uprising had occurred in Upper Canada where there was only one &quot;race&quot;. According to Papineau and other Patriotes, the analysis of the economic situation of French Canadians was biased. Indeed, from 1791 to the rebellions, the elected representatives of Lower Canada had been demanding control over the budget of the colony.

== Impact outside Canada ==
The general conclusions of the report regarding self-governance eventually spread to various other white settler colonies, including Australia and New Zealand in the 1850s (with Western Australia receiving self-government in 1890). The parallel nature of government organization in Australia and Canada to this day is an ongoing proof of the long-enduring effects of the report&#x27;s recommendations.

The report did not see any of its recommendations come into force in the African and Asian colonies, but some limited democratic reforms in India became possible that otherwise would not have been.

==Conclusion==
Durham resigned on 9 October 1838 amid controversy excited in London by his decision of the penal questions and was soon replaced by Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham, who was responsible for implementing the Union of the Canadas. The report of Durham was laid before Parliament in London on 11 February 1839.

<text>Kata Tjuṯa (Pitjantjatjara: , lit. &#x27;many heads&#x27;; ), also known as The Olgas and officially gazetted as Kata TjutaMount Olga, is a group of large, domed rock formations or bornhardts located about southwest of Alice Springs, in the southern part of the Northern Territory, central Australia. Uluṟu / Ayers Rock, located to the east, and Kata Tjuṯa / The Olgas form the two major landmarks within the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. The park is considered sacred to the local Aboriginal community.

The 36 domes that make up Kata Tjuṯa / Mount Olga cover an area of are composed of conglomerate, a sedimentary rock consisting of cobbles and boulders of varying rock types including granite and basalt, cemented by a matrix of coarse sandstone. The highest dome, Mount Olga, is above sea level, or approximately above the surrounding plain ( higher than Uluṟu). Kata Tjuṯa is located at the eastern end of the Docker River Road.

==Name==
&quot;Kata Tjuta&quot;, in the Pitjantjatjara dialect, is the traditional Aboriginal name for the formation. The alternative name, &quot;The Olgas&quot;, comes from the tallest peak, Mount Olga. At the behest of Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, Mount Olga was named in 1872 by Ernest Giles, in honour of Queen Olga of Württemberg (born Grand Duchess Olga of Russia, daughter of Tsar Nicholas I). She and her husband, King Charles I of Württemberg, had marked their 25th wedding anniversary the previous year by, among other things, naming Mueller a &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron), making him Ferdinand &quot;von&quot; Mueller. The naming was his way of repaying the compliment.

On 15 December 1993, a dual naming policy was adopted that allowed official names consisting of both the traditional Aboriginal name and the English name. As a result, Mount Olga was renamed &quot;Mount Olga / Kata Tjuṯa&quot;. On 6 November 2002, following a request from the Regional Tourism Association, the order of the dual names was officially reversed, to &quot;Kata Tjuṯa / Mount Olga&quot;.

== Geologic origin ==
The region surrounding Kata Tjuṯa lies in the Amadeus Basin, an intracratonic basin formed during the Adelaidian, roughly 850–800  million years ago. During the Petermann Orogeny, approximately 550 million years ago, an event known as the Woodroffe Thrust lifted granulite facies rocks northward over low-grade metamorphic rocks. The eventual erosion of the formation resulted in a molasse facies, or deposition in front of rising mountains, in this case, the Petermann Orogeny, creating the deposit known as the Mount Currie Conglomerate. The Mount Currie Conglomerate is made predominantly of basalt, porphyry, granite, gneiss and volcanic rock fragments with a matrix composed of angular quartz, microcline and orthoclase among other minerals.

Both Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are made of sediment originating in this Mount Currie Conglomerate and both have a chemical composition similar to granite. Scientists using Rubidium-strontium dating techniques to date the rock accurately have given it an age of 600 million years, matching the date of the Woodroffe Thrust event. The actual fresh rock that makes up the Kata Tjuṯa / Olgas and Uluṟu / Ayers Rock is medium to dark grey with green or pink hues in some laminae. The bright orange-red hue, for which the structures are noted, is due to a patina over finely divided feldspar coated in iron oxide.

==Legends==
There are many Pitjantjatjara Dreamtime legends associated with this place and indeed everything in the vicinity including Uluṟu / Ayers Rock. A number of legends surround the great snake king Wanambi, who is said to live on the summit of Kata Tjuṯa and only comes down during the dry season. His breath was said to be able to transform a breeze into a hurricane in order to punish those who did evil deeds. The majority of mythology surrounding the site is not disclosed to outsiders, and in particular, women. As is the custom, should women become privy to the &quot;men&#x27;s business&quot;, they are susceptible to violent attacks, even death. The Anangu people believe the great rocks of Kata Tjuṯa are homes to spirit energy from the Dreaming, and since 1995 the site is being used once again for cultural ceremonies.

==Locations, access and facilities==
Kata Tjuṯa / Mount Olga can be reached via Ayers Rock Airport, followed by a drive south, then west. Visitors are required to pay an entry fee. Kata Tjuṯa is about by road from Alice Springs, via the Stuart and Lasseter highways. It is a hour drive.

Kata Tjuṯa / Mount Olga has both a sunrise and sunset viewing area, which are accessible via a short walk from Kata Tjuṯa Road. There are also two walks that enter the domes of Kata Tjuta:

* Valley of the Winds - 7.4 km / 3–4 hours (Grade 4)
* Walpa Gorge walk - 2.6 km / 1–2 hours

<doc id="546778" wikidata="Q941448" url="?curid=546778" title="Moorish idol">
<text>The Moorish idol (Zanclus cornutus) is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Zanclidae. It is the only member of the monospecific genus Zanclus and the only extant species within the Zanclidae. This species is found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region.

==Taxonomy==
The Moorish idol was first formally described as &quot;Chaetodon cornutus&quot; in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; with &quot;Indian Seas&quot; given as its type locality. In 1831 Georges Cuvier classified it in the new monospecific genus &quot;Zanclus&quot;. In 1876 Pieter Bleeker proposed the monotypic family Zanclidae. The Zanclidae is classified within the suborder Acanthuroidei of the order Acanthuriformes. Some authors classify the Moorish idols in the surgeonfish family Acanthuridae but the absence of spines on the caudal peduncle is a clear difference between this species and the surgeonfishes. 

&quot;Eozanclus brevirostris&quot; is an extinct species in the Zanclidae family that was first described by Giovanni Serafino Volta in 1796. The species later received separate taxonomic status within the Zanclidae family through the description of Blot and Voruz in 1970 and 1975. &quot;Angiolinia mirabilis&quot; is another extinct Zanclid that was described by Giorgio Carnevale and James C. Tyler in 2024 based on three specimens found in Bolca, Italy. Carnevale &amp; Tyler found that &quot;Zanclus cornutus&quot; and &quot;Angiolinia mirabilis&quot; form a derived clade distinguishable from &quot;Eozanclus brevirostris&quot; by one supernumerary spine on the first dorsal-fin pterygiophore, one in the caudal skeleton, and distally filamentous dorsal-fin spines (except the first two fins).
==Etymology==
The Moorish idol&#x27;s unusual name was apparently given to it because, in some areas of southeast Asia, fishermen have respect for these fishes, releasing them when caught and honouring them with a bow after their release. In this case, &quot;Moor&quot; is erroneously used as it usually refers to Amazigh people from Morocco where this fish does not occur in the wild, although this term may be related to the practice of referring to muslims in Sri Lanka and India as &quot;Moors&quot; during the colonial period. The genus name &quot;Zanclus&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word &quot;zanklon&quot;, meaning &quot;sickle&quot;, and is an allusion to the long curved dorsal fin. The specific name, &quot;cornutus&quot;, means &quot;horned&quot;, and refers to the small bony protuberances over the eyes.

==Description==

The Moorish idol&#x27;s body is highly laterally compressed and disc-like in shape with a tube-like snout and small bony protuberances above the eyes in adults. The mouth is small and has many long, bristle like teeth. There are no spines or serrations on the preoperculum or caudal peduncle. The dorsal fin is supported by 6 or 7 spines, which are elongated into a long filament which resembles a whip, and between 39 and 45 soft rays. The anal fin contains 3 spines and between 31 and 37 soft rays. The maximum published total length is , although is more typical. They have a white background color, with two wide black vertical bands on the body with a yellow patch on the posterior end of the body and a yellow saddle on the snout. The caudal fin is black with a white margin.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Moorish idol has a wide range in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They are found from the eastern coast of Africa between Somalia and South Africa east to Hawaii and Easter Island. They are also found in the eastern Pacific from the southern Gulf of California to Peru, including many islands such as the Galapagos and Cocos Island. The Moorish idol lives between depths of in turbid lagoons, reef flats, and clear rocky- and coral reefs. As with many reef fishes, habitat has been found to be an important and influential factor in the abundance of Moorish idols.

==Biology==
Moorish idols are omnivores, mostly feeding on sponges, with a study on gut content finding sponges make up about 70% of the total weight consumed by Moorish idols. They also feed upon algae, coral polyps, tunicates and other benthic invertebrates. They are normally found in small groups of 2 or 3 individuals but they can also be solitary or gather in large schools. 

===Reproduction===
These fish are pelagic spawners. The males and females release sperm and eggs into the water, and the eggs drift away on the current following fertilization. Like their closely related family, the Acanthuridae, the Moorish idol has larvae that are specialized for a long pelagic life stage, and this is why they are so widespread and geographically uniform. In acanthuridae, the pelagic, pre-juvenile stage larvae can reach lengths of 60 mm before settling in their habitat. The Moorish idol’s various larval stages have been described and illustrated. The larval stage refers to the stage from hatchling to the start of upward flexion of the notochord. The preflexion larval stage of the Moorish idol has no fin spines, soft rays, or internal support structures for the fins. However, in a 3.2 mm specimen there is the start of the dorsal and anal fins. The larger preflexion specimens have mostly cartilaginous crests with 23 to 26 curved dorsal spines. Also, pigmentation increases with size in the preflexion larvae. The postflexion larval stage refers to the stage that includes the formation of the caudal fin and fin rays. This is the stage right before juvenile and settlement into their habitat. In the postflexion stage, the Moorish idol larvae have fully developed fins, their body form is compressed and deep-bodied. The larvae have a small terminal mouth and kite shaped body. They have seven dorsal spines at the start of their dorsal fin that are covered in small spines. Their third dorsal spine is very long (about 1.2x their standard length). They also have one pelvic fin spine and three anal fin spines covered in small spines.

==Conservation Status== 
Since their last assessment in 2015, the Moorish idol is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN. They were found to be widely distributed and locally abundant with no major threats to the species. However, their habitat type, particularly coral reefs, are known to be in decline due to climate change. The species has been found to do well in restored coral reefs and artificial reef structures.

== In the aquarium ==

Moorish idols are notoriously difficult to maintain in captivity. They require large tanks, often exceeding , are voracious eaters, and can become destructive.

Some aquarists prefer to keep substitute species that look very similar to the Moorish idol. These substitutes are all butterflyfishes of the genus &quot;Heniochus&quot; and include the pennant coralfish, &quot;H. acuminatus&quot;; threeband pennantfish, &quot;H. chrysostomus&quot; and the false Moorish idol, &quot;H. diphreutes&quot;.

In captivity, Moorish idols typically are very picky eaters. They will either eat no food and perish, or eat everything all at once.

==In popular culture==
* In the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated movie &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, a Moorish idol fish named Gill, voiced by Willem Dafoe, is one of Nemo&#x27;s tank mates and the leader of the Tank Gang. Gill was depicted having a very strong desire for freedom outside of the aquarium and was constantly scheming to achieve this, possibly alluding to the difficulty of keeping real-life Moorish idols in captivity. Gill and the other members of the Tank Gang appeared in the 2016 sequel, &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, in a post credits scene. 
* Moorish idols have long been among the most recognizable of coral reef fauna. Their image has graced all types of products, such as: shower curtains, blankets, towels and wallpaper made with an ocean or underwater theme.

<text>The Six Divisions of Cavalry (), also known as the Kapıkulu Süvarileri (&quot;Household Slave Cavalry&quot;), was a corps of elite cavalry soldiers in the army of the Ottoman Empire (Sipahi). There were not really six, but four, divisions in the corps. Two of the six were sub-divisions. The divisions were:

* Sipāhiyān (, roughly, &quot;Armymen&quot;)
* Silah-dārān (From Persian, translated roughly as &quot;weaponbearers&quot;)
* Ulufeciyān (; translated as &quot;&quot;), organised into two sub-divisions:
** ()
* Garibān (; translated roughly as &quot;strangers&quot;), organised into two sub-divisions:
** Garips of the Left

The elite cavalry was the mounted counterpart to the Janissaries and played an important part in the Ottoman army. The Six Divisions were probably founded during the reign of Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1451–1481), but the Sipahis had existed since 1326.

<text>Lewis Thomas (November 25, 1913 – December 3, 1993) was an American physician, poet, etymologist, essayist, administrator, educator, policy advisor, and researcher.

==Life and career==
Thomas was born in Flushing, New York and attended Princeton University and Harvard Medical School. He became Dean of Yale Medical School and New York University School of Medicine, and President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute. His formative years as an independent medical researcher were at Tulane University School of Medicine.

He was invited to write regular essays in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;. One collection of those essays, &quot;The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher&quot; (1974), won annual National Book Awards in two categories, Arts and Letters and The Sciences (both awards were split).
(He also won a Christopher Award for that book.) Two other collections of essays (originally published in &quot;NEJM&quot; and elsewhere) were &quot;The Medusa and the Snail&quot; and &quot;Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony&quot;. In its first paperback edition, &quot;The Medusa and the Snail&quot; won another National Book Award in Science.

His autobiography, &quot;The Youngest Science: Notes of a Medicine Watcher&quot;, is a record of a century of medicine and the changes which occurred in it. He also published a book on etymology titled &quot;Et Cetera, Et Cetera&quot;, poems, and numerous scientific papers.

Many of his essays discuss relationships among ideas or concepts using etymology as a starting point. Others concern the cultural implications of scientific discoveries and the growing awareness of ecology. In his essay on Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot;, Thomas addresses the anxieties produced by the development of nuclear weapons. Thomas is often quoted, given his notably eclectic interests and superlative prose style.

Thomas was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1961), the United States National Academy of Sciences (1972), and the American Philosophical Society (1976). The Lewis Thomas Prize is awarded annually by The Rockefeller University to a scientist for artistic achievement.
He died in 1993 of Waldenstrom&#x27;s disease, a rare lymphoma-like cancer.

His daughter is writer Abigail Thomas.

<doc id="546808" wikidata="Q8012771" url="?curid=546808" title="William I. Rose (geologist)">
<text>William Ingersoll Rose, known as Bill Rose, is emeritus professor of petrology at Michigan Technological University. He is best known for his work in the field of volcanology and remote sensing.

==Career==
Rose was born in 1944 in Corrales, New Mexico. He studied geography and geology at Dartmouth College from 1962-1966, graduating with a BA. He remained at Dartmouth to complete a PhD under the supervision of Professor Richard Stoiber, from 1966 to 1970. He took up a faculty position at Michigan Tech in September 1970. From 1970 to 1990 he rose from Assistant Professor in Petrology to full Professor at Michigan Tech, and was appointed Research Professor in 2011. He was chair of the Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences from 1990 to 1998. Rose also spent periods as visiting scientist or visiting fellow at NCAR, USGS, Volcanological Survey of Indonesia, Cascades Volcano Observatory and Bristol University.

In his career, Rose has worked across a wide range of topics in volcanology. His early work with Stoiber included studies of the fumaroles and incrustations at steaming volcanoes across Central America. He has worked extensively on volcanic gas and ash emissions from volcanic systems, and on processes in volcanic plumes, and on the detection of ice in eruption plumes from remote sensing data. Rose spent much of his career working on the volcanoes of Central America. He established programmes and activities for training in the region, and edited several books on the topics of volcanism and hazards in that region.

During his retirement, Rose has remained active, and has developed new themes in the area of geoheritage with a particular focus on the Copper Country of the Keweenaw peninsula and Isle Royale.

==Recognition and awards==
Rose was awarded the 2002 N. L. Bowen Award of the American Geophysical Union for his contributions to geosciences, volcanology and remote sensing. In 2013, Rose was elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, in recognition of his scientific contributions and eminence in the field.

<doc id="546810" wikidata="Q16841939" url="?curid=546810" title="Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal">
<text>One of the greatest challenges facing the builders of the Panama Canal was dealing with the tropical diseases rife in the area. The health measures taken during the construction contributed greatly to the success of the canal&#x27;s construction. These included general health care, the provision of an extensive health infrastructure, and a major program to eradicate disease-carrying mosquitoes from the area.

== Background ==

===US control===
By the time the United States took control of the Panama Canal project on May 4, 1904, the Isthmus of Panama was notorious for tropical diseases. An estimated 12,000 workers had died during the construction of the Panama Railway and over 22,000 during the French effort to build a canal. 

The high rate of deaths among workers on the Panama Canal due to disease was the source of a great deal of controversy in the United States. Newspapers, such as &quot;The Independent&quot;, frequently reported on the poor conditions workers in the Canal Zone experienced, including the rampant disease. Poultney Bigelow wrote an article in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1906 critiquing the work on the Panama Canal, which was highly influential with the American public. Among other topics, Bigelow brought attention to the poor living conditions of the workers, including pools of standing water where mosquitoes could breed and spread disease from.

It was clear to organizers of the American effort that previous disease control efforts had been largely ineffective. Traditionally, yellow fever had been thought to be caused by contact with filth and malaria by noxious vapors. However, between 1897 and 1902, both diseases were shown to be spread by mosquitoes, following research by Cuban epidemiologist Carlos Finlay, American pathologist Walter Reed and Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross.

== The Sanitation effort ==
The Canal Commission appointed Colonel William Crawford Gorgas in March 1904 as head of hospitals and sanitation. Under his leadership, many new departments of sanitation were founded, covering different aspects of the sanitation problem. Commissions were also formed to look after the basic welfare of laborers.

 The sanitation work included clearing land and establishing quarantine facilities. The most ambitious part of the sanitation program, though, was undoubtedly the effort to eradicate the mosquitoes &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; and &quot;Anopheles&quot;, the carriers of yellow fever and malaria, respectively, from the canal zone. There was initially considerable resistance to this program, as the &quot;mosquito theory&quot; was still considered controversial and unproven. However, with the support of chief engineer John Frank Stevens, who took over the post on July 26, 1905, Gorgas was finally able to put his ideas into action.

Gorgas divided Panama into 11 districts, and Colón, Panama, into four. In each district, inspectors searched houses and buildings for mosquito larvae. If larvae were found, carpenters were dispatched to the building, and work was done to eliminate objects or places where stagnant water could collect.

Mosquitoes lay their eggs on the surface of standing water, and when the larvae hatch, they live just below the surface, breathing through a siphon in their tails. Therefore, by eliminating standing water where possible and by spreading oil on the surface of any remaining pools, the larvae could be destroyed.

Gorgas also had domestic water systems installed in urban areas around the Canal Zone. These systems eliminated the need for rainwater collection, which had been collected in barrels and was a place for mosquitoes to breed. The United States government also provided $20 million to give workers free medical care and burial services. Gorgas&#x27;s sanitation department also provided about one ton of prophylactic quinine each year to people in the Canal Zone to combat malaria.

Gorgas organized a major program to drain and fill swamps and wetlands around the Canal Zone. Many miles of ditches were dug, and grass and brush were cut back over wide areas. Oiling was used in a variety of means: workers with spray tanks were sent to spray oil on standing pools, and smaller streams were tackled by placing a dripping oil can over the waterway, which created a film of oil over each still patch of water in the stream. About 700,000 gallons of oil and 124,000 gallons of larvicide were used on the project. Gorgas also took another step in his efforts to eradicate mosquitoes in Panama: fumigation. He fumigated the residences of Panamanians who had been confirmed to have contracted yellow fever. &quot;Pans of sulfur or pyrethrum were then placed in the rooms, the right quantity of powder was weighed out (two pounds per thousand cubic feet), and the pans were sprinkled with wood-alcohol and set alight&quot; (Cameron 132). When the effectiveness of this procedure was realized, fumigation was extended to all of Panama. Within a year of Stevens&#x27;s appointment, every building in Panama had been fumigated, using up the entire US supply of sulfur and pyrethrum. In 1906, only one case of yellow fever was reported, and by the end of the Panama Canal&#x27;s construction, there were zero every year.

Gorgas&#x27;s final means of attack on disease was to quarantine individuals infected with yellow fever or malaria from the rest of the workforce. Those who were diagnosed with either disease were put into &quot;Portable Fever Cages&quot;, easily transportable screened structures used to prevent mosquitoes from biting an infected person and carrying the disease to others. Gorgas also had the thousands of canal workers sleep in screened verandas, as the mosquitoes that spread malaria are nocturnal and would infect the most people at night.

== Outcome ==
The first two and a half years of the American canal effort were substantially dedicated to preparation, much of it making the area fit for large-scale human habitation. A significant part of this was the sanitation program put in place by Gorgas. Nearly $20 million was spent on health and sanitation during the ten years.

Gorgas continuously faced opposition because of the cost- and manpower-intensive nature of the eradication work, as well as entrenched ideas that mosquitoes were irrelevant to disease spread. At one stage, Theodore P. Shonts, head of the commission responsible for the canal, requested U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to remove Gorgas from the project because of his costly obsession with mosquitoes. Roosevelt asked advice from two leading physicians in the U.S. He was told that he had a choice between Shonts and Gorgas, and that he would get his canal if he supported Gorgas. Thereafter, Roosevelt gave Gorgas his full backing.

In the end, these efforts were a success: by 1906, yellow fever was virtually wiped out in the Canal Zone, and the number of deaths caused by the other tropical disease, malaria, was also reduced significantly. The hospitals maintained were by far the best to be found anywhere in the tropics; some 32,000 patients were treated per year.

While disease reduction dramatically improved the health of white workers, black workers—the majority of the canal workforce—continued to die in large numbers, at ten times the rate of white workers in 1906. While medical care was provided to all, housing was not provided to workers, many of whom had to live in tents and tenements outside the mosquito-controlled zone. In the end, 350 white workers and 4,500 black workers had died. While the loss was tragic, it was far less than during the French era.

Today, the Panama canal area is regarded as free of yellow fever and malaria.

<text>Goodwin Jess &quot;Goodie&quot; Knight (December 9, 1896 – May 22, 1970) was an American politician and judge who served as the 31st governor of California from 1953 to 1959. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 35th lieutenant governor of California from 1947 to 1953 under Governor Earl Warren.

Knight was born in Utah and moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was a child. He followed a career in law and politics, becoming a Superior Court judge before moving into politics. He was elected lieutenant governor of California in 1946, serving under Governor Earl Warren. Upon Warren&#x27;s appointment as Chief Justice of the United States by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Knight assumed the governorship before being elected in his own right in 1954. His tenure as governor was marked by conflicts within his party. He chose not to run for a second full term as governor in 1958 and made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. He attempted to make a return to the governorship in 1962, but withdrew from the race. 

Knight was married twice and had two daughters. He died in 1970, shortly after the suicide of his daughter. His funeral was attended by high-profile individuals including then-California Governor Ronald Reagan and U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Knight was born in Provo, Utah, but his family moved to Los Angeles when he was a boy. His father, Jesse Jasper Knight (nephew of mining magnate Jesse Knight), was a mining engineer, but Goodwin followed in the footsteps of his maternal grandfather, John B. Milner, who was a judge in Provo.

Knight attended high school in Los Angeles, at Manual Arts High School. One of his classmates was Jimmy Doolittle. He earned an A.B. in Law and Business from Stanford University, where he was a staff member of the &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot; in 1919. Knight also attended Cornell University. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War I.

===Career===
Knight was a judge of the Superior Court in Los Angeles beginning in 1935. He was reelected in 1936 and 1942 without significant opposition. His case load varied from the glamorous to the mundane. He oversaw weddings and divorces for Hollywood starlets.

===Political career and Governor of California===
Knight began his political career in 1944, when he pursued the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate. He bowed out early, though, to back Fred Houser. He was elected as the 35th Lieutenant Governor of California to serve under Governor Earl Warren in 1946, then reelected in 1950. He became governor himself when Warren resigned to become Chief Justice of the United States in 1953.

While Lieutenant Governor, he made a guest appearance on Jack Benny&#x27;s radio show which aired on May 10, 1953, an episode from San Francisco. He appeared on Benny&#x27;s TV show four years later, on February 10, 1957.

As governor, Knight fought for control of the Republican Party of California with U.S. Senate Majority Leader William Knowland and Vice President Richard Nixon. In 1954, Knight was easily elected to his own full term. At first Knight seemed to make an alliance with Knowland, but this began to sour in 1956 when Knowland supported Nixon for renomination as vice president. In 1957, Knowland announced that he would challenge Knight in the 1958 Republican primary for governor. Knight, known as a moderate, and sympathetic to organized labor, faced a serious threat from more conservative challengers. In November 1957, induced by Norman Chandler (GOP-friendly publisher of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;), old enemy Nixon and President Dwight Eisenhower (among others), Knight announced he would run for Knowland&#x27;s Senate seat instead of running for governor again as a way to prevent a tough fight between two California Republicans in a political race. Both Knowland and Knight went down in defeat in 1958, with Knowland losing the gubernatorial race to Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown, Sr. and Knight losing the Senate race by over 10% to Clair Engle, severely weakening the heretofore-dominant Republicans in the state. This left Nixon in control of the California party and in line for the presidential nomination, which Knowland and Knight had also desired.

Knight was present at the July 17, 1955, opening of Disneyland, and gave a speech following Walt Disney&#x27;s famous dedication.

In September 1961, Knight announced a bid for a return to the governorship. He later dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination which was won by Nixon, who was in turn defeated by Brown.

In 1964, Knight endorsed Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican nomination against Barry Goldwater. Rockefeller was unsuccessful in stopping Goldwater, the darling of the party&#x27;s growing conservative wing. Knight never ran for political office again.

===Personal life===
Knight&#x27;s first wife, Arvilla, died of a heart attack on October 29, 1952; the couple had two daughters. He married Virginia Carlson (born Virginia Piegrue on October 12, 1918, in Fort Dodge, Iowa), the widow of an Army lieutenant, on August 2, 1954, at the Episcopal Church of Our Savior in Los Angeles. The couple had no children.

===Death===
On May 22, 1970, Knight died three months after his 36-year-old daughter Carolyn Knight Weedman committed suicide. She took her life by carbon monoxide asphyxiation from her car in the garage of her home in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles and left behind two sons, Jonathan and Robert Weedman. Knight discovered his daughter a day later, and this is believed to have contributed to the stroke that ultimately ended his life. His widow, Virginia, never remarried; she died at age 92 on November 29, 2010.

Goodwin Knight&#x27;s funeral took place in Saint James Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, with full military honors. The funeral was attended by then California Governor Ronald Reagan, U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona, accompanied by his son, U.S. Representative Barry Goldwater Jr. from California, General of the Army Omar Bradley and numerous Hollywood and civic leaders. Knight was initially interred at Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, but one year later disinterred and his remains moved to Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California after his second wife, Virginia Knight, learned he had purchased a crypt next to his first wife, Arvilla.

Throughout the 1980s, he was part of the &quot;Three Dragons&quot; along with Chan and Hung; the three starred in six Hong Kong films together. Yuen Biao has appeared in over 130 films. He has played roles in eight television series for the Hong Kong channel TVB.

==Early life==
Born Ha Lingchun () in Nanjing, China on the 26th July 1957, he was the fifth child in a family of eight children. He and his family moved to Hong Kong when he was five years old. At the age of six he was enrolled at the Peking Opera School &quot;The China Drama Academy&quot;. He was given the stage name Yuen Biao (Little Tiger) and trained alongside schoolmates Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Corey Yuen, Yuen Wah and several others, under master Yu Jim-yuen, who would later become famous in Hong Kong cinema. He quickly showed a talent for acrobatics. According to Jackie Chan&#x27;s autobiography, when Yuen was asked by his master to do a backflip on his first day of training, Yuen did a proper backflip on his very first try. He remained at the school until the age of 16. When he left, Yuen followed his classmate Sammo Hung into a career in the Hong Kong film industry.

==Film career==
===Early 1970s===
In the early 1970s, Yuen began work as a stuntman and extra. After working on &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; and &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot;. He was also one of the &quot;fake&quot; Bruce Lees in &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1978), performing the acrobatics and stunts that the Bruce Lee &quot;body double&quot; (taekwondo expert Kim Tai-chung) was unable to perform. Yuen continued working as a stuntman, doubling for actors in Hong Kong action films and taking on supporting actor roles.

During his early acting period, he adopted the anglicised name Bill Yuen for use on the Hong Kong films that were released internationally. However, recognising the growing success of Jackie Chan, Golden Harvest were keen to give him a similar name, and on some international film prints, he was credited as Jimmy Yuen. Both anglicised names were later dropped.

===Late 1970s and 1980s===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, thanks to his good friends and former classmates, Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan, he began working more frequently as an actor. After his co-starring role in &quot;The Dragon, the Odds&quot; (1977) and his full lead role debut in &quot;Knockabout&quot; (1979), he starred in several films in the early 1980s, notably &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1981) (directed by Sammo Hung) and &quot;Dreadnaught&quot; (1981) (directed by Yuen Woo-ping). He later co-starred alongside his Peking Opera &quot;brothers&quot;, Chan and Hung, in &quot;Project A&quot; (1983), &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984) and &quot;Dragons Forever&quot; (1988), and also appeared in smaller roles in films such as Hung&#x27;s original &quot;Lucky Stars&quot; trilogy. He co-starred with Sammo in films such as &quot;Eastern Condors&quot; (1987) and &quot;Millionaires Express&quot; (1988). He played the lead with Cynthia Rothrock in &quot;Righting Wrongs&quot; (1986) and alongside Maggie Cheung in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (1989).

===1990s===
Yuen&#x27;s acting roles waned somewhat in the early 1990s, although he notably played a supporting role alongside Jet Li in &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; (1991). Yuen did not appear in the sequel as he was replaced by Max Mok. In the late 1990s, films such as &quot;Hero&quot; (1997) co-starring Takeshi Kaneshiro and &quot;A Man Called Hero&quot; (1999) co-starring Ekin Cheng saw Yuen return to the big screen. During this time he began to concentrate more on television work and took lead roles in the series &quot;Righteous Guards&quot; and &quot;The Legend of a Chinese Hero&quot; in 1998.

===2000s===
In 2000, Yuen went to the United States to work with Jackie Chan as the action choreographer on &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;. In 2001, he co-starred alongside Hung in &quot;The Avenging Fist&quot;. Yuen also starred in a more comedic role in the 2002 Japan HK film &quot;No Problem 2&quot;.

In 2005, Yuen starred in a TVB series called &quot;Real Kung Fu&quot; with Yuen Wah, Maggie Siu, Leung Kar Yan, Jack Wu and one of Sammo Hung&#x27;s real life sons, Timmy Hung.

In 2006, Yuen played Inspector Steve Mok in &quot;Robin B Hood&quot; along with his long-time friend Jackie Chan.

In 2007 he finished filming the &quot;Wing Chun&quot; TV series (a remake of the 1994 series that had preceded the film &quot;Wing Chun&quot;) alongside Nicholas Tse, Sammo Hung and another of Hung&#x27;s sons, Sammy Hung. Biao plays an elder version of the character Leung Jan, the role he played 25 years earlier in &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, and father to Tse&#x27;s character.
The series has since been re-edited for release as a film, entitled &quot;Shuang Long Ji&quot; (aka &quot;Legend of Twins Dragon&quot;). However, the film&#x27;s release has been delayed as it has been banned in mainland China for containing too much violence.

Yuen appeared as a guest judge on the China Beijing TV Station reality television series &quot;The Disciple&quot;, which aired in mainland China, and was produced by and featured Jackie Chan. The aim of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan&#x27;s &quot;successor&quot;, the champion being awarded the lead role in a film. It concluded on June 7, 2008, with the series winner being announced in Beijing.

Yuen also starred alongside Bryan Leung and Ji Chunhua in &quot;Legend of Shaolin Kung-fu II: Thirteen Cudgel Monks&quot;, a series directed by Yuen Bun. It was edited down and released as &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; in the United States.

==Directing and producing==
Though mainly known as an actor, Yuen also directed the film &quot;A Kid from Tibet&quot; (1991).

Yuen set up his own film production company, Yuen Biao Films Limited, which produced his films &quot;A Kid from Tibet&quot; and &quot;Kick Boxer&quot;, also known as &quot;Once Upon a Chinese Hero&quot; (1993).

==Personal life==
In 1984, Yuen married Didi Pang Sau Ha. They have two children: daughter Yi-Bui, born in 1986, and son Ming-Tsak, born in 1988.

Yuen has a second home in Canada, where he enjoys golf.

<doc id="546826" wikidata="Q1052110" url="?curid=546826" title="County Coleraine">
<text>County Coleraine, called the County of Colerain in the earliest documents, was one of the counties of Ireland from 1585 to 1613. It was named after its intended county town, Coleraine. It was later subsumed into County Londonderry along with a big part of the once larger County Tyrone and small territories from County Donegal and County Antrim.

==Foundation and extent==

Sir John Perrot, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, established County Coleraine between the Rivers Bann and Foyle in 1585 during the reign of Elizabeth I. Sir John intended administering the new county from the town of Coleraine. In the event, the English authorities built the courthouse and jail for the new establishment at Desertmartin in the adjacent county of Tyrone. Sir Thomas Phillips was appointed Governor of the County of Coleraine in 1611.

==Towards a new county==

English control of the territory remained nominal until after the Nine Years&#x27; War. Following the Flight of the Earls (1607) and O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion (1608), the lands the Irish aristocrats held were escheated to the Crown. In 1609 the territory was given to the City of London Corporation and its livery companies, who received instructions to undertake its plantation.

The area for planting included:

* the entirety of County Coleraine
* the barony of Loughinsholin which comprised the then north of County Tyrone and the environs of Coleraine in County Antrim, together called O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Country
* a small area of County Donegal around Lough Foyle

In 1613, this larger area became incorporated into the newly founded County Londonderry, named after the titular new city, although its county town was Coleraine.

<doc id="546836" wikidata="Q416351" url="?curid=546836" title="Tissue-type plasminogen activator">
<text>Tissue-type plasminogen activator, short name tPA, is a protein that facilitates the breakdown of blood clots. It acts as an enzyme to convert plasminogen into its active form plasmin, the major enzyme responsible for clot breakdown. It is a serine protease () found on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. Human tPA is encoded by the &quot;PLAT&quot; gene, and has a molecular weight of ~70 kDa in the single-chain form.

tPA can be manufactured using recombinant biotechnology techniques, producing types of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) such as alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. These drugs are used in clinical medicine to treat embolic or thrombotic stroke, but they are contraindicated and dangerous in cases of hemorrhagic stroke and head trauma. The antidote for tPA in case of toxicity is aminocaproic acid.

== Medical uses ==
tPA is used in some cases of diseases that feature blood clots, such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke, in a medical treatment called thrombolysis. The most common use is for ischemic stroke. It can either be administered systemically, in the case of acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and most cases of acute massive pulmonary embolism, or administered through an arterial catheter directly to the site of occlusion in the case of peripheral arterial thrombi and thrombi in the proximal deep veins of the leg.

=== Ischemic stroke ===

==== Statistics ====
There have been 12 large scale, high-quality trials of rtPA in acute ischemic stroke. A meta-analysis of these trials concluded that rtPA given within 6 hours of a stroke significantly increased the odds of being alive and independent at final follow-up, particularly in patients treated within 3 hours. However a significant mortality rate was noted, mostly from intracranial haemorrhage at 7 days, but later mortality was not significant amongst treated and non-treated patients.

It has been suggested that if tPA is effective in ischemic stroke, it must be administered as early as possible after the onset of stroke symptoms, given that patients present to an ED in a timely manner. Many national guidelines including the AHA have interpreted this cohort of studies as suggesting that there are specific subgroups who may benefit from tPA and thus recommend its use within a limited time window after the event. Protocol guidelines require its use intravenously within the first three hours of the event, after which its detriments may outweigh its benefits.

For example, the Canadian Stroke Network guideline states &quot;All patients with &quot;disabling&quot; acute ischemic stroke who can be treated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset should be evaluated without delay to determine their eligibility for treatment&quot; with tPA. Delayed presentation to the ED leads to decreased eligibility; as few as 3% of people qualify for this treatment. Similarly in the United States, the window of administration used to be 3 hours from onset of symptoms, but the newer guidelines also recommend use up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset, depending on the patient&#x27;s presentation, past medical history, current comorbidities and medication usage. tPA appears to show benefit not only for large artery occlusions but also for lacunar strokes. Since tPA dissolves blood clots, there is risk of hemorrhage with its use.

==== Administration criteria ====
Use of tPA in the United States in treatment of patients who are eligible for its use, have no contraindications, and arrival at the treating facility less than 3 hours after onset of symptoms, is reported to have doubled from 2003 to 2011. Use on patients with mild deficits, of nonwhite race/ethnicity, and oldest old age increased. However, many patients who were eligible for treatment were not treated.

tPA has also been given to patients with acute ischemic stroke above age 90 years old. Although a small fraction of patients 90 years and above treated with tPA for acute ischemic stroke recover, most patients have a poor 30-day functional outcome or die. Nonagenarians may do as well as octogenarians following treatment with IV-tPA for acute ischemic stroke. In addition, people with frostbite treated with tPA had fewer amputations than those not treated with tPA.

==== General consensus on use ====
There is consensus amongst stroke specialists that tPA is the standard of care for eligible stroke patients, and benefits outweigh the risks. There is significant debate mainly in the emergency medicine community regarding recombinant tPA&#x27;s effectiveness in ischemic stroke. The NNT Group on evidence-based medicine concluded that it was inappropriate to combine these twelve trials into a single analysis, because of substantial clinical heterogeneity (i.e., variations in study design, setting, and population characteristics). Examining each study individually, the NNT group noted that two of these studies showed benefit to patients given tPA (and that, using analytical methods that they think flawed); four studies showed harm and had to be stopped before completion; and the remaining studies showed neither benefit nor harm. On the basis of this evidence, the NNT Group recommended against the use of tPA in acute ischaemic stroke. The NNT Group notes that the case for the 3-hour time window arises largely from analysis of two trials: NINDS-2 and subgroup results from IST-3. &quot;However, presuming that early (0-3h) administration is better than later administration (3-4.5h or 4.5-6h) the subgroup results of IST-3 suggest an implausible biological effect in which early administration is beneficial, 3-4.5h administration is harmful, and 4.5-6h administration is again beneficial.&quot; Indeed, even the original publication of the IST-3 trial found that time-window effects were not significant predictors of outcome (p=0.61). In the UK, concerns by stroke specialists have led to a review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

=== Pulmonary embolism===
Pulmonary embolism (blood clots that have moved to the lung arteries) is usually treated with heparin generally followed by warfarin. If pulmonary embolism causes severe instability due to high pressure on the heart (&quot;massive PE&quot;) and leads to low blood pressure, recombinant tPA is recommended.

=== Recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (r-tPA) ===
tPA was first produced by recombinant DNA techniques at Genentech in 1982.

Tissue-type plasminogen activators were initially identified and isolated from mammalian tissues after which a cDNA library was established with the use of reverse transcriptase and mRNA from human melanoma cells. The aforementioned mRNA was isolated using antibody based immunoprecipitation. The resulting cDNA library was subsequently screened via sequence analysis and compared to a whole genome library for confirmation of specific protein isolation and accuracy. cDNA was cloned into a synthetic plasmid and initially expressed in &quot;E. coli&quot; cells, followed by yeast cells with successful results confirmed via sequencing before attempting in mammalian cells. The transformants were selected with the use of methotrexate. Methotrexate strengthens selection by inhibiting DHFR activity which then compels the cells to express more DHFR (exogenous) and consequently more recombinant protein to survive. The highly active transformants were subsequently placed in an industrial fermenter. The tPA which was then secreted into the culture medium was isolated and collected for therapeutic use. For pharmaceutical purposes, tPA was the first pharmaceutical drug produced synthetically with the use of mammalian cells, specifically Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO). Recombinant tPA is commonly referred to as r-tPA and sold under multiple brand names. 
== Interactions ==

Tissue plasminogen activator has been shown to interact with:

* Fibrinogen alpha chain
* LRP1
* SERPINI1
== Function ==

tPA and plasmin are the key enzymes of the fibrinolytic pathway in which tPA-mediated plasmin generation occurs.

tPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen at its Arg561 - Val562 peptide bond, into the serine protease plasmin.

Increased enzymatic activity causes hyperfibrinolysis, which manifests as excessive bleeding and/or an increase of the vascular permeability. Decreased activity leads to , which can result in thrombosis or embolism.

In patients with ischemic strokes, decreased tPA activity was reported to be associated with an increase in plasma P-selectin concentration.

Tissue plasminogen activator also plays a role in cell migration and tissue remodeling.

=== Physiology and regulation ===
Once in the body, tPA has can cause the desired thrombolytic activity (see figure), or be inactivated and removed. In the bloodstream tPA has a half-life of 4 to 6 minutes. tPA can be bound by a plasminogen activator inhibitor, resulting in inactivation of its activity. The protein is then removed from the bloodstream by the liver. One of the specific receptors responsible for this processes is a protein known as the LDL Receptor-Related Protein (LRP1), which clears tPA which is bound to the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). However, when present in a high enough concentration to counteract the effects of plasminogen activator inhibitor, tPA can bind plasminogen, cleaving off the bound plasmin from it. Plasmin, another type of protease, can either be bound by a plasmin inhibitor, or work to degrade fibrin clots, which is the main therapeutic pathway.

=== Synaptic plasticity ===
tPA is known to participate in some forms of synaptic plasticity, in particular long-term depression and consequently mediate some aspects of memory.

== Genetics ==

Tissue plasminogen activator is a protein encoded by the &quot;PLAT&quot; gene, which is located on chromosome 8. The primary transcript produced by this gene undergoes alternative splicing, producing three distinct messenger RNAs.

<text>The Atlantis Massif is a prominent undersea massif in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is a dome-shaped region approximately across and rising about from the sea floor. It is located at approximately 30°8′N latitude 42°8′W longitude; just east of the intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with the Atlantis Transform Fault. The highest point of the massif is around beneath the surface.

== Description ==
It is believed that the massif was formed underneath the nearby Mid-Atlantic Ridge but was pulled from under the ridge during the movement of the plates, about 1.5 to 2 million years ago. Geologic studies of the massif have indicated that it is not composed of the black basalt typical of the ocean floor but rather of dense green peridotite, which is usually found in the mantle. The central dome is corrugated and striated in a way that is representative of an exposed ultramafic oceanic core complex.

An expedition to the area in 1996 made an important advance in the study of the ocean floor. It found that a steeply sloping detachment fault is associated with the oceanic core complex structure. The dome was caused by mantle material being extruded to the surface. Another expedition discovered the Lost City hydrothermal field near the summit of the ridge in 2000.

Another expedition in 2016, the IODP 357 expedition, targeted this massif, drilling cores.

<doc id="546842" wikidata="Q2743461" url="?curid=546842" title="Nicetas of Remesiana">
<text>Nicetas (c. 335–414) was Bishop of Remesiana (present-day Bela Palanka, Serbia), which was then in the Roman province of Dacia Mediterranea.

==Biography==
Nicetas promoted Latin sacred music for use during the Eucharistic worship and reputedly composed a number of liturgical hymns. Though some nineteenth and twentieth-century scholars number the major Latin Christian hymn of praise, the &quot;Te Deum,&quot; to Nicetas (traditionally attributed to Ambrose and Augustine) this is now considered &quot;controversial&quot;. He is presumed to be the missionary to the barbarian Thracian tribe of the Bessi.

Because of his missionary activity, his contemporary and friend, Paulinus of Nola, lauded him poetically for instructing in the Gospel barbarians changed by him from wolves to sheep and brought into the fold of peace, and for teaching to sing of Christ with Roman heart bandits, who previously had no such ability. However, it is doubtful whether these barbarians really were barbarians, or whether their mention is only a poetical topos. Indeed, Paulinus, who wrote a quite classical Latin poetry, probably used existing poetical authorities. For Dacia, where Nicetas was from, the poetical authority was Ovid, although the Dacia (probably the province Dacia Mediterranea) of that time did not correspond with the Getia where Ovid had been banished to.

In 398, Nicetas made a pilgrimage to Nola to visit the grave of Felix of Nola.

Lengthy excerpts survive of his principal doctrinal work, &quot;Instructions for Candidates for Baptism&quot;, in six books. They show that he stressed the orthodox position in trinitarian doctrine. They contain the expression &quot;communion of saints&quot; about the belief in a mystical bond uniting both the living and the dead in a certain hope and love. No evidence survives of previous use of this expression, which has since played a central role in formulations of the Christian creed.

His feast day as a saint is on 22 June.

<text>Alfred Reed (born as Alfred Friedman) (January 25, 1921 – September 17, 2005) was an American neoclassical composer, with more than two hundred published works for concert band, orchestra, chorus, and chamber ensemble to his name. He also traveled extensively as a guest conductor (most notably for the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra after the retirement of Frederick Fennell) and served as a professor at the University of Miami School of Music.

==Life==
Alfred Freidman was born on January 25, 1921, in Manhattan, New York City, to Austrian immigrants Carl Friedemann von Mark and Elizabeth Strasser. Because of anti-German sentiment during World War I, Carl changed the family surname to Friedman shortly before having Alfred. Alfred began his formal music training at the age of ten studying cornet at the New York Schools of Music. In 1938, he started working in the Radio Workshop in New York as a staff arranger and assistant conductor. 

In the early 1930s, Reed hired an agent to help market himself around the New York circles. The agent suggested changing his original surname to something less Jewish- and German-sounding to help avoid discrimination. The agent took a syllable from &quot;Friedman&quot;, shortening it to &quot;Reed&quot;. Reed used this surname for the remainder of his life, legally changing it in 1955. 

In 1944 during World War II, he enlisted with the 529th US Army Air Force Corps in Atlantic City, New Jersey as their radio production director and associate conductor producing over 150 weekly broadcasts, and writing scores for over 100 original compositions and arrangements. Following his military service, he attended the Juilliard School of Music, studying under Vittorio Giannini but left without completing in 1948 to instead pursue a career composing music for film and television as a staff composer and arranger first for NBC and then for ABC. 

In 1953, he became the conductor of the Baylor Symphony Orchestra at Baylor University, where he received his Bachelor of Music in 1955 and his Master of Music in 1956. His master&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra&quot;, was awarded the Luria Prize in 1959.

From 1955 to 1966, he was the executive editor of Hansen Publications, a music publisher. Afterward, he was appointed professor of music at the University of Miami School of Music, where he worked with composer Clifton Williams from 1966 until the latter died in 1976. Reed was the director of the Music Industry Program at the time of his retirement in 1993. During his tenure, he established the Bachelor of Music and Music Merchandising (B.M.M.M) degree and the first college-level music business curriculum in the country.

<text>Mark Evgenievich Taimanov (; 7 February 1926 – 28 November 2016) was one of the leading Soviet and Russian chess players, among the world&#x27;s top 20 players from 1946 to 1971. A prolific chess author, Taimanov was awarded the title of Grandmaster in 1952 and in 1956 won the USSR Chess Championship. He was a World Championship Candidate in 1953 and 1971, and several opening variations are named after him.
Taimanov was also a world-class concert pianist.

==Early life==
Taimanov was born in Kharkov (now Kharkiv, Ukraine), where his parents studied at the time. They moved to Leningrad when he was six months old. His father Evgeny Zakharovich Taimanov was Jewish; his family escaped to Kharkiv from Smolensk during World War I. Evgeny was a student at the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute and later made a career as a head engineer at the Kirov Plant and the Hydraulic Plant, but left it to work as an engineer at the Leningrad Conservatory and various Leningrad theaters after his brother and his wife&#x27;s relatives were imprisoned in 1937.

Taimanov&#x27;s mother Serafima Ivanovna Ilyina came from an Orthodox Russian family; she studied at the Kharkiv National Kotlyarevsky University of Arts. As a piano teacher she later introduced her son to music. Mark was the eldest of three children. When he was ten, he performed as a young violinist in the Soviet children&#x27;s film &quot;Beethoven Concerto&quot; that was released in 1936. To practice for his role Taimanov studied the violin for a year. Many years later when on tour, Isaac Stern met Taimanov and complimented his violin playing in the movie, saying that all the young actors &quot;didn&#x27;t even know how to hold the violin properly. Only once I saw a violinist who did it, in the film Beethoven Concert&quot;. During the Great Patriotic War he and his father evacuated to Tashkent shortly before the Siege of Leningrad started; his mother along with his two siblings decided to stay in the city and had to survive the siege up till their evacuation in March 1942.

==Chess career==
He was awarded the International Master title in 1950, and the International Grandmaster title in 1952 by FIDE. He played in the Candidates Tournament in Zürich in 1953, where he tied for eighth place. He was regularly in the world&#x27;s top 20 players for over 25 years.

===Soviet team play===
He represented Leningrad in internal Soviet regional team competitions, scoring (+36−24=56) in 116 games, across 15 events, between 1948 and 1983. He represented the sports society &quot;Burevestnik&quot; (Students) in internal Soviet club team competitions.

===Soviet championships===
He played in 23 USSR Chess Championships (a record equalled by Efim Geller), tying for first place twice. In 1952 he lost the playoff match to Mikhail Botvinnik, who was World Champion at the time. In 1956, after finishing equal with Yuri Averbakh and Boris Spassky in the tournament proper, he won a match-tournament ahead of them, for the title.

===Loss to Fischer===
Taimanov lost to Bobby Fischer in the 1971 Candidates quarterfinal by the unprecedented score of 6–0. About this match, Taimanov later recalled that Fischer &quot;was an incredibly tough defender&quot; and that &quot;the third game proved to be the turning point of the match&quot;. After his loss to Fischer, the Soviet government was embarrassed, and, as Taimanov later put it in a 2002 interview, found it &quot;unthinkable&quot; that he could have lost the match so badly to an American without a &quot;political explanation&quot;. Soviet officials took away Taimanov&#x27;s salary and no longer allowed him to travel overseas. The official reason given for punishing Taimanov was that he had brought a book by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn into the country, but that explanation was merely a bureaucratic pretext. The officials later &quot;forgave&quot; Taimanov, and lifted the sanctions against him. Fischer&#x27;s overwhelming match wins later in 1971, first by 6–0 against Bent Larsen, then by 6½–2½ against Tigran Petrosian, may have helped contribute to their change of mind. Taimanov considered this match &quot;the culminating point&quot; of his chess career and later wrote a book about the match, titled &quot;How I Became Fischer&#x27;s Victim&quot;.

===Other tournaments===
In 2001 he came second, a half point behind the winner Jacob Murey, at the first European Senior Chess Championship in Saint-Vincent.

===International teams===
Taimanov represented the USSR in international team play with enormous success. At the 1956 Chess Olympiad in Moscow, as first reserve he scored (+6−0=5), winning team gold and board bronze medals. This was his only Olympiad appearance.

Taimanov represented the USSR four times in the European Team Chess Championship. At Vienna 1957, he played board seven, scored (+2−0=3), winning team and board gold medals. At Oberhausen 1961, he played board eight, scored (+6−0=3), and won team and board gold medals. 
At Hamburg 1965, he played board seven, scored (+3−1=4), and won team and board gold medals. At Kapfenberg 1970, he played board six, scored (+4−0=2), and won team and board gold medals.

In the inaugural Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World team match, Belgrade 1970, he played board seven, and scored (+2−1=1) against Wolfgang Uhlmann.

===Chess legacy===
Taimanov was one of the few players to have beaten six world champions (Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, and Anatoly Karpov). Opening variations are named after Taimanov in the Sicilian Defence, Modern Benoni and Nimzo-Indian Defence. He wrote books on two of his named variations, as well as an autobiographical best games collection. Taimanov&#x27;s favorite chess players were Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Tal, and Garry Kasparov.

===Major chess writings===
Note that several of Taimanov&#x27;s books are available in Russian, German, and English.

==Music career==
Taimanov was a top concert pianist in the Soviet Union. With his first wife, Lyubov Bruk, he formed a piano duo, some of whose recordings were included in the Phillips and Steinway series &quot;Great Pianists of the 20th Century&quot;. Taimanov personally knew composer Dmitri Shostakovich, cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and pianist Sviatoslav Richter.

==Personal life and death==
Taimanov married four times. He remarried late in life, and became the father of twins at the age of 78. Fifty-seven years separate his oldest child (who was also a strong chess player and on one occasion, participated in the final of the Leningrad City Championship) and his twins.

His younger sister Irina Taimanova (born 1941) is a prominent opera director, TV presenter and professor at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.

Taimanov died on 28 November 2016 in Saint Petersburg, at the age of 90.

<doc id="546875" wikidata="Q1138084" url="?curid=546875" title="Prisoners of the Sun">
<text>Prisoners of the Sun () is the fourteenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised weekly in the newly established &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from September 1946 to April 1948. Completing an arc begun in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, the story tells of young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and friend Captain Haddock as they continue their efforts to rescue the kidnapped Professor Calculus by travelling through Andean villages, mountains, and rain forests, before finding a hidden Inca civilisation.

&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman the year following its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1992–1993 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, the 1997 video game of the same name, and a 2001 musical in Dutch and French versions.

==Synopsis==
:&quot;The synopsis continues a plot begun in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;.&quot;

Young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and friend Captain Haddock arrive in Callao, Peru. There, they plan to intercept the arrival of the &quot;Pachacamac&quot;, a ship carrying their friend Professor Calculus, who is being held by kidnappers. Unfortunately, the ship has to be in quarantine for three weeks, due to reports of infectious disease on board. Suspecting the quarantine is staged, Tintin sneaks aboard the ship that night and learns from Chiquito, the former assistant of General Alcazar and one of the abductors, that Calculus is to be executed for wearing a bracelet belonging to the mummified Incan king Rascar Capac.

Tintin barely escapes the ship with his life, and he and Haddock alert the authorities; but the abductors evade the police and take Calculus to the Andes mountains. Tintin and Haddock pursue them to the mountain town of Jauga, where they board a train that is sabotaged in an attempt to kill them. When they attempt to investigate the whereabouts of Calculus, the local Indios prove to be peculiarly tight-lipped—that is, until Tintin defends a young Quechua boy named Zorrino from being bullied by two Spaniard men. A mysterious man observes this act of kindness and gives Tintin a medallion, telling him that it will save him from danger. Zorrino informs Tintin that Calculus has been taken to the Temple of the Sun, which lies deep within the Andes, and offers to take them there.

After many hardships – including being pursued by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead, and finding their way through the snowy mountains and the jungle beyond – Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, a surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar&#x27;s medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.

Tintin and Haddock end up on the same pyre as Calculus. However, Tintin has chosen the hour of their death to coincide with a solar eclipse, and through play-acting he convinces the terrified Incas that he can command the Sun. The Inca prince implores Tintin to make the Sun show its light again. At Tintin&#x27;s &quot;command&quot;, the Sun returns, and the three are quickly set free. Afterwards, the Prince of the Sun tells them that the seven crystal balls used on the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members, who had excavated Rascar Capac&#x27;s tomb, contained a &quot;mystic liquid&quot; obtained from coca that plunged them into a deep sleep. Each time the Inca high priest cast his spell over seven wax figures of the explorers, he could use them as he willed as punishment for their sacrilege. Tintin convinces the Inca prince that the explorers acted in good faith, as they only intended to make known to the world the splendours of the Inca civilisation. The Inca prince orders Chiquito to destroy the wax figures, and at that moment in Belgium, the seven explorers awaken in surprise. After swearing an oath to keep the temple&#x27;s existence a secret, Tintin, Haddock and Calculus head home, while Zorrino remains with the Inca, having accepted an offer to live among them. Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson&#x27;s plan to find Tintin and his friends with Calculus&#x27; pendulum leads them on a around the world.

==History==

===Background===

Amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, Hergé had accepted a position working for &#x27;, the largest circulation French-language daily newspaper in the country. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities permitted &#x27; to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. Joining &#x27; on 15 October 1940, Hergé was aided by old friend Paul Jamin and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke. Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the then occupying Nazi administration, although he was heavily impressed by the size of &quot;s readership, which reached 600,000. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Without the need to satirise political types, entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that &quot;Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively&quot;.

As with two previous stories, &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, Hergé developed the idea of a twofold story arc, resulting in the two-part &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy&#x27;s curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter&#x27;s 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. This was not the first time that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously drawn from it when authoring &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;.

The story began serialisation in &#x27; under the title of &#x27; on 16 December 1943. It was, however, interrupted on 2 September 1944, as Brussels was liberated from German occupation by the Allied forces on 3 September, upon which &quot;&quot; immediately ceased publication. Hergé had been forced to abandon the story after 152 strips, equivalent to fifty pages of the later published book volume. The story had been left unfinished after the scene in which Tintin leaves the hospital where he sees the seven members of the expedition enduring a simultaneous fit. Three days later the entire staff were fired and a new editorial team introduced. In October 1945, Hergé was approached by Raymond Leblanc, a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the National Royalist Movement (MNR), and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children. Leblanc, who had fond childhood memories of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, thought Hergé would be ideal for it. Hergé agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work.

===Influences===

Hergé had adopted the idea of a person abducted into a lost Incan city from Gaston Leroux&#x27;s 1912 novel, &quot;The Bride of the Sun&quot;, in which the idea of a solar eclipse also appeared. In turn, the idea of European explorers discovering a lost city had been found in both H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1887) and Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar&quot; (1916). His use of the eclipse may also have been influenced by accounts claiming that Christopher Columbus subdued a revolt of indigenous groups in Jamaica in 1503 using knowledge of a lunar eclipse that had been predicted by Giovanni Muller&#x27;s 1474 calendar.

Hergé&#x27;s principal source of information about the Andes was Charles Wiener&#x27;s 1880 book &quot;Pérou et Bolivie&quot; (&quot;Peru and Bolivia&quot;), which contained 1,100 engravings from which Hergé could base his own illustrations. In this way, small details about Andean costume and material culture were accurately copied. Part of the ceremonial costume worn by the Incan priest was based upon a colour painting of Mexican Aztecs produced by Else Bostelmann for the National Geographic Society which Hergé had a copy of in his files. He ensured that his depiction of the Peruvian trains was accurate by basing them upon examples found in a two-volume picture encyclopedia of railways published by Librarie Hachette in 1927.

Hergé sent his assistant, Edgar P. Jacobs, to the Cinquantenaire Museum to study its collections of Incan material, and also used Jacobs as a model for several of the poses that characters adopt in the story. He had a striped poncho specially made, which he then asked Jacobs to model.
Hergé later concluded that the scene in which Tintin hoodwinked the Inca with his knowledge of the sun was implausible, suggesting that solar worshipers with a keen knowledge of astronomy like the Inca would have been well aware of the sun and its eclipses.

===Publication===
&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; was the first of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be serialised in its entirety in the new &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. On the magazine&#x27;s launch day of 26 September 1946, readers who had been without Tintin for two years now received two pages per week in full colour under the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Temple of the Sun&quot;). It began on what is now page 50 of the previous book &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and included two pages outlining the crystal ball mystery, presented as if it were a press cutting. With Jacobs, Hergé completed the cover of the first issue and finished off &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; prior to embarking on &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, although Hergé included both under the title of &quot;The Temple of the Sun&quot;. To lessen his workload, a portion of the two pages of Hergé&#x27;s strip was an explanatory block of text about Inca society, titled &quot;Qui étaient les Incas?&quot; (&quot;Who were the Incas?&quot;). Covering issues such as geography, history, and religion, each block was signed in Tintin&#x27;s name.

In May 1947, Hergé and Jacobs ended their partnership of nearly four years after an argument. When requested by Hergé to work with him full-time on &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, Jacobs agreed to do so on the condition that he be credited as co-creator of the new &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Hergé, however, had grown jealous of the immediate success of Jacobs&#x27; other contribution to &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot; (the first entry in his &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; series), and was concerned about his colleague&#x27;s reputation overshadowing his own. He denied the request, claiming that his publisher, Casterman, would never agree to the shared credit. Although biographer Pierre Assouline described the separation as &quot;friendly&quot;, a &quot;barely suppressed bitterness&quot; remained between the two men.

On 17 June 1947, serialisation of the story paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown as a result of overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote: &quot;Life has spoilt me ... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to not so long ago. Tintin is no longer me ... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged&quot;. He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that &quot;our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don&#x27;t worry, he&#x27;s fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring you a new episode of &quot;The Temple of the Sun&quot; each week, our friend is a little over-worked&quot;. He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to Assouline, he was accompanied by a young, married woman with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.

While writing &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, Hergé decided that he wanted to move to Argentina, and focused his attention on completing all outstanding commissions so that he could focus on his emigration. He enlisted the aid of Van Melkebeke, Guy Dessicy, and Frans Jageneau to help finish &quot;Prisoners&quot;; they gathered at his home on the Avenue Delleur and produced many of the backgrounds within the story. He also employed his friend Bernard Heuvelmans to help devise the ending of the story; he paid Heuvelmans 43,000 Belgian francs for doing so.
Ultimately, Hergé changed his mind about moving to Argentina for reasons that remain unknown. Serialisation of &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; culminated on 22 April 1948. As with previous adventures, the title had also been serialised in the French Catholic newspaper &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, from 30 November 1947.

===Republication===
After the story arc finished serialisation, Casterman divided it into two volumes, &#x27; and &#x27;, which they released in 1948 and 1949 respectively. To fit into the 62-page format, a number of scenes were deleted from the story&#x27;s publication in book form. These included a scene in which Tintin chases away a cat aboard the &quot;Pachacamac&quot;, slapstick gags featuring Thomson and Thompson, Haddock drawing a picture of Tintin on a wall, Haddock chewing coca provided by Zorrino, Tintin shooting a jaguar, and Haddock discovering gold nuggets under the Temple of the Sun but being unable to take them back with him. British &quot;Tintin&quot; expert Michael Farr noted that none of these scenes were &quot;integral to the narrative&quot;, and that their removal improved its structure. The reformatting also led to an error in the depiction of the solar eclipse. In the original magazine serialisation, Hergé had depicted the moon moving across the sun in the correct direction for the Southern Hemisphere; for the book publication, the drawings had been altered, with the moon now moving in the incorrect direction.

The book was banned by the Peruvian authorities because, in the map of South America contained within it, a region whose ownership was disputed by Peru and Ecuador was shown as being part of the latter country.

==Critical analysis==
Michael Farr described both &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; as &quot;classic middle-period Tintin&quot;, commenting on their &quot;surprisingly well-balanced narrative&quot; and the fact that they exhibited scant evidence of Hergé&#x27;s turbulent personal life. He felt that the inclusion of paranormal elements to the story did nothing to make the narrative less convincing, and observes Hergé&#x27;s recurring depiction of his character&#x27;s disturbing dreams. Farr opined that the Inca costumes were drawn with &quot;a care and flamboyance that would do great credit to a major opera house production&quot;, while the Andean landscapes were &quot;worthy of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular&quot;. Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters noted that &quot;Prisoner of the Sun&quot; was one of the &quot;Adventures&quot; to have &quot;most caught the imagination&quot;, something that he attributed to its &quot;exceptional setting or the strength of the plot&quot;.

Harry Thompson noted that, like &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; was &quot;an epic journey conditioned by the suspense of not knowing what will happen at the end&quot;; although he thought that, unlike &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, it &quot;successfully transfers the fear of its unknown adversaries from the first part of the adventure into the second&quot;. He also thought that, despite all the tribulations Hergé faced while creating it, &quot;the pacing, the retention of suspense right to the end, and the fine balance of humour and drama&quot; do not betray the story&#x27;s troubled development.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that the two-story arc represents &quot;one more leap forward in Hergé&#x27;s graphic and narrative skills&quot; as a result of the transition to full colour double pages as the initial means of publication. They thought that this improvement was particularly evident in the scenes of the trek through the Andes in &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. They stated that with &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, the story had switched into &quot;Hitchcockian thriller mode&quot;, a similar technique that Hergé had adopted into a number of previous adventures. They described the character of Zorrino as &quot;basically a Peruvian version&quot; of Chang Chong-Chen, a character introduced to the series in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. They described the story as &quot;a philosophical parable, perhaps a hidden reflection of Hergé&#x27;s spiritual yearnings&quot;; in this way anticipating the themes that he would make use of in &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. Ultimately, they awarded both halves of the story arc five out of five.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac&#x27;s jewels reflected Hergé&#x27;s use of jewellery as a theme throughout the series, and that the scene in which Tintin commands the sun god to do his bidding reflects a wider theme throughout the series in which &quot;sacred authority&quot; manifests through voice. The scene in which Haddock causes an avalanche of snow by sneezing reflected what McCarthy considered a wider theme of the danger of sound, while Zorrino&#x27;s decision to stay among the Inca was interpreted as a reflection of a wider theme of adoption. Commenting on the execution scene, McCarthy believed that it represented Haddock being &quot;sacrificed on the altar of his own illegitimacy&quot;, a concept that he felt had been echoed throughout the series.

In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed that &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;–&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; arc reflects a confrontation between civilisations, and between the sacred and the secular. He described the Quechuan society depicted by Hergé as a &quot;totalitarian theocracy&quot;, noting that the Tintin of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; and &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; would have approved of such a political system. He then drew comparisons between the Incan Prince of the Sun and the Syldavian King Muskar XII in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, noting that in both the monarch is threatened by losing a treasured cultural artefact to foreigners. Apostolidès also believed that the eclipse scene reflects a change in the power relations between the sacrificed (Tintin) and the sacrificer (the Inca prince). Commenting on Tintin&#x27;s dream sequence in which he dreams of Calculus and Haddock, Apostolidès believed that it reflected a &quot;latent homosexual desire&quot;, comparing it with the dream sequence in &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1969, the animation company Belvision Studios, which had produced the 1956–57 television series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, released its first feature-length animated film, &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot;, adapted from the &quot;Seven Crystal Balls&quot;-&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; story arc. Produced by Raymond Leblanc and directed by Eddie Lateste, it was written by Lateste, the cartoonist Greg, Jos Marissen, and Laszló Molnár. Music was by François Rauber and Zorrino&#x27;s song was composed by Jacques Brel.

In 1991, a second animated series based upon &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; was the twelfth story to be adapted and was divided into two thirty-minute episodes. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot; to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé&#x27;s original panels.

In 1997, the French company Infogrames released a video game based on &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;-&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; story arc, titled &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; were adapted into a theatrical musical, &quot;Kuifje – De Zonnetempel&quot; (&quot;Tintin – The Temple of the Sun&quot;), which premiered in Dutch at the Stadsschouwburg in Antwerp, Belgium, on 15 September. Adapted for the stage by Seth Gaaikema and Frank Van Laecke, the production was directed by Dirk de Caluwé and included music by Dirk Brossé, featuring Tom Van Landuyt in the role of Tintin. Didier Van Cauwelaert adapted the musical into French, and it then premiered a year later in Charleroi as &quot;Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil&quot;. From there, the production was scheduled for Paris in 2003 but was cancelled. It returned for a brief run in Antwerp on 18 October 2007.

In 2018, it was reported that &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; would be the basis for the sequel to 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn,&quot; which was directed by Steven Spielberg with Peter Jackson as executive producer. For the second film, Jackson and Spielberg would switch roles, with Jackson directing. Since then, however, apart from reassurances from both Spielberg and Jackson that the film would be forthcoming, there has been no news about its production.

<text>Land of Black Gold () is the fifteenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , in which it was initially serialised from September 1939 until the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, at which the newspaper was shut down and the story interrupted. After eight years, Hergé returned to &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, completing its serialisation in Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from September 1948 to February 1950, after which it was published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1950. Set on the eve of a European war, the plot revolves around the attempts of young Belgian reporter Tintin to uncover a militant group responsible for sabotaging oil supplies in the Middle East.

At the request of Hergé&#x27;s British publisher, Methuen, in 1971 he made a range of alterations to the &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, transferring the setting from the British Mandate for Palestine to the fictional state of Khemed. As with the revised edition of &quot;The Black Island&quot;, most of the changes to this third version of the volume were carried out by Hergé&#x27;s assistant, Bob de Moor. Hergé followed &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; with &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, while &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critical approaches to the story have been mixed, with differing opinions expressed as to the competing merits of the volume&#x27;s three versions. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; by Ellipse and Nelvana.

==Plot==
Across Europe, car engines are spontaneously exploding; this coincides with the spectre of a potential war throughout the continent, resulting in Captain Haddock being mobilised into the navy. Although detectives Thomson and Thompson initially suspect that the oil crisis is a scam intended to drive up business for a local roadside assistance company, Tintin learns from the managing director of Belgium&#x27;s leading oil company, Speedol, that it is a result of someone tampering with the petrol at its source, and discovers a conspiracy involving a crew member of one of their petrol tankers, the &quot;Speedol Star&quot;. The three work undercover as new members of the &quot;Star&quot;&#x27;s crew as it sets off for the Middle Eastern kingdom of Khemed. Recognising Snowy from Tintin&#x27;s earlier scouting of the ship, the treacherous mate attempts to drown the dog, but becomes amnesiac in an altercation with Tintin.

Upon arrival, Tintin and the detectives are framed and arrested by the authorities under various charges. Thomson and Thompson are cleared and released, but Tintin is kidnapped by the Arab insurgent Bab El Ehr, who mistakenly believes that Tintin has information for him concerning an arms delivery. Tintin escapes and encounters an old enemy, Dr. Müller, sabotaging an oil pipeline. He reunites with Thomson and Thompson during a sandstorm and eventually arrives in Khemed&#x27;s capital city of Wadesdah. When Tintin narrates the sabotage orchestrated by Müller to the Emir Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, one of the Emir&#x27;s attendants, Ali Ben Mahmud, informs the Emir that his son Prince Abdullah is missing. Suspecting that Müller has kidnapped Abdullah, Tintin sets out to rescue the prince.

While on Müller&#x27;s trail, Tintin meets his old friend, the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira. With Figueira&#x27;s help, Tintin enters Müller&#x27;s house and knocks him unconscious. Tintin knocks Abdullah down and as Abdullah throws tantrums, Tintin starts arguing with him. He finds the prince imprisoned in a dungeon and rescues him as Haddock arrives with the authorities. Müller is revealed to be the agent of a foreign power responsible for the tampering of the fuel supplies, having invented a type of chemical in tablet form, codenamed Formula 14, which increases the explosive power of oil by a significant amount. Thomson and Thompson find the tablets and, mistaking them for aspirin due to their being packaged as such, swallow them, resulting in them growing long hair and beards that change colour. After analysing the tablets, Professor Calculus develops an antidote for Thomson and Thompson and a means of countering the affected oil supplies.

==History==

===Background and influences===

Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was employed as editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels, formerly run by the &quot;Abbé&quot; Norbert Wallez, who had subsequently been removed from the paper&#x27;s editorship following a scandal. In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip for , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin.
Hergé incorporated several characters into the story who had previously been introduced in earlier &quot;Adventures&quot;; this included Dr. Müller, a German villain who had previously appeared in &quot;The Black Island&quot;, and the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who had first appeared in &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;. Hergé also included a reference to the recurring character Bianca Castafiore, whose singing appears on the radio in one scene. He also introduced a number of new characters in the story; this included the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab, a character who was based largely on Ibn Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia, whom Hergé had learned about from a 1939 book by Anton Zischke. It has also been suggested that the character was partly inspired by the deceased Iraqi leader, Faisal I. The character of the Emir&#x27;s son, Prince Abdullah, was inspired by the King of Iraq, Faisal II, who was appointed monarch in 1939 aged four, although in creating this character Hergé had also been influenced by an obnoxious child character that appears in the work of O. Henry.

The idea of European nations rivaling each other for oil supplies was inspired by a February 1934 issue of &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot; magazine.
The fictional Arabic names that Hergé integrated into the story were parodies based on the Marollien dialect of Brussels; &quot;Wadesdah&quot; translated as &quot;what is that?&quot;, &quot;Bab El Ehr&quot; was Marollien for chatterbox, Kalish Ezab derived from the Marollien term for sugarelly, and Moulfrid, the last name of Kalish Ezab&#x27;s military adviser Yussuf Ben Mulfrid (Youssouf Ben Moulfrid in the original French version), is named after a dish named &quot;Moules-frites&quot;.

&quot;Boum!&quot;, an iconic song by Charles Trenet, appears in parody as the roadside assistance company&#x27;s advertising jingle, which plays on Thomson and Thompson&#x27;s car radio at the very beginning of the story. The Supermarine Spitfire, a British single-seat fighter aircraft, was used as the model for Kalish Ezab&#x27;s plane which drops leaflets onto Bab El Ehr&#x27;s camp.
In creating &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, Hergé adopted many elements from a previously aborted idea about militants blowing up prominent buildings in Europe; rather than European buildings, this story would involve industrial sabotage.

===First version: 1939–40===

Following the German invasion of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, he returned to Brussels and began &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;. The story subsequently began serialisation in &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; was shut down part way through the serialisation of &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, on 8 May. The point at which the story was ended corresponds to pages 28 and 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is caught in a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Müller. This version, which amounts to 58 pages, has never been collected in book form.

Given its portrayal of Germans as the antagonists of the story, it would not have been appropriate for &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; to continue serialisation under Nazi occupation.
After being published in Belgium, the story began serialisation in neighbouring France; initially appearing in the magazine &quot;Cœurs Vaillants-Âmes Vaillants&quot; from 4 August 1940, the story was ultimately interrupted, and would only recommence in June 1945, this time in the magazine &quot;Message Aux Cœurs Vaillants&quot;. From December 1945 to May 1946 it then appeared in a youth supplement to the newspaper &quot;La Voix de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; under the title of &quot;Tintin et Milou au pays de l&#x27;or liquide&quot; (&quot;Tintin and Snowy in the Land of Liquid Gold&quot;).

===Second version: 1948–49===
By the late 1940s, after the end of the Second World War, Hergé was continuing to produce new instalments of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; for the Belgian magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; in April 1948, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, &quot;Popol Out West&quot;, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.
Hergé was planning on creating a story in which Tintin travels to the moon, but his wife Germaine and close friend Marcel Dehaye both advised him to revive &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; instead, recognising that it would entail less work and thus cause him less stress. Thus, &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; was revived after an eight-year hiatus. In a letter to Germaine, he stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t like to restart things that are already finished, or to make repairs. &quot;Black Gold&quot; was a repair, and I abandoned it&quot;.

The story began serialisation in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from 16 September 1948, before beginning its serialisation in the French edition of the magazine from 28 October. Rather than continuing at the point where he had previously left off, Hergé restarted the story from scratch. He nevertheless made revisions to the early part of the story, namely by reworking the characters of Captain Haddock (who now first appears in a new scene on page 3) and Professor Calculus, as well as the location of Marlinspike Hall, into the narrative, all of which were elements that had been introduced to the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; during the intervening eight years. Other alterations include new scenes of Tintin making a divining rod, Tintin disguising himself as one of Müller&#x27;s henchmen, and a restructuring of the Thompsons&#x27; humorous antics while driving a Jeep (a Peugeot 201 in the original version) prior to their reunion with Tintin; the scene in which they fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a mosque, for instance, originally took place without Tintin&#x27;s presence. Hergé was contractually obliged to produce two pages of comic for each issue, and in the previous adventure, &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, had fulfilled this by producing two pages of new Tintin stories each week. Seeking to limit his workload, he would only produce one page of &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; per issue, with the other page being filled by a re-serialisation of old stories from his &quot;Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot; series.

On 4 August 1949, the story was suspended part way through its serialisation as Hergé left Belgium for a holiday near Gland, Switzerland. The magazine used this as a publicity stunt, posting a headline in their next issue declaring &quot;Shocking News: Hergé Has Disappeared!&quot; to encourage speculation as to his whereabouts among the young readership. His co-workers and staff at &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine were increasingly annoyed by unplanned absences such as this, which affected the entire production; his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs sent him letters urging him to return to work. After an absence of twelve weeks, &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; continued serialisation on 27 October. Following its serialisation, &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; was collected together and published in a 62-page colour volume by Editions Casterman in 1950.

===Third version: 1971===

After Hergé had redrawn &quot;The Black Island&quot; for publication in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; before releasing it into the UK market; in compliance with their requests, much of the content between pages 6 and 20 was rewritten and redrawn. Hergé&#x27;s assistant, Bob de Moor, was responsible for many of the alterations. De Moor was sent to the port at Antwerp to sketch a 1939 oil tanker that would provide a basis for a ship that appears in the story, the &quot;Speedol Star&quot;. For this version, Hergé transplanted the events of the story from Palestine to the fictional Emirate of Khemed and its capital city of Wadesdah, a setting that he had used in a later adventure, &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;. This modernised third version was issued by Casterman in 1971.

In the original versions, Tintin arrived at Haifa in the British Mandate of Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by members of the Irgun, a Zionist terrorist organization, who mistake him for one of their own agents (named &quot;Finkelstein&quot; in the first version, &quot;Salomon Goldstein&quot; in the second), before being abducted by a henchman of Bab El Ehr. In this revised version, Tintin arrives at Khemkhah in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken directly to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and thus were removed from the story, including the characters of the British officers Commandant [&quot;sic&quot;] Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards (respectively responsible for the Thompsons&#x27; detainment and release, and the arresting of the Irgun agents who kidnapped Tintin). These changes were also applied to a scene which a Supermarine Spitfire drops propaganda leaflets on Bab El Ehr&#x27;s camp: in the earlier versions, the plane is British and Bab El Ehr threatens to shoot anyone who reads the leaflets; in the revised scene, the plane is from an unidentified rival Arabic nation and Bab El Ehr laughs off the bombardment as his men are illiterate. As a result of the truncation of Tintin&#x27;s kidnapping, which now occurs two pages earlier than in the second version, the Thompsons&#x27; crash into a palm tree in the desert now takes place after the aforementioned scene. Background details was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed, and the nonsensical pseudo-Arabic script from the earlier versions was replaced with real Arabic text. The political rivalry between Britain and Germany that was present in the earlier versions was also toned down.

==Critical analysis==

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters stated that &quot;no book has gone through more ups and downs&quot; than &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, adding that it carries a &quot;mood of foreboding&quot; caused by the impending war in the story. He also felt that the introduction of the Emir and Abdullah was &quot;the most striking innovation in this story&quot;, and elsewhere declared that its earlier versions contained &quot;not the slightest trace of anti-Semitism&quot;, despite allegations that a number of other &quot;Adventures&quot; featuring Jewish characters exhibited anti-Semitic stereotypes.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; suffered from having been &quot;rebaked&quot;, being &quot;pulled between the &#x27;old&#x27; pre-war Tintin and the more modern one&quot;. The Lofficiers opined that the story&#x27;s &quot;clear concern about war and rumours of war&quot; enable it to fit well after &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, at the point at which Hergé had initially developed it. They felt that this pre-Second World War atmosphere also pervaded the second, coloured version of the book, but that they had nevertheless been partly removed by the creation of the third version. Despite this, they felt that the third version of the story was &quot;better&quot; because it incorporated elements from the spy thrillers that had become increasingly popular in Western Europe during the 1950s. Despite its problems, they thought that the Thom(p)sons&#x27; ingestion of Formula 14 was &quot;virtually inspired&quot;, showing that Hergé &quot;had lost none of his touch when it comes to creating unforgettable images&quot;. They opined that the character of Abdullah &quot;indisputably steals the show&quot; in &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, commenting on his &quot;love-hate&quot; relationship with Haddock and suggesting that he is &quot;possibly the only character to have ever succeeded in driving Tintin so batty that he loses his cool&quot;. Regarding Haddock&#x27;s inclusion in the later editions of the story, the Lofficiers felt that he was retroactively &quot;shoehorned&quot; into the narrative, but noted that the running gag of Haddock&#x27;s failed attempts to provide an adequate explanation for his appearance ― each beginning with the phrase &quot;It&#x27;s quite simple really, and at the same time rather complicated&quot; ― anticipates the &quot;self-referential and second-degree&quot; humour Hergé would employ in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. They ultimately awarded the story two stars out of five, feeling that Hergé had been unable to develop its &quot;greater potential&quot;.

Michael Farr believed that &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; illustrated how &quot;shelved material could be usefully resuscitated&quot;. He added that in making revisions to the story for the 1971 version, &quot;the result is disappointing, lacking the pungency which the contemporary allusion gave the earlier version&quot;.
Farr felt that in this story, the Thom(p)sons &quot;have a splendid adventure&quot; with the various scenarios that they get into.
Harry Thompson described &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; as a &quot;patchwork effort&quot;, believing that the final result owed little to the &quot;story&#x27;s original satirical thrust&quot;. He praised Khemed as Hergé&#x27;s &quot;most successful imaginary country&quot;, something that he attributed to its &quot;geographic accuracy&quot; and to the &quot;realistic parody&quot; of Arabic names. However, he criticised the way in which Haddock had been integrated into the story, deeming this to be &quot;the least satisfying aspect&quot; of it. Believing that it offered a &quot;fine swansong&quot; for the decline of the Thom(p)sons as central characters in the series, ultimately Thompson felt that &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; retained a &quot;somewhat fragmentary air&quot;. Differing from Thompson&#x27;s assessment, Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline felt that the inclusion of Haddock into the story was successful, &quot;precisely because [it] defied all logic&quot;.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that in the story, the desert represented &quot;a space of multiple misreading&quot;, which included the mirages, fake documents, and cases of mistaken identity. Focusing on those fake documents, he believed that it represented the theme of fakery which recurs throughout the series. Describing the scenario in which Thomson and Thompson are lost and driving around the desert, he refers to it as a &quot;brilliantly allegorical scene&quot;, before highlighting Hergé&#x27;s &quot;wishful retroactive wiping out of history&quot; by evading the war.
In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès dealt only briefly with &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, commenting that Calculus&#x27; development of a cure for the Thom(p)sons&#x27; consumption of N14 was a sign of his growing status and reputation as a scientist, as he moved from being the &quot;small-time, ridiculous&quot; inventor of &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; and came to establish himself as the internationally renowned scientist of &quot;Destination Moon&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; was the thirteenth episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be produced. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original album.

<text>John William Steakley, Jr. (July 26, 1951 – November 27, 2010) was an American science fiction author. He published two major novels, &quot;Armor&quot; (1984) and &quot;Vampire$&quot; (1990); the latter was the basis for John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Vampires&quot; movie. He published four short science fiction and fantasy stories.

== Personal life ==
Steakley was born in Cleburne, Texas. Aside from brief spells in South America and Hollywood, Steakley lived most of his life in Texas. Steakley&#x27;s father owned a Chevrolet dealership in Dallas from 1962 until he sold it in 1999. Steakley attended St. Mark&#x27;s School and graduated from Colorado Academy, a boarding school in Denver. He then went on to study at Westminster College in Missouri, and at Southern Methodist University, where he received his BA in English.

In 1988, Steakley married photographer Lori Jones; they held their wedding reception in the showroom of a local Subaru dealership. He was an avid golfer and in the mid-1990s carried a single-digit handicap. He died after a five-year battle with liver disease.

== Career ==
Steakley&#x27;s sister told the press that he went to Hollywood at the invitation of screenwriter L.M. &quot;Kit&quot; Carson. He sold a film treatment, and played a bit part (&quot;Local 1&quot;) in at least one film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Open the Door!&quot;, but &quot;he stayed out there a few years and just hated it.&quot; Following through on his childhood fantasy of becoming a science fiction writer, Steakley returned to Texas, and wrote. He published his first professional short story, &quot;The Bluenose Limit&quot;, in the March 1981 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;; and another, &quot;Flyer&quot;, in the September 1982 issue. He published two major novels, &quot;Armor&quot; (1984) and &quot;Vampire$&quot; (1990). According to his website, he worked on the incomplete &quot;Armor II&quot; for years.

Steakley wrote the screenplay for the 1997 film, &quot;Scary Texas Movie&quot;; he also played a nameless bit part in that film. Steakley also played a nameless bit part in the 2000 film &quot;Playing Dead&quot;.

In 1998, John Carpenter directed a screen adaptation of &quot;Vampire$&quot; (retitled &quot;Vampires&quot;), which starred James Woods as the leader of a Catholic Church-sanctioned team of vampire hunters.

<doc id="546880" wikidata="Q2668083" url="?curid=546880" title="Timariots">
<text>Timariot (or &quot;tımar&quot; holder; &quot;tımarlı&quot; in Turkish) was the name given to a Sipahi cavalryman in the Ottoman army. In return for service, each timariot received a parcel of revenue called a [[timar]], a fief, which were usually recently conquered plots of agricultural land in the countryside. Far less commonly, the sultan would grant a civil servant or member of the imperial family a timar. Also non-military timar holders were obliged to supply the imperial army with soldiers and provisions.

The timariots provided the backbone of the Ottoman cavalry force and the army as a whole. They were obligated to fight as cavalrymen in the Ottoman military when called upon. The timariots had to assemble with the army when at war, and had to take care of the land entrusted to him in times of peace. When at war, the timariot had to bring his own equipment and in addition a number of armed retainers (&quot;cebelu&quot;). The timariot was granted feudatory with the obligation to go mounted to war and to supply soldiers and sailors in numbers proportionate to the revenue of the appanage. The timariot owed personal service for his sword in time of war and for a certain sum of money owed a number of soldiers as a substitute (&quot;cebelu&quot;). The (&quot;cebelu&quot;) was bound to live on the timariot’s estate and look after the land. When summoned for campaign the timariot and his &quot;cebelu&quot; had to present themselves with a cuirass. When a timariot failed to obey the summon he was deprived of his timar for one or two years. Timariots were expected to bring &quot;cebelus&quot; or men-at-arms as well as their own equipment on campaign, the number of &quot;cebelu&quot; being determined by revenue. The number of the timariots in the sultan&#x27;s army fluctuated between 50,000 and 90,000 men. Timariots were themselves organized by sanjak-beys who ruled over groups of timars. The sanjak-beys were subordinate to the beylerbeyi and then the sultan himself. This semi-feudal arrangement allowed for the Ottomans to organize large armies at once, thus making an imperial army from what was still essentially a medieval economy. This system of using agricultural revenue to pay troops was influenced by a similar Byzantine practice and other Near Eastern states prior to the Ottoman Empire.

During peace, timariots were expected to manage the lands they were given. Each timariot did not own the land that had been granted. All agricultural lands in the Empire that were considered state property (or &quot;miri&quot;) could be granted as timars. Timariots could be removed and transferred when the sultan deemed it necessary. However, timariots were expected to collect taxes and manage the peasantry. The &quot;kanunname&quot; of each sanjak listed the specific amount of taxes and services that the timariot could collect. The central government enforced these laws rigorously, and a sipahi could lose his timar for violating regulations. The timar-holders took precautions to keep peasants on their land and were also owed certain labor from peasants, such as building a barn. The maximum amount of income from one timar was 9,999 &quot;akce&quot; per year, but most timariots did not make anywhere close to that. In the 1530s, 40 percent of timariots received less than 3,000 &quot;akce&quot; in revenue. Higher ranking officers could receive a ziamet (up to 100,000 &quot;akces&quot;) or a &quot;has&quot; (over 100,000 &quot;akce&quot;), depending on importance. The number of men and equipment the &quot;timariotes&quot; had to provide was dependent on the size of his land holdings. When the annual income of the holding was above 4.000 akçe the sipahi had to be accompanied by a soldier in a coat of mail, for income above 15.000 akçe by additional soldier for each additional 3.000 akçe. Above a certain income of the &quot;timar&quot; the sipahi horse had also to be equipped with armor of very thin steel. Tents for different purposes e.g., for treasury, kitchen, saddlery store, etc. had to be provided. This ensured that all equipment and troops for campaigns was determined in advance and Ottoman commanders knew the exact number of their forces for mobilization.

When the Ottomans conquered new territory, it was common practice to grant timars to the local aristocracy of conquered lands. The Ottomans co-opted the local nobility and eased the burden of conquest. The first group of timars in the Balkans had a strong Christian majority (60 percent in Serbia and 82 percent in Bosnia in 1467-69), but the Christian sipahis gradually disappeared due to dispossession or conversion to Islam. 

Timar-status could be inherited, but the pieces of land were not inheritable to avoid the creation of any stable landed nobility. Timars were not hereditary until a decree was passed in 1585. Those who vied for timar status were fiercely competitive and the barrier to entry was high. The sipahis were also in constant competition for control of the Ottoman military with the janissary class.

<doc id="546881" wikidata="Q924421" url="?curid=546881" title="Septic arthritis">
<text>Acute septic arthritis, infectious arthritis, suppurative arthritis, pyogenic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or joint infection is the invasion of a joint by an infectious agent resulting in joint inflammation. Generally speaking, symptoms typically include redness, heat and pain in a single joint associated with a decreased ability to move the joint. Onset is usually rapid. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness and headache. Occasionally, more than one joint may be involved, especially in neonates, younger children and immunocompromised individuals. In neonates, infants during the first year of life, and toddlers, the signs and symptoms of septic arthritis can be deceptive and mimic other infectious and non-infectious disorders.
In children, septic arthritis is usually caused by non-specific bacterial infection and commonly hematogenous, i.e., spread through the bloodstream. Septic arthritis and/or acute hematogenous osteomyelitis usually occurs in children with no co-occurring health problems. Other routes of infection include direct trauma and spread from a nearby abscess. Other less common cause include specific bacteria as mycobacterium tuberculosis, viruses, fungi and parasites. In children, however, there are certain groups that are specifically vulnerable to such infections, namely preterm infants, neonates in general, children and adolescents with hematologic disorders, renal osteodystrophy, and immune-compromised status. In adults, vulnerable groups include those with an artificial joint, prior arthritis, diabetes and poor immune function. Diagnosis is generally based on accurate correlation between history-taking and clinical examination findings, and basic laboratory and imaging findings like joint ultrasound.
In children, septic arthritis can have serious consequences if not treated appropriately and timely. Initial treatment typically includes antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftriaxone or ceftazidime. Surgery in the form of joint drainage is the gold standard management in large joints like the hip and shoulder. Without early treatment, long-term joint problems may occur, such as irreversible joint destruction and dislocation.
==Signs and symptoms==
===Children===
In children septic arthritis usually affects the larger joints like the hips, knees and shoulders. The early signs and symptoms of septic arthritis in children and adolescents can be confused with limb injury. Among the signs and symptoms of septic arthritis are: acutely swollen, red, painful joint with fever. Kocher criteria have been suggested to predict the diagnosis of septic arthritis in children.

Importantly, observation of active limb motion or kicking in the lower limb can provide valuable clues to septic arthritis of hip or knee. In neonates/new born and infants the hip joint is characteristically held in abduction flexion and external rotation. This position helps the infant accommodate maximum amount of septic joint fluid with the least tension possible. The tendency to have multiple joint involvements in septic arthritis of neonates and young children should be closely considered.

===Adults===
In adults, septic arthritis most commonly causes pain, swelling and warmth at the affected joint. Therefore, those affected by septic arthritis will often refuse to use the extremity and prefer to hold the joint rigidly. Fever is also a symptom; however, it is less likely in older people. In adults the most common joint affected is the knee. Hip, shoulder, wrist and elbow joints are less commonly affected. Spine, sternoclavicular and sacroiliac joints can also be involved. The most common cause of arthritis in these joints is intravenous drug use. Usually, only one joint is affected. More than one joint can be involved if bacteria are spread through the bloodstream.

===Prosthetic joint===

For those with artificial joint implants, there is a chance of 0.86 to 1.1% of getting infected in a knee joint and 0.3 to 1.7% of getting infected in a hip joint. 

There are three phases of artificial joint infection: early, delayed and late.
* Early – infection occurs in less than 3 months. Usual signs and symptoms are fever and joint pain, with redness and warmth over the joint operation site. The mode of infection is during the joint implant surgery. The usual bacteria involved are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and gram negative bacilli.
* Delayed – infection occurs between 3 and 24 months. There would be persistent joint pain, due to loosening of the implant. The mode of infection is during the implant surgery. Common bacteria are coagulase-negative &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;.
* Late – more than 24 months. It is usually presented with a sudden onset of joint pain and fever. The mode of infection is through the bloodstream. The bacteria involved are the same as those in septic arthritis of a normal joint.

==Cause==
Septic arthritis is most commonly caused by a bacterial infection. Bacteria can enter the joint by:
* The bloodstream from an infection elsewhere (most common)
* Direct penetration into the joint (arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, trauma)
* A surrounding infection in the bone or tissue (uncommon, from osteomyelitis, septic bursitis, abscess)

Microorganisms in the blood may come from infections elsewhere in the body such as wound infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis or endocarditis. Sometimes, the infection comes from an unknown location. Joints with preexisting arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are especially prone to bacterial arthritis spread through the blood. In addition, some treatments for rheumatoid arthritis can also increase a person&#x27;s risk by causing an immunocompromised state. Intravenous drug use can cause endocarditis that spreads bacteria in the bloodstream and subsequently causes septic arthritis. Bacteria can enter the joint directly from prior surgery, intraarticular injection, trauma or joint prosthesis.

=== Risk factors ===
In children, although septic arthritis occurs in healthy children and adolescents with no co-occurring health issues, there are certain risk factors that may increase the likelihood of acquiring septic arthritis. For example, children with renal osteodystrophy or renal bone disease, certain hematological disorders and diseases causing immune suppression are risk factors for childhood septic arthritis.

The rate of septic arthritis varies from 4 to 29 cases per 100,000 person-years, depending on the underlying medical condition and the joint characteristics. For those with a septic joint, 85% of the cases have an underlying medical condition while 59% of them had a previous joint disorder. Having more than one risk factor greatly increases risk of septic arthritis.
* Age over 80 years
* Diabetes mellitus
* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis. Risk of septic arthritis increases with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment.
* Immunosuppressive medication
* Intravenous drug abuse
* Recent joint surgery
* Hip or knee prosthesis and skin infection
* HIV infection
* Other causes of sepsis

=== Organisms ===
Most cases of septic arthritis involve only one organism; however, polymicrobial infections can occur, especially after large open injuries to the joint. Septic arthritis is usually caused by bacteria, but may be caused by viral, mycobacterial, and fungal pathogens as well. It can be broadly classified into three groups: non-gonococcal arthritis, gonococcal arthritis, and others.
* Non-gonococcal arthritis – These bacteria account for over 80% of septic arthritis cases and are usually staphylococci or streptococci. Such infections most commonly come from drug abuse, cellulitis, abscesses, endocarditis, and chronic osteomyelitis. Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) may affect 5 to 25% of the cases while gram negative bacilli affects 14 to 19% of the septic arthritis cases. Gram negative infections are usually acquired through urinary tract infections, drug abuse, and skin infections. Older people who are immunocompromised are also prone to get gram negative infections. Common gram negative organisms are: &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Both gram positive and gram negative infections are commonly spread through the blood from an infective source; but can be introduced directly into the joint or from surrounding tissue. It often affects older people, and often happens suddenly, involving only one joint. Joint aspiration cultures are positive in 90% of cases, while only 50% of blood cultures yield any organisms.
* Gonococcal arthritis – &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; is a common cause of septic arthritis in people who are sexually active and under 40 years old. The bacteria is spread through the blood to the joint following sexual transmission. Other symptoms of disseminated gonococcal infection can include migration of joint pain, tenosynovitis and dermatitis. Synovial fluid cultures are positive in 25 to 70% of the cases while blood cultures are seldom positive. Apart from blood and joint cultures, swabs from urethra, rectum, pharynx, and cervix should also be taken. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is another useful way of identifying gonococcal infections if diagnosis is difficult and clinical presentation is similar to reactive arthritis.
* Others – Fungal and mycobacterial infections are rare causes of septic arthritis and usually have a slow onset of joint symptoms. Mycobacterial joint infection most commonly affects hip and knee joints, caused by reactivation of past mycobacterial infections, with or without signs and symptoms of tuberculosis in lungs. Synovial fluid cultures will be positive in 80% of the cases. However, acid fast smears are not useful. Histology is not specific to myocobacterial infection as there are other granulomatous diseases that can show similar histology. &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, a bacterium that causes lyme disease, can affect multiple large joints such as the knee. Confirmation of Lyme disease is done through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by confirmation using Western Blot test. It cannot be cultured from synovial fluid. However, PCR testing yields 85% positive result from synovial fluid. Viruses such as rubella, parvovirus B19, chikungunya, and HIV infection can also cause septic arthritis.
* Prosthetic joint infection – Artificial joint infection are usually caused by coagulase negative Staphylococci, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and gram negative bacilli. Concurrent infections by multiple organisms is also reported in 20% of the cases. The risk factors of prosthetic joint infections are: previous fracture, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, revision arthroplasty, and surgical site infections.

==== List of organisms ====
* &quot;Staphylococci&quot; (40%)
** &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; – the most common cause in most age groups. Can be caused by skin infection, previously damaged joint, prosthetic joint or intravenous drug use.
** &quot;coagulase-negative staphylococci&quot; – usually due to prosthetic joint
* &quot;Streptococci&quot; – the second-most common cause (28%)
** &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; – a common cause in children under 5
** &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;
** Group B streptococci – a common cause in infants
* &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;
* &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; – the most common cause of septic arthritis in young, sexually active adults. Multiple macules or vesicles seen over the trunk are a pathognomonic feature.
* &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; – in the elderly, IV drug users and the seriously ill
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; – IV drug users or penetrating trauma through the shoe
* &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, &quot;Salmonella spp.&quot; and &quot;Brucella spp.&quot; – cause septic spinal arthritis
* &quot;Eikenella corrodens&quot; – human bites
* &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot;, &quot;bartonella henselae&quot;, &quot;capnocytophaga – animal bites or scratches
* Fungal species – immunocompromised state
* &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; – ticks, causes lyme disease
* &quot;Spirillum minus&quot;, &quot;Streptobacillus moniliformis&quot; – rat bites

==Diagnosis==

Septic arthritis should be considered whenever a person has rapid onset pain in a swollen joint, regardless of fever. One or multiple joints can be affected at the same time.

Laboratory studies such as blood cultures, white blood cell count with differential, ESR, and CRP should also be included. However, white cell count, ESR, and CRP are nonspecific and could be elevated due to infection elsewhere in the body. Serologic studies should be done if lyme disease is suspected. Blood cultures can be positive in 25 to 50% of those with septic arthritis due to spread of infection from the blood. CRP more than 20 mg/L and ESR greater than 20 mm/hour together with typical signs and symptoms of septic arthritis should prompt arthrocentesis from the affected joint for synovial fluid examination.

The synovial fluid should be collected before the administration of antibiotics and should be sent for gram stain, culture, leukocyte count with differential, and crystal studies. This can include NAAT testing for &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; if suspected in a sexually active person.

In children, the Kocher criteria is used for diagnosis of septic arthritis.

==Differential diagnosis==
The differential diagnosis of septic arthritis is broad and challenging. First, it has to be differentiated from acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. This is because the treatment lines of both conditions are not identical. Noteworthy, septic arthritis and acute hematogenous osteomyelitis can co-occur. Especially in the hip and shoulder joints their co-occurrence is likely and represents a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, physicians should have a high suspicion index in that regard. This is because in both the hip and shoulder joints the metaphysis is intra-articular which in turn facilitates the spread of hematogenous osteomyelitis into the joint cavity. Conversely, joint sepsis may spread to the metaphysis and induce osteomyelitis.
Acute exacerbation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip both of which are non-septic conditions may mimic septic arthritis. More serious and life-threatening disorders as bone malignancies e.g. Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma may mimic septic arthritis associated with concurrent acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. In this regard, Magnetic resonance imaging may play an important role in the differential diagnosis.

=== Joint aspiration ===
In children, joint synovial fluid aspiration techniques aim at isolating the infectious organism by culture and sensitivity analysis. Cytological analysis of the joint aspirate can point to septic arthritis. However, a negative culture and sensitivity test does not rule out the presence of septic arthritis. Various clinical scenarios and technique-related factors may impact the validity of results of the culture and sensitivity. Additionally, results of cytological analysis, though important, should not be interpreted in isolation of the clinical settings.

In the joint fluid, the typical white blood cell count in septic arthritis is over 50,000–100,000 cells per 10−6/l (50,000–100,000 cell/mm3); where more than 90% are neutrophils is suggestive of septic arthritis. For those with prosthetic joints, white cell count more than 1,100 per mm3 with neutrophil count greater than 64% is suggestive of septic arthritis. However, septic synovial fluid can have white blood cell counts as low as a few thousand in the early stages. Therefore, differentiation of septic arthritis from other causes is not always possible based on cell counts alone. Synovial fluid PCR analysis is useful in finding less common organisms such as &quot;Borrelia&quot; species. However, measuring protein and glucose levels in joint fluid is not useful for diagnosis.

The Gram stain can rule in the diagnosis of septic arthritis, however, cannot exclude it.

Synovial fluid cultures are positive in over 90% of nongonoccocal arthritis; however, it is possible for the culture to be negative if the person received antibiotics prior to the joint aspiration. Cultures are usually negative in gonoccocal arthritis or if fastidious organisms are involved.

If the culture is negative or if a gonococcal cause is suspected, NAAT testing of the synovial fluid should be done.

Positive crystal studies do not rule out septic arthritis. Crystal-induced arthritis such as gout can occur at the same time as septic arthritis.

A lactate level in the synovial fluid of greater than 10 mmol/L makes the diagnosis very likely.

===Blood tests===
Laboratory testing includes white blood cell count, ESR and CRP. These values are usually elevated in those with septic arthritis; however, these can be elevated by other infections or inflammatory conditions and are, therefore, nonspecific. Procalcitonin may be more useful than CRP.

Blood cultures can be positive in up to half of people with septic arthritis.

===Imaging===
Imaging such as x-ray, CT, MRI or ultrasound are nonspecific. They can help determine areas of inflammation but cannot confirm septic arthritis.

When septic arthritis is suspected, x-rays should generally be taken. This is used to assess any problems in the surrounding structures such as bone fractures, chondrocalcinosis, and inflammatory arthritis which may predispose to septic arthritis. While x-rays may not be helpful early in the diagnosis/treatment, they may show subtle increase in joint space and tissue swelling. Later findings include joint space narrowing due to destruction of the joint.

Ultrasound is effective at detecting joint effusions.

CT and MRI are not required for diagnosis; but if the diagnosis is unclear or the joints are hard to examine (ie.sacroiliac or hip joints); they can help to assess for inflammation/infection in or around the joint (i.e. Osteomyelitis), bone erosions, and bone marrow oedema. Both CT and MRI scans are helpful in guiding arthrocentesis of the joints.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
* Crystal induced arthritis such as gout or pseudogout
* Inflammatory arthritis
** Rheumatoid arthritis
** Seronegative spondyloarthropathy such as ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis
* Traumatic arthritis due to hemarthrosis, fracture or foreign body
* Osteoarthritis

== Treatment ==
Treatment is usually with intravenous antibiotics, analgesia and washout and/or aspiration of the joint. Draining the pus from the joint is important and can be done either by needle (arthrocentesis) or opening the joint surgically (arthrotomy).

Empiric antibiotics for suspected bacteria should be started. This should be based on Gram stain of the synovial fluid as well as other clinical findings. General guidelines are as follows:
* Gram positive cocci – vancomycin
* Gram negative cocci – Ceftriaxone
* Gram negative bacilli – Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime
* Gram stain negative and immunocompetent – vancomycin
* Gram stain negative and immunocompromised – vancomycin + third generation cephalosphorin
* IV drug use (possible pseudomonas aeruginosa) – ceftazidime +/- an aminoglycoside

Once cultures are available, antibiotics can be changed to target the specific organism. After a good response to intravenous antibiotics, people can be switched to oral antibiotics. The duration of oral antibiotics varies, but is generally for 1–4 weeks depending on the offending organism. Repeated daily joint aspiration is useful in the treatment of septic arthritis. Every aspirate should be sent for culture, gram stain, white cell count to monitor the progress of the disease. Both open surgery and arthroscopy are helpful in the drainage of the infected joint. During surgery, lysis of the adhesions, drainage of pus, and debridement of the necrotic tissues are done. Close follow up with physical exam &amp; labs must be done to make sure the person is no longer feverish, pain has resolved, has improved range of motion, and lab values are normalized.

In infection of a prosthetic joint, a biofilm is often created on the surface of the prosthesis which is resistant to antibiotics. Surgical debridement is usually indicated in these cases. A replacement prosthesis is usually not inserted at the time of removal to allow antibiotics to clear infection of the region. People that cannot have surgery may try long-term antibiotic therapy in order to suppress the infection. The use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental, genitourinary, gastrointestinal procedures to prevent infection of the implant is controversial.

Low-quality evidence suggests that the use of corticosteroids may reduce pain and the number of days of antibiotic treatment in children.

== Outcomes ==
Risk of permanent impairment of the joint varies greatly. This usually depends on how quickly treatment is started after symptoms occur as longer lasting infections cause more destruction to the joint. The involved organism, age, preexisting arthritis, and other comorbidities can also increase this risk. Gonococcal arthritis generally does not cause long term impairment. For those with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; septic arthritis, 46 to 50% of the joint function returns after completing antibiotic treatment. In pneumococcal septic arthritis, 95% of the joint function will return if the person survives. One-third of people are at risk of functional impairment (due to amputation, arthrodesis, prosthetic surgery, and deteriorating joint function) if they have an underlying joint disease or a synthetic joint implant. Mortality rates generally range from 10 to 20%. These rates increase depending on the offending organism, advanced age, and comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis.

== Epidemiology ==
In children and adolescence septic arthritis and acute hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs in about 1.34 to 82 per 100,000 per annual hospitalization rates. In adults septic arthritis occurs in about 5 people per 100,000 each year. It occurs more commonly in older people. With treatment, about 15% of people die, while without treatment 66% die.

<doc id="546885" wikidata="Q7248919" url="?curid=546885" title="Prohibitions in Sikhism">
<text>Adherents of Sikhism follow a number of prohibitions. As with any followers of any faith or group, adherence varies by each individual.

== Prohibitions ==
These prohibitions are strictly followed by initiated Khalsa Sikhs who have undergone initiation. While the Sikh gurus did not enforce religion and did not believe in forcing people to follow any particular religion in general, the Sikh community does encourage all people to become better individuals by following the Guru&#x27;s Advice (Gurmatta), as opposed to living life without the Guru&#x27;s code of disciple (Man-mat):

4 major transgressions:
* Hair removal – Hair cutting, trimming, removing, shaving, plucking, threading, dyeing, or any other alteration from any body part is strictly forbidden.
* Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the Muslim or Jewish way (Kutha meat). This is the absolute minimum required by all initiated Sikhs. Although lacto vegetarianism is practiced and recommended by some Sikhs, many Sikhs refrain from eating non-vegetarian food, and believe all should follow this diet. This is due to various social, cultural, political, and familial aspects. As such, there has always been major disagreement among Sikhs over the issue of eating non-vegetarian food. Sikhs following the Rehat (Code of Conduct) of the Damdami Taksal &amp; Akhand Kirtani Jatha also subscribe to this view. The Akali Nihangs have traditionally eaten meat and are famous for performing Jhatka. Thus, there is a wide range of views that exist on the issue of a proper &quot;Sikh diet&quot; in the Panth. Nonetheless, all Sikhs agree with the minimum consensus that meat slaughtered via the Muslim (Halal), Jewish (Shechita) methods or any other religiously slaughtered way, is strictly against Sikh principles. The Akal Takht represents the final authority on controversial issues concerning the Sikh Panth (community or collective). The Hukamnama (edict or clarification), issued by Akal Takht Jathedar Sadhu Singh Bhaura dated February 15, 1980, states that eating meat does not go against the code of conduct of the Sikhs. Amritdhari Sikhs can eat meat as long as it is Jhatka meat.
* Adultery: Cohabiting with a person other than one&#x27;s spouse (sexual relations with anyone who you are not married to- originally a prohibition on sexual intercourse with Muslim women, an injunction was made by Guru Gobind Singh not to seize them during warfare as sexual contact with them was seen as polluting. Kahn Singh Nabha of the Singh Sabha Movement had later inferred that the Guru&#x27;s command was construed as a prohibition on intercourse with a woman other than one&#x27;s wife.)
* Intoxicants – A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, cocaine, narcotics, etc. In short, any intoxicant is not allowed. Cannabis is generally prohibited, but ritually consumed in edible form by some Sikhs. Some Sikh groups, like the Damdami Taksal, are even opposed to drinking caffeine in Indian tea. Indian tea is almost always served in Sikh gurudwaras around the world. Some Akali Nihang groups consume cannabis-containing shaheedi degh (), purportedly to help in meditation.&quot;Sūkha parshaad&quot; (), &quot;Dry-sweet&quot;, is the term Akali Nihangs use to refer to it. It was traditionally crushed and consumed as a liquid, especially during festivals like Hola Mohalla. It is never smoked, as this practice is forbidden in Sikhism. In 2001, Jathedar Santa Singh, the leader of Budha Dal, along with 20 chiefs of Nihang sects, refused to accept the ban on consumption of &quot; shaheedi degh&quot; by the apex Sikh clergy of Akal Takht - in order to preserve their traditional practices. According to a recent BBC article, &quot;Traditionally they also drank shaheedi degh, an infusion of cannabis, to become closer with God&quot;. Baba Santa Singh was excommunicated and replaced with Baba Balbir Singh, who agreed to shun the consumption of &quot;bhang&quot;.

Other mentioned practices to be avoided, as per the Sikh Rehat Maryada:
* Piercing of the nose or ears for wearing ornaments is forbidden for Sikh men and women.
* Female infanticide: A Sikh should not kill his daughter; nor should he maintain any relationship with a killer of daughter.
* A Sikh shall not steal, form dubious associations or engage in gambling.
* It is not proper for a Sikh woman to wear a veil that covers the face or have the face hidden.
* Sikhs cannot wear any token of other faiths. Sikhs must not have their head bare or wear caps. They also cannot wear any ornaments piercing through any part of the body.
* Hereditary priestly class – Sikhism does not have priests, as they were abolished by Guru Gobind Singh (the 10th Guru of Sikhism). The only position he left was a Granthi to look after the Guru Granth Sahib; any Sikh is free to become Granthi or read from the Guru Granth Sahib.
* Blind spirituality: Idolatry, superstitions, and rituals should not be observed or followed, including pilgrimages, fasting, and ritual purification; circumcision; ancestor worship; grave worship; and compulsory wearing of the veil for women. Observation of the five Ks, however, is not considered blind superstition, as they are intended to help Sikhs in their everyday life.
* Material obsession: Obsession with material wealth is not encouraged in Sikhism.
* Sacrifice of creatures: Animal sacrifice to celebrate holy occasions are forbidden.
* Non-family-oriented living: Sikhs are discouraged from living as a recluse, beggar, yogi/yogini, monastic (monk/nun), or celibate.
* Worthless talk: Bragging, gossip, lying, slander, &quot;backstabbing,&quot; et cetera, are not permitted. The Guru Granth Sahib tells the Sikh, &quot;your mouth has not stopped slandering and gossiping about others. Your service is useless and fruitless.&quot;

<text>Berat County (; ), officially the County of Berat (), is a county in the Southern Region of the Republic of Albania. It is the ninth largest by area and the ninth most populous of the twelve counties, with around 140,956 people within an area of . The county borders the counties of Elbasan to the north, Korçë to the east, Gjirokastër to the south and Fier to the west. It is divided into five municipalities, Berat, Dimal, Kuçovë, Poliçan and Skrapar, with all of whom incorporate twenty-five administrative units.

== History ==

Archaeologists have found artifacts including silver women&#x27;s earrings and bronze belt-buckles in Bronze Age tumuli in Pëllumbas, one of the villages of Berat. These items are similar to other artifacts found in northern Albania (Kukës and Mat), Kosovo (Gjilan) and northwestern Greece (Pogoni).

Antipatrea () was an ancient Greek polis in Illyria, now Berat. It was founded by Cassander as Antipatreia, who named it after his father Antipater at 314 BC. An ancient Greek fortress and settlement are still visible today. Dassaretae tribe existed in the area, as early as the 6th century BC. It was captured by the Romans in the 2nd century BC. Livy (31.27.2) describes Antipatrea as a strongly fortified city in a narrow pass that the Romans sacked and burned. The city was composed of two fortifications on both banks of the Osum River.

Historical manuscripts such as the 6th century Codex Purpureus Beratinus, discovered in 1868, and the Codex Aureus, a 9th-century Greek language manuscript have revealed much about the history of the region and that Berat had a reputation for producing manuscripts; 76 of the 100 codes protected in the National Archives of Albania are from Berat, indicating its historical importance.

The town of Berat became part of the unstable frontier of the Byzantine Empire following the fall of the Roman Empire and, along with much of the rest of the Balkan peninsula, it suffered from repeated invasions by Slavs and other tribes. During the Byzantine period, it was known as Pulcheriopolis.

The Bulgarians under Simeon I captured the town in the 9th century and renamed it Beligrad (White City). They were eventually driven out in the 11th century. During the 13th century, it fell to Michael I Ducas, the ruler of the Despotate of Epirus.
In the latter part of the 13th century, Berat again came under the control of the Byzantine Empire. In 1272 Berat was captured by the forces of the Kingdom of Albania, while Michael VIII Palaiologos sent letters to the Albanian leaders of Berat and Durrës asking them to abandon their alliance with Charles I of Naples; they sent the letters to Charles as a sign of their loyalty.

In 1274 Michael VIII recaptured Berat and after being joined by Albanians, who supported the Byzantine Empire marched unsuccessfully against the Angevin capital of Durrës.

In 1280–1281, the Sicilian forces under Hugh the Red of Sully laid siege to Berat. In March 1281, a relief force from Constantinople under the command of Michael Tarchaneiotes was able to drive off the besieging Sicilian army. In 1335–1337, Albanian tribes took control of the area between Berat and Vlorë for the first time, that time the Muzakaj formed the Lordship of Berat. Serbs took control of the area in 1345. Later, it passed back into the hands of Muzaka, restoring the Lordship, until 1450.

The Ottoman Empire conquered it in 1450 from the Muzaka family. Skanderbeg&#x27;s Albanian forces unsuccessfully besieged the fort in 1455. It remained under Ottoman control until 1912, when it became part of Albania. Ali Pasha (born 1744-died 1822), an Ottoman Albanian ruler, took control of Berat between 1788 and 1822, as a semi-autonomous ruler. His domain was called the Pashalik of Yanina. He refortified the city in 1809. In 1867, Berat became a sanjak in the Janina (Yanya) vilayet. During Ottoman rule, it was known Arnavut Belgradı in Turkish (meaning &quot;Albanian Belgrade&quot;) at first and then Berat.

During the early period of Ottoman rule, Berat fell into severe decline. By the end of the 16th century, it had only 710 houses. However, it began to recover by the 17th century and became a major craft centre in the Ottoman Balkans, specializing in wood carving. During the 19th century, Berat played an important part in the Albanian national revival. It became a major base of support for the League of Prizren, the late 19th century organisation which was pro-Albanian independence.

Between 1912 and 1914, it was under the control of the Albanian provisional government, and controlled by the Principality of Albania between 1914 and 1915. It was occupied by the Allies in 1915 during the First World War, despite Albania&#x27;s neutrality, before falling to Austro-Hungarian forces in 1916. Austria-Hungary sustained the occupation until 1918, after which it was occupied by Italy. Italy had plans to create an autonomous province over Albania, including the area of Berat. However, following the defeat of Italy in the Vlora War, Albania retook control of Berat. Italy again occupied Berat in 1939 during the Italian invasion of Albania. Following Italy&#x27;s capitulation, Germany occupied Albania between 1943 and 1944. In November 1944, the communist-controlled Anti-Fascist National Liberation Council of Albania declared in Berat that it was the provisional government of the country, signalling the beginning of the Enver Hoxha dictatorship. Communist Albania retained control over Albania for many decades, until finally falling in 1992. Berat has since then been part of the Republic of Albania.

== Geography ==

Berat is one of 12 counties of Albania, located in the north of the Southern Region. The county lies about 300 metres up to 2400 metres above sea level. It lies between latitudes 41° N, and longitudes 20° E. The county area is and the ninth unit of the Albanian county in area and the fifth in the Southern Region. Alone among the counties, Berat neither borders the sea nor another country. It is limited to the counties of Elbasan to the north, Korçë tn the east, Gjirokastër to the south and Fier to the west.

The physical relief of the south of the county is dominated by Tomorr massif (known as the Throne of Gods) and Mount Shpirag. Standing at above sea level, the mountain is one of the highest points in Southern Albania. A deep ravine cut by the Osum river on Tomorrs west side, which is deep in a limestone formation, is where Berat is situated on stepped terraces. The north is comprised mostly by lowlands and the Myzeqe plain. The valley of the Osum river flowing from southeast to the northwest becomes also wider.

The county is home to the source of the Seman river. The river originates close to Kuçovë at the confluence of the Osum and Devoll rivers. The Osum river flows through the Osum canyon and the city of Berat, where the river has formed the narrow Gorica gorge. The river banks tend to be densely forested. Other notable rivers include the Çorovoda river, passing through the town of Çorovodë.
The geographical formations of the region are frequently mentioned in local folklore. According to legend, Tomorr personified a giant who fought his brother Shpirag, personified by a nearby mountain, for the love of a young woman. The two brothers fought bitterly for her affections and ended up killing each other. Deep in sorrow, the legend states, the grieving woman for whom they had contested wept over their deaths; her tears created the Osum river. She was then said to have turned to stone, becoming the foundation on which Berat Castle is now built. Both Tomorr and Shpirag are visible from the city of Berat.

The county experiences a Mediterranean climate. This means that the winters are mild and wet and the summers are hot and dry but it vary by local topography. There are diverse microclimates in the county such as alpine climate. Summers are generally dry while heavy rains are experienced during the winter. Climate conditions near Berat are conducive to farming and related agricultural industries. Mean monthly temperature ranges between (in January) and (in July).

== Culture ==


The main religions in Berat are Islam and Christianity. The landscape of a mixture of minarets of mosques and grand orthodox churches and chapels are a testament to the religious coexistence of Berat inhabitants. In the Middle Ages, Berat was the seat of a Greek Orthodox Bishpric, and today Aromanian and even Greek speakers can be found in the city and some surrounding villages. In 2008, Berat was added to UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage list as an example of the coexistence of religions and cultures.

The Saint Mary of Blachernae Church dates back to the 13th century and contains 16th century mural paintings by Nikola, son of the Albania&#x27;s most famous medieval painter Onufri. The first inscription recording Onufri&#x27;s name was found in 1951 in the Shelqan church. The Kastoria church dates to 23 July 1547 and has a reference to Onufri&#x27;s origin: &quot;I am Onufri, and come from the town of Berat.&quot; Onufri&#x27;s style in painting was inherited by his son, Nikola (Nicholas), though not so successful as his father. Onufri&#x27;s museum contains works of Onufri, Nikola and other painters. There is also a number of icons and some fine examples of religious silversmith&#x27;s work (sacred vessels, icon casings, covers of Gospel books, etc.). Berat Gospels, which date from the 4th century, are copies (the originals are preserved in the National Archives in Tirana). The church itself has a magnificent iconostasis of carved wood, with two very fine icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The bishop&#x27;s throne and pulpit are also of considerable quality.
Near the street which descends from the fortress is the Bachelors&#x27; Mosque (), built in 1827. It has an attractive portico and an interesting external decoration of flowers, plants, and houses. The King Mosque (), the oldest in the town built in the reign of Bayazid II (1481–1512), is notable for its fine ceiling. The Lead Mosque (), built in 1555 and so called from the covering of its cupola. This mosque is the centre of the town. The Halveti Teqe () of 1790 is a khanqah (or zawiya) of the Khalwati Sufi order. It has a porch and a carved and gilded ceiling. Near of tekke is purported to be the grave of Shabbatai Zevi, a Turkish Jew who had been banished to Dulcigno (present day Ulcinj) who created controversy among his followers upon his conversion to Islam. Folk music culture exists in Berat County and the performers often wear traditional dress.

== History ==

Human activity in the territory of the modern Dibër County can be traced back to the Neolithic.

In the Middle Ages, Dibër was part of the Principality of Kastrioti ruled by the royal Kastrioti family with Gjon Kastrioti on the Albanian throne. After the death of Gjon Kastrioti in 1437, the eastern region was annexed by the Ottomans and became seat of the Sanjak of Dibra. The comprising regions were awarded to his son Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg, where he survived to conquer back his father’s land and unite all of Albania in 1444. In the 15th century, further during the Albanian wars the region was the frontier between the Ottomans and the League of Lezhë.

In the 19th century, the Congress of Dibër declared the Albanian language as an official language within the Ottoman Empire. After the Balkan Wars and following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the great powers established the borders of the Balkan states at the Conference of London. The Dibër Valley was cut in half. The western part was assigned to Albania, while the eastern part went to the Kingdom of Serbia, today North Macedonia.

<doc id="546906" wikidata="Q6095720" url="?curid=546906" title="Mufti Mohammad Sayeed">
<text>Mufti Mohammad Sayeed (12 January 19367 January 2016; Urdu: مفتی محمد سید) was an Indian politician who served as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir twice from November 2002 to November 2005 and from March 2015 until his death on January 7, 2016. He held various positions, including minister of Tourism in Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet and minister of Home Affairs in V. P. Singh&#x27;s cabinet. Sayeed began his political career in the wing of the National Conference led by G. M. Sadiq, which later merged with the Indian National Congress. In 1987, he transitioned to the Janata Dal and subsequently founded the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP), a regional political party that remains influential in Jammu and Kashmir, currently led by his daughter, Mehbooba Mufti.

==Early life==
Sayeed was born on 12 January 1936, in Bijbehara, Anantnag district, then part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, British India, into a Kashmiri Shia Muslim clerical family. He completed his basic studies in Srinagar and earned his law and postgraduate degree in Arabic from Aligarh Muslim University before entering politics.

His daughter, Mehbooba Mufti, is a politician and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.

==Political party affiliations==
Sayeed started his political career in the 1950s in the Democratic National Conference, a splinter group of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference led by Ghulam Mohammed Sadiq. He was appointed as the district convenor of the party, which merged back into the National Conference in late 1960.

In 1962, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly from Bijbehara. After G. M. Sadiq became the chief minister of the state in 1964, Sayeed was appointed as a deputy minister in his government.

In January 1965, the National Conference merged into the Indian National Congress. Thus Sayeed became a member of Congress.

In 1972, Sayeed became a cabinet minister and, the president of the state Congress unit. He joined the Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s government in 1986 as minister of Tourism. In 1987, he quit the Congress party to join V. P. Singh&#x27;s Jan Morcha, which led to him becoming the first Muslim minister for Home Affairs in the Union Cabinet of India for one year, from 1989 to 1990.

He rejoined the Congress under P. V. Narasimha Rao, which he left in 1999 along with his daughter Mehbooba Mufti to form his own party, the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party.

==Political career ==
===Chief Minister: First tenure (2002–2005)===
Sayeed participated in the 2002 assembly election and won 18 assembly seats for his Peoples Democratic Party. He went on to form a coalition government with the Indian National Congress, and was sworn in as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir for a term of three years.

In 2003, he merged the autonomous Special Operations Group with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. It was under his tenure which coincided with the peace process led by Indian prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh and Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, with LOC opened for trade and bus service.

===Chief Minister: Second tenure (2015–2016)===

In the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, the PDP emerged as the single largest party, though it fell short of a majority. Following a coalition agreement between the BJP and the PDP, Sayeed started his second tenure as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir in 2015.

===Union Minister for Home Affairs===
In 1989, within few days of taking office as the Union Minister for Home Affairs, his third daughter, Rubaiya, was kidnapped in 1989. Under pressure, she was released from captivity. During his tenure as Home Minister of India the Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus took place.

==Attacks on his family and himself==

Besides attacks on family members Sayeed also survived attacks on his life by Kashmiri separatists. His daughter Rubaiya Sayeed was also kidnapped on 9 December 1989.

==Death==

On 24 December 2015, Sayeed was admitted to the AIIMS hospital in New Delhi. He suffered from neck pain and fever. His condition gradually deteriorated, and he was put on ventilator support. He died on 7 January 2016 due to multi-organ failure at about 7:30, according to provincial Education Minister and PDP Spokesman Nayeem Akhter. He was just five days short of his 80th birthday when he died.

Reactions to this death came from prime minister Narendra Modi, national Home Minister Rajnath Singh at Delhi airport and the 14th Dalai Lama. He was buried at his ancestral burial ground in Bijbehera with state honours. Former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Azad were present at his funeral. Condolences also came from former president Pranab Mukherjee, former deputy prime minister L. K. Advani, Ram Madhav, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, BJP vice president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, former national Oil minister Milind Deora, PDP member Rafi Mir and politicians Kalraj Mishra, Jitendra Singh and Ahmed Patel.

According to party member and PDP chief spokesperson Mirza Mehboob Beg, the PDP supported his daughter, Mehbooba Mufti, as the next chief minister, while coalition ally BJP expressed &quot;no objection&quot; to her succeeding her father.

Sayeed was buried in Dara Shikoh Garden Bijbehara.

<text>Tirana County (), officially the County of Tirana (), is a county in the Central Region of Albania. It is the tenth largest by area and the most populous of the twelve counties, with more than 912,000 people within an area of . The county borders on the Adriatic Sea to the west, the counties of Durrës to the northwest, Dibër to the northeast, Elbasan to the east and Fier to the southwest. It is divided into five municipalities, Tirana, Kamëz, Kavajë, Rrogozhinë and Vorë, with all of whom incorporate twenty-nine administrative units.

Geographically, Tirana extends from the high and rugged Skanderbeg Mountains in the east to the flat shores of the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast along the Mediterranean Sea. Due to its location and the close proximity to the Adriatic Sea, its climate is particularly influenced by a Mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons. Two of the country&#x27;s fourteen National Parks are located in the county, with Dajti in the center and Divjakë-Karavasta in the southwest.
Historically, Tirana has been populated since Paleolithic times dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years ago. As argued by various archaeologists, the populated places are filled with Ancient Illyrian toponyms, as its precincts are some of the earliest regions in Albania to be inhabited. Nevertheless, the city of Tirana was established as a city centuries later in 1614 during the Ottoman occupation of Albania.

The capital of the county is Tirana, which is also the largest city by area and population in Albania. A gamma-world-city, it is the most influential economic and political center of the country.

== History ==

=== Pre-Albanian Independence===
The region, which presently corresponds to the territory of the county of Tirana, has been continuously inhabited since the Paleolithic some 10,000 to 30,000 years ago, as suggested by evidence from tools excavated near Mount Dajt&#x27;s quarry and within the Cave of Pëllumbas. As argued by various archaeologists, Tirana and its suburbs are filled with Illyrian toponyms, as its precincts are some of the earliest inhabited regions in Albania.

The oldest discovery in downtown Tirana was a Roman house, later transformed into an aisleless church with a mosaic-floor, dating to the 3rd century A.D., with other remains found near a medieval temple at Shengjin Fountain in the eastern suburbs. A castle possibly called &quot;Tirkan&quot; or &quot;Theranda&quot;, whose remnants are found along Murat Toptani Street, was built by Emperor Justinian in 520 A.D. and restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century. The area had no special importance in Illyrian and classical times. In 1510, Marin Barleti, an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, in the biography of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg referred to this area as a small village.

== History ==
During Roman antiquity, the city of Vlorë, the homonymous county capital, was known as &quot;Aulón&quot; (, , meaning channel or glen in Greek, and possibly a translation of another indigenous name). The city was mentioned for the first time by Ptolemy (2nd century CE) among the towns of the Illyrian Taulantii.

The coastal area of Vlorë was one of those Illyrian sites that had experienced pre-urban activity beginning from the 11th–10th centuries BCE. In classical antiquity the Bay of Vlorë constituted the southern limit of the Illyrian coast. The coastal area of the Bay was settled by Ancient Greek colonists, who traditionally founded Oricum, Thronion and Aulon. The latter city, however, dates to the Roman period. but a large fortified port-town that was inhabited from the 6th century BCE to the 2nd century AD is placed, now partially submerged, in Triport, northwest of present-day Vlorë. Illyrians were found in the hinterland of the Bay. The Ceraunian Mountains represented a natural border between Illyria and Epirus. The area to the south of the mountains was inhabited by the Epirote tribe of the Chaonians. On the Epirote coast the Ancient Greeks developed the town of Sarandë, which they referred to as &quot;Onchesmos&quot; (or Anchiasmos). Onchesmos flourished as the port of the Chaonian capital of Phoenice (modern-day Finiq). Another Chaonian settlement was Chimera, identified with Himarë,

In the Middle Ages, the region was part of the Byzantine Empire, while during the Slavic invasion there is evidence that Byzantine rule was maintained in the area.

In 1204 the region became part of the Despotate of Epirus, but later returned to the Byzantine Empire. In 1335 Albanian tribes were in possession of the area between Berat and the bay of Vlorë, while in 1345 after the Serbian invasion an independent principality was formed in Vlorë.

In the middle of the 14th century the aristocratic Delvina family ruled Delvinë, and in 1354 Mehmet Ali Pasha Delvina was testified as the owner of the castle and the city.

The Ottoman Empire captured the region in 1417, while in 1432, Albanian rebels freed Vlorë and expelled the Ottomans from the area. As part of the Ottoman Empire, The region became a &quot;sanjak&quot; centre in Rumelia Eyalet under the name &quot;Avlonya&quot;.

On November 28, 1912, Ismail Kemal declared the Albanian National Awakening in Vlorë, during the First Balkan War. The region became Albania&#x27;s first freed region following its independence, but was invaded by Italy in december 1915, during World War I. The region remained occupied by Italian forces until an Albanian rebellion forced the Italians out of Albania in 1920. Italy invaded Vlorë again in 1939. The region remained under Italian occupation until Italy surrendered to the allies in 1943. Subsequently, Nazi Germany occupied the region until 1944. The city was liberated in 1944 by communist forces under Enver Hoxha.

During the World War II, Sazan Island became the site of a German and Italian submarine base and naval installations; these installations were heavily bombed by the Allies.

After World War II, with Albania ruled by a Communist Party, the port was leased out to the Soviet Union for use as a submarine base. During 1960 and 1961 it served as a theater in the aftermath of the decision of Enver Hoxha to denounce Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms. In April 1961 the Soviet Union, resenting being pushed out after considerable investment in the naval facilities at Pasha Liman Base, threatened to occupy the region with Soviet troops, and cut off all Soviet economic, military and technical aid to Albania.

<text>A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays.

Seven-segment displays are widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, basic calculators, and other electronic devices that display numerical information.

==History==
Seven-segment representation of figures can be found in patents as early as 1903 (in ), when Carl Kinsley invented a method of telegraphically transmitting letters and numbers and having them printed on tape in a segmented format. In 1908, F. W. Wood invented an 8-segment display, which displayed the number 4 using a diagonal bar (). In 1910, a seven-segment display illuminated by incandescent bulbs was used on a power-plant boiler room signal panel. They were also used to show the dialed telephone number to operators during the transition from manual to automatic telephone dialing. They did not achieve widespread use until the advent of LEDs in the 1970s.
Some early seven-segment displays used incandescent filaments in an evacuated bulb; they are also known as numitrons. A variation (minitrons) made use of an evacuated potted box. Minitrons are filament segment displays that are housed in DIP (dual in-line package) packages like modern LED segment displays. They may have up to 16 segments. There were also segment displays that used small incandescent light bulbs instead of LEDs or incandescent filaments. These worked similarly to modern LED segment displays.

Vacuum fluorescent display versions were also used in the 1970s.

Many early (c. 1970s) LED seven-segment displays had each digit built on a single die. This made the digits very small. Some included magnifying lenses in the design to try to make the digits more legible. Other designs used 1 or 2 dies for every segment of the display.

The seven-segment pattern is sometimes used in posters or tags, where the user either applies color to pre-printed segments, or applies color through a seven-segment digit template, to compose figures such as product prices or telephone numbers.

For many applications, dot-matrix liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) have largely superseded LED displays in general, though even in LCDs, seven-segment displays are common. Unlike LEDs, the shapes of elements in an LCD panel are arbitrary since they are formed on the display by photolithography. In contrast, the shapes of LED segments tend to be simple rectangles, because they have to be physically moulded to shape, which makes it difficult to form more complex shapes than the segments of seven-segment displays. However, the easy recognition of seven-segment displays, and the comparatively high visual contrast obtained by such displays relative to dot-matrix digits, makes seven-segment multiple-digit LCD screens very common on basic calculators.

The seven-segment display has inspired type designers to produce typefaces reminiscent of that display (but more legible), such as New Alphabet, &quot;DB LCD Temp&quot;, &quot;ION B&quot;, etc.

Using a restricted range of letters that look like (upside-down) digits, seven-segment displays are commonly used by school children to form words and phrases using a technique known as &quot;calculator spelling&quot;.

==Implementations==
Seven-segment displays may use a liquid-crystal display (LCD), a light-emitting diode (LED) for each segment, an electrochromic display, or other light-generating or -controlling techniques such as cold cathode gas discharge (neon) (Panaplex), vacuum fluorescent (VFD), incandescent filaments (Numitron), and others. For gasoline price totems and other large signs, electromechanical seven-segment displays made up of electromagnetically flipped light-reflecting segments are still commonly used. A precursor to the 7-segment display in the 1950s through the 1970s was the cold-cathode, neon-lamp-like nixie tube. Starting in 1970, RCA sold a display device known as the &quot;&quot; that used incandescent filaments arranged into a seven-segment display. In USSR, the first electronic calculator &quot;Vega&quot;, which was produced from 1964, contains 20 decimal digits with seven-segment electroluminescent display.

In a simple LED package, typically all of the cathodes (negative terminals) or all of the anodes (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a &quot;common cathode&quot; or &quot;common anode&quot; device. Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.

Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays to reduce the number of I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.

Although to a naked eye all digits of an LED display appear lit, only one digit is lit at any given time in a multiplexed display. The digit changes at a high enough rate that the human eye cannot see the flashing (on earlier devices it could be visible to peripheral vision).

==Characters==
The seven segments are arranged as a rectangle, with two vertical segments on each side and one horizontal segment each at the top, middle, and bottom. Often the rectangle is &quot;oblique&quot; (slanted), which may aid readability. In most applications, the segments are of nearly uniform shape and size (usually elongated hexagons, though trapezoids and rectangles can also be used); though in the case of adding machines, the vertical segments are longer and more oddly shaped at the ends, to try to make them more easily readable. The seven elements of the display can be lit in different combinations to represent each of the Arabic numerals.

The individual segments are referred to by the letters &quot;a&quot; to &quot;g&quot;, and an optional decimal point (an &quot;eighth segment&quot;, referred to as DP) is sometimes used for the display of non-integer numbers. A single byte can encode the full state of a seven-segment display, including the decimal point. The most popular bit encodings are &quot;gfedcba&quot; and &quot;abcdefg&quot;. In the &quot;gfedcba&quot; representation, a byte value of 0x06 would turn on segments &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, which would display a &quot;1&quot;.

===Decimal===
The numerical digits 0 to 9 are the most common characters displayed on seven-segment displays. The most common patterns used for each of these are:

Alternative patterns: The numeral 1 may be represented with the left segments, the numerals 6 and 9 may be represented without a &quot;tail&quot;, and the numeral 7 represented &quot;with&quot; a &#x27;tail&#x27;:

In Unicode 13.0, 10 codepoints had been given for segmented digits 0–9 in the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, to replicate early computer fonts that included seven-segment versions of the digits. The official reference shows the less-common four-segment &quot;7&quot;.

===Hexadecimal===
The binary-coded decimal (BCD) 0 to 9 digit values require four binary bits to hold their values. Since four bits (24) can hold 16 values, this means hexadecimal (hex) digits can be represented by four bits too. Since there are a limited number of segments in seven-segment displays, a couple of the hexadecimal digits are required to be displayed as lowercase letters, otherwise the uppercase letter &quot;B&quot; would be the same as the digit &quot;8&quot;, and the uppercase letter &quot;D&quot; would be the same as the digit &quot;0&quot;. The digit &quot;6&quot; must also be displayed with the topmost segment as to avoid ambiguity with the letter &quot;b&quot;.

Early decoder IC&#x27;s often produced random patterns or duplicates of digits for 10-15, as they were designed to use as few gates as possible and only required to produce 0-9.

===Letters===
Many letters of the latin alphabet can be reasonably implemented on a seven-segment display. Though not every letter is available, it is possible to create many useful words. By careful choice of words, one can sometimes work around unavailable letters. Uppercase letters &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; conflict with the common seven-segment representation of digits &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, 5&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and the lowercase letter &quot;g&quot; with digit &quot;9&quot;. Upper case could be put on the left (as lower-case L is shown here) but this is not often done. Lowercase &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;q&#x27; are identical to the alternate numerical digits &#x27;6&#x27; and &#x27;9&#x27;.

The following are some real world English word examples seen on actual electronic equipment (first line appeared on some CD players):

There are also fourteen- and sixteen-segment displays (for full s); however, these have mostly been replaced by dot matrix displays. 22-segment displays capable of displaying the full ASCII character set were briefly available in the early 1980s but did not prove popular.

<doc id="546941" wikidata="Q6809265" url="?curid=546941" title="Mehbooba Mufti">
<text>Mehbooba Mufti Sayed (Urdu: محبوبہ مفتی سید; born 22 May 1959) is an Indian politician and leader of the Jammu and Kashmir People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP), who served as the 9th and last chief minister of the erstwhile state Jammu and Kashmir from 4 April 2016 to 19 June 2018. She was the first female chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. After the revocation of Article 370 of the constitution in August 2019, Mufti was detained without any charges at first and later under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.

Mufti is the first woman to hold the office of chief minister in the Jammu and Kashmir. She formed a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir jointly with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She resigned in June 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition.

Mufti was the president of the PDP and was a member of the Indian parliament, representing Anantnag in the 16th Lok Sabha before she was sworn in as the chief minister of the Jammu and Kashmir. She also represented Anantnag in the 14th Lok Sabha (2004–09) and has also been a Leader of Opposition in Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly.

==Early life==

She is the daughter of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Gulshan Ara, born in 1959 in Akhran Nowpora, J&amp;K, India. She graduated in English literature from Government College for Women in Jammu, and has a law degree from the University of Kashmir. Post 1989, she shifted to N. Delhi and joined the Bombay Mercantile Bank, after which she worked with East West Airlines, before moving back to J&amp;K. Her ex-husband is a political analyst, an animal-rights activist, and was briefly with National Conference party. She has two daughters, Iltija and Irtiqa.

==Political career==
When elections for the state assembly were held in 1996, Mehbooba became one of the most popular members elected from Bijbehara on an Indian National Congress ticket. Her father had returned to the Congress, which he had left in 1987, angry at the alliance that party had formed with its traditional rival in the state, the National Conference. She later served as the leader of the opposition in the assembly, taking on the government of chief minister Farooq Abdullah with asperity.

She resigned her assembly seat and went on to contest the parliamentary elections in 1999 from Srinagar, where she lost to incumbent member Omar Abdullah. She won the Pahalgam seat in the state assembly from South Kashmir, defeating Rafi Ahmed Mir, when assembly elections were held again in 2002. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Anantnag seat in 2004 and 2014. She defeated Mirza Mehboob Beg who was the incumbent MP in 2014 Lok Sabha Elections.

After her father&#x27;s death in January 2016, when he was heading the coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir, she took forward the same alliance with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the second time the BJP and the PDP formed a government in Jammu and Kashmir. On 4 April 2016, she took the oath and became the first woman Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.

On 25 June 2016, she won an Assembly seat in a by-election in Anantnag with the highest margin in any recent elections there and thereafter focussed on settling of Rohingyas.

On 19 June 2018, she resigned as chief minister of Kashmir. Her government had been an alliance between the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (PDP) and the BJP, but there was a rift in the alliance in February 2018, when two BJP ministers expressed public support for a man who was alleged to have raped and killed an eight-year-old girl in Kathua District. The BJP&#x27;s National General Secretary, Ram Madhav, announced the end of the alliance between the BJP and the PDP, and said that it was because of the deteriorating security situation. Mehbooba and the state government had tried suspending security operations for Ramadan, but the militants had not reciprocated, and 30 people were killed during the ceasefire. So the BJP withdrew from the alliance with the PDP so that the Indian government could get tough with the militants. When the alliance between the PDP and the BJP ended, Mehbooba resigned as chief minister. Mehbooba said &quot;the muscular policy will not work in Kashmir&quot;.

She contested 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Anantnag seat but lost it to Hasnain Masoodi of National Conference, and later also lost the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from Anantanag - Rajouri seat to Mian Altaf Ahmed Larvi of National Conference with 2.3 lakh votes.

== Detention ==
On 5 August 2019, she was detained by the Central government. Her daughter Iltija Mufti took over her mother&#x27;s Twitter account on the 46th day of detention. In November, Iltija Mufti wrote a letter to the Srinagar Deputy Commissioner to shift her mother to a place better equipped for the valley&#x27;s winter.

In February 2020 she was further detained under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act. She was released on 13 October 2020.

On 25 November 2020, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and People&#x27;s Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti was detained by Jammu and Kashmir Police and was not allowed to visit South Kashmir&#x27;s Pulwama to meet the family of senior PDP leader Waheed Para, who was arrested by the National Investigating Agency earlier that week.

Mufti said that her daughter Iltija Mufti has also been placed under house arrest.

<doc id="546954" wikidata="Q1330936" url="?curid=546954" title="Order of the Star of India">
<text>The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India is an order of chivalry founded by Queen Victoria in 1861. The Order includes members of three classes:

# Knight Grand Commander (GCSI)
# Knight Commander (KCSI)
# Companion (CSI)

No appointments have been made since the 1948 New Year Honours, shortly after the Partition of India in 1947. Following the death in 2009 of the last surviving knight, the Tej Singh Prabhakar, Maharaja of Alwar, the order became dormant.

The motto of the order was &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Light Our Guide&quot;. The Star of India emblem, the insignia of order and the informal emblem of British India, was also used as the basis of a series of flags to represent the Indian Empire.

The order was the fifth most senior British order of chivalry, following the Order of the Garter, Order of the Thistle, Order of St Patrick and Order of the Bath. It is the senior order of chivalry associated with the British Raj; junior to it is the Order of the Indian Empire, and there is also, for women only, the Imperial Order of the Crown of India.

==History==
Several years after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the consolidation of Great Britain&#x27;s power as the governing authority in India, it was decided by the British Crown to create a new order of knighthood to honour Indian Princes and Chiefs, as well as British officers and administrators who served in India. On 25 June 1861, the following proclamation was issued by Queen Victoria:

==Recipients==
===Knights Companion===
19 persons were appointed Knights Companion at the creation of the Order:

* Albert, Prince Consort
* Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
* Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning, GCB, Governor-General of India and Grand Master of the Order

* Sir George Russell Clerk, Governor of Bombay
* Sir John Laird Mair Lawrence, Bt, GCB, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab

* Yusef Ali Khan, Nawab of Rampur
* Nawab Sikander Begum, Nawab Begum of Bhopal

* Khanderao II Gaekwad, Maharaja of Baroda

12 additional Knights Companion were appointed over the next five years. 
* 19 August 1861

** Sir George Pollock, 1st Baronet GCB, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan

** Ayilyam Thirunal, Maharaja of Travancore
** General Sir William Mansfield, KCB, Commander-in-Chief, India
** Madan Pal, Maharaja of Karauli
** Sir Joginder Sen Bahadur KCSI, Maharaja of Mandi

On 24 May 1866, the Order was expanded to additional ranks. All surviving Knights Companion were elevated to Grand Commander.

===Later appointments===
Additional appointments were made to the Order in the ranks of Grand Commander, Knight Commander, and Companion. These include

* Shahu of Kolhapur, Maharaja of Kolhapur
* Maharaja Bir Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal
* Maharaja Bahadur Sir JAIMANGAL Singh of Gidhaur Estate KCSI 24.05.1866.
* Maharaja Bahadur Sir Ravaneshwar Singh of Gidhaur Estate KCIE 25.05.1895.
* Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur, Nawab of Dhaka
* Mir Osman Ali Khan Siddiqi Bayafandi - Asaf Jah VII - 7th Nizam of Hyderabad
* Maharaj Bhim Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana
* Sadeq Mohammad Khan IV, Nawab of Bahawalpur
* Khan Bahadur Sir Mohammad Usman of Madras KCIE was appointed KCSI on June 14, 1945.
The last appointments to the Order were made in the 1948 New Year Honours, some months after the Partition of India in August 1947.The Order of the Indian Empire, founded in 1877, was intended to be a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India; consequently, many more appointments were made to the latter than to the former.

As the last Grand Master of the Orders, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma was also the last known individual to wear publicly the stars of a Knight Grand Commander of both Orders, during the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II celebrations in 1977.

* There were only three female members of the Order: Nawab Sikander Begum of Bhopal; Nawab Sikander&#x27;s daughter, Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal; and Queen Mary, consort of George V.
* The last Grand Master of the Order, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten of Burma (1900–1979), was assassinated by the Provisional IRA on 27 August 1979.
* The last surviving Knight Grand Commander, Maharaja Sree Padmanabhadasa Sir Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma GCSI, GCIE, Maharajah of Travancore (1912–1991), died 19 July 1991 in Trivandrum.
* The last surviving Knight Commander, Maharaja Sir Tej Singh Prabhakar Bahadur KCSI (1911–2009), Maharaja of Alwar, died on 15 February 2009 in New Delhi.
* The last surviving Companion of the Order, Vice-Admiral Sir Ronald Brockman CSI (1909–1999), died on 3 September 1999 in London.

==Composition==

The British Sovereign was, and still is, Sovereign of the Order. The next most senior member was the Grand Master, a position held &quot;ex officio&quot; by the Viceroy of India. When the order was established in 1861, there was only one class of Knights Companion, who bore the postnominals KSI. In 1866, however, it was expanded to three classes. Members of the first class were known as &quot;Knights Grand Commander&quot; (rather than the usual &quot;Knights Grand Cross&quot;) so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order. All those surviving members who had already been made Knights Companion of the Order were retroactively known as Knights Grand Commander.

Former viceroys and other high officials, as well as those who served in the Department of the Secretary of State for India for at least thirty years were eligible for appointment. Rulers of Indian Princely States were also eligible for appointment. Some states were of such importance that their rulers were almost always appointed Knights Grand Commanders; such rulers included the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, the Maharaja of Baroda, the Maharajas of Gwalior, the Nawab of Bhopal, the Maharaja of Indore, the Maharajas of Singrauli, the Maharana of Udaipur, the Maharaja of Travancore, the Maharaja of Jodhpur and the Maharao of Cutch.

Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh of Benares and Sir Azizul Haque were appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1892 and 1941 respectively, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) in 1898, and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) for his services in the First World War in the 1921 New Year Honours.

Rulers of other nations in Asia and the Middle East, including the Emir of Kuwait, the Maharajas of the Rana dynasty, the Khedive of Egypt, the King of Bhutan and the rulers of Zanzibar, Bahrain and Oman were also appointed to the Order. Like some rulers of princely states, some rulers of particular prestige, for example the Maharajas of the Rana dynasty or the Sultans of Oman, were usually appointed Knights Grand Commanders.

Women, save the princely rulers, were ineligible for appointment to the order. They were, unlike the habit of many other orders, admitted as &quot;Knights&quot;, rather than as &quot;Dames&quot; or &quot;Ladies&quot;. The first woman to be admitted to the order was Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal; she was created a Knight Companion at the Order&#x27;s foundation in 1861. The order&#x27;s statutes were specially amended to permit the admission of Queen Mary as a Knight Grand Commander in 1911.

==Vestments and accoutrements==

Members of the Order wore elaborate costumes on important ceremonial occasions:
* The &quot;&quot;, worn only by Knights Grand Commander, was made of light blue satin lined with white silk. On the left side was a representation of the star (see below).
* The &quot;collar&quot;, also worn only by Knights Grand Commander, was made of gold. It was composed of alternating figures of lotuses, red and white roses and palm branches, with an imperial crown in the centre.

On certain &quot;collar days&quot; designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events wore the order&#x27;s collar over their military uniform, formal day dress, or evening wear. When collars were worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge was suspended from the collar.
At less important occasions, simpler insignia were used:
* The &quot;star&quot;, worn only by Knights Grand Commanders and Knights Commanders, included a sunburst, with twenty-six large rays alternating with twenty-six small rays; it was in gold and circular for Knights Grand Commanders, and in silver and eight-pointed for Knights Commanders. In the centre of the sunburst was a light blue ring bearing the motto of the Order. Within the ribbon was a five-pointed star, decorated with diamonds for Knights Grand Commanders.
* The &quot;badge&quot; was worn by Knights Grand Commanders on a white-edged light blue riband, or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip, and by Knights Commanders and Companions from a white-edged light blue ribbon around the neck. It included an oval, containing the effigy of the Sovereign, surrounded by a light blue ring bearing the motto of the Order; the oval was suspended from a five-pointed star, which may be decorated with diamonds depending on class.

Unlike the insignia of most other British chivalric orders, the insignia of the Order of the Star of India did not incorporate crosses, as they were deemed unacceptable to the Indian princes appointed to the Order.

==Precedence and privileges==
Members of all classes of the Order were assigned positions in the order of precedence. Wives of members of all classes also featured on the order of precedence, as did sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Commanders and Knights Commanders. (See order of precedence in England and Wales for the exact positions.)
Knights Grand Commanders used the post-nominal initials &quot;GCSI&quot;, Knights Commanders &quot;KCSI&quot; and Companions &quot;CSI&quot;. Knights Grand Commanders and Knights Commanders prefixed &quot;Sir&quot; to their forenames. Wives of Knights Grand Commanders and Knights Commanders could prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames. Such forms were not used by peers and Indian princes, except when the names of the former were written out in their fullest forms.

Knights Grand Commanders were also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. They could, furthermore, encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Knights Commanders and Companions were permitted to display the circlet, but not the collar, surrounding their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet.

<doc id="546969" wikidata="Q1993508" url="?curid=546969" title="Magic constant">
<text>The magic constant or magic sum of a magic square is the sum of numbers in any row, column, or diagonal of the magic square. For example, the magic square shown below has a magic constant of 15. For a normal magic square of order &quot;n&quot; – that is, a magic square which contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;2 – the magic constant is formula_1.
For normal magic squares of orders &quot;n&quot; = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the magic constants are, respectively: 15, 34, 65, 111, 175, and 260 (sequence in the OEIS).
For example, a normal 8 × 8 square will always equate to 260 for each row, column, or diagonal.
The normal magic constant of order &quot;n&quot; is .
The largest magic constant of normal magic square which is also a:
*triangular number is 15 (solve the Diophantine equation where &quot;y&quot; is divisible by 4);
*square number is 1 (solve the Diophantine equation where &quot;y&quot; is even);
*generalized pentagonal number is 171535 (solve the Diophantine equation where &quot;y&quot; is divisible by 12);
*tetrahedral number is 2925.

Note that 0 and 1 are the only normal magic constants of rational order which are also rational squares.

However, there are infinitely many rational triangular numbers, rational generalized pentagonal numbers and rational tetrahedral numbers which are also magic constants of rational order.

The term magic constant or magic sum is similarly applied to other &quot;magic&quot; figures such as magic stars and magic cubes. Number shapes on a triangular grid divided into equal polyiamond areas containing equal sums give polyiamond magic constant.

==Magic stars==
The magic constant of an &quot;n&quot;-pointed normal magic star is formula_2.

==Magic series==
In 2013 Dirk Kinnaes found the magic series polytope. The number of unique sequences that form the magic constant is now known up to formula_3.

==Moment of inertia==
In the mass model, the value in each cell specifies the mass for that cell. This model has two notable properties. First it demonstrates the balanced nature of all magic squares. If such a model is suspended from the central cell the structure balances. (consider the magic sums of the rows/columns .. equal mass at an equal distance balance). The second property that can be calculated is the moment of inertia. Summing the individual moments of inertia (distance squared from the center × the cell value) gives the moment of inertia for the magic square, which depends solely on the order of the square.

<text>Mingulay () is the second largest of the Bishop&#x27;s Isles in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Located south of Barra, it is known for an extensive Gaelic oral tradition incorporating folklore, song and stories and its important seabird populations, including puffins, black-legged kittiwakes, and razorbills, which nest in the sea-cliffs, amongst the highest in the British Isles.

There are Iron Age remains, and the culture of the island was influenced by early Christianity and the Vikings. Between the 15th and 19th centuries Mingulay was part of the lands of Clan MacNeil of Barra, but subsequently suffered at the hands of absentee landlords.

After two thousand years or more of continuous habitation, the island was abandoned by its Gaelic-speaking residents in 1912 and has remained uninhabited since. It is no longer used for grazing sheep. The island is also associated with the &quot;Mingulay Boat Song&quot;, although that was composed in 1938. The National Trust for Scotland has owned Mingulay since 2000.

==Geology and soils==
In the Pleistocene era Mingulay was covered by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were lower than at present and circa 14,000 BP it was joined to a single large island comprising most of what is now the Outer Hebrides. Steadily rising sea levels since that time then isolated the island, which is made up of Hebridean gneiss interspersed with some granite. The ice deposited both erratic blocks of rock and boulder clay on the eastern side of the island around Mingulay Bay. The rest of the island is covered in peat, thin acidic soils, or bare rock.

==Geography and pre-history==
Mingulay is part of the small archipelago known as the Bishop or Barra Isles which are &quot;composed of a cluster of islands surrounded by a boisterous sea, making the passage of one island to another a matter of very considerable hazard&quot; and which form the southern end of the larger Outer Hebrides group.

There is one large beach on the eastern side of the isle, where the only settlement of note (&#x27;The Village&#x27;) was located, and a tiny cove at Skipsdale (Old Norse: &quot;ship valley&quot;). Bagh na h-Aoineig (Scots Gaelic: &quot;bay of the steep promontory&quot;) on the western side is a deep cleft in the sea-cliffs once thought to be the highest in the UK which rise to 213 m (699 ft) above sea level at Builacraig.

Mingulay has three large sea stacks: Arnamul (Old Norse: &quot;Erne mound&quot;), Lianamul (Old Norse: &quot;Flax mound&quot;) and Gunamul, which has a natural arch in 150 m (490 ft) cliffs through which boats can sail on rare days when the sea is calm. There are several outlying islets including the twin rocks of Sròn a Dùin to the south-west, Geirum Mòr and Geirum Beag to the south between Mingulay and the nearby island of Berneray, and Solon Mòr (&#x27;Big Gannet&#x27;), Solon Beag (&#x27;Little Gannet&#x27;), Sgeirean nan Uibhein, Barnacle Rock and a smaller stack called The Red Boy, all to the north between Mingulay and Pabbay.

The highest hills are Càrnan (273 m or 896 ft), Hecla (Old Norse: &quot;Hooded shroud&quot;) (219 m or 719 ft) and Macphee&#x27;s Hill (224 m or 735 ft). The last was named when a relief ship was sent by MacNeil of Barra to discover why communications from the island had ceased. A crewman called Macphee was sent ashore and returned to report that the residents had all died of disease. Fearing the plague, his shipmates refused to allow him back on board. He survived for a year, and climbed the hill every day to look out for a rescue. When the island was re-settled the chief of the Clan MacNeil of Barra granted him land there.

The south-western promontory of Dun Mingulay has the remains of an Iron Age fort and there is a pre-historic site at Crois an t-Suidheachain near the western landing place at Aneir at the southern end of Mingulay Bay, which may have been a stone circle. In 1971 a 2,000-year-old Iron Age midden was found resting on sand near the &#x27;Village&#x27; overlooking the Bay. A stone &#x27;pebble hammer&#x27; was discovered nearby in 1975, but it has not been possible to date the find. Skipisdale may also contain Iron Age remains.

==Name==
In historic times the Hebrides have been heavily influenced by Celtic, Norse and Scots culture and this is evident in the variety of names the isle possesses. &quot;Mingulay&quot; is derived from &quot;Mikil-ay&quot;, the Old Norse for &quot;Big Island&quot; although this is misleading as it is only the second largest of the Barra Isles behind Vatersay, which is lower lying and appears smaller from the sea. &quot;Miughalaigh&quot; and &quot;Miùghlaigh&quot; are two variants of the Gaelic name. Lowland Scots speakers in their turn have variously described the island as &quot;Mewla&quot; or &quot;Miuley&quot; (which are both approximations of the Gaelic pronunciation), &quot;Megaly&quot; and &quot;Micklay&quot; before finally settling on the current variant.

Murray (1973) states that the name &quot;appropriately means Bird Island&quot;.

==History and culture==

===Christianity, Norsemen and Clan MacNeil===
Early Christianity influenced Mingulay (for example the nearby islands of Pabbay and Berneray both have cross-inscribed slabs) but no direct evidence has yet been found. From circa 871 onwards Viking raids on the Outer Hebrides gathered pace but similarly the Viking graves found on Berneray and Vatersay are not replicated on Mingulay and whilst there are no definite indications of Norse settlement, their presence on the island is confirmed by the many features they named.

Acknowledged by Malcolm III as part of the Kingdom of the Isles, a Norwegian crown dependency, from the 12th century onwards Norwegian power in the Western Isles weakened. By the 1266 Treaty of Perth they reverted to the Scottish crown control under the tutelage of the quasi-autonomous &quot;Lordship of Garmoran&quot; (ruled by the MacRory, a faction among the rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles). In 1427, following violence between the MacRory heirs to Garmoran (Clan Ranald, the Siol Gorrie, and Siol Murdoch), Garmoran was declared forfeit.

That same year – 1427 – following the forfeiture, the Lords of the Isles (the remaining MacRory heirs) awarded Lairdship of Barra (and its associated islands) and half of South Uist to Clan MacNeil of Barra. They adopted the cliffs of Builacraig as part of their traditional crest and used the name as a war-cry. However, following acts of piracy by the MacNeils, king James VI transferred ownership of some of the southern archipelago (including Mingulay) to the Bishop of the Isles, hence those islands became known as the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Isles&quot; .

The islanders&#x27; livelihood was based on fishing (for white fish, herring and lobster), crofting (with up to 55 ha (0.21 sq mi) of arable and pasture land fertilised by wrack on which sheep, cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry were kept) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds. For example, rent was payable to The MacNeil in or &#x27;fatlings&#x27; – shearwater chicks.

The Reformation never reached the south of the Outer Hebrides and Roman Catholicism held sway from the 12th century to the early 20th. The lack of a resident priest meant that services were often organised by the lay community, but the local culture and traditions of songs and story-telling were rich and varied. As Samuel Johnson observed when lamenting his failure to reach thus far on his 18th-century Hebridean journey:
Popery is favourable to ceremony; and among the ignorant nations ceremony is the only preservative of tradition. Since Protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland, it has perhaps been one of the chief labours of the Ministers to abolish stated observances, because they continued the remembrance of the former religion.
Some of the local beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the practitioners of organised religion. An each-uisge was thought to live in a bottomless well near the summit of Macphee&#x27;s Hill, and faery and their associated music were taken for granted, if generally avoided. The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis. Yet the old ways themselves were dying.

===Absentee landlords===
The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) were sold to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of consideration for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances seemed to have the effect of increasing Mingulay&#x27;s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay&#x27;s remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were reduced from 1840 to 1845. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.

In 1764 the population of the island was 52. Later census records show that there were 113 residents in 1841, 150 in 1881, 142 in 1891 (occupying 28 houses, compared to the 1841 total of 19), and 135 in 1901. Families were often large, and ten or more children was not uncommon, with three generations sometimes sharing a single small house. Life was co-operative with fishing, waulking, peat cutting and landing the boats all being communal activities. The island is remote but was by no means cut off. In the 19th century fishermen sold fish in Glasgow and Ireland, both men and women worked on the east coast herring fishing industry, and food was brought in from mainland Scotland on a regular basis.

At the height of village life there was a mill, a chapel house consisting of a church and a priest&#x27;s residence, and a school. However, despite there being a continuous population on Mingulay for at least two thousand years, evacuations began in 1907 and the island was completely abandoned by its residents in 1912.

===Evacuation===
There were numerous reasons for the evacuation. In 1897 a boat from the neighbouring island of Pabbay was lost off Barra Head with its crew of five: more than half of Pabbay&#x27;s male population, and this did not encourage confidence amongst the fishermen of Mingulay. The lack of a sheltered landing meant that the island could be unreachable for weeks at a time, and loading and unloading goods was at best strenuous and at worst hazardous. This may have meant less at a time when possessions were fewer, but no doubt the population was also increasingly aware of their relative isolation. Writing about the collapse of similar populations in the Hebrides, Neat (2000) suggests:

one common thread would appear to be the unwillingness of even the most stoical and historically-aware communities to continue an existence based upon endless physical hardship when the opportunity of an easier livelihood elsewhere is there to be taken.
Buxton (1995) tells the story of two men who left Mingulay together. One was visiting Barra, and the other intended to emigrate to New York. They said their farewells in Castlebay but it did not work out for the latter and he returned from the United States three months later. To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.

The ferocity of the weather also created constant hardship. In 1868 a wave washed over the top of Geirum Mor, taking the sheep with it. The summit of the islet is 51 metres (170 ft) above sea level. Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) also speculate about the &quot;quiet failure&quot; of the populations of small islands like Mingulay to husband their available natural resources. Certainly the population began to exceed the carrying capacity of the land. The Congested Districts Board installed a derrick to assist with the landings at Aneir at the south end of the Bay in 1901, but the design was flawed and its failure was a further disappointment.

In July 1906 grazing land on Vatersay was raided by landless cottars from Barra and its isles, including three families from Mingulay. They were followed in 1907 by eight more raiders from Mingulay led by Micheal Neill Eachainn. Lady Gordon Cathcart took legal action but the visiting judge took the view that she had neglected her duties as a landowner and that &quot;long indifference to the necessities of the cottars had gone far to drive them to exasperation&quot;. Vatersay has sheltered anchorages and was only 300 metres (330 yd) from Barra (until the construction of a causeway in 1990) and Neil MacPhee wrote &quot;it is better a thousand times to die here than to go through the same hardships which were our lot&quot; on Mingulay.

In November 1907 six more families consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, which has a sheltered beach. Meanwhile, the plight of the Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.
By 1910 there were only a dozen fishermen in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.

Mingulay bears physical similarities to the island of Hirta, which was evacuated in 1930, although Storey (2008) confirms that the abandonment of Mingulay was unlike that of St Kilda: the Mingulay islanders left of their own accord, and did not have the benefit of Government support as in the St Kilda situation. Mingulay is sometimes referred to as the &quot;near St Kilda&quot;. Mingulay is less than a third of the distance from &quot;The Long Island&quot; that Hirta is, yet a 19th-century visitor commented that the former was &quot;much more primitive than St Kilda, especially as regards the cottars&#x27; and crofters&#x27; houses&quot;, suggesting that the lack of a permanent landing was of greater import than sheer distance.

===1912 to the present day===
After the island was evacuated it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from Barra. In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a sheep farmer in both Australia and Montana. Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company, choosing to live on the island alone all autumn and winter with his pet ferrets and cats, and joined by two shepherds for the spring and summer only. After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters&#x27; syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company&#x27;s ownership continued for the next forty years.

In 2000 Mingulay was acquired by the National Trust for Scotland through a bequest by J. M. Fawcitt &quot;to provide an area of natural beauty in memory of her parents and the courage of her late brother, Bernard.&quot;

Only two buildings survive on the island: the schoolhouse and the chapel house, although the latter has recently lost its roof and front wall.

==Flora and fauna==
Mingulay has a large seabird population, and is an important breeding ground for razorbills (9,514 pairs, 6.3% of the European population), guillemots (11,063 pairs) and black-legged kittiwakes (2,939 pairs). shags (694 individuals), fulmar (11,626 pairs), puffins (2,072 pairs), storm petrel, common terns, Arctic terns, bonxies and various species of gull also nest in the sea-cliffs. Manx shearwaters nested on Lianamul stack until the late 18th century, when they were driven away by puffins, and tysties have also been recorded there.

In recent years, to help limit the spread of bird flu, access to the puffin colonies has been restricted through the use of sections of metal fences but it is still possible to get quite close to the burrows. 

Sheep graze the island&#x27;s rough pastures and there is a population of rabbits, introduced by shepherds after the 1912 evacuation. Grey seals are abundant, numbers having grown substantially since the departure of human residents. Although they do not breed, up to 1,000 make use of the beach in winter.

The flora of the island is typical of the Outer Hebrides with heather, sphagnum moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree – a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.

Mingulay and nearby Berneray became a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1983.

===Important Bird Area===
The island (along with neighbouring Berneray) has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding populations of several species of seabirds.

==Visiting Mingulay==
The island attracts regular visits from naturalists and in recent years has also become popular with rock climbers. The National Trust for Scotland operates two licensed boatmen from Barra and further information may be available at the tourist office in Castlebay.

There is an &quot;occasional&quot; anchorage in Mingulay Bay sheltered from westerly winds. Landing on the beach may be difficult as there is a regular heavy swell and approaching the old landing place at Aneir may be easier. There is also a landing place at Skipisdale.

==Mingulay Boat Song==
The &quot;Mingulay Boat Song&quot; was composed by Hugh S. Roberton, the founder of the Glasgow Orpheus Choir, in 1938, and first recorded by the Francis McPeake family of Ulster. Written in the style of Hebridean work songs to the tune &quot;Creag Guanach&quot; from Lochaber, it invites the listener to imagine the boatsmen of the island singing in time to the pulling of their oars.

It has been recorded by numerous artists including Robin Hall and Jimmy MacGregor in 1971, The Idlers and Richard Thompson in 2006, and by Kris Delmhorst on her 2003 &quot;Songs for a Hurricane&quot; album. 

The lyrics have also been variously interpreted. For example, Hall and MacGregor&#x27;s 1961 version has a female vocalist (Shirley Bland) rendering the third stanza as:

Although the fame of the song means that it is one of the few things popularly associated with the island and it is evocative of island life, it was never sung by its residents, having been composed long after the evacuation.

Other songs composed by or about residents of the island survive. These include &quot;Oran do dh&#x27;Eilean Mhiulaidh&quot; (Song to the Isle of Mingulay) written by Neil MacPhee the Vatersay raider (see above), after the abandonment of the island, and &quot;Turas Neill a Mhiughlaigh&quot; (Neil&#x27;s Trip to Mingulay) written by Father Allan MacLean (known locally as the &quot;Curate of Spain&quot; having attended the Scots College in Valladolid), possibly during the period 1837–40 when he lived on Barra. Songs and oral tradition relating to Mingulay are discussed in Liza Storey&#x27;s &quot;Muinntir Mhiughalaigh&quot; (2008).

==In literature==
* There is a local tradition that French gold intended to support the 1745 Jacobite rebellion was hidden in a sea cave on the west coast. This story forms the basis of the novel &quot;Children of Tempest&quot; by Neil Munro.
* Mingulay is the name of an isolated human colony in Ken MacLeod&#x27;s &quot;Cosmonaut Keep&quot;, book one in the &quot;Engines Of Light&quot; series of science-fiction novels.
* In the science-fiction novel &quot;A Boy and his Dog at the End of the World&quot; by C. A. Fletcher, Mingulay is the home of a family a few generations removed from the ending of human civilisation, and the first location setting of the story.

<text>James Jacob Ritty (29 October 1836 – 29 March 1918), saloonkeeper and inventor, opened his first saloon in Dayton, Ohio in 1871, billing himself as a &quot;Dealer in Pure Whiskies, Fine Wines, and Cigars.&quot; Some of Ritty&#x27;s employees would take the customers&#x27; money that was meant to pay for the food, drink, and other wares. In 1878 while on a steamboat trip to Europe, Ritty became intrigued by a mechanism that counted how many times the ship&#x27;s propeller went around. He wondered whether something such as this could be made to record the cash transactions made at his saloon.

As soon as he got home to Dayton, Ritty and his brother John, a skilled mechanic, began working on a design for such a device. After several failed prototypes, they created their third design, operated by pressing a key that represented a specific amount of money. There was no cash drawer. James and John Ritty patented the design on November 4, 1879, as &quot;Ritty&#x27;s Incorruptible Cashier&quot;.

The Rittys opened a small factory in Dayton to manufacture cash registers while still operating the saloon. The company did not prosper and in 1881, James Ritty became overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running two businesses, and sold all his interests in the cash register business. The buyers were a group of investors including Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman who formed the National Manufacturing Company, and John and Frank Patterson, who were then in the coal and railroad business. John H. Patterson became majority owner in 1884, when the company was renamed The National Cash Register Company.

Ritty was not resentful that he did not benefit much from his invention and maintained friendly relations with John H. Patterson and many times was invited to attend various NCR meetings and conferences.

James Ritty opened another saloon, the Pony House, in 1882 in a building on South Jefferson Street that was previously a school of French and English for young ladies. For the Pony House, Ritty commissioned woodcarvers from Barney and Smith Car Company to turn 5,400 pounds of Honduras mahogany into a bar. The fruit of their labors was a bar tall and wide. The initials JR adorn the center peak and the left and right sections are similar to the interior of a passenger railcar, with the giant mirrors set back about a foot with curved, hand-tooled leather-covered elements at the top and curved bezel mirror-encrusted sections on each side. When the Pony House building was torn down in 1967, the bar was saved and today is the bar at Jay&#x27;s Seafood in Dayton.
James Ritty retired from the bar business in 1895. He died of heart trouble in his downtown Dayton Arcade residence. He is entombed with his wife Susan and his brother John (ca 1834–28 December 1913) at Dayton&#x27;s Woodland Cemetery.

<text>The NCAA men&#x27;s water polo championship is an annual tournament organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the national champion of men&#x27;s collegiate water polo among its member programs in the United States. It has been held every year since 1969, except 2020 when it was postponed to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

With a limited number of NCAA water polo programs at the national level, all men&#x27;s teams, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, are eligible to compete each year; currently, there are only 43 men&#x27;s water polo teams between all three NCAA divisions.

The tournament was expanded from a four-team bracket in 2013 by adding two play-in games that are contested by the bottom four seeds, effectively creating a six-team bracket with a first-round bye for the top two teams. Starting with the 2023 tournament, the number of teams was increased to eight teams. Even with this expansion, the men&#x27;s water polo tournament remains the smallest across all NCAA sports.

While the championship often includes teams from around the country, most programs are located within the state of California, and no school from outside California has ever surpassed third place or participated in the NCAA Men&#x27;s Water Polo Championship game.

The four California based Pac-12 schools have been the most successful. The University of California, Berkeley is the most successful program with 17 titles, followed by UCLA with 13 titles, Stanford (11 titles), and USC (10 titles). One of these four schools has won the championship every year since 1998.

<doc id="547001" wikidata="Q299291" url="?curid=547001" title="Avidius Cassius">
<text>Gaius Avidius Cassius ( 130 – July 175 AD) was a Syrian Roman general and usurper. He was born in Cyrrhus, and was the son of Gaius Avidius Heliodorus, who served as &quot;praefectus&quot; or governor of Roman Egypt, and Julia Cassia Alexandra, who was related to a number of royal figures, including her descent from both Augustus and Herod the Great. He began his military career under Antoninus Pius, rising to the status of &quot;legatus legionis&quot;. He served during the Parthian war of Lucius Verus, in which he distinguished himself, for which he was elevated to the Senate, and later made Imperial legate. During the Bucolic War, he was given the extraordinary title of &quot;Rector Orientis&quot;, giving him &quot;Imperium&quot; over all of the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. 

In 175, Cassius declared himself emperor, because he had received news, from Marcus Aurelius&#x27; wife Faustina the Younger, that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was about to die. He received broad support in the eastern provinces of Egypt, Syria, Syria Palaestina and Arabia Petraea, especially Syria, which was his homeland. Despite his control of the vital grain production of Egypt, and his command of seven legions, he was heavily outmatched by Aurelius. While Aurelius was amassing a force to defeat Cassius, a centurion of one of Cassius&#x27; legions murdered Cassius, sending his head to Aurelius as proof.

==Early life==
Avidius Cassius was born around 130, in the town of Cyrrhus, Syria. He was born to Gaius Avidius Heliodorus and Julia Cassia Alexandra. His father, Heliodorus, was of equestrian status, and served as &quot;Ab epistulis&quot; for Hadrian. Heliodorus later served as &quot;Praefectus augustalis&quot;, the prefect of Roman Egypt, from 137 to 142AD. According to Cassius Dio, he received this post, which was one of the highest posts that an equestrian could hold, due to his oratory skills alone. His mother, Julia Cassia, was the great-granddaughter of Junia Lepida, who was herself a great-great-granddaughter of the first Roman emperor, Augustus. She was also a descendant of Herod the Great through her father, Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus. Cassius was also a distant descendant of the Roman client-king Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Commagene, who had been dethroned half a century before.

==Early career==
It is thought that Cassius began his career during the reign of Antoninus Pius. He may have been as a quaestor in 154. It is thought that he became a &quot;legatus legionis&quot; of one of the legions stationed in Moesia Inferior, which guarded against the Sarmatians, during the late years of Pius&#x27; rule (138–161), and it is certain that he was a &quot;legatus&quot; by at least 161AD, the last year of Pius&#x27; reign.

Cassius rose to prominence rapidly 164, under the co-emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius, during the Parthian war of Lucius Verus, serving as &quot;legatus legionis&quot; or commander of &quot;Legio III Gallica&quot;. In 165, he led &quot;Legio III Gallica&quot; down the Euphrates, and defeated the Parthians at Dura-Europos. Before the end of the year, Cassius and his legion marched to the south, crossed Mesopotamia at its narrowest point, and attacked and sacked the twin Parthian cities of the Tigris river: Seleucia, which was on the right bank; and Ctesiphon, which was on the left bank and was the Parthian capital. After capturing Ctesiphon, he burnt the palace of Vologases IV. Despite the fact that Seleucia had surrendered to the Romans, he destroyed it as well, justifying it by claiming that the local population had broken their agreement. 

Cassius&#x27; legion was by this time in dire need of supplies. The first signs of what became known as the Antonine Plague showed up in his army in 165. Cassius marched back to Syria, carrying with him the spoils taken from his campaign. He sent details of his campaign to Rome, for which he was rewarded with elevation to the Senate. Much of his success was credited to Emperor Lucius Verus, who, although himself an excellent commander, was notedly unafraid of delegating military tasks to more competent generals.

In May of 166, Cassius was made suffect consul, a position he held while still stationed outside of Rome. During that year, Lucius Verus and Cassius launched a new campaign against the Parthians, invading across the northern stretch of the Tigris river, into Media. During this time, a false rumor reached Rome that Cassius had led Legio III Gallica across the Indus River. In late 166AD, Cassius was appointed imperial legate of Syria.

In 170, Cassius was given the extraordinary title of &quot;Rector Orientis&quot; (literally &quot;Supreme Commander of the Orient&quot;), giving him &quot;imperium&quot; over the entirety of the eastern section of the empire, in order to combat a large rebellion in Egypt, commonly called the Bucolic War. This rebellion was centered in the area of the Pentapolis of Middle Egypt, and was motivated by a rapid rise of grain prices in the area. The Bucoli came close to capturing Alexandria, but were halted by Cassius&#x27; troops. Cassius succeeded in putting down this revolt in 175, after using a strategy of dividing the various revolting tribespeople, and then conquering them.

==Usurpation==
In 175, after hearing false reports that Marcus Aurelius had succumbed to his severe illness, Cassius declared himself emperor, claiming that Aurelius&#x27; troops in Pannonia, where he had been leading troops as a part of the Marcomannic War, had elected him emperor. Some versions say that Cassius was tricked, or persuaded, by Faustina the Younger, who was the wife of Aurelius, because she feared that Aurelius would die while Commodus, their son, was still young, a situation which would likely have led to a usurper seizing the throne for himself. According to these accounts, Faustina thus tricked, or persuaded, Cassius into rebelling, to ensure the next emperor was someone of her choosing. The exact date of his revolt is unknown, although it is known that he revolted by at least 3 May, due to a document about his emperorship from that date. A papyrus from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri has shown that Cassius was confident of Egyptian support as early as April or even March.

Aurelius attempted to suppress news of the revolt, but, when it became widespread throughout his camp, chose to address it in a speech. The exact wording of his speech is unknown, as the record given by Cassius Dio is believed to be a free composition, which followed only the outline of Aurelius&#x27; actual speech. In the record, Aurelius laments the betrayal of a dear friend, and says that if the danger had been to him alone, he would be willing to &quot;set the issue&quot; between himself and Cassius, before the Senate and the Army, and would have yielded the empire to Cassius, if the senate and army considered him the better leader. He was also recorded as saying that he hoped that Cassius would not be killed or commit suicide, so that he could show mercy. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a work both treasured by historians and notorious for its falsehoods, records that Aurelius formed a peace commission among his advisors.

Cassius started the rebellion in a good position. He received large support from the Eastern provinces, especially his homeland of Syria, due to a combination of his distant royal descent, his victories in the Parthian War and the Bucolic War. He received support from the provinces of Egypt, Syria, Syria Palaestina and Arabia Petraea, giving him a potential strength of seven legions: three from Syria, two from Syria Palaestina, one from Roman Arabia, and one from Egypt. Cassius set his base of operations in Egypt, with two important bases outside of Egypt being Antioch and Cyrrhus, both important military centres. Gaius Calvisius Statianus, the contemporary prefect of Egypt, issued an edict, which has survived in a fragmentary state, ordering the populace of Egypt to rejoice at the accession of Cassius. 

Despite controlling some of the most important parts of the Roman East, especially Egypt which was a critical supplier of grain for the city of Rome, Cassius failed to win widespread support for his rebellion. The Roman Senate swiftly declared Cassius a public enemy, and Publius Martius Verus, the governor of Cappadocia, who staunchly opposed the rebellion, rallied public support for Aurelius. Cassius, through the marriage of his daughter, Avidia Alexandra, to Titius Claudius Dryantianus Antonius, had connection to the Licinnii of Lycia, including Claudius Dryantianus&#x27;s father Tiberius Claudius Agrippinus, who was a consul. The aristocratic Licinnii are one of the most well known Lycian families. It is unknown how much of a role Claudius Dryantianus played, although it is known that some considered him to be Cassius&#x27; partner in crime. Claudius Dryantianus and Avidia Alexandra were pardoned by Marcus Aurelius, although Claudius Dryantianus&#x27; estate was confiscated after his death.

Many nobles throughout the empire opposed the rebellion, one example being Herodes Atticus, who is recorded as having sent Cassius a letter containing only the word &quot;emanes&quot;, literally &quot;you are mad&quot;. Despite this widespread opposition, the capital of Rome was thrown into a panic, which forced Aurelius to send Gaius Vettius Sabinianus Julius Hospes, the governor of Pannonia Inferior, with troops to secure the city. Aurelius was forced to withdraw from his campaign against the Iazyges, and end the Marcomannic War. Several barbarian tribes sent offers of their assistance to Aurelius, all of which were refused. Aurelius amassed troops and prepared to depart for the East, to depose Cassius. It was soon clear that Aurelius was in a stronger position, with far more legions available to him than to Cassius. When news of Aurelius&#x27; plans to invade reached Egypt, a centurion killed Cassius, and sent his head to Aurelius, who refused to see it, and ordered it buried. He was likely killed by at least the end of July 175, as Egypt chose to recognize Aurelius again on 28 July 175. Cassius had rebelled for three months and six days before being killed, during which time no coins were struck bearing his image.

===Aftermath===
After the death of Cassius, Publius Martius Verus swiftly took control of Syria, and burned all of Cassius&#x27; correspondences. Even after the news of Cassius&#x27; death had reached Marcus Aurelius, Aurelius was still determined to visit the east. He set off with a body of advisors, along with his wife, Faustina, who died along the way, in a village in south Cappadocia, about south of Tyana, called Halala. The town was renamed in her honor, and his son, Commodus. After the death of Faustina, Aurelius wrote to the Senate, asking them for a report on Cassius&#x27; supporters, but specifically saying he desired no bloodshed to punish them, as several retributions had already been carried out in the name of Aurelius. Among these were the killing of Avidius Maecianus, a son of Cassius. Aurelius ordered the banishment of Avidius Heliodorus, another son of Cassius. Avidia Alexandra, the daughter of Cassius, and her husband, were placed under the protection of &quot;an uncle by marriage&quot;, believed to be Claudius Titianus, a Lycian senator.

==Personal life==
Dio spoke highly of Cassius, saying that he was a &quot;good man&quot; whose only fault was that his father, Heliodorus, was given his post of &quot;Praefectus augustalis&quot; only because of his speaking abilities. He was labelled as being a strict during his time as commander of Legio III Gallica.

Cassius was married to Volusia Vettia Maeciana, daughter of Lucius Volusius Maecianus, and had at least three children (the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; implies he may have had more):
* Avidius Heliodorus – first son of Cassius, who was banished by order of the emperor.
* Avidius Maecianus – second son of Cassius, who was killed after the revolt had been put down.
* Avidia Alexandra – daughter of Cassius, who was forced to live under the protection of an uncle, alongside her husband, Titius Claudius Dryantianus Antonius. Avidia and Claudius had four children: 
** Claudius Cassius Agrippinus – he became a senator and was &quot;&quot;ad honores admissus&quot;.&quot;
** Claudia Maeciana Alexandra.
** Claudia Vettia Agrippina.
** Claudia Dryantilla Platonis – one of the women who took part in the &quot;ludi saeculares&quot; of the year 204 AD. She married Cornelius Optatus (or Optatianus), who was either a consul or &quot;&quot;adlectus inter consulares&quot;.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Roman Empire: Reign of Blood&quot;
*&quot;Gladiator Begins&quot;
*&quot;20s A Difficult Age&quot;, one of the series&#x27; antagonist is based on and named after Cassius.

<text>&quot;Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?&quot; (), often referred to simply as &quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot;, is a 1784 essay by the philosopher Immanuel Kant. In the December 1784 publication of the &quot;Berlinische Monatsschrift&quot; (&quot;Berlin Monthly&quot;), edited by Friedrich Gedike and Johann Erich Biester, Kant replied to the question posed a year earlier by the Reverend , who was also an official in the Prussian government. Zöllner&#x27;s question was addressed to a broad intellectual public community, in reply to Biester&#x27;s essay titled &quot;Proposal, not to engage the clergy any longer when marriages are conducted&quot; (April 1783). A number of leading intellectuals replied with essays, of which Kant&#x27;s is the most famous and has had the most impact. Kant&#x27;s opening paragraph of the essay is a much-cited definition of a lack of enlightenment as people&#x27;s inability to think for themselves due not to their lack of intellect, but lack of courage.

<text>Charles Forrest &quot;Spike&quot; Spencer (born December 21, 1968) is an American voice actor and columnist best known for dubbing Japanese anime films. He is known for his roles in ADV Films dubs of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; as Shinji Ikari, &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; as Akito Tenkawa, and &quot;Excel Saga&quot; as Gojo Shioji. He has also performed voice acting for radio, especially commercials. His anime character voices tend to be either for timid, shy, or weak characters, or for eccentric and comical ones.

==Career==
Spencer attended the University of Houston for four years. After doing a number of independent films, he met Amanda Winn-Lee, who suggested he audition for anime English dubbing at ADV Films. Spencer first landed a supporting role of Prime Minister Mikoshiba in &quot;Super Atragon&quot;, then a leading role of Takateru in &quot;Suikoden Demon Century.&quot; In August 1996, Spencer was cast as the lead role of Shinji Ikari in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. After ADV Films&#x27; collapse, Funimation acquired the rights to the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; movies. As part of Funimation&#x27;s goal to get the service of the original voice actors from shows and movies they acquired distributing rights for, Spencer reprised Shinji in the movies.

Spencer has done commercials for Houston Cellular, Applebee&#x27;s, Kroger, Chevrolet, and Subway. Spencer has done additional acting in live-action films and in TV series such as &quot;The Big Easy&quot;.

Spencer also travels the world with his panel, Don&#x27;t Kill Your Date (and Other Cooking Tips), which teaches Spencer&#x27;s trademark &quot;food game,&quot; giving dating advice for men, cooking tips, and easy dinner recipes. Spencer&#x27;s dating tips have been featured in &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;. He also frequently writes dating tips for Neil Strauss, Carlos Xuma, and Singles Warehouse.

==Personal life==
Spencer was once married to Kendra Benham, who worked alongside him in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; as Maya Ibuki. Spencer holds a brown belt in aikido and a 2nd-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Spencer is married to an entrepreneur, Kim MacKenzie, as of October 4, 2014. He is a foodie and has a website called &quot;DontKillYourDate.com.&quot; Spike and Kim have two sons, one named Declan, who was born on July 29, 2017, and another named Colton Christopher, who was born on February 4, 2021, in Australia.

<text>The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire is an order of chivalry founded by Queen Victoria on 1 January 1878. The Order includes members of three classes:

#Knight Grand Commander (GCIE)
#Knight Commander (KCIE)
#Companion (CIE)

Appointments terminated after 1947, the year that British India became the independent Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. With the death of the last surviving knight, the Maharaja Meghrajji III of Dhrangadhra, the order became dormant in 2010.
The motto of the Order is &quot;Imperatricis auspiciis&quot;, (Latin for &quot;Under the auspices of the Empress&quot;), a reference to Queen Victoria, the first Empress of India. The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the British Indian Empire; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India.

==History==
The British founded the Order in 1878 to reward British and native officials who served in British India. The Order originally had only one class (Companion), but expanded to comprise two classes in 1887. The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India (founded in 1861); consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter.

On 15 February 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire formally became &quot;The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire&quot; and was divided into two classes: knights commander and companions, with the following as knights commander, listed up to 1906

Emperor Gojong of Korea was made an honorary Knight Grand Commander on 17 December 1900.

==Ceasement==
Appointments to both the Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire ceased after 14 August 1947. As the last Grand Master of the orders, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma was also the last known individual to have publicly worn the stars of a Knight Grand Commander of both orders, during the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee celebrations in 1977. There are no living members of the order.

* The last Grand Master of the Order was Rear Admiral The 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma (later promoted and created Admiral of the Fleet The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma; 1900–1979), the last Viceroy of India. Lord Mountbatten was killed in an IRA bombing in County Sligo on 27 August 1979.

*The last surviving GCIE, Maharaja Sri Sir Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma (1912–1991), the Maharaja of Travancore, died on 19 July 1991 in Trivandrum.
*The last surviving KCIE, Maharaja Sri Sir the Maharaja of Dhrangadhra (1923–2010), the Maharaja of Dhrangadhra-Halvad, died at Dhrangadhra on 1 August 2010.
*The last surviving CIE, Sir Ian Dixon Scott (1909–2002), died on 3 March 2002.

The fictional characters Purun Dass, invented by Rudyard Kipling, and Harry Paget Flashman, invented by George MacDonald Fraser, were KCIEs; Kipling&#x27;s engineer Findlayson in &quot;The Day&#x27;s Work&quot; (1908) aspires to the CIE.

==Composition==

The British sovereign serves as Sovereign of the Order. The grand master held the next-most senior rank; the position was held, &quot;ex officio&quot;, by the viceroy of India. Members of the first class were titled &quot;Knight Grand Commander&quot; rather than &quot;Knight Grand Cross&quot; so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the order.

At the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class, that of Companion, with no quota imposed. In 1886, the Order was divided into the two classes of knights commander (50 at any given time) and companions (no quota). The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; the composition of the other two classes remained the same. The statute also provided that it was &quot;competent for Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, at Her or their pleasure, to appoint any Princes of the Blood Royal, being descendants of His late Majesty King George the First, as Extra Knights Grand Commander&quot;.

By Letters Patent of 2 Aug 1886, the number of knights commander was increased to 82, while commanders were limited to 20 nominations per year (40 for 1903 only). Membership was expanded by letters patent of 10 June 1897, which permitted up to 32 knights grand commander. A special statute of 21 October 1902 permitted up to 92 knights commander, but continued to limit the number of nominations of commanders to 20 in any successive year. On 21 December 1911, in connection with the Delhi Durbar, the limits were increased to 40 knights grand commander, 120 knights commander, and 40 nominations of companions in any successive year.

British officials and soldiers were eligible for appointment, as were rulers of Indian Princely States. Generally, the rulers of the more important states were appointed knights grand commander of the Order of the Star of India, rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire. Women, save the princely rulers, were ineligible for appointment to the order. Female princely rulers were admitted as &quot;knights&quot; rather than as &quot;dames&quot; or &quot;ladies&quot;. Other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed as well.

==Vestments and accoutrements==
Members of the order wore elaborate costumes on important ceremonial occasions:
* The &quot;mantle&quot;, worn only by knights grand commander, comprised dark blue satin lined with white silk. On the left side was a representation of the star (see photo at right).
* The &quot;collar&quot;, also worn only by knights grand commander, was made of gold. It was composed of alternating golden elephants, Indian roses and peacocks.
At less important occasions, simpler insignia were used:
*The &quot;star&quot;, worn only by knights grand commander and knights commander, had ten points, including rays of gold and silver for knights grand commander, and of plain silver for knights commander. In the centre was an image of Victoria surrounded by a dark blue ring with the motto and surmounted by a crown.
*The &quot;badge&quot; was worn by knights grand commander on a dark blue riband, or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip, and by knights commander and companions from a dark blue ribbon around the neck. It included a five-petalled crown-surmounted red flower, with the image of Victoria surrounded by a dark blue ring with the motto at the centre.
The insignia of most other British chivalric orders incorporate a cross; the Order of the Indian Empire does not, in deference to India&#x27;s non-Christian tradition.

==Precedence and privileges==

Members of all classes of the order were assigned positions in the order of precedence. Wives of members of all classes also featured on the order of precedence, as did sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of knights grand commander and knights commander. (See order of precedence in England and Wales for the exact positions.)

Knights grand commander used the post-nominal &quot;GCIE&quot;, knights commander &quot;KCIE&quot;, and companions &quot;CIE.&quot; Knights grand commander and knights commander were entitled to the prefix &quot;Sir&quot;. Wives of knights grand commander and knights commander could prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames. Such forms were not used by peers and Indian princes, except when the names of the former were written out in their fullest forms.

Knights grand commander were also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, and could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Knights commander and companions were permitted to display the circlet, but not the collar, surrounding their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet.

==Notable appointees==
* In 1931 The Raja Dhau Raghubir Bakshi Singh was created a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire and was given the title of C.I.E. He was the Raja of Bharatpur and reigned from 27 March 1929 to 15 August 1947. He was also senior member of the council and president ().

<doc id="547027" wikidata="Q1764065" url="?curid=547027" title="NCAA women's water polo championship">
<text>The NCAA women&#x27;s water polo championship is the annual tournament hosted by the NCAA to determine the team national champion of women&#x27;s collegiate water polo among its members in the United States, held each year since 2001.

Unlike most NCAA sports, only one National Collegiate championship is held each season with teams from Division I, Division II, and Division III competing together.

Stanford has been the most successful program, with 9 championships; UCLA has the second most (8), followed by USC (6). One of these three California schools has won the championship every year since the tournament began in 2001.

While the tournament often includes teams from around the country, most programs are located within the state of California, and no school from outside California has ever surpassed third place or participated in the NCAA Women&#x27;s Water Polo Championship game. Indeed, only twice has a school other than Stanford, UCLA, or USC participated in the championship game: Loyola Marymount who lost to USC in 2004 and California (the other California-based Pac-12 school) who lost to Stanford in 2011.

==Format==
Seven conferences have teams competing in women&#x27;s water polo: the Big West Conference, the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA), the single-sport Golden Coast Conference, the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) and the Western Water Polo Association (WWPA). Some teams compete at Division III, either as members of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference or as an independent. Teams qualify by either winning their respective conference tournament or receiving one of the few at large bids available. 

==Champions==

==Team titles==


==Result by school and year==

<text>National power is defined as the sum of all resources available to a nation in the pursuit of national objectives. Assessing the national power of political entities was already a matter of relevance during the classical antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and today. Classics Shang Yang, Guan Zhong and Chanakya, widely discussed the power of state. Many other classics, such as Mozi, Appian, Pliny the Elder, also concerned the subject. Herodotes described whence derives the power of Babylon. The considerations of Hannibal on the matter is found in Titus Livy.

==Elements of national power==
National power stems from various &quot;elements&quot;, also called &quot;instruments&quot; or &quot;attributes&quot;; these may be put into two groups based on their applicability and origin - &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;social&quot;.
* Natural:
** Geography
** Resources
** Population
* Social:
**Economic
**Political
**Military
** Psychological (National morale)
** Informational

===Geography===
Important facets of geography such as location, climate, topography, size and resources play major roles in the ability of a nation to gain national power. The relation between foreign policy and geographic space gave rise to the discipline of geopolitics including the concepts of lebensraum and &quot;grossraum&quot;. The latter is a region with natural resources sufficient for autarky.

Space has a strategic value. Russia&#x27;s size permitted it to trade space for time during the Great Patriotic War. To a less extent, the same is true for China in the war against Japan.

Location has an important bearing on foreign policy of a nation. The presence of a water obstacle provided protection to states such as Ancient Rome, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States. The geographic protection allowed Rome, Japan, and the United States to follow isolationist policies, and Britain the policy of non-involvement in Europe. The presence of large accessible seaboards also permitted these nations to build strong navies and expand their territories peacefully or by conquest. In contrast, Poland, with no obstacle for its powerful neighbours, lost its independence from 1795 to 1918 and again from 1939 to 1989.

Since Antiquity, the importance of climate was stressed, with the temperate zone being regarded as favoring great powers. Aristotle in &quot;Politics&quot; argued that the Greeks, placed in the temperate zone, qualify for world domination. Pliny the Elder observed that in the temperate zone, there are governments, which the outer races never have possessed.

The temperate zone as power factor remained widely stressed in the modern research. In fact, all modern great powers have been located in the temperate zone. A.F.K. Organski criticized this hypothesis as &quot;an accident of history.&quot; The Industrial Revolution happened, by accident, in the temperate zone and so far, also by accident, there are no major industrial nations outside this zone. But the world will become industrial, &quot;now that the industrial revolution is galloping triumphant throughout the world.&quot;

Organski abandoned the theory of temperate zone as untenable. By contrast, Max Ostrovsky developed it further. He doubted historical accidents. Writing half-a-century after Organski, he noted that the Industrial Revolution is still not &quot;galloping triumphant throughout the world&quot; but remains bound to the temperate zone. Moreover, vast temperate zones of Turkestan and Mongolia do not generate great powers. It appeared that besides the mild temperature, a right amount of rain was necessary, as only humid temperate areas have been sources of great power.

This observation challenged a dominant element of the temperate theory. Most of its proponents believed that temperate climate develops industrious mind. None inquired what rain has to do with mind. Instead of climate developing mind, Ostrovsky replaced mind with cereal agriculture. Rains, he argued, favor cereals rather than human mind, while the productive cereal agriculture favors industry. The more productive is the cereal agriculture, the more manpower is available to industry and other non-agricultural sectors. For this reason, and not &quot;by accident,&quot; the Industrial Revolution followed the modern Agricultural Revolution in time and space and is not &quot;galloping triumphant&quot; anywhere in the world beyond the humid temperate areas. In size, Russia is larger than the United States, but its temperate zone with optimum rainfall is smaller, as most of the territory is in latitudes well north. All things being equal, Ostrovsky concluded, who rules the largest rainy temperate zone, rules the world. But all things are seldom equal. For this reason, he avoided geographic determinism and formulized an indicator of national power which combines climatic conditions and organizational level (see &quot;National power indicator&quot; below).

== Measurements ==
Depending on the interaction of the individual elements of national power, attempts can be made to classify states and assign them a status in the international order of states. Globally important states with dominant positions in all or almost all elements of national power are called superpowers. This term was applied to the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. In the 21st century, it is also increasingly applied to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Other status classification terms for states include, in descending hierarchy, world powers, great powers, regional powers, middle powers, and small powers. For states or alliances with almost absolute power, the term hyperpower is used.

Despite the difficulty of the task and the multidimensional nature of power, several attempts have been made to express the power of states in objective rankings and indexes based on statistical indicators.

=== Composite Index of National Capability ===

The Composite Index of National Capability (CINC) was conceived by J. David Singer in 1963. It includes the six factors of total population, urban population, iron and steel production, primary energy consumption, military expenditure and number of soldiers and calculates an index from them. His methodology is considered outdated, however, as he only takes into account &quot;hard&quot; power factors and indicators such as steel production no longer have the same significance as in the early 20th century.
Criticism: CINC suggests, “nonsensically,” that Israel is, and has always been, one of the weakest countries in the Middle East; Russia dominated Europe throughout the 1990s, with more power than Germany, France, and the United Kingdom combined; and China has dominated the world since 1996 and by 2018 twice exceeded the power of the United States.

=== National Power Ranking of Countries ===
The National Power Ranking of Countries was published in a paper by the University of Warsaw and the University of Wroclaw. It divides countries into the categories of economic, military and geopolitical power, which is derived from statistical indicators. The report also analyzes the evolution of the distribution of power in the world since 1992 and makes a forecast for 2050, noting an increasing shift of power from the Western world to the Asia-Pacific region.
=== State Power Index ===
The State Power Index was developed by Piotr Arak and Grzegorz Lewicki and takes into account the factors of economy, military, land area, population, cultural influence, natural resources and diplomacy, which is combined into an overall index.
=== World Power Index ===
The World Power Index (WPI) is a numerical expression that refers the accumulation of national capacities that a State possesses for the exercise of its power in the international system.

The WPI is the result of adding 18 indicators, which are organized through three composite indices:

* Material Capacities Index (MCI),
* Semimaterial Capacities Index (SCI),
* Immaterial Capabilities Index (ICI).

The WPI is presented as an analysis technique that, being quantitative, seeks to help overcome the hermeneutics that underlies the subjective interpretation of national power. In this way, the WPI contributes to the accurate comparison of the national capacities of States and the study of their position in the international structure.

=== National power indicator ===
This indicator was developed by Max Ostrovsky. He reduced numerous indexes to one basic indicator—cereal tonnage produced by one percent of national manpower. He argues that this indicator is defined by environmental conditions and organizational level and in its turn defines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural activities.

==Financial information==
Expeditors became a publicly traded company in 1984 with the listing of its shares on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol EXPD and were named to the NASDAQ-100 in 2002. In November 2023, Expeditors transferred the listing of its common stock to the New York Stock Exchange NYSE, keeping the same symbol &quot;EXPD&quot;. During their first year as a public company, Expeditors reported more than $50 million in gross revenues and $2.1 million in net earnings. Expeditors is currently #299 on the Fortune 500. Total revenues exceeded 10 billion ($10.116 billion) in 2021.

They are known in the financial services community for their unconventional and entertaining SEC filings, which are rumored to be written by former CEO Peter Rose himself, as well as its responses to questions submitted to the company, which are placed on Expeditors&#x27; investor website. Rose announced his retirement in March 2014 as CEO, with his retirement as Chairman effective May 2015.

==Compensation structure==
Expeditors maintains a compensation structure that is unique to the logistics industry. According to their 2003 annual report, &quot;Each of the Company&#x27;s branches are independent profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentive-based compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch. This compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services [...] are done in an objective manner on a fair value basis.&quot;

<doc id="547045" wikidata="Q7624063" url="?curid=547045" title="Strip-built">
<text>Strip-built, or &quot;strip-plank epoxy&quot;, is a method of boat building. Also known as cold molding, the strip-built method is commonly used for canoes and kayaks, but also suitable for larger boats. The process involves securing narrow, flexible strips of wood edge-to-edge around temporary formers. The temporary formers are usually created via a process called &quot;lofting&quot; whereby a set of tables is used to generate the shapes of the formers. The strips are glued edge-to-edge with epoxy. It is effectively a modern form of carvel which needs no caulking and which is both stiffer and more watertight. In a small boat, there will be just one layer of strip-planking, but larger vessels may have two or three layers which, (being a pre-shaped marine ply), forms a light, strong, and torsionally stiff monococque.

A modern development of this construction procedure is &quot;radius chine plywood&quot;, a method devised by yacht designer Dudley Dix which gives a fair hull that is both light and stiff. Dix uses this boat-building method for most of his designs.

== Smaller boats ==
These are the most popular among boatbuilders. Some professional builders also offer both kits and finished boats. The canoes are constructed by gluing together 1/4&quot; x 3/4&quot; strips of wood over a building jig consisting of station molds that define the shape of the hull. The forms are cut as a series of cross-sections of the final design and set up along a &quot;strongback&quot; or another solid base. The strips are shaped with bead and cove router bits. Stripping begins at the sheer line and finishes with &quot;the football&quot;, a pattern of planks at the bottom of the boat. The strips are edge-glued to each other, being held in place with nails, staples, or simply clamped to the forms. Once the strips are glued together, and the staples/nails removed, the inside and outside are sanded fair. Fiberglass and epoxy are applied to the canoe inside and out. The fiberglass covering is transparent, waterproof, and allowing the wood strips to be seen. The strips are usually cedar but can be any type of wood. Contrasting woods are sometimes used as accent strips. The last steps in construction is to install the seats, thwarts, and gunwales. Finally, a coat of marine-grade polyurethane is applied to protect the wood and epoxy from ultraviolet light.

In the 1950s, this process for building canoes and kayaks was adapted from ship/boat building techniques, and refined by a group of Minnesota canoe racers, primarily: Eugene Jensen, Irwin C.(Buzzy) Peterson, and Karl Ketter.
== Larger boats ==
Strip-plank epoxy planking may be found on large yachts such as the Brady 45 catamaran, a plans-built Australian design with Indonesian cedar planking. For a large catamaran, this construction method produces a tough hull with an inherent buoyancy. Once the strip-plank monocoque is completed, it is covered inside and out with glass fiber matting and epoxy resin. Working primarily with wood is much more pleasant for the builder than building exclusively with fiberglass, which can cause irritation and respiratory problems. Also, for a one-off constructor, it makes little sense to build a female mold; it is simpler and cheaper to manufacture a wooden jig that may be discarded afterward.

<doc id="547048" wikidata="Q1528023" url="?curid=547048" title="Hugo Award for Best Fanzine">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Fanzine is given each year for non professionally edited magazines, or &quot;fanzines&quot;, related to science fiction or fantasy which has published four or more issues with at least one issue appearing in the previous calendar year. Awards were also once given out for professional magazines in the professional magazine category, and since 1984 have been awarded for semi-professional magazines in the semiprozine category; several magazines that were nominated for or won the fanzine category have gone on to be nominated for or win the semiprozine category since it was established. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The award was first presented in 1955, and has been given annually since except for in 1958. A &quot;fanzine&quot; is defined for the award as a magazine that does not meet the Hugo award&#x27;s criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average press run of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of any one person, had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine. This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for fan writing and fan art. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fanzine category has been included each year.

During the 77 nomination years, including Retro Hugo years, 141 magazines run by hundreds of editors have been nominated. Of these, 44 magazines have won, including ties. &quot;File 770&quot; and &quot;Locus&quot; have each won 8 times, the most wins of any magazine. &quot;File 770&quot; also holds the record for most nominations at 31; &quot;Locus&quot; has been nominated 13 times. &quot;Mimosa&quot; has won 6 of 14 nominations, &quot;Ansible&quot; has won 5 out of 11, and &quot;Science Fiction Review&quot; has won 4 of 12; they are the only other magazines to win more than twice. &quot;Challenger&quot; has the most nominations without winning at 12; the next highest is &quot;FOSFAX&quot; with 7. As editor of &quot;Locus&quot; Charles N. Brown has won 8 of 13 nominations, though he shared 8 of those awards with Dena Brown. Richard E. Geis has won 6 of 15 nominations for his work on &quot;Science Fiction Review&quot;, &quot;Psychotic&quot;, and &quot;The Alien Critic&quot;; Mike Glyer has won 8 of 31 for editing &quot;File 770&quot;; David Langford has won 5 of 12 for work on &quot;Ansible&quot; and &quot;Twil-Ddu&quot;; and Richard Lynch and Nicki Lynch have both won 6 of 14 nominations for &quot;Mimosa;&quot; Christopher J Garcia has been nominated 18 times for both &quot;The Drink Tank&quot; and &quot;Journey Planet&quot;, winning once for each, with James Bacon appearing on 15 of those nominations. Guy H. Lillian III has the most nominations without winning at 12 for &quot;Challenger&quot;.

==Selection==
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1956 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1957 all of the candidates were recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the &quot;year in literature&quot; article corresponding with when the work was eligible. Entries with a yellow background won the award for that year; those with a gray background are the other nominees on the short-list.

Note that six magazines are listed under multiple names: &quot;Psychotic&quot; was later renamed to &quot;Science Fiction Review&quot;, &quot;Zenith&quot; was renamed to &quot;Zenith Speculation&quot; and later to &quot;Speculation&quot;, &quot;Algol&quot; was renamed to &quot;Starship&quot;, &quot;Tangent&quot; was renamed to &quot;Tangent Online&quot; when it switched from a print magazine to an online one, and &quot;Cry of the Nameless&quot;, a club bulletin for &quot;The Nameless Ones&quot;, was renamed to &quot;Cry&quot; when it began publishing more general material. No other magazines have been nominated under multiple names. Those magazines are sorted under the first name they were nominated as.

  *   Winners and joint winners

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year, if no awards were originally given that year. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

<text>The Barra Isles, also known as the Bishop&#x27;s Isles, are a small archipelago in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. They lie south of the island of Barra, for which they are named. The group consists of nine islands and numerous rocky islets, skerries, and sea stacks.

In 1427, the Lords of the Isles awarded the lairdship of Barra (and its associated islands) to Clan MacNeil of Barra. However, after acts of piracy by the MacNeils, King James VI transferred ownership of the southern archipelago to the Bishop of the Isles, hence the islands became known as the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Isles&quot;. Murray writes that they belonged &quot;to the Bishop of the Isles &quot;de jure&quot; although to MacNeil &quot;de facto&quot;&quot;.

Many of the islands are extremely small; only the largest, Vatersay – which is now linked by the Vatersay Causeway to Barra – remains inhabited. Berneray (also known as Barra Head), Pabbay, Sandray and Mingulay have been inhabited in the past. The four smallest named islands are Flodday, Lingay, Muldoanich and Uineasan.

The Barra Isles are featured in several Viking sagas.

In addition to the larger islands there are various smaller islets, stacks and skerries. Biruaslum is a stack to the west of Vatersay. It reaches in height and there is a ruined prehistoric fort on the southern side. Francis G. Thompson describes it as &quot;high and virtually inaccessible&quot;; James Fisher mentions a &quot;fulmar flying up and down its tiny cliff.&quot;

<doc id="547075" wikidata="Q1650920" url="?curid=547075" title="Waheguru">
<text>Waheguru (, pronunciation: , literally meaning &quot;Wow Guru&quot;, figuratively translated to mean &quot;Wonderful God&quot; or &quot;Wonderful Lord&quot;) is a term used in Sikhism to refer to God as described in &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;. It is the most common term to refer to God in modern Sikhism.

== Meaning ==
The meaning of the word (usually spelled in English as &quot;Waheguru&quot;) is traditionally explained as &#x27;wondrous!&#x27; (Punjabi word analogous to &quot;wow&quot; in English), and &quot;guru&quot;, Sanskrit for &#x27;teacher, spiritual guide, God&#x27;, which taken together are said to carry the meaning, &#x27;Wondrous Lord&#x27;. It is built upon an expression of awe and amazement of the divine. Another explanation for the term&#x27;s meaning is that it refers to a great instructor who takes away the darkness from their pupil and enlightens them.

Waheguru is described and envisioned as a formless and omnipresent deity by Sikhs with whom a devotee is able to establish a personal relationship with by following the teachings of the Sikh Gurus. Waheguru is considered to be ultimate goodness, into which the purified soul merges whilst evil is vanquished.

== History ==
The hymns to Waheguru contained in &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; have been composed by Bhatt Gayand.

== Usage ==
The word is also used in Sikhism as a main mantra and is called &quot;gurmantra&quot; or &quot;gurmantar&quot;.

The term also finds usage in the &quot;jaikara&quot; (battle cry), greeting, and parting phrase introduced by Guru Gobind Singh: &quot;Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh&quot; (translated as &#x27;the Khalsa belongs to God and victory belongs to God&#x27;). This phrase is used in the &quot;Amrit Sanchar&quot; ceremony, the Sikh baptismal ritual for initiation into the Khalsa order.

<doc id="547099" wikidata="Q6565347" url="?curid=547099" title="List of CBC Television stations">
<text>CBC Television is a Canadian English language public television network made up of fourteen owned-and-operated stations. Some privately owned stations were formerly affiliated with the network until as late as August 2016. This is a table listing of CBC Television&#x27;s stations, arranged by market. This article also includes former self-supporting stations later operating as rebroadcasters of regional affiliates, stations no longer affiliated with CBC Television, and stations purchased by the CBC that formerly operated as private CBC Television affiliates.

The station&#x27;s virtual channel number (if applicable) follows the call letters. The number in parentheses that follows is the station&#x27;s actual digital channel number; digital channels allocated for future use listed in parentheses are italicized.

CBC Television&#x27;s O&amp;Os operate for the most part as a seamless national service, with few deviations from the national schedule. The network&#x27;s former private affiliates had some flexibility to carry a reduced schedule of network programming if they chose.

Over the years the CBC has gradually reduced the number of private affiliates; until 2006 this usually involved either opening a new station (or new rebroadcast transmitters) in a market previously served by a private affiliate, or purchasing the affiliate outright. In most cases since 2006 (when CFJC-TV disaffiliated), it declined to open new rebroadcasters in the affected markets for budgetary reasons, and since then has wound down its remaining affiliation agreements, with the last expiring on August 31, 2016. These disaffiliations, along with the CBC&#x27;s decision to shut down its TV rebroadcaster network in 2012, have significantly reduced the network&#x27;s terrestrial coverage; however, under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations, all cable, satellite, and IPTV service providers are required to include a CBC Television signal in their basic service, even if one is not available terrestrially in the applicable service area.

Since September 2014, all CBC Television O&amp;Os have also been separately affiliated with the temporary and (since April 2015) permanent part-time networks operated by Rogers Media for the purposes of distributing the Rogers-produced &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcasts. This was required by the CRTC as, under the current arrangement for National Hockey League rights between Rogers and the CBC, Rogers exercises editorial control and sells all advertising time during the &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcasts, even though for promotional purposes they are still treated as part of the CBC Television schedule. Although the CRTC decision which approved the permanent network only referred to stations owned by the CBC itself, CBC Television&#x27;s private affiliates also continued to carry the Rogers-produced &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcasts until disaffiliation.

<doc id="547103" wikidata="Q1732919" url="?curid=547103" title="Barra Head">
<text>Barra Head, also known as Berneray (; ), is the southernmost island of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. Within the Outer Hebrides, it forms part of the Barra Isles archipelago. Originally, Barra Head only referred to the southernmost headland of Berneray but is now a common name for the entire island. The highest point of the island is Sotan, a Marilyn.

There are numerous prehistoric structures on the island and permanent occupation by 20–50 individuals occurred throughout the historic period, peaking in the 19th century. The economy of the residents was based on agriculture, fishing and fowling. The cliffs provide nesting sites for seabirds in such profusion that Berneray has been designated as a Special Protection Area.

The Barra Head Lighthouse, designed by Robert Stevenson, has operated since 1833. From 1931 to 1980 Barra Head was inhabited only by the lighthouse keepers and their wives but the lighthouse is now automated and the island completely uninhabited. The rough seas that surround the island have been used to test prototype lifeboats.

==Etymology==
The derivation of the modern name is straightforward, the Old Norse name meaning &quot;Bjorn&#x27;s island&quot; becoming &quot;Beàrnaraigh&quot; in Gaelic and then &quot;Berneray&quot; as an anglicisation. However, as is often the case with Hebridean island names, there are a number of additional complications. There are two fuller Gaelic names – &quot;Beàrnaraigh Cheann Bharraigh&quot; and &quot;Beàrnaraigh an Easbaig&quot; meaning &quot;Berneray of Barra Head&quot; and &quot;Berneray of the Bishop&quot; respectively. The former refers to Barra Head the southernmost promontory of the island and the latter name is a reference to the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Isles&quot; an alternative name for the &quot;Barra Isles&quot;, of which archipelago Berneray is a member. &quot;Barra Head&quot; alone is an English language alternative to Berneray for the island name. The Inverness-shire Ordnance Survey Name Book, volume 2, of 1876–1878, notes that &quot;The Island of Berneray is sometimes called Barra Head but Berneray is the correct designation.&quot;

==Geography and geology==
Berneray lies to the west of the Sea of the Hebrides and south of Mingulay across the Sound of Berneray, which has a strong tidal stream. The wedge-shaped island is long and wide. The topography lacks variety, there being no valley or bays and the few streams are very small. Most of the island consists of gneiss, although the lighthouse was constructed of rock from a small granite quarry.

The seabed to the west is a continuation of the gneiss platform with a depth of between . The sea floor is largely devoid of sand and there is some evidence of scouring by icebergs. This rocky platform extends south of Barra Head by at least . Due to glacial action the sea channel to the east is significantly deeper than the open ocean to the west, reaching up to .

The rocky north coast has a small landing place at Leac na Fealia to the west and a small jetty at Achduin further east. From there a track leads westward and upward across the slope of the island to the lighthouse. To the west of Achduin the land is relatively flat and low-lying, the area known as &quot;The Aird&quot; ending at Nisam Point which overlooks the little islands of Rubha Niosaim and Sgeir Mhor.
The south coast is dominated by high cliffs, which rise to at Skate Point (&quot;Rubha Sgait&quot;) in the south west. Barra Head itself is the southern prominence located mid-way along the south coast. The highest point of the island is Sotan, a Marilyn whose summit lies above high cliffs between Barra Head and Skate Point. This eminence is easily reached from the track that leads from Achduin to the lighthouse that passes just to the north of the summit, which is only from the cliff edge. The skerry of Bird Rock guards the coast far below. The lighthouse is located near the prominence of Sròn an Duin, just east of Skate Point and above the narrow chasm of Sloc na Bèiste (ravine of the monster).

Visiting in 1868 H. J. Elwes wrote:

It was the grandest sight I ever experienced, to look out of the lighthouse on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce the appearance of a heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.

==History==
Berneray was inhabited from prehistoric times until the 20th century; Historic Scotland have identified eighty-three archaeological sites on the island, the majority being of a pre-medieval date. There are four chambered tombs, five cists and five other sites assumed to be burial cairns, suggesting a significant settlement in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. The fort of Dùn Briste (the broken fort) lies to the north west and a second site nearby dating to the Iron Age was largely destroyed during the construction of the lighthouse. Visiting in the late 17th century the writer Martin Martin described the latter as &quot;having a vacuity round the walls, divided in little apartments&quot;. A century later Edward MacQueen wrote that he believed it had served &quot;as a pharos or watch tower&quot;.
There is also the presumed site of a chapel near MacLean&#x27;s Point (just east of the landing place) where an incised cross, tentatively dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries was found. Archaeological evidence of the Norse presence in the Hebrides is scant, but boat shaped stone settings found not far from the chapel may be graves from this period of occupation.

Referring to his own time, Martin suggested that life on &quot;Bernera&quot; was not unduly difficult. &quot;It excels other islands of the same extent for cultivation and fishing. The natives never go a fishing while Macneil or his steward is in the island, lest seeing their plenty of fish, perhaps they might take occasion to raise their rents.&quot; In the 18th century the population was over fifty, with settlement concentrated around the north east coast. The 1841 census recorded a population of 30, rising to 56 in 1881 and then declining again to 36 in nine houses by 1891. During the 19th century the permanently resident population (see below) remained stable at about 20 in two or three families. The number fell to 17 by 1901, with the last native islanders leaving about 1910. From this point the three families of the lighthouse keepers were the only residents and the island became uninhabited with the 1980 automation of the light.

===Overview of population trends===

Notes:
:Population (a) includes permanent residents only and was not recorded in 1901.
:Population (b) also includes lighthouse keepers and, given that many of the censuses were taken in April, temporarily resident fishermen.

==Traditional economy and culture==

During the 19th century agriculture was based on crops of barley, potatoes, oats, turnips and cabbages and livestock including sheep and cattle. Ponies were kept, although their use may have been to transport materials to the lighthouse, and goats were also recorded in 1863. Berneray lacks peat, which had to be brought over from Mingulay at considerable effort. The harvest of the seas remained important, with the island a base for exploiting the rich stocks of white fish by fishermen from several local islands. Seabirds were also an important part of the economy, supplying both food and feathers for sale. Such was the abundance that in 1868 a single fowler caught 600 birds in six to eight hours.

Visiting in 1818, William MacGillivray, professor of Natural History at Aberdeen University wrote:

On reaching Berneray we landed and soon after betook ourselves to a hut which we found cleared for our reception. We dined on roasted mutton, wild fowls&#x27; eggs, bread, butter and whisky. The goodman of the house came home with a basketful of eggs from the rocks, and some birds he had caught.

The travel writer Isabella Bird arrived in 1863 aboard the &quot;Shamrock&quot; receiving an &quot;outrageous welcome&quot; from the islanders, despite the fact that amongst the Gaelic-speaking locals only a few had &quot;some very lame sentences in English&quot;. She wrote approvingly that her hosts were &quot;well-dressed, cleanly and healthy looking&quot; and of the &quot;delicious cream, in large clean, wooden bowls.&quot; Duncan Sinclair, the only Protestant on the island purchased a Bible and there was much bartering and bargaining with the islanders paying for their purchases in dried fish. Bird concluded that the island was:

Far out into the Atlantic, exposed to its fullest fury, and generally inaccessible, yet has nursed a population before, rather than behind, those of the other Hebrides. Without any advantages or other religious ordinances than are supplied by the annual visit of a priest from Barra, these very interesting people thirst for education, and would make considerable sacrifices to obtain it.
In 1851 several of the island&#x27;s children were described as &quot;scholars at home&quot; and later some youngsters attended the school on Mingulay. The Barra School Board created a &quot;sub-school&quot; on Berneray but it can never have had even as many as ten children in attendance and it closed in 1887 after a few years of operation.

==Lighthouse==

Barra Head Lighthouse identifies the southern entrance to The Minch, roughly halfway between the Eilean Glas and Rinns of Islay lighthouses. The stone tower stands on the west side of the island, at the top of a very steep cliff, making the light above sea level, with a range of . There is no shallow water west of Berneray to break the blow of the Atlantic storms and small fish are sometimes thrown onto the grass on the cliff top. In 1836 Sir Archibald Geikie recorded the movement of a block of gneiss across of ground during a violent storm.
Designed by Robert Stevenson and built by James Smith of Inverness the light was first exhibited on 15 October 1833. The oil-burning light was converted to incandescent in 1906 and the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation on 23 October 1980, when the last keepers were withdrawn.
Due to the dangerous landing conditions, Barra Head lighthouse was re-classified by the RNLI as a &quot;Rock Station&quot; early in the 20th century. Two small boats had been swamped and lost in the enormous swell by the slipway at the landing place. The regulations associated with this change prevented both alongside landings by tenders and the lighthouse men keeping dinghies onshore. The departure of the last of the crofting families meant an end to regular links by sea and the regular mist and fog rendered signalling unreliable. A system of wireless communications with Castlebay on Barra was therefore proposed and installed by 1925.

The pier was built in the late 1930s with the approach of war, when a sophisticated radar system was installed to guard the Western Approaches. This involved the landing of hundreds of steel girders and drums containing steel cables used to create three large radar masts, and a robust &quot;Scots Derrick&quot; was erected to crane them ashore. 
A small walled cemetery was constructed halfway between the lighthouse and the summit of Sotan for the keepers. This contains the grave of a visiting inspector and those of a number of the keepers&#x27; children. A Blenheim bomber crashed into the cliffs nearby during World War II, but the wreck was not discovered until many years later by a rock climber.

==Lifeboats==
In the early 1970s a research project sponsored by BP into a prototype safety boat for Barra Head also assisted the RNLI in developing the Atlantic 21 class lifeboat. The boat used was a Halmatic Atlantic 21 MKIII modified for long-range operations and with full offshore capability. The project involved multi-organisation co-operation and included Halmatic themselves, HM Coastguard and the Royal Marines Amphibious Trials and Testing Unit.

In 2008 the Barra RNLI Life Boat, &quot;Edna Windsor&quot; was featured on a series of Royal Mail stamps. The first class stamp shows the Severn class lifeboat in action in the Sound of Berneray south west of Barra in a swell and a wind.

==Natural history==
The National Trust for Scotland purchased the island in 2000 from a local crofters&#x27; syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company who had owned the island since 1955. The NTS were able to acquire it through a bequest by Miss J. M. Fawcitt &quot;to provide an area of natural beauty in memory of her parents and the courage of her late brother, Bernard&quot;. In 2009 the NTS removed all the sheep from the island, citing the difficulties of maintaining the flock in such a remote location.

Berneray and Mingulay form an important breeding site for around a hundred thousand pairs of seabirds, and are especially important for the razorbill, the two islands having at least 2.0% of the UK&#x27;s breeding population in 1985. Other species present include a variety of gulls, guillemots, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and (since 1899) fulmars. The island is largely covered by maritime grassland, with some machair and heath. Primrose, violets, yellow flag iris and celandine grow abundantly and grey seals are regularly seen by the landing cove. The island is designated as an SSSI and (with Mingulay) is a Special Protection Area.

===Important Bird Area===
The island (along with neighbouring Mingulay) has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding populations of several species of seabirds.

==Notable residents==

The island&#x27;s best known former resident is Peter Sinclair, aka &quot;Pàdraig Mòr&quot; or the &quot;Barra Giant&quot;. He was measured at 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) tall aged seventeen in 1866. He joined a travelling show, but disliked the publicity and returned to the islands to run a dairy in Castlebay in the summer and spend the winters at his home on Berneray.
