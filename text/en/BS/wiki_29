<text>The Trier University (), in the German city of Trier, was founded in 1473. Closed in 1798 by order of the then French administration in Trier, the university was re-established in 1970 after a hiatus of some 172 years. The new university campus is located on top of the Tarforst heights, an urban district on the outskirts of the city. The university has six faculties with around 470 faculty members. In 2006 around 14,000 students were matriculated, with 43.5% of the student body male and 56.5% female; the percentage of foreign students was approximately 15.5%.

== History ==

=== Historical university ===
In 1455 Pope Nicholas V granted the Archbishop of Trier, , the right to establish a university. The University of Trier was founded 16 March 1473. Battling financial problems for decades, the university was acquired by the Jesuits in 1560. They emphasized the philosophical and theological faculties at the expense of medicine and law. In the 1580s Peter Binsfeld was president of the university. In the 1730s Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim was also a faculty member. After the French occupation of the Rhineland, the French administration ordered the universities of Cologne, Mainz, Bonn and Trier closed, the last closing on 6 April 1798.

=== Modern university ===
After a hiatus of some 172 years the University of Trier was re-established in 1970 by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate as a constituent member of the twin University of Trier-Kaiserslautern, with 360 students matriculating in Trier on 15 October 1970. In 1975 the twin university was split into two independent universities. In 1977, the current university campus in Tarforst was opened and during the 1990s a nearby former French military hospital complex (dating from the French military presence in Germany following the Second World War) was acquired by the university and now forms a second campus, dubbed &quot;Campus II&quot;.

=== University seal ===
The modern university still uses the seal of the historical university in its corporate design. It contains the Latin motto &quot;&quot; (God completes the favors of wisdom from the city of Trier). In 2000 an alternative logo incorporating that seal was introduced, but this met with resistance.

== Faculties ==
The university is divided into six faculties (&quot;Fachbereiche&quot;).

* FB I – Pedagogy, Philosophy, Psychology (c. 2300 students)
* FB II – Linguistics, Literature, Media (c. 2700 students)
* FB III – Egyptology, Papyrology, History, Archeology, Art history, Politics (c. 1700 students)
* FB IV – Economics, Business, Sociology, Mathematics, Computer Science (c. 3300 students)
* FB V – Law (c. 1800 students)
* FB VI – Geography, Geosciences (c. 1600 students)

There is also a Faculty of (Roman Catholic) Theology, affiliated to the university but administratively independent. It has about 300 students.

== Student demographics ==

* WS 2001/02: 11,867 students
* WS 2002/03: 12,660 students
* WS 2003/04: 13,082 students
* WS 2004/05: 13,327 students
* WS 2005/06: 13,755 students
* WS 2006/07: 13,932 students
* WS 2007/08: 13,982 students
* WS 2008/09: 14,639 students
* WS 2009/10: 14,612 students
* WS 2010/11: 14,931 students
* WS 2011/12: 15,260 students
* WS 2012/13: 15,165 students

While there is a considerable number of foreign students in Trier, a large majority of students hail from Rhineland-Palatinate and the adjacent German states of Saarland and Northrhine-Westphalia. This situation has been exacerbated by the introduction of tuition fees in all German states except Rhineland-Palatine, with the University of Trier having experienced an increase in the number of students from other German states—especially the neighbouring states—matriculating or transferring there. The SPD, the governing party in Rhineland-Palatinate, does not plan to introduce tuition fees.

== Notable alumni ==

* Mervat Seif el-Din – classical archaeologist and former director of the Graeco-Roman Museum.

== Karl-Marx-University of Trier ==
The General Students Committee (German: &quot;Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss&quot;, or &quot;AStA&quot; for short) put forward a proposal to change the university&#x27;s official name to the &quot;Karl Marx University of Trier&quot; (German: &quot;Karl-Marx-Universität Trier&quot;), in honour of perhaps the city&#x27;s most famous son. Although the proposal was rejected by university authorities, the General Students Committee still referred to the university as &quot;Karl-Marx-Universität Trier&quot;, until a new coalition was formed in the students parliament in 2015.

<doc id="541697" wikidata="Q313495" url="?curid=541697" title="Antipope Constantine II">
<text>Antipope Constantine II (died c. 769) was a Roman prelate who claimed the papacy from 28 June 767 to 6 August 768. He was overthrown through the intervention of the Lombards and tortured before he was condemned and expelled from the Church during the Lateran Council of 769.

Upon the death of Pope Paul I various factions contended to secure the appointment of their respective candidates as pope. Constantine, although a layman, was supported by a group of Tuscan nobles, led by his brother. They secured his election by force of arms. The following spring, local authorities, with Lombard support, succeeded in deposing him. The Lombards then attempted to install their own candidate, a priest named Philip. He, in turn, was overthrown the same day by the local authorities who then elected the churchman Stephen. For a short time Constantine retained some support outside the city, which resulted in armed conflict. The supporters of Stephen had the imprisoned Constantine blinded, which, it seems to be generally allowed, Stephen was unable to hinder. After that, Constantine was held in close confinement in a monastery. He is today considered an antipope.

==Background==

Constantine was born into a noble Roman family in Nepi near Viterbo. He was one of four brothers, of which the most prominent was Toto of Nepi. Toto, the papal governor and self-styled &quot;Duke&quot; of Nepi, began to position himself to take advantage of the expected death of Pope Paul I, and elevate his own candidate onto the papal throne. Christophorus, the primicerius of the notaries, forced Toto to take an oath to respect the traditional clerical method of papal elections. Toto, however, having retired to his estates in Nepi, with the help of Constantine and his other brothers collected troops from his duchy and other parts of Tuscany, in addition to arming a group of peasants to swell the numbers.

==Election==
On 28 June, hearing that Pope Paul was on the verge of dying, Toto and his armed men forced their way into the city through the Gate of St. Pancratius. With Paul’s death, Toto made his way to the Basilica of the Apostles where the other members of the papal court and Roman nobility were gathering, and there Christophorus had everyone swear that they would all uphold each other’s rights during the upcoming election. However, as soon as the meeting had broken up, Toto’s armed retainers had assembled in his house at Rome and elected his brother Constantine as pope.

Since Constantine was still a layperson, he needed to be ordained deacon and priest and then consecrated as bishop in rapid succession. Although frowned upon by canon law, this approach was far from unknown at the time. Therefore, accompanied by a group of armed men, he was escorted to the Lateran Palace, where they attempted to force George, the Bishop of Praeneste, to ordain Constantine as a monk. George threw himself at Constantine’s feet, begging Constantine not to make him do this. However, Constantine and his supporters made it clear that he would be forced to, one way or another. George therefore performed the ceremony, ordaining Constantine as a monk. The next day, 29 June, Bishop George made Constantine a subdeacon followed immediately by his elevation to deacon. This contravened canon law, which required an interval between the giving of the major orders of at least one day.

The Roman people were then required to take an oath of fidelity to Constantine, who again forced George of Praeneste, together with bishops Eustratius of Albano and Citonatus of Porto, to consecrate him as Bishop of Rome on 5 July 767. In the meantime, opposition to the antipope was being led by Christophorus, the Primicerius, and his son Sergius, the treasurer of the Roman church. Noting, however, that their lives were in danger, they fled for sanctuary to St. Peter’s Basilica, where they remained until April 768.

==Reign==
One of Constantine’s first acts was to give notice to the Frankish King, Pepin the Short of his election, to secure the king’s approval of his actions. Constantine’s letter to Pepin declared that, against his wishes, he had been raised to the Apostolic See by &quot;the people of Rome and the cities adjoining it&quot;, and that he hoped for the continuation of the friendship Pepin had shown to both his predecessors, Paul I and Stephen II. Pepin ignored this letter; Constantine wrote another, in which he declared that only the actions of the people had compelled him to take on the burdensome office. He begged Pepin to bestow his friendship, promising that he would be even more in his debt than his predecessors were, and to pay no attention to any slanderous accusations regarding him or his election. Pepin refused to reply to either letter.

On 12 August, Constantine received a letter, addressed to his predecessor Paul, from all the Eastern patriarchs apart from the Patriarch of Constantinople. It was a synodical letter of faith, sent by Theodore, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and endorsed by Theodore, Patriarch of Antioch, and Cosmas, Patriarch of Alexandria. It was also endorsed by a large number of the eastern Metropolitan bishops. In it, it described their support of the veneration of Icons, and their opposition to the iconoclasm being enforced by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V. Constantine had the letter read before the Roman people, after which he forwarded it to King Pepin.

Meanwhile, Christophorus and Sergius had hatched a plot with key supporters in the city. They begged Constantine to allow them to leave the city and become monks in the Monastery of Our Saviour, near Rieti in the Duchy of Spoleto. Swearing an oath to that effect, they were allowed to depart around 10 April 768. Instead of going to the monastery, however, father and son headed straight for Theodicius of Spoleto, who arranged an interview with Desiderius, King of the Lombards. Desiderius agreed to provide Christophorus and Sergius with troops from Spoleto, and that he would support their march on Rome to overthrow the antipope. With these troops and a Lombard priest named Waldipert, Sergius returned to the city, helped through the Gate of St. Pancratius on 30 July 768 by supporters within. His force took the walls, but were hesitant to descend the Janiculum Hill into the city.

As soon as word came through that the Lombards had entered the city, Toto came out to confront them with his own forces. During a battle in the streets of Rome, Toto was killed, and his brother Passivus rushed to warn Constantine to flee. The two brothers finally shut themselves within the oratory of St. Cesarius, managing to hide for a few hours before they were discovered and thrown into prison by Roman army officers.

==Deposition and mutilation==
Whilst Constantine was in prison, there was an attempt to install another antipope, Philip, followed by the election of Pope Stephen III. After his election, followers of the new pope began attacking key members of Constantine’s regime, including Bishop Theodore, the Vice-dominus and Constantine’s brother, Passivus, both of whom were blinded. Constantine was taken from prison, put on a horse and driven through the city on top of a woman’s saddle, with heavy weights attached to his feet, among jeering crowds. He was then imprisoned in the monastery of San Saba.

On 6 August, Constantine was taken to the Lateran Basilica, and canonically degraded. His pallium was thrown at his feet by a subdeacon, and his papal shoes were cut off his feet. There was still support for Constantine, however. The town of Alatri, under the leadership of its governor, Gracilis, who held the title of a Tribune, came out in support of the antipope. He pillaged the region around Campania, but the town was stormed by a force of Romans, Tuscans and armed troops from various parts of Campania, and Gracilis was captured. Concerned that Constantine was still a focus of dissent, the papal Chartularius, Gratiosus, and two other officials, gave permission for Constantine to be taken from the monastic prison early in the morning, blinded him, and left him lying in the street. They prohibited anyone from giving him aid; after 24 hours, however, complaints from the people prompted the monks to re-imprison him in the monastery.

In April 769, Pope Stephen III opened a new Lateran Council; a major topic for discussion was the elevation of Constantine. The blinded prisoner was brought before the council, where they questioned his elevation to the Apostolic See when he was still a layman. Constantine responded that he had been forced to take on the role, as the Roman people had been looking for someone to fix the problems left behind by Pope Paul I. He then confessed to the charges, and threw himself on the mercy of the synod. On the following day, however, he retracted his confession, arguing that his actions had not been any different to other papal elections in the past. He stated:
I have done nothing, my brethren, which cannot be excused by recent examples. Sergius, a layman like myself, has been consecrated metropolitan of Ravenna; the layman Stephen has even been ordained Bishop of Naples...

Infuriated by his arguments, the synod ordered Constantine beaten, had his tongue torn out, and excommunicated him from the Church. Constantine&#x27;s acts and rulings were then publicly burnt before the entire synod. He was returned to his monastery, and no further mention of him is known.

<text>Permission to Land is the debut studio album by the British glam rock band The Darkness, released on 7 July 2003 in the UK and 16 September 2003 in the US. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number thirty-six on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Five singles were released from &quot;Permission to Land&quot;: &quot;Get Your Hands off My Woman&quot;, &quot;Growing on Me&quot;, &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;, &quot;Christmas Time (Don&#x27;t Let the Bells End)&quot; (which only appears on the German Christmas edition), and &quot;Love Is Only a Feeling&quot;. &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot; was the most successful, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart.

==History==
The band was renowned for their live shows from very early on, and such was the popularity of the band, they had a Carling Homecoming gig booked for the London Astoria before they had even signed a record deal. Joe Taylor, Aled Jones and Paul Scaife at &quot;The Tip Sheet&quot;, a weekly magazine and CD insert for UK music industry insiders, first heard about the band through a post on The Tip Sheet message board, and featured &quot;Love Is Only a Feeling&quot; in January 2002. &quot;Record of the Day&quot; featured the song again around the time of SXSW in March 2003. &quot;Friday Night&quot; was to be featured next, but they were told the band was saving it for an album.

According to A&amp;R man Nick Raphael in an interview with HitQuarters, there was no initial clamour to sign the band: &quot;There couldn&#x27;t have been less of a buzz, and only two record labels showed any interest in them.&quot; He believes the reason for lack of interest was that &quot;The business as a whole thought they were uncool. In fact, people were saying that they were a joke and that they weren&#x27;t real.&quot; As part of Sony Music UK, Raphael had attempted to sign them but the band instead opted to go with Atlantic Records.

&quot;Permission to Land&quot; went straight up to number two on the UK Albums Chart upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell over 1.4 million copies in the UK alone.

In October 2023, a deluxe edition named &quot;Permission to Land… Again&quot; was released to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album. This edition includes B-sides, unreleased demos, and live tracks.

==Recording==
The band took inspiration for some of their work from the local north Suffolk area surrounding their home town, Lowestoft, including &quot;Black Shuck&quot;, based on the legend of a dog which supposedly haunts the church of the nearby village of Blythburgh. &quot;Stuck in a Rut&quot; also mentions a set of roads known as the &quot;Barnby Bends&quot;, and the &quot;Acle Straight&quot;, both of which are prominent routes between Lowestoft and Beccles and Norwich and Great Yarmouth respectively. The band recorded an interview for MTV Japan, which discusses the inspiration behind these songs, as well as featuring self-filmed footage of their home town. This features on a bonus DVD included with the Japanese deluxe edition of the album.

==Critical reception==

The album received widespread acclaim by critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album earned an average score of 79, based on 19 reviews.

&quot;&quot;Permission to Land&quot; will never be the album that The Darkness think it is,&quot; decided &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;but, taken in the spirit that it is offered, it&#x27;s certainly more fun than &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot;.&quot; In July 2019, Decibel Magazine inducted &quot;Permission to Land&quot; into their Hall of Fame, stating that the album &quot;that came to define hard rock in the early aughts sounds nothing like anything else that was released in 2003 – or the previous decade, for that matter&quot;.

==Awards and accolades==

The success of this album led to heavy touring for the band, including European portions of Metallica&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. They then went on to headline the Carling Festival in 2004. The band won three BRIT Awards in 2004 in response to the album, &quot;Best Group&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Group&quot; and &quot;Best Album&quot;. They also won two Kerrang! awards in 2004 for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; and &quot;Best British Band&quot;. The third single from the album, &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;, was a substantial hit in the UK as was their tilt at the Christmas 2003 number 1, &quot;Christmas Time (Don&#x27;t Let the Bells End)&quot;, which only just fell short, both singles reaching No.2 in 2003.

In addition to its chart success, &quot;Permission to Land&quot; also provided the Darkness with two high-profile music awards; Best Rock Album at the 2003 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards and Best British Album at the 2004 BRIT Awards (at which they also won the awards for Best British Group and Best British Rock Act). &quot;Permission to Land&quot; was voted 49th in the 50 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. &quot;Permission to Land&quot; was later referenced in the song &quot;Whichever Way You Wanna Give It&quot; by lead singer Justin Hawkins&#x27; other band Hot Leg.
In 2005, the album was ranked number 356 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2016, Metal Hammer ranked &quot;Permission to Land&quot; sixty-third in their list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century, calling it &#x27;one of the greatest debut albums of all time&#x27;.

<text>Ember days (quarter tense in Ireland) are quarterly periods of prayer and fasting in the liturgical calendar of Western Christian churches. The term is from , possibly derived from . These fasts traditionally take place on the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday of the weeks following St Lucy&#x27;s Day (13 December), the first Sunday in Lent, Pentecost (Whitsun), and Holy Cross Day (14 September), though some areas follow a different pattern. Ordination ceremonies are often held on Ember Saturdays or the following Sunday.

The observance of fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church eliminated the Ember days in 1966. They remain a feature of other Western churches, such as in Anglicanism, where the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; provides for the Ember days, in practice observed in different ways.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ember&quot; may originate from the Latin (literally &#x27;four times&#x27;).

There are various views as to etymology. According to John Mason Neale in &quot;Essays of Liturgiology&quot; (1863), Chapter X:
Neil and Willoughby in &quot;The Tutorial Prayer Book&quot; (1913) prefer the view that it derives from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;ymbren&quot;, a circuit or revolution (from &quot;ymb&quot;, around, and &quot;ryne&quot;, a course, running), clearly relating to the annual cycle of the year. The word occurs in such Anglo-Saxon compounds as &quot;ymbren-tid&quot; (&quot;Embertide&quot;), &quot;ymbren-wucan&quot; (&quot;Ember weeks&quot;), &quot;ymbren-fisstan&quot; (&quot;Ember fasts&quot;), &quot;ymbren-dagas&quot; (&quot;Ember days&quot;). The word &quot;imbren&quot; occurs in the acts of the &quot;Council of Ænham&quot; (1009): &quot;jejunia quatuor tempora quae imbren vocant&quot;, &quot;the fasts of the four seasons which are called &quot;imbren&#x27;&quot;.

==Origins==
The term &quot;Ember days&quot; refers to three days set apart for fasting, abstinence, and prayer during each of the four seasons of the year. The purpose of their introduction was to thank God for the gifts of nature, to teach men to make use of them in moderation, and to assist the needy.

Possibly originating in the agricultural feasts of ancient Rome, they came to be observed by Christians for the sanctification of the different seasons of the year. James G. Sabak argues that the Embertide vigils were &quot;...not based on imitating agrarian models of pre-Christian Roman practices, but rather on an eschatological rendering of the year punctuated by the solstices and equinoxes, and thus underscores the eschatological significance of all liturgical vigils in the city of Rome.&quot;

At first, the Church in Rome had fasts in June, September, and December. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; ascribes to Pope Callixtus I (217–222) a law regulating the fast, although Leo the Great (440–461) considers it an Apostolic institution. When the fourth season was added cannot be ascertained, but Pope Gelasius I (492–496) speaks of all four. The earliest mention of four seasonal fasts is known from the writings of Philastrius, bishop of Brescia (died ca 387) (&quot;De haeres.&quot; 119). He also connects them with the great Christian festivals.

As the Ember Days came to be associated with great feast days, they later lost their connection to agriculture and came to be regarded solely as days of penitence and prayer. It is only the Michaelmas Embertide, which falls around the autumn harvest, that retains any connection to the original purpose.

The Christian observance of the seasonal Ember days had its origin as an ecclesiastical ordinance in Rome and spread from there to the rest of the Western Church. They were known as the &quot;jejunium vernum, aestivum, autumnale and hiernale&quot;, so that to quote Pope Leo&#x27;s words (A.D. 440–461) the law of abstinence might apply to every season of the year. In Leo&#x27;s time, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday were already days of special observance. In order to tie them to the fasts preparatory to the three great festivals of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, a fourth needed to be added &quot;for the sake of symmetry&quot; as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 1911 has it.

From Rome the Ember days gradually spread unevenly through the whole of Western Christendom. In Gaul they do not seem to have been generally recognized much before the 8th century.

Their observance in Britain, however, was embraced earlier than in Gaul or Spain, and Christian sources connect the Ember Days observance with Augustine of Canterbury, AD. 597, said to be acting under the direct authority of Pope Gregory the Great. The precise dates appears to have varied considerably however, and in some cases, quite significantly, the Ember Weeks lost their connection with the Christian festivals altogether. Spain adopted them with the Roman rite in the eleventh century. Charles Borromeo introduced them into Milan in the sixteenth century.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, ember days have never been observed.

== Ember Weeks ==
The Ember Weeks, the weeks in which the Ember Days occur, are these weeks:
*December:
** between the third and fourth Sundays of Advent (usually W51)
** the Common Worship lectionary of the Church of England places them in the week following the &quot;second&quot; Sunday in Advent (W50)
** because the calendar reform in the 1970s includes specific &quot;Late Advent&quot; propers for Dec 17 onward, when Divine Worship: The Missal was issued with a particular calendar for the Personal Ordinariates, the Vatican assigned the Ember Days to the &quot;first&quot; week of Advent (W49).
*March: between the first and second Sundays in Lent (W07–W11)
*June: between Pentecost and Trinity Sunday (W20–W24)
*September: the liturgical Third Week of September.
** According to an old way of counting, the first Sunday of a month (a datum important to determine the appropriate Matins readings) was considered the Sunday &quot;proximate to&quot;, not &quot;on or after&quot;, the first of the month, so this yielded as Ember Week precisely the week containing the Wednesday after Holy Cross Day (September 14), and as Ember Days said Wednesday and the following Friday and Saturday (W38). It has been preserved in that order by Western Rite Orthodoxy, the Catholic Personal Ordinariates, and Anglicans.
** For Roman Catholics, a 20th-century reform of the Breviary shifted the First Sunday in September to what the name literally implies, and by implication, Ember Week to the Week beginning with the Sunday after Holy Cross day. Therefore, in a year that September 14 falls on a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the Ember Days for Western Rite Orthodox and Anglicans are a week sooner than for those of most modern-day Catholics. When the Vatican issued the calendar specific to the Personal Ordinariates in Divine Worship: The Missal, it assigned the Ember Days to the traditional, earlier dates.

==Timing==
The &quot;Ordo Romanus&quot; fixed the spring fast in the first week of March (then the first month), thus loosely associated with the first Sunday in Lent; the summer fast in the second week of June, after Whitsunday; the autumnal fast in the third week of September following the Exaltation of the Cross, September 14; and the winter fast in the complete week next before Christmas Eve, following St. Lucy&#x27;s Day (Dec. 13).

These dates are given in the following Latin mnemonic:
Or in an old English rhyme:

&quot;Lenty, Penty, Crucy, Lucy&quot; is a shorter mnemonic for when they fall.

The ember days began on the Wednesday immediately following those days. This meant, for instance, that if September 14 were a Tuesday, the ember days would occur on September 15, 17, and 18. As a result, the ember days in September could fall after either the second or third Sunday in September. This was always the liturgical Third Week of September, since the First Sunday of September was the Sunday closest to September 1 (August 29 to September 4). 

As a simplification of the liturgical calendar, Pope John XXIII modified this so that the Third Sunday was the third Sunday actually within the calendar month. Thus if September 14 were a Sunday, September 24, 26 and 27 would be ember days, the latest dates possible. With September 14 as a Saturday, the ember days would occur on September 18, 20 and 21, the earliest possible dates.

Other regulations prevailed in different countries, until the inconveniences arising from the want of uniformity led to the rule now observed being laid down under Pope Urban II as the law of the church, at the Council of Piacenza and the Council of Clermont, 1095.

Prior to the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church mandated fasting and abstinence on all Ember Days, and the faithful were encouraged (though not required) to receive the sacrament of penance whenever possible. On February 17, 1966, Pope Paul VI&#x27;s decree Paenitemini excluded the Ember Days as days of fast and abstinence for Roman Catholics.

The revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 laid down the following rules for Ember Days and Rogation days:

They may appear in some calendars as &quot;days of prayer for peace&quot;.

They were made optional by churches of the Anglican Communion in 1976. In the Episcopal Church, the September Ember Days are still (optionally) observed on the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after Holy Cross Day, so that if September 14 is a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the Ember Days fall on the following Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (in the second week of September) whereas they fall a week later (in the third week of September) for the Roman Catholic Church (except in the Ordinariates for former Anglicans, which also follow the traditional dating for Ember Days).

Some Lutheran church calendars continue the observation of Ember and Rogation days, though the practice has diminished over the past century.

==Ireland==
Quarter tense is normally determined by national Roman Catholic hierarchies and not by the universal calendar of the church. The Saturdays of Quarter Tense were considered especially appropriate for priestly ordination. The days of Quarter Tense were, until the Second Vatican Council, times of obligatory fasting and abstinence. However, in Ireland, the obligation of abstinence (the complete avoidance of meat) on the Saturdays of Quarter Tense outside Lent was removed by the Vatican in 1912.

*The term &quot;quarter tense&quot; is derived from the official Latin name; &quot;quattuor tempora&quot; (&quot;the four times&quot;).
*In the Irish language, Quarter Tense is Cátaoir, Cátaoir na timpire, Aimsir Chátaoireach, or Laethanta na gCeithre Thráth (lit. &quot;the days of the four times&quot;).

The old dates in the Irish calendar for the observation of Quarter Tense were:

*The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday following Ash Wednesday, (liturgical colour - Purple).
*The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Pentecost Sunday, (liturgical colour - Red).
*The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after September 14- the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, (liturgical colour - Purple).
*The Wednesday, Friday and Saturday following December 13- Feast of Saint Lucy, (liturgical colour - Purple).

==Ordination of clergy==
The rule that ordination of clergy should take place in the Ember weeks was set in documents traditionally associated with Pope Gelasius I (492–496), the pontificate of Archbishop Ecgbert of York, A.D. 732–766, and referred to as a canonical rule in a capitulary of Charlemagne. It was finally established as a law of the church in the pontificate of Pope Gregory VII, &quot;ca&quot; 1085.

However, why Ember Saturdays are traditionally associated with ordinations (other than episcopal ones) is unclear. By the time of at the penultimate Code of Canon Law (1917), major orders could also be conferred on the Saturday preceding Passion Sunday, and on the Easter Vigil; for grave reasons, on Sundays and holy days of obligation; and, for minor orders, even without grave reason, on all Sundays and double feasts, which included most saints&#x27; feasts and thus the great majority of the calendar. 

Present Roman Catholic canon law (1983) prefers them to be conferred on Sundays and holy days of obligation, but allows them for pastoral reason on any day. In practice the use of Saturdays, though not necessarily Ember Saturdays, still prevails. Subsequently, Pentecost Vigil and the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul (and Saturdays around it) have come much in use as ordination days.

==Weather prediction==
According to folklore, the weather conditions of each of the three days of an Embertide foretell the weather conditions for the following three months.

In the folk meteorology of the North of Spain, the weather of the ember days (&quot;témporas&quot;) is considered to predict the weather of the rest of the year. The prediction methods differ in the regions. Two frequent ones are:
* Wind-based: The season after the ember days will have as a prevailing wind the prevailing one during the ember days (some just consider the wind at midnight). That wind usually has an associated weather. Hence, if the southern wind brings dry air and clear skies, a southern wind during the winter embers forecasts a dry winter.
* Considering each day separately: The Wednesday weather predicts the weather for the first month; the Friday weather for the second month and the Saturday weather for the third month.

<text>Ripley Under Water is a 1991 psychological thriller by Patricia Highsmith, the last of five novels featuring Tom Ripley, &quot;an intelligent, cultured gentleman who dabbles in art, music and, occasionally, murder&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Tom Ripley spends his days tending his garden and playing the harpsichord at his home near Fontainebleau. He worries about the appearance of an American couple in his village. The husband eventually introduces himself as David Pritchard and invites Ripley to his rented house. Pritchards and his wife Janice are attracted to the artificial pond in front of the house. Janice strikes Ripley as a victim of abuse, and the couple argue openly during his visit. 

Ripley soon receives a taunting call from &quot;Dickie Greenleaf,&quot; the first person he murdered. When Ripley and his wife Heloïse travel to Tangier, Pritchard follows them. Ripley lures Pritchard to an isolated café, where Pritchard reveals his intention to torment Ripley. He also hints that Ripley&#x27;s victims are helping with the effort. In a rage, Ripley beats Pritchard but stops short of killing him. 

Ripley dwells on his past murders, such as that of Thomas Murchison as the result of an art forgery scheme. Pritchard is in touch with Murchison&#x27;s widow and suspects Ripley murdered her husband. He starts dredging local canals and rivers in search of Murchison&#x27;s corpse. When he finds it, he leaves the headless remains on Ripley&#x27;s doorstep. Ripley takes a ring off the corpse that could identify it as Murchison&#x27;s. He returns the corpse to the pond in front of the Pritchards&#x27; house. When they investigate the splash, both fall in and are unable to escape before drowning.

The police are perplexed by the bones and the double drowning. They interview Ripley because Pritchard told Mrs. Murchison he found her husband&#x27;s body and would deliver it to Ripley. Ripley feigns confusion over why Pritchard would do such a thing. He charms the police into sharing a drink with him before leaving. The next day, Ripley throws Murchison&#x27;s ring into a nearby river.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; review concluded, &quot;This is the least good of the Ripley books, one in which the distinctly undramatic climax suggests that Patricia Highsmith is no longer much involved with her criminal creation...But the title is an ingenious joke, for in the end it is not Ripley who is ever under water.&quot; James Campbell noted that the novel &quot;takes about 100 pages to get going, and when it does, the pace, paradoxically, seems to slacken.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
===Radio===
The 2009 BBC Radio 4 adaptation stars Ian Hart as Ripley, Helen Longworth as Heloise, William Hope as David Pritchard, Janice Acquah as Janice Pritchard and Caroline Guthrie as Madame Annette.

<text>The Reddings were an American funk, soul and disco band, founded by Otis Redding&#x27;s sons Dexter (bass and vocals) and Otis Redding III (December 17, 1963 – April 18, 2023 age 59; guitar) together with Mark Lockett (drums, keyboards, and lead vocal).

Their most well-known songs include &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1980) / &quot;Doin&#x27; it&quot; / &quot;Funkin on the One&quot; / &quot;Class (Is What You Got)&quot; (1981) / &quot;Sittin&#x27; on the Dock of the Bay&quot; (1982) / &quot;Hand Dance&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Awakening&quot; (1980), a bass-drums-duet which is often performed live by Les Claypool (Primus) and on his album &quot;Highball with the Devil&quot;.

Their album &quot;The Reddings&quot; was released on November 26, 1988, and reached a peak position of #88 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. It featured a hit single &quot;Call The Law,&quot; which reached peak position of #16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles Chart on November 26, 1988.

In December 1980, &quot;Remote Control,&quot; from the first album by the Reddings (&quot;The Awakening&quot;), went to #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles chart, and peaked at #89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The tune was sampled in an episode of the 1980s television programme, &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. Written by Nick Mann, Bill Beard, and Chet Fortune of the Washington, D.C.–based songwriting team of Last Colony Music, &quot;Remote Control&quot; continues to receive airplay in countries including Belgium, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1979 to 1980, Dexter, Otis III, and Mark had recorded &quot;The Awakening&quot; with producers Russell Timmons and Nick Mann at the Believe in a Dream studio, which was located in downtown Washington, D.C.

On April 18, 2023, Otis Redding III died of cancer at the age of 59.

<doc id="541721" wikidata="Q2625100" url="?curid=541721" title="Tom Ripley">
<text>Tom Ripley is a fictional character in the &quot;Ripley&quot; series of crime novels by American novelist Patricia Highsmith, as well as several film adaptations. He is a psychopathic career criminal, con artist, and serial killer. The five novels in which he appears—&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;, &quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot;, and &quot;Ripley Under Water&quot;—were published between 1955 and 1991.

Ripley has been critically acclaimed for being &quot;both a likable character and a cold-blooded killer&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;It is near impossible, I would say, not to root for Tom Ripley. Not to like him. Not, on some level, to want him to win. Patricia Highsmith does a fine job of ensuring he wheedles his way into our sympathies.&quot; &quot;Book&quot; magazine ranked Ripley on its list of the 100 Best Characters in Fiction since 1900.

==Fictional biography==
===Backstory===
Highsmith introduced Ripley in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1955), in which she provided him with a backstory. He was orphaned at age five when his parents drowned in Boston Harbor, and then raised by his aunt Dottie, a cold, stingy woman who mocked him as a &quot;sissy.” As a teenager, he attempted unsuccessfully to run away from his aunt&#x27;s home to New York City before finally moving there at age 20 to pursue an unsuccessful career as an actor. Ripley subsequently made a meager living as a con artist utilizing his skills in &quot;forging signatures, telling lies, and impersonating practically anybody.”

===Ripliad===
====&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;====
Ripley is paid to go to Italy by shipbuilding magnate Herbert Greenleaf to convince his son Dickie, a half-remembered acquaintance, to return to New York and take over the family business. Ripley befriends the younger Greenleaf and falls in love with the rich young man&#x27;s indulgent, carefree lifestyle; he also becomes obsessed with Dickie himself. When Dickie grows bored with Ripley and spurns his friendship, Ripley kills him and assumes his identity, living off his trust fund.

====&quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;====
In &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;, set six years later, Ripley has settled down into a life of leisure in France. He lives in a small country house called Belle Ombre (&quot;Beautiful Shadow&quot;) in Villeperce, a fictional small town near Fontainebleau, about an hour’s drive from Paris. He has added to his fortunes by marrying Héloïse Plisson, an heiress who has suspicions about how he makes his money but prefers not to know. He occasionally assists small-time gangster Reeves Minot with lucrative forgery and smuggling jobs, but he avoids direct involvement in crime as much as possible to preserve his shady reputation. Ripley is also a silent partner in a gallery that markets counterfeit works by the artist Derwatt, who has actually been dead for years.

====&quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;====
In &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;, Ripley turns down Minot&#x27;s offer to kill two rival gangsters in two separate hits. Soon afterward, he is insulted at a party by Jonathan Trevanny, a poor picture framer who has leukaemia. To get back at him, Ripley tells Minot that Jonathan is an assassin who can kill his two rivals. Minot then approaches Jonathan offering to hire him as a freelance assassin, an offer he reluctantly accepts in order to support his family after his death.

====&quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot;====
In &quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot;, Ripley befriends Frank Pierson, a teenage boy from a wealthy family who has run away from home. After Frank confesses to Ripley that he killed his own father by pushing him off a cliff, Ripley lets the boy live with him and Heloise at Belle Ombre, seeing in him a kindred spirit. However, Frank is kidnapped by German gangsters who hold him for ransom.

====&quot;Ripley Under Water&quot;====
In &quot;Ripley Under Water&quot;, Ripley&#x27;s new neighbors, David and Janice Pritchard, hear of his suspicious reputation and begin prying into his private life, simply because they dislike him. When they discover that he murdered Murchison and threaten to expose him, Ripley pursues them with the aid of Ed Bradbury, one of his business partners in the Derwatt forgery scam.

==Characterization==
===Personality===
Highsmith characterizes Ripley as a &quot;suave, agreeable and utterly amoral&quot; con artist and serial killer who always evades justice. Ripley is epicurean and sophisticated, living a life of leisure in rural France. He spends most of his time gardening, painting, or studying languages. This is financed by a stolen inheritance, a small income from the Buckmaster Gallery, and his wife&#x27;s allowance from her wealthy father. He is polite, friendly, and cultured, and dislikes people who lack such qualities; when the Pritchards appear in &quot;Ripley Under Water&quot;, their poor taste and manners immediately offend him. Ripley has typically been regarded as &quot;cultivated&quot;, a &quot;dapper sociopath&quot;, and an &quot;agreeable and urbane psychopath.&quot;

In his review of &quot;Purple Noon&quot;, René Clément&#x27;s 1960 adaptation of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert described Ripley as &quot;a committed hedonist, devoted to great comfort, understated taste, and civilized interests. He has wonderful relationships with women, who never fully understand who or what he is. He has friendships – real ones – with many of his victims. His crimes are like moves in a chess game; he understands that as much as he may like and respect his opponents, he must end with a &#x27;checkmate&#x27;.&quot;

===Sexuality===
While Highsmith never explicitly portrays Ripley as gay or bisexual, certain passages in the Ripley novels imply that he harbors some unacknowledged attraction towards men. In &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, he is obsessed with Greenleaf and is jealous of his girlfriend to the point that he fantasizes about Greenleaf rejecting and hitting her. Afraid that others will think he is gay, he jokes that he wants to give up both men and women because he cannot decide which he likes more. In &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;, he recalls &quot;turning green&quot; during his wedding, then going impotent with laughter while having sex with Heloise during their honeymoon. 

In &quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot;, he reflects that he and Heloise rarely have sex and that frequent sexual demands on her part &quot;really would have turned him off, maybe at once and permanently.” &quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot;, meanwhile, has been cited as portraying a homoerotic subtext between Ripley and the novel&#x27;s supporting protagonist, Frank Pierson. For example, Frank sleeps in Ripley&#x27;s bed without changing the sheets and speaks of his happiness at being at Belle Ombre with &quot;the words of a lover.” Highsmith herself was ambivalent about the subject of Ripley&#x27;s sexuality. &quot;I don&#x27;t think Ripley is gay,” she said in a 1988 interview with &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;. &quot;He appreciates good looks in other men, that&#x27;s true. But he&#x27;s married in later books. I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s very strong in the sex department. But he makes it in bed with his wife.&quot;

===Psychopathy===
Ripley is portrayed as devoid of conscience. In &quot;The Boy Who Followed Ripley&quot;, he admits that he has never been seriously troubled by guilt. Though he sometimes feels &quot;regret&quot; about his earliest murders – he considers the murder of Dickie Greenleaf &quot;a youthful, dreadful mistake&quot; and that of Freddie Miles &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;unnecessary&quot; – he cannot remember the number of his victims. In his 2001 book &quot;Malignant Self-Love: Narcissism Revisited&quot;, Sam Vaknin writes that Ripley (as portrayed in the 1999 film &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;) meets five of the seven criteria for antisocial personality disorder and also displays narcissistic traits. 

Ripley is not without redeeming qualities, however. He feels genuine affection (if not love) for several characters throughout the series and has his own code of ethics. In &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;, Ripley reflects that he detests murder unless it is &quot;absolutely necessary.” In his review of &quot;Purple Noon&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Ripley is a criminal of intelligence and cunning who gets away with murder. He&#x27;s charming and literate, and a monster. It&#x27;s insidious, the way Highsmith seduces us into identifying with him and sharing his selfishness; Ripley believes that getting his own way is worth whatever price anyone else might have to pay. We all have a little of that in us.&quot;

==Adaptations==

Highsmith&#x27;s first three Ripley novels have been adapted into films. &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; was filmed as &quot;Purple Noon&quot; (French: &quot;Plein Soleil&quot;) in 1960, starring Alain Delon as Ripley, and under its original title in 1999, starring Matt Damon. &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; was adapted into a 2005 film, starring Barry Pepper. &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; was filmed in 1977 as &quot;The American Friend&quot;, starring Dennis Hopper, and under its original title in 2002, starring John Malkovich.

The Ripley novels have also been adapted for television and radio. &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; was adapted for a January 1956 episode of the anthology television series &quot;Studio One&quot;, and Jonathan Kent played Ripley in a 1982 episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; titled &quot;Patricia Highsmith: A Gift for Murder&quot;, dramatizing segments of &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;. In 2009, BBC Radio 4 adapted all five Ripley novels with Ian Hart as Ripley. 

In 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that a group of production companies were planning a television series based on the novels. The following year, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that the series would be written by Neil Cross, having been in development at Endemol Shine Studios for over a year. In 2019, the show was ordered to series at Showtime, with actor Andrew Scott playing the lead role and writer-director Steven Zaillian replacing Cross. In 2023, the series had moved to Netflix. The series premiered in April 2024, with Scott receiving critical praise and a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for his performance as Ripley.

Of the Ripley portrayals that Highsmith saw, she praised Delon&#x27;s performance in &quot;Purple Noon&quot; as &quot;excellent&quot; and described Jonathan Kent as &quot;perfect&quot;. She initially disliked Hopper&#x27;s Ripley in &quot;The American Friend&quot;, but changed her mind after seeing the film a second time, feeling that he had captured the essence of the character. In Joanna Murray Smith&#x27;s 2014 play, &quot;Switzerland&quot;, Tom Ripley comes to life and visits Highsmith, planning to kill her. In the 2014 Sydney Theatre Company premiere production, he was portrayed by Eamon Farren.

In Kim Newman&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula Cha Cha Cha&quot; (also published as &quot;Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959&quot;) (1998), Tom Ripley is a supporting character working at the Italian estate of Count Dracula, while plotting to steal vast amounts of wealth from his vampire employer.

<doc id="541724" wikidata="Q76906" url="?curid=541724" title="Dieter Bohlen">
<text>Dieter Bohlen (; born Dieter Günter Bohlen, 7 February 1954) is a German songwriter, producer, singer and television personality. He first achieved fame as a member of the pop duo Modern Talking in the 1980s, and has since produced numerous German and international artists. He is also a judge on casting shows &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; and &quot;Das Supertalent&quot;.

== Life and career ==
=== 1954–1984: Early life and career beginnings ===

Bohlen is the eldest son of building contractor Hans Bohlen (born 1928) and his wife Edith (born 1936), and grew up in East Frisia. His maternal grandmother is originally from Königsberg. He was named Dieter Günter Bohlen but later expressed dissatisfaction with his second given name and had it officially struck. He has a younger brother named Uwe. The family later moved to Eversten (Oldenburg). In his youth, Bohlen was a member of the Socialist German Workers Youth for a while and shortly of the German Communist Party, though he is not a member of any party nowadays. After getting his Abitur at the Wirtschaftsgymnasium der Berufsbildenden Schulen in Oldenburg-Haarentor, he moved to Göttingen. There, he studied business administration at his parents&#x27; request at the Georg-August-Universität, finishing his studies in 1978 with a degree.

Bohlen was still in school when he started writing music. In the late 1970s, he worked as a songwriter at the Hamburg-based label Intersong for numerous Schlager singers. In 1978, he founded the short-lived duo Monza with Holger Garbode. Their first single, &quot;Hallo Taxi Nummer 10&quot;, written and produced by Tony Hendrik, was Bohlen&#x27;s first record and was unsuccessful. Monza released a second single, &quot;Heiße Nacht in der City&quot;, a German-language cover of Nick Gilder&#x27;s &quot;Hot Night in the City&quot;, which also was unsuccessful. In 1980, he began working for the Berlin-based label Hansa. That same year, under the pseudonym Steve Benson, he released a solo single in English, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw My Love Away&quot;. It was followed in 1981 by two other singles under that name, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; and &quot;(You&#x27;re A Devil With) Angel Blue Eyes&quot;. None of them reached the top 100, which led to the abandonment of the project in 1981. Soon after, he joined the band Sunday, with which he appeared on the &quot;ZDF-Hitparade&quot; in early 1982 with the song &quot;Halé, hey Louise&quot;. The song was covered by artists such as Ricky King. In 1983, in collaboration with Manfred Setzer, Bohlen wrote the song &quot;Mit 17&quot; for Bernd Clüver, which reached the third place of the German pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest.

=== 1984–present: Successes as a producer ===
After Bohlen produced six unsuccessful singles in German for Schlager singer Thomas Anders from 1982 to 1984, they founded the pop duo Modern Talking. The band topped the German singles chart five times in a row with &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;, &quot;You Can Win If You Want&quot;, &quot;Cheri, Cheri Lady&quot;, &quot;Brother Louie&quot;, and &quot;Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. For Love)&quot;, and were also successful in other European countries as well as in Asia and Africa. In 1987, the band split up and Bohlen founded his solo project Blue System, which he ended ten years later. He also continued writing and producing for other artists, including C. C. Catch (whom he discovered), Sheree (whom he signed when she was fifteen years old), and boy band Touché.

In 1986, Bohlen wrote the title song &quot;Midnight Lady&quot; of &quot;Tatort&quot; episode &#x27;, which was performed by former Smokie singer Chris Norman and was major hit in Central Europe, topping several charts. The song appeared on Norman&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Some Hearts Are Diamonds&quot;, which was produced by Bohlen. In 1988, he wrote the title song of &quot;Tatort&quot; episode &#x27;, &quot;Silent Water&quot;, which he performed himself as Blue System. In 1989, two songs written and produced by him were sent to the Eurovision Song Contest: Nino de Angelo represented Germany with the song &quot;Flieger&quot; and reached place 14, while Thomas Forstner represented Austria with the song &quot;Nur ein Lied&quot; and reached place 5. Also in 1989, Bohlen wrote the soundtrack to the ZDF series &quot;Rivalen der Rennbahn&quot;, which was certified platinum in Germany that same year and reached the top 5 in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

In 1991, Bohlen produced Roy Black&#x27;s final album &quot;Rosenzeit&quot;. From 1991 to 1993, he worked with Bonnie Tyler on the albums &quot;Bitterblue&quot;, &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, and &quot;Silhouette in Red&quot;. The collaboration spawned a number of successful singles, such as &quot;Bitterblue&quot;, &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (which was used as the title song of &quot;Tatort&quot; episode &quot;&quot;), and &quot;Fools Lullaby&quot;. In 1992, another Bohlen composition represented Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest. Titled &quot;Zusammen geh&#x27;n&quot;, it was performed by Tony Wegas and reached place 10. In 1998, Modern Talking made a successful comeback, releasing singles such as &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul &#x27;98, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, or Formula One songs &quot;Win the Race&quot; and &quot;Ready for the Victory&quot;, but split up again in 2003.

In 2002, &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; (often shortened as &quot;DSDS&quot;), the German version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot;, was launched with Bohlen as one of the judges. While the other judges are changed regularly, he has been a judge each season. He has produced most of the winners, yielding several hits such as &quot;We Have a Dream&quot;. That same year, he published his first book, an autobiography titled &quot;Nichts als die Wahrheit&quot;, written in collaboration with &quot;Bild&quot; journalist Katja Kessler, which sold over a million copies in Germany and got a Goldene Feder. A second autobiography written with Kessler, &quot;Hinter den Kulissen&quot;, was published the next year. It was criticised for its unfairness and charges were pressed by his former bandmate Thomas Anders. Frank Farian published the book &quot;Stupid Dieser Bohlen: Die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit über den Pop-Hochstapler&quot; as a response, in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud. Both &quot;Nichts als die Wahrheit&quot; and &quot;Hinter den Kulissen&quot; were also released as audiobooks read by Bohlen. In 2004, he won the ECHO for Producer of the Year, while &quot;We Have a Dream&quot; earned the ECHO for Rock/Pop Single of the Year (National).
In March 2006, &quot;&quot;, a satirical cartoon film based on &quot;Nichts als die Wahrheit&quot;, premiered. Bohlen did not voice his own role, but voiced the narrator. He wrote and produced the entirety of , which includes the previously unreleased Modern Talking song &quot;Shooting Star&quot;. Later that year, he produced the song &quot;Be My Boyfriend&quot; for the duo Indiggo, which reached the seventh place of the Romanian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. Also in 2006, he published his third book, &quot;Meine Hammer-Sprüche&quot;.

In 2007, the German installment of the &quot;Got Talent&quot; franchise, &quot;Das Supertalent&quot;, was launched with Bohlen as one of the judges. Similarly to &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the fellow judges are changed regularly but he has been a judge each season. In 2008, he published two more books, &quot;Nur die Harten kommen in den Garten! Der Weg zum Superstar&quot; and &quot;Der Bohlenweg: Planieren statt Sanieren&quot;.

In 2010, Bohlen began working with Schlager singer Andrea Berg. All of her albums produced by him (&quot;Schwerelos&quot;, &quot;Abenteuer&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Seelenbeben&quot;) topped the German and Austrian album charts. He ended their collaboration per email on 17 March 2018. On 3 April 2019, Bohlen and Berg announced they would publish two new songs together.

== Artistry ==
Bohlen&#x27;s productions are characterised by simply structured compositions. In the 1980s and 1990s, often working in the studio with Spanish producer Luis Rodríguez, he produced Euro disco and Eurodance songs for Modern Talking, Blue System, and C. C. Catch with falsetto choruses. Those choruses were achieved with the help of session singers, such as Rolf Köhler, Michael Scholz, and Detlef Wiedeke. With &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; winners, Bohlen tends to focus on pop ballads.

Copyright expert Paul Hertin from Berlin repeatedly claimed that Bohlen plagiarized several songs and thus breached copyright. For example, Hertin says that Bohlen used the melody of Babyface&#x27;s &quot;What If&quot; for the production of Yvonne Catterfeld&#x27;s &quot;Für dich&quot;. Based on Hertin&#x27;s expert assessment regarding the plagiarism allegations, the Berlin prosecutor&#x27;s office initiated a preliminary investigation against Bohlen, which was dropped.

== Other ventures ==
=== Casting shows ===

Bohlen has been on &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the German version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot;, since the show was launched in 2002. He often makes blunt and controversial comments, including insults and wisecracks about contestants and their singing abilities (such as &quot;You sing like a garden gnome on ecstasy&quot; or &quot;Your voice sounds like Kermit getting his arse kicked&quot;), which led to comparisons with Simon Cowell in the German-speaking press. He earns 1.2 million euros per season. He has worked with most of the winners and occasionally with other candidates, such as first season third-placer Daniel Küblböck, yielding several major hits. Since the show was launched in 2007, Bohlen has also been a judge on &quot;Das Supertalent&quot;, the German installment of the &quot;Got Talent&quot; franchise, being the only judge to have been on every season.

=== Products and endorsements ===
Bohlen has signed numerous advertising deals with companies such as Müller Milch, Makro Markt, S.Oliver, O₂, Roller (Möbelhaus), Wiesenhof, the Deutsche Bahn, and Unilever. He has been a longtime advertising partner of Camp David. In 2020, he had been the face of Camp David for 10 years.

Between 2002 and 2008, Bohlen published five books, ranging from autobiographies to advice books. In 2005, he released a perfume named &quot;Provocation&quot;. In 2011, he founded the clothing label &quot;Needs Clothing&quot; along with Felix Werner. In 2013, he released a line of wallpapers through P+S.

== Personal life ==

From 1983 to 1989, Bohlen was married to Erika Sauerland, whom he had met in 1974 in Göttingen. They have three children: Marc, Marvin, and Marielin. From 1989 to 1996, he was in a relationship with television personality and singer Nadja Abd el Farrag, also known under the stage name Naddel. On 13 May 1996, Bohlen married model Verona Feldbusch in Las Vegas, but they separated after four weeks. The divorce was finalised on 27 May 1997. From 1997 to 2001, he was in a relationship with Abd el Farrag again.

From 2001 to 2006, Bohlen lived with model and dancer Estefania Küster. Their son Maurice Cassian was born on 7 July 2005. Since 2006, he has been in a relationship with Fatma Carina Walz, who he met in Mallorca, Spain, where one of the casting events for &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; was held. They have a daughter named Amelie (born 22 March 2011) and a son named Maximilian (born 7 September 2013).

Bohlen lives in the village of Tötensen near Hamburg. He is left-handed, but was forced to learn how to write with his right hand at grammar school. He plays tennis with his left hand because he started tennis after leaving school. According to an article by the &quot;Manager Magazine&quot; in 2018, Bohlen has a net worth of €250 million, making him one of the thousand richest Germans.

<text>Bernd Weidung (born 1 March 1963), known by his stage name Thomas Anders, is a German singer, songwriter and record producer. He is best known as the vocalist of the pop duo Modern Talking.

Starting his singing career while still in school, Anders unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as a Schlager artist for several years. After forming the Eurodisco duo Modern Talking with Dieter Bohlen in 1983, they became a worldwide sensation with their hit &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;. They followed up with a string of other hits, namely &quot;You Can Win If You Want&quot;, &quot;Cheri, Cheri Lady&quot;, &quot;Brother Louie&quot;, &quot;Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)&quot;, &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot;, and &quot;Jet Airliner&quot;, before dissolving in 1987. In 1998, they reunited and produced several new songs such as &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, &quot;Sexy, Sexy Lover&quot;, &quot;No Face, No Name, No Number&quot;, &quot;Ready for the Victory&quot;, and &quot;TV Makes the Superstar&quot;, before dissolving again in 2003. Their controversial break-ups led to several lawsuits and heavy coverage from the German tabloid press. During their two stints together, the duo sold 120 million records worldwide and received numerous sales certifications around the globe.

After the two break-ups of Modern Talking, Anders performed as a solo artist during the 1990s and after 2003. During the first Modern Talking split, he released six studio albums, none of which managed to chart, whereas some singles such as &quot;Love of My Own&quot; achieved mediocre success. Only his Spanish language album &quot;Barcos de Cristal&quot; (1994) proved successful in Argentina, where its eponymous title track climbed to number 1. Following the second break-up, Anders started a more successful solo career, with his album &quot;This Time&quot; (2004) reaching number 14 in Germany and producing number 1 hits in Russia and Turkey. His 2010 album &quot;Strong&quot; reached Platinum status in Russia for sales of more than 650,000 copies. &quot;Two&quot; (2010), a collaboration album with Jörn-Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen reached number 11 in Germany, while his first German language album &quot;Pures Leben&quot; (2017) climbed at number 14.

While being unable to match his success with Modern Talking with his solo career, Anders is considered a musical icon in Eastern Europe, where he is more revered than in his native country and regularly performs stadium tours and on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Poland. In 2006, the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv made him an honorary professor for &quot;shaping the musical taste of a generation&quot;, and he holds the distinction for being the best-selling foreign artist of all time in Russia.

== Early life ==

Anders was born in Koblenz, West Germany and grew up in the small village of Mörz, a suburb of Münstermaifeld, with an older brother and a younger sister. His father worked as a civil servant at the local revenue service agency, while his mother ran a convenience store. He began showing interest in music early as a child, and subsequently took piano and singing lessons. He did his first stage-performance at the age of six, playing Saint Nicholas in a religious children&#x27;s play. At the age of ten, he entered a singing contest and won against 100 other children. As a prize, he performed over 300 times at a local music hall in Koblenz, offering a variety of children&#x27;s songs and Schlager music. During his childhood, he performed as &quot;Bernie von der Mosel&quot;.

Anders attended in Münstermaifeld. He finished his &#x27;Abitur&#x27; in 1982 at in Koblenz, to take advanced music classes. After that, he studied musicology, publishing and German studies for five semesters at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, with the intention to become a music journalist, while also trying to become a singer. However, after getting his big break as the lead singer of Modern Talking, he dropped out to focus on his career.

== Career ==

=== 1978–1983: Early career and attempts at German Schlager ===

Following a string of performances at several clubs and discothèques, Anders participated in a music contest organized by the radio station Radio Luxembourg in 1979, which he walked away from without earning enough points. Two days after the contest, Anders was offered a record contract by the same jury members of the radio contest. He signed his first record contract with CBS while still in school and took up the stage name of Thomas Anders, performing in the then-popular German Schlager genre. In 1980, at the age of 17, he published his first single, Schlager ballad &quot;Judy&quot;, which failed to chart. A year later, he appeared in German TV show &quot;Hätten Sie heut&#x27; Zeit für mich?&quot; and performed his second single, &quot;Du weinst um ihn&quot;, another Schlager ballad. Again, the song failed to make an impact, as did his third single, &quot;Es war die Nacht der ersten Liebe&quot;, an attempt at an upbeat Schlager song. Consequently, he was released by CBS in late 1981.

After finishing school, Anders signed a contract with Hansa Records in 1982. He next released another commercially unsuccessful Schlager ballad, &quot;Ich will nicht dein Leben&quot;, produced by fellow Schlager artist . 

In 1983, he was approached by Intersong, a subsidiary of Hansa, whether he was interested to record several German Schlager cover versions of English songs. Thus, he was introduced to producer Dieter Bohlen, with whom he recorded &quot;Was macht das schon?&quot;, the German cover version of F. R. David&#x27;s &quot;Pick Up the Phone&quot; and also &quot;Heißkalter Engel&quot;, the German cover version of Real Life&#x27;s &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot;. From late 1983 to the mid of 1984 Bohlen produced other tracks for Anders including &quot;Wovon träumst du denn&quot;, &quot;Endstation Sehnsucht&quot; and &quot;Es geht mir gut heut&#x27; Nacht&quot;, which he performed at German TV shows such as &quot;Night Club&quot;. As was the case with his previous attempts at Schlager music, however; all of these songs failed to achieve commercial or critical success.

=== 1983–1987: Breakthrough and worldwide success with Modern Talking ===

After both Bohlen and Anders had failed to achieve success in the Schlager genre, Bohlen pitched the idea of forming a Eurodisco duo consisting of Anders as lead singer and himself to BMG. The label agreed, however; they invested only little money in the project, resulting in low-budget videos and production. To capitalize on the popularity of the genre, they sang in easily accessible English lyrics, simple and catchy rhythms, and sported then-popular outfits. Modern Talking became an overnight sensation in 1985 when their video for &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;, originally released in October of the previous year, was shown in popular German music show &quot;&quot;. After that, the song occupied top ten positions in thirty-five countries, including their homeland, where it remained perched at the top of the charts for six consecutive weeks. The single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, reaching number one in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, as well as the European Hot 100. The track was then followed by another number-one hit in Germany and Austria, &quot;You Can Win If You Want&quot;, which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album &quot;The 1st Album&quot;. &quot;You Can Win If You Want&quot; eventually went gold and sold well over 250,000 units in Germany alone. The single also peaked at No. 8 in France where it also reached a gold status for sales of 500,000 units The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units. and reached the top ten in Belgium, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, and Switzerland.

Soon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single &quot;Cheri, Cheri Lady&quot; which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000, while the single itself went gold selling well over 250,000 units, as well as being certified silver in France for certified sales of 250,000 units. The success continued with two other number one singles, &quot;Brother Louie&quot; and &quot;Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)&quot; both from the third album &quot;Ready for Romance&quot;, giving them five consecutive number one hits in Germany. Both singles also had significant chart success worldwide. &quot;Brother Louie&quot; was their only hit in the UK, where it peaked at No. 4 in the charts and went silver for selling over 250,000 units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern Talking: UK&#x27;s Singles/Albums Positions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was also certified silver in France for selling over 250,000 units. The song also reached number one in Spain, South Africa and Sweden. The duo also charted high with their sixth single &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; from the fourth album &quot;In the Middle of Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; from their fifth album &quot;Romantic Warriors&quot;. Both singles reached the German top ten but where especially successful in Spain, where they reached number one and three, respectively. However, neither their fifth, nor their sixth album &quot;In the Garden of Venus&quot; managed to sell well and the latter one&#x27;s only single &quot;In 100 Years...&quot; only reached number 30 in Germany, while reaching number 4 in Spain. Furthermore, Modern Talking and Anders were especially successful in the Soviet Union, where they were one of the first Western bands allowed to sell their records and perform. During the 80s, the band sold over 60 million copies worldwide.

Due to their lacklusterly received sixth album, Bohlen terminated the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosity between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders&#x27; then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years. During their break-up, the band released a string of licensed greatest hits albums.

=== 1987–1998: Lackluster solo career and switch to pop music ===

Following the break-up of Modern Talking, Anders and his wife emigrated to the United States, where they were unknown. He then embarked on a world tour, where he performed Modern Talking&#x27;s hits, covering cities like Budapest, Ljubljana, Potsdam, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Moscow, Viña del Mar and Sun City. After that, he returned to his solo career, which, however, could not match his success with Modern Talking. In 1989, he released his first studio album as a solo artist, &quot;Different&quot;. Produced by Gus Dudgeon and Alan Tarney, the pop album abandoned his previous Schlager and Eurodisco attempts, but failed to chart. Nonetheless, its lead single, &quot;Love of My Own&quot; peaked at number 24 in Germany. He recorded an alternative English title track for the animated TV series &quot;Ducktales&quot; by Disney in 1990. In 1991, he released his second studio album, &quot;Whispers&quot;, which also failed to chart. &quot;Can&#x27;t Give You Anything (But My Love)&quot;, a cover of the eponymous song by The Stylistics, managed to reach number 73 on the German singles charts. The follow-up album &quot;Down on Sunset&quot;, released in 1992, produced the single &quot;How Deep is Your Love&quot;, which charted at number 71 in Germany, whereas the album again could not chart. Neither did his fourth album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;. The release was helmed by a cover of the song of the same name, which also featured original artists The Three Degrees, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Love You Forever&quot;, which charted at numbers 31 and 79 in Germany, respectively.

After this later lack of success in pop music, Anders decided to experiment with new styles for his next releases and moved back to Koblenz. His fifth studio album &quot;Barcos de Cristal&quot; (1994), was recorded completely in Spanish. In 1995, he released &quot;Souled&quot;, a soul album featuring covers of The Beatles, Stephanie Mills, as well as original songs and a duet with The Pointer Sisters. The same year, he portrayed the pop star Ypsilon in the episode &quot;Stockholm Marathon&quot; of the police procedural series &quot;Kommissar Beck&quot;. His 1997 live album &quot;Live Concert&quot; featured a jazz band and consisted entirely of jazz covers. However, neither release was commercially successful. Also in 1997, he starred in the musical short film &quot;Phantomschmerz&quot;.

=== 1998–2003: Modern Talking reunion and return to worldwide success ===
Bohlen and Anders had both opposed the recording of a proper greatest hits album for years. In late 1997, Bohlen suggested the recording of a new album instead and contacted Anders, who had signed a contract with Ariola for an eventual comeback several years prior. Combining the idea of a greatest hits album and a new release, it was decided to rerecord and remix their previous songs while adding a few new ones. The rerecording switched their style from Euro disco to the 1990s Eurodance, incorporating techno and additional rap vocals by Eric Singleton. In early 1998, the duo officially reunited during popular TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; and performed an updated version of &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot; It entered the top 5 in number of countries including Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, while entering the top 10 in many others including Sweden and Finland. In Germany, the single entered the top 10 on 6 April 1998, it peaked at number 2 the following week. After spending 10 weeks within the top 10, it eventually earned a platinum-award for selling over 500,000 units in Germany alone. In France, &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul &#x27;98&quot; peaked at no. 3 eventually earning a gold-award for selling over 250,000 units. &quot;Brother Louie &#x27;98&quot; was released in Germany and in other European territories on 20 July 1998. While, the single entered the top-20 in (Germany) and Austria, it managed to enter the top-10 in Sweden and the top-5 in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chartverfolgung/MODERN TALKING/Single&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In France, &quot;Brother Louie &#x27;98&quot; reached a gold status for selling over 250,000 units. The corresponding album &quot;Back For Good&quot; entered the number one position in Germany on 13 April 1998 and spent total of five weeks at the top, it eventually earned 5 gold-awards in Germany alone for selling over 1,250,000 units. &quot;Back for Good&quot; spent total of 54 weeks on the German album chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chartverfolgung/MODERN TALKING/Longplay&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Back for Good&quot; was also successful outside of Germany, topping the album charts of many other countries including Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and Austria. &quot;Back for Good&quot; eventually went on to sell over three million copies in Europe alone, and received various certifications in countries such as Spain, Norway, Latvia, Italy, or Belgium.

Their next albums were still highly successful, albeit not matching the success of &quot;Back for Good&quot;. In 2000, the album &quot;Alone&quot;, composed entirely of new songs, entered the German album chart at No. 1 on 8 March 1999 and spent four consecutive weeks at the top. After spending total of 27 weeks on the album chart, &quot;Alone&quot; eventually went platinum, shipping more than 500,000 units in Germany. Furthermore, the album was certified platinum in Poland, Sweden and Switzerland, while going gold in Spain, Finland and Austria. The singles &quot;Sexy, Sexy Lover&quot; and &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; were able to enter the top ten and even top five in various European countries. Coinciding with the Chinese calendar, their ninth studio album was titled &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, being certified platinum in Germany. The lead single &quot;China in Her Eyes&quot; reached number eight in Germany, while going as high as number 6 in Spain. A second song, &quot;No Face, No Name, No Number&quot; proved to be highly popular in Romania and Moldavia, where it reached number 1.

Their 2001 effort, &quot;America&quot;, failed to achieve a certification, but produced the hit single &quot;Win the Race&quot;, which became the anthem for Formula One in Germany for the 2001 series. The single peaked at No. 5 in Germany on 26 March 2001, exactly one month after its release. With their two final albums, &quot;Victory&quot; (2002) and &quot;Universe&quot; (2003), the band reached gold status in Germany. The singles &quot;Ready for the Victory&quot; and &quot;TV Makes the Superstar&quot; managed to peak at number 7 and 2, respectively.

Aside from performing with Modern Talking, Anders was also active as a producer and songwriter. For German &quot;Big Brother&quot; candidates Jürgen Milski and , he co-wrote &quot;Großer Bruder&quot;, which managed to stay at number 1 in Germany for 8 weeks and achieve platinum by selling 800.000 records. Furthermore, he produced girl group The It-Girls with &quot;My Heart It Feels Like (Dub Dub…)&quot; and wrote &quot;Cry for You&quot; for No Angels.

In 2003, Modern Talking dissolved again, again in controversial fashion. After a serious altercation before a concert in Rostock, Bohlen announced the end of the band live on stage, to the shock of Anders and the public. In his 2003 book &quot;Hinter den Kulissen&quot;, Bohlen further marginalized Anders&#x27; input to their music and accused him of stealing money from him. Anders subsequently sued Bohlen for libel and succeeded in having certain passages removed, but lost the lawsuit for compensation in 2005. In his 2011 book &quot;100% Anders&quot;, he called the way Bohlen broke the band up and his antics &quot;pathetic&quot;, and blamed him for breaking up the duo. Their final release, &quot;The Final Album&quot;, a greatest hits album, was released in August 2003.

=== 2003–2017: Success as a solo artist ===
Anders&#x27; third attempt at a solo career proved to be more successful, albeit unable to match the popularity of his Modern Talking periods. Shortly after the break-up of Modern Talking, Anders started recording his eighth solo album, pop effort &quot;This Time&quot;, which was released in February 2004. Unlike his previous attempts at a solo career, this album proved to be rather successful, climbing to the number 14 spot in Germany. Furthermore, the three singles from the album, &quot;Independent Girl&quot;, &quot;King of Love&quot;, and &quot;Tonight Is the Night&quot; charted at 17, 37, and 60 respectively, making &quot;This Time&quot; his biggest success as a solo artist in his native country. Furthermore, &quot;King of Love&quot; became a number 1 hit in Turkey, whereas &quot;Independent Girl&quot; reached number 1 in Russia. For the show Holiday on Ice, Anders composed and performed &quot;Just Dream&quot;, which reached number 64 in Germany. He took part as a jury member in Stefan Raab&#x27;s casting show &quot;SSDSGPS (Stefan sucht den Super Grand Prix Star)&quot;, which searched for the German entrant for the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest and was a competing event to Dieter Bohlen&#x27;s &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;. The same year and in 2009, he hosted the German companion show for the Eurovision Song Contest and became the host of &quot;Best of Formel Eins&quot; on Kabel1 in 2004. With his 2006 album &quot;Songs Forever&quot;, Anders again tried himself at swing cover songs, such as &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; or &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;. The album managed to peak at number 43 in Germany, but he failed to win the preliminaries to represent Germany during the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. Also, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, he hosted the accompanying music show &quot;&quot;Auf nach Berlin&quot; – WM-KultTour&quot;. In 2006, the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv made him an honorary professor for &quot;shaping the musical taste of a generation.&quot; Anders is especially successful in Eastern Europe, where he is considered a musical icon and still fills stadiums, while holding the distinction of being the most commercially successful foreign artist in Russia.

After not releasing any new material except a Christmas song and several features in 2008, as well as being featured on Sandra&#x27;s 2009 single &quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot;, which reached number 46 in Germany, Anders released another studio album in 2010. &quot;Strong&quot;, a return to electronic and pop, reached Platinum status in Russia for sales of more than 650.000 units, making him the best-selling international artist in Russia that year, while it failed to chart in Germany or other regions. The singles &quot;Why Do You Cry&quot; and &quot;Stay With Me&quot; also failed to make an impact, while the former peaked at No. 21 on Russian Airplay Chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Airplay Detection Top Hit 100 Weekly: 08/03/2010-14/03/2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he hosted music show &quot;Die neue Hitparade&quot; on RTL II. He returned to success with electronic and pop oriented &quot;Two&quot;, a 2011 collaboration album with German producer Jörn-Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, performing under the moniker Anders|Fahrenkrog. The album reached number 11 in Germany, his highest charting release not with Modern Talking, and the single &quot;Gigolo&quot; climbed to number 40. In November 2012, Anders released a new solo album called &quot;Christmas for You&quot;. It includes seasonal hits such as &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; as well as covers of well-known classics such as &quot;Silent Night&quot; and Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;. On 9 August 2013, Anders in collaboration with Persian singer Omid Soltani released the song &quot;We Are One&quot;. Due to the success of the releases in the vein of his Modern Talking era hits, he released the album &quot;History&quot; in 2016, which featured two new songs as well as new renditions of most Modern Talking singles. It peaked at number 42 in Germany.

=== 2017–present: Return to German language music ===

In April 2017, Anders released his first German language song in almost 35 years, &quot;Der beste Tag meines Lebens&quot; (&quot;The best day of my life&quot;). While it failed to chart, the accompanying studio album &quot;Pures Leben&quot; (&quot;Pure Life&quot;), promoted as his first German language release, peaked at number 14 in Germany. Anders has stated that he was pleasantly surprised by the album&#x27;s success, asserting that he is more popular abroad than in his home country, fully knowing that people would most likely be indifferent to a German language album by him. On 1 May 2018, Anders was announced as a judge on the revival of the German version of &quot;X Factor&quot;. Later that year, he released his second German language album, &quot;Ewig mit dir&quot; (&quot;Forever with you&quot;), which managed to climb to number 12 on the German albums chart. It produced two singles, &quot;Das Leben ist jetzt&quot; (&quot;Life is now&quot;) and &quot;Sie sagte doch sie liebt mich&quot; (&quot;But she said she loved me&quot;), a duet with Florian Silbereisen, which managed to reach number 70 on the German singles chart.

== Personal life ==

Anders is the son of Helga and Peter Weidung. He has one brother, Achim, and one sister, Tania. He was married to Nora Balling from 1984 to 1999. On 15 July 2000 he married to Claudia Hess. They have one son, Alexander Mick Weidung who was born on 27 June 2002.

Ivanić&#x27;s political career began in 1988, when he became a member of the Presidency of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina during Yugoslav Socialist times.

From 2001 until 2003, he was Prime Minister of Republika Srpska, one of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s two entities. He also served as minister of foreign affairs, succeeding Zlatko Lagumdžija on the post, and as such was a member of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina (i.e. the national government). In turn, he was succeeded on the post in 2007 by Sven Alkalaj. Ivanić is a founding member of the center-right Bosnian Serb Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) and was its president from 1999 to 2015.

==Presidency (2014–2018)==
===2014 general election===
The Alliance for Change, a coalition formed around the Serb Democratic Party and Ivanić&#x27;s PDP, amongst some other parties as well, announced on 14 July 2014 that Ivanić would run in the Bosnian general election as a candidate for Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s three-person Presidency member, representing the Serbs. 

At the general election, held on 12 October 2014, Ivanić was elected to the Presidency, having obtained 48.71% of the vote, narrowly beating the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats&#x27; (SNSD) candidate, the Republika Srpska prime minister Željka Cvijanović, who obtained 47.56% of the vote. His victory marked the first time since the Dayton Agreement that a Serb member of the Presidency received the highest number of votes in the country, out of the three elected members. He was then Chairman of the Presidency from November 2014 to July 2015 and again from November 2016 to July 2017.

===2018 general election===
At the 2018 general election, held on 7 October, Ivanić lost his bid for re-election to the Bosnian Presidency to SNSD&#x27;s leader and Republika Srpska president Milorad Dodik. Dodik obtained 53.88% of the vote, while Ivanić was second with 42.74%.

===Domestic policy===
====Attitudes towards the Republika Srpska referendum====
A referendum on the National Day of Republika Srpska, called the &quot;Day of Republika Srpska&quot; was held on 25 September 2016. A year prior, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ruled against the constitutionality of the holiday, deeming it discriminatory against non-Serbs in the entity. Republika Srpska authorities reacted by contesting the decision of the Constitutional Court and calling for constitutional amendments within 120 days to get rid of international judges serving in the Court, simultaneously calling for a popular referendum on whether Republika Srpska citizens support the decision of the Court. On 9 January 2016, the entity&#x27;s authorities celebrated the &quot;unconstitutional&quot; holiday, in spite of the Court ruling.

About the National Day referendum announced by Milorad Dodik regarding the legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ivanić stated:
The National Assembly of Republika Srpska passed a resolution on the referendum on 15 July 2016, with the backing of all Serb parties and the boycott of Bosniak National Assembly members. The result of the referendum was 99.8% in favour of supporting the National Day.

===Foreign policy===
On 7 June 2015, Ivanić met with Pope Francis in Sarajevo, as part of the Popes&#x27;s 2015 papal visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In March 2017, he visited Jerusalem and met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While in Jerusalem, Ivanić talked about the Jewish community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, saying that &quot;the community should not expect property expropriated during the Holocaust in Bosnia to be given back or to be compensated for its seizure. A restitution law had at one time been created in Bosnia, but fell by the wayside because the process would be too complicated. The seized properties were taken over by the Yugoslav Communists after the war, then privatised, while some of them have been demolished or replaced.&quot; Ivanić further insisted that he would restore the property or give compensation if he could, but that the matter was not in his hands.

====European Union====
Ivanić advocated Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s accession to the European Union. In an interview with web portal &quot;European Western Balkans&quot; in January 2016, he stated that &quot;by joining the EU, Bosnia and Herzegovina would receive rules that were developed by a third party, and thus internal differences would become less important. It is also a good economic space.&quot; Ivanić mentioned the slowness of the Bosnian authorities in making decisions as possible difficulties that the country could face, and pointed out that this is why reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina is needed.

==Personal life==
Mladen is married to Gordana Ivanić, and together they have two children. They live in Banja Luka.

He is fluent in English.

<text>Karlrobert Kreiten (26 June 1916, Bonn, Rhine Province – 7 September 1943) was a German pianist, albeit holding Dutch citizenship his entire life due to his Dutch father.

== Biography ==
He was regarded by Wilhelm Furtwängler and others to be one of the most talented young pianists in Germany. Born in Bonn, his German mother was the classical singer Emmy Kreiten, née Liebergesell, who sang under the stage name Emmy Kreiten-Barido. His father Theo Kreiten, was a Dutch composer, concert pianist, and writer. The Kreiten family originated in the area of the Lower Rhineland, near the current Dutch-German border.

He made his debut at the age of eleven with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A major in a live broadcast. He was educated in Berlin by Claudio Arrau.

Kreiten was reported to the Gestapo by Nazi neighbor Ellen Ott-Monecke for allegedly making negative remarks about Adolf Hitler and the war effort. He was indicted at the Volksgerichtshof, with Roland Freisler presiding, and condemned to death. Once a student of the famous pianist Claudio Arrau, Karlrobert Kreiten had influential friends. But even the intervention of the equally famous conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler couldn&#x27;t prevent his arrest and execution. Friends and family frantically tried to save his life, but to no avail. The family only accidentally learned that Karlrobert had been executed by hanging, with 185 other inmates, at Plötzensee Prison. An appeal for clemency was approved the day after the execution.

Emmy Kreiten, Karlrobert&#x27;s mother, later showed fellow musicians an invoice she had received from the prison: The family actually had to pay the prison fees, even for the rope used to hang her son. Everything itemized in Reichsmark, line by line, down to the last Reichspfennig.

Because family members of an executed &quot;traitor&quot; couldn&#x27;t be safe from regime terror, Theo and Emmy Kreiten and their daughter Rosemarie emigrated to Alsace, returning to Düsseldorf after war&#x27;s end. His execution triggered a wave of articles in the German press about this &quot;treacherous&quot; artist. Prominent journalist Werner Höfer had to retire in 1987 when his articles about Kreiten received publicity.
Today in Berlin, a memorial of the life and death of Kreiten exists along the &quot;Topography of Terror&quot; outdoor exhibit, which deals with the terror inflicted by the German SS and the Gestapo. The very prison cells that held him and others arrested by the Gestapo have been unearthed and remain laid bare for all to see. Streets in Düsseldorf, Bonn, Hilden and Cologne have been named in his honor. His only sister, Rosemarie von Studnitz, became a book publisher in the United States and died in 1975. In September 2003 the Dutch composer Rudi Martinus van Dijk had his work &quot;Kreiten’s Passion&quot; for baritone, full choir and symphony orchestra premiered in Düsseldorf by the Düsseldorf Symfoniker in memoriam of Karlrobert Kreiten.

<text>Louis Jourdan (born Louis Robert Gendre; 19 June 1921 – 14 February 2015) was a French film and television actor. He was known for his suave roles in several Hollywood films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947), &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (1948), &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959), &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963) and &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983). He played Dracula in the 1977 BBC television production &quot;Count Dracula&quot;.

==Early life==
Jourdan was born Louis Robert Gendre in Marseille, France, in 1921, one of three sons of Yvonne (née Jourdan) and Henry Gendre, a hotel owner. He was educated in France, Turkey, and the UK, and studied acting at the École Dramatique. While there, he began acting on the professional stage, where he was brought to the attention of director Marc Allégret, who hired him to work as an assistant camera operator on &quot;Entrée des Artistes&quot; (&quot;The Curtain Rises&quot;).

Allegret then cast Jourdan in what should have been his first movie, &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; in 1939 opposite Charles Boyer. Filming was interrupted by the Second World War and was never resumed.

==World War II==
During the war he was hired by Marcel L&#x27;Herbier to appear in &quot;La Comédie du bonheur&quot; (1940) in Rome. He was making &quot;Untel Père et Fils&quot; in that city when Italy declared war on France.
He returned to France, and appeared in &quot;Premier rendez-vous&quot; (1941) with Danielle Darrieux, shot in Paris. He spent a year on a work gang. Jourdan was ordered to make German propaganda films, which he refused to do, and fled to join his family in unoccupied France.

There he started making movies again, ten films in two years. They included several for Allegret: &quot;Parade en sept nuits&quot; (1941); &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne&quot; (1942) with Raimu, &quot;The Beautiful Adventure&quot; (1942); &quot;Les Petites du quai aux fleurs&quot; (1944); &quot;Twilight&quot; (1944). He was in &quot;The Heart of a Nation&quot; (1943) with Raimu; &quot;La Vie de Bohème&quot; (1945).

His father was arrested by the Gestapo; months later he escaped, and joined the French Resistance, along with his family. &quot;I was given work to do and I did it&quot;, said Jourdan later of his time in the resistance. &quot;I worked on illegal leaflets, helping to print and distribute them.&quot; After the liberation of France in 1945, he returned to Paris with his childhood sweetheart, Berthe Frédérique (nicknamed &quot;Quique&quot;). They married in 1946.

==Hollywood career==
===David O. Selznick===
Cited by author James McKay as the &quot;epitome of the suave Continental&quot;, Jourdan was spotted in a French film by a talent scout working for 1946 David O. Selznick, who offered the actor a contract in March 1946.

His first American film was &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947) starring Gregory Peck. The movie is a drama directed by Alfred Hitchcock, who did not want Jourdan cast as the valet in the film. He appeared in a theatre production of &quot;Ghosts&quot; in Los Angeles.

Jourdan frequently argued with Selznick, who put him on suspension a number of times for refusing roles.

Selznick announced Jourdan and Alida Valli for &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; but the film was not made. Neither was &quot;Trilby&quot; which Selznick said Jourdan would appear in with Valli and Rossano Brazzi or &quot;If This Be My Heart&quot; with Valli and Robert Mitchum.

With Joan Fontaine, Jourdan starred in the Max Ophüls film &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (1948). David Thomson in 2010 observed how his performance as Stefan Brand altered as the character aged over the extended period of the film&#x27;s narrative: &quot;I notice how his way of talking has changed. The younger Stefan was boyish, eager and open. Ten years later, the man is filled with self-loathing and fake ironies.&quot; It was a &quot;signature performance&quot; from Jourdan, Thomson wrote in &quot;Have You Seen?&quot;, he was &quot;handsome yet a touch empty; romantic yet not entirely there.&quot; John Houseman, the film&#x27;s producer, &quot;felt he lacked sex appeal, but that shortcoming serves very well as his defect of memory&quot;, a significant element of the film&#x27;s plot. In Hollywood, Jourdan became friends with several stars who shared his love of the game of croquet.

Enterprise borrowed him for &quot;No Minor Vices&quot; (1948), a box office flop. It was released by MGM, who borrowed Jourdan to appear in &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1949).

Selznick announced him for &quot;The Frenchman and the Bobbysoxer&quot; a sequel to &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; but it was not made. Selznick sold his interest in Jourdan for one film to Warner Bros.

All Jourdan&#x27;s Hollywood films had lost money. He decided to buy out his contract with Selznick for $50,000.

===Post-Selznick===
 
At 20th Century Fox, Jourdan played the lead in a remake of &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1951). The studio kept him on to appear in &quot;Anne of the Indies&quot; (1951), directed by Jacques Tourneur. He was announced for the romantic male lead in the Fox remake of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; but ended up not appearing in the film.

He was in a comedy, &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1952). He was reunited with Joan Fontaine for &quot;Decameron Nights&quot; (1953) then returned home to France to make &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Estrapade&quot; (1953).

After appearing in &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954), Jourdan made his Broadway début in the lead role in the Billy Rose stage adaptation of André Gide&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Immoralist&quot;.

He returned to Broadway for a short run in 1955, and also that year he made his American TV début as Inspector Beaumont in the TV series &quot;Paris Precinct&quot;. In 1956, he appeared in the film &quot;The Swan&quot; playing the role of &quot;Dr Nicholas Agi&quot; along with Grace Kelly and Alec Guinness for MGM. This was Kelly&#x27;s last film, and lost money at the box office. More popular was &quot;Julie&quot; (1956) a thriller where Jourdan tormented Doris Day.

He returned to France to play the male lead in &quot;The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful&quot; (1956) with Brigitte Bardot as the lead actress, and &quot;Escapade&quot; (1957). In Britain he appeared in a swashbuckler, &quot;Dangerous Exile&quot; (1957).

Jourdan appeared in his biggest hit playing the romantic lead alongside Leslie Caron and Maurice Chevalier in the film version of the novella by Colette, &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958). This film won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He enjoyed another hit with &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959), an all star romance in the vein of &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;. He also appeared in a variety show on TV, &quot;An Evening with Louis Jourdan&quot;.

Jourdan was going to follow it in a remake of &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; in England for Terence Fisher. &quot;It&#x27;s a terrific change of pace for me&quot;, he said. However he did not appear in the final film, &quot;The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll&quot;.

Jourdan co-starred with Frank Sinatra, Chevalier and Shirley MacLaine in the musical &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1960). He travelled to Italy to appear in a peplum film, &quot;Amazons of Rome&quot; (1961). Then it was back to France to star in a version of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1961), a massive hit in France. &quot;Disorder&quot; (1962) was an Italian-French comedy, &quot;Mathias Sandorf&quot; (1963) was based on a novel by Jules Verne.

For MGM, he made &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963), another all star melodrama, and a big hit.

Jourdan also sang in the Alan Jay Lerner/Barton Lane stage musical, &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; (1965), at least during its out-of-town tryout at the Colonial Theatre in Boston. He was replaced as leading man by John Cullum before the show reached Broadway.

He supported Ann-Margret in &quot;Made in Paris&quot; (1966) for MGM, then returned to Europe: &quot;The Sultans&quot; (1967), &quot;To Commit a Murder&quot; (1967), &quot;Cervantes&quot; (1967). &quot;To Die in Paris&quot; (1968) was a US TV movie and &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; (1968) a Hollywood financed farce.

There were more TV movies: &quot;Fear No Evil&quot; (1969), &quot;Run a Crooked Mile&quot; (1970), &quot;Ritual of Evil&quot; (1970), &quot;The Great American Beauty Contest&quot; (1973). In later years, Jourdan also appeared on television, including 1977&#x27;s &quot;Count Dracula&quot; for the BBC and as a murderous food critic in the 1978 &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Murder Under Glass&quot;.

===Later career===
Jourdan later played Anton Arcane in the movie &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982) and in its sequel &quot;The Return of Swamp Thing&quot; (1989).

During the 1970s, Jourdan recorded a series of spoken word albums of the &quot;Babar the Elephant&quot; books that were released by Caedmon Records.

In 1983, Jourdan played the villainous Kamal Khan in the James Bond movie &quot;Octopussy&quot;. He said at the time he earned most of his money over the past ten years doing commercials:
 I take them so seriously that I participate in the original concept and the actual writing. After all, whatever an actor is doing, he&#x27;s a salesman, so why not commercials? I must confess I love the theater best, though. I&#x27;ve never done a play I didn&#x27;t like, but one often does movies just to keep functioning. They&#x27;re less important to me than plays.
In 1985, he appeared in a stage revival of &quot;Gigi&quot;.

He played the role of French educator, historian and Baron, Pierre de Coubertin (1863–1937), in &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;, a May 1984 NBC TV (2-part) mini-series about the 1896 Summer Olympics and the American team member/discus thrower from Baltimore, Robert Garrett (1875–1961). His last film role was eight years later in &quot;Year of the Comet&quot; (1992).

==Personal life==
On Jourdan married his childhood sweetheart, Berthe Frédérique. The marriage produced one child, Louis Henry Jourdan, born on 6 October 1951, and lasted until her death in 2014. Louis Henry Jourdan died of a narcotics overdose at the age of 29 on 12 May 1981; his body was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

After his retirement from acting in 1992 Jourdan lived in Los Angeles. In July 2010 he was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur, an honor that he received accompanied by friends, including Sidney Poitier and Kirk Douglas.

Jourdan has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6153 and 6445 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Death==
Jourdan died at his home in Beverly Hills on 14 February 2015 at the age of 93. His body was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="541782" wikidata="Q1277699" url="?curid=541782" title="EastLink (Melbourne)">
<text>EastLink is a tolled section of the M3 freeway linking a large area through the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia.

EastLink is electronically tolled with no cash booths, using a system developed by SICE. The SICE Tolling System is similar to (and interoperable with) the &quot;e-TAG&quot; system used on the CityLink tollway. EastLink was opened to traffic on Sunday 29 June 2008 and in conjunction with the opening, a month-long toll-free period occurred before regular tolling commenced on 27 July 2008.

The project was constructed by a joint venture of Australian construction companies Thiess Contractors and John Holland, with tolling system contracted to SICE, and mechanical and electrical work contracted to United Group Infrastructure. The final project cost was A$2.5 billion.

Signs at the entrances and on the tollway direct to Ringwood, Dandenong, Frankston and Doncaster.

==History==

The road was originally shown in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as the F35 Freeway.

The freeway has been a contentious issue, amid concerns over environmental damage and the possibility it would lead to a &#x27;complete&#x27; metropolitan ring road. In October 1999, the incoming Bracks Government announced that the freeway (which Labor had not promised at the election) had been scrapped. Instead the government promised to investigate a preferred route for the Rowville railway line and extend tram route 75 to Knox, neither of which have eventuated. However, in a &quot;major policy about-face&quot;, the Bracks Government announced in August 2000 that it would seek federal funding for the freeway. To obtain funding, the freeway would need to be classified as a road of &quot;national importance&quot;, despite the fact that it did not form part of the national highway system. The &quot;U-turn&quot;&#x27; on the freeway was strongly criticised by opponents such as the Public Transport Users Association, because it would result in proposed public transport alternatives, such as the Rowville railway line, being scrapped.

In 2001, University of Melbourne academic Paul Mees launched legal action in the Federal Court seeking an injunction, under section 475 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, to prevent Transport Minister Peter Batchelor and the Roads Corporation (VicRoads) from &quot;taking any further action relating to the construction of the Scoresby freeway or the Eastern Ring Road&quot;. He alleged that the freeway would threaten migratory birds, plant species and wetlands and that the freeway was part of a larger plan to build a metropolitan ring road to Greensborough. In light of the court case, state government bureaucrats removed references to the metropolitan ring road from a draft Metropolitan Strategy.

In 2003, the &quot;Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority&quot; (SEITA) was established by the Victorian Government, to manage and oversee the project on behalf of the government. SEITA was responsible for managing the process of selecting a private sector bidder.

In October 2004, SEITA awarded the contract for the design, construction, and operation of EastLink to ConnectEast, a company that was publicly listed on the ASX in November 2004. ConnectEast subsequently contracted Thiess John Holland, a group formed by the partnership of two major construction companies, to carry out the detailed design and construction of EastLink.

ConnectEast, as owner of the road, is responsible for its day-to-day management until the concession deed expires in 2043. EastLink&#x27;s construction began in March 2005, and the road opened on 29 June 2008.

The opening of the road on 29 June 2008 saw traffic on nearby Stud, Springvale and Blackburn Roads drop by 30% to 40%, but traffic on the Eastern Freeway rose by 5 per cent at the Burke Road intersection, and by about 1–2 per cent at Hoddle Street in the city. On average 270,868 cars, trucks and motorbikes travelled on the road every day until the tolling was introduced on 23 July. In the first week after the introduction of tolls, the average number of daily trips fell to 133,722. This was in line with estimates of a 40 to 50 per cent decline, but is a third below prospectus forecasts. The average toll per trip was $3.10 – above the estimate of $2.91.

In its first six months of operation, Eastlink made a loss of almost $93 million. In 2010, the road had to be refinanced, with its traffic forecasts rewritten due to lower than expected traffic volumes.

===Naming history===
Over the years the project was variously referred to as the &quot;Eastern Ring Road&quot;, &quot;Scoresby Freeway&quot;, &quot;Scoresby Bypass&quot;, and &quot;Mitcham-Frankston Freeway&quot;.

On 23 March 2005, with the beginning of construction on the project, then Premier Steve Bracks announced that the road would be called &quot;EastLink&quot;, at a ceremony in Rowville. The new name was reportedly chosen because it was easier to say, apparently easier to remember, and would fit on street directories.

On 27 February 2008, it was announced that the EastLink / Monash Freeway interchange would be named the &quot;Tom Wills Interchange&quot;, after the founder of Australian rules football Tom Wills. On 24 March 2008, Roads Minister Tim Pallas announced that the twin tunnels would be named &quot;Melba&quot; and &quot;Mullum Mullum&quot;, in the inbound and outbound direction respectively.

==Route==
EastLink begins at the eastern end of the Eastern Freeway at Springvale Road in Nunawading, before tunnelling eastward towards Ringwood under the Mullum Mullum Creek area. It then travels 40 km south towards Frankston, passing through the suburbs of Wantirna, Wantirna South, Scoresby, Rowville, Mulgrave, Dandenong North, Noble Park, Keysborough, Dandenong South, Bangholme, and Carrum Downs, before ending at the northern end of the Frankston Freeway. The majority of the freeway has three lanes running in each direction, while between Thompson Rd and Frankston Freeway, there are 2 lanes running in each direction.

The standard travel time on EastLink in both directions, is 26 minutes, (12 minutes between Frankston Freeway / Peninsula Link and the Monash Freeway, 7 minutes between the Monash Freeway and the Burwood Highway and 7 minutes between the Burwood Highway and Springvale Road). Typical travel time is between 30 and 40 minutes.

EastLink does not regularly have peak period congestion like other urban metropolitan freeways in Melbourne. However, delays can be experienced following roadworks or they might be residual, following an incident. Occasionally, traffic congestion occurs between Thompsons Road and the junction with the other three freeways in Carrum Downs, where the freeway changes from three to two lanes. If the congestion builds, the travel time can reach 40 minutes or beyond.

==Exits and interchanges==














==Dandenong Bypass==

A 4.8 km section of the Dingley Freeway called the &quot;Dandenong Bypass&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;Dandenong Southern Bypass&quot; during its construction) was built by ConnectEast and Thiess John Holland as part of the EastLink project. The bypass opened on 9 December 2007.

==Tolling==
EastLink is electronically tolled via a system commercially called &quot;Breeze&quot;, entirely provided by SICE, Spanish system integrator company with broad experience in the tolling market. This system is fully interoperable with all other tollways in Australia, including the Transurban e-TAG system used on CityLink.

The system features a uniquely designed electronic vehicle tag, the &quot;Breeze Tag&quot;, which is about half the size of the standard design of e-TAG. The Breeze system is provided by Spanish company SICE, with the Road Side Equipment, including the Breeze Tags, provided by Swedish firm Kapsch TrafficCom AB, under the &quot;PREMID&quot; brand of DSRC products.

Tolls on EastLink can be charged in three different ways:
* By having any Australian electronic tolling &quot;tag&quot; (such as a Breeze Tag, or Transurban&#x27;s e-TAG) in the vehicle. Tolls are charged to the corresponding tag account.
* By registering a &quot;Breeze non-tag account&quot; with ConnectEast. A photograph of the number plate(s) of each vehicle is taken and matched to an account, charging the account holder the toll plus a small processing fee (30c, waived for motorcycles). Alternatively, &quot;Access&quot; accounts registered with CityLink may also be used in this manner. Vehicles with metalised windscreens which cannot be electronically scanned will avoid the extra fee if the owner registers it with Eastlink as such. The toll is then charged to the account by number plate recognition.
* By purchasing a &quot;trip pass&quot; valid for a single one-way trip on EastLink from ConnectEast either over the telephone, via the EastLink website, or from a retail outlet. Vehicle recognition for trip passes is done the same way as for non-tag accounts. Drivers can purchase multiple trip passes at once, as passes are stored until used. However, trip passes expire six months from the date of purchase.

If a driver travels on EastLink without taking any of the three actions above to pay for the toll(s) either prior to, or within three days after travel, an invoice for cost of the toll(s) plus an account processing fee will be sent to the registered vehicle&#x27;s owner. If the toll invoice is not paid, an overdue notice (with an additional processing fee) is issued. If the invoice is still not paid, a fine is issued by Victoria Police.

The concession period held by ConnectEast is due to end on 30 November 2043, after which the ownership of the road will be transferred to the state.

===Prices and discounts===

Multiple toll points are located along the EastLink, with each toll point charging a fixed fee. The total toll incurred per trip is the smaller of the trip cap or the total price of toll points passed through. The exception is taxis which pay a fixed price for travel on any section south of Maroondah Highway, regardless of the distance travelled or number of toll points passed through.

The cheapest toll points are located between Maroondah Highway and High Street Road, with slightly more expensive toll points located in the longer sections near the south of the tollway, and the most expensive one within the tunnel section between Maroondah Highway / Ringwood Bypass and Springvale Road. Motorcycle prices are half of cars, while higher rates apply for larger vehicles.

Discounts are also offered to car drivers. A 20 per cent discount applies to the cost of any car trip(s) taken on a Saturday or Sunday and also to one way trips between two consecutive interchanges (excluding the tunnels) on weekdays.


==Traffic impact on surrounding roads==
Whilst the construction of Eastlink alleviated congestion on Springvale Road, it has had the effect of funnelling the traffic onto other roads, particularly increasing traffic on the Eastern Freeway. Many local councils, organisation, community groups and individuals expressed concerns throughout the proposal and construction phases, over the alterations to traffic patterns and flows and how Eastlink would impact upon local roads in their respective areas. In 2009, the City of Manningham was able to conduct a traffic report which found that:
* Traffic on the Eastern Freeway increased &quot;significantly&quot;
* Travel times in peak and off-peak periods at the Eastern Freeway/Hoddle Street interchange had increased &quot;significantly&quot;
* Peak hour congestion at the Eastern Freeway/Bulleen Road interchange had increased.
* 20% decrease in traffic at the Springvale Road outbound offramp.
* 13% increase in traffic on Bulleen Road north of the Eastern Freeway.
* 13% decrease in traffic on Park Road, between Heads &amp; Mitcham Roads.
* 11% decrease in traffic on Doncaster Road, west of Middleborough Road.
* 8% increase in traffic on Fitzsimmons Lane, north of Porter Street.
* 2% increase in traffic on Manningham Road.
* 2% decrease in traffic on Reynolds Road, between Blackburn Road and Springvale Road.

Another study conducted by Banyule Council showed that, since EastLink opened in June 2008, 800 more trucks a day use main roads in Heidelberg and Rosanna.

In general, it appears as though Eastlink has funnelled large amounts of traffic onto the Eastern Freeway and has attracted an increase in commuters using arterial roads in local areas. Decreases appear to be on small stretches of local roads where Eastlink provides a quicker alternative.

==Shared path==
The EastLink Trail is a shared walking and cycle path that follows a similar north–south route to the EastLink project. Using it, cyclists and pedestrians are able to cycle or walk most of the distance of the road, along a 3-metre wide dedicated concrete path. Many major roads are crossed via under or over passes. Some roads, such as High Street Road (and until November 2009, Burwood Highway), require crossing the road at grade.

In wet weather, two underpasses are not trafficable as they have been built on floodways. These are the Ferntree Gully Road underpass and the Wellington Road underpass. After a medium amount of rain the underpasses flood and trail users must cross over the major roads to continue along the path. This can prove dangerous and during peak traffic times, trail users are known to have waited up to 20 minutes to safely cross the roads when the underpasses have flooded.

The Eastlink trail stops in Dandenong and does not continue. Users may take the Dandenong Creek Trail from this point which will take them to Carrum, where they will be able to join the Peninsula Link trail to Frankston and Mornington.

For those using the trail, substantial deviations from EastLink must be taken into account in travel times as the shared path does not follow the freeway in many cases as existing trails were joined up to the trails specifically built during the construction of the road. This has led to some very twisty sections of trail and in some cases, detours of over 3 km from the EastLink.


==Accidents==
On 18 February 2010, at 3.15 pm, a semi-trailer lost control on the north-bound side of the tollway, 300m from the Wellington Rd exit. The truck crossed the road and crashed through the median safety barrier, before crashing into a large pylon holding up a road sign gantry. The truck exploded into flames and the driver was killed. The tollway was closed in both directions, the first time since the road opened, between the Monash Freeway and Ferntree Gully Road. It remained closed until the early hours of the following morning so police could conduct an investigation and ConnectEast could carry out repairs to make the road safe to reopen. The police report is yet to be finalised.

==Controversies==


* A notable controversy surrounding this project has been the issue of tolls. The Victorian Government, led by Steve Bracks, initially planned not to build the road, instead promising to invest in public transport. Though the government reversed their policy position and decided to go ahead with the road instead. They gave an undertaking that the road would be toll free, a promise on which they later reneged. This led to a total withdrawal of what had been partial federal funding of the project. This policy change has caused much debate, discussion and resentment in some quarters. The Victorian Government&#x27;s position is that project was not viable without tolls.
* The Federal government withdrawal of funding was based on the premise that funding was only available for the road if the road was toll free. However, at the same time, they were also funding a tolled freeway in Sydney, the Westlink freeway. This led to the controversial belief in some quarters that the funding withdrawal was solely designed to discredit the Victorian Government, rather than being driven by a reluctance to fund toll roads.
* The then Victorian State opposition, led by Robert Doyle, initially opposed any form of tolling on the road. Subsequently, this policy was changed to support tolls. After the 2010 state election, the state leadership led by Liberal leader Ted Baillieu continues to support tolls.
* A court case was heard, where the plaintiffs argued that constructing EastLink would result in pressure to build the &quot;missing link&quot; (North East Link) between EastLink and the Metropolitan Ring Road. They claimed that such a freeway would damage the environmentally sensitive green wedges through either Eltham and Warrandyte or Heidelberg and the Yarra Flats. In October 2018 the Andrews government committed to build North East Link if it is victorious in the 2018 State Election.
* During the planning stages of the project, businesses in the Rutherford Road industrial area (located at the southern terminus of the freeway) wanted access via on/off ramps to the Mornington Peninsula Freeway and Frankston Freeway, in addition to EastLink. Prior to this project they had an off ramp only from the Mornington Peninsula Freeway into the industrial area. Under Eastlink, this was retained, but no on ramps were designed or constructed to link to the existing roads. The Mornington Peninsula Freeway, and the Frankston Freeway, despite being on their doorstep are only accessible via residential roads. The only on ramp from Rutherford Road takes traffic onto EastLink, Northbound.
* Although there is speculation that existing public roads will be restricted to increase traffic on Eastlink , there is legislation in place prohibiting the restriction of traffic , and SEITA has stated that &quot;Importantly, the State Government has passed legislation to maintain the existing capacity on arterial roads. The EastLink Act and the contract between the State of Victoria and ConnectEast prohibits closing or narrowing any existing roads in an attempt to force people onto EastLink.&quot; 
* On 28 August 2006, due to the late completion of bridge preparation works on the Belgrave and Lilydale railway line, the line was closed for the morning with inadequate warning to commuters of the closure of the line between Blackburn and Ringwood stations causing chaos at Ringwood where lengthy queues formed for the replacement buses. Passengers at Heatherdale, Mitcham and Nunawading stations were stranded because of the mess where the delay was caused by the portable crane &quot;Snow White&quot; being unable to operate near the rail line where bridge supports are being constructed. The ground was too soft for the crane and gravel had to be ordered in causing the delay. Theiss John Holland were required to pay penalties to Connex Melbourne while commuters were not reimbursed. Some of the more willing commuters set about the one-hour walk to Blackburn. Those individuals managed to arrive well before other commuters that had been caught in the confusion at Ringwood, by an hour or more.

==Environmental issues==


Many environmental groups in Melbourne&#x27;s east and south-east objected to the project, due to a number of factors, including vehicle emissions and disruption of habitat (in places such as the Mullum Mullum Valley and Dandenong Valley Wetlands). However, the road was the subject of an extensive Environmental Effects Statement (June 1998), which was followed by an extensive public hearing process in April 1999 before the final Government decision to proceed. The statement predicted an 18.5per cent increase in carbon dioxide, impacts on groundwater and wetlands, high impacts on areas of conservation value and the potential to affect 38 species of rare or threatened fauna and flora if the freeway was built.

According to EastLink&#x27;s builders, the road will relieve traffic congestion throughout Melbourne&#x27;s eastern and south-eastern suburbs, resulting in more efficient traffic flow, therefore reducing fuel consumption and exhaust output. However, like all such road projects, the phenomenon of induced demand will work against the realisation of those benefits.

During the planning phase (then a VicRoads project), a large debate surrounding damage to the Mullum Mullum Valley occurred. A number of options for the path of the road through the valley were considered. The option chosen – for two 1.6 km tunnels – was the second-to-most expensive, and the second-to-most environmentally friendly. Other options considered in planning included a surface road for the entire length, much shorter tunnels, and slightly longer tunnels.

However, despite the attention on tunnelling beneath the Mullum Mullum Gorge, the Ringwood Interchange is entirely above-ground and has resulted in relocation of the creek through this area.

The Curonian Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is split between Klaipėda County, Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The Lithuanian side of the spit is separated from mainland Lithuania via a small opening between Klaipėda and Smiltynė where the Curonian Lagoon drains into the Baltic Sea.

Skuodas district is the source of the Šventoji, which flows north into Courland, Latvia, back down into Klaipeda County before draining into the Baltic Sea at the coastal settlement of Šventoji.

It borders the Tauragė County in the north, Kaunas County and Alytus County in the east, Podlaskie Voivodeship of Poland in the south and Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia in the west.

== History ==

The county includes part of the ancient Sudovian lands. After the long fights with the Teutonic Order in the late 13th - 14th centuries, most of the old inhabitants of Sudovia were decimated and the land was ravaged. Sudovia began to recover in the late 15th century, when settlers from various parts of Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to occupy former Sudovian lands. The close proximity to Poland and Prussia allowed the new settlers to establish close trade links.

During the Kościuszko Uprising, in 1794, Vilkaviškis was the site of a battle between Polish insurgents and Prussian troops. After the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Sudovia became part of Prussia. The former established the Marijampolė County, which was initially called Starapolė-Senapilė County.

In 1807, it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815, the region became part of newly established Congress Poland, which was under Russian rule. It was successively part of the administrative units of Łomża Department, Augustów Voivodeship, Augustów Governorate and Suwałki Governorate. It was the place of multiple battles of the November and January Uprisings against Russian rule. 

During the years of Lithuanian press ban, Sudovia was an important route for Knygnešiai (Lithuanian book smugglers) due to the region&#x27;s proximity to the border of Lithuania Minor, where Lithuanian press was still legal at the time. From here, the banned press spread throughout Lithuania proper. In 1894, the Sudovian book smugglers, in an effort to mobilize their forces, to obtain and distribute the Lithuanian press on a regular basis, founded the secret in Marijampolė. 

After 123 years Sudovia returned to Lithuanian administration after World War I, the collapse of the Russian Empire and the withdrawal of the occupying German army. In 1918–1919, the southern outskirts with Vištytis and Liubavas were disputed by newly reestablished Poland, with local Poles forming Polish communes, which, however, were forcibly dissolved by Lithuanian forces. 

During World War II, it was occupied by the Soviet Union from 1940, and by Nazi Germany in 1941-1944, when it was part of the Kaunas Regional District. The county was abolished in 1950. 

Marijampolė County was reconstituted in 1994 as an administrative-territorial unit comprising several municipalities. The coat of arms of Marijampolė County was adopted in 2004. On 1 July 2010, the county administration was abolished and its functions were transferred to municipalities and ministries, while the county itself remained a territorial unit. 

== Climate ==
Marijampolė County has a Warm Summer Continental or Hemiboreal climate (Dfb) according to the Köppen climate classification system, which is characterized by warm to hot (and often humid) summers and long and frosty winters. The region is one of the warmest in Lithuania, with the average temperature in July being 18.5 °C (65 °F). The average temperature in a year is 7.5 °C (46 °F).

== Subdivisions ==

Marijampolė County is divided into 5 municipalities which are further divided into 42 elderships (seniūnija). The largest municipality is Šakiai District Municipality, while the most populous is Marijampolė Municipality.

The municipalities are listed in the following table (in alphabetical order).

<doc id="541795" wikidata="Q490513" url="?curid=541795" title="Foreign direct investment">
<text>A foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to purchase of an asset in another country, such that it gives direct control to the purchaser over the asset (e.g. purchase of land and building). In other words, it is an investment in the form of a controlling ownership in a business, in real estate or in productive assets such as factories in one country by an entity based in another country. It is thus distinguished from a foreign portfolio investment or foreign indirect investment by a notion of direct control.

The origin of the investment does not impact the definition, as an FDI: the investment may be made either &quot;inorganically&quot; by buying a company in the target country or &quot;organically&quot; by expanding the operations of an existing business in that country.

==Definitions==
Broadly, foreign direct investment includes mergers and acquisitions, building new facilities, reinvesting profits earned from overseas operations, and intra company loans. In a narrow sense, foreign direct investment refers just to building new facility, and a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. FDI is the sum of equity capital, long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. FDI usually involves participation in management, joint-venture, transfer of technology and expertise. &quot;Stock&quot; of FDI is the &quot;net&quot; (i.e., outward FDI minus inward FDI) cumulative FDI for any given period. Direct investment excludes investment through purchase of shares (if that purchase results in an investor controlling less than 10% of the shares of the company).

FDI, a subset of international factor movements, is characterized by controlling ownership of a business enterprise in one country by an entity based in another country. Foreign direct investment is distinguished from foreign portfolio investment, a passive investment in the securities of another country such as public stocks and bonds, by the element of &quot;control&quot;. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Standard definitions of control use the internationally agreed 10 percent threshold of voting shares, but this is a grey area as often a smaller block of shares will give control in widely held companies. Moreover, control of technology, management, even crucial inputs can confer de facto control.&quot;

==Theoretical background==
Before Stephen Hymer&#x27;s landmark work on FDI in 1960, no theory existed that dealt specifically with FDI. However, there are theories that dealt generally with foreign investments. Both Eli Heckscher (1919) and Bertil Ohlin (1933) developed the theory of foreign investments by using neoclassical economics and macroeconomic theory. Based on this principle, the differences in the costs of production of goods between two countries cause specialisation of jobs and trade between countries. Reasons for differences in costs of production can be explained by factor proportions theory. For example, countries with a greater proportion of labour will engage in labor-intensive industries while countries that have a greater proportion of capital will engage in capital-intensive industries. However, such a theory makes the assumption that there is perfect competition, there is no movement of labour across country borders, and the multinational companies assumes risk neutral preferences. In 1967, Weintraub tested this hypothesis by collecting United States data on rate of return and flow of capital. However, the data failed to support this hypothesis. Data from surveys on the motivation of FDI also failed to support this hypothesis.

Intrigued by the motivations behind large foreign investments made by corporations from the United States of America, Hymer developed a framework that went beyond the existing theories, explaining why this phenomenon occurred, since he considered that the previously mentioned theories could not explain foreign investment and its motivations. Facing the challenges of his predecessors, Hymer focused his theory on filling the gaps regarding international investment. The theory proposed by the author approaches international investment from a different and more firm-specific point of view. As opposed to traditional macroeconomics-based theories of investment, Hymer states that there is a difference between mere capital investment, otherwise known as portfolio investment, and direct investment. The difference between the two, which will become the cornerstone of his whole theoretical framework, is the issue of control, meaning that with direct investment firms are able to obtain a greater level of control than with portfolio investment. Furthermore, Hymer proceeds to criticize the neoclassical theories, stating that the theory of capital movements cannot explain international production. Moreover, he clarifies that FDI is not necessarily a movement of funds from a home country to a host country, and that it is concentrated on particular industries within many countries. In contrast, if interest rates were the main motive for international investment, FDI would include many industries within fewer countries.

Another observation made by Hymer went against what was maintained by the neoclassical theories: foreign direct investment is not limited to investment of excess profits abroad. In fact, foreign direct investment can be financed through loans obtained in the host country, payments in exchange for equity (patents, technology, machinery etc.), and other methods.

The main determinants of FDI is side as well as growth prospectus of the economy of the country when FDI is made. Hymer proposed some more determinants of FDI due to criticisms, along with assuming market and imperfections. These are as follows:

# Firm-specific advantages: Once domestic investment was exhausted, a firm could exploit its advantages linked to market imperfections, which could provide the firm with market power and competitive advantage. Further studies attempted to explain how firms could monetize these advantages in the form of licenses.
# Removal of conflicts: conflict arises if a firm is already operating in foreign market or looking to expand its operations within the same market. He proposes that the solution for this hurdle arose in the form of collusion, sharing the market with rivals or attempting to acquire a direct control of production. However, it must be taken into account that a reduction in conflict through acquisition of control of operations will increase the market imperfections.
# Propensity to formulate an internationalization strategy to mitigate risk: According to his position, firms are characterized with 3 levels of decision making: the day to day supervision, management decision coordination and long-term strategy planning and decision making. The extent to which a company can mitigate risk depends on how well a firm can formulate an internationalization strategy taking these levels of decision into account.

Hymer&#x27;s importance in the field of international business and foreign direct investment stems from him being the first to theorize about the existence of multinational enterprises (MNE) and the reasons behind FDI beyond macroeconomic principles, his influence on later scholars and theories in international business, such as the OLI (&quot;ownership, location and internationalization&quot;) theory by John Dunning and Christos Pitelis which focuses more on transaction costs. Moreover, &quot;the efficiency-value creation component of FDI and MNE activity was further strengthened by two other major scholarly developments in the 1990s: the resource-based (RBV) and evolutionary theories&quot; In addition, some of his predictions later materialized, for example the power of supranational bodies such as IMF or the World Bank that increases inequalities (Dunning &amp; Piletis, 2008). A phenomenon the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 aims to address.

==Types of FDI==
The types of FDI investments can be classified based on the perspective of the investor/source country and host/destination country. On an investor perspective, it can be divided into horizontal FDI, vertical FDI, and conglomerate FDI. In the destination country, the FDI can be divided into import-substituting, export-increasing, and government initiated FDI. Horizontal FDI arises when a multination corporation duplicates its home country industry chain into the destination country to produce similar goods. Vertical FDI takes place when a multinational corporation acquires a company to exploit the natural resources in the destination country (backward vertical FDI) or by acquiring distribution outlets to market its products in the destination country (forward vertical FDI). Conglomerate FDI is the combination between horizontal and vertical FDI.

Platform FDI is the foreign direct investment from a source country into a destination country for the purpose of exporting to a third country.

==Methods==
The foreign direct investor may acquire voting power of an enterprise in an economy through any of the following methods:

* by incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary or company anywhere
* by acquiring shares in an associated enterprise
* through a merger or an acquisition of an unrelated enterprise
* participating in an equity joint venture with another investor or enterprise

===Forms of FDI incentives===
Foreign direct investment incentives may take the following forms:

* low corporate tax and individual income tax rates
* tax holidays
* other types of tax concessions
* preferential tariffs
* special economic zones
* EPZ – export processing zones
* bonded warehouses
* maquiladoras
* investment financial subsidies
* free land or land subsidies
* relocation &amp; expatriation
* infrastructure subsidies
* R&amp;D support
* energy
* derogation from regulations (usually for very large projects)
* Stronger Intellectual Property Rights
==FDI==

Foreign Direct Investment tends to increase with the democracy index of the country for countries where the share of natural resources in total exports is low. For countries with high natural resource export share, the FDI tends to decrease with a higher democracy index.

A 2010 meta-analysis of the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on local firms in developing and transition countries suggests that foreign investment robustly increases local productivity growth.

From 1992 until at least 2023, the United States and China have been the top two destinations for FDI.

=== Europe ===
According to a study conducted by EY, France was in 2020 the largest foreign direct investment recipient in Europe, ahead of the UK and Germany. EY attributed this as a &quot;direct result of President Macron&#x27;s reforms of labor laws and corporate taxation, which were well received by domestic and international investors alike.&quot; Moreover, 24 countries of the EU made an investment into Armenian economy since the year of Armenian Independence.

European scale-ups that achieve significant growth are frequently acquired by foreign entities, with over 60% of these acquisitions involving buyers from outside the EU, predominantly from the United States.

=== China ===

FDI in China, also known as RFDI (renminbi foreign direct investment), largely began in the late 1970s due to the reform and opening-up economic policies of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Foreign direct investment increased considerably in the 2000s, reaching $19.1 billion in the first six months of 2012, making China the largest recipient of foreign direct investment at that point of time and topping the United States which had $17.4 billion of FDI. In 2013 the FDI flow into China was $24.1 billion, resulting in a 34.7% market share of FDI into the Asia-Pacific region. By contrast, FDI out of China in 2013 was $8.97 billion, 10.7% of the Asia-Pacific share. As a result of the Great Recession, FDI fell by over one-third in 2009 but rebounded in 2010. China implemented the Foreign Investment Law in 2020. FDI in China dropped to a 30-year-low in 2024, which was attributed to anti-espionage crackdowns from China and a rise in sanctions for industries like semiconductors.

===India===
Foreign investment was introduced in 1991 under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), driven by then finance minister Manmohan Singh. India disallowed overseas corporate bodies (OCB) to invest in India. India imposes cap on equity holding by foreign investors in various sectors, current FDI in aviation and insurance sectors is limited to a maximum of 49%. In 2015, India emerged as top FDI destination surpassing China and the US. India attracted FDI of $31 billion compared to $28 billion and $27 billion of China and the US respectively.

===Iran===
Iranian companies saw some improvement of FDI investment as of 2015 because of JCPOA. Some investment is much needed in Iranian oil industry. By 2023 due to condition of Iranian economy FDI had decreased by 82%.

===United States===
Broadly speaking, the United States has a fundamentally &quot;open economy&quot; and low barriers to the FDI.

U.S. FDI totaled $194 billion in 2010. Of FDI in the United States in 2010, 84% came from or through eight countries: Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada.

A 2008 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicated that foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if their own countries have less developed financial markets, an effect whose magnitude decreases with income per capita. Countries with fewer capital controls and greater trade with the United States also invest more in U.S. equity and bond markets.

White House data reported in 2011 found that a total of 5.7 million workers were employed at facilities highly dependent on foreign direct investors. Thus, about 13% of the American manufacturing workforce depended on such investments. The average pay of said jobs was found as around $70,000 per worker, over 30% higher than the average pay across the entire U.S. workforce.

President Barack Obama said in 2012, &quot;In a global economy, the United States faces increasing competition for the jobs and industries of the future. Taking steps to ensure that we remain the destination of choice for investors around the world will help us win that competition and bring prosperity to our people.&quot;

In September 2013, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013 (H.R. 2052; 113th Congress), a bill which would direct the United States Department of Commerce to &quot;conduct a review of the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting foreign direct investment&quot;. Supporters of the bill argued that increased foreign direct investment would help job creation in the United States.

=== Eurasia ===
In November 2021, a report from the Eurasian Development Bank revealed that Kazakhstan boasted the highest FDI stock value from the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) with $11.2 billion by 2020 and an increase of over $3 billion since 2017.

=== Armenia ===
According to the World Bank, Armenia takes the first place in terms of FDI appeal among Commonwealth of Independent States. The Armenian government has created a favorable environment for foreign investments by introducing new laws and conditions. The country was named &#x27;The Caucasian Tiger&#x27; because of its dynamic economy. Some of the measures to attract FDI include free economic zones (FEZ) with relaxed laws, also, profit tax, VAT, and property tax benefits. In particular, The Most Favored Nation (MFN) and National Treatment regimes are in effect, and the government has chosen a &quot;open door&quot; policy with ongoing legal protection to encourage international investment. A highly beneficial business environment is guaranteed for international investors under the law &quot;On Foreign Investments.&quot; Additionally, it guarantees the protection of foreign capital invested in Armenian businesses and permits limitless involvement. Research shows that Cyprus, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and France have made an altogether investment in an amount 1.4 USD billion in the period 2007-2013.

=== Latin America ===
This region of the world maintains foreign direct investment with certain peculiarities compared to countries previously shown. Therefore, a topic of in-depth analysis concerns countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Argentina. As Chevillote Delgado mentions in his study, Latin America offers opportunities and is simultaneously within the expansion spectrum for some investors, as currently, Brazil holds an important position, as its growth over a period of 15 years has been fruitful.

Digging deeper, this region of the world is not only the investment space for multinational companies in greater number due to its natural resources, but also because of the population settled here, as it is around 630,089,000 inhabitants. However, the availability of raw materials in large quantities may represent a future weakness, as not all are renewable. The mining and oil industries are on the rise, so in terms of growth percentages, it is important to highlight that thanks to China&#x27;s investment in Latin America, this region has become the backbone for its amenities as expressed in &quot;Foreign Direct Investment in Latin America&quot;.

Despite the wealth of Latin America, there are multiple factors that push investors to think twice about their capital within Latin America, as political instability, violence, and sociocultural factors can represent a much greater challenge.

<text>The military of the Ottoman Empire () was the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire. It was founded in 1299 and dissolved in 1922.

== Army ==
The Military of the Ottoman Empire can be divided in five main periods. The foundation era covers the years between 1300 (Byzantine expedition) and 1453 (Conquest of Constantinople), the classical period covers the years between 1451 (second enthronement of Sultan Mehmed II) and 1606 (Peace of Zsitvatorok), the reformation period covers the years between 1606 and 1826 (Vaka-i Hayriye), the modernisation period covers the years between 1826 and 1858 and decline period covers the years between 1861 (enthronement of Sultan Abdülaziz) and 1918 (Armistice of Mudros). The Ottoman army is the forerunner of the Turkish Armed Forces.

=== Foundation period (1300–1453) ===
The earliest form of the Ottoman military was a steppe-nomadic cavalry force. This was centralized by Osman I from Turkoman tribesmen inhabiting western Anatolia in the late 13th century.

These horsemen became an irregular force of raiders used as shock troops, armed with weapons like bows and spears. They were given fiefs called &quot;timars&quot; in the conquered lands, and were later called timariots. In addition they acquired wealth during campaigns.

Orhan organized a standing army paid by salary rather than looting or fiefs. The infantry were called yayas and the cavalry was known as &quot;müsellem&quot;s. The force was made up by foreign mercenaries for the most part, and only a few Turks were content to accept salaries in place of timars. Foreign mercenaries were not required to convert to Islam as long as they obeyed their Ottoman commanders.

The Ottomans began using guns in the late 14th century. Following that, other troop types began to appear, such as the regular musketeers (&quot;Piyade Topçu&quot;, literally &quot;foot artillery&quot;); regular cavalry armed with firearms (&quot;Süvari Topçu Neferi&quot;, literally &quot;mounted artillery soldier&quot;), similar to the later European reiter or carabinier; and bombardiers (&quot;Humbaracı&quot;), consisting of grenadiers who threw explosives called khımbara and the soldiers who served the artillery with maintenance and powder supplies.

The Ottoman Empire was the first of the three Islamic Gunpowder Empires, followed by Safavid Persia and Mughal India. By the 14th century, the Ottomans had adopted gunpowder artillery. The adoption of the gunpowder weapons by the Ottomans was so rapid that they &quot;preceded both their European and Middle Eastern adversaries in establishing centralized and permanent troops specialized in the manufacturing and handling of firearms.&quot; But it was their use of artillery that shocked their adversaries and impelled the other two Islamic Gunpowder Empires to accelerate their weapons program. The Ottomans had artillery at least by the reign of Bayezid I and used them in the sieges of Constantinople in 1399 and 1402. They finally proved their worth as siege engines in the successful siege of Salonica in 1430.

The Ottoman military&#x27;s regularized use of firearms proceeded ahead of the pace of their European counterparts. The Janissaries had initially been an infantry bodyguard using bows and arrows. By the time of Sultan Mehmed II, they had been drilled with firearms and became &quot;perhaps the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world.&quot; The Janissaries are thus considered the first modern standing armies. The combination of artillery and Janissary firepower proved decisive at Varna in 1444 against a force of Crusaders, and later Başkent and Chaldoran against the Aq Qoyunlu and Safavids.

===Classical Army (1451–1606)===

Ottoman Classical Army was the military structure and the founding and main army established by Mehmed II, during his reorganization of the state and the military efforts. This is the major reorganization following Orhan I which organized a standing army paid by salary rather than booty or fiefs. This army was the force during rise of the Ottoman Empire. The organization was twofold, central (Kapu Kulu) and peripheral (Eyalet). The classical Ottoman army was the most disciplined and feared military force of its time, mainly due to its high level of organization, logistical capabilities and its elite troops. Following a century long reform efforts, this Army was forced to disbandment by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 by what is known as Auspicious Incident. By the reign of Mahmud the second, the elite janissaries had become corrupt and always stood in the way of modernization efforts meaning they were more of a liability than an asset.

By the siege of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottomans had large enough cannons to batter the walls of the city, to the surprise of the defenders. The Dardanelles Gun was designed and cast in bronze in 1464 by Munir Ali. The Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 340 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 casualties from this bombardment.

The musket first appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465. Damascus steel was later used in the production of firearms such as the musket from the 16th century. At the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Janissaries equipped with 2000 muskets &quot;formed 8 consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row,&quot; in a &quot;kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest.&quot; The Chinese attempted to adopted the Ottoman kneeling position for firing. In 1598, Chinese writer Zhao Shizhen described Turkish muskets as being superior to European muskets.

The marching band and military band both have their origins in the Ottoman military band, performed by the Janissary since the 16th century.

=== Reform on Classical Army (1606–1826) ===
The main theme of this period is reforming the Janissaries. The Janissary corps were originally made up of enslaved young Christian boys, generally from the western Balkans, who were forced to convert to Islam and were educated in military matters under the Ottoman Empire. During the 15th and 16th Centuries they became known as the most efficient and effective military unit in Europe. By 1570 born Muslims were accepted into the Janissaries corps and by the 17th century most would be born Muslims. According to Jason Goodwin in the 17th and 18th centuries most Janissaries were Muslim Albanians.

Aside from the Janissary infantry, there was also the Sipahi Cavalry. They were, however, different from the Janissaries in that they had both military and administrative duties. The Janissaries were tied strictly to being able to perform military duties at any time, however the Sipahi were treated differently primarily in that they got their income from the land that was given to them from the Sultan under the timariot system. Within these agricultural lands, the Sipahi were in charge of collecting the taxes which would serve as their salary. At the same time they were responsible for maintaining peace and order there. They were also expected to be able to serve in the military whenever the Sultan deemed their service necessary.

In 1621, the Chinese &quot;Wu Pei Chih&quot; described Ottoman muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in any European or Chinese firearms at the time.

The Ottoman Empire made numerous efforts to recruit French experts for its modernization. The French officer and adventurer Claude-Alexandre de Bonneval (1675–1747) went in the service of Sultan Mahmud I, converted to Islam, and endeavoured to modernize the Ottoman army, creating cannon foundries, powder and musket factories and a military engineering school. Another officer François Baron de Tott was involved in the reform efforts for the Ottoman military. He succeeded in having a new foundry built to make howitzers, and was instrumental in the creation of mobile artillery units. He built fortifications on the Bosphorus and started a naval science course that laid the foundation stone for the later Turkish Naval Academy.
He could only achieve limited success, however. Unfortunately it was almost impossible for him to divert soldiers from the regular army into the new units. The new ships and guns that made it into service were too few to have much of an influence on the Ottoman army and de Tott returned home.

When they had requested French help in 1795, young Napoleon Bonaparte was scheduled to be sent to Constantinople to help organize Ottoman artillery. He did not go, for just days before he was to embark for the Near East he proved himself useful to the Directory by putting down a Parisian mob at &quot;13 Vendémiaire&quot; and was kept in France.

The supply of Ottoman forces operating in Moldavia and Wallachia was a major challenge that required well organized logistics. An army of 60,000 soldiers and 40,000 horses required a half-million kilograms of food per day. The Ottoman forces fared better than the Russians, but the expenses crippled both national treasuries. Supplies on both sides came using fixed prices, taxes, and confiscation.

Sultan Selim III in 1789 to 1807 set up the &quot;Nizam-i Cedid&quot; [new order] army to replace the inefficient and outmoded imperial army. The old system depended on Janissaries, who had largely lost their military effectiveness. Selim closely followed Western military forms. It would be expensive for a new army, so a new treasury [&#x27;Irad-i Cedid&#x27;] was established . The result was the Porte now had an efficient, European-trained army equipped with modern weapons. However it had fewer than 10,000 soldiers in an era when Western armies were ten to fifty times larger. Furthermore, the Sultan was upsetting the well-established traditional political powers. As a result, it was rarely used, apart from its use against Napoleon&#x27;s expeditionary force at Gaza and Rosetta. The new army was dissolved by reactionary elements with the overthrow of Selim in 1807, but it became the model of the new Ottoman Army created later in the 19th century.

=== Efforts for a new system (1826–1858) ===

The main theme of this period is disbanding the Janissary, which happened in 1826, and changing the military culture. The major event is &quot;Vaka-ı Hayriye&quot; translated as Auspicious Incident. The military units formed were used in the Crimean War, Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), and Greco-Turkish War (1897).

The failed efforts of a new system dates before 1826. Sultan Selim III formed the Nizam-ı Cedid army (Nizam-ı Cedid meaning New Order) in the late 18th century and early 19th century. This was the first serious attempt to transform the Ottoman military forces into a modern army. However, the Nizam-ı Cedid was short lived, dissolving after the abdication of Selim III in 1807.

Sultan Mahmud II, Selim III&#x27;s successor and nephew, who was a great reformer, disbanded the Janissaries in 1826 with so-called known as &quot;Vaka-ı Hayriye&quot; (the auspicious incident).

The Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye was established, as a contemporary modern army.

Egypt, as part of the empire, also underwent drastic military changes during Muhammad Ali Pasha&#x27;s reign. The two largest military reforms were the effective practices of indoctrination and surveillance, which dramatically changed the way the military was both conducted by the leadership and also perceived by the rest of society. New military law codes resulted in isolation, extreme surveillance, and severe punishments to enforce obedience. The Pasha&#x27;s goal was to create a high regard for the law and strict obedience stemming from sincere want. This shift from direct control by bodily punishment to indirect control through strict law enforcement aimed to make the soldiers&#x27; lives predictable, thus creating a more manageable military for the Pasha.

=== Modern Army (1861–1918) ===

The main theme of this period is organizing and training the newly formed units. The change of French system to German system occurred as the German military mission was most effective during the period. The military units formed were used in the Balkan Wars and World War I.

The shift from Classical Army (1451–1606) took more than a century beginning from failed attempts of Selim III (1789) to a period of Ottoman military reforms (1826–1858) and finally Abdulhamid II. Abdulhamid II, as early as 1880 sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohler. However. Although the consensus that Abdulhamid favored the modernization of the Ottoman army and the professionalization of the officer corps was fairly general, it seems that he neglected the military during the last fifteen years of his reign, and he also cut down the military budget. The formation of Ottoman Modern Army was a slow process with ups and downs.


==Navy==

The Ottoman Navy, also known as the Ottoman Fleet, was established in the early 14th century after the empire first expanded to reach the sea in 1323 by capturing Karamürsel, the site of the first Ottoman naval shipyard and the nucleus of the future Navy. During its long existence, it was involved in many conflicts and signed a number of maritime treaties. At its height, the Navy extended to the Indian Ocean, sending an expedition to Indonesia in 1565.

For much of its history, the Navy was led by the position of the Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral; literally &quot;Captain Pasha&quot;). This position was abolished in 1867, when it was replaced by the Minister of the Navy () and a number of Fleet Commanders ().

After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the Navy&#x27;s tradition was continued under the Turkish Naval Forces of the Republic of Turkey in 1923.

== Aviation ==

The Ottoman Aviation Squadrons were military aviation units of the Ottoman Army and Navy. The history of Ottoman military aviation dates back to June 1909 or July 1911 depending if active duty assignment is accepted as the establishment. The organisation is sometimes referred to as the Ottoman Air Force. According to Edward J. Erickson, the very term Ottoman Air Force is a gross exaggeration and the term Osmanlı Hava Kuvvetleri (Ottoman Air Force) unfortunately is often repeated in contemporary Turkish sources. The fleet size reached its greatest in December 1916, when the Ottoman aviation squadrons had 90 airplanes. The Aviation Squadrons were reorganized as the &quot;General Inspectorate of Air Forces&quot; (&quot;Kuva-yı Havaiye Müfettiş-i Umumiliği&quot;) on 29 July 1918. With the signing of the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, the Ottoman military aviation effectively came to an end. At the time of the armistice, the Ottoman military aviation had around 100 pilots; 17 land-based airplane companies (4 planes each); and 3 seaplane companies (4 planes each); totalling 80 aircraft.

== Personnel ==
=== Recruitment ===

In 1389 the Ottomans introduced a system of military conscription. In times of need every town, quarter, and village had the duty to present a fully equipped conscript at the recruiting office. The new force of irregular infantrymen, called &quot;Azabs&quot;, was used in a number of different ways. They supported the supplies to the front-line, they dug roads and built bridges. On rare occasions they were used as cannon fodder to slow down an enemy advance. A branch of the Azabs were the bashi-bazouk (başıbozuk). These specialized in close combat and were sometimes mounted. Recruited from the homeless, vagrants and criminals, they became notorious for their undisciplined brutality.

=== Training ===

==== Ottoman Military College ====
The Ottoman Military College in Istanbul was the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s two-year military staff college, which aimed to educate staff officers for the Ottoman Army.

==== Ottoman Military Academy ====
Marshal Ahmed Fevzi Pasha together with Mehmed Namık Pasha formed the academy in 1834 as the Mekteb-i Harbiye (Ottoman Turkish: lit. &quot;War School&quot;), and the first class of officers graduated in 1841. This foundation occurred in the context of military reforms within the Ottoman Empire, which recognized the need for more educated officers to modernize its army. The need for a new military order was part of the reforms of Sultan Mahmud II (), continued by his son Sultan Abdulmejid I ().

After the demise of the Ottoman Empire the school renamed itself as Turkish Military Academy under the Republic of Turkey

==== Imperial Naval Engineering School ====
The origin of the Naval Academy goes back to 1773, when Sultan Mustafa III&#x27;s Grand Vizier and Admiral Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha founded a naval school under the name of &quot;Naval Engineering at Golden Horn Naval Shipyard&quot;. François Baron de Tott, a French officer and advisor to the Ottoman military, was appointed for the establishment of a course to provide education on plane geometry and navigation. The course, attended also by civilian captains of the merchant marine, took place on board a galleon anchored at Kasimpaşa in Istanbul and lasted three months. The temporary course turned into a continuous education on land with the establishment of &quot;Naval Mathematical College&quot; in February 1776. With growing numbers of cadets, the college building at the naval shipyard was extended. On 22 October 1784 the college, renamed the &quot;Imperial Naval Engineering School&quot; (), started its three-year education courses in the new building. From 1795 on, the training was divided into navigation and cartography for officers of the deck, and naval architecture and shipbuilding for naval engineers. In 1838 the naval school moved into its new building in Kasımpaşa. With the beginning (1839) of the reformation efforts, the school was renamed &quot;Naval School&quot; () and continued to operate in Kasımpaşa for 12 years. Then it was relocated in 1850 to Heybeliada for the last time. During the Second Constitutional Era, an upgraded education system was adapted in 1909 from the Royal Naval Academy.

After the demise of the Ottoman Empire the school renamed itself as Naval Academy (Turkey) under the Republic of Turkey

=== Ranks ===
==== Classic Army ====
* Aghas commanded the different branches of the military services, for example: &quot;azap agha&quot;, &quot;besli agha&quot;, &quot;janissary agha&quot;, for the commanders of azaps, beslis, and janissaries, respectively. This designation was given to commanders of smaller military units, too, for instance the &quot;bölük agha&quot;, and the &quot;ocak agha&quot;, the commanders of a &quot;bölük&quot; (company) and an &quot;ocak&quot; (troop) respectively.
* Boluk-bashi was a commander of a &quot;bölük&quot;, equivalent to the rank of captain.
* Çorbacı (Turkish for &quot;soup server&quot;) was a commander of an orta (regiment), approximately corresponding to the rank of colonel () today. In seafaring, the term was in use for the boss of a ship&#x27;s crew, a role similar to that of boatswain.

==== Modern army ====

The system of ranks and insignia followed the patterns of the German Empire.
* Nefer (Private)
* Onbaşı (Corporal)
* Çavuş (Sergeant)
* Başçavuş (Sergeant major)
* Mülazım-ı Sani (Second lieutenant)
* Mülazım-ı Evvel (First lieutenant)
* Yüzbaşı (Captain)
* Kolağası (Senior Captain or Adjutant Major)
* Binbaşı (Major)
* Kaymakam (Lieutenant colonel)

==Awards and decorations==
The Ottoman War Medal, better known as the Gallipoli Star, was instituted by the Sultan Mehmed Reshad V on 1 March 1915 for gallantry in battle. The Iftikhar Sanayi Medal was first granted by Sultan Abdulhamid II. Order of the Medjidie was instituted in 1851 by Sultan Abdülmecid I. The Order of Osmanieh was created in January 1862 by Sultan Abdulaziz. This became the second highest order with the obsolescence of the Nişan-i Iftikhar. The Order of Osmanieh ranks below the Nişan-i Imtiyaz.

<text>Šiauliai County () is one of ten counties in Lithuania. It is in the north of the country, and its capital is Šiauliai. On 1 July 2010, the county administration was abolished, and since that date, Šiauliai County remains as the territorial and statistical unit. It borders Latvia.

== History ==
Formation of administrative regions in Lithuania started in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Middle Ages, with the bulk of the territory of the current Šiauliai County forming part of the Duchy of Samogitia, itself divided into tracts.

In October 1795, Catherine II of Russia granted Šiauliai the city rights and the privilege to become the capital town of the region. Administrative division of Russian Empire remained unchanged up to the end of World War I. When the war came to its end, in 1918 Lithuania was restored as an independent state.

On December 17, 1918, a circular No.1 was issued &quot;On Municipalities in Lithuania&quot; that declared that the entire area of Lithuania would be divided into the regions - apskritys (county sometimes translated into English as a provinces or counties). There were ten apskritys in Lithuania.

In 1937, Siauliai county&#x27;s overall territory was 6042 km2 and 210 thousands people lived there. It was the largest apskritis in Lithuania.

In 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and reformed the administrative system. The county system remained until 1950 when the counties were abolished and entire area was divided into smaller units - districts, or rajonas in Lithuanian.

Only in 1994 - four years after the restoration of Lithuania&#x27;s independence in 1990 - the apskritys were created again. However, the interwar apskritys should not be mixed with current apskritys, as their purpose, sizes, and number are all different, see administrative division of Lithuania. The entire area of Lithuania is currently divided into ten larger units - apskritys and smaller districts, consisting of urban and rural elderships.

<doc id="541808" wikidata="Q842623" url="?curid=541808" title="Paddy field">
<text>A paddy field is a flooded field of arable land used for growing semiaquatic crops, most notably rice and taro. It originates from the Neolithic rice-farming cultures of the Yangtze River basin in southern China, associated with pre-Austronesian and Hmong-Mien cultures. It was spread in prehistoric times by the expansion of Austronesian peoples to Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. The technology was also acquired by other cultures in mainland Asia for rice farming, spreading to East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and South Asia.

Fields can be built into steep hillsides as terraces or adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They require a great deal of labor and materials to create and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Oxen and water buffalo, adapted for life in wetlands, are important working animals used extensively in paddy field farming.

Paddy field farming remains the dominant form of growing rice in modern times. It is practiced extensively in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, northern Iran, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. It has also been introduced elsewhere since the colonial era, notably in northern Italy, the Camargue in France, and in Spain, particularly in the Albufera de València wetlands in the Valencian Community, the Ebro Delta in Catalonia and the Guadalquivir wetlands in Andalusia, as well as along the eastern coast of Brazil, the Artibonite Valley in Haiti, Sacramento Valley in California, and West Lothian in Scotland among other places.

Paddy cultivation should not be confused with cultivation of deepwater rice, which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50 cm (20 in) deep for at least a month. Global paddies&#x27; emissions account for at least 10% of global methane emissions. Drip irrigation systems have been proposed as a possible environmental and commercial solution.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;paddy&quot; is derived from the Malay/Indonesian word &quot;padi&quot;, meaning &quot;rice plant&quot;, which is itself derived from Proto-Austronesian *pajay (&quot;rice in the field&quot;, &quot;rice plant&quot;). Cognates include Amis &quot;panay&quot;; Tagalog &quot;pálay&quot;; Kadazan Dusun &quot;paai&quot;; Javanese &quot;pari&quot;; and Chamorro &quot;fai&quot;, among others.

== History ==

===Neolithic southern China===

Genetic evidence shows that all forms of paddy rice, including both &quot;indica&quot; and &quot;japonica&quot;, spring from a domestication of the wild rice &quot;Oryza rufipogon&quot; by cultures associated with pre-Austronesian and Hmong-Mien-speakers. This occurred 13,500 to 8,200 years ago south of the Yangtze River in present-day China.
There are two likely centers of domestication for rice as well as the development of the wet-field technology. The first is in the lower Yangtze River, believed to be the homelands of the pre-Austronesians and possibly also the Kra-Dai, and associated with the Kuahuqiao, Hemudu, Majiabang, Songze, Liangzhu, and Maquiao cultures. The second is in the middle Yangtze River, believed to be the homelands of the early Hmong-Mien speakers and associated with the Pengtoushan, Nanmuyuan, Liulinxi, Daxi, Qujialing, and Shijiahe cultures. Both of these regions were heavily populated and had regular trade contacts with each other, as well as with early Austroasiatic speakers to the west, and early Kra-Dai speakers to the south, facilitating the spread of rice cultivation throughout southern China.
The earliest paddy field found dates to 4330 BC, based on carbon dating of grains of rice and soil organic matter found at the Chaodun site in Kunshan. At Caoxieshan, a site of the Neolithic Majiabang culture, archaeologists excavated paddy fields. Some archaeologists claim that Caoxieshan may date to 4000–3000 BC. There is archaeological evidence that unhusked rice was stored for the military and for burial with the deceased from the Neolithic period to the Han dynasty in China.

By the late Neolithic (3500 to 2500 BC), population in the rice cultivating centers had increased rapidly, centered around the Qujialing-Shijiahe and Liangzhu cultures. There was also evidence of intensive rice cultivation in paddy fields as well as increasingly sophisticated material cultures in these two regions. The number of settlements among the Yangtze cultures and their sizes increased, leading some archeologists to characterize them as true states, with clearly advanced socio-political structures. However, it is unknown if they had centralized control.

In the terminal Neolithic (2500 to 2000 BC), Shijiahe shrank in size, and Liangzhu disappeared altogether. This is largely believed to be the result of the southward expansion of the early Sino-Tibetan Longshan culture. Fortifications like walls (as well as extensive moats in Liangzhu cities) are common features in settlements during this period, indicating widespread conflict. This period also coincides with the southward movement of rice-farming cultures to the Lingnan and Fujian regions, as well as the southward migrations of the Austronesian, Kra-Dai, and Austroasiatic-speaking peoples to Mainland Southeast Asia and Island Southeast Asia.

===Austronesian expansion===
The spread of &quot;japonica&quot; rice cultivation and paddy field agriculture to Southeast Asia started with the migrations of the Austronesian Dapenkeng culture into Taiwan between 3500 and 2000 BC. The Nanguanli site in Taiwan, dated to ca. 2800 BC, has yielded numerous carbonized remains of both rice and millet in waterlogged conditions, indicating intensive wetland rice cultivation and dryland millet cultivation.

From about 2000 to 1500 BC, the Austronesian expansion began, with settlers from Taiwan moving south to migrate to Luzon in the Philippines, bringing rice cultivation technologies with them. From Luzon, Austronesians rapidly colonized the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia, moving westwards to Borneo, the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra; and southwards to Sulawesi and Java. By 500 BC, there is evidence of intensive wetland rice agriculture already established in Java and Bali, especially near very fertile volcanic islands.

Rice did not survive the Austronesian voyages into Micronesia and Polynesia; however, wet-field agriculture was transferred to the cultivation of other crops, most notably for taro cultivation. The Austronesian Lapita culture also came into contact with the non-Austronesian (Papuan) early agriculturists of New Guinea and introduced wetland farming techniques to them. In turn, they assimilated their range of indigenous cultivated fruits and tubers before spreading further eastward to Island Melanesia and Polynesia. In Hawaii, the conditions of available taro pondfields (&quot;loʻi&quot;) as worked by native Hawaiians later proved feasible for rice cultivation by Chinese and Japanese migrant farmers in the late 19th to early 20th century; rice plots were often enlargened by dismantling bunds (&quot;kuāuna&quot;) that bordered between smaller established &quot;loʻi&quot;.

Rice and wet-field agriculture were also introduced to Madagascar, the Comoros, and the coast of East Africa around the 1st millennium AD by Austronesian settlers from the Greater Sunda Islands.

=== Korea===
There are ten archaeologically excavated rice paddy fields in Korea. The two oldest are the Okhyun and Yaumdong sites, found in Ulsan, dating to the early Mumun pottery period.

Paddy field farming goes back thousands of years in Korea. A pit-house at the Daecheon-ni site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates, indicating that rice cultivation in dry-fields may have begun as early as the Middle Jeulmun pottery period (c. 3500–2000 BC) in the Korean Peninsula. Ancient paddy fields have been carefully unearthed in Korea by institutes such as Kyungnam University Museum (KUM) of Masan. They excavated paddy field features at the Geumcheon-ni Site near Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province. The paddy field feature was found next to a pit-house that is dated to the latter part of the Early Mumun pottery period (c. 1100–850 BC). KUM has conducted excavations, that have revealed similarly dated paddy field features, at Yaeum-dong and Okhyeon, in modern-day Ulsan.

The earliest Mumun features were usually located in low-lying narrow gullies, that were naturally swampy and fed by the local stream system. Some Mumun paddy fields in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles, separated by bunds approximately 10 cm in height, while terraced paddy fields consisted of long irregular shapes that followed natural contours of the land at various levels.

Mumun Period rice farmers used all of the elements that are present in today&#x27;s paddy fields, such as terracing, bunds, canals, and small reservoirs. We can grasp some paddy-field farming techniques of the Middle Mumun (c. 850–550 BC), from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice fields at the Majeon-ni Site. However, iron tools for paddy-field farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC. The spatial scale of paddy-fields increased, with the regular use of iron tools, in the Three Kingdoms of Korea Period (c. AD 300/400-668).

===Japan===
The first paddy fields in Japan date to the Early Yayoi period (300 BC – 250 AD). The Early Yayoi has been re-dated, and based on studies of early Japanese paddy formations in Kyushu it appears that wet-field rice agriculture in Japan was directly adopted from the Lower Yangtze river basin in Eastern China.

== Culture ==
=== China ===

Although China&#x27;s agricultural output is the largest in the world, only about 15% of its total land area can be cultivated. About 75% of the cultivated area is used for food crops. Rice is China&#x27;s most important crop, raised on about 25% of the cultivated area. Most rice is grown south of the Huai River, in the Yangtze valley, the Zhu Jiang delta, and in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces.

Rice appears to have been used by the Early Neolithic populations of Lijiacun and Yunchanyan in China. Evidence of possible rice cultivation from ca. 11,500 BC has been found, however it is still questioned whether the rice was indeed being cultivated, or instead being gathered as wild rice. Bruce Smith, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who has written on the origins of agriculture, says that evidence has been mounting that the Yangtze was probably the site of the earliest rice cultivation. In 1998, Crawford &amp; Shen reported that the earliest of 14 AMS or radiocarbon dates on rice from at least nine Early to Middle Neolithic sites is no older than 7000 BC, that rice from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao sites indicates that rice domestication likely began before 5000 BC, but that most sites in China from which rice remains have been recovered are younger than 5000 BC.

During the Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), two revolutionary improvements in farming technology took place. One was the use of cast iron tools and beasts of burden to pull plows, and the other was the large-scale harnessing of rivers and development of water conservation projects. Sunshu Ao of the 6th century BC and Ximen Bao of the 5th century BC are two of the earliest hydraulic engineers from China, and their works were focused upon improving irrigation systems. These developments were widely spread during the ensuing Warring States period (403–221 BC), culminating in the enormous Du Jiang Yan Irrigation System engineered by Li Bing by 256 BC for the State of Qin in ancient Sichuan. During the Eastern Jin (317–420) and the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420–589), land-use became more intensive and efficient, rice was grown twice a year and cattle began to be used for plowing and fertilization.

By about 750, 75% of China&#x27;s population lived north of the Yangtze, but by 1250, 75% of China&#x27;s population lived south of it. Such large-scale internal migration was possible due to introduction of quick-ripening strains of rice from Vietnam suitable for multi-cropping.

Famous rice paddies in China include the Longsheng Rice Terraces and the fields of Yuanyang County, Yunnan.

=== India ===

India has the largest paddy output in the world and is also the largest exporter of rice in the world as of 2020. In India, West Bengal is the largest rice producing state. Paddy fields are a common sight throughout India, both in the northern Gangetic Plains and the southern peninsular plateaus. Paddy is cultivated at least twice a year in most parts of India, the two seasons being known as Rabi and Kharif respectively. The former cultivation is dependent on irrigation, while the latter depends on the Monsoon. The paddy cultivation plays a major role in socio-cultural life of rural India. Many regional festivals celebrate the harvest, such as Onam, Bihu, Thai Pongal, Makar Sankranti, and Nabanna. The Kaveri delta region of Thanjavur is historically known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu, and Kuttanadu is called the rice bowl of Kerala. Gangavathi is known as the rice bowl of Karnataka.

=== Indonesia ===
Prime Javanese paddies yield roughly 6 metric tons of unmilled rice (2.5 metric tons of milled rice) per hectare. When irrigation is available, rice farmers typically plant Green Revolution rice varieties allowing three growing seasons per year. Since fertilizer and pesticide are relatively expensive inputs, farmers typically plant seeds in a very small plot. Three weeks following germination, the 15-20 centimetre (6–8 in) stalks are picked and replanted at greater separation, in a backbreaking manual procedure.

Rice harvesting in Central Java is often performed not by owners or sharecroppers of paddies, but rather by itinerant middlemen, whose small firms specialize in the harvest, transport, milling, and distribution of rice.

The fertile volcanic soil of much of the Indonesian archipelago—particularly the islands of Java and Bali—has made rice a central dietary staple. Steep terrain on Bali resulted in complex irrigation systems, locally called &quot;subak&quot;, to manage water storage and drainage for rice terraces.

=== Italy ===

Rice is grown in Northern Italy, especially in the valley of the Po River. The paddy fields are irrigated by fast-flowing streams descending from the Alps. In the 19th century and much of the 20th century, the paddy fields were farmed by the &quot;mondine&quot;, a subculture of seasonal rice paddy workers composed mostly of poor women.

=== Japan ===

The acidic soil conditions common in Japan due to volcanic eruptions have made the paddy field the most productive farming method. Paddy fields are represented by the kanji (commonly read as &quot;ta&quot; or as &quot;den&quot;) that has had a strong influence on Japanese culture. In fact, the character , which originally meant &#x27;field&#x27; in general, is used in Japan exclusively to refer to paddy fields. One of the oldest samples of writing in Japan is widely credited to the kanji found on pottery at the archaeological site of Matsutaka in Mie Prefecture that dates to the late 2nd century.

&quot;Ta&quot; () is used as a part of many place names as well as in many family names. Most of these places are somehow related to the paddy field and, in many cases, are based on the history of a particular location. For example, where a river runs through a village, the place east of the river may be called &quot;Higashida&quot; (), literally &quot;east paddy field.&quot; A place with a newly irrigated paddy field, especially those made during or after the Edo period, may be called &quot;Nitta&quot; or &quot;Shinden&quot; (both ), &quot;new paddy field.&quot; In some places, lakes and marshes were likened to a paddy field and were named with &quot;ta&quot;, like &quot;Hakkōda&quot; ().

Today, many family names have &quot;ta&quot; as a component, a practice which can be largely attributed to a government edict in the early Meiji Period which required all citizens to have a family name. Many chose a name based on some geographical feature associated with their residence or occupation, and as nearly three-fourths of the population were farmers, many made family names using &quot;ta&quot;. Some common examples are &quot;Tanaka&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;in the paddy field;&quot; &quot;Nakata&quot; (), &quot;middle paddy field;&quot; &quot;Kawada&quot; (川田), &quot;river paddy field;&quot; and &quot;Furuta&quot; (), &quot;old paddy field.&quot;

In recent years, rice consumption in Japan has fallen and many rice farmers are increasingly elderly. The government has subsidized rice production since the 1970s, and favors protectionist policies regarding cheaper imported rice.

=== Korea ===

Arable land in small alluvial flats of most rural river valleys in South Korea are dedicated to paddy-field farming. Farmers assess paddy fields for any necessary repairs in February. Fields may be rebuilt, and bund breaches are repaired. This work is carried out until mid-March, when warmer spring weather allows the farmer to buy or grow rice seedlings. They are transplanted (usually by rice transplanter) from the indoors into freshly flooded paddy fields in May. Farmers tend and weed their paddy fields through the summer until around the time of Chuseok, a traditional holiday held on 15 August of the Lunar Calendar (circa mid-September on the Solar Calendar). The harvest begins in October. Coordinating the harvest can be challenging because many Korean farmers have small paddy fields in a number of locations around their villages, and modern harvesting machines are sometimes shared between extended family members. Farmers usually dry the harvested grains in the sun before bringing them to market.

The Hanja character for &#x27;field&#x27;, &quot;jeon&quot; (), is found in some place names, especially small farming townships and villages. However, the specific Korean term for &#x27;paddy&#x27; is a purely Korean word, &quot;non&quot; ().

=== Madagascar ===

In Madagascar, the average annual consumption of rice is 130 kg per person, one of the largest in the world.

According to a 1999 study of UPDRS / FAO:

The majority of rice is related to irrigation (1,054,381 ha). The choice of methods conditioning performance is determined by the variety and quality control of water.

The &quot;tavy&quot; is traditionally the culture of flooded upland rice on burning of cleared natural rain forest (135,966 ha). Criticized as being the cause of deforestation, &quot;tavy&quot; is still widely practiced by farmers in Madagascar, who find a good compromise between climate risks, availability of labour and food security.

By extension, the &quot;tanety&quot;, which literally means &quot;hill,&quot; is also growing upland rice, carried out on the grassy slopes that have been deforested for the production of charcoal (139,337 ha).

Among the many varieties, rice of Madagascar includes: &quot;Vary lava&quot; - a translucent long and large grain rice, considered a luxury rice; &quot;Vary Makalioka&quot; - a translucent long and thin grain rice; &quot;Vary Rojofotsy&quot; - a half-long grain rice; and &quot;Vary mena&quot;, or red rice, exclusive to Madagascar.

=== Malaysia ===

Paddy fields can be found in most states on the Malaysian Peninsula, with most of the fields being located in the northern states such as Kedah, Perlis, Perak, and Penang. Paddy fields can also be found on Malaysia&#x27;s east coast region, in Kelantan and Terengganu. The central state of Selangor also has its fair share of paddy fields, especially in the districts of Kuala Selangor and Sabak Bernam.

Before Malaysia became heavily reliant on its industrial output, people were mainly involved in agriculture, especially in the production of rice. It was for that reason, that people usually built their houses next to paddy fields. The very spicy chili pepper that is often eaten in Malaysia, the bird&#x27;s eye chili, is locally called &quot;cili padi&quot;, literally &quot;paddy chili&quot;. Some research pertaining to Rainfed lowland rice in Sarawak has been reported.

=== Myanmar ===

Rice is grown in Myanmar primarily in three areas – the Irrawaddy Delta, the area along and the delta of the Kaladan River, and the Central plains around Mandalay, though there has been an increase in rice farming in Shan State and Kachin State in recent years. Up until the later 1960s, Myanmar was the main exporter of rice. Termed the rice basket of Southeast Asia, much of the rice grown in Myanmar does not rely on fertilizers and pesticides, thus, although &quot;organic&quot; in a sense, it has been unable to cope with population growth and other rice economies which utilized fertilizers.

Rice is now grown in all the three seasons of Myanmar, though primarily in the Monsoon season – from June to October. Rice grown in the delta areas relies heavily on the river water and sedimented minerals from the northern mountains, whilst the rice grown in the central regions require irrigation from the Irrawaddy River.

The fields are tilled when the first rains arrive – traditionally measured at 40 days after Thingyan, the Burmese New Year – around the beginning of June. In modern times, tractors are used, but traditionally, buffalos were employed. The rice plants are planted in nurseries and then transplanted by hand into the prepared fields. The rice is then harvested in late November – &quot;when the rice bends with age&quot;. Most of the rice planting and harvesting is done by hand. The rice is then threshed and stored, ready for the mills.

=== Nepal ===

In Nepal, rice (Nepali: धान, Dhaan) is grown in the Terai and hilly regions. It is mainly grown during the summer monsoon in Nepal.

=== Philippines ===
Paddy fields are a common sight in the Philippines. Several vast paddy fields exist in the provinces of Ifugao, Nueva Ecija, Isabela, Cagayan, Bulacan, Quezon, and other provinces. Nueva Ecija is considered the main rice growing province of the Philippines.

The Banaue Rice Terraces are an example of paddy fields in the country. They are located in Banaue in Northern Luzon, Philippines and were built by the Ifugaos 2,000 years ago. Streams and springs found in the mountains were tapped and channeled into irrigation canals that run downhill through the rice terraces. Other notable Philippine paddy fields are the Batad Rice Terraces, the Bangaan Rice Terraces, the Mayoyao Rice Terraces and the Hapao Rice Terraces.

Located at Barangay Batad in Banaue, the Batad Rice Terraces are shaped like an amphitheatre, and can be reached by a 12-kilometer ride from Banaue Hotel and a 2-hour hike uphill through mountain trails. The Bangaan Rice Terraces portray the typical Ifugao community, where the livelihood activities are within the village and its surroundings. The Bangaan Rice Terraces are accessible by a one-hour ride from Poblacion, Banaue, then a 20-minute trek down to the village. It can be viewed best from the road to Mayoyao. The Mayoyao Rice Terraces are located at Mayoyao, 44 kilometers away from Poblacion, Banaue. The town of Mayoyao lies in the midst of these rice terraces. All dikes are tiered with flat stones. The Hapao Rice Terraces are within 55 kilometers from the capital town of Lagawe. Other Ifugao stone-walled rice terraces are located in the municipality of Hungduan.

=== Sri Lanka ===

Sri Lankan paddy cultivation history dates back to more than 2000 years ago. The historical reports say that Sri Lanka is regarded as the &quot;paddy store of the east&quot; because it produced an excessive quantity of rice. Paddy cultivation can be found all over the island and a considerable amount of land is allocated for it. Both upcountry and low country wetlands use paddy cultivation. The majority of paddy land is in the dry zone, and it uses special irrigation systems for cultivation. The water storing tank called &quot;Wewa&quot; facilitates a supply of water to paddy lands in the cultivation period. Agriculture in Sri Lanka mainly depends on rice production. Sri Lanka sometimes exports rice to its neighboring countries. Around 1.5 million hectares of land are cultivated in Sri Lanka for paddy in 2008/2009 maha: 64% of which is cultivated during the dry season and 35% cultivated during the wet season. Around 879,000 farmer families are engaged in paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka. They make up 20% of the country&#x27;s population and 32% of the employment.

=== Thailand ===

Rice production in Thailand represents a significant portion of the Thai economy. It uses over half of the farmable land area and labor force in Thailand.

Thailand has a strong tradition of rice production. It has the fifth-largest amount of land used for rice cultivation in the world and is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of rice. Thailand has plans to further increase its land available for rice production, with a goal of adding 500,000 hectares to the 9.2 million hectares of rice-growing areas already cultivated. The Thai Ministry of Agriculture expected rice production to yield around 30 million tons of rice for 2008. The most produced strain of rice in Thailand is jasmine rice, which has a significantly lower yield rate than other types of rice, but also normally fetches more than double the price of other strains in a global market.

=== Vietnam ===
Rice fields in Vietnam (&quot;ruộng&quot; or &quot;cánh đồng&quot; in Vietnamese) are the predominant land use in the valley of the Red River and the Mekong Delta. In the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam, control of seasonal river flooding is achieved by an extensive network of dykes which over the centuries total some 3000 km. In the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam, there is an interlacing drainage and irrigation canal system that has become the symbol of this area. The canals additionally serve as transportation routes, allowing farmers to bring their produce to market. In Northwestern Vietnam, Thai people built their &quot;valley culture&quot; based on the cultivation of glutinous rice planted in upland fields, requiring terracing of the slopes.

The primary festival related to the agrarian cycle is &quot;lễ hạ điền&quot; (literally &quot;descent into the fields&quot;) held as the start of the planting season in hope of a bountiful harvest. Traditionally, the event was officiated with much pomp. The monarch carried out the ritual plowing of the first furrow while local dignitaries and farmers followed suit. &quot;Thổ địa&quot; (deities of the earth), &quot;thành hoàng làng&quot; (the village patron spirit), Thần Nông (god of agriculture), and &quot;thần lúa&quot; (god of rice plants) were all venerated with prayers and offerings.

In colloquial Vietnamese, wealth is frequently associated with the vastness of the individual&#x27;s land holdings. Paddy fields so large as for &quot;storks to fly with their wings out-stretched&quot; (&quot;đồng lúa thẳng cánh cò bay&quot;) can be heard as a common metaphor. Wind-blown undulating rice plants across a paddy field in literary Vietnamese is termed figuratively &quot;waves of rice plants&quot; (&quot;sóng lúa&quot;).

== Ecology ==
Paddy fields are a major source of atmospheric methane which contributes to global warming, having been estimated to contribute in the range of 50 to 100 million tonnes of the gas per annum. Studies have shown that this can be significantly reduced while also boosting crop yield by draining the paddies to allow the soil to aerate to interrupt methane production. Studies have also shown the variability in assessment of methane emission using local, regional and global factors and calling for better inventorization based on micro level data.

Rice paddies are responsible for 10% of global methane emissions, roughly equal to the emissions of the aviation industry. Drip irrigation systems developed by Netafim and N-Drip were introduced in several countries and according to the Times of Israel can reduce up to 85% of emissions.

<text>The transnationale Universiteit Limburg (abbreviation tUL and translation in English is: &#x27;transnational University Limburg&#x27;) is based in Belgium and the Netherlands. The tUL was founded together by both the Universiteit Maastricht and the Limburgs Universitair Centrum, now Hasselt University as a way to co-operate better.

== Organisational structure ==
The tUL has a quite complicated organisational structure. Even though it has been created out of two already existing universities, it legally is not dependent on any of them. Both in Belgium and the Netherlands the tUL is a single university, separate from both founding universities.

The tUL, even though being totally separate from the LUC and the UM, is not housed on its own campus. The campus is split up along two locations, Diepenbeek in Belgium and Maastricht in the Netherlands. It currently consists out of two schools, the School of Life Sciences and the School of Information Technology.

== History ==
The tUL, even though only officially founded in 2000, has a longer history. Starting as early as 1988 the two parent universities have been opening discussions to co-operate better. In 1992 both universities offered the study &quot;Computer Science/Knowledge Engineering&quot;. The course was given in both universities and students had to attend classes on both campuses. In 1998 a mixed Dutch/Belgian committee proposed the idea of an official transnational university, which got accepted by the Flemish government in 1999. In 2001 the treaty was signed by the Dutch and Belgian minister of education officially instating the tUL as the first Belgian-Dutch transnational university. The studies &quot;Computer Science/Knowledge Engineering&quot; and &quot;Biomedical Sciences&quot; were the first offered by the university. In 2002 the university started offering &quot;Molecular Life Sciences&quot; as a third option. The official number of students starting college in 2001 was at 526, 220 for Biomedical Sciences and 306 for Computer Science/Knowledge Engineering. The university is an example of international collaboration in education.

== Current developments ==
Even though the number of students studying &quot;Computer Science/Knowledge Engineering&quot; before the official instantiation of the tUL had been rising every year, the launch of this new university brought along some problems, decreasing the student count. The tUL was not allowed to advertise itself in Dutch study guides because it was not an official Dutch University. Also, there were issues concerning national differences (amongst others on the legal/financial division of responsibilities), and also on the Dutch side the tUL was considered a prestige/vanity project of former Maastricht University board chairman Karl Dittrich.

<text>Edgbaston () is a suburb of Birmingham, West Midlands, England. It lies immediately south-west of Birmingham city centre, and was historically in Warwickshire. The wards of Edgbaston and North Edgbaston had a combined population of 42,295 at the 2021 census.

Edgbaston is the location of Edgbaston Cricket Ground, the University of Birmingham, Birmingham Botanical Gardens, and the Edgbaston Archery and Lawn Tennis Society, the oldest lawn tennis club in the world.

==Etymology==
Edgbaston means &quot;village of a man called Ecgbald&quot;, from the Old English personal name + &quot;tun&quot; &quot;farm&quot;. The personal name&quot; Ecgbald&quot; means &quot;bold sword&quot; (literally &quot;bold edge&quot;). The name was recorded as a village known as &quot;Celboldistane&quot; in the Hundred of Coleshill in the 1086 Domesday Book until at least 1139, wrongly suggesting that Old English &quot;stān&quot; &quot;stone, rock&quot; is the final element of the name.

== History ==
In the 19th century, the area was under the control of the Gough-Calthorpe family and the Gillott family, who refused to allow factories or warehouses to be built in Edgbaston, making it attractive for the wealthier residents of the city. It then came to be known as &quot;where the trees begin&quot;. One of these private houses is grade one listed and open to the public.

==Demography==

In 1801, Edgbaston had a population of around 1,000 people. By 1841, this had increased to 16,500 as a result of wealthy manufacturers moving to the area. By 1850, 29 roads had been laid out and uninterrupted growth continued.

The United Kingdom Census 2001 found that 20,749 people were living in the Birmingham City Council ward of Edgbaston, in 8,666 households.

It also had a lower proportion of people of working age at 73.8%, although it was above the national percentage of 61.5%.

Edgbaston has a slightly above average percentage for ethnic minorities with ethnic minorities representing 31.8% of the population as opposed to 29.6% for Birmingham. The largest ethnic minority group was the British Asian group at 16.1%. 25.6% of people were born outside of the United Kingdom, above the Birmingham figure of 16.5%. Christianity was the predominant religion, with 52.5% of the population stating that they were Christians, compared with 59.1% for Birmingham. 8.0% stated that they were Muslims, below the Birmingham figure of 14.3%. Edgbaston was home to a significant Orthodox Jewish community. 19.1% of the Edgbaston population stated that they had no religion.

46.4% of households were owner-occupied, below the Birmingham figure of 60.4%. 19.3% were rented privately, 15.2% were rented from a housing association and 11.6% were rented from Birmingham City Council. There was a total number of 9,191 houses in Edgbaston, 525 of which were vacant. At 45.6%, the largest proportion of houses in Edgbaston were purpose-built blocks of flats. This is much higher than the city average of 17.9%. Detached houses were the second most common housing type in the ward at 19.7%.

Edgbaston had an unemployment rate of 8.1%, below the city average of 9.5% although above the national average of 5%. 13.4% of the population stated themselves as students. Of the unemployed, 42% were in long term unemployment and 15.6% had never worked. At 24.6%, the majority of the population worked in finance, real estate, and business activities. The largest employer in the area was the Heart of Birmingham Primary Care Trust, employing 10,000 people.

The Edgbaston Parliamentary Constituency has a much higher population.

== Governance ==
Edgbaston forms two wards within the metropolitan district of Birmingham, Edgbaston and North Edgbaston, which each elects two councillors to Birmingham City Council. The parliamentary constituency of Edgbaston comprises the two wards and the wards of Bartley Green, Harborne and Quinton. Edgbaston is also a &#x27;council constituency&#x27;, managed by its own district committee.

In 1911 the civil parish had a population of 26,398. On 1 April 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham.

Warwickshire County Cricket Club is based at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground, the area historically being part of Warwickshire. As well as hosting regular county matches, the ground plays host to the England cricket team during one day internationals and test matches.

The area also has a world class tennis venue, the Edgbaston Priory Club. The DFS Classic for female players has been held there every year since 1982 and some of the world&#x27;s top players participate. The tournament is part of the WTA Tour and wins count towards world rankings. The oldest lawn tennis club in the world, the Edgbaston Archery and Lawn Tennis Society, founded in 1860 is nearby.

There is also a members-only golf course, which offers views over the southern part of the suburb. Edgbaston Croquet Club has been located in the area since 1915.

==Places of interest==
The Church of England parish churches are St Augustine&#x27;s Church, SS Mary and Ambrose, St Germain&#x27;s Church, St. George&#x27;s Church and St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, also known as Edgbaston Old Church. Birmingham Central Synagogue built in 1961 is also in Edgbaston. The Roman Catholic church of the Birmingham Oratory, on Hagley Road, was built in 1907 in the Baroque style as a memorial to John Henry Newman, who founded the English Oratory here. Its dome is a prominent landmark.

The writer and academic J. R. R. Tolkien lived in Edgbaston during his teenage years, and the two towers of Edgbaston, Perrott&#x27;s Folly and the Waterworks Tower, both close to the Oratory, are said to have provided inspiration for &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, part of his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The Barber Institute of Fine Arts, which is located on the University of Birmingham campus, is a purpose-built gallery which contains a wide range of art from the Old Masters to Picasso.

Edgbaston Reservoir, formerly known as Rotton Park Reservoir, provides a header supply for the Birmingham Canal Navigations and is an important inner city leisure amenity. There are three public gardens located within Edgbaston; the Birmingham Botanical Gardens and the lesser known University of Birmingham Winterbourne Botanic Garden and Martineau Gardens. Adjoining the university gardens is Edgbaston Pool (not to be confused with the reservoir) which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Deer&#x27;s Leap Wood is a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation in the former Mitchells &amp; Butlers (brewery) land in the north part of Edgbaston. Edgbaston contains the only Grade I listed domestic building in Birmingham, an Arts &amp; Crafts house at 21 Yateley Road, designed by Herbert Tudor Buckland, and built for his own use. Edgbaston Hall, a Grade II listed country hall, is located within the ward. It is currently the clubhouse for Edgbaston Golf Club.

The BBC opened its Pebble Mill Studios at Pebble Mill in 1971, which were in use for 33 years until their closure in October 2004 and demolition the following year. The site is now the location of the new Birmingham Dental Hospital.

==Politics==
Birmingham Edgbaston is a constituency, and its Member of Parliament (MP) is Labour&#x27;s Preet Gill.

The suburb is split into two wards (Edgbaston ward and Edgbaston North ward) on Birmingham City Council. There are two councillors in each. Edgbaston is represented by two Conservative councillors and North Edgbaston is represented by two Labour councillors. Of the other wards of the Edgbaston constituency, Bartley Green is represented by two Conservative councillors, Harborne by two Labour councillors, and Quinton by two Labour councillors.

The constituency has sent a female member to Parliament for the past 68 years. Previous MPs included Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was born in Edgbaston.

==Education==

Since the beginning of the 20th century, Edgbaston has been home to Edgbaston High School for Girls, St Paul&#x27;s School for Girls, St George&#x27;s School, King Edward&#x27;s School, King Edward VI Five Ways School, King Edward VI High School for Girls and Priory School. 

Two universities have campuses in Edgbaston, the University of Birmingham and Birmingham City University; there are numerous university halls of residence in the area. The Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower, one of Birmingham&#x27;s tallest buildings, can be found at the centre of the University of Birmingham.

In addition, the area is also home to a number of independent preparatory schools namely, West House School, Norfolk House School and Hallfield School, along with primary intakes at Edgbaston High School for Girls, Priory School and St Georges School.

Edgbaston is also the home of Queen&#x27;s College, an ecumenical theological college. West House School, independent primary schools Birmingham Blue Coat School and Hallfield School [ St Swithun&#x27;s School ] are also located in the area. The Elmhurst School for Dance, the oldest vocational dance school in the United Kingdom, relocated to a new building in Edgbaston in 2004. St Philip&#x27;s Grammar School used to be located adjacent to the Oratory. However, it became a sixth form college in 1976 and then merged with South Birmingham College in 1995.

==Transport and amenities==
Two railway stations serve the area. The first, University station, is found in south Edgbaston, west of University of Birmingham. The second is Five Ways railway station in the north of the ward on the city&#x27;s Middle Ring Road. Both stations are on the Cross-City Line. Between these two stations used to be another, Somerset Road station; however, this was closed and demolished in 1930.

The A38 Bristol Road runs through the ward and is one of the main traffic arteries of the city reaching out to the south-west of the city and beyond from the city centre and New Street. Buses frequently stop along this route. There are several other bus routes throughout. The Worcester &amp; Birmingham Canal passes through the area, connecting the city centre with the River Severn at Worcester. This was constructed and opened in the 1790s and is now used mainly for leisure and recreational purposes as opposed to its original industrial usage.

The A456 Hagley Road runs through the north of Edgbaston and gives a relatively swift link with the city centre as well as further away places including Halesowen, Kidderminster and Hereford.

The nearest public libraries to the area are in Harborne, Selly Oak and Balsall Heath, whilst the University of Birmingham main library (which members of the public can join for a fee) is in the area. There are a number medical facilities in the area, with some of the most well known being the University Medical Centre and the Calthorpe Clinic. A large hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, is located within the area, with the former Selly Oak Hospital site nearby.

Edgbaston Village tram stop opened as the terminus of the West Midlands Metro in July 2022.

<doc id="541858" wikidata="Q265814" url="?curid=541858" title="Elyesa Bazna">
<text>Elyesa Bazna (), sometimes known as Ilyaz and Iliaz Bazna (; 28 July 1904  – 21 December 1970), was a secret agent for Nazi Germany during World War II, operating under the code name Cicero.

In 1943, Bazna was hired as a valet by Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador in Ankara, Turkey. He photographed British documents in Knatchbull-Hugessen&#x27;s possession, and sold them to the Germans through their attaché Ludwig Carl Moyzisch in what became known as the &quot;Cicero affair&quot;.

As Cicero, Bazna passed on important information about many of the Allied leaders&#x27; conferences, including the Moscow, Tehran and Cairo Conferences. The details for the Tehran Conference were important for Operation Long Jump, the unsuccessful plot to kill Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill.

Bazna had also conveyed a document that carried the highest security restriction (BIGOT list) about Operation Overlord (the code name for the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944). It included intelligence that the British ambassador was to request the use of Turkish air bases &quot;to maintain a threat to the Germans from the eastern Mediterranean until Overlord is launched.&quot; The information about the Normandy Invasion was not known by the Germans until after the war. Had it been provided in time, Operation Overlord (the preparations for D-Day) would have been compromised. He also provided intelligence that might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans.

The information that he leaked is believed to have been among the more damaging disclosures made by an agent during WWII. The German Foreign Office questioned the reliability of the intelligence provided by &quot;Cicero&quot; due to the large quantity of transmitted documents, which meant that apparently little, if any, of it was acted upon. It seems likely that he had received some intelligence training from the Italian secret intelligence service, SIM. This would explain much, for as Wilfred Dunderdale later stated, &quot;We always thought Cicero was an Italian agent because of his modus operandi - they gave their agents special training in locksmithery and in infiltrating diplomatic households.&quot;

After the war, Bazna lived in Ankara with his family for many years and obtained work doing odd jobs. Much of the money the Germans had paid him was revealed to be counterfeit. He moved to Munich in 1960 and worked as a night watchman before dying in 1970 of kidney disease. In 1962, Bazna published a memoir about the &quot;Cicero&quot; affair.

==Early life and family==

Bazna was born in 1904 in Pristina, Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (now Kosovo). His parents were of Albanian heritage. His father was a teacher of Islamic doctrine and a landowner. He later stated that his father was a Muslim mullah named Hafiz Yazan Bazna, one of his uncles was Major General Kemal. His grandfather was Tahir Pasha the Brave. Both his grandfather and uncle were Young Turks who served under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

When he was 14, Serb forces captured Bazna&#x27;s birthplace and his family relocated during the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire to Istanbul, which was then occupied by British, Italian and American Allied forces of World War I. The nationalists opposed the occupying forces.

According to Bazna, he attended a military academy in Fatih, Turkey, before 1919. At age 16 he joined a French military unit in Istanbul. He claimed to have stolen British weapons and cars for the Turkish National Movement, which was led by Atatürk.

Richard Wires, author of &quot;Cicero&quot;, stated that Bazna was not motivated to steal for political or patriotic reasons. When he was caught stealing he was sent to a penal labor camp in Marseille, France, for three years. He reportedly worked at the Berliet motor company after he left the labor camp. While there, he learned locksmithing skills.

In 1925, Bazna moved to Istanbul, where he worked for the Istanbul Corp. in the transportation department. He then worked as a fire brigade chief in Yozgat before returning to Istanbul to drive taxis.

Bazna spoke Albanian, Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, and French, the latter of which was the standard language of diplomacy at that time. He knew a little German from singing Lieder and said that he could read basic English but had difficulty speaking it. He was trained as an opera singer.

Bazna married twice; with his first wife, whom he later divorced, he had four children. He had several live-in mistresses, one of whom, Mara, was a nursemaid to the children of Douglas Busk, a British ambassador. Mara lived with him in the Kavaklıdere hills in a small house that he called &quot;Cicero Villa&quot;. Their relationship was tumultuous and Bazna ended the affair due to their fighting and her jealousy. However, she was loyal to him and passed important information to him twice, once about the upcoming arrival of British security men at the embassy and the second time when she said that she had heard rumors that the Germans had a good source of intelligence. Once he began seeing a new mistress, Esra, his relationship with Mara ended permanently.

After Esra, he took a woman named Aika as his mistress and set her up in an apartment. She left after his pound notes were determined to be counterfeit. He married for a second time to a woman named Duriet and had four more children.

==Espionage career==

===Background: Turkey during World War II===
Turkey was neutral during much of World War II, although in October 1939 Britain signed a treaty to protect Turkey should Germany attack it. Turkey maintained its neutrality by preventing German troops from crossing its borders into Syria or the USSR. During this time Turkey had lucrative trade relationships with Germany and the UK.

Germany had significant business interests in Turkey, including banks, and beginning in 1941 it was reliant on chromite, chromium ore, from Turkey for its armament production. In 1943 all of the chromite Germany imported for its weaponry came from Turkey.

Throughout the war Turkey&#x27;s economy was reliant on and prospered by virtue of its affiliation with both the Allies and the Axis powers. As a result, the country&#x27;s gold reserve had risen to 216 tons by the end of 1945, from 27 tons at the beginning of the war.

Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid, and then began imposing economic sanctions in 1943 to force Turkey to enter the war. The Allied powers wanted Turkey to become engaged in a fight against Germany&#x27;s eastern flank; however, Turkey was afraid of being overrun by the Russian and German armies, both of which were led by dictators.

The Allied and Axis powers became increasingly involved in espionage in Turkey to protect their own strategic interests beginning in 1943. There were two Allied factions, the western Allies and the Soviet Union. Germany was the third entity engaged in intelligence gathering. The Germans were able to fund their espionage, propaganda and diplomacy efforts from the profits of its banks in Turkey and through counterfeiting.

By August 1944 Turkey broke off relations with Germany, as its defeat began to seem inevitable. In February 1945 it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the emerging United Nations.

===Employment by diplomats===
Bazna worked for foreign diplomats and consulates as a doorman, driver and guard upon his return to Turkey. Aided by his ability to speak French, he served as a &quot;kavass&quot; or valet, first to the Yugoslav ambassador to Turkey. In 1942, he worked as a valet for Albert Jenke, a German businessman and later embassy staff member, who came to fire Bazna for reading his mail.

Before he worked for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in 1943, Bazna was hired to do some household and vehicle repairs for Douglas Busk, the First Secretary of the British Embassy. Due to Bazna&#x27;s poor English, he answered all interview questions in French. Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked. The Turkish secret service apparently warned the embassy at some point about Bazna. Over the few months that he worked for Busk, Bazna secretly photographed a few documents and, with the help of Mrs. Busk&#x27;s nursemaid Mara, he tried to gain access to more valuable forms of intelligence.

Busk agreed to recommend Bazna for the open position of valet to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador to Turkey, who hired him in 1943 assuming that a background check had been performed. Knatchbull-Hugessen had been the British ambassador in Riga, Latvia, until 1935.

Anthony Cave Brown, author of &quot;Bodyguard of Lies&quot;, wrote, &quot;Soon, Bazna had ingratiated himself to the extent that Sir Hughe elevated him from purely household duties to a position of some power within the residency and embassy. He dressed him in an imposing blue uniform, gave him a peaked cap, and used him as a guard to the door of his study; Bazna excluded visitors when Sir Hughe was thinking or napping. For ceremonial occasions, Sir Hughe dressed him in richly embroidered brocade, shoes with turned up toes, a fez with a tassel, gave him an immense scimitar, and placed him on the main door. Sir Hughe also paid him more than the 100 Turkish &quot;lira&quot; that was standard for a valet, and quietly turned a blind eye to the fact that Bazna was having an affair with Lady Knatchbull-Hugessen&#x27;s nursemaid in the servants&#x27; quarters.&quot; Bazna often sang German Lieder after lunch while Knatchbull-Hugessen played the piano, much to the ambassador&#x27;s enjoyment.

===Beginning of espionage career===
While at Riga, Knatchbull-Hugessen had developed a habit of taking secret papers to his home from the British embassy, and continued that practice in Ankara. Bazna gained access to documents in the ambassador&#x27;s document box and safe using his locksmithing skills, including making impressions and then copies of the key for the document box. He began photographing secret documents about war strategy, troop movements and negotiations with Turkey to enter the war. He took the photographs while the ambassador slept, took a bath or played the piano.

Bazna approached the German Embassy in Ankara on 1943, indicating that he wanted two rolls of film of the ambassador&#x27;s documents. He became a spy through the connection with his former employer, Albert Jenke. Jenke was the brother-in-law of Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister. Although Bazna was fired by Jenke, his wife contacted German intelligence officer Ludwig Carl Moyzisch, serving as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) officer attached to the German embassy in Ankara, and told him of the photographs that Bazna had taken of classified information at the British Embassy. He became a paid German agent under Moyzisch and was given the SD code name &quot;Cicero&quot; by German Ambassador Franz von Papen due to Bazna&#x27;s &quot;astonishing eloquence&quot;. His Nazi paymasters made about of his payments in counterfeit bank notes under Operation Bernhard.

According to Mummer Kaylan, author of &quot;The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey&quot;, Bazna said he had begun spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, although he was not a Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the &quot;Milli Emniyet Hizmeti&quot;, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965.

British historian Richard Wires wrote that Bazna was motivated entirely by greed, as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich but who was easily duped by the Germans.

Wilfred Dunderdale stated his opinion about whether Bazna received training from the Italian secret intelligence service, SIM, &quot;We always thought Cicero was an Italian agent because of his modus operandi - they gave their agents special training in locksmithery and in infiltrating diplomatic households.&quot;

===Intelligence===

During the first three months of 1944, &quot;Cicero&quot; supplied the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer&#x27;s dispatch box or safe. Photographs of top-secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch&#x27;s car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara, as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped.

Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park, routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.

Guy Liddell, who worked for MI5, recorded that there was a breach in security at the embassy on 1943, which was later reported by ISOS, Intelligence Service Oliver Strachey. The leak involved an embassy diplomat bag and two agents. On Liddell talked to Stewart Menzies, head of the British Secret Intelligence Service. From the discussion Liddell learned that the leak of the diplomatic bag occurred during or after the air attaché brought it back from Cairo, which put not-yet-deployed re-ciphering tables at risk and required the abandonment of the tables. There were also missing blueprints for a gun at the office of a military attaché. Menzies stated that there was an investigation underway at the embassy, but nothing more was said about the leak for a few months.
As Cicero, Bazna passed on important information about many of the Allied leaders&#x27; conferences, including the Moscow, Tehran and Cairo Conferences. Fortunately for the British, Knatchbull-Hugessen only had possession of one document of notes from the conferences.

The intelligence provided by &quot;Cicero&quot; included a document instructing Knatchbull-Hugessen to request the use of Turkish air bases &quot;to maintain a threat to the Germans from the eastern Mediterranean until Overlord is launched.&quot; The document carried the highest security restriction (BIGOT list). &quot;Cicero&quot; conveyed limited information about Operation Overlord (the code name for the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944), which was not correlated by the Germans until after the war when films about Cicero were released.

According to the British Foreign Office&#x27;s postwar review of Cicero&#x27;s potential impacts, &quot;It [Bazna&#x27;s intelligence] provided the Germans with streams of information from the desk of the ambassador about British and Allied intentions in the Near and Middle East and for the conduct of the war generally, and might easily have compromised Operation Overlord (the preparations for D-Day).&quot;

When the Cicero documents predicted Allied bombing missions in the Balkans, which took place on the predicted date, the authenticity of the information was supported and his reputation enhanced. Moyzisch told Cicero that at the end of the war Hitler intended to give him a villa.

===Appraisal by the Germans===
Copies of the developed film or summaries prepared by Moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. He concluded, though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.

According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did not make much use of the documents, because officers there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was a steady stream of documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between von Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces&#x27; attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, von Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey&#x27;s alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, von Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.

===Double agent hypothesis===
The Abwehr was right to worry about the presence of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running &quot;Garbo&quot; (Juan Pujol), &quot;Zig-Zag&quot; (Eddie Chapman) and &quot;Tricycle&quot; (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying large sums of money but who were in reality working for the British and supplying the Germans with false information.

The head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, stated that Cicero was indeed a double agent and that among the documents submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was &quot;&#x27;turned&#x27; into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen&quot;. Malcolm Gladwell, author of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Briefcase&quot;, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether he was telling the truth. Menzies told the interviewer, &quot;Of course, Cicero was under our control,&quot; but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;If you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before your death, you probably would say that Cicero was one of yours.&quot; Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna&#x27;s intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.

Anthony Cave Brown suggests in his book &quot;Bodyguard of Lies&quot; that MI6&#x27;s continental secret service chief, Lt. Col. Montague Reaney Chidson, who was responsible for security of the embassy, would not have overlooked Bazna as a potential threat and may have fed the documents that Bazna found in the ambassador&#x27;s keeping or directly led Cicero as a double agent. Brown states that &quot;Bazna was indeed under British control within a short time after he started to photograph the documents&quot;, and he was a participant in Plan Jael and Operation Bodyguard.

Mummer Kaylan states that through his personal knowledge of Bazna, he thought that Bazna supported Turkish interests and was not guided by British Intelligence. Further, he says that Bazna having passed on &quot;genuine&quot;, &quot;important&quot; intelligence and the codeword for Operation Overlord to the Germans supports his theory that Bazna was not a double agent. If he was a double agent, Kaylan believes, he was an agent for the Turkish Security Service, Milli Emniyet Hizmeti. Walter Schellenberg, too, wondered if Bazna passed on intelligence to the Turkish Secret Service.

===Discovery of intelligence leaks===

Kolbe, assistant to German diplomat Karl Ritter, screened German cable messages for information to summarize and supply to Allen Dulles, who was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) chief representative in Bern. In late December 1943 Kolbe reported that there was a spy operating out of a British Embassy with the code name &quot;Cicero&quot;. Dulles forwarded this information to MI6 agent Frederick Vanden Heuvel on 1944.

Cave Brown contends that Dulles passed the information to London in December. As Bazna was about to carry out acts of espionage in December, Brown concludes that Bazna was likely a double agent.

American agents in Ankara investigated Cicero&#x27;s identity based upon Dulles&#x27; intelligence. British intelligence, which was asked by Dulles to interrogate Cicero, gave the impression that it believed Bazna could not speak English and, furthermore, was &quot;too stupid&quot; to be a spy. British Foreign Office workers, though, were concerned about Operation Overlord leaks and thought that Bazna might be Cicero. They implemented a sting in January 1944 using a false Cabinet Office document that was drafted by the chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, and given the forged signature of Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The document was planted in the embassy, but the sting was unsuccessful in trapping Bazna.

Around January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new secretary named Cornelia Kapp, also known as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to emigrate to the US. She had worked at the German embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria, beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944 she moved to Ankara to work at the German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. She was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with &quot;Cicero&quot; when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, she also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all she felt she could expect to learn about Cicero.

Once the embassy had been tipped off that there was a spy operating in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the US. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador&#x27;s safe.

Bazna gave notice about the third week of January 1944 that he would be leaving the ambassador&#x27;s employment. He stopped selling information to the Germans by the end of February 1944 and left the embassy at the end of the month or about without any trouble. Bazna was identified as Cicero after the war ended.

=== Potential consequences ===

In March 2005 British Foreign and Commonwealth Office historians issued &quot;The Cicero Papers&quot;, an analysis of the potential consequences of the &#x27;Cicero Affair&#x27;. In it they identified four important ways in which Cicero&#x27;s intelligence could have harmed the Allied forces during World War II.

One of the key potential consequences was the possibility of alerting the German regime to the scope of Project Overlord. Fortunately, the location and date of the planned invasion were not conveyed. Allied forces wanted Turkey to declare war and join them in their efforts against Germany, particularly after they had taken the Dodecanese Islands and had secured Italy as a partner against Germany.

Turkish airfields were important to maintain their strategic advantage in the area, particularly to support Operation Accolade, the British assault on Rhodes and the Dodecanese Islands. With Cicero&#x27;s intelligence, von Papen was able to delay Turkey&#x27;s entry into the war.

Bazna passed on the details for the Tehran Conference plans. Once the British became aware of the leak they were concerned &quot;Cicero&quot; had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur. Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.

==After the war==
After the war ended the OSS conducted an investigation into &quot;Cicero&quot;, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by &quot;Cicero&quot; to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen&#x27;s notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI [one of the 11 departments of Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle], to be too old to be of much value to the Germans.

Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumours and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with war crimes.

Knatchbull-Hugessen&#x27;s reputation was severely affected by the Cicero Affair, particularly as he had been previously warned about leaving his keys and document boxes unattended. On 1945, Knatchbull-Hugessen received a formal reprimand.

The Abwehr paid Bazna £300,000, which he kept hidden. After the war he tried to build a hotel with a partner, but when his sterling notes were checked by the Bank of England, they were found to be mostly counterfeit (see Operation Bernhard). The spy remarked that the notes were &quot;not worth even the price of the Turkish linen out of which they had been manufactured.&quot; Bazna served some time in prison for using counterfeit money.

Bazna lived in an apartment in the European Aksaray neighbourhood of Istanbul with his family in the 1950s. He gave singing lessons and worked selling used cars and as a night watchman.

Much of the money he earned went to the creditors who had been paid with forged money. He contacted the West German government to be reimbursed for the counterfeit money that he received. Although he tried many times and in many ways to get paid, he never received any money.

In 1960 Bazna moved to Germany and worked in Munich as a night watchman. Bazna and Hans Nogly wrote &quot;I Was Cicero&quot;, which was published in 1962. It told the story of the &quot;Cicero Affair&quot; from Bazna&#x27;s perspective following Moyzisch&#x27;s book &quot;Operation Cicero&quot; published in 1950. Bazna died in Munich of kidney disease in December 1970, aged 66.

==In popular culture==
According to the British Foreign Office: &quot;The tale has become a popular (and frequently mis-told) war story.&quot;

Moyzisch published his memoirs, titled &quot;Operation Cicero&quot;, in 1950. Franz von Papen and Allen Dulles suggested that there was more to the story than was published in the book, but neither provided any details. Twelve years later, in 1962, &quot;I Was Cicero&quot; was published by Cicero himself.

A film based on Moyzisch&#x27;s book &quot;Operation Cicero&quot; was released by 20th Century-Fox in 1952. It was titled &quot;5 Fingers&quot; and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Bazna, renamed Ulysses Diello, was played by James Mason.

A 2019 Turkish language film entitled &quot;Operation Cicero&quot; was released. OT was an enjoyable but highly romanticised account based on some of the original events and characters.

==History==
===World War II===
After the liberation of the area by Allied Forces in early June 1944, engineers of the Ninth Air Force IX Engineering Command began construction of a combat Advanced Landing Ground outside of the town. Declared operational on 14 June, the airfield was designated as &quot;A-3&quot;, it was used by the 368th Fighter Group which flew P-47 Thunderbolts until the end of August when the unit moved into Central France. Along with the 368th, the 370th Fighter Group flew P-38 Lightnings from the airfield until mid-August. With the combat units moved out, the airfield was closed.

<text>Tore André Flo (born 15 June 1973) is a Norwegian professional football coach and a former striker who previously was the manager of 1. divisjon club Sogndal.

He was capped 76 times, scoring 23 goals for Norway, and represented his country in 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, and scored Norway&#x27;s first goal when Norway won 2–1 against Brazil and advanced to the second round of the 1998 World Cup.

During his professional career, he played for Sogndal, Tromsø and Brann in Tippeligaen, before he moved abroad and played for Chelsea. After a successful spell with the English club, he was sold to Rangers for £12 million and became the most expensive Norwegian player. Flo later had spells at Sunderland, Siena, Vålerenga and Leeds United before he announced his retirement in March 2008. He later made two comebacks; for Milton Keynes Dons in November 2008 and the Norwegian club Sogndal in March 2011. In August 2012 he announced his retirement for the third time. He subsequently rejoined Chelsea as a member of their coaching staff.

==Early life==
Flo hails from the village of Flo in the municipality of Stryn in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. He comes from a family of footballers.

==Club career==
===Sogndal===
Flo started his career with his local amateur club Stryn. In 1993, he moved to Sogndal, playing with his brothers Jostein and Jarle. Tore André Flo made his debut in Tippeligaen on 17 April 1994 against Tromsø. When Sogndal was relegated from Tippeligaen in 1994, Flo was transferred to Tromsø.

===Tromsø===
In Tromsø, Flo became a success: he scored 18 goals in the 1995-season, and was the club&#x27;s top goalscorer. His performances in that season culminated in Flo making his debut for the Norwegian national team.

===Brann===
Flo moved to Bergen in 1996 to play for Brann. He continued to play well, and scored 28 goals during his stay there. During his years in Brann, Flo arguably became one of Norway&#x27;s best attackers.

In the first half of the 1997 season, however, he was not considered a great success by most of the Brann fans, perhaps because his mind was already in Chelsea, which he signed for under disputed circumstances. He did, however, score a hat-trick in his last game for Brann before leaving for Chelsea.

===Chelsea===
Flo was bought for £300,000 by the English Premier League team Chelsea in the summer of 1997.

Flo made his debut for Chelsea against Coventry City, and scored in a 3–2 loss for his side. He scored 15 goals in his debut season for Chelsea, including a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane and two in a 6–2 win over Crystal Palace as Chelsea finished 4th in the Premier League and won the League Cup and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Flo made a particularly important contribution in the latter tournament, hitting two away goals against Real Betis in the quarter-finals.

A year later, as Chelsea challenged for the title, Flo hit ten league goals, but constantly found his playing opportunities limited by manager Gianluca Vialli&#x27;s squad rotation policy and the signing of Italian striker Pierluigi Casiraghi. The Blues eventually finished third, high enough for their first ever UEFA Champions League qualification. Flo scored 19 goals in the 1999–00 season, making him Chelsea&#x27;s top scorer and helping the club win the FA Cup and reach the Champions League quarter-finals, where he scored twice in a 3–1 win over Barcelona at Stamford Bridge. He scored another at the Camp Nou in the return game against Barca, though the team ultimately lost 5–1 (it was 3–1 at full-time, with Chelsea conceding two goals in extra time). By the start of the 2000–01 season, Chelsea had signed strikers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eiður Guðjohnsen, despite scoring two goals and assisting one in a 3–3 away tie against Manchester United, he was again forced onto the substitutes&#x27; bench, and he requested a move away. He made 163 appearances for Chelsea (70 of which were as a substitute) and scored 50 goals.

===Rangers===
In November 2000, Flo was sold to Scottish Premier League team Rangers, in a record £12 million deal, making Flo the most expensive Norwegian player ever at the time, Rangers&#x27; most expensive signing and the biggest transfer by any Scottish club.

Much was expected of Flo, and he started off well by scoring on his début in a 5–1 victory over Rangers&#x27; archrivals Celtic, and hit 18 goals in 30 SPL games. His second season at Rangers was considered his best in Scotland, scoring 22 goals in 42 games, including the opening goal in the 2002 League Cup final win over Ayr United.

===Sunderland===
He was sold to Sunderland on transfer deadline day at the beginning of the 2002–03 season. Flo&#x27;s arrival was announced alongside fellow striker Marcus Stewart, and the total cost of the transfers were declared as £10m. The individual prices were not made clear by Sunderland, although a figure of £8.2 million for Flo was widely quoted by the media. Sunderland have since confirmed that he was bought for £6.75 million, making him Sunderland&#x27;s second most expensive purchase. Sunderland&#x27;s manager Peter Reid had been under-fire throughout pre-season for his failure to buy a big-name striker as a long-term replacement for the ageing Niall Quinn. The relatively high price-tag for a player who was struggling in Scotland, and the late hour of his signing led many fans, and pundits including legend Jimmy Montgomery to believe that Flo was a deadline-day panic buy. Once again he scored in his debut match, a 1–1 draw with Manchester United.

It was clear by Sunderland&#x27;s tactics that Reid expected Flo to slot into the role of veteran Niall Quinn (who retired from playing in November) as a tall target-man for long-balls. It was not a role he was comfortable with, and he struggled to form a partnership with fellow striker Kevin Phillips. When Reid was sacked in October and replaced by Howard Wilkinson, Flo immediately fell out of favour – failing to make the bench for Wilkinson&#x27;s first game – as Wilkinson publicly called into question the Norwegian&#x27;s fitness. Flo managed to work his way back into the first-team until Wilkinson&#x27;s dismissal in March. His successor, Mick McCarthy failed to give Flo 90 minutes of football in any of the remaining nine games of the season.

In 33 appearances for Sunderland Flo scored only 6 goals (4 of them in the Premiership) completing only 11 of the 23 league games he started. Sunderland were relegated to Division One, and with massive debts were forced to sell or release most players on high wages. Flo played one League Cup game in the 2003–04, but in the autumn of 2003 he was given a free transfer.

===Siena===
Flo then tried his luck in Italy, joining newly promoted Serie A team Siena on a free transfer in 2003. Flo played for Siena for two seasons, becoming a success in Italian football and helping the club establish themselves in the top division for the first time. He showed surprising versatility when he was asked by manager Giuseppe Papadopulo to play in a more withdrawn role as a second striker, behind Enrico Chiesa and Nicola Ventola, rather than in his usual role as a main striker. He excelled in this position and was ever-present for his club throughout the 2003–04 season, as he scored eight goals, helping Siena to avoid relegation: he scored his first goal for his new club against Empoli in the third round of the league on 20 September. The next goal came against Reggina in the sixth round 18 October. Later becoming matchwinner in a 1–0 home win against Udinese.

His second and last season with the club was less successful, as injuries and competition from other strikers saw him gain less playing time under manager Gigi Simoni; he only managed five goals from 17 starts throughout the 2004–05 season, and made 5 appearances as substitute, although he once again helped Siena avoid relegation. He scored the only goal in a historic 1–0 first ever victory against rivals Fiorentina. He put on another brilliant performance in November against eventual finalists Roma in a 2–1 Coppa Italia away win where he scored both of his team&#x27;s goals. Another two goals came in a 1–3 away win against Chievo in January, he also scored the 2–1 goal in a 2–2 home tie against eventual Coppa Italia champions Inter Milan.

===Vålerenga===

Flo signed for the ambitious club Vålerenga from Oslo in July 2005. He was contracted to the club until the end of the 2006 season. His stay at Vålerenga was hampered by numerous injuries that prevented him of making a serious impact. Vålerenga did not offer him a new contract at the end of the season, leaving Flo free to sign with other clubs.

===Leeds United===
On 3 January 2007, former teammate Dennis Wise brought Flo back to England, this time for Leeds United, with a contract lasting till the end of the 2006–07 Championship season. Flo made his away début as a substitute for the Yorkshire outfit in Leeds&#x27; 3–1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup. A week later Flo scored his first goal for Leeds against the same opposition after three minutes with a towering header in a league match which ended in a 3–2 defeat. Subsequent injury prevented Flo from playing any significant part during the rest of the season. Flo was believed to be set to leave Leeds due to a clause in his contract, but Leeds signed Flo with an initial one-year contract to help their 2007–08 League One campaign. He only managed to score 3 times in the League during the season, all in sub appearances. Flo was sponsored by famous Leeds fans, the Kaiser Chiefs. Flo had previously admitted that Leeds would probably be his last club before retirement. He turned into somewhat of a fans favourite without playing that much for Leeds.

In March 2008, Flo announced his retirement from football.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
On 21 November 2008, Flo came out of retirement and signed a contract with Milton Keynes Dons that lasted until the end of the season. He played his first match for MK Dons coming on as a sub against Scunthorpe on 6 December 2008. He didn&#x27;t start a match until the 3rd last game of the season against Walsall. Flo also had the misfortune of missing the ninth penalty in a tense shoot-out against Scunthorpe United which prevented MK Dons from reaching the 2009 League one play-off final at Wembley.

On 19 May 2009, Flo was released from his contract with Milton Keynes Dons.

===Sogndal===

In 2011, two years after retirement, Flo surprisingly made a second comeback at newly promoted Sogndal. He first came on as a substitute against Rosenborg on 30 July. In his first start at the last day of the season he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory against league champions Molde, then coached by Ole Gunnar Solskjær.

==International career==
Flo made 76 appearances for the Norwegian national team and made his debut in a 0–0 draw with England. He scored 23 goals, making him Norway&#x27;s joint-4th highest goalscorer, along with Ole Gunnar Solskjær. He gained the nickname &quot;Flonaldo&quot; (an obvious pun on Ronaldo, one of the world&#x27;s best strikers) when Norway beat Brazil 4–2 in a friendly match. Flo played for Norway at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal in a 2–1 win over holders Brazil as they reached the second round. Flo chose to retire from international football in 2004, deciding to prioritise his family.

==Style of play==
Flo was a quick, tall, powerful, and physically strong striker, with an eye for goal, who was known for his ability in the air; in spite of his size, he also possessed good technical skills, and was capable of playing off of his teammates.

== Managerial career ==
After retiring from playing in 2012, Flo returned his former club Chelsea as a club ambassador and a coach in their Academy (Chelsea Development Squad and Academy), working with their youth development teams, most often the Under-14s. He was later on promoted to a loan player technical coach working under the loan department of Chelsea.

On 17 November 2021, Flo was announced as the new head coach of Sogndal in Norway for the 2022 season, the club he began and ended his playing career.

==Personal life==
Flo comes from a family of footballers, with seven members of his family having played in Tippeligaen. His brother Jostein Flo and his cousin Håvard Flo have also played for a number of clubs abroad and been capped for Norway. The brothers Kjell Rune Flo and Jarle Flo have played in Tippeligaen for Molde and Sogndal, respectively. In addition have Kjell Rune&#x27;s son Ulrik Flo and Håvard&#x27;s nephew Per Egil Flo played for Sogndal in Tippeligaen. Flo supports Birmingham City. 

===Tore André Flo Academy===
In 2010 Flo and football coach Sean Faulkner founded a football academy in Berkshire. It teaches children aged from 5 to 17 at schools, clubs and holiday camps. Flo coaches some sessions.

<doc id="541898" wikidata="Q6030580" url="?curid=541898" title="Informal value transfer system">
<text>An informal value transfer system (IVTS) is any system, mechanism, or network of people that receives money for the purpose of making the funds or an equivalent value payable to a third party in another geographic location, whether or not in the same form. Informal value transfers generally take place outside of the conventional banking system through non-bank financial institutions or other business entities whose primary business activity may not be the transmission of money. The IVTS transactions occasionally interconnect with formal banking systems, such as through the use of bank accounts held by the IVTS operator.

==History==

An informal value transfer system is an alternative and unofficial remittance and banking system, that pre-dates current day modern banking systems. The systems were established as a means of settling accounts within villages and between villages. It existed as far back as over 4000 years ago and even more.

Their use as global networks for financial transactions spread as expatriates from the original countries settled abroad. Today, IVTS operations are found in most countries. Depending on the ethnic group, IVTS are called by a variety of names including, for example, &quot;hawala&quot; (Middle East, Afghanistan, Indian Sub-Continent); &quot;fei ch’ien&quot; (飞钱 or &quot;flying money&quot;; China); &quot;phoe kuan&quot; (Thailand); and &quot;Black Market Peso Exchange&quot; (South America).

Individuals or groups engaged in operating IVTS may do so on a full-time, part-time, or ad hoc basis. They may work independently, or as part of a multi-person network. IVTS are based on trust. In general, operators usually don&#x27;t misappropriate the funds entrusted to them.

==Mechanism==
The sender gives money to an IVTS agent and their counterpart in the receiver region/country acts as deliverer of this money. The sender calls or faxes instructions to his counterpart and the money gets delivered in a matter of a few hours. In the past, the message could be delivered using couriers, with men or even animals (such as pigeons). Settlements are made either with a private delivery service or wire transfer in the opposite direction. Another method of balancing the books is to under-invoice goods shipped abroad, so that the receiver can resell the products at a higher market price.

==Adoption==

IVTS are used by a variety of individuals, businesses, organisations, and even governments to remit funds domestically and abroad. Expatriates and immigrants often use IVTS to send money back to their families and friends in their home countries (for workers who worked abroad) or foreign countries (for merchants who need extra money to start a business). IVTS operations are also used by legitimate companies, traders, organisations, and government agencies needing to conduct business in countries with basic or no formal financial systems.

In some countries, IVTS-type networks operate in parallel with formal financial institutions or as a substitute or alternative for them or. Besides citizens of the host country, people (legally or illegally) residing in the host country from foreign countries may prefer or need to use IVTS in lieu of formal financial institutions for various reasons as described below:
* the host country and the receiving country have no diplomatic ties or the host country actively discourage the sending of money to the receiving country.
* the constant change in the world political environments, unsatisfiable payment systems, and/or a rapid continuously changing financial sector;
* a lack of easily accessible formal financial institutions in remote areas of some countries;
* transfers that are more efficient, reliable, and cheaper than formal financial institutions. (For example, a wire transfer of funds using banks involves fees charged to the sender and receiver, may take from two to seven days to complete, and may be delayed or lost. Funds moved through IVTS are usually available within 24 hours, with minimal or no fees charged to the participants);
* to avoid paying higher foreign exchange rates. (Funds sent through traditional transfers are converted to the currency of the recipient’s country; the fee charged for exchange rate conversion is set by the institution. IVTS operators, who speculate in currency exchange rates, charge lower fees);
* to avoid paying transfer taxes;
* to ensure anonymity since there may be minimal or no records maintained; or
* to avoid mandatory reporting of large transactions from financial institutions to governments.

Because IVTS provides security, anonymity, and versatility to the user, the systems can be also used for supplying resources for doing illegal activities. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, IVTS have come under increased scrutiny and regulation in many countries as a result of pressure from the United States.

<text>A microbiological culture, or microbial culture, is a method of multiplying microbial organisms by letting them reproduce in predetermined culture medium under controlled laboratory conditions. Microbial cultures are foundational and basic diagnostic methods used as research tools in molecular biology.

The term &quot;culture&quot; can also refer to the microorganisms being grown.

Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism, its abundance in the sample being tested, or both. It is one of the primary diagnostic methods of microbiology and used as a tool to determine the cause of infectious disease by letting the agent multiply in a predetermined medium. For example, a throat culture is taken by scraping the lining of tissue in the back of the throat and blotting the sample into a medium to be able to screen for harmful microorganisms, such as &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, the causative agent of strep throat. Furthermore, the term culture is more generally used informally to refer to &quot;selectively growing&quot; a specific kind of microorganism in the lab.

It is often essential to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms. A pure (or &quot;axenic&quot;) culture is a population of cells or multicellular organisms growing in the absence of other species or types. A pure culture may originate from a single cell or single organism, in which case the cells are genetic clones of one another. For the purpose of gelling the microbial culture, the medium of agarose gel (agar) is used. Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. A cheap substitute for agar is guar gum, which can be used for the isolation and maintenance of thermophiles.

== History ==
The first culture media was liquid media, designed by Louis Pasteur in 1860. This was used in the laboratory until Robert Koch&#x27;s development of solid media in 1881. Koch&#x27;s method of using a flat plate for his solid media was replaced by Julius Richard Petri&#x27;s round box in 1887. Since these foundational inventions, a diverse array of media and methods have evolved to help scientists grow, identify, and purify cultures of microorganisms.

== Types of microbial cultures ==
=== Prokaryotic culture ===
The culturing of prokaryotes typically involves bacteria, since archaea are difficult to culture in a laboratory setting. To obtain a pure prokaryotic culture, one must start the culture from a single cell or a single colony of the organism. Since a prokaryotic colony is the asexual offspring of a single cell, all of the cells are genetically identical and will result in a pure culture.

===Viral culture===

Virus and phage cultures require host cells in which the virus or phage multiply. For bacteriophages, cultures are grown by infecting bacterial cells. The phage can then be isolated from the resulting plaques in a lawn of bacteria on a plate. Viral cultures are obtained from their appropriate eukaryotic host cells. The streak plate method is a way to physically separate the microbial population, and is done by spreading the inoculate back and forth with an inoculating loop over the solid agar plate. Upon incubation, colonies will arise and single cells will have been isolated from the biomass. Once a microorganism has been isolated in pure culture, it is necessary to preserve it in a viable state for further study and use in cultures called stock cultures. These cultures have to be maintained, such that there is no loss of their biological, immunological and cultural characters.

=== Eukaryotic cell culture ===

Eukaryotic cell cultures provide a controlled environment for studying eukaryotic organisms. Single-celled eukaryotes - such as yeast, algae, and protozoans - can be cultured in similar ways to prokaryotic cultures. The same is true for multicellular microscopic eukaryotes, such as &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

Although macroscopic eukaryotic organisms are too large to culture in a laboratory, cells taken from these organisms can be cultured. This allows researchers to study specific parts and processes of a macroscopic eukaryote in vitro.

== Culture methods ==

=== Liquid cultures ===
One method of microbiological culture is liquid culture, in which the desired organisms are suspended in a liquid nutrient medium, such as Luria broth, in an upright flask. This allows a scientist to grow up large amounts of bacteria or other microorganisms for a variety of downstream applications.

Liquid cultures are ideal for preparation of an antimicrobial assay in which the liquid broth is inoculated with bacteria and let to grow overnight (a ‘shaker’ may be used to mechanically mix the broth, to encourage uniform growth). Subsequently, aliquots of the sample are taken to test for the antimicrobial activity of a specific drug or protein (antimicrobial peptides).

Static liquid cultures may be used as an alternative. These cultures are not shaken, and they provide the microbes with an oxygen gradient.

=== Agar plates ===

Microbiological cultures can be grown in petri dishes of differing sizes that have a thin layer of agar-based growth medium. Once the growth medium in the petri dish is inoculated with the desired bacteria, the plates are incubated at the optimal temperature for the growing of the selected bacteria (for example, usually at 37 degrees Celsius, or the human body temperature, for cultures from humans or animals, or lower for environmental cultures). After the desired level of growth is achieved, agar plates can be stored upside down in a refrigerator for an extended period of time to keep bacteria for future experiments.

There are a variety of additives that can be added to agar before it is poured into a plate and allowed to solidify. Some types of bacteria can only grow in the presence of certain additives. This can also be used when creating engineered strains of bacteria that contain an antibiotic-resistance gene. When the selected antibiotic is added to the agar, only bacterial cells containing the gene insert conferring resistance will be able to grow. This allows the researcher to select only the colonies that were successfully transformed.

=== Agar based dipsticks ===
Miniaturized version of agar plates implemented to dipstick formats, e.g. Dip Slide, Digital Dipstick show potential to be used at the point-of-care for diagnosis purposes. They have advantages over agar plates since they are cost effective and their operation does not require expertise or laboratory environment, which enable them to be used at the point-of-care.

=== Selective and differential media ===
Selective and differential media reveal characteristics about the microorganisms being cultured on them. This kind of media can be selective, differential, or both selective and differential. Growing a culture on multiple kinds of selective and differential media can purify mixed cultures and reveal to scientists the characteristics needed to identify unknown cultures.

==== Selective media ====
Selective media is used to distinguish organisms by allowing for a specific kind of organism to grow on it while inhibiting the growth of others. For example, eosin methylene blue (EMB) may be used to select against Gram-positive bacteria, most of which have hindered growth on EMB, and select for Gram-negative bacteria, whose growth is not inhibited on EMB.

==== Differential media ====
Scientists use differential media when culturing microorganisms to reveal certain biochemical characteristics about the organisms. These revealed traits can then be compared to attributes of known microorganisms in an effort to identify unknown cultures. An example of this is MacConkey agar (MAC), which reveals lactose-fermenting bacteria through a pH indicator that changes color when acids are produced from fermentation.

==== Multitarget panels ====
On multitarget panels, bacteria isolated from a previously grown colony are distributed into each well, each of which contains growth medium as well as the ingredients for a biochemical test, which will change the absorbance of the well depending on the bacterial property for the tested target. The panel will be incubated in a machine, which subsequently analyses each well with a light-based method such as colorimetry, turbidimetry, or fluorometry. The combined results will be automatically compared to a database of known results for various bacterial species, in order to generate a diagnosis of what bacterial species is present in the current panel. Simultaneously, it performs antibiotic susceptibility testing.

=== Stab cultures ===

Stab cultures are similar to agar plates, but are formed by solid agar in a test tube. Bacteria is introduced via an inoculation needle or a pipette tip being stabbed into the center of the agar. Bacteria grow in the punctured area. Stab cultures are most commonly used for short-term storage or shipment of cultures. Additionally, stab cultures can reveal characteristics about cultured microorganisms such as motility or oxygen requirements.

===Solid plate culture of thermophilic microorganisms===
For solid plate cultures of thermophilic microorganisms such as &quot;Bacillus acidocaldarius, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Thermus aquaticus&quot; and &quot;Thermus thermophilus&quot; etc. growing at temperatures of 50 to 70 degrees C, low acyl clarified gellan gum has been proven to be the preferred gelling agent comparing to agar for the counting or isolation or both of the above thermophilic bacteria.

== Cell culture collections ==
Microbial culture collections focus on the acquisition, authentication, production, preservation, cataloguing and distribution of viable cultures of standard reference microorganisms, cell lines and other materials for research in microbial systematics. Culture collection are also repositories of type strains.

<doc id="541909" wikidata="Q1017811" url="?curid=541909" title="Konginkangas bus disaster">
<text>The Konginkangas bus disaster was a major road traffic crash on 19 March 2004, outside the village of Konginkangas in Äänekoski, Central Finland. At 02:08 local time (00:08 UTC), a bus transporting 38 passengers, most of them youths, to the Rukatunturi skiing center for an alpine ski trip crashed into a full-trailer truck carrying heavy paper rolls weighing about total. The crash occurred on Finnish national road 4 (E75) north of Äänekoski, and left the bus driver and 22 passengers dead; fourteen were injured. The executive director of the youth travel company was among those who perished in the crash. Most of the victims were killed immediately by the paper rolls ejected into the bus. The truck driver was uninjured.

==Crash==
The crash occurred when the trailer of the southbound truck began a soft swerving movement on black ice, which intermittently covered the highway. The trailer first swerved to the right onto the edge of the road, then returned to the road and drifted left onto the lane of oncoming traffic. Despite an evasive attempt by the driver, the trailer continued to run in the opposite lane. The northbound bus then collided with the front wall of the trailer. Five paper rolls were ejected through the front wall of the trailer, pushing the wall and paper rolls into the bus at a speed of . The winter speed limit on the road was . The front of the bus, as well as several rows of seats, were demolished on impact.

==Investigation==

The crash was investigated by Finland&#x27;s Safety Investigation Authority (SIAF). In total, the SIAF found 32 causes of the crash, the most immediate being the truck driver&#x27;s loss of control. The main contributing factors to the crash were the choice of an unfavorable route, the high speed of the truck and the possible reduced alertness of the driver. In the SIAF&#x27;s view, none of the bus passengers wore a seat belt, while the bus driver, driving at high speed in snowy weather, made an error in observing the oncoming truck and attempted to avoid the collision too late. The SIAF found no technical defects with either vehicle. The routes of both vehicles were designed in such a way that it would not have been possible to drive them in compliance with both the speed limits in force and the drivers&#x27; driving and rest time regulations. In addition, the SIAF found that the road surface was very slippery and that an area of local slipperiness was difficult to detect or predict.

The SIAF issued seventeen safety recommendations, the most important of which could be considered to be the transfer of responsibility for transport from the driver alone to all parties involved. Other notable proposals include lowering the maximum speed limit for truck speed limiters to 80 km/h and using the speed information stored by the tachograph to punish breaches of the speed limit. The SIAF considered the crash-worthiness of the front end of the bus to be insufficient in such a crash, but did not make any recommendations to improve the situation. Instead, Volvo reinforced the front of the body of its 9700 model on its own initiative in 2004.

==Trial==
On 31 May 2006, the Äänekoski District Court gave the truck driver a suspended sentence of three months&#x27; imprisonment for endangering traffic safety, 23 fatalities and three injuries. In addition, the transport company Transpoint was fined a community fine of EUR 10,000 for an occupational safety offense.

The trial continued on 18 December 2006 in the Vaasa Court of Appeal, as the truck driver appealed against the verdict. A few interested parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict of the Äänekoski District Court, but none of them ultimately appealed.

On 23 January 2007, the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court&#x27;s decision largely unchanged. The truck driver did not appeal the verdict to the Supreme Court of Finland, so the verdict of the Court of Appeal remained final.

<doc id="541916" wikidata="Q3741406" url="?curid=541916" title="Gustav von Ewers">
<text>Johann Philipp Gustav von Ewers or Evers (27 July 1779 – 20 November 1830) was a German legal historian and the founder of Russian legal history as a scholarly discipline.

Ewers was a farmer’s son from the village of Amelunxen (now a part of Beverungen) in the Bishopric of Paderborn. He first studied theology and then political science at the University of Göttingen.

His first employment, as was customary for a graduate from a poor background, was as a private tutor. This brought him to the Imperial Russian province of Livonia, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. While teaching, he pursued his scholarly interests, especially regarding Russian political and legal history, which became one of his main fields of study – one indeed of which he is often regarded the founder.

Influenced by the Hegelian definition of society and state, he described the traditional tribal structure of Russia as the foundation of Russian statehood, most notably in this 1826 monograph &quot;Das älteste Recht der Russen&quot;. Evers&#x27; ideas have found a continued reception among Russian legal theorists.

On the basis of his publications, he was offered in 1810 the Chair of History, Statistics, and Geography of the Russian State at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu) in what is today Estonia. He occupied that chair until 1826, when he transferred to the law faculty. In 1816, Ewers declined an offer of the Chair of Political Economy at the newly founded University of Berlin. In the same year, he had become Prorector of the University of Dorpat and in 1818, Rector, to which office he was re-elected every year until his death at Dorpat in 1830, aged 51.

<doc id="541925" wikidata="Q122044" url="?curid=541925" title="Lubango">
<text>Lubango, formerly known as Sá da Bandeira, is a municipality in Angola, capital of the Huíla Province, with a population of 914,456 in 2022. The city center had a population of 600,751 in 2014 making it the second-most populous city in Angola after the capital city Luanda.

== History ==

===Portuguese rule===

In 1882 approximately one thousand Portuguese settlers came from the island of Madeira to the area of current-day Lubango. These Portuguese farmers helped develop the region and founded the settlement. The city, originally established in 1885 to serve colonists from the Madeira Islands, lies at an elevation of 1,760 metres in a valley of the Huíla Plateau and was surrounded by a scenic park spreading up the mountain slopes.

By 1910 there were over 1,700 ethnic Portuguese living in the settlement, which was referred to as &quot;Lubango&quot;. By 1923 the Moçâmedes Railway had connected the settlement to the town of Moçâmedes in the coast. The Portuguese government made it a city and renamed it &quot;Sá da Bandeira&quot;, after Bernardo de Sá, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira. Once the major centre of Portuguese settlement, it was built in a Portuguese style of architecture, with a cathedral, commerce hall, industrial hall, and a secondary school, and, like every Portuguese city or town in the mainland and the overseas territories, it would have the Portuguese town hall, the hospital and the typical CTT post office, besides banking (most prominently the Banco Nacional Ultramarino - BNU), insurance and other services as well. The city developed as a notable agricultural and transportation centre, with its own airport and railway station, as well as major maintenance and repair facilities for them.

Several Basters (children of African and Cape Colony Dutch descent) emigrated from Namibia to Angola and settled in Lubango, where they are known as the Ouivamo. Many of them were forced to return to Namibia between 1928 and 1930 by white South Africans.

In 1951, the Portuguese colony of Angola was officially rebranded the Overseas Province of Angola.

===Post independence===
After Angola&#x27;s Independence from Portugal due to the events of the April 25, 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, the city was once again renamed Lubango. During the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), Lubango served as a major base of Cuban, SWAPO and government troops. Its once thriving economy plummeted.

== Economy ==
Lubango&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture, especially meat products, cereals, sisal, tobacco, fruits and vegetables produced in the surrounding fertile region. Food processing, leather tanning, and consumer goods industries dominate the industrial sector.

A number of Angolan banks like BAI or BPC offer good financial services, and it is possible to receive funds from outside Angola by way of electronic fund transfer into these banks. ATMs are available around the city but they disburse kwanza, which is the local currency. In the markets US dollars or kwanza both are acceptable.

The main shopping plaza in Lubango is a newly built Mall called &quot;Milleneum&quot;, where most products of daily use as well as other products like cosmetics, shoes, clothes etc. are available.

== Transport ==

Lubango is the site of an airport (Lubango Airport IATA code:SDD) and headquarters for a fighter bomber regiment of the Angolan Air Force. The airport receives daily flights from Luanda and thrice a week from Windhoek, Namibia through TAAG, the Angolan airline.

The town is served by the Moçâmedes Railway, known as CFM. It is the junction for the branch railway to Chiange. Also the town is serviced by taxis (mostly shared) which run in circles around the city. One can hire personal taxis which are marked &quot;PARTICULAR&quot;. Walking around town is also a good way to explore Lubango. Bus services are available from Lubito and the buses run by a firm called &quot;SGO&quot; are pretty comfortable.

== Education and science ==
Lubango is home to two public higher education institutions, namely the Mandume ya Ndemufayo University and the Higher Institute of Education Sciences of Huíla.

The town has a Portuguese international school, the &quot;Escola Portuguesa do Lubango&quot; (&quot;Portuguese School of Lubango&quot;), and the &quot;Instituto Superior Politécnico Gregório Semedo&quot; (&quot;Gregório Semedo Polytechnical Institute&quot;) that offers degree courses in various disciplines.

== Climate ==
With an altitude of above sea level, Lubango is one of the highest places in Angola. The city features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate is hot and humid during the day and cool to cold at night, the annual average temperature is , though there are extremes of . June and July are cold when frosts are possible, albeit rare. The heaviest rains are between December and March and the warmest months are September and October.
The city is regarded as the coldest city in Angola, with registered temperatures of .

<doc id="541927" wikidata="Q546003" url="?curid=541927" title="The BMJ">
<text>The BMJ is a fortnightly peer-reviewed medical journal, published by BMJ Group, which in turn is wholly-owned by the British Medical Association (BMA). &quot;The BMJ&quot; has editorial freedom from the BMA. It is one of the world&#x27;s oldest general medical journals. Previously called the British Medical Journal, the title was officially shortened to &quot;BMJ&quot; in 1988, and then changed to &quot;The BMJ&quot; in 2014. The journal is published by BMJ Publishing Group Ltd, a subsidiary of the British Medical Association (BMA). The current editor-in-chief of &quot;The BMJ&quot; is Kamran Abbasi, who was appointed in January 2022.

== History ==
The journal began publishing on 3 October 1840 as the &quot;Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; and quickly attracted the attention of physicians around the world through its publication of high-quality original research articles and unique case reports. The &quot;BMJ&quot;″s first editors were P. Hennis Green, lecturer on the diseases of children at the Hunterian School of Medicine, who also was its founder, and Robert Streeten of Worcester, a member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association council.
The first issue of the &quot;Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; (&quot;PMSJ&quot;) was 16 pages long and contained three simple woodcut illustrations. The longest items were the editors&#x27; introductory editorial and a report of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association&#x27;s Eastern Branch. Other pages included a condensed version of Henry Warburton&#x27;s medical reform bill, book reviews, clinical papers, and case notes. There were columns of advertisements. Inclusive of stamp duty it cost 7d, a price that remained until 1844. In their main article, Green and Streeten noted that they had &quot;received as many advertisements (in proportion to the quantity of letter press) for our first number, as the most popular Medical Journal [&quot;The Lancet&quot;], after seventeen years of existence.&quot;

In their introductory editorial and later statements, Green and Streeten defined &quot;the main objects of promotion of which the &quot;Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; is established&quot;. Summarized, there were two clear main objectives: the advancement of the profession, especially in the provinces, and dissemination of medical knowledge. Green and Streeten also expressed an interest in promoting public well-being, as well as maintaining &#x27;medical practitioners, as a class in that rank of society which, by their intellectual acquirements, by their general moral character, and by the importance of the duties entrusted to them, they are justly entitled to hold&#x27;.

In April 1842 the journal was retitled the &quot;Provincial Medical Journal and Retrospect of the Medical Sciences&quot;, but two years later it reverted to the &quot;PMSJ&quot; under the sole editorship of Streeten. In 1857 the &quot;BMJ&quot; first appeared, when the &quot;PMSJ&quot; was merged with the &quot;Associated Medical Journal&quot; (Volumes 1–4; 1853–1856), which had itself evolved from the &quot;London Medical Journal&quot; (Volumes 1–4; 1849–1852) under the editorship of John Rose Cormack.

&quot;The BMJ&quot; published the first centrally randomized controlled trial. The journal also carried seminal papers on the causal effects of smoking on health and lung cancer and other causes of death in relation to smoking.

For a long time, the journal&#x27;s sole competitor was &quot;The Lancet&quot;, also based in the UK, but with increasing globalization, &quot;The BMJ&quot; has faced tough competition from other medical journals, particularly &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; and the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association,&quot; now known as JAMA.

In 1980, the journal split in two parts - &quot;British medical journal (Clinical research edition)&quot; [ISSN 0267-0623] and &quot;British medical journal (Practice observed edition)&quot; [ISSN 0267-0631].

== Journal content ==
&quot;The BMJ&quot; is an advocate of evidence-based medicine. It publishes research as well as clinical reviews, recent medical advances, and editorial perspectives, among others.

A special &quot;Christmas Edition&quot; is published annually on the Friday before Christmas. This edition is known for research articles which apply a serious academic approach to investigating less serious medical questions. The results are often humorous and widely reported by the mainstream media.

&quot;The BMJ&quot; has an open peer review system, in which authors are told who reviewed their manuscript. About half of all submitted articles are rejected without external review. Manuscripts chosen for peer review are then reviewed by external experts, who comment on the importance of the work and its suitability for publication, before the final decision on a manuscript is made by the editorial (&quot;hanging&quot;) committee, so called because of its similarity to committees that decide which works of art should be hung in an exhibition. The acceptance rate is less than 7% for original research articles.

At the beginning of February 2021, &quot;The BMJ&quot; introduced a charge of £299 for publishing obituaries. This was widely criticized on social media, by the British Medical Association among others, because of the large number of medical staff being killed by COVID-19. The decision was explained, but reversed, by the end of the month.

===Rapid Recommendations===
In response to the many problems with traditional medical guidelines, the journal introduced &quot;BMJ Rapid Recommendations&quot;, a series of trustworthy guidelines focused on the most pressing medical problems.

===Rapid Responses===
&quot;The BMJ&quot; publishes most e-letters to the journal on its website under the heading Rapid Responses, organized as a fully moderated Internet forum. Comments are screened for unacceptable content, such as libel or obscenity, and contributors may not remove or edit contributions once they have been published. 88,500 rapid responses had been posted on the BMJ&#x27;s website.

== Indexing and citations ==
&quot;The BMJ&quot; is included in the major indexes PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, and the Science Citation Index. The journal has long criticized the misuse of impact factors to award grants and in the recruitment of researchers by academic institutions.

The five journals that cited &quot;The BMJ&quot; most often in 2008 were (in order of descending citation frequency) &quot;The BMJ&quot;, the &quot;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews&quot;, &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;BMC Public Health&quot;, and &quot;BMC Health Services Research&quot;. In the same year the five journals most often cited in articles published in &quot;The BMJ&quot; were &quot;The BMJ&quot;, &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; and the &quot;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews&quot;.

== Impact ==
In the 2023 &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; &quot;The BMJ&#x27;s&quot; impact factor was reported to be 93.7. ranking it 3rd among general medical journals. However, &quot;The BMJ&quot; in 2013 reported that it had become a signatory to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (commonly known as the Dora Agreement), which deprecates the inappropriate use of journal impact factors and urges journal publishers to &quot;greatly reduce the emphasis on the journal impact factor as a promotional tool, ideally by ceasing to promote the impact factor or by presenting it in the context of a variety of journal-based metrics.&quot;

== Cello scrotum hoax article ==
In 1974, Elaine Murphy submitted a brief case report under her husband&#x27;s name John which suggested a condition known as &quot;cello scrotum&quot;, a fictional condition that supposedly affected male cellists. It was originally submitted as a joke in response to &quot;guitar nipple&quot;, a condition similar to jogger&#x27;s nipple in which some forms of guitar playing causes irritation to the nipple, which Murphy and her husband believed was also a joke. The case report was published in &quot;The BMJ,&quot; and although not widely cited, it was cited occasionally, often by sceptics, because, for example, &quot;when the cello is held in typical playing position, the body of the instrument is not near the scrotum.&quot;

In 2009, 35 years after the original case report was published, Murphy wrote a letter to &quot;The BMJ&quot; revealing that the report had been a hoax.

== Website and access policies ==
&quot;The BMJ&quot; went fully online in 1995 and archived all its issues on the World Wide Web. In addition to the print content, the site contains supporting material for original research articles, additional news stories, and electronic letters to the editors.

In 1999, all content of &quot;The BMJ&quot; was made freely available online; however, in 2006 this changed to a subscription model. Original research articles continue to be available free, but from January 2006 all other &quot;added value&quot; contents, including clinical reviews and editorials, require a subscription. &quot;The BMJ&quot; allows complete free access for visitors from economically disadvantaged countries as part of the HINARI initiative.

In October 2008 &quot;The BMJ&quot; announced that it would become an open access journal for research articles. A subscription continued to be required for access to other articles.

== Editions ==
&quot;The BMJ&quot; is principally an online journal, and only the website carries the full text content of every article. However, print editions are produced, targeting different groups of readers with selections of content, some of it abridged, and different advertising. The print editions are:
* &quot;General Practice&quot; (weekly) for general practitioners
* &quot;Clinical Research&quot; (weekly) for hospital doctors

<doc id="541941" wikidata="Q1470970" url="?curid=541941" title="JAMA">
<text>JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association) is a peer-reviewed medical journal published 48 times a year by the American Medical Association. It publishes original research, reviews, and editorials covering all aspects of biomedicine. The journal was established in 1883 with Nathan Smith Davis as the founding editor. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo of the University of California San Francisco became the journal editor-in-chief on July 1, 2022, succeeding Howard Bauchner of Boston University.

According to &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal&#x27;s 2024 impact factor is 63.1, ranking it 4th out of 168 journals in the category &quot;Medicine, General &amp; Internal&quot;.

== History ==
The journal was established in 1883 by the American Medical Association and superseded the &quot;Transactions of the American Medical Association&quot;. &quot;Councilor&#x27;s Bulletin&quot; was renamed the &quot;Bulletin of the American Medical Association&quot;, which later was absorbed by the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;. In 1960, the journal obtained its current title, &quot;JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;. The journal is commonly referred to as &quot;JAMA&quot;.

== Continuing medical education ==
&quot;Continuing Education Opportunities for Physicians&quot; was a semiannual journal section providing lists for regional or national levels of continuing medical education (CME). Between 1937 and 1955, the list was produced either quarterly or semiannually. Between 1955 and 1981, the list was available annually, as the number of CME offerings increased from 1,000 (1955) to 8,500 (1981). In 2016, CME transitioned into a digital offering from the JAMA Network called JN Learning CME &amp; MOC from JAMA Network. JN Learning provides CME and MOC credit from article and audio materials published within all 12 JAMA Network journals, including &quot;JAMA&quot;.

==Publication of article by Barack Obama==
On 11 July 2016, &quot;JAMA&quot; published an article by Barack Obama entitled &quot;United States Health Care Reform: Progress to Date and Next Steps&quot;, which was the first academic paper ever published by a sitting U.S. president. The article was not subject to blind peer-review. It argued for specific policies that future presidents could pursue in order to improve national health care reform implementation.

== Policy shift ==
After the controversial 1999 firing of an editor-in-chief, George D. Lundberg, a process was put in place to ensure editorial freedom. A seven-member journal oversight committee was created to evaluate the editor-in-chief and to help ensure editorial independence. Since its inception, the committee has met at least once a year. Presently, &quot;JAMA&quot; policy states that article content should be attributed to authors, not to the publisher.

===Artwork===
From 1964 to 2013, &quot;JAMA&quot; used images of artwork on its cover and it published essays commenting on the artwork. According to former editor George Lundberg, this practice was designed to link the humanities and medicine. In 2013, a format redesign moved the art feature to an inside page, replacing an image of the artwork on the cover with a table of contents. The purpose of the redesign was to standardize the appearance of all journals in the JAMA Network.

== Racism controversy ==
On a February 2021 JAMA podcast a Deputy Editor of the journal proposed that &quot;structural racism is an unfortunate term to describe a very real problem&quot; and that &quot;taking racism out of the conversation would help&quot; to ensure &quot;all people who lived in disadvantaged circumstances have equal opportunities to become successful and have better qualities of life.&quot; In addition to the comments made during the podcast, JAMA then tweeted out the podcast with the caption &quot;No physician is racist, so how can there be structural racism in health care&quot; which further added to the controversy. The comments were immediately criticized by some, resulting in deletion of the podcast and resignation of the Deputy Editor. On June 1, 2021, the editor-in-chief announced that he would resign effective June 30, 2021 to &quot;create an opportunity for new leadership at JAMA.&quot; Columnists Eric Zorn and Daniel Henninger asserted in separate Op-Eds that the resignation of the two editors was an unfortunate substitute for meaningful conversations about racism and health care, and the episode was highlighted as a case study of social media, polarization, and radicalization in Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;The Canceling of the American Mind&quot;.

<doc id="541950" wikidata="Q360084" url="?curid=541950" title="Juri Lotman">
<text>Juri Lotman (; 28 February 1922 – 28 October 1993), a prominent Russian-Estonian literary scholar, semiotician, and historian of Russian culture, worked at the University of Tartu. He was elected a member of the British Academy (1977), the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1987), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1989) and the Estonian Academy of Sciences (1990). He was a founder of the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School. The number of his printed works exceeds 800 titles. His extensive archive (now kept at the University of Tallinn and at the Tartu University Library) includes his correspondence with a number of Russian and Western intellectuals.

==Biography==
Juri Lotman was born in the Jewish intellectual family of lawyer Mikhail Lotman and Sorbonne-educated dentist Aleksandra Lotman in Petrograd, Russia. His elder sister Inna Obraztsova graduated from Leningrad Conservatory and became a composer and lecturer of musical theory, his younger sister Victoria Lotman was a prominent cardiologist, and his third sister Lidia Lotman was a scholar of Russian literature of the second half of the 19th century on staff at the Institute for Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Science (Pushkin House) (she lived in Saint-Petersburg).

Lotman graduated from the secondary school in 1939 with excellent marks and was admitted to Leningrad State University without having to pass any exams. There he studied philology, which was a choice he made due to Lidia Lotman&#x27;s university friends (actually he attended university lectures in philology whilst he was still at secondary school). His professors at university were the renowned lecturers and academicians Gukovsky, Azadovsky, Tomashevsky and Propp. He was drafted in 1940 and during World War II served as a radio operator in the artillery. Demobilized from the army in 1946, he returned to his studies in the university and received his diploma with distinction in 1950. His first published research papers focused on Russian literary and social thought of the 18th and 19th century.

Lotman moved to the Estonian SSR in 1950, where he started teaching Russian literature while working on his dissertation (aspirantura), which he defended at the Leningrad State University in 1952. In 1954 he was appointed docent in the Department of Russian literature of Tartu University, eventually becoming head of the department. In 1961 he defended his doctoral dissertation, also at the Leningrad State University, and the following year achieved the rank of professor.

In the early &#x27;60s Lotman established academic contacts with a group of structuralist linguists in Moscow, and invited them in the first Summer School on Secondary Modeling Systems, that took place in Kääriku from 19th to 29 August 1964. The group gathered at the first summer school later developed into what is now known as the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School. Among participants of the summer school, and later members of the Tartu–Moscow school, were such names as Boris Uspensky, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, Mikhail Gasparov, Alexander Piatigorsky, Isaak I. Revzin and Georgii Lesskis. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework for the study of the semiotics of culture.

This school has been widely known for its journal &quot;Sign Systems Studies&quot;, published by Tartu University Press (&quot;Труды по знаковым системам&quot;) and currently the oldest semiotics journal in the world (established in 1964). Lotman studied the theory of culture, Russian literature, history, semiotics and semiology (general theories of signs and sign systems), semiotics of cinema, arts, literature, robotics, etc. In these fields, Lotman has been one of the most widely cited authors. His major study in Russian literature was dedicated to Pushkin; among his most influential works in semiotics and structuralism are &quot;Semiotics of Cinema&quot;, &quot;Analysis of the Poetic Text&quot; and &quot;The Structure of the Artistic Text&quot;. In 1984, Lotman coined the term semiosphere.
In 1991 he received the Gold Medal of Philology, the highest award for a philological scholar.

Juri Lotman&#x27;s wife Zara Mints was also a well-known scholar of Russian literature and Tartu professor. They have three sons:
*Mihhail Lotman (born 1952) is professor of semiotics and literary theory at Tartu University, is active in politics and has served as a member of the Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament) as a member of the conservative Res Publica Party.
*Grigori Lotman (born 1953) is an artist.
*Aleksei Lotman (born 1960) is a biologist, since 2006 he has also been a politician and a member of parliament for the Estonian Greens party (2007–2011).

<text>Lysozyme (, muramidase, &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase; systematic name peptidoglycan &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramoylhydrolase) is an antimicrobial enzyme produced by animals that forms part of the innate immune system. It is a glycoside hydrolase that catalyzes the following process:

: Hydrolysis of (1→4)-β-linkages between &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine residues in a peptidoglycan and between &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine residues in chitodextrins

Peptidoglycan is the major component of gram-positive bacterial cell wall. This hydrolysis in turn compromises the integrity of bacterial cell walls causing lysis of the bacteria.

Lysozyme is abundant in secretions including tears, saliva, human milk, and mucus. It is also present in cytoplasmic granules of the macrophages and the polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Large amounts of lysozyme can be found in egg white. C-type lysozymes are closely related to α-lactalbumin in sequence and structure, making them part of the same glycoside hydrolase family 22. In humans, the C-type lysozyme enzyme is encoded by the &quot;LYZ&quot; gene.

Hen egg white lysozyme is thermally stable, with a melting point reaching up to 72 °C at pH 5.0. However, lysozyme in human milk loses activity very quickly at that temperature. Hen egg white lysozyme maintains its activity in a large range of pH (6–9). Its isoelectric point is 11.35. The isoelectric point of human milk lysozyme is 10.5–11.

== Function and mechanism ==

The enzyme functions by hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds in peptidoglycans. The enzyme can also break glycosidic bonds in chitin, although not as effectively as true chitinases.

Lysozyme&#x27;s active site binds the peptidoglycan molecule in the prominent cleft between its two domains. It attacks peptidoglycans (found in the cell walls of bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria), its natural substrate, between &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and the fourth carbon atom of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG).

Shorter saccharides like tetrasaccharide have also shown to be viable substrates but via an intermediate with a longer chain. Chitin has also been shown to be a viable lysozyme substrate. Artificial substrates have also been developed and used in lysozyme.

=== Mechanism ===

==== Phillips ====
The Phillips mechanism proposed that the enzyme&#x27;s catalytic power came from both steric strain on the bound substrate and electrostatic stabilization of an oxo-carbenium intermediate. From X-ray crystallographic data, Phillips proposed the active site of the enzyme, where a hexasaccharide binds. The lysozyme distorts the fourth sugar (in the D or -1 subsite) in the hexasaccharide into a half-chair conformation. In this stressed state, the glycosidic bond is more easily broken. An ionic intermediate containing an oxo-carbenium is created as a result of the glycosidic bond breaking. Thus distortion causing the substrate molecule to adopt a strained conformation similar to that of the transition state will lower the energy barrier of the reaction.

The proposed oxo-carbonium intermediate was speculated to be electrostatically stabilized by aspartate and glutamate residues in the active site by Arieh Warshel in 1978. The electrostatic stabilization argument was based on comparison to bulk water, the reorientation of water dipoles can cancel out the stabilizing energy of charge interaction. In Warshel&#x27;s model, the enzyme acts as a super-solvent, which fixes the orientation of ion pairs and provides super-solvation (very good stabilization of ion pairs), and especially lower the energy when two ions are close to each other.

The rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism is related to formation of the oxo-carbenium intermediate. There were some contradictory results to indicate the exact RDS. By tracing the formation of product (p-nitrophenol), it was discovered that the RDS can change over different temperatures, which was a reason for those contradictory results. At a higher temperature the RDS is formation of glycosyl enzyme intermediate and at a lower temperature the breakdown of that intermediate.
==== Covalent mechanism ====

In an early debate in 1969, Dahlquist proposed a covalent mechanism for lysozyme based on kinetic isotope effect, but for a long time the ionic mechanism was more accepted. In 2001, a revised mechanism was proposed by Vocadlo via a covalent but not ionic intermediate. Evidence from ESI-MS analysis indicated a covalent intermediate. A 2-fluoro substituted substrate was used to lower the reaction rate and accumulate an intermediate for characterization. The amino acid side-chains glutamic acid 35 (Glu35) and aspartate 52 (Asp52) have been found to be critical to the activity of this enzyme. Glu35 acts as a proton donor to the glycosidic bond, cleaving the C-O bond in the substrate, whereas Asp52 acts as a nucleophile to generate a glycosyl enzyme intermediate. The Glu35 reacts with water to form hydroxyl ion, a stronger nucleophile than water, which then attacks the glycosyl enzyme intermediate, to give the product of hydrolysis and leaving the enzyme unchanged. This type of covalent mechanism for enzyme catalysis was first proposed by Koshland.

More recently, quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations have been using the crystal of HEWL and predict the existence of a covalent intermediate. Evidence for the ESI-MS and X-ray structures indicate the existence of covalent intermediate, but primarily rely on using a less active mutant or non-native substrate. Thus, QM/MM molecular dynamics provides the unique ability to directly investigate the mechanism of wild-type HEWL and native substrate. The calculations revealed that the covalent intermediate from the covalent mechanism is ~30 kcal/mol more stable than the ionic intermediate from the Phillips mechanism. These calculations demonstrate that the ionic intermediate is extremely energetically unfavorable and the covalent intermediates observed from experiments using less active mutant or non-native substrates provide useful insight into the mechanism of wild-type HEWL.
=== Inhibition ===
Imidazole derivatives can form a charge-transfer complex with some residues (in or outside active center) to achieve a competitive inhibition of lysozyme. In Gram-negative bacteria, the lipopolysaccharide acts as a non-competitive inhibitor by highly favored binding with lysozyme.

=== Non-enzymatic action ===
Despite that the muramidase activity of lysozyme has been supposed to play the key role for its antibacterial properties, evidence of its non-enzymatic action was also reported. For example, blocking the catalytic activity of lysozyme by mutation of critical amino acid in the active site (52-Asp -&gt; 52-Ser) does not eliminate its antimicrobial activity. The lectin-like ability of lysozyme to recognize bacterial carbohydrate antigen without lytic activity was reported for tetrasaccharide related to lipopolysaccharide of &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;. Also, lysozyme interacts with antibodies and T-cell receptors.

=== Enzyme conformation changes ===
Lysozyme exhibits two conformations: an open active state and a closed inactive state. The catalytic relevance was examined with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN) field effect transistors (FETs), where a singular lysozyme was bound to the SWCN FET. Electronically monitoring the lysozyme showed two conformations, an open active site and a closed inactive site. In its active state lysozyme is able to processively hydrolyze its substrate, breaking on average 100 bonds at a rate of 15 per second. In order to bind a new substrate and move from the closed inactive state to the open active state requires two conformation step changes, while inactivation requires one step.

=== Superfamily ===
The conventional C-type lysozyme is part of a larger group of structurally and mechanistically related enzymes termed the &quot;lysozyme superfamily&quot;. This family unites GH22 C-type (&quot;chicken&quot;) lysozymes with plant chitinase GH19, G-type (&quot;goose&quot;) lysozyme GH23, V-type (&quot;viral&quot;) lysozyme GH24 and the chitosanase GH46 families. The lysozyme-type nomenclature only reflects the source a type is originally isolated from and does not fully reflect the taxonomic distribution. For example, humans and many other mammals have two G-type lysozyme genes, LYG1 and LYG2.

== Role in disease and therapy ==

Lysozyme is part of the innate immune system. Reduced lysozyme levels have been associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns. Piglets fed with human lysozyme milk can recover from diarrheal disease caused by &quot;E. coli&quot; faster. The concentration of lysozyme in human milk is 1,600 to 3,000 times greater than the concentration in livestock milk. Human lysozyme is more active than hen egg white lysozyme. A transgenic line of goats (with a founder named &quot;Artemis&quot;) were developed to produce milk with human lysozyme to protect children from diarrhea if they can&#x27;t get the benefits of human breastfeeding.

Since lysozyme is a natural form of protection from Gram-positive pathogens like &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, it plays an important role in immunology of infants in human milk feeding. Whereas the skin is a protective barrier due to its dryness and acidity, the conjunctiva (membrane covering the eye) is, instead, protected by secreted enzymes, mainly lysozyme and defensin. However, when these protective barriers fail, conjunctivitis results.

In certain cancers (especially myelomonocytic leukemia) excessive production of lysozyme by cancer cells can lead to toxic levels of lysozyme in the blood. High lysozyme blood levels can lead to kidney failure and low blood potassium, conditions that may improve or resolve with treatment of the primary malignancy.

Serum lysozyme is much less specific for diagnosis of sarcoidosis than serum angiotensin converting enzyme; however, since it is more sensitive, it is used as a marker of sarcoidosis disease activity and is suitable for disease monitoring in proven cases.

== Chemical synthesis ==

The first chemical synthesis of a lysozyme protein was attempted by Prof. George W. Kenner and his group at the University of Liverpool in England. This was finally achieved in 2007 by Thomas Durek in Steve Kent&#x27;s lab at the University of Chicago who made a synthetic functional lysozyme molecule.

== Other applications ==
Lysozyme crystals have been used to grow other functional materials for catalysis and biomedical applications. Lysozyme is a commonly used enzyme for lysing gram positive bacteria. Due to the unique function of lysozyme in which it can digest the cell wall and causes osmotic shock (burst the cell by suddenly changing solute concentration around the cell and thus the osmotic pressure), lysozyme is commonly used in lab setting to release proteins from bacterium periplasm while the inner membrane remains sealed as vesicles called the spheroplast.

For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; can be lysed using lysozyme to free the contents of the periplasmic space. It is especially useful in lab setting for trying to collect the contents of the periplasm. Lysozyme treatment is optimal at particular temperatures, pH ranges, and salt concentrations. Lysozyme activity increases with increasing temperatures, up to 60 degrees Celsius, with a pH range of 6.0-7.0. The salts present also affect lysozyme treatment, where some assert inhibitory effects, and others promote lysis via lysozyme treatment. Sodium chloride induces lysis, but at high concentrations, it is an active inhibitor of lysis. Similar observations have been seen with the use of potassium salts. Slight variations are present due to differences in bacterial strains. A consequence of the use of lysozyme in extracting recombinant proteins for protein crystallization is that the crystal may be contaminated with units of lysozyme, producing a physiologically irrelevant combination. In fact, some proteins simply cannot crystalize without such contamination.

Furthermore, lysozyme can serve as a tool in the expression of toxic recombinant proteins. Expressing recombinant proteins in BL21(DE3) strains is typically accomplished by the T7-RNA-polymerase. Via IPTG induction, the UV-5 repressor is inhibited, leading to the transcription of the T7-RNA-polymerase and thereby of the protein of interest. Nonetheless, a basal level of the T7-RNA-polymerase is observable even without induction. T7 lysozyme acts as an inhibitor of the T7-RNA-polymerase. Newly invented strains, containing a helper plasmid (pLysS), constitutively co-express low levels of T7 lysozyme, providing high stringency and consistent expression of the toxic recombinant protein.

== History ==

The antibacterial property of hen egg white, due to the lysozyme it contains, was first observed by Laschtschenko in 1909. The bacteria-killing activity of nasal mucus was demonstrated in 1922 by Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, who coined the term &quot;lysozyme&quot;. He is reported as saying: &quot;As this substance has properties akin to those of ferments I have called it a &#x27;Lysozyme&#x27;.&quot; Fleming went on to show that an enzymic substance was present in a wide variety of secretions and was capable of rapidly lysing (i.e. dissolving) different bacteria, particularly a yellow &quot;coccus&quot; that he studied&quot;.

Lysozyme was first crystallised by Edward Abraham in 1937, enabling the three-dimensional structure of hen egg white lysozyme to be described by David Chilton Phillips in 1965, when he obtained the first 2-ångström (200 pm) resolution model via X-ray crystallography. The structure was publicly presented at a Royal Institution lecture in 1965.
Lysozyme was the second protein structure and the first enzyme structure to be solved via X-ray diffraction methods, and the first enzyme to be fully sequenced that contains all twenty common amino acids.
As a result of Phillips&#x27; elucidation of the structure of lysozyme, it was also the first enzyme to have a detailed, specific mechanism suggested for its method of catalytic action. This work led Phillips to provide an explanation for how enzymes speed up a chemical reaction in terms of its physical structures. The original mechanism proposed by Phillips was more recently revised.

<doc id="541959" wikidata="Q317593" url="?curid=541959" title="Ladislaus of Naples">
<text>Ladislaus the Magnanimous (, ; 15 February 1377 – 6 August 1414) was King of Naples from 1386 until his death and an unsuccessful claimant to the kingdoms of Hungary and Croatia. Ladislaus was a skilled political and military leader, protector and controller of Pope Innocent VII; however, he earned a bad reputation concerning his personal life. He profited from disorder throughout Italy to greatly expand his kingdom and his power, appropriating much of the Papal States to his own use. He was the last male of the Capetian House of Anjou.

==Youth==
Ladislaus was born in Naples on 15 February 1377 during the reign of his great aunt Queen Joanna I of Naples. He was the son of Charles and Margaret of Durazzo, both members of the Capetian House of Anjou. His parents, having lived for years at the court of their kinsman King Louis I of Hungary, named him after King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary. In 1379 his father declared war on Joanna and proclaimed himself king with the backing of Pope Urban VI. Fearing that Joanna would take her as hostage, Margaret fled with Ladislaus to her castle in Morcone. They returned to Naples on 11 September 1381, after Charles prevailed over Joanna. On 5 November Charles invested Ladislaus with the Duchy of Calabria, traditionally held by the heir apparent.

Ladislaus became King of Naples at the age of nine (1386) under his mother&#x27;s regency after his father was assassinated while pursuing his claim to the throne of Hungary. At the time the kingdom saw a rebellion of the barons (fomented by Pope Urban VI), and there was a risk of a French invasion, since in 1385 the pope had assigned the throne to Louis II of Anjou, Count of Provence. Urban VI refused to recognize Ladislaus, and in 1387 called a crusade against him. Margaret and her son at the time controlled not much more than Naples and its neighborhood. After turmoil broke out in the city, they fled to the fortress of Gaeta, while Naples was occupied by an Angevin army led by Otto of Brunswick, widower of Joanna I of Naples, who had named Louis&#x27; father as her heir.

In 1389 the new Pope Boniface IX recognized Ladislaus as King of Naples, although he forbade him to unite it with his family lands in Germany and Italy. In Gaeta, Ladislaus married Costanza Chiaramonte, the daughter of the powerful Sicilian baron, Manfredi Chiaramonte. Within a few years the marriage was annulled.

In 1390, the archbishop of Arles poisoned Ladislaus, and though he survived, he subsequently stuttered and was forced to take repeated periods of rest. Also in 1390, Louis II invaded Naples, starting a war with Ladislaus lasting nine years. Ladislaus limited Louis&#x27; control to the city of Naples and the Terra d&#x27;Otranto. In 1399, while Louis was fighting against the Count of Lecce, Ladislaus regained the city of Naples with the support of several powerful barons of the kingdom, including Raimondo Del Balzo Orsini. Louis of Anjou then decided to return to the County of Provence. Ladislaus spent the year 1400 subduing Onorato Caetani, count of Fondi, and the last rebellions in Abruzzo and Apulia.

==Claim to Hungary==

In 1401 Ladislaus married Mary of Lusignan, daughter of the King of Cyprus. She arrived in Naples in 1402. In the same period, Ladislaus tried to restore Angevin rule in Hungary and Croatia, where some of the nobles opposed King Sigismund. Between 1403 and 1414, Ladislaus ordered the painting of a cycle of the &quot;Legend of Saint Ladislaus&quot; in the church of Santa Maria dell&#x27;Incoronata in Naples. In these paintings, the Hungarian king is depicted receiving the royal crown, fighting against the pagans, and receiving the crown of Croatia. (The cult of Saint Ladislaus and other Hungarian kings was already present in Naples and other Italian regions since the second half of the 13th century, thanks to Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, who brought them when she married Charles II of Naples.)

Considering himself the heir of the kings of Hungary, Ladislaus tried many times to obtain the crown of Hungary. He also proclaimed himself Duke of Slavonia, a title with no basis. He first negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Venice, ceding the island of Corfu. He thus obtained free passage in the Adriatic Sea and, with the partial support of the Pope, landed at Zadar on 19 July 1403. On 5 August 1403, while in the town of Zara, Ladislaus was crowned king of Hungary and Croatia by János Kanizsai, archbishop of Esztergom, in the presence of the papal legate, Cardinal Angelo Acciajuoli. Even after his coronation, the rule of Ladislaus in Croatia and Hungary never extended beyond Dalmatia. His father grew up in Hungary governing Croatia as viceroy, and eventually became king. However, Ladislaus remained inactive, and returned to Apulia; his authority in Dalmatia remained restricted to little more than the city of Zara. The following year, after the death of Boniface IX, he intervened in Rome in support of the Colonna family, two days after the election of the new pope, Innocent VII.

==Conquest of central Italy==
Aspiring to the brilliant prestige and might of his imperial forbearer in southern Italy, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, Ladislaus was determined to conquer central Italy and extend his power into Tuscany and farther north. Ladislaus endeavored to consolidate Neapolitan royal power at the expense of the barons, and brought about the murders of several members of the Sanseverino family for frustrating his ends. In 1405, he went again to Rome. When some nobles offered him the lordship of the city, the Pope responded by deposing him as King of Naples on 9 January 1406. The Pope had incited Raimondo Del Balzo Orsini to rebel, but he died soon after. His wife, Mary of Enghien, continued the rebellion and successfully defended Taranto against a two-month long siege by Ladislaus in the spring of 1406. She did not surrender even after Ladislaus and the Pope signed a treaty of peace in July, by which Ladislaus became the protector of the Papal States. He moved to Taranto again early in 1407, this time with diplomatic intentions. Since his second wife had died in 1404, Ladislaus solved the matter of Taranto by marrying Mary of Enghien on 23 April 1407.

In 1407, trying to taking advantage of the feebler personality of the new pope, Gregory XII, Ladislaus invaded the Papal States and conquered Ascoli Piceno and Fermo. In 1408, he besieged Ostia to prevent a success of the French party in the schism between Gregory XII and Antipope Benedict XIII. After a short siege, he captured the city by bribing the Papal commander, Paolo Orsini, and entered Rome on 25 April. Later, Perugia also fell into his hands.

In 1409, Ladislaus sold his rights to Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 ducats. This was part of his attempts to gain allies in the upcoming war against the Republic of Florence, caused by his expansion in central Italy and his alliance with Paolo Guinigi, lord of Lucca, a traditional enemy of the Florentines. Ladislaus invaded Tuscany, capturing Cortona and the island of Elba from Gherardo Appiani. Florence hired the condottiere Braccio da Montone, who defeated Ladislaus, and he was forced to retreat. However, he had not abandoned his aims in northern Italy, and took advantage of the presence of Pope Gregory XII in Gaeta.

Fearing his aims, the Republics of Siena and Florence and the powerful cardinal Baldassarre Cossa allied against him. Antipope Alexander V excommunicated him, and called Louis II of Anjou back to Italy to conquer Naples. Louis arrived in late July 1409 with 1,500 cavalry and was invested with the Neapolitan crown. The allies&#x27; troops, under Muzio Attendolo, Braccio da Montone and other condottieri, invaded the Papal lands under Ladislaus&#x27; control and moved to Rome; Orsini, left by Ladislaus to protect the city, defected to them with 2,000 men. However, the allies captured only the Vatican and the Trastevere quarter. Cardinal Cossa and Louis left the siege to their condottieri, and moved to northern Italy and Provence in search of further support.

Ladislaus took advantage of an anti-French revolt in Genoa to gain the support of that city (1410). Rome fell on 2 January, and the allies did not score any other notable results. On 16 or 17 May May, Louis&#x27; fleet, carrying new troops from Provence, was intercepted and partly destroyed off the Tuscan coast, with the loss of 6,000 men and Louis&#x27; treasure (for a value of 600,000 ducats), which fell into the hands of Ladislaus. In the meantime, Alexander had died, being replaced by Cossa himself as John XXIII. John XXIII proclaimed a crusade against Ladislaus and authorised the sale of indulgences to finance it.

The slow pace of the allied army led the Florentines and Sienese to accept peace with Ladislaus, which he bought by renouncing some of his Tuscan conquests. Louis continued the struggle: his army, led by Muzio Attendolo, crushed the Neapolitan army at Roccasecca on 19 May 1411. He was unable to exploit this success, as he could not breach the defensive line that Ladislaus had set up at San Germano. Louis soon returned to Rome and Provence, where he died six years later. In 1412, the situation turned more favorable to Ladislaus: his condottiere Carlo I Malatesta occupied part of the March of Ancona, and, above all, Muzio Attendolo joined Ladislaus. A peace was eventually signed on 14 June 1412, by which the Antipope paid 75,000 florins, invested Ladislaus with the Neapolitan crown and named him as Gonfalonier of the Church. Ladislaus promised in turn to abandon the cause of Gregory XII, who was ousted from Gaeta and moved to Rimini.

==Last campaigns and death==

The peace was only a means to gain time for both John XXIII, who did not want to pay the 75,000 florins, and Ladislaus, who feared intervention in Italy by Sigismund of Hungary. After Florence initiated diplomatic contacts with Sigismund, Ladislaus marched northwards in mid-May 1413. On 8 June, his troops conquered and sacked Rome, after which he went into Umbria and northern Latium. As it was clearly his next objective, Florence forestalled him by signing a treaty, which recognized Ladislaus&#x27; conquest of the Papal States (only Todi and Bologna had not fallen).

Having fallen ill in July 1414, Ladislaus was forced to return to Naples, where he died on 6 August 1414. Rumours that he had been poisoned remain unproven: it is more likely that he fell ill due to an infection to his genitals. He is buried in the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara, where a monument was built over his tomb. He was succeeded by his sister, Joanna II, the last member of the senior Angevin line in Italy.

==Marriages and issue==
Ladislaus married three times:
*First to Costanza Chiaramonte in 1390. She was a daughter of Manfredi III Chiaramonte. After the impoverishment of the Chiaramonte family, the marriage was annulled in 1392.
*Second to Mary of Lusignan (1381–1404) on 12 February 1403 in Naples. She was a daughter of James I of Cyprus. She died on 4 September 1404.
*Third to Mary of Enghien (1367 or 1370 – 9 May 1446), &quot;suo iure&quot; Countess of Lecce, daughter of John of Enghien, in 1406. She survived him by thirty-two years. 

Plus, in 1393, he agreed to marry Erhundi Hatun, a daughter of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I in exchange for help against Sigismund of Hungary, but the marriage did not materialize due to the rejection of the clause providing for the princess&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. 

There were no children from any of his marriages. However Ladislaus had at least two illegitimate children:
*Reynold of Durazzo, Titular &quot;Prince of Capua&quot;, buried in Foggia. Married and had children of his own:
**Francis of Durazzo. Married and had a son:
***Reynold di Durazzo (1469 – 1 September 1494 and buried in Foggia), married to Camilla Tomacelli, without issue
**Catherine of Durazzo
**Camilla of Durazzo
**Hippolyta of Durazzo
*Mary of Durazzo, who died young

<text>The Open University of Israel (, &quot;Ha-Universita ha-Ptuha&quot;) is a distance-education university in Israel. It is one of ten public universities in Israel recognized by the Council of Higher Education (CHE). 

Open University teaching methods are based primarily on distance learning technologies, with the option of face-to-face tutorial sessions. Campuses are located in Ra&#x27;anana, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Beersheba, Givat Haviva, and Nazareth, in addition to approximately fifty study centers located throughout the country. Most students study remotely from their homes in Israel and around the world. As in other higher education institutions, graduation from the OUI is contingent upon successfully fulfilling degree requirements; English-language proficiency is also required. The university offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, as well as a number of master&#x27;s degree programs, and a doctoral program in Education: Technologies in Learning Systems. Acceptance requirements to master&#x27;s programs are similar to those at most universities.

==History==


In 1971, a committee appointed by the CHE and chaired by Professor Shneior Lifson proposed the establishment of an open university, following the model of the Open University UK. The Edmond de Rothschild Foundation (Israel) endorsed the idea and offered to fund its establishment, based on the recommendation of a committee of experts chaired by Professor Wilbur Schramm of Stanford University. The proposal was introduced to the Minister of Education and Culture at the time, Yigal Allon. Under his leadership, in 1973, the government and the CHE decided to establish a “university for all.” In 1988 the university changed its name from Everyman&#x27;s University to The Open University of Israel.
In 1976, the Open University began operating from its headquarters in Ramat Aviv, with an enrollment of 2,267 students. Five courses were initially offered. The university had 130 employees, including nine senior academic faculty members and 31 teaching faculty (including course coordinators and tutors). 
An agreement signed in 1995 between the university and the Ra’anana municipality led to construction of the Dorothy de Rothschild campus. In 2004, construction was completed and university headquarters were relocated to the new main campus in Ra’anana.

==Academics==

===Academic departments===
The Open University has seven academic departments:
* History, Philosophy and Judaic Studies
* Language, Literature, and the Arts
* Mathematics and Computer Science
* Natural and Life Sciences
* Management and Economics
* Sociology, Political Science, and Communication
* Education and Psychology

===Study method===
Studies towards a degree at the Open University are structured on a course-by-course basis, rather than year-by-year or program based, as in traditional universities. All courses are designed for independent study, using textbooks and online learning materials produced specifically for the OUI. Course websites feature additional study materials, technological aids, and forums for consulting with academic faculty and other students. Students have the option of attending in-person or online tutorials for review of study material.
Course coordinators manage all aspects of the courses they teach, including assignment and exam development, and monitoring of course websites. Tutors review material in weekly or bi-weekly tutorials and grade assignments.

===Study programs===
Courses are clustered into study programs. In order to graduate, students must accumulate the full credits required for a degree (usually 120 credits). The OUI offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, doctoral, and diploma study programs. Students may pursue a general undergraduate degree in the humanities or social sciences, or a degree in a specific discipline. In most disciplines, degrees are either single or dual-disciplinary. Currently, the OUI offers one PhD program.

===Transfer tracks===
A credit transfer program, in conjunction with other top Israeli universities, allows students to begin their studies at the OUI without admission requirements and demonstrate scholastic success. Students who successfully complete a cluster of OUI courses (according to specific study program requirements), are generally accepted as transfer students to any traditional university in Israel.

==The Research Authority==
The Dean of Research heads the Research Authority (RA) and the OUI research institutes, and oversees research ethics.
The RA helps facilitate the presentation of research proposals to competitive funding bodies and the publication of research studies in journals and other scholarly publications. The RA manages research budgets, physical infrastructure, and personnel. It formulates agreements with other academic institutions to host OUI researchers who require specialized research infrastructure not available at the OUI, and advances partnerships between OUI researchers and colleagues in other universities.
A steering committee composed of five senior faculty members and headed by the dean of research operates alongside the RA.

===OpMop Ltd.===
OpMop Ltd., founded in 2008, is a technology transfer subsidiary of the OUI that files patents for OUI faculty members and assists with all intellectual property matters related to research and technology development.

===Research institutes===
OUI research institutes provide a framework for interdisciplinary research in a variety of fields, and forge reciprocal and cross-departmental collaborations. The centers provide support for researchers as they generate new scientific knowledge, and foster collaboration and programming with colleagues in Israel and abroad.

===Institute for Policy Analysis===
The Institute for Policy Analysis promotes research on theoretical, empirical, and applied subjects related to policy design and implementation, and social, political, and economic processes and mechanisms. The institute focuses on policy analysis and contemporary social issues.

===Research Center for Innovation in Learning Technologies===
The Research Center for Innovation in Learning Technologies explores the integration of new educational technologies in study methods. The center encourages research by OUI faculty aimed at improving the understanding of teaching and learning processes in technology-rich environments, and the integration of innovative technologies in the teaching of academic courses, particularly at the OUI. The center works in close cooperation with the Shoham Center for Technology in Distance Education.

===The Institute for the Study of Relations between Jews, Christians, and Muslims===
The institute supports research groups and organizes events related to topics of interest to the public that enhance the understanding and relationship between the three Abrahamic religions.

===Astrophysics Research Center (ARCO)===
The center functions as a scientific, institutional, and applied hub for the research of theoretical, observational, and empirical topics and issues in astrophysics, including cosmology, relativist gravity and planetary science.

===Open Media and Information Lab (OMILab)===
OMILab serves as a base for multidisciplinary digital projects. It facilitates partnerships between researchers from different disciplines, such as sociology, computer science, management, communications, education, psychology, and digital humanities.

==Academic Development and Publishing==
The Academic Development and Publishing Department manages and monitors course development from start to finish, and publishes course books and related materials. Development is carried out in teams composed of faculty members, pedagogic and technological advisors, editors, graphic designers, film directors, and scriptwriters.
The OUI publishes under two imprints: Lamda Scholarship, and Lamda Books.
Lamda Scholarship was founded in 2013 as a platform for publishing innovative research-based Hebrew books in the humanities and social sciences. The university provides comprehensive peer-review, editing and design services. 
Lamda Scholarship secures publishing grants for selected books from various foundations, and is a member of the Israeli Association of Book Publishers.
Lamda Books publishes OUI textbooks which are sold in commercial bookstores countrywide, as well as online and in the Ra’anana campus bookstore. The books serve OUI students as well as students in other academic institutions throughout Israel.

===Journals===
The OUI publishes two Hebrew-language academic journals, Kriot Yisraeliot (Israeli readings) is a digital, multidisciplinary journal which focuses on empirical and theoretical issues relevant to Israeli society and Zmanim., is a history quarterly, co-published with Tel Aviv University and the Historical Society of Israel.

==The Shoham Center for Technology in Distance Education==
The Shoham center develops and implements technology-based pedagogic solutions for producing and teaching courses. Some of the realms of development include the OPAL online learning environment, online exam systems, assistance in exam design, learning analytics, state-of-the-art video studios for live broadcasts, and educational video production and filmed courses.

==Resource Development and External Relations==
The resource development and external relations department develops relationships with donors in Israel and abroad, and fundraises for OUI programs and scholarships. The American Friends of the Open University of Israel was formed in the early 1980s. In 2017, the Israeli and British associations of Friends of the Open University were founded in Israel.
In 2018, Friends associations were founded in France and Switzerland. The university has also benefited from Latin American support since 2017.

==Students==
More than 50,000 students are currently enrolled in the Open University. In addition to a typical student population, the OUI also attracts under-resourced communities, due to its flexible study system and focus on student support. The OUI is popular with mature students who combine studies with full-time employment, high school students, who take university courses in lieu of high school matriculation courses through the Academia in High School program, and conscripts combining university studies with military service. In addition, the university has support systems in place to assist students studying from abroad, and students with disabilities.

===Student Association===
The Open University&#x27;s student association provides services and activities in order to improve the university experience of its diverse student population. The association&#x27;s academic department has instituted several projects to support students in their studies. The scholarship and social engagement department promotes volunteering in non-profit organizations such as the SAHAR mental health association, and the LATET organization for humanitarian aid. The association tailors its efforts to the needs of the student body.

==External studies==
The External Studies Center offers inservice training, and enrichment and professional development in a variety of fields.

<text>The &quot;Lion&quot; class were a pair of battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy before World War I. Nicknamed the &quot;Splendid Cats&quot;, the ships were a significant improvement over their predecessors of the in speed, armament and armour. These improvements were in response to the German battlecruisers of the , which were in turn larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers of the .

 served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s battlecruisers throughout World War I. She sank the German light cruiser during the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and participated in the battles of Dogger Bank in 1915 and Jutland the following year. She was so badly damaged at the Battle of Dogger Bank that she had to be towed back to port. During the Battle of Jutland, &quot;Lion&quot; suffered a serious cordite fire that could have destroyed the ship.

Her sister ship, , also played a role in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, and was then sent south to the Caribbean to intercept the German East Asia Squadron in case they used the Panama Canal. After the squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS). During the Battle of Dogger Bank, she scored only a few hits, but one crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; became the flagship of the 1st BCS and participated in the Battle of Jutland. Both ships were present during the inconclusive Action of 19 August 1916.

The sisters spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea; they provided distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. In 1920, they were put into reserve and were then sold for scrap a few years later in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.

== Design and description ==

The acceleration of the German naval building programme in 1907–1908 forced H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Liberal Government to yield to public pressure and authorise more ships for the 1909–1910 Construction Programme. Only a single battleship and a battlecruiser had been authorised in 1908–1909, but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorised in 1909–1910 with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as contingency ships to placate the public and the Admiralty. Continuing pressure forced the government to announce in July 1909 that the contingency ships would also be built. This pressure also allowed the Admiralty to gain approval to improve the size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over the new German dreadnoughts then under construction.

The &quot;Lion&quot;-class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the &quot;Moltke&quot; class as the German ships were to the &quot;Invincible&quot; class. The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 40% increase in size over the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class and made them the largest warships in the world. Their layout was adapted from the design of the first &quot;super-dreadnought&quot; class, the s of 1910, with 13.5-inch (343 mm) guns. The ships were the first battlecruisers to be armed with the new 13.5-inch Mk V gun. The design of the &quot;Lions&quot; remedied some of the shortcomings of the preceding battlecruisers, which suffered from an inability of the &quot;en echelon&quot; amidships turrets to safely fire across the deck, limiting them to a three-turret broadside. This was done because the greater size and weight of the new guns rendered wing turrets impracticable. As such, all four turrets in the &quot;Lion&quot;s were arranged on the centreline; &#x27;Q&#x27; turret was located amidships and could only fire on the broadside. The Director of Naval Construction, Sir Philip Watts, suggested that a fifth turret, superfiring over the rear turret, could be added if the ship was lengthened by three frames, in total, and that this would add very little cost other than the £175,000 for the additional turret but add 25% more firepower to the ship. This was not approved, possibly because of doubts about its feasibility.

=== General characteristics ===

The &quot;Lion&quot;s were significantly larger than their predecessors of the . They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They displaced at normal load and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. They had a metacentric height of at deep load.

=== Propulsion ===
The &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships were equipped with two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts. Their three-bladed propellers were in diameter on the inner shafts and those on the outer shafts were in diameter. The turbines, rated at , used steam provided by forty-two Yarrow boilers that operated at a pressure of . &quot;Lion&quot; did not reach her designed speed of during her sea trials despite exceeding , but &quot;Princess Royal&quot; achieved . The ships carried of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, they could steam for at a speed of .

=== Armament ===
The &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships mounted eight BL 13.5-inch Mark V guns in four twin hydraulically powered gun turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;. Unlike the two previous classes of battlecruiser in the Royal Navy, which had turrets fore, aft and on each side of the ship, the &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships had their main armament mounted in a single line from front to rear, with &#x27;B&#x27; turret superfiring over &#x27;A&#x27; turret, &#x27;Q&#x27; turret mounted amidships, and &#x27;Y&#x27; turret aft. The guns had elevation ranges from −3° to +20°; their gunsights were limited to +15° until super-elevating prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at +20° elevation, they had a range of . Their rate of fire was two rounds per minute. The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

The secondary armament of the &quot;Lion&quot; class consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns, most of which were mounted in casemates in single mounts. The guns had maximum elevations of +15°, which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at muzzle velocities of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. The ships were fitted with two submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside.

=== Fire control ===
The main guns were controlled from the conning tower. Data from a Argo rangefinder located on top of the conning tower was input into a Mk I Dreyer Fire-Control Table located in the transmitting station (TS) below the conning tower where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets were provided with nine-foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via a pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. &quot;Lion&quot; received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.

=== Armour ===
The armour protection given to the &quot;Lion&quot;s was heavier than that of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s; their waterline belt of Krupp Cemented Armour measured thick amidships in contrast to the belt of their predecessors. It thinned to 4 inches towards the ships&#x27; ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. They were also given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of 6 inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast the end turrets. The ends of the armoured citadel were closed off by 4-inch transverse bulkheads. Nickel-steel plating was used for the protective decks. The lower armoured deck was generally only thick except outside the citadel where it was . The upper armoured deck was situated at the top of the upper armour belt and was also only 1 inch thick. The forecastle deck armour ranged from .

The gun turrets had 9-inch fronts and sides and their roofs were thick. The barbettes were protected by 9 inches of armour above the deck, thinning to above the upper armour deck and below it. The sides of the conning tower were thick and it had a three-inch roof and communication tube. Nickel-steel torpedo bulkheads thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. Their funnel uptakes were protected by nickel-steel splinter armour thick on the sides and 1 inch on the ends between the upper and forecastle decks. After the Battle of Jutland revealed their vulnerability to plunging shellfire, 1 inch of additional armour, weighing approximately , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs.

== Construction ==
Only &quot;Lion&quot; was completed to the original design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, &quot;Lion&quot; before being commissioned, and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower at the rear of the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.

== Modifications ==
The &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships were built without anti-aircraft (AA) guns, but a variety of weapons were fitted over the course of the war. These included the quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder (57 mm) Hotchkiss gun on a High Angle (HA) Mk Ic mounting that had a maximum elevation of 60°. Each ship was fitted with one in October 1914, but &quot;Lion&quot;″s gun was removed in July 1915, and &quot;Princess Royal&quot;″s was removed in December 1916. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . QF 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt AA guns on high-angle Mk II mounts were also used that had an elevation range between -10° and +90°. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a maximum ceiling of . &quot;Lion&quot; received a pair of these weapons in 1915 and retained them for the rest of the war. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was fitted with one gun in January 1915 and it was removed in April 1917. She received two 4-inch Mark VII guns on HA Mk II mounts capable of 60° of elevation in April 1917 and a pair of single 2-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-poms&quot; were added in April 1919. They fired shells weighing at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of . Their cyclic rate of fire was 200 rounds per minute; the actual rate was significantly less.

The pole foremast was modified to a tripod after 1916. This was due to the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; received searchlight towers on the aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the aft battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and &quot;Lion&quot; was fitted with a torpedo control station at the aft end of her aft superstructure.

== Service ==
=== Pre-war career ===
Upon commissioning, both &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; were assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in January 1913, of which &quot;Lion&quot; became the flagship. Rear-Admiral David Beatty assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913. The sisters, along with the rest of the 1st BCS, made a port visit to Brest in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June.

=== World War I ===
==== Battle of Heligoland Bight ====
The first action for &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Beatty&#x27;s ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sand bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary. The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when the battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;Cöln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly to his front. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk. The battlecruisers encountered the crippled &quot;Cöln&quot; shortly after turning north and she was sunk by &quot;Lion&quot; after a few salvoes.

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; was detached in November to reinforce the North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons in the search for Admiral Graf Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron after it destroyed the West Indies Squadron of Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock during the Battle of Coronel. She returned home the next month after the German ships had been sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.

==== Raid on Scarborough ====

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast aiming to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. The Germans did not know that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey; they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty&#x27;s 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including &quot;Lion&quot;, as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Hipper set sail on 15 December for another raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet in the early morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, but he turned in pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty&#x27;s ships passed to the north while the 2nd Battle Squadron passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. They spotted a German cruiser a few minutes later and Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships, thinking they were the advance screen for Hipper&#x27;s ships. Those were 50 km (31 mi) behind. Another British communications failure allowed the German light cruisers to escape and they alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and escaped.

==== Battle of Dogger Bank ====

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. The British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers. Contact was initiated the following morning when &quot;Arethusa&quot; spotted the German light cruiser and the Germans spotted Beatty&#x27;s force a few minutes later. Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to &quot;Blücher&quot;″s maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, &quot;Lion&quot;, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; and , were doing in pursuit and &quot;Lion&quot; opened fire at very long range. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves about 20 minutes later and concentrated their fire on &quot;Lion&quot;. and combined their fire to cripple &quot;Lion&quot; over the next hour even though &quot;Princess Royal&quot; engaged &quot;Derfflinger&quot; during this period. Another signalling failure caused the British ships to focus on sinking &quot;Blücher&quot; when Beatty intended most of his ships to continue the pursuit of the battlecruisers. During this time &quot;Princess Royal&quot; hit &quot;Blücher&quot; at least twice, including the hit that crippled her and allowed the other British ships to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze. He then transferred to a destroyer and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before &quot;Blücher&quot; sank and boarded &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. Beatty ordered the pursuit of the German battlecruisers resumed, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking &quot;Blücher&quot; and that Hipper&#x27;s ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. &quot;Lion&quot; was headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her. Later that afternoon, the battlecruiser was ordered to take &quot;Lion&quot; under tow. It took almost two days to reach port. The ship was under repair for the next three months and did not rejoin the fleet until 7 April. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was not damaged during the battle.

==== Battle of Jutland ====

On 31 May 1916, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was the flagship of the 1st BCS, under the command of Rear-Admiral Osmond Brock. The squadron had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, led by Beatty in &quot;Lion&quot;, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the British ships to their west by mid-afternoon and turned about to fall back on the German battleships, then about behind him. Beatty turned to cut him off but was out of position to do that and had to settle for a pursuit. This began what was to be called the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course. The Germans opened fire first, three minutes later, followed almost immediately afterward by the British. The sisters were in the lead and were engaged by their opposite numbers, the battlecruisers, and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. Fire from both German ships was very accurate, and both &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; were hit twice within three minutes of the Germans&#x27; opening fire.

&quot;Lion&quot; scored her first hit on &quot;Lützow&quot; two minutes later, but one of &quot;Lützow&quot;″s 305 mm (12 in) shells hit &#x27;Q&#x27; turret at 16:00. It blew the front roof and the centre face plates off the turret, killed or wounded everyone inside, and started a fire that continued to smoulder despite efforts to put it out. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the propellant charges in the turret working room at 04:28. They burnt violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded, sinking the ship, if it had not already been flooded. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. After confirming the sighting himself, Beatty ordered his ships to turn around and fall back upon the oncoming Grand Fleet. During the Run to the South. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was hit a total of six times by &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, but none of them were serious.
&quot;Lion&quot; was hit twice more, during what came to be called the &quot;Run to the North&quot;, after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty&#x27;s ships slowly moved out of range and rendezvoused with the main body of the Grand Fleet. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre. By 18:35 Beatty was following the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Beatty then turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast to search for Hipper&#x27;s ships.
Scheer finally disengaged around 19:15 and the British lost sight of the Germans until 20:05 when the light cruiser spotted smoke bearing west-northwest. Ten minutes later she closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. Shortly after 20:30 the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve&#x27;s II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans were able to fire only a few rounds in reply because of the poor visibility and turned away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 20:40. After this Beatty changed course to south-southeast and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course.
&quot;Lion&quot;, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June where &quot;Lion&quot; began repairs that lasted until 19 July. The remains of &#x27;Q&#x27; turret were removed during this period and not replaced until a visit to Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick that lasted from 6 to 23 September. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; began repairs that lasted until 10 June. She sailed later that day for Devonport Royal Dockyard where more permanent repairs were made and was back at Rosyth by 21 July.

==== Post-Jutland career ====

&quot;Lion&quot; rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty&#x27;s flagship, on 19 July. On the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland the following day, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake the Germans then turned for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home, the British having lost two cruisers to submarine attacks and the Germans having a dreadnought battleship damaged by a torpedo.
&quot;Lion&quot; became the flagship of Vice-Admiral W. C. Pakenham in December 1916 when he assumed command of the Battlecruiser Fleet upon Beatty&#x27;s promotion to command of the Grand Fleet. &quot;Lion&quot; had an uneventful time for the rest of the war conducting patrols of the North Sea as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but did not come within range of any German forces. &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. When the High Seas Fleet sailed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 to be interned, &quot;Lion&quot; was among the escorting ships. Along with the rest of the 1st BCS, &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; guarded the interned ships until both ships were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919.

&quot;Lion&quot; was placed in reserve in March 1920, paid off on 30 March 1922, and sold for scrap on 31 January 1924 for £77,000. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was placed in reserve in 1920 and an attempt to sell her to Chile in mid-1920 was unsuccessful. She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922, but was sold for scrap in December 1922. Both ships were scrapped to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty.

<text>Lezhë (, ) is a city in the Republic of Albania and seat of Lezhë County and Lezhë Municipality. It is one of Albania&#x27;s oldest continuously inhabited cities, with roughly 2,400 years of recorded history.

One of the main strongholds of the Labeatai, the earliest of the fortification walls of Lezhë are of typical Illyrian construction and are dated to the late 4th century BC. Lezhë was one of the main centres of the Illyrian kingdom. During the conflicts with Macedon, it was captured by Philip V becoming the Macedonian outlet to the Adriatic Sea. The city was later recovered by the Illyrians. It was subjected to Rome after the Roman-Illyrian wars and the fall of Gentius&#x27; realm. Lezhë was the site of the League of Lezhë where Skanderbeg united the Albanian lords in the fight against the Ottoman Empire.

== Name ==

The city is mentioned in ancient sources as &quot;Lissós&quot; (Ancient Greek: Λισσός) and &quot;Lissus&quot; (Latin: &quot;Lissus&quot;, &quot;Lissum&quot;). It is also attested in numismatic material. The &quot;ethnicon&quot; ΛΙΣΣΙΤΑΝ &quot;Lissitan&quot; is found on coin inscriptions of the Hellenistic era. It is considered a Greek toponym, deriving from the Greek λισσός&#x27;lissós&quot;, meaning &#x27;smooth, smooth rock, gruff&#x27;.

The ancient name &quot;Lissus&quot; evolved into its modern form &quot;Lezhë&quot; (archaic: &quot;Lesh&quot;) through Albanian sound changes. In Turkish, the town is known as &quot;Leş&quot; or &quot;Eşim&quot; and in Italian as &quot;Alessio&quot;. Lezhë is also known as &quot;Alise&quot;, &quot;Alexiensis&quot;, &quot;Eschenderari&quot;, or &quot;Mrtav&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

From the early Mycenaean period (1600-1450 BC) a free exchange pattern is confirmed with the centres of Mycenaean Greece as seen by various swords (C and D type) unearthed in Lezhë. The earliest human constructions have an Illyrian character and appear on the site from the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. The settlement with its fortifications was built on a 413-metre-high mountain, the &quot;Mal i Shëlbuemit&quot;, from at least the 8th century BC, and was located near the mouth of the Drin river.


In antiquity the area was described as the territory of the Illyrii tribe (the &quot;Illyrians proper&quot;; , &quot;Illyrioi&quot;; or &quot;Illyrii propriae dicti&quot;).

Diodorus (&quot;Library&quot;, 15.1, 1st century BC) mentions that Dionysius of Syracuse founded a &quot;city called &quot;Lissos&quot;&quot; in the year 385 BC, as part of a strategy by Dionysius to secure Syracusan trade routes along the Adriatic. Diodorus calls it a polis. It has been suggested that the Syracusan colony mentioned by Diodorus was in fact more likely established at Issa near the island of Pharos, not at Lissus (modern Lezhë) which was too distant for the events described by the ancient historian. Meanwhile, Issa is known from other evidence to be a Syracusan foundation. Except Diodorus&#x27; account there is nothing to connect Lissos with Syracuse, and according to Pierre Cabanes even if Diodorus&#x27; account is accepted as accurate, it is very likely that this colony had a short life.

The earliest of the fortification walls of the proto-urban settlement are of typical Illyrian construction and are dated to the late 4th century BC. The transition from the Iron Age fortification of Acrolissus (on the 413 m &quot;Shëlbuem&quot; mountain) to the proper Illyrian city of Lissus was continuous. The city was built on a lower hill (172 m) near the Iron Age fortification. It was surrounded by ramparts that faced the low valley of the Drin river and the sea coast. Its function was to guard the route inland, to ensure defense against possible attacks from the sea, and to furnish a secure anchorage for the Illyrian ships.
By the 3rd century BC, Lissus was one of the main cities of the Illyrian kingdom under the Ardiaean and Labeatan dynasties. In the 228 BC peace treaty with Rome, the Illyrian queen Teuta promised not to sail south of Lissus at the mouth of the Drin river with more than two &quot;lembi&quot; (Illyrian light ships), even those had to be unarmed. But when Rome was engaged in a war against the Celtic peoples of the Po Valley in northern Italy about the years 225–222 BC, Illyrian commander Demetrius detached the Atintani tribe from their alliance with Rome. Moreover, he sailed south of Lissus and engaged in piracy in violation of the 228 BC peace treaty. In the summer of 221 BC, tensions in Greece increased as Macedonia allied with the Achaean League against the Aetolian League, and the Illyrians attacked in their typical manner. Demetrius and Scerdilaidas sailed with 90 &quot;lembi&quot; south of Lissus. When they failed an assault on Pylos (western Peloponnese), they separated their fleets and Scerdilaidas returned north with 40 ships, while Demetrius plundered the Cyclades with 50 ships.

In Roman times Lissus was located in a territory inhabited by the Labeatae, however ancient sources never relate it with this tribe. Taking in account archaeological and historical considerations, the city of Lissus should have been founded in a Labeatan context, but perhaps by the time of Teuta&#x27;s fall in the end of the 3rd century BC, on a Greek model it was organized as a &quot;polis&quot; turning away from its ethnic context. The dissociation from the ethnic to the &quot;polis&quot; coincided with Philip V of Macedon&#x27;s conquest of a number of cities in Illyria. In 211 BC, Philip V captured Acrolissus, the citadel of Lissus, and Lissos surrendered to him, becoming the Macedonian outlet to the Adriatic Sea. The town was later recovered by the Illyrians. It was in Lissus that Perseus of Macedon negotiated an alliance against Rome with the Illyrian king Gentius, and it was from Lissus that Gentius organized his army against the Romans. Lissus maintained a large degree of municipal autonomy under both Macedonian and Illyrian rule, as evidenced by the coins minted there. During the reign of Gentius in the first half of the 2nd century BC, Lissus minted coins for the Illyrian ruler. The city was of some importance in the Roman Civil War, being taken by Marc Antony and then remaining loyal to Caesar. In Roman times, the city was part of the province of Epirus Nova,

=== Middle Ages ===

During the reign of Justinian I (527-565) the local fortress was possibly mentioned as &quot;Alistion&quot; in the Synecdemus of Hierocles. At early 590s Lissus was captured by Slavic populations. Byzantine control was re-established during the early 9th century.

Albanian lord Vladislav Jonima of the Jonima family was acknowledged by the Pope as a ruler of a territory around Lezhë in 1319. He had the title of &quot;Count of Dioclea and of the seaside Albania&quot;. At the end of the 14th century, Albanian lord Dhimitër Jonima was lord of a territory between Mat and Lezhë.

In the Middle Ages, Lezha (known in Italian as Alessio) frequently changed masters until the Venetians took possession of it in 1386. It still belonged to them when Skanderbeg died, but In 1478 it fell into the hands of Turks during the siege of Shkodra, except for a short period (1501–1506) when it returned to Venetian domination. Because it was under the Venetian control, it was chosen in 1444 by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg as a neutral place for the convention of Albanian nobles and lords of the area aiming at organizing their common defence against the Turks.

Lezha was the site of the League of Lezhë where Skanderbeg united the Albanian princes in the fight against the Ottoman Empire.

Skanderbeg was buried in the cathedral of Lezhë which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas and later used as Selimie Mosque.

<doc id="541992" wikidata="Q3428685" url="?curid=541992" title="Public health journal">
<text>A public health journal is a scientific journal devoted to the field of public health, including epidemiology, biostatistics, and health care (including medicine, nursing and related fields). Public health journals, like most scientific journals, are peer-reviewed. Public health journals are commonly published by health organizations and societies, such as the &quot;Bulletin of the World Health Organization&quot; or the &quot;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&quot; (published by the British Medical Association). Many others are published by a handful of large publishing corporations that includes Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer Science+Business Media, and Informa, each of which has many imprints (which are brands named after former independent publishers that were merged or acquired). Many societies partner with such corporations to handle the work of producing their journals.

The increase in public health research in recent decades has seen a rapid increase in the number of articles and journals. As such, many public health journals have emerged with a specialized focus, such as in the area of policy (e.g. &quot;Journal of Public Health Policy&quot;), a specific region or country of the world (e.g. &quot;Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health&quot;, &quot;Pan American Journal of Public Health&quot; or &quot;Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal&quot;), a specific intervention/practice area (e.g. &quot;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention&quot;), or other particular focus (e.g. &quot;Human Resources for Health&quot;).

== Scope ==
Public health journals often indicate their target audience as being interdisciplinary, including health care professionals, public health decision-makers and researchers. A main objective is to support evidence-based policy and evidence-based practice in public health. In contrast, medical journals (e.g. &quot;The Lancet&quot;) typically focus on reaching medical professionals as their main audience, although the boundaries between these two categories are increasingly blurry.

It has been argued that some medical and public health journals are &quot;filled with increasingly complex science&quot; which depends upon advanced statistics and research methods that health care providers may have difficulty understanding. In response they have turned towards publishing &quot;articles that are more journalism than science&quot; such as reviews, news, and educational material. However, science is what attracts major attention and leads institutions and libraries to purchase subscriptions.

== Review process ==

For an article to be accepted for publication in a public health or medical journal it must typically undergo a review process. Each journal creates its own process, but they have certain common characteristics in general. There are various general &quot;levels&quot; of scrutiny, which have some effect on the respect given to articles published in the journals. Some broad categories might be &quot;editorial review&quot;, &quot;peer review&quot;, and &quot;blind peer review&quot;. Richard Smith, former editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, stated in 2006 that studies had found peer review to be ineffective and prone to abuse, but noted that editors consider it invaluable.

=== Editorial review ===
In this process, articles which meet the minimum requirements for submission (such as including the necessary descriptions of funding, privacy and publication releases, ethics/institutional review board approval, statements of original work, signatures of authors, and so on,) are first looked over by a managing editor or a member of an editorial board. They may be referred back to the authors for revision and resubmission, rejected, or presented to the editorial board for final approval.

=== Peer review ===
A more stringent review process includes a full peer review. After first review by a managing editor or member of an editorial board, an article which has good possibilities will be sent out for review by two or more researchers in the specific area. If these reviews are positive the article may be referred back to the authors to address any comments by the reviewers, or (rarely) may be accepted immediately by the editorial board.

==== Blind peer review ====
One common review process is the same as the peer review above, except all references to the authors are removed from the article before review by the researchers.

==Content==
Most public health journals include various types of content, such as:
* Editorial
* Letter to the Editor
* Original research 
* Literature review, systematic review and meta-analysis
* Abstracts from scientific meetings or other journals
* Technical notes

Medical journals may also include, for example, case reports and clinical images of interest. Some online journals are also moving to publishing video content (e.g. &quot;Journal of Visualized Experiments&quot;).

==Internet and open access==

By the early 21st century, most public health and medical journals were available online, thus increasing their accessibility worldwide. There is a general move from print as primary medium to electronic publication, an example being the online journals published by BioMed Central.

With the advent of online publication, some health journals are transforming from traditional subscription-based and pay-per-view access to open access for some or all of their content.

==Impact factor==

Like other scientific journals, many public health journals are ranked with an impact factor, linked to the probability of an article published in that journal being cited. It is currently accepted that a higher impact factor indicates a better journal quality, at least in some health disciplines.

Journals with high impact factors according to the Journal Citation Reports in the category &quot;Public, Environmental and Occupational Health&quot; include: &quot;Environmental Health Perspectives&quot;, &quot;American Journal of Epidemiology&quot;, &quot;Annual Review of Public Health&quot;, &quot;Genetic Epidemiology&quot;, &quot;Epidemiologic Reviews&quot;, &quot;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Epidemiology&quot;, &quot;Epidemiology&quot;, &quot;Bulletin of the World Health Organization&quot; and &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot;.

In addition, given their interdisciplinary nature, some journals with a public health focus may be found in other categories. For example, &quot;Human Resources for Health&quot; is placed in the category &quot;industrial relations and labor&quot;, where it was ranked 1st in 2012.

<doc id="541993" wikidata="Q190897" url="?curid=541993" title="Fier">
<text>Fier (; , Latin: &quot;Fierum&quot;) is the seventh most populous city of the Republic of Albania and seat of Fier County and Fier Municipality. It is situated on the bank of Gjanica River in the Myzeqe Plain between the Seman in the north, the Vjosë in the south and the foothills of the Mallakastra Mountains in the southeast. Fier experiences a seasonal Mediterranean climate affected by its proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the west.

Fier was founded in the 19th century by the Vrioni family and officially in 1864 by Omer Pasha Vrioni II, the father of Kahreman Pasha Vrioni (1889-1955). It is from the ruins of the ancient settlement of Apollonia which was founded in 588 BCE by Ancient Greek colonists from Corfu and Corinth, on a site occupied by Illyrian tribes.

Fier is an important terminus in southwestern Albania and is served by the A2 motorway and SH 4 highway, forming a north–south corridor in Albania and part of the Adriatic–Ionian motorway.

== Name ==

The word &quot;Fier&quot; is claimed to derive from the Albanian word &quot;&quot;, which is claimed to mean &quot;fern&quot;. Naming locations after the local flora is a common phenomenon amongst the Myzeqar Albanians. Another alternative hypothesis proposes a derivation from the Italian word &quot;&quot;, translated as &quot;trade fair&quot;.

== History ==

The history of Fier is bound up with that of the oil, gas and bitumen deposits nearby. The presence of asphalt and burning escapes of natural gas in the vicinity was recorded as early as the 1st century AD. Dioscorides, in Materia Medica, describes lumps of bitumen in the adjacent river Seman, and the concentrated pitch on the banks of the Vjosë river Strabo, writing in about AD 17 states:

On the territory of the people of Apolonia in Illyria there is what is called a nymphaeum. It is a rock which emits fire. Below it are springs flowing with hot water and asphalt... the asphalt is dug out of a neighbouring hill: the parts excavated are replaced by fresh earth, which in time is converted to asphalt.

In the 14th and 15th centuries the location was used by the Venetian traders as a marketplace to purchase agricultural products from the Myzeqe lowlands.

The settlement took city status in 1864 when Kahreman Pasha Vrioni, the local governor, asked from some French architects to project a future city as an artisan and trade centre. During the 1864–1865 period a market for 122 merchants was built along the Gjanica river. The first inhabitants of the city were the servants of Kahreman Pasha Vrioni and members of Aromanian families that had lived in the area since the early 19th century.

Six kilometres away from Fier is situated Apollonia, one of the two most important ancient Greek colonial settlements in present-day Albania. It was founded in ~600 BC on a hill near the sea, and near what was then the course of Vjosë river by Ancient Greek settlers from Corfu and Corinth. At the time before the changes in land formation and the Adriatic coastline caused by an earthquake in the 3rd century AD, the harbour af Apollonia could accommodate as many as 100 ships. The site was on the territory of Illyrian tribe of the Taulantii. The colony was said to have been named Gylaceia after its Corinthian founder, Gylax, and later changed its name to that of city of the God Apollo. According to archaeological investigations for 100 years Greek and Illyrian have lived in separate communities.

The economic prosperity of Apolonia grew on the basis of trade in slaves, and the local rich pastoral agricultural. In the middle of the 5th century BC, a workshop for minting coins was set up here. Through trade and commercial transactions these coins spread throughout Illyria and beyond its boundaries. In the years 214 BC onwards, the city was involved in the war between the Illyrian Taulantii and Cassander, the king of Macedonia, and in 229 BC came under Roman control. In 168 BC, its loyalty to Rome was rewarded. For 200 years, it was of central importance in the Roman effort to colonize the east and may have been an original terminus of the Egnatian Way. It was a vital stronghold for Caesar in the civil war between Pompey and Julius Caesar. In 45 and 44 BC, Octavian, later to become the Emperor Augustus, studied for 6 months in Apollonia, which had established a high reputation as a center of Greek learning, especially the art of rhetoric. It was noted by Cicero, in the Philippics, as &#x27;magna urbs et gravis&#x27; a great and important city.

Under the Empire, Apollonia remained a prosperous centre, but began to decline as the Vjosë silted up and the coastline changed after the earthquake.

Since the fall of communism construction has been taking place. In particular, an Orthodox church was reconstructed in 1999 that allows people to practice their religion.

== Geography ==

Fier is located on the bank of Gjanica in the southeast of the Myzeqe Plain between the Seman in the north and Vjosë in the south of Fier near the Adriatic Sea in southwestern Albania. The municipality of Fier is encompassed in the County of Fier within the Southern Region of Albania and consists of the adjacent administrative units of Cakran, Dërmenas, Frakull, Levan, Libofshë, Mbrostar, Portëz, Qendër, Topojë and Fier as its seat. It stretches from the mouth of Seman within the Divjakë-Karavasta National Park in the northwest across the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast until it reaches the mouth of Vjosë in the Vjosa-Narta Protected Landscape in the southwest, also forming the southern border of the municipality. The area of the municipality Fier is 619.9 km2.

=== Climate ===

Fier has a Mediterranean climate (Csa) under the Köppen climate classification with mild winters and hot, dry summers.

== Economy ==

Fier is an important industrial city and is built by the Gjanica tributary of the Seman River, and is surrounded by marshland. With nearby Patos town, it is the centre of the oil, bitumen and chemical industries in Albania. Fier additionally has been the home of power-generation in Albania with the construction of the Fier Power Plant during the communist era. Although it was decommissioned in 2007, a joint Greek-Albanian venture was announced in 2023 to revitalize these thermal plants to diversify Albania’s electrical industry.

Fier is a convenient place to stay to visit the major Classical sites at nearby Byllis and Apollonia. Main roads from the central square lead south to Vlora () and east to the oil and industrial town of Patos ().
Also, to the west of the city centre, one will find the picturesque Seman Beach.

Fier is also known for its olive trees production (Kalinjioti cultivar) which contributes to the olive oil sector of Albania. Together with Vlora, Berat and Elbasan they provide almost 90% of olive oil production.

The city also plays an important economic role in the development of the county since it produces many goods such as sugar, bread and animal products.

The creation of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline raises the economy of Fier and Albania highly. The pipe line will be crossing Fier and a Pumping Station will be built in Fier. This shows an open road to investment and employment 
of the city and country. The Pipe line has started since 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2020. This will Supply Albania Natural Gas.

=== Transport ===
There are Urban Buses available throughout the city. There are also buses at the bus terminal in Fier that can take you throughout places in Albania and Balkan region. Fier is served by Fier railway station. There used to be trains during the communism era and till this day there has been no movement of the trains. The SH4 is a state road that takes you from Durrës to Fier. The SH8 is also a state road that will take you from Fier to Vlorë. There is a project for the Fier and Vlorë highway.

== Demography ==

<text>Peshkopi (; , Latin: &quot;Penestae&quot;) is a town located in the mountainous regions of northeastern Albania, in Dibër County. It is the capital of both the county () and the district () of Dibër, and is the only county regional capital in Albania which does not share its name with its county. The population as of the 2023 census is 14,710.

Peshkopi lies east of the Black Drin river, about northeast of Tirana, the capital of Albania, and from the Macedonian border. The town sits above sea level. 

Known for its thermal waters, year-round agriculture, and natural beauty, Peshkopi is also developing a reputation as tourism destination for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, mountain biking, and rock climbing. The third tallest mountain in the Balkans, Mount Korabi, and the birthplace of Albania&#x27;s national hero, Gjerg Kastrioti, are nearby heritages sites. The district also contains large mineral ore deposits such as chromium, sulfur, and marble. It is also an important industrial center in Albania, producing many agricultural products for Albania.

==History==
The name of Peshkopi is derived from the word &quot;peshkop&quot; meaning &quot;bishop&quot; in Albanian and from &quot;Episkopè&quot; in Greek. Bulgarian maps of the eleventh century show the town under the name &quot;Presolengrad&quot;. The region of Dibër was subsumed under the Archbishopric of Ohrid in 1019, and one year later received the status of an episcopate with its center in the Bulke ward of Peshkopi, located in what is now the neighborhood of Dobrovë. The central church of the Dibër Episcopate was that of St. Stephen (). The seat of the Episcopate would later be relocated, but the town of Peshkopi retained its name. Peshkopi is referenced as early as the fifteenth century under the name &quot;Peskopia&quot;.

The region today known as Dibër was inhabited in pre-Christian times by the Illyrian tribe known to the Romans as &quot;Penestae&quot;, Πενέσται in Ancient Greek ().

By the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire had completed its conquest of Albania. Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Peshkopi (then &quot;Debre-i Zir&quot;, which meant &quot;Lower Debre&quot; in Persian) was a small market town, overshadowed by the larger and more flamboyant Debar (, &quot;Greater Dibër&quot;), which today lies just over the Macedonian border. The population of Peshkopi was almost completely Muslim by 1583. In 1873 an Ottoman barracks was built in Peshkopi, housing up to 8,000 soldiers.

The Dibër region, including Peshkopi, took part in the uprisings against Ottoman authority that were occurring throughout Albania in the early 1910s. Albanian armed bands () captured Peshkopi from the Ottomans on August 16, 1912.

In the aftermath of the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, a Serbian army occupied Dibër and entered Peshkopi in early December 1912. Albanian forces retook the city on September 20, 1913. Bulgarian army soldiers invaded Peshkopi on January 1, 1916. The Austro-Hungarian Empire, an ally of Bulgaria, brought an army to Peshkopi on April 12, 1916, and engaged in punitive house-burnings and executions throughout the region in an attempt to quell local resistance. The Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians departed the area in September 1918.

Italian forces invaded Albania in 1939, reaching Peshkopi on April 15. Albanian Communist partisans retook Peshkopi on September 9, 1943. The following October, the partisans defeated Balli Kombëtar forces in an armed battle for control of the city. In July 1944, German forces occupied the city, but were expelled later that same month. Fighting continued in the Dibër region until early September, leaving the Communist-dominated National Liberation Army () in control.

== Geography ==
Peshkopi is located in northeastern Albania, in the Dibër County. It is situated in the valley of the Drin river, at the foot of the Korab mountain range. The town is the administrative center of the district and has a population of around 14,000 people. The Korab mountain range, which is the highest range in the Balkans, is located to the east of the town. The Drin River, which is the longest river in the country, flows through the valley and provides water for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. The valley is also known for its fertile soil and is an important agricultural area, producing crops such as corn, wheat, and vegetables.

==Education==
Peshkopi has a number of primary and secondary schools, which provide education to children in the town and surrounding areas. The schools offer a range of subjects including math, science, language, and social studies. Many of them also have extracurricular activities such as sports, music, and art programs. Overall, education is highly valued in Peshkopi and the government is continuously investing in the development of the educational system in the town.

===Tertiary===
Peshkopi briefly had a branch of Aleksandër Moisiu University. It was closed in 2017 by order of the national Ministry of Education for alleged failure to meet standards.

==Tourism==

The main form of tourism in the region is mountain tourism, due to the hilly terrain and extensive forest. The district of Dibra is home to two of the thirteen national parks in Albania, Lurë National Park, and Korab-Koritnik Nature Park, which offer a variety of outdoor activities including climbing, walking, skiing, trekking, picnics, hunting, kayaking, etc.

The museum, located beside the general secondary school, houses a collection of local costumes, carpets, kitchen equipment and filigree jewelry, as well as a number of models of local architecture.

Elez Isufi Boulevard is a pedestrian-only street in the middle of Peshkopi lined with linden () trees. The street is paved with stone from non-native stone from Berat.

Thermal mineral water springs and sulphur baths () in the vicinity of Peshkopi are a draw for seasonal tourism, primarily from within Albania, but also to a lesser extent from neighboring countries. They are reputed to alleviate some health issues. The baths are located a short distance east of the city, upstream along the creek which runs through the middle of Peshkopi.

==Sports==

The main sport played in Peshkopi is football. The city&#x27;s main team is KF Korabi Peshkopi and its home stadium is Korabi Stadium with a capacity of 6,000 spectators. The multidisciplinary club&#x27;s home arena is the Bashkim Lala Sports Palace, which has a capacity of over 2,000 spectators. KF Korabi currently plays in the Albanian First Division. They were runners-up in the 1961, 2015–16 Albanian First Division going in to the Albanian Superliga.

==Transportation==
Peshkopi is an important transportation hub, located at the crossroads of several important roads connecting Albania with Kosovo and North Macedonia. The town is served by the Rinas Mother Teresa International Airport in the capital city of Tirana, which is located around 200 km to the west of Peshkopi. There are also regular bus services connecting the town with Tirana and Durres.

===Bus===
Peshkopi is served by bus lines to and from Tirana and Durrës. Buses typically depart in the morning on a fixed schedule. There are also minibuses and vans () serving a wider set of destinations, which depart when sufficiently full. Minibuses to Tirana and Durrës are generally somewhat more expensive than the equivalent bus route. 

===Highways===
The main road to Peshkopi is SH6 (State Road 6). A new highway called the Arbër Highway () is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in Spring 2023. The 200 km road will link Tirana with Debar, North Macedonia and will connect with SH6.

===Train===
There is no train service to Peshkopi.

<text>Wilhelm Lexis (17 July 1837, Eschweiler, Germany – 24 August 1914, Göttingen, Germany), full name Wilhelm Hector Richard Albrecht Lexis, was a German statistician, economist, and social scientist. The Oxford Dictionary of Statistics cites him as a &quot;pioneer of the analysis of demographic time series&quot;. Lexis is largely remembered for two items that bear his name—the Lexis ratio and the Lexis diagram.

== Life ==

Lexis graduated in 1859 from the University of Bonn, where he studied science and mathematics. He spent some time afterwards in various occupations and, in 1861, went to Paris to study social science. It was there that Lexis became acquainted with the work of Adolphe Quetelet, whose quantitative approach to the social sciences was to guide much of Lexis&#x27; work. He spent about ten years in Paris, after which he took a teaching position in Strasbourg (France). At some point during this period, Lexis wrote his first book (&quot;Introduction to the Theory of Population Statistics&quot;) and had it published in 1875, by which time he was teaching at the Imperial University of Dorpat (today the University of Tartu) in what is today Tartu, Estonia.

Starting in 1876, Lexis was the chair of the Economics Department at the University of Freiburg. The various papers written by him during his eight-year tenure at Freiburg were, in the eyes of statistics historian Stephen Stigler, &quot;his most important statistical work&quot;. Foremost among them was the 1879 paper &quot;On the Theory of the Stability of Statistical Series&quot;, which introduced the quantity now often called the Lexis ratio.

Lexis moved on from Freiburg to the University of Breslau but stayed there only a few years (from 1884 to 1887). He then settled in Göttingen, taking a position at that city&#x27;s University. In 1895, he established a course in actuarial science at the university, the first ever in Germany. In 1901, Lexis became a member of the Insurance Advisory Council for Germany&#x27;s Federal Insurance Supervisory Office. He remained a member of the Council until his death in 1914. During this final period of his life, Lexis published two more books: &quot;Treatises on Population and Social Statistics&quot; (Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1903) and &quot;General Economics&quot; (Leipzig: Teubner, 1910). He was also the editor of a book on the German education system.

== Work ==

Throughout his professional career, Lexis published books and articles on a wide variety of topics, including demography, economics and mathematical statistics. However, little of that work proved to have lasting significance. Today, Lexis is largely remembered for two items that bear his name—the Lexis ratio and the Lexis diagram. His theory of mortality has also enjoyed a recent revival of interest.

=== Lexis ratio ===
To Lexis, a time series was &quot;stable&quot; if the underlying probability giving rise to the observed rates remained constant from year to year (or, more generally, from one measurement period to the next). Using modern terminology, such a time series would be called a zero-order moving-average series (also known as a white noise process). Lexis was aware that many series were not stable. For non-stable series, he imagined that the underlying probabilities varied over time, being affected by what he called &quot;physical&quot; forces (as opposed to the random &quot;non-essential&quot; forces that would cause an observed rate to be different than the underlying probability). In his 1879 paper &quot;On the Theory of the Stability of Statistical Series&quot;, Lexis set himself the task of devising a method for distinguishing between stable and non-stable time series.

To this end, Lexis created a test statistic equal to the ratio between (i) the probable error of the observed rates and (ii) the probable error that would be expected if the underlying probabilities for each of the observed rates were all equal to the average rate observed across all of the observations. He called this ratio &quot;Q&quot;. Lexis then reasoned that if &quot;Q&quot; was sufficiently close to 1, then the time series was exhibiting what he called &quot;normal dispersion&quot; and one could assume that it was stable. If &quot;Q&quot; was substantially greater than 1, then the series was exhibiting &quot;supernomal dispersion&quot; and one must conclude that physical forces were having a discernible effect on the variability of the observations. Lexis used a &quot;Q&quot; value of 1.41 (i.e., the square root of 2) as the dividing line between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;supernormal&quot; dispersion.

&quot;Stability of Statistical Series&quot; is the only one of Lexis&#x27; works cited in his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of Statistics. It is also the only one that receives an extended discussion in Stigler&#x27;s &quot;A History of Statistics&quot;. And yet, Stigler ends his discussion by labeling the work a failure. To Stigler, its chief value was the discussion that it generated from other researchers in the field. It was those other researchers, and not Lexis, who created the modern science of time-series analysis.

=== Lexis diagram ===
Although it can take various forms, the typical Lexis diagram is a graphical illustration of the lifetime of either an individual or a cohort of same-aged individuals. On the diagram, each such lifetime appears as a straight line in a two-dimensional plane, with one dimension representing time and the other representing age. The use of Lexis diagrams is very common amongst demographers, so much so that they often are used without being identified as Lexis diagrams.

Lexis introduced his diagram in his first book, &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Population Statistics&quot; (Strasbourg: Trubner, 1875). However, the notion of using a time vs. age diagram appears to have been developed more or less simultaneously by other authors. See the paper by Vandeschrick (2001) for more detail.

=== Theory of mortality ===
In his 1877 book &quot;On the Theory of Mass Phenomena in Human Society&quot; (Freiburg: Wagnersche Buchhandlung), Lexis proposed that all human deaths could be classified into one of three types: (i) normal deaths, (ii) infant deaths and (iii) premature adult deaths. He also proposed that the normal deaths were subject to random forces such that, if all infant and other premature deaths were eliminated, the ages at which people died would exhibit a normal (i.e., Gaussian) distribution. Furthermore, the average of those ages would be equal to the age at which most adults are actually observed to die (i.e., the modal age at death), even though the actual observations are taking place in the presence of infant and other premature deaths.

In the adjacent diagram, the normal deaths are represented by the vertically-shaded bell-shaped area centered slightly above age 70; the infant deaths are represented by the unshaded area starting at age 0; the premature deaths are represented by the horizontally-shaded area bridging the infant and normal deaths.

Although Lexis&#x27; theory did generate some contemporaneous discussion, it never supplanted the traditional demographic measures of life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality rates. However, recent research suggests that the modal age at death might be a useful statistic for tracking changes in the lifespans of the elderly. For a survey of the contemporaneous response to Lexis&#x27; theory, see section IV (&quot;Reception of Lexis&#x27; hypothesis in the late 19th century&quot;) of Véron and Rohrbasser (2003). For a discussion of the modern-day use of the modal age at death, see Horiuchi et al. (2013).

<text>Richard Smith CBE FMedSci is a British medical doctor, editor, and businessman.

He is the director of the UnitedHealth Chronic Disease Initiative at Emory University (which grew out of the UnitedHealth “Ovations initiative”), which together with the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has created 11 centres in low and middle income countries that work on non-communicable disease. 

Smith also serves as chair of the Cochrane Library Oversight Committee and a member of the UK Panel on Research Integrity. Additionally, he is currently chairman of the board of directors of Patients Know Best.

Previously he was chief executive of UnitedHealth Europe, a subsidiary of the UnitedHealth Group that works with public health systems in Europe. Before that, from 1991 to 2004, he served as both editor-in-Chief of the &quot;BMJ&quot; (previously the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;), and chief executive of the BMJ Group. Smith worked for the &quot;BMJ&quot; for twenty-five years, from 1979 to 2004.

Smith is a proponent of open access publishing. He was editor of the &quot;BMJ&quot; when the journal first moved to online publishing, and made the journal&#x27;s archives freely available. He sits on the board of directors of the Public Library of Science, an open access publisher of scientific and medical research. He was editor in chief of the open-access &quot;Cases Journal&quot;, which aimed to create a database of medical case reports.

He is an honorary professor at Imperial College London and the University of Warwick and a member of the governing council of St George&#x27;s, University of London.

He is a founding Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, elected in 1998.

Having qualified in medicine in the University of Edinburgh, he worked in hospitals in Scotland and New Zealand before joining the BMJ. He also has a degree in management science from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Smith worked for six years as a television doctor with the BBC and TV-AM. He has published in dozens of medical journals, written widely in the lay press and currently blogs regularly for the BMJ. He has received three awards for journalism. 

Smith is the author of the book &quot;The Trouble with Medical Journals&quot; (2006, ), in which he contends that medical journals have become &quot;creatures of the drug industry&quot;, rife with fraudulent research and packed with articles ghost written by pharmaceutical companies. He has also written about the limitations and problems of the peer review process. In 2014, in an interview with &quot;New Scientist&quot;, he argued for criminalisation of research fraud.

His brother is comedian Arthur Smith.

==Views on cancer==
In December 2014, Smith wrote on the &quot;BMJ&quot; blog that trying to find a cure for cancer was a waste of money, claiming that, &quot;with love, morphine, and whisky&quot;, the disease is the best way to die.
His remarks provoked outrage. The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; said:
Smith’s New Year’s Eve blog on thebmj.com about cancer offering the best death garnered global media coverage and triggered a social media storm from thousands of bereaved relatives and the parents of children with cancer. He was accused of &quot;glibly glossing over the pain&quot; of cancer, to quote Michael Broderick, one of the 173 respondents on thebmj.com.

Smith responded and tried to clarify some of his points in a follow-up blog post on 5 January.

<text>Lješanska nahija () is a historical region in eastern Montenegro. It was a &quot;nahija&quot; (sub-district) of the Ottoman Empire. In the administration of the Principality of Montenegro, the nahija was part of Old Montenegro, alongside Katun, Rijeka and Crmnica. The Serbian Gradac Monastery was once located within the region.

Lješanska nahija included the area to the Riječka nahija, and was the most impoverished and smallest part of the Principality of Montenegro, consisting of several brotherhoods, which due to some differences among them (especially religious) could not in its entirety establish itself as other tribes.
It was also home to the Albanian tribe of the Goljemadi.

The region was bordered by Lješkopolje, an Ottoman frontier which was not part of Montenegro prior to the Congress of Berlin (1878).

==History==
The toponym derives from a Slavicized variant of the Albanian masculine name Lesh (&quot;Lješ&quot;). According to a local tradition, the ancestor arrived from the city of Lezhë, however the actual name is regarded as being much older since 
as early as 1496 Đurađ Crnojević mentions the nobleman &quot;Radovan Lъšević (Lješević)&quot; in the area of Lješanska nahija, while its inhabitants as &quot;Lьšane&quot; (Lješane).

The name (Lješanska nahija) is first mentioned in 1692. Traditionally, Vojvodas (The Dukes) came from the House of Uskoković.

<doc id="542020" wikidata="Q971943" url="?curid=542020" title="Sander Levin">
<text>Sander Martin Levin (born September 6, 1931) is an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2019, representing (numbered as the from 1983 to 1993 and as the from 1993 to 2013). Levin, a member of the Democratic Party from Michigan, is a former ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee; he was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee from 2010 to 2011. He was the older brother of former U.S. Senator Carl Levin, and is the father of former Congressman Andy Levin, his successor.

In December 2017, Levin announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and not seek re-election in 2018. His son Andy was elected on November 6, 2018, and took office in the 116th Congress, which commenced on January 3, 2019.

==Early life and education==
Levin was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Jewish parents Bess Rachel (née Levinson) and Saul R. Levin. He graduated from Central High School in Detroit, received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago in 1952, a Master&#x27;s degree in international relations from Columbia University in 1954, and a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1957. Afterwards, he developed a private practice in Detroit.

==State politics==
Levin was named chairman of the Oakland County Democratic Party in 1962. He was elected as State Senator for the 15th district in 1964, defeating Republican George W. Kuhn.
Levin served in the position until 1970. Following the 1967 resignation of Michigan Democratic Party chairman Zolton Ferency, Levin was elected state party chairman on December 17. He resigned his position as minority floor leader the following January. He served as Senate minority leader from January 1969 to January 1970, when he resigned to run for governor.

He made unsuccessful campaigns for Governor of Michigan in 1970 and 1974, both times losing to Republican William Milliken. He was a Fellow of the Harvard Kennedy School in 1975. From 1977 through 1981 he was assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1982, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman William Brodhead decided not to run for re-election, instead making an unsuccessful run for governor. Levin won the Democratic primary in Michigan&#x27;s 17th congressional district with 49% of the vote, which at that time included northwestern Detroit as well as parts of Macomb and Oakland counties. Levin subsequently won this 1982 general election with 67% of the vote. He typically won re-election with at least 56% of the vote since then, exceptions being 1992 and 1994 elections. After the 1990 United States Census, his district was renumbered as the 12th district and lost its share of Detroit. In 1992, he narrowly defeated businessman and Vietnam War veteran John Pappageorge 53%-46%. In a 1994 rematch, Levin again defeated this same opponent, during the midst of the Republican Revolution, 52%-47%. Then again in 1996, Levin defeated Pappageorge by a larger margin in a third rematch 57%-41%. In 1998, Levin won re-election against Republican nominee Leslie A. Touma, 56%-42%. In 2000, Detroit Metro area businessman Bart Baron gained the endorsement of the United Auto Workers Union, but Levin still managed to win re-election with 64% of the vote. The 2000s redistricting added heavily Democratic Southfield and Mount Clemens to the district, and he won re-election in every election with at least 61% of the vote since.

;2012

After redistricting, Levin&#x27;s district was merged with the 9th District of fellow Democrat Gary Peters. The district retained Peters&#x27; district number—the 9th—but geographically was more Levin&#x27;s district. Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn 14th District. This effectively handed the Democratic nomination to Levin. While he lost Southfield to the 14th, it picked up the rest of Royal Oak, as well as Oak Park, Clawson and Berkley, among other locations. It was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Levin breezed to a 16th term with 61.4 percent of the vote.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Ways and Means (former Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Trade (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Income Security

Levin took over as chairman of the Ways and Means committee on March 4, 2010, when Charles B. Rangel of New York stepped aside in due to a number of ethics violations. Levin served as chairman until January 2011 and ranking member until the end of 2016.

Levin was a member of the House Baltic Caucus and the Congressional Arts Caucus.

==Political positions==

===Foreign policy===
As a member of Congress, Levin was a supporter of Israel. He supported the nuclear deal with Iran, and said that Israel, the region, and the world would be more secure under the Iran nuclear deal.

==Personal life==
His wife of 50 years, Vicki Schlafer, died on September 4, 2008. They had four children: Andy, Jennifer, Madeleine, and Matthew and ten grandchildren.

In a private ceremony in July 2012, Levin married Pamela Cole, age 61, a Pennsylvania State University psychology professor who studies emotional development. They met through his late wife Vicki. Cole and Levin worked to create a fund in her name for young professionals researching early childhood development.

Levin comes from a family that has long been prominent in Michigan politics. His younger brother Carl Levin was the state&#x27;s senior Senator until his retirement in January 2015. His uncle, Theodore, was a federal judge. His first cousin Charles was a Michigan Supreme Court justice, after serving as a Michigan Court of Appeals judge. Another first cousin, Joseph Levin, was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. His son Andy Levin was an unsuccessful candidate for the Michigan Senate in 2006, but in 2018 was elected to succeed him in the United States House of Representatives.

<doc id="542023" wikidata="Q3430882" url="?curid=542023" title="Richard Horton (editor)">
<text>Richard Charles Horton (born 29 December 1961) is editor-in-chief of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, a United Kingdom–based medical journal. He is an honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University College London, and the University of Oslo.

After studying medicine at the University of Birmingham, he joined the liver unit at London&#x27;s Royal Free Hospital. In 1990, he became assistant editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot; and five years later became its editor-in-chief in the UK.

He has been a medical writer for &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In 2003, he published &quot;Second Opinion: Doctors, Diseases and Decisions in Modern Medicine&quot;, a book about controversies in modern medicine. In 2005 he wrote &quot;Doctors in society: medical professionalism in a changing world&quot;, an inquiry into the future of medical professionalism, for the Royal College of Physicians. He has served in various roles with the World Health Organization (WHO).

==Early life and education==
Richard Horton was born in London. His early education was at Bristol Grammar School.

In 1986 he completed his studies at the University of Birmingham, having gained a Bachelor of Science degree in physiology and a degree in medicine.

==Career==
After completing his early medical training at Birmingham, he joined the liver unit at London&#x27;s Royal Free Hospital. In 1990, he became assistant editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot; and in 1993 moved to New York as its North American editor. Two years later he returned to the UK to become its editor-in-chief.

Horton served as a medical columnist for &quot;The Observer&quot; and has written for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In 2003, he published his book about controversies in modern medicine, &quot;Second Opinion: Doctors, Diseases and Decisions in Modern Medicine&quot;. In 2005, as a member of a working party set up by the Royal College of Physicians, he was the chief author of their report into the future of medical professionalism, &quot;Doctors in Society&quot;.

Horton is an advocate for the WHO. He has co-chaired a WHO Scientific Advisory Group on Clinical trials registration, chaired the Board of the Health Metrics Network, sat on the External Reference Group for WHO&#x27;s Research Strategy, and was an external advisory board member for the WHO European Region. Horton was the first president of the World Association of Medical Editors, and was a past-president of the US Council of Science Editors (2005–06). In 2008, he was appointed to a research and analytical management panel as a Senior Associate of the Nuffield Trust. In 2011, he was elected to the US Institute of Medicine. From 2011 to 2015 he co-chaired the independent Expert Review Group on Information and Accountability for Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27; Health.

In 2016, he was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to an expert group advising the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, which was co-chaired by presidents François Hollande of France and Jacob Zuma of South Africa. In 2017, he served on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) High-Level Working Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children and Adolescents. In the same year he joined Physicians for Human Rights&#x27;s board.

=== Climate change and health professionals ===
A few days after the worldwide mobilisation promoted by the activist movement Extinction Rebellion, Horton asserted in a video that health professionals should involve themselves directly.

===Denial of retraction of discredited vaccine paper===

On 28 February 1998 Horton published a controversial paper by Andrew Wakefield and 12 co-authors with the title &quot;Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children&quot; suggesting that vaccines could cause autism. The publication of the paper set off a sharp decline in vaccinations in Europe and America and in subsequent years globally. In the United Kingdom, the Health Protection Agency attributed a large measles outbreak in 2008 and 2009 to a concurrent drop in the number of children receiving the MMR vaccine. Pockets of measles – which can be fatal —have also cropped up in Canada and the United States as a result of parents&#x27; decision not to vaccinate.

Horton was heavily criticised for refusing to take action for so long. He was finally forced to retract the paper in February 2010 after the General Medical Council (GMC), which oversees doctors in Britain, said that &quot;there was a biased selection of patients in &quot;The Lancet&quot; paper&quot; and that Wakefield&#x27;s &quot;conduct in this regard was dishonest and irresponsible&quot;. According to reporter Brian Deer, who exposed Wakefield&#x27;s paper as fraudulent, Horton opposed the GMC&#x27;s investigation that led to the retraction, arguing:
My own view is that the GMC is no place to continue this debate. But the process has started and it will be impossible to stop.
Horton defended his position by saying &quot;I do not regret publishing the original Wakefield paper. Progress in medicine depends on the free expression of new ideas. I worked at the Royal Free from 1988 to 1990 and met him on many occasions. He is a committed, engaging, and charismatic clinician and scientist. He asks big questions about diseases - what are their ultimate causes? - and his ambition often brings quick and impressive results.&quot; However, there are groups criticising Horton for contributing to the ongoing dramatic drop of vaccination of children in Europe and America that causes several epidemics and deaths by delaying the retraction of the paper for 12 years.

===Royal Society===
In the 11 May 2005 &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Horton criticized the British scientific group, the Royal Society, under Lord Rees for its neglect of medicine.

===Roy Meadow===
Horton published an article in 2005 supporting paediatrician Roy Meadow who had been charged with serious professional misconduct by the GMC for giving erroneous and seriously misleading evidence in the Sally Clark trial. This was especially controversial as the article appeared whilst the GMC proceedings were still under way and was published on the first day of Meadow&#x27;s defence. The article &quot;incensed&quot; Clark, a solicitor who had been the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice. With the support of erroneous statistical (and other) evidence from Meadow, the prosecution wrongly convicted her of murder and she spent over three years in prison before her successful second appeal.

Her husband wrote a rebuttal letter to &quot;The Lancet&quot; in order to correct Horton&#x27;s &#x27;many inaccuracies and one-sided opinions&#x27; and to prevent them from prejudicing independent observers. James Le Fanu, medical practitioner and writer, also wrote to &quot;The Lancet&quot; in the same issue and described Horton&#x27;s words as &#x27;mischief&#x27;. The Clark family issued a statement addressing and countering with established fact each of the points making up Horton&#x27;s biased support of Meadow.

===Iraq War===

At the &quot;Time to Go Demo&quot; of 23 September 2006, Horton accused American president George W. Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair of lies and killing children in Iraq. On 11 October, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published new estimates of the death toll of Iraqi citizens after the US-led invasion in 2003, putting it at a total of 655,000. Some supporters of the invasion of Iraq dismissed it for what they claimed was flawed methodology. Some opponents of the invasion questioned its reliability due to its extreme divergence from other data on the conflict. Some journals and statistical experts were supportive. Other experts in the field were not convinced, saying the estimates were &quot;high, and probably way too high&quot;, and that the authors had published a &quot;misinterpretation of their own figures&quot;. 
Others were incredulous that the survey could have been performed as reported under such dangerous conditions.

Iraq&#x27;s health minister estimated during a press conference in November 2006 that between 100,000 and 150,000 people had died since the invasion in 2003, based on an estimate of around 100 deaths per day brought to morgues and hospitals during 2006, while saying that the &quot;Lancet&quot; estimates were an &quot;exaggerated number&quot;.

===Open letter for the people of Gaza===
In August 2014 &quot;The Lancet&quot; published an open letter for the people of Gaza, criticising Israel in the wake of the 2014 Gaza conflict.

Horton responded to criticism of the letter by saying that it was &quot;a smear campaign&quot; and that he didn&#x27;t &quot;honestly see what all this has to do with the Gaza letter. I have no plans to retract the letter, and I would not retract the letter even if it was found to be substantiated&quot;. However, Horton subsequently came to Israel&#x27;s Rambam Hospital for a visit and said that he &quot;deeply, deeply regret[ted] the completely unnecessary polarization that publication of the letter by Paola Manduca caused&quot;.

Mark Pepys wrote: &quot;The failure of the Manduca et al authors to disclose their extraordinary conflicts of interest… are the most serious, unprofessional and unethical errors. The transparent effort to conceal this vicious and substantially mendacious partisan political diatribe as an innocent humanitarian appeal has no place in any serious publication, let alone a professional medical journal, and would disgrace even the lowest of the gutter press.&quot; In addition, Pepys accused Horton personally saying that &quot;Horton’s behavior in this case is consistent with his longstanding and wholly inappropriate use of &quot;The Lancet&quot; as a vehicle for his own extreme political views. It has greatly detracted from the former high standing of the journal.&quot; In response, Horton said: &quot;How can you separate politics and health? The two go hand-in-hand.&quot;

===Coronavirus pandemic===

Horton&#x27;s initial response to the outbreak of Coronavirus was cautious, telling his Twitter followers on 23 January 2020 that COVID-19 probably &quot;has moderate transmissibility and relatively low pathogenicity.&quot; But, as evidence came in from China, on 29 January, he said: &quot;It must now surely be time to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&quot; And, on 31 January, he tweeted about &quot;draconian measures that limit population mobility.&quot;

By 7 March, Horton was calling on the UK Government to &quot;act more decisively. They must abandon their fears of the negative short-term public and economic consequences that may follow from restricting public freedoms.&quot; And, on 10 March, he called for the &quot;urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies.&quot;

On 18 March, Horton strongly criticised the Government&#x27;s initial plans &quot;to allow a controlled epidemic&quot;, saying: &quot;Any numerate school student could make the calculation. With a mortality of 1% among 60% of a population of some 66 million people, the UK could expect almost 400,000 deaths.&quot;

Then on 26 March, he said: &quot;We knew in the last week of January that this was coming. The message from China was absolutely clear that a new virus with pandemic potential was hitting cities. ... We knew that eleven weeks ago and then we wasted February when we could have acted.&quot; And, on 28 March, Horton&#x27;s &quot;Lancet&quot; editorial stated that, having seen January&#x27;s reports from China, the authorities &quot;had a duty to immediately put the NHS and British public on high alert.&quot;

On 29 March, the NHS Coronavirus director, Keith Willett, responded to Horton saying that the NHS had &quot;declared a Level Four - the highest - National Emergency on 30 January&quot;. (This declaration, however, was not publicised until 3 March so it is unclear if Willett intended this as a response to Horton&#x27;s &quot;Lancet&quot; editorial.)

On 1 May, Horton was interviewed for the Chinese news program &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; and praised the &#x27;innovation&#x27; of the Chinese response (as compared to the past).

By 16 May, an editorial explained that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been weakened since the 1980s and needs rebuilding. It included a call for a U.S. president in 2021 who values public health over partisan politics.

==Honours and awards==
Horton is a Fellow of both the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Royal College of Physicians.

In 2007, he received the Edinburgh Medal for scientific and professional contributions to the understanding and well-being of humanity. Two years later he was awarded the Dean&#x27;s Medal from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In 2015, he received the Friendship Award from Government of China. He has worked closely with Chinese medical experts and healthcare officials since 2008.

In 2016, he received the Andrija Štampar medal from the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European region. The following year, for his work in public health, he was a recipient of the Edwin Chadwick Medal.

In 2019, he received the Roux Prize.

In 2021, he received the Physicians for Human Rights award.

Horton is an honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the University College London, and the University of Oslo. For his work in global health, he was an honoured with a doctorate at the University of Tromsø. He is a council member of the University of Birmingham.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to health and medical journalism.

==Personal and family==
In 1998, Horton married paediatrician Ingrid Johanna Wolfe. They separated in 2017. He has one daughter from this marriage. He is being treated for stage 4 melanoma.

He has been inspired by Raymond Hoffenberg and Amartya Sen.

<doc id="542024" wikidata="Q571822" url="?curid=542024" title="Thal, Styria">
<text>Thal () is a village in the Austrian state of Styria, about west from the edge of Graz, Austria&#x27;s second largest city. Its population in the 2014 census was 2,240.

Thal is most notably the birthplace of bodybuilder, actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger, who lived there until 1966 at the age of 19. In July 2011, Schwarzenegger opened his childhood house as the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum.

==Toponymy==
The etymology of the town, which simply means &quot;valley&quot; (now spelled &quot;Tal&quot; in Standard German; cognate to English seen in many placenames) before the German Orthographic Conference of 1901 reforms, is ultimately from a cadet branch of the Graben von Stein, named &quot;Von Thal&quot; (&quot;De Valle&quot; in Medieval Latin).

==History==
Until the 800s AD, the area was unsettled. The first forest village settlement was established in the 10th century. In the following two centuries, scattered hamlets grew up in the area. On 1 January 1850, the settlement became known as &quot;St. Jacob Thal&quot;. On 1 January 1895, the village became a settlement with market town (&quot;Marktgemeinde&quot;) status.

==Geography==
The village is located about west of the Styrian capital of Graz. Thal is a scattered settlement of houses, consisting of about 19 grouped hamlets: Eben, Eck, Hardt, Haslau, Kirchberg, Kötschberg, Linak, Oberbichl, Oberthal, Plabutsch, Schlüsselhof, Steinberg, Unterbichl, Unterthal, Waldsdorf, Waldsdorfberg, Wendlleiten, Windhof, and Winkel. The village contains a small lake called Thalersee.

==Notable landmarks==
===Parish church of St. Jacob===
In 1735, a wooden chapel was built in Baroque style. In 1772, the parish church of St. Jacob was built and originally dedicated to St. Sebastian. It was extended in 1992, with the foundation stone laid on 23 May 1992 and the church was consecrated on 15 May 1994 by Johann Weber. The extension to the existing church was by the architect Manfred Fuchs Bichler, and the Austrian painter, graphic artist and architect Ernst Fuchs. The artistic design of the entire complex with bright colors and shapes and impressive lighting effects received critical acclaim.

=== Oberthal House ===

By the 12th century, the lords of Waldsdorf had established their seat on the site of the present stately home in the shape of a fortified manor house with a large dairy farm. From 1315 to 1605, it was owned by the noble family of Windisch-Graetz. In 1563, major conversion and renovation work was carried out on the castle under the then-owner and designer, Erasmus of Windisch-Graetz, which saw it expanded into a Renaissance style stately home with a courtyard surrounded on three sides by three-storey high, columnar arcades. There is still an underground passage, dating to that period, that runs as far as Graz, but it is impassable after the first several hundred metres.

From 1605 to 1622, the house was owned by Bernard Walter of Walthersweil and, from 1622 to 1624, by the Schranz of Schranzenegg family, who sold it to Siegmund Friedrich, Count Trautmannsdorff. During the rule of Sigmund Frederick the Younger of Trautmannsdorff, Oberthal House was converted and expanded between 1656 and 1661 into one of the most splendid in the area around the state capital. Above the house, a large pleasure garden (&quot;Lustgarten&quot;) was established, based on French prototypes, surrounded by a wall and decorated with grottos and a small maison de plaisance. In 1798, Thal House and its estate was sold to Leopold Edler of Warnhauser and remained in the possession of his family until 1841. From 1841 onwards, the palace was owned by the &quot;Freiherren&quot; of Walterskirchen. In 1846, the house was remodelled into the Romanesque style of a Scottish castle.

In 1905, Oberthal was sold to a Slovenian consortium, who had to give up the property after a short time for financial reasons. The house subsequently changed hands several times in the ensuing period and steadily fell into a state of dilapidation until it ended up in the hands of Dr. Friedrich Schuster, who had the building repaired again, getting rid of the 1846 modifications and reinstating its original Baroque appearance. In 1940 the house and the estate went to the Essberger family from Hamburg, Germany, owners of the Essberger Shipping company. From 1945 to 1955, the British garrison headquarters was located here, and, from 1955 to 1957, part of the house was rented to the British ambassador. On 1 November 1958, the house was restored to John Theodor Essberger, who died in 1959, whereupon his daughter, Lieselotte von Rantzau inherited it. Frau Liselotte von Rantzau died in 1993, and since such time it has been owned by her sons, Dr. Eberhart and Heinrich von Rantzau.

=== Ruins of Thal Castle ===
Thal Castle was first mentioned in the records in 1259, having been built on a hillock between the present parish church and the lake of Thalersee, probably at the beginning of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by a thick defensive wall with embrasures and battlement walks (&quot;Wehrgänge&quot;). Within the wall was the &quot;Palas&quot; and other residential buildings like the castle church dedicated to St. James. In 1569, Unterthal Castle and the estates of Sebastian of Windisch-Graetz were sold to the Carinthian governor (&quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;), Georg von Khevenhüller. From 1621, when it was owned by the Eggenberger family, the castle fell into ruins. In 1715, a fire destroyed large parts of the fortress. By around 1750 the castle church had also fallen into ruins. In 1772, the statue of the church patron was ceremoniously transferred to the present parish church and the old church demolished. In the subsequent period, only the round tower was occupied until 1979. In 1996, parts of the castle were restored and made habitable again.

=== Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum ===

Opened in 2011, the museum is located in the former forester&#x27;s lodge of the Herberstein dynasty. Numerous exhibits show his remarkable career, including his most important stages of life like his childhood and adolescence, becoming the world&#x27;s best bodybuilder, a worldwide star, and the Governor of California.
