==History==

===Pre-Colonial===
According to recent studies in archaeology, history and anthropology, The Andean region seems to have been inhabited since very remote times (perhaps several thousand years) by unknown groups that have left very few traces.

Then, around our era, another ethnic group of great cultural importance arrives in the region, perhaps of Chibcha origin, since they share with these their mythology, funeral and settlement patterns, housing construction, agricultural techniques, etc. When the Spanish arrive in the Andean Cordillera it will be with this second group you will come in contact with. It is assumed that the majority of today&#x27;s farmers are descendants of this Chibcha trunk group.

Another later and significant influence for the Andean pre-Hispanic culture are the Arawak groups, belonging to the most important ethnic groups of South America and the Caribbean, which migrated to the Venezuelan Andes during the 9th century AD. Finally, shortly before the arrival of the Spanish, we have a late penetration of Caribbean groups into the Andean region.

From the data of the chroniclers and the archaeological testimonies, today we know that the indigenous agricultural techniques like the irrigation systems (called acequias by the Spaniards) and the cultivation in terraces or andenes (used in all the South American Andes to take advantage of the slopes of the mountains) show for the time of the contact the existence of an economic infrastructure that supposes the presence of a numerous native population in the Andean Mountain range, as well as the existence of a hierarchical political organization and a network of communications in all the zone.
The Spaniards will use this indigenous population base for the development of the society they intended to establish in America. An important area of encomiendas and doctrinal towns. Thanks to this, the current toponymy of the Venezuelan Andes has preserved the names of the many indigenous groups that inhabited this region: Timoto-Cuica, Chama, Mocotíes, Mucuchíes, Tabayes, Mucutuy, Aricagua, etc.

===Spanish colonization===
In 1558 Juan Rodríguez Suárez founded the city of Mérida, in the name of the Corregimiento de Tunja, in honor of his native city of Mérida in Spain. In December 1607 Merida was separated from the Corregimiento de Tunja and united with the government of La Grita forming the corregimiento de Merida y La Grita. On November 3, 1622 it became the governorship of Merida with Juan Pacheco Maldonado as governor.

In 1676 Maracaibo (separated from the province of Venezuela) and Mérida-La Grita are united in a governorship called Province of Mérida del Espíritu Santo de Maracaibo (capital in Mérida) under the Audiencia of Bogota and then known as &quot;province of Maracaibo&quot; since 1678 that city becomes the capital of the governorship.

By 1677 the Pirate Michel de Grandmont sacked Trujillo, this attack led Governor Jorge de Madureira to change the capital of the province to the city of Maracaibo in 1678, to organize a more effective defense of the territory.

The territory of the province of Merida depended on the Viceroyalty of New Granada until 1777, when the Captaincy General of Venezuela was created.

===18th century===

In 1811 the province of Merida decided to rebel against Spain and join the process of Venezuelan Independence, along with seven other provinces to form the First Republic of Venezuela. The region would be represented by a star on the Venezuelan flag ever since.

In 1812 an earthquake devastates the city of Merida, and soon after the province is reconquered by the royalists.
The following year during the Admirable Campaign, Simón Bolívar liberates Mérida from the Realists, entering through La Grita (then the province of Mérida) in May 1813. On his journey he passes through Bailadores, Merida and Timotes liberating the province of Merida. With the victory of the Admirable Campaign, Merida is incorporated to the Second Republic of Venezuela.
In 1814 With the loss of the Second Republic, Merida is again temporarily incorporated into the Captaincy General of Venezuela. Three years later, the popular independence movement known as La Patriecita, will be suffocated by the Spanish royalists in 1818.

By 1820 the crossing of the Andes by Bolivar&#x27;s army, frees Merida again. With the victory of Boyacá on August 7, only the provinces of Maracaibo and Coro remained realistic and Merida was incorporated into the Third Republic of Venezuela.

In 1821 Merida was incorporated into Gran Colombia as part of the Department of Zulia, but in 1830 when Venezuela separated from Gran Colombia, the Department of Zulia was renamed the Province of Maracaibo. The provinces of Merida and Coro were immediately separated, leaving the province composed only of the sections Zulia and Trujillo.

In 1835 the division of the province was established in: Canton Mérida, Canton Mucuchíes, Canton Ejido, Canton Bailadores, Canton La Grita, Canton San Cristóbal and Canton San Antonio del Táchira and in 1842 the governor of the province Gabriel Picón inaugurates the first monument to Bolívar in the world known as La Columna in Milla Park.

Around 1856 the cantons of La Grita, San Crsitóbal and San Antonio del Táchira separate to form the Province of Táchira.

On November 23, 1863, the State of Merida was created with the territory of Merida, Ejido, Bailadores, Mucuchies and Timotes. In 1868 it was incorporated to the State of Zulia, together with Táchira, but it was separated in 1869.

In 1874 it was renamed Guzmán State. In 1881, it became part of the Great State of the Andes together with Táchira and Trujillo. This state was dissolved in 1899 and was limited to the territory it had as an independent state.

===20th century===
Since 1909 it has been a state of Merida. At the beginning of the century in 1912, after the closure of the Universidad Central de Venezuela by the government of Juan Vicente Gómez, the city of Mérida was left as the only one in the country with access to higher education, a situation that would last until 1922 when the UCV was reopened.

==Geography==
The state of Merida is located in the west of Venezuela, in the so-called Andean region, forming part of the Andes mountain range of the South American continent; of the three states (Merida, Tachira and Trujillo) that are located in this region. The territory of the state is located in the highest part of Venezuela, therefore, makes Merida the highest state of Venezuela, with altitudes above 4,000 m.a.s.l., reaching its highest point in Pico Bolivar at about 4,970 m.a.s.l.

Mérida is one of the states with the greatest geographical diversity, presenting different landscapes throughout its territory, with high areas above 4,000 m.a.s.l., medium areas with elevations around 900 and 1,600 m.a.s.l. and areas closer to sea level such as the so-called Southern Zone of the Lake below 200 m.a.s.l.

=== Climate ===

The climate is temperate but in the relatively small area of Mérida state, there are usually several dramatic climatic changes that occur daily. The climate in Mérida city has an average high temperatures between 24 °C and 25 °C, and low temperatures between 14 °C and 16 °C. At higher peaks on the Sierra Nevada de Mérida, temperatures tend to be under 0 °C. El Vigía sees temperatures around 28 °C. It rains almost every late afternoon in January–February.

The state tree is the &quot;Bucare&quot; and the state flower is the &quot;Frailejón&quot;, The &quot;Coloradito&quot; contains the tree that is found at the highest altitude in the world. In this mountains habitat the &quot;Oso Frontino&quot; bear and the Condor flies through the skies of the páramos and in the lagoons there are many trout.

==Culture==
===Gastronomy===
The typical dishes of the meridian food are:

*Acema andina (round bread made with corn flour)
*Pisca andina (coriander-based broth in which eggs, potatoes and milk are added)
*Cakes (filled with meat,chicken,cheese,etc..)
*Andean arepas (made with wheat flour)
*Trout (state-owned freshwater fish)
*Andean Hallaca
Among the most outstanding typical desserts are: the sweet polished (based on milk and covered with sugar), alfajores, guava sandwiches, milky candy and strawberries with cream, as well as drinks such as the Andean chicha, the calentaíto, mead, pineapple guarapo, blackberry wine and panela (paper).

It is worth mentioning that the southern gastronomy is internationally recognized, so many cooking contests and international fairs are held around the southern state.

===Music===
In the Páramo and the southern villages next to the Mocotíes area, the tradition and folklore of the mountains is expressed with native instruments; the so-called Peasant Music made up of genres such as waltz and string meringue are typical of the region.
One more expression of the popular music of this land, originates in the Northern Towns or Pan-American Zone, whose afro-descendant roots give life to the Black music or percussion, a range of genres such as La Murga, the Chimbangle, the Drums, among others... each one inspired by legends, paraphrases or simply improvisation.

Llanera music such as the Pasaje and Joropo that tell popular stories and the long days of work are not absent in Merida since due to the characteristics of the Panamerican Zone the popular genre of Venezuela is also felt; but not only in this zone since in the fields of the Mocotíes the Llanero feeling resonates with strength.

The sounds of the aboriginal cultures move like the wind around the whole state, being its epicenter the towns of San Juan, Chiguará and Lagunillas where the ethnic roots of the Meridians still prevail as if time never passed.

The most danceable genres typical of Caribbean cultures such as Salsa, Merengue, Colombian Cumbia, percussions and wind sounds are rooted in lands like Tovar, El Vigía, Ejido, Timotes, Zea and Merida; there the best orchestras of the Region and Venezuela have been formed and grown.

Although the Latin American, Afro-descendant, Caribbean and Timotocuica traditions and roots have not been erased with time, the influence of the Anglo-Saxon music has also had a place in these lands, this is obvious, it was impossible to think that cities like El Vigia and Ejido with an important commercial impact and cities like Merida and Tovar with a transcendental bohemian culture were not influenced by the Rock, Pop, Hip Hop, Dancehall, R&amp;B genres, among others.

===Bullfighting===
The Venezuelan Andes are lands of native roots and acquired as the Fiesta Brava, this type of party known as the most gallant and heroic of the existing ones felt by a sector of the world population but known as the most cruel and inhumane by another sector more dissident and humanist.
Bullfighting is a cultural expression of the mother country Spain, has had a strong follow up in the cities of the heights as those belonging to the States Merida and Tachira. The Andean epicenter (Merida) is a state where bullfights are held almost by law accompanied by the festivities of each town, which is why it is called the main course of the celebrations, this has led to important national and international events which not only allow the recreation and entertainment of the people also allows a cultural exchange of own and others causing the representatives of the municipal and state executives invest a large amount of foreign exchange in both promotion and implementation of them.

The festival of the bull and the bullfighter has generated strong changes in the southern Indo-Caribbean since the festivities create in the citizens an emotion of anxiety and waiting for them to take place.

Although Merida is not the cradle of bullfighting in Venezuela if it is the land where this art is best cooked, there are some of the best squares and some of the best schools giving rise to excellent shows and great bullfighters.

<text>Miranda State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela and the second most populous after Zulia State. As of the 2011 census, it had a population of 2,675,165 residents. It also has the greatest Human Development Index in Venezuela, according to the Venezuelan National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Caracas). The most recent population estimate was 3,194,390 in mid-2016.

Miranda is an important center for political, economic, cultural and commercial activities. The state is administered by a governor, and is sub-divided into 21 municipalities, each under a mayor.

Miranda State covers a total surface area of .

==History==
===Pre-Columbian history===
When the Spanish arrived, the region was inhabited by various Caribbean tribes. Among them were the Caracas, the Teques, the Cumanagotos, the Mariches and the Quiriquires. The Teques inhabited the southwestern part of Guaire. The Mariches inhabited the eastern part of the Caracas Valley. They practiced hunting and gathering, while others lived by fishing. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, these tribes were brave enough to fight for their territory, commanded by caciques like Guaicaipuro and Yare.

===Spanish Colonization===
Guaicaipuro was a legendary cacique of the Teques and Caracas Indians who resisted the conquistador Diego de Losada, while cacique Yare was the cumanagoto, quiriquire, charagoto and arauco chief who killed Captain Mendoza, who had murdered the Indian Tamanaco. Once all the tribes were subdued, the Spaniards settled completely on these lands, founding the city of Caracas, and later different towns in the interior of the state of Miranda.

During the colony this region became part of the Province of Caracas. At the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th century the highlands were used to cultivate, among other products, wheat destined largely for export to Cartagena de Indias and the Caribbean islands. From the second decade of the 17th century, cocoa displaced these crops. In addition, all commercial activities were monopolized by the Royal Guipuzcoa Company, which generated the first discontents and uprisings against the crown. From the beginning of the 17th century, slave labour quickly replaced the Indian labour force, concentrating on the Windward region, which was the largest cocoa producer. It was in this region that the first free blacks rose up against their masters, but were later stifled by Spanish troops.

===19th Century===
After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Venezuela still used the provinces as a political-territorial organization, which had been used for a long time. Miranda, at that time, was part of a province. Between 1832 and 1855 the use of the province persisted due to the confusion generated by the existence of a state as a political division of the country.

The division by states did not appear in Venezuela in a concrete way until 1864, when about twenty states were founded which, in the following governments, would be reduced to nine, among these, the founded state of Guzmán Blanco, which by 1873 only covered the region of Aragua.

In 1881, the State of Guzmán Blanco expanded its territory to include the region of Miranda, among other nearby regions that were included as part of Guárico.

In 1889, the territory of the Guzmán Blanco State was again modified by the Constitution, and its size was reduced by excluding several regions of the country such as the region of Aragua, but renaming the State as Edo Miranda.

==Geography==
===Location===
The state of Miranda is located in the north-central part of Venezuela. It is part of the so-called Capital Region together with the Capital District and the state of Vargas. It is located in the central coastal area of the country.

It borders on the north with the Federal District, on the south with the states of Guarico and Aragua, on the east with the Caribbean Sea and on the west with Aragua.
Relief
The relief is predominantly rugged and abrupt, with high slopes and narrow valleys within the mountains. The eastern sector constitutes a depression in the Serranía del Litoral. The Guaire River, which runs through the city of Caracas, divides the sector into two strips that are differentiated by their decline: the Valles del Tuy and La Depresión de Barlovento.

The waters that make up the hydrographic network of the state are mostly short course. The main river basin in the State is that of the River Tuy. The availability of water resources in the state is really precarious, as the state is located in the largest urban conglomerate in the country. The volume of available water is committed to supply almost the entire metropolitan district of Caracas, as well as the entire territory of Mirandina, which is poorly supplied by the reservoirs of La Mariposa, Lagartijo, La Pereza, Ocumarito, Agua Fría, Taguaza, El Guapo and Quebrada Seca. Many of the towns in the state are not frequently supplied with drinking water due to the high consumption of water resources. The Guaire, Tuy and Grande rivers are not used because they are in a state of contamination.

===Hydrography===
The hydrography of Miranda State is characterized by the short course and low flow of its rivers, with the exception of Tuy. This characteristic, combined with the settlement of the largest mass of population in the country, gives its rivers great significance as sources of water for urban consumption. The Tuy River, with a length of 250 km, rises at an altitude of 2 100 m, on the southern flank of the Litoral mountain range, flows eastwards through the Abra de Tácata to the Tuy and Barlovento valleys, and flows into the Caribbean Sea through the Paparo mouth. The El Jarillo River and the Aguas Frías and La Negra streams, tributaries of the Tuy on the left bank, have been dammed, near the Teques, in the Agua Fría reservoir, while the Ocumare, was dammed near Ocumare del Tuy, in the Ocumarito reservoir. The best known tributary is the Guaire River. On the right bank, the Tuy receives the Taguaza, Taguacita and Cuira rivers. Other important rivers are the Guarenas, Rio Grande or Caucagua, Capaya, El Guapo, Pacairigua, El Curiepe and Cúpira.
===Climate===
The climate of Miranda State is very hot in the low areas with temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 42 °C with very high humidity in the coastal region of Barlovento. In the Altos Mirandinos region, temperatures vary slightly throughout the year. In the dry season (December–March), temperatures vary between 10 °C and 23 °C, in the beginning of the wet season (April, May) high temperatures can be registered up to 33 °C, the rest of the year it varies between 16 °C and 25 °C.

===Soil===
The state of Miranda has soils with a high agricultural vocation that have been used since colonial times for the cultivation of cocoa, fruits, vegetables, cereals and other subsistence crops. However, the pressure of urban and industrial activities, especially the settlement of high population concentrations, has meant a loss of very considerable agricultural areas in the Tuy Valleys, in the Guarenas and Guatire area, and in the Barlovento region.

===Fauna===
In mountainous areas, rivers and streams, it is common to see mammals such as the raccoon (&quot;Didelphis marsupialis&quot;) and the spiny rat (&quot;Proechimys&quot; sp.), the squirrel (&quot;Sciurus granatensis&quot;), the mountain buckthorn (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;), the porcupine (&quot;Coendou prehensilis&quot;), the agouti (&quot;Dasyprocta leporina&quot;), the sloth (&quot;Bradypus tridactylus&quot;) very common in all areas of the municipality, the rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus brasiliensis&quot;), and the one that has almost disappeared from the municipal area, the matacan deer (&quot;Mazama americana&quot;) that was common in the area of Turgua. In addition, at night it is common to observe bats, among which the list bat (&quot;Saccopteryx bilineata&quot;), common fruit bat (&quot;Artibeus jamaicensis&quot;), common vampire bat (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;), and house bat (&quot;Molossus molossus&quot;) stand out. In the area of Los Carraos and Zuloaga caves, the insectivorous bat species &quot;Natalus tumidirostris&quot;, &quot;Myotis keaysi&quot; and &quot;Tadarida aurispinosa&quot; have been identified.

===Flora===
Among the common trees to find in the forest are, the ladle or child (&quot;Gyranthera caribensis&quot;), the bitter cedar (&quot;Cedrela mexicana&quot;), milky of the genus &quot;Sapium&quot; (&quot;Sapium stylare&quot;), yagrumo (&quot;Cecropia peltata&quot;), yagrumo male (&quot;Didymopanax morototoni&quot;), bucare (&quot;Erythrina poeppigiana&quot;), ceiba (&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;), indio desnudo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;); in some parts of the state the native flora has been intervened and replaced by fruit trees such as guamo (&quot;Inga fastuosa&quot;), mango (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;), orange (&quot;Citrus × sinensis&quot;), mandarin (&quot;Citrus × tangerina&quot;), guava (&quot;Psidium guajava&quot;), pomarosa (&quot;Syzygium jambos&quot;), avocado (&quot;Persea americana&quot;) and cambur (&quot;Musa × paradisiaca&quot;).

In the urban area it is common to see different types of ornamental trees, among which we can highlight the eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;), apamates (&quot;Tabebuia rosea&quot;), araguaneyes (&quot;Tabebuia chrysantha&quot;), mahoganies (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;), soaps (&quot;Hura crepitans&quot;), kujis (&quot;Acacia farnesiana&quot;), samans (&quot;Pithecellobium saman&quot;), bamboos (&quot;Bambusa vulgaris&quot;), riqui riquis (&quot;Heliconia latispatha&quot;) and tapir nails (&quot;Philodendron&quot;)

==Economy ==

The economic development of the state is based on the excellence of its soils, which has allowed the boom in agriculture. The region of the valleys of Tuy is characterized by the production of cocoa, sugar cane, and corn, among other crops. Barlovento also has great fertility of its lands, standing out the cultivation of cocoa and a great variety of fruits and vegetables. Likewise, Guatire and Guarenas have good lands for cultivation, being coffee one of the main products of the area.

Among other economic activities is the industrial one, standing out the manufacturing one, which conforms together with the one of the Federal District the first urban manufacturing set of the country.

The tertiary sector is extremely important: financial, commercial and service activities are concentrated in the area of Miranda. During the last two decades the tourist activity has grown with the installation of a great hotel infrastructure in the coast of Barlovento.

Cereals are grown in the fertile valleys of Tuy, while the microclimates are used for horticultural and fruit activities whose products are processed in the agro-industries.

In suburban areas, poultry and pig farming are practiced, especially promoted by Portuguese, Spanish and Italian immigrants.

Coffee production has decreased; however, the expansion of sugar cane and cotton crops in the Tuy Valley continues. Since colonial times there have been cocoa plantations in Barlovento combined with cassava, yams, caraotas or beans and bananas.

The industrialization process had an important economic impact, favored by its proximity to the city of Caracas, mainly in the cities of Petare, Guarenas and Guatire and in the valley of Tuy, where manufacturing centers of the metal-mechanical, chemical and food sectors were established. This led to a major urban boom, which caused a decrease in the amount of agricultural land.

===Palmeros de Chacao===
The tradition of the Palmeros de Chacao dates back to the Venezuelan colonial period in 1770, when the parish priest José Antonio Mohedano decided, in the form of a promise, to ask God for mercy due to an epidemic of yellow fever that existed in Caracas at the time. Coming from the haciendas near El Avila National Park, Mohedano sent a group of workers to bring down leaves from the Royal Palm to commemorate Jesus&#x27; entry into Jerusalem.

Nowadays, the Palmeros go up every Friday of the Council (the Friday before Palm Sunday) and come down the following Saturday with the palm leaves that will be blessed during the Sunday celebration. The palms are collected from a sector called Cueva de los Palmeros by the entrance of Sabas Nieves. Once blessed, the palms are distributed among the believers, who braid, crush and transform them into crosses that they keep in their homes as a sign of faith.

<text>Monagas State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela.

Monagas State covers a total surface area of and, as of the 2011 census, had a population of 905,443.

Monagas State is surrounded by Sucre State in the north, Anzoátegui State in the west and south, Bolívar State in the south, Delta Amacuro State in the south and east and the Paria Gulf in the northeast.

The state is named after the general and president of Venezuela José Tadeo Monagas, native from this state, and his brother and fellow president José Gregorio Monagas, native from the neighbor Anzoátegui State.

The capital of the state is Maturín.

== History ==

===Pre-colonial period===
Monagas dates back to the settlement of the territory by indigenous people of different ethnic groups hundreds of years ago, among which are the Warao and Kalina people, who mainly settled in the Orinoco Delta, and the people in the north of the state. The first aboriginal people to found a presence in the northern part of the region were the Chaima people belonging to the Capaya tribe.

Although settlement of the territory was slow, archaeological excavations and observations by the chroniclers of the Indies point to the existence of a well-developed village in Barrancas in 1530, when the conquistador Diego de Ordaz passed through the area in search of El Dorado. Also in the 16th century, missionaries arrived in the highlands and slowly the Christianisation and re-education of the Indians spread to the south; they thus adapted to a more sedentary life.

In the site where Barrancas is located today, archaeological objects and utensils have been found that belonged to the so-called Barrancoid and Saladoid cultures, the oldest of which have been dated to 1000 years before the Christian era. The archaeological evidence that has been found (and that is still being found) has made it possible to establish that Barrancas has been uninterruptedly inhabited at least since the 11th century, which makes it the oldest town in Venezuela and one of the oldest in the American continent.

===Spanish colonization===

Diego de Ordaz, a Spanish explorer obsessed with finding the legendary site of El Dorado, arrived in the village in August 1531 after traveling up the Orinoco River via the Caño Manamo. Impressed by its number of inhabitants – which he estimated at &quot;more than 400 &quot; (&#x27;huts&#x27;) – he decided to go down and meet personally with the cacique Naricagua, lord of his territories, whose name of the river Uyapari was associated with the village. The chronicler Juan de Castellanos, in his &quot;Elegías de varones ilustres de Indias&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Elegies of Illustrious Men of the Indies&quot;&#x27;), describes it as &quot;a powerful town of great people that on the ravines was placed the Cacique of Uyapari lordship&quot;.

The Capuchin missionary Friar Gerónimo de Muro, with the help of the Carib (Kalina), Cuaca and Chaima people, founded the town of , also known as San Antonio de Capayacuar, on 7 August 1713.

On 20 April 1731, the Aragonese friar Antonio de Blesa founded Santo Domingo de Guzmán de Caycuar; the area was inhabited by Chaima people and outcasts when the Capuchin missionaries arrived. The settlement would later be called Caicara de Maturín.

A Catholic mission of Chaima Indians with the Capuchin missionary Pedro de Gelsa founded the San Miguel Arcangel de Caripe settlement on 12 October 1734, which would later become Caripe.

Maturín was founded on 7 December 1760 by the Capuchin friar Lucas de Zaragoza.

The territory where Aguasay is now located was founded in 1769 by Friar Manuel de La Mata.

Uracoa was founded in 1784 by Friar José de Manzanera. In 1799 the German geographer Alexander von Humboldt and the Frenchman Aimé Bonpland visited Caripe as part of their trip through Venezuela. Other explorers who toured the area were the Italian Agostino Codazzi (1835) and the German Ferdinand Bellermann (1843).
===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1856, the Province of Maturín was created, separated from that of Cumaná. By 1864 the State of Maturín was ratified. But in 1879, Monagas was annexed to the and, from 1891 to 1898, it belonged to the .

In 1904, Maturín became the capital of the Monagas district of Bermúdez State, whose capital was Cumaná. For a long time, Monagas was an extremely poor state. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the people of the plains and swamps north of the Orinoco, under the rule of the Caribs, made alliances with the French and Dutch as a policy of tenacious resistance against Spanish domination. On ancient maps these lands are called Caribana, kingdom of the Caribs.

In 1909 the State of Monagas was created with its current boundaries in honor of General José Tadeo Monagas. In 1924 the Standard Oil Company started oil exploration activities in the area of Caripito, which experienced a slight repopulation. With the drilling of the Moneb No. 1 well in the Quiriquire field in 1928, oil exploitation began and the area experienced an important boost in urban development due to the arrival of migrant labor, particularly from the Caribbean Islands.

In 1929 the Standard Oil Company began to build the storage yard and the deep water dock on the San Juan River and on 15 October 1930, the tanker &quot;Creole Bueno&quot; left the port of Caripito with 20,000 barrels of oil bound for Trinidad.

In 1935, the Caripito marine terminal was inaugurated, located on the San Juan River, where Pan American Airways S-42 seaplanes arrived, which included it in their Central American and Caribbean route.

In 1936 Caripito International Airport was selected by aviator Amelia Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan as the second stopover of their trip around the world, staying overnight at the Standard Oil Company facilities. The event was widely publicized in the international press and the company provided logistical support to continue the flight through South America.

On 15 November 1940, the city of Punta de Mata was founded. On 28 December the same year, the first oil well was drilled in that area. In addition the Legislative Assembly of Monagas considered the convenience of creating the Bolivar District and integrated the municipalities of Punceres and Colon into its territory, designating Caripito as the capital, according to the decree of 19 January 1940, signed by Governor Jose Maria Isava on 30 January of the same year.

Under the direction of the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana, several hectares of Caribbean pine were planted between Barrancas and the nearby town of Uverito, an activity that significantly boosted the development of the area. By the 1970s, it was the most important settlement and port in the state of Monagas, mainly due to the lack of land road connections to the main nearby cities, such as Tucupita (Delta Amacuro) and Puerto Ordaz (State of Bolivar), although today it continues to be an important center for the transport of goods and passengers to these cities.

In 1976, the assets of Creole were nationalized and were managed by Lagoven, later by Corpoven and now by PDVSA in association with Repsol. By closing the refinery in 1976 and the oil terminal in 2002, an attempt was made to boost agricultural activity to take advantage of the fertile areas by growing cocoa, pepper, &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; ( and ) and yucca.

The newspaper &quot;El Oriental&quot; was founded in 1982 in the city of Maturín. On 20 August 1983, the State Legislative Assembly declared the creation of the Municipal Council of Libertador Municipality, in accordance with the provisions of the Law of Political Territorial Division of the State of Monagas, allowing the creation of Libertador Municipality. Since 1989, with the administrative reforms that were approved for the whole country, the state of Monagas elected for the first time, directly and secretly, its own governor and legislative assembly (called the legislative council since 2000).

In 2021, Cosme Arzolay was temporarily appointed governor. In November the same year, Ernesto Luna was proclaimed governor.

== Geography ==

===Relief===

The state has many plateaus and savannas located in the southwest. In the northeast and the southeast there are deltaic savannas in which rivers such as the San Juan, Guanipa, Caño Mánamo, and Tigre flow into. In the northwest is a group of mountains belonging to the eastern mountain range. This mountain range is divided into two massifs: the massif of el Turimiquire (in which the town of San Antonio is located) and the massif of Caripe (in which the town of Caripe is located). Cerro Negro (2000 m.) is the highest mountain of Monagas State. The mountain landscape features geological material from the Cretaceous, constituted exclusively by sedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone, shale and limestone, with the main geological formations being El Cantil, Barranquín, Guayuta and Querecual; it has elevations between above sea level, with valleys and depressions.

===Climate===

The weather is hot in the area of the Llanos, while it is cold in the mountains located in the north of the state. The average temperature in the low areas is between . In the area of the town of Caripe the cold temperature permits the cultivation of certain kind of typical plants from cold climates such as roses and strawberries. The level of rainfall in the state is between during the year.

The region is dominated by a rainy tropical climate with some local variations that respond to various factors such as altitude, wind and proximity to the sea. Most of the state, in the southern strip, has a climate typical of savannas with dry seasons that can last up to six months, which produces a severe water shortage. The average annual temperature of Monagas is approximately . In Maturín, Temblador and Uverito, average temperatures are between .

===Hydrology===

The rivers of the state belong to one of the two basins that are located in the state, the Atlantic Ocean basin and the Orinoco River basin. Rivers such as the Guanipa, Tigre, Morichal Largo, Caño Mánamo, Amana, Tonoro, Tabasca, and Uracoa flow into the Orinoco River. On the other hand, the Guarapiche, San Juan, Río de Oro, and Caripe rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The rivers of the Atlantic Ocean basin come from the mountains located in the northwest of the state and the rivers of the Orinoco River basin come from the many plateaus located in the southwest of Monagas State and from Anzoategui State.

It has an extensive hydrographic network with a fairly uniform geographical distribution, with the Guarapiche River standing out in the area of the tables. The rivers are numerous and of little depth, marking the end of the piedmont in which three river basins with a north–south course are located: those of the rivers Amana-Areo, Guarapiche, and Púnceres-Aragua. From west to east the Tácata, Tonoro, Caris, Guanipa and Tigre rivers cross the state. Monagas State has a great number of moderate rivers and streams; among the main ones are:

*Guarapiche River
*Mapirito River
*Tigre River
*Morichal Largo River
*San Juan River
===Vegetation===

The area&#x27;s vegetation is intertropical and is adapted to the different altitudes, climates, and kinds of soil in the state. The State of Monagas has an extensive biodiversity compared to other Venezuelan states. More than 2000 species of vascular flora have been catalogued within the Monagas territory. The most symbolic tree in the state is the moriche (&quot;Mauritia flexuosa&quot;) along the Morichal Largo River. The dominant vegetation type in the north of Monagas State is rainforest, such as that found in the mountainous area of the San Juan River valley and the municipalities of Acosta and Caripe. In these cold areas, it is possible to grow temperate plants such as strawberries and roses. However, in the flat regions, towards the south-east of the state, intertropical savanna vegetation dominates, such as thorny scrub, grasses, cujíes and other varieties that have adapted to the conditions of the state such as &quot;Ceiba&quot;, , Caribbean pine, jabillo and carob tree. Another variation of the vegetation present in Monagas State can be found along the banks of the main rivers, where extensive forests of mangroves, palms and morichals have formed.

===Protected areas===

Cueva del Guácharo National Park was created in May 1975 by the Venezuelan government to protect the ecosystem surrounding the Guácharo Cave. The park has a surface area of and includes the mountainous areas of the municipalities of Acosta and Caripe in Monagas State and Ribero Municipality in Sucre State.

The Alexander von Humboldt National Monument is located in the park. It was created in 1949 to protect the Guácharo Cave. This national monument is named after the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the cave in 1799.

Another protected area is the Guarapiche Forestal Reserve, which protects the forests located along the banks of the Guarapiche and San Juan Rivers.

== Politics and government ==
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the state maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

Monagas has five branches of government, and is autonomous and equal to the rest of the states of the Federation:

== Demographics ==
The population of Monagas State has increased since the 1920s due to the opening of its oil fields. The majority of its inhabitants are &quot;Mestizo;&quot; that is, they result from the progeny of native Indians, Black Africans and White Europeans. Many people from neighbouring states as Sucre and Nueva Esparta, as well as persons from other countries as Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, Syrian, Lebanese and Chinese have immigrated to the state because of the petroleum industry and business opportunities. The majority of the population is concentrated in the northern area of Monagas state. At least fifty percent of inhabitants live in the capital state of Maturín. The most populated cities are Maturín (514,046), Punta de Mata (69,000), Caripe (37,350), Caripito (52,000) and Temblador (36,000).

Monagas also has inhabitants of the Warao and Kariña ethnic groups.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

== Economy ==
The main economical activity is the exploitation of oil. Many towns such as Punta de Mata, El Tejero, and Temblador depend on this activity.

Other towns such as Caripe and San Antonio live off agriculture and livestock farming. Coffee is planted in the areas next to the towns of Caripe and San Antonio. Cocoa is cultivated near Caripito. Maize, tomato, sugar-cane, tobacco, banana, rice, yucca and tropical fruits grow in other areas.

Cattle is concentrated in the southern and western parts of Monagas, where there are great extensions of savannas and plateaus.

The state has forests with its corresponding industry.

Because of the oil exploitation Maturín is a main commercial and banking centre in the east of Venezuela.

== Culture ==

Monagas state has a culture very similar to other eastern states of Venezuela. Natives of Monagas share with the population of the eastern states the quick manner of speaking the Spanish language, food, some musical rhythms as the galerón or joropo, typical clothing such as the liqui liqui of the Llanos, and veneration of the Virgin of El Valle.

=== Festivals ===

The Maturín Carnival is highlighted by the parade in the center of the city, with floats and parades made by communities, educational institutions, public agencies and private companies. After the parade, musical shows are held at the local sports complex, in addition to the ceremony of electing the Carnival Queen.

The Festival of the Virgin of the Valley is celebrated in September. Processions with the image of the Virgin of the Valley take place in several areas of the city.

The Saint Simon () Fair is held to celebrate the anniversary of the city&#x27;s foundation. It takes place in the first week of December. Shows such as dances, food exhibitions, horse shows, &quot;coleo&quot;, musical group presentations, agricultural and handicraft exhibitions are held. It takes place in the Chucho Palacios Fair Complex. It is named after Saint Simon in honour of Simon the Zealot, the patron saint of Maturín.

The event of the burning of Judas takes place on Easter Sunday, where an effigy is lit on fire. In recent years these effigies have been personalized by contemporary politicians.

The Snake of Ipure () is a typical dance in San Antonio de Capayacuar and widespread in the State of Monagas, where girls or women dressed usually in yellow and black dance in the form of the movement of a snake.

=== Dance ===
The Genarito Bull Dance is a festivity featuring several pairs of dancers, a bull, a veterinarian, a nurse, a bullfighter and musicians. The song of the Bull of Genarito is performed by Juliocesar Aguilera Simoza, a native of the town of Aguasay.

The Monkey Dance is an indigenous dance in which people hold each other by the waist, one after the other, and form lines. Guided by someone disguised as a monkey, participants walk through the streets in the manner of a human train to the Monkey Plaza. Beforehand, most of the dancers darken their faces with indigo and soot and dye their clothes with colours. They also play with water, paint, flour, Chilean blue crocus () and soot in a carnival-like manner. The monkey then invites those present to join the ritual; if they do not, the monkey will give a light slap to those who refuse. It is celebrated every year on 28 December.

The Dance of the Trembler was first performed on 15 November 1989. It consists of dancing with a (a fish, the electric eel, found in the rivers closest to the town) made of cardboard and cloth. Three people go inside the and three pairs go around it. The instruments used for this dance are a , &quot;cuatro&quot;, a drum and maracas.

===Handicrafts===

==== Curagua weaving ====
The town of Aguasay is known for its weaving that is made from a plant grown in the town, called curagua. On 2 December 2015, Venezuelan curagua fiber and weaving was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO at its annual meeting in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.

==== Moriche hammock ====
This art consists of carefully weaving the fiber of the moriche palm. Once it is and spun, this fiber is tied to special sticks and woven between them, giving it the shape of a sheet; when loops are made at the ends, it takes the form of a hammock.

====Sangrito====
The name is due to the fact that the raw material used for this handicraft is extracted from the roots of a tree that bears its name because when it is cut, its roots tend to bleed; it is easy to mould as it is a very soft and light wood. The Warao Indians use this material to mold figures of animals that live in the forests and rivers that they frequent.

====Warao craftsmanship====
Produced by the Warao Indians, according to the use given to the object, without being separated from the work element. The raw material is plant fibers, mostly moriche and wood, with which they carve figures and animals, as well as making necklaces with peonies, &quot;Mucuna&quot; seeds and Job&#x27;s tears, among other materials. In addition, they construct harpoons, buoys, shields, arrows, candles, roofs, ropes, pitchforks and bridges. The craftsmanship of the Warao reflects their organizational idiosyncrasy, as well as their world: nature, spirit, man.

====Barrancoide craftsmanship====
Its main material is clay, which after being molded is baked and painted and used for making dolls, vases, façades of houses, and other things. The items are taken to market and can be found in different parts of the state.

=== Cuisine ===
Typical dishes of Monagas state are &quot;arepa&quot; (a kind of bread made of maize), &quot;cachapa&quot; (an omelette made of maize), &quot;casabe&quot;, &quot;empanada&quot;, &quot;mondongo&quot; (a kind of soup), &quot;queso de mano&quot; (a kind of cheese), (guava jelly), and (meat grilled on a stick). Fish is a very important food in the state&#x27;s native cuisine. In Christmas is traditional to eat &quot;hallacas&quot;, &quot;pan de jamón&quot; (ham bread), &quot;torta negra&quot; (black cake), (chicken salad), and &quot;&quot; (preserved papaya). During Holy Week, (a dish made from red-footed tortoise) is common due to the belief that it is profane to eat meat at this time. Also during Holy Week, made from the school shark is common in the area of the eastern coast.

=== Religion ===

The predominant religion in the state is Christianity. Catholicism is the Christian branch which has the largest number of followers, as a consequence of the evangelization carried out by Catholic missionaries, such as the Franciscans, in the 17th and 18th centuries. The capital, Maturín, has been the seat of a Catholic diocese since 1958.

On the other hand, religious syncretism, here the mixture of Catholic rites with the rites of other faiths such as indigenous and Yoruba religions, is common. For example, it is common to find people who venerate María Lionza, the native chief Guaicaipuro and Felipe the Black.

Some Protestant churches have been established in different in around the state. Among them are Pentecostals, Lutherans, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Mormons and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Anglicans have a church in the Caripe area.

The coat of arms of the State of Monagas is divided into two quarters: in the upper quarter, on a green field, is a plow, a rake and a sickle, which are intertwined with a bundle of ears of corn, attributes of agriculture; and in the lower quarter, on the green field representing the plain and blue background intersected by the horizon, is, in the shade of a large tree, a bull symbolizing animal husbandry, and in the distance a galley of hills. A silver bar crosses diagonally through both quarters, and on it reads: &quot;Resisted with courage&quot;. The extremities of four rifles placed as a banner, appear holding the coat of arms, and between the bayonets a horse&#x27;s head turned to the right of the coat of arms. Under and between the lower part of the rifles, there is a red and black ribbon, representative of the war to the death, and in it a broken key symbolizing that its capital was forced, but never surrendered.

<text>The Nueva Esparta State (in Spanish: &quot;Estado Nueva Esparta&quot;, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. It comprises Margarita Island, Coche, and the lightly inhabited Cubagua.

The state is located off the northeast Caribbean coast of Venezuela. The main island of Margarita has an area of . Its capital city is La Asunción, and the main urban center is Porlamar.

== Etymology ==

Its name, Nueva Esparta (&quot;New Sparta&quot;), comes from the heroism shown by its inhabitants during the Venezuelan War of Independence, deemed similar to that of the Spartan soldiers of Ancient Greece.

==History==
===Spanish colonization===
Margarita was discovered on August 15, 1498, during Columbus&#x27; third voyage. On that trip the Admiral would also discover mainland Venezuela. That day, Columbus saw three islands, two of them small, low and arid (the current Coche and Cubagua), separated by a channel from a third, larger one, covered with vegetation and populated by indigenous people who called it &quot;Paraguachoa&quot;, a word that means &quot;fish in abundance&quot; according to historians, and &quot;sea people&quot; according to others.

Columbus named the island &quot;La Asunción&quot;, because it was discovered on the religious date of the Virgin that bears his name. The following year, in 1499, Pedro Alonso Niño and Cristóbal Guerra renamed it &quot;La Margarita&quot;, due to the abundance of pearls found in the region; other hypotheses suggest that the name Margarita refers to Queen Margarita of Austria-Styria.

Shortly after its discovery, other European sailors confirmed the existence of rich pearl deposits in Cubagua, whose exploitation gave rise to the first Spanish establishment in Venezuela. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, in 1500, only 2 years after his sighting, there were already 50 adventurers installed in Cubagua who were eagerly looking for the precious mother-of-pearl gems used by the natives in their personal ornaments. This settlement of small Spanish villages for the exploitation of these pearl riches in Cubagua consisted of Cabildo and Regidores by 1510. But the settlement was carried out in this early date spontaneously without following Hispanic patterns, since even in 1517, it is indicated that the population resided in awnings and huts.

At first, all official attempts to achieve the colonization of Cubagua failed: the problem of water supply was paramount, and it was concluded that the establishment of a village in Cubagua could not bear fruit without the previous construction of a fortress at the mouth of the river of today&#x27;s Cumaná, which was the one that supplied the water.

Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés&#x27; version that the establishment of Cubagua dates back to 1517 is considered correct. Under the protection of the Cumaná fortress, which was finally built in early 1523, the village of Cubagua was quickly organized and an extraordinary boom emerged in the exploitation of pearl pleasures.
It is unlikely that before 1525, the residents of the village of Cubagua were aware of being a town or city. None of the pearl records from 1521 to 1525, which are the first known local sources of Cubagua, mention the name of the village on this island, and only speak of Cubagua.

In 1526, the town was elevated to the category of Villa with the name of &quot;&quot;Villa de Santiago de Cubagua&quot;, although it seems that this title was never used. On September 13, 1528, this town was granted the rank of city, was given a coat of arms, the first ordinances were issued granting the city political autonomy and its name was changed to &quot;Nueva Cádiz&quot;&quot;. Through these ordinances, the city of Nueva Cádiz, today recognized as the first city of Venezuela, did not depend on Spanish aid from Santo Domingo, and could trade directly with Castile. This helped the inhabitants of Nueva Cádiz to stimulate their activity. They set about building their city, replacing the huts with stone houses, material brought from Araya, and increasing the number of inhabitants.

Between 1531 and 1532, the pearly beds showed the first signs of exhaustion. The growing population with scarce means of living, created in New Cadiz problems of supply of food, water and firewood. Foodstuffs arrived from Santo Domingo, water from the Manzanares River in Cumaná, and firewood was transported from Isla Margarita. When pearls were scarce, they sought new fisheries, and with the authorization of the Royal Court of Santo Domingo and King Carlos I, they moved to Cabo de la Vela.

The disappearance of the Cubagua population was a slow process due mainly to the lack of water, the resistance of the Indians to the exhausting work of the pearl fisheries, and to the conquests of distant lands. The visit of the French corsairs meant a serious threat to the survival of the city. Likewise, Caribbean boats prowled the contours of the island. However, the fundamental cause of Cubagua&#x27;s depopulation was the disappearance of the oyster beds.

The population did not migrate all at once. Coinciding with the boom in fisheries in Cubagua there is already a migration to Cabo de la Vela, because there were not enough of them in Cubagua. By 1537, the island was becoming depopulated and in 1541, history indicates that a hurricane hit the island, possibly following an earthquake, and its inhabitants fled to Margarita and founded a town. In 1543, French pirates arrived at the ruins of Nueva Cádiz, where some 10 inhabitants still remained, and left the city in flames, causing the island to be abandoned once again.
Although the exact date of its total abandonment by the Spaniards in this early period is not known, history indicates that by 1545, a group of residents of Nueva Cádiz aspire to incorporate Margarita under their jurisdiction, which confirms the existence of a population on the island at least for that date.

In 1676, the Marquis of Maitenon with a fleet of 10 ships and 800 French buccaneers attacked Margarita Island and Cumaná. This action motivated the Spanish to build several forts on the island.

The Province of Margarita is the oldest of those that in 1777 formed the Captaincy General of Venezuela. It had depended on the Royal Audience of Santo Domingo until 1739, when it was annexed to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, along with other States; and in 1830, when the Republic of Venezuela emerged, it was one of its 13 original provinces.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the Church of Santa Ana, an Assembly of Notables was held on May 6, 1816, in which the Third Republic of Venezuela was proclaimed as a single and indivisible nation: the Provisional Government of the Republic was established, the General Simón Bolívar proclaimed the Supreme Chief of the Republic, General Santiago Mariño was appointed second in command, and various military promotions are made. Bolívar signs the repeal of the Death War Decree of 1813. Inside the Church, the chair where General Bolivar sat down still remains, and monuments to those who participated in the assembly.

In 1835, the province of Margarita was divided into the cantons of La Asunción (composed of the parishes of Paraguachí, Pampatar, Los Robles, El Valle and Porlamar) and Norte (composed of the parishes of Tacarigua, Juangriego, San Juan, Pedro González and Sabana Grande).

In 1856, the province of Margarita was divided into the cantons of Norte (composed of the parishes of Norte, Juangriego, Tacarigua, Pedro González, Los Hatos, Pedregales, San Juan and the islands of Tortuga, Blanquilla, Testigos and Aves de Barlovento), with its capital in Santa Ana del Norte, and Sur (composed of the parishes of Asunción, Pampatar, Porlamar, Paraguachí, Espíritu Santo, Robles, and Sabana Grande), with its capital in La Asunción.

In 1864, when the country was divided into 20 states and a Federal District, Margarita took the name of Estado Nueva Esparta (&quot;State of New Sparta&quot;). The republic granted the title of &quot;Nueva Esparta&quot; to the island territory because of the heroism shown by the island&#x27;s inhabitants in the struggle for Venezuela&#x27;s independence, which resembled the Spartans of classical Greece. The complete exhaustion of the Cubagua pearl oysters in 1857 determined the abandonment of this island, and afterwards, it was visited by fishermen who built &quot;rancherías&quot; (ranches). In 1881, it became a section of the Great State of Guzmán Blanco (called Miranda from 1889 to 1898). In 1901, two years after the autonomy of the states was restored, it regained the name of Nueva Esparta, but lost it again between 1904 and 1909, during which time it was included in the Federal District as an Eastern Section. Finally, in 1909, it regained its statehood and in 1948, the island of Cubagua was annexed to its territory.

== Geography ==

The main island of Margarita has an area of . Its capital city is La Asunción. The main urban center is Porlamar. Other important towns are Juan Griego, Pampatar (home of the Port Authority), Punta de Piedras, San Juan Bautista, Las Guevaras, Las Hernández, Villa Rosa, Bella Vista (Margarita), and El Valle del Espíritu Santo.

Nueva Esparta is located between the coordinates 10º44, 11º10` of North latitude and 63º (degrees) 46` (minutes), 64º13` of West longitude, in the insular region of the country.

The State is limited in all its cardinal points by the Caribbean Sea.

Together, the three islands of the State bring together magnificent beaches, wonderful mangroves and other landscapes that make it a true island paradise. Margarita, the largest of them, has a maximum elevation on Copey Hill (900 meters above sea level) and includes the Macanao mountain core to the west. Coche and Cubagua are rocky cores covered with marine sediments and have a flat relief, with cliffs. The climate is arid or semi-arid, to the point that there are no permanent current rivers. The Nueva Esparta state is divided into 11 municipalities.

===Municipalities===
===Geology===
The state territory is characterized by events of volcanism, sedimentation, emersion, deposition and uprising. Igneous-metamorphic rocks of the Mesozoic era form the foundation of the mountainous areas and their foothills, including the hill landscape, with the exception of the undulating reliefs of Pampatar, constituted by tertiary sediments, as well as the coastal plain. The lowest marine areas are Pleistocene and Holocene formations, composed of alluviums, coastal and alluvial terraces, calcareous sandstones and lagoon deposits. Coche and Cubagua are rocky cores covered with marine sediments from the Pre-Cambrian geological era.

===Relief===
The eastern sector of Margarita Island has three small mountain ranges, aligned in a southeast–northwest direction, whose altitude stops are the Copey, Matasiete, La Guardia and Guayamurí hills; To the southwest, the relief is flat, with the exception of moderate elevations, known as Las Tetas de María Guevara. The Macanao Peninsula, in the western sector, has an elongated east–west massif, between the Macanao and Guarataro hills. The rest are coastal plains that descend towards wide-ranging beaches. The islands of Coche and Cubagua offer a flat terrain with some cliffs.

The relief is composed of coastal plains, lagoons and mountain ranges. The coastal plains of the eastern massif descend to oceanic beaches of great breadth and white sands that constitute a great tourist attraction, also conducive to sports and recreation activities.
Among the highest elevations found in the state, there are:

===Hydrography===
There are no significant permanent water currents, but thin rivers lately seasonal due to climatic changes that have raised temperatures throughout the planet in recent years. Dry most of the year and with torrential in short periods of rain. Of these, the main ones are San Juan (San Juan poses), San Francisco, La Asunción, El Valle, Chaguaramal, El Muco, La Vieja, Negro and Tacarigua.

The lagoons of La Restinga, Los Mártires and Las Marites, together with the hot springs of the Holy Spirit Valley and the San Francisco sector, complete a scarce, insufficient and unsuitable hydrographic system to supply the local population with potable water.

===Climate===

Nueva Esparta has a hot semi-arid climate, with microclimates ranging from very warm arid to warm-moderate semi-arid. The semi-arid climate dominates in Margarita. In Porlamar, the rainfall is only annually with an average temperature of . The areas with the highest rainfall are located in the Serranía de El Copey, reaching per year. This, together with local fogs, allows the development of cloud forests, which derive on lower slopes in formations of premontane dry forests. Precipitation is lower in the Macanao Peninsula, ranging from annually, with temperatures from . In Coche, the average annual temperature is also high with rainfall of annually. Dry conditions are rigorous in Cubagua with only of rainfall per year, qualifying as a hot arid climate. If it is considered that in the coastal and beach sites, such as Porlamar, there are only 66 days of appreciable rainfall per year, the optimal conditions for various types of tourism are experienced. Some examples of its climate are Cerro Copey, Laguna de la Restinga, Macanao peninsula, and the islands of Coche and Cubagua.

On rare occasions, tropical cyclones affect the islands of the state due to their low latitude. Some cyclones that have affected the islands either directly or indirectly have been Hurricane Joan–Miriam in 1988 and Tropical Storm Bret in 1993.

===Soils===
The soil is thin and underdeveloped, subject to an intense erosive process due to overgrazing. The oscillations of the sea level and the deforestation carried out for agricultural use contribute to this. The valleys&#x27; soils, the best quality lands, are well developed, have an organic layer, are protected from the erosive action of the wind and are covered with vegetation, but only occupy a small proportion of the state. In the areas of Piedmont, the cones of injection and colluvial materials give rise to very stony soils. The islands of Coche and Cubagua have soils with salinity and strong erosion, resulting from the action of the winds, which gives their surface layer a stony character.

===Vegetation===

On Margarita Island, the climatic and / or edaphic effects have produced a mixture of life zones, with varied ecosystems that range from tropical desert weeds, in low and dry areas, to thorny mountains and tropical dry forest in areas of greater height. In the Copey hill is the premontane humid forest and in the swampy and saline areas mangroves abound. The most representative species are olive trees, divi-divi and pardillo, around the hills Matasiete, El Copey, and Guaraguao. The very dry forest is in areas of very intervened vegetation. The main species are: cují, guatacare, guamache, cardón, divisive and olive. The spines and desert weeds, dominant formations of the state, occupy the coastal plains. Its main species are abrojo, cují, yaque, oregano, naked Indian, prickly pear, cardon, divisive, guamache and others. Mangrove concentrations are located in La Restinga, Las Marites and other coastal water areas. The most important species are the red mangrove, button and the black mangrove.

Most of the state presents a vegetation corresponding to the insular coastal subregion of the type:
* Halophilic Coastal Herbazales: in low, open communities, in saline depressions of the coast, floristically poor (glass, glass grass, rabbit broom).
* Herbazales Litorales Psamófilos: (yerba de grama – Batatilla de Playa).
* Coastal Xerophilic shrubs: Cují, Yaque, Cuica, Yabo, Palo Verde, Guatacaro, Gatacare, yaguarey or cord data, Guasabara, Guasabano, Tuna Guafabora, Guayacán.
* Coastal Mangroves: red mangrove, black mangrove, pink mangrove, white mangrove, button mangrove and the corresponding to the Copey mountain range.
* Low to Medium Forests: Puy, Curaro, Aragüaney, Egg Yolk, Naked Indian, Indian Hide, Torco, White Spoon, Lemongrass.
* Sub-evergreen Submontane Ombrophile Forests: Aragüaney, Chaparro Bobo, Guamo, Palmito, Palmiche, Macanilla.
*Evergreen Dwarf Submontane shrubs: Cup, White Butter.
* Agricultural and Urban Lands: natural vegetation has been removed or altered in such a way that it is no longer recognizable as such.

===Fauna===

Fauna in the region include:
* Mammals: cottontail rabbit, red-tailed squirrel, white-tailed deer, skunk, ocelot, tufted capuchin, and nine-banded armadillo.
* Birds: chachalaca, troupial, partridge, cardinal, dove
* Reptiles: iguana, rattlesnake, coral snake, anoles

The region has a great variety of animals; Among the most prominent animals of Margarita Island are:
* White-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoeilus virginianus margaritae)&quot;: This deer is estimated to have a maximum weight of about 30 kg and feeds on leaves, fruits and plant materials. It is also one of the smallest white-tailed deer subspecies. They are found mainly in the Macanao Peninsula, and in the Cerro el Copey Park, where these particular white-tailed deer are rarely seen.
*Ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis melanurus&quot;): This cat is from the family Felidae. Studies have not confirmed whether this mammal is in danger on the island, since it is rated Least Concern by the IUCN. This cat in Margarita and Venezuela is known as &quot;cunaguaro&quot;. Its general weight is 11 kg, a medium-sized feline. It feeds on young reptiles, birds, turtle eggs, monkeys, among others.

<text>Harold Gustav &quot;Hal&quot; Dick (January 19, 1907 – September 3, 1997) was an American mechanical engineer employed by Goodyear, who flew on almost all of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; flights. He was called to the UK for a meeting before the last flight of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and was not aboard during the disaster. Dick earned his balloon and dirigible pilot licenses in 1930, from Orville Wright.

Harold Dick was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and died in Wichita, Kansas, at the age of 90.

<text>Portuguesa State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. Located in the west of the Republic, it is often considered the &quot;breadbasket of Venezuela&quot; for the large amount of agricultural products produced there. The state is bordered by the state of Lara to the north, to the east by Cojedes, to the west by Trujillo and to the south by Barinas.

As of the 2011 census, it had a population of 876,496. The state capital is the city of Guanare.

==Origin of the name==
The state was designated &quot;Portuguesa&quot; on August 4, 1909, named after the Portuguesa River. The name of the river is in turn said to be derived from a local legend about a young woman of Portuguese descent who drowned in the Portuguesa River, possibly accompanying the conquistadors who founded the city of Guanare, the capital of the state.
==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
In the pre-Hispanic era, the territory of the Venezuelan plains was inhabited by groups that arrived from the Amazon region by river (probably Colombia or Ecuador).

The oldest known human presence dates to between 300 and 600 BC in Barinas and the Portuguesa plains, with the migrants perhaps attracted by the region&#x27;s relatively predictable flooding cycle.

Over the next 1200 years, these communities moved northwards and were also influenced by groups from the Orinoco. Among the traces left by these pre-Columbian inhabitants are numerous petroglyphs of geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, as well as a complex network of roads believed to have served to drain swamps or control water. They also left a system of mounds that possibly had functions of surveillance, funerary or refuge for the periods of greatest flooding.

===Spanish colonization===
Several expeditions of the Welser Family, originating in Coro under the command of Nikolaus Federmann and Georg von Spira, in the year 1534 and arriving in the Andean foothills crossed the current territory of the Llanos.

In 1542, the armies of Philipp von Hutten from Coro visited the region on their way to Barinas, but were repulsed by the Omaguas Indians and Hutten was wounded.

The Spanish conquerors Diego Ruiz de Vallejo and Juan Ruiz de Villegas explored the lands to the east of the Andes in 1549. Decades later, on November 3, 1591, Juan Fernandez de Leon founded Espiritu Santo of the Guanaguanare Valley, today&#x27;s Guanare. Its name in the indigenous language means &#x27;Place of seagulls&#x27; or &#x27;Land between rivers&#x27;.

===19th century===
The Battle of Araure, in which Simon Bolivar defeated Jose Ceballos, occurred in Portuguesa in 1813. At the time, Venezuela was under the control of the patriots in mid-1813, except for the provinces of Guayana and Maracaibo. In September 1813, the royalists received reinforcements from Cadiz, taking the offensive across the country, although the patriots&#x27; successes continued until the end of 1813.

On December 3, 1813, Simón Bolívar learned that the Royalist forces (3,500 men), under the command of Brigadier José Ceballos, had met with those of José Yáñez in the town of Araure, and as a result, he arranged for all able bodied men in El Altar and Cojedes to muster in the town of Agua Blanca.

On the 4th, the Patriots marched towards Araure and camped about 1,000 m from the village, opposite the Royalists, who had deployed at the entrance of the Acarigua River with their wings supported by a forest and a small lagoon and their back protected by a forest. The Royalists possessed ten artillery pieces.

The battle began at dawn and lasted approximately six hours. The Royalist troops were numerically superior to the Patriot troops. The Patriots captured 200 prisoners, four flags, and numerous artillery pieces. In this single clash, the Royalists lost more than 500 cavalry.

On April 10, 1851, by decree of the Congress of the Republic under the mandate of General José Gregorio Monagas, the territory that currently makes up the state of Portuguesa became a province, with Guanare as its capital.

===Federal War===
The federal war was even more devastating than the emancipatory war in the states of Portuguesa, Apure and Barinas, and especially in Portuguesa, as in addition to the outrages and loss of life in the fighting, the departures of uncontrolled guerrillas, the passions and quarrels produced more deaths and misfortunes than the combats; furthermore, the arson attacks on houses, farms and cattle yards plunged many families of the time into ruin.

In the days of this uncontrolled movement and in the vicinity of Araure, specifically in Tapa de Piedra, on April 4, 1859, a bloody combat was staged between the revolutionary forces of General Zamora and those of the conservative Manuel Herrera. After almost three hours of confrontation, Herrera lost the fight and had to flee with the survivors on the way to Ospino. Following the Federal Revolution in 1866, it was decided to unite the Zamora and Portuguesa entities into one and call it Zamora State. Later, with Antonio Guzmán Blanco in power, the territorial division was reduced to seven states, so Portuguesa became part of the South West state, along with Cojedes and Zamora.
===20th century===
At the end of the 19th century, the Restoration Revolution brought back the country&#x27;s political division into 20 states and, consequently, Portuguesa and Cojedes became Zamora again. Finally, on August 5, 1909, the National Constitution was promulgated, which established that Venezuela would be composed of a Federal District, two Federal Territories and 20 states, one of which would be Portuguesa with the capital in the city of Guanare.

Like most of the Llanos states, Portuguesa was practically isolated from the center of the country until the middle of the 20th century. The only way to move from this entity to another was by means of carts pulled by horses or oxen, or by using the waterways. After the overthrow of General Isaías Medina Angarita, the Revolutionary Government Board began to materialize the existing projects designed by the previous rulers on sustainable agricultural development based on the colonization of large areas. It was in the 1940s, when work began on the Los Llanos road, which meant the economic take-off of the region. The foundation of the Turén Agricultural Colony through the work of 20,000 immigrant refugees, mostly Italian, drove the rice plan, and the incorporation of hundreds of hectares of irrigated land were key to the development and growth of this state known as the granary of Venezuela.

Within this reality, a developmentalist model was adopted with evident influence from the United States. This model made possible the establishment of social relations of production in the agricultural sector based on capitalism. In this vein, at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, a &quot;State Project&quot; was initiated called the Turen Agricultural Unit (U.A.T.), which was successively implemented in the Turen Agricultural Colony. To this end, the government, through itinerant diplomacy, made use of the international agreements signed during the post-war period on aid to refugees and put into practice the open border policy of selective immigration promoted by General Marcos Pérez Jiménez, where Europeans (mostly Italians, Spaniards and Germans) with an agricultural tradition entered and shared work with Venezuelan citizens from various regions of the Republic. In 1949, the Agricultural Unit or Colony of Turen, the most ambitious experience of its kind ever carried out in a Caribbean country, was initiated. Located, as well as the Tovar colony, in an area of mountains, the future Granary of Venezuela sheltered, together with a minority of local farmers, a babel of immigrants from several countries. Initially, they were mainly Eastern Europeans, who arrived through the &quot;International Refugee Organization&quot;, many of them ethnic Germans from Romania, but already in the beginning of the 50&#x27;s the Italians and Germans became the relative majority of the immigrant population.

<text>The Sucre State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is Cumaná city. Sucre State covers a total surface area of and, as of the 2011 census, had a population of 896,921. The most important river in the state is the Manzanares River.

==History==

This Venezuelan State has great historical importance, because it was the first Venezuelan land that was touched by the European navigator Christopher Columbus. The latter, impressed by the greenness of the flora, the coasts and the crystalline water of its beaches, called the place &quot;Tierra de Gracia&quot;.

===Spanish colonization===
The capital of the state is Cumaná, which was founded by Gonzalo de Ocampo in 1521, although Franciscan missionaries began to populate it in 1515. In 1530 it was hit by an earthquake, so it had to be rebuilt. On July 2, 1591, King Philip II of Spain granted Cumaná the title of city.

In 1639, conflicts appeared in the Cumanacoa Valley, as the well-known conqueror Juan de Urpín, incorporated Cumanacoa into the territory of his ephemeral Governorate of New Barcelona and obtained authorization to found a colony there. On 18 February 1643 he founded the colony and gave it the name of Santa María de Cumanacoa. Some time later, the Cumanagoto tribe took over the colony and disappeared without a trace.

In the year 1700, by mandate of his Majesty Felipe V, he sent Captain Pedro Antonio Arias y González Manso to resolve the conflict in the Valley. An armed struggle begins with the indigenous tribe Cumanagotos, which maintained control of the Valley. Positioning their ships in Carúpano, the siege began up to the Valley of Cumanacoa, a conflict that lasted two years that ended up restoring order and the recovery of all the lands by the Spanish Empire, with the surrender of the indigenous tribes of the region and especially the Cumanagoto, the region of the Valley remains under the control of Captain Pedro Antonio Arias and Gonzalez Manso. 

King Felipe V, pleased with this service to the Spanish Empire, sends him Royal orders to establish himself permanently in the Valley with special powers of Governance, Justice and Commerce and to make it a territory that is not subject to the Governor of the province of Nueva Andalucía and Nueva Barcelona as well as his appointment as Señorío de San Baltazar de los Arias. In 1705 Captain Pedro Antonio Arias y González Manso founded the region of El Valle with the name of San Baltasar de los Arias, which was definitively preserved until the days of the dictatorship of General Juan Vicente Gomez.

In 1726, the province of Cumaná was composed of Cumaná, Guayana, Barcelona, Maturín and the island of Trinidad. This organization disintegrated as Guiana and Barcelona became independent provinces. In the year 1777, the Captaincy General of Venezuela was created, formed by seven provinces, among which was Cumaná.

===Contemporary era===
After the events of Caracas in April 1810, commissioners entered Cumaná, a meeting was called to establish a Provisional Board that took over the government of the Province. When Gran Colombia was dissolved and José Antonio Páez assumed the presidency of Venezuela, the country was divided into 11 provinces, one of which was Cumaná. In 1853, an earthquake once again destroyed a large part of the city.

In 1891 the so-called Great State of Bermúdez was created, until 1898, when it finally adopted the name of &quot;State of Sucre&quot;. In 1901 the State of Sucre was created, separated from Maturín, and in 1904 it was integrated again to the State of Bermúdez. By 1909 the limits of the States of Sucre and Monagas were definitively drawn as two separate entities.

The Cariaco earthquake in 1997 is considered the most serious to have occurred in Venezuela since the earthquake that affected the city of Caracas on July 27, 1967. In this last earthquake, the surface rupture that occurred in the Pilar Fault segment was particularly irregular, with cosmic displacements of approximately 0.25 m and a process of soil shaking recorded on the coast line.

==Geography==
The State of Sucre is located in the east of Venezuela. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the north, the States of Monagas and Anzoátegui to the south, the Gulf of Paria to the east and the Gulf of Cariaco to the west. The name of this Venezuelan State is a tribute to the hero of independence, Grand Marshal Antonio José de Sucre, who was born in the city of Cumaná, which is the current capital of the State. It has an area of 11,800 square kilometers, representing 1.28% of the national total of Venezuela.

The state of Sucre is located almost in the eastern cordillera; in the northern part is the double peninsula, which in the east is the peninsula of Paria and in the west is the peninsula of Araya, dividing the slopes of the rivers, which flow into the gulfs of Paria and Cariaco, respectively. The main heights of the Eastern Cordillera are Cerro Negro, Peonia, Majagual and Arrempuja, all of them at more than 1900 m., being its highest point the Turimiquire peak with its almost 2600 m.

===Municipalities===

* Andrés Eloy Blanco (Casanay)
* Andrés Mata (San José de Aerocuar)
* Arismendi (Río Caribe)
* Benítez (El Pilar)
* Bermúdez (Carúpano)
* Bolívar (Marigüitar)
* Cajigal (Yaguaraparo)
* Cruz Salmerón Acosta (Araya)
* Libertador (Tunapuy)
* Mariño (Irapa)
* Mejía (San Antonio del Golfo)
* Montes (Cumanacoa)
* Ribero (Cariaco)
* Sucre (Cumaná)
* Valdez (Güiria)

===Hydrography===
Some of the most important rivers in the State of Sucre are the following

Ríos Neverí (117 km.), which crosses the city of Barcelona, Mochima and Manzanares, the latter of 81 km. and passes through the capital city of Cumaná. All of them flow into the Caribbean Sea.

In the Gulf of Cariaco, one of the main rivers of the State, the Carinicuao or Cariaco, which is 173 km long, pours its waters. Of lesser importance, but also from the same basin are the Cautaro, Tunantal, Guaracayal, Compondrón, San Pedro and Marigüitar.
In the Caribbean Sea basin, rivers of lesser importance such as the Chaure, Caribe, Unare and Cumaná flow into the river.
Finally, after traveling 173 km, the San Juan river deposits its waters in the Gulf of Paria, as do the Irapa, Aruca, Güiria, Guiramo, Grande, Manacal and Yoco rivers.

===Relief===
The relief of Sucre State is formed especially by mountainous landscapes, with some valleys not very extensive. The Turimiquire mountain range, to the southwest, shows a rough relief, with steep slopes and heights reaching 2500 meters, while the mountainous system of the Paria Peninsula is characterized by hills of lower elevation. The coast of Sugarcane, essentially towards the west, has all the characteristics of a sinking coast, deep, with large cliffs and scarce beach formation. In contrast, towards the southeast of the entity, in the Gulf of Paria, the land is very flat, with slopes of less than 1% and with insufficient drainage, which has turned it into swampy plains.
===Vegetation===
The vegetation of Sucre State is xerophytic in the coastal areas and mountainous in the rural areas located in the Coastal Range; one can also find Caribbean beach plants and trees, such as coconut and cocoa trees, as well as the oak, which has been declared a State tree.

In Paria the vegetation ranges from cloud forest at 1000 meters and annual rainfall calculated between 1000 and 1500 millimeters, to xerophytic as we approach the coast. Its warm and rainy climate is conducive to vegetation, which according to experts is home to species transported by the waters of the Orinoco River from Guyana and native species, which are only found in this area (endemic).&quot;

===Fauna===

The conditions that prevail in the area of the Paria Peninsula favor the presence of important bird species and subspecies new to science that live only inside the park, such as the colorful earwig hummingbird. Among the mammals are the white-faced capuchin monkey and the spiny rat, as well as deer, foxes, spider monkeys and báquiros.

In the Eastern Cordillera bioregion, where almost the entire state is included Sucre, except for the muddy plain, 125 species of mammals have been recorded, equivalent to 38.2% of the national total (20). The largest number of species is found in the evergreen and cloud forests. So far no endemics have been found, and many species are common also in other nearby and distant bioregions, as is the case with the bat black mastiff (Molossus sinaloe) - also distributed in the Central Cordillera -, the two-fingered guava sloth (Choloepus didactylus), the dwarf anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), the common water mouse (Neusticomys venezuelae), the bat The Greater white bat (Diclidurus ingens) and the White-winged sucker bat (Thyroptera tricolor), species located in the deltaic and southern Orinoco bioregions.

Among the mammals reported in the bioregion, not including the Araya Peninsula find the common cachicamo (Dasypus novencinctus), the cuchicuchi (Potos flavus), the red deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Including the Araya Peninsula,
The common fox (Cerdocyon thous), the savannah rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), the common porcupine (Coendu prehensilis), the common picure (Dasyprocta leporina), the common squirrel (Sciurus granatensis) and the cardon bat (Leptonycteris curasoae).

Most mammals are bats, which have an important role in the pollination of numerous plants and in the dispersal of seeds.
The swampy plain of the Ajíes-Río San Juan stream covers a small area of the bioregion of the deltaic system, where fewer mammals have been recorded, only 96, equivalent to 29.3% of the national total. However, there is an endemic and exclusive species, the Picure deltano (Dasyprocta guamara), with a wide distribution
in the Neotropics.

In this area there are three semi-aquatic species: the water opossum (Chironectes minimus), the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), and the giant otter (Pteronura). This is an area of global importance for the distribution of the manatee (Trichechus manatus), since significant populations of this species have been found in the world.

===Climate===

In the western coastal area, a semi-arid climate can be observed, with an average annual temperature of 24-26 °C in Cumaná and rainfall of 375 mm. The Araya Peninsula is a representative area of strong climate in terms of drought and aridity conditions. In the southern parallel strip, a rainy tropical savanna climate is observed, which extends to the area of the coastal slope to the Caribbean Sea. In Carúpano, average temperatures of 26-35 °C and changing rainfall of 524–1,046 mm are observed. In the Gulf of Paria the average annual rainfall increases from 1,200 to more than 2,000 mm with a forested climate. In the area of the interior mountain range there is a section where the tropical climate prevails at high altitudes.

==Government and politics==


The State is autonomous and equal in political terms to the rest of the Republic. It organizes its administration and public powers through the Constitution of the State of Sucre, dictated by the Legislative Council and published in the special official gazette of the State of Sucre, number 742, on November 13, 2002.

On the south coast of the peninsula of Paria requires special mention those of Macuro, Yacua, Mapire, Rio Grande and Cauranta.

The beaches of Araya are preferred for windsurfing, favoured by the constant winds, and inns have been established in their vicinity. The swampy plain is ideal for walks through the waterways, leaving from the Ajíes wharf or from Iraq mainly. The diversity and abundance of bird life offers conditions for birding in all national parks and outside of them, such is the case in Chacopata Bay.

The thermal waters between Cariaco and Casanay have been used and conditioned as spas, including Poza Azul and Poza Cristal, in the vicinity of Cariaco. Adjacent to the BuenaVista lagoon is the Aguas de Moisés complex; the sulphur springs of El Pilar, Cachamaure in the vicinity of San Antonio del Golfo and Aguas Calientes in Santa Ana.

<text>Táchira State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is San Cristóbal.

Táchira State covers a total surface area of and as of the 2011 census, had a population of 1,168,908. At the end of the 19th century, Táchira State was where oil was discovered in Venezuela. Currently, its main economic revenues come from the production of coffee and pineapple. The cattle and agricultural activities play an important role in Táchira&#x27;s economy. There is also a strong industrial sector which focuses on the processing of potato, sugar, milk, and cheese and the production of textiles.

Táchira State is one of the three Venezuelan Andean states (the other two are Mérida and Trujillo). This state borders Zulia State to the north, Barinas and Mérida States to the east, Apure and Barinas States to the south, and Colombia (Norte de Santander Department) to the west.
==Etymology==
Possible origins have been identified for the word Táchira, so one hypothesis states that the word is an indigenous word - based on Chibcha dialects - composed of three particles: ta, &quot;farm&quot; (as a root), chi, &quot;ours, which belongs to us&quot; and the suffix rá, &quot;element that expresses place, moment or position (...)&quot; with respect to the future. Thus, it would mean approximately a term like: &quot;The land that will be our inheritance&quot; or &quot;The land of our inheritance&quot;.

On the other hand, it is believed that Táchira comes from a Chibcha word that comes from the term &quot;tachure&quot;, which identifies a purple dye plant that has medicinal uses, known as tun-túa or sibidigua (Jatropa gossypifolia).

==History==

===Spanish colonization===
Populated mainly by groups of Timote, Cuica and Chibcha origin and as the Machirí, Umuquena and Táriba, the territory was extensively colonized in the sixteenth century.

With the foundation of San Cristóbal in 1561 by Captain Juan Maldonado Ordoñez y Villaquirán and La Grita in 1576 by Francisco de Cáceres, the agricultural exploitation of the area began, giving rise to the creation of new settlements. Since its foundation in 1576, La Grita was the capital of the province of La Grita, so the importance of this city was primitive in the region until the arrival of European trading companies to the state, which settled mainly in the more accessible and better communicated San Cristóbal.

In 1781 Juan Jose Garcia de Hevia led the Insurrection of the Communards of Los Andes, an anti-colonial revolutionary movement that sought to liberate Venezuela from the colonialism of the Spanish Empire, under the search for tax relief.

During the Venezuelan War of Independence, Simon Bolivar invaded the country through the Táchira in his Admirable Campaign.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Despite the progressive population growth of the region, its importance as Venezuela&#x27;s main coffee producer for over two hundred years and the arrival of important European trading houses in the 19th century, the state remained relatively isolated from the rest of the country, with greater cultural influence received from Colombia for many years.

In a country that now depends on an economy based on oil income, the Táchira was privileged to have the first oil wells in Venezuela. At the end of the 19th century the national oil industry was born in the place now called La Petrolia.

On March 11, 1856, by decree of the Sovereign Congress of the Republic, the province of Táchira was created, formed with the cantons of San Cristóbal, San Antonio, Lobatera and La Grita. It was decided that the capital of the Province would be San Cristóbal and there the headquarters of all the organs of the Provincial Government were established, with a general population of 42,731 inhabitants.
The decree of the congress with date 11 of March was sanctioned by the National Executive day 14. General Jose Tadeo Monagas governed in the Country, who named to exercise the position of the Province, to the citizen Pascual Casanova, assuming the position of Governor of the State Táchira, this civil employee was named May 9 being sworn in its position the 1 of July 1856.

In 1881, during the second presidency of General Antonio Guzmán Blanco, the National Constitution was reformed, establishing that the Republic is composed of nine great States; one of them was the great State of the Andes, with the sections Trujillo, Mérida and Táchira, each section being divided into districts. The executive power of the Táchira section was exercised by General Rosendo Medina, who was replaced by General Francisco Alvarado, who was short-lived because President Guzmán Blanco imposed his delegate in the Táchira, General Marcos Rodríguez. The arrival of General Ignacio Andrade to the presidency of the Republic favored the State, since the first National Magistrate to weaken the political-administrative structures of former President Joaquín Crespo, influenced the Congress to achieve a new territorial division.

In 1895, the Gran Ferrocarril del Táchira was inaugurated, its construction began in 1893 with an extension of 105 kilometers between La Fría and Encontrados to mobilize the great crops of Tachira coffee.

In 1899, Cipriano Castro began the invasion of Venezuela from the State of Táchira with an armed group that confronted the regime of Ignacio Andrade. The successive presidents of Venezuela of Tachira origin initiate a process of greater integration of the state to the country with the construction of better communication routes and the implementation of control measures on the agricultural trade of the state that was almost totally exported.
Táchira State plays an important role in the early parts of Venezuelan history. This state produced more presidents than any other state during the 20th century: Cipriano Castro, Juan Vicente Gómez, Marcos Pérez Jiménez, Isaías Medina Angarita, Eleazar López Contreras, Carlos Andrés Pérez, and Ramón José Velásquez.

At the end of the 19th century, the people of Táchira State were tired of being left out of the main country&#x27;s decisions. Consequently, a group of men decided to start a revolution called the &quot;Revolución Restauradora&quot; (The Restorative Revolution). The idea was to take power and enhance the importance of the Andean Region in the country. It was led by Cipriano Castro and was successful.

Until the start of the 20th century, it was highly difficult traveling between Táchira State and others and even within the state itself. This condition led to cultural differences between the people of Táchira and those from the rest of Venezuela. The former were more influenced by Colombian culture, a more accessible region through Norte de Santander province.

===Territorial History===

*In 1856 it was part of the province of Táchira within the territories of La Grita, Lobatera, San Antonio and San Cristóbal.
*In 1863 it acquired the category of State, a fact that was ratified in 1864 when it became part, as an independent state, of the United States of Venezuela.
*Between 1867 and 1868 it was part of the State of Zulia.
*In 1881, when the country was divided into 9 states, it became part, together with Guzmán (Mérida) and Trujillo, of the Great State of Los Andes.
*In 1899, the State of Los Andes was dissolved and Táchira recovered its status as an independent State, which it maintains to this day.
*It has remained a state since 1899, although like other states in Venezuela it did not achieve full autonomy until the early 1990s.

==Geography==
Táchira State is located in the Andes. Its highest point is La Montaña el Pulpito, which about 3995 meters above the sea level. Táchira&#x27;s population is mainly located in San Cristóbal, the most important and prosperous city of this state. Tariba, Rubio, Colon, and La Grita are also other important urban centers in this state.
It has international borders with Colombia in the west and south with Norte de Santander Department. Zulia and Mérida States lie to the north, and Barinas and Apure States lie to the east.

The main peaks are:

* The Pulpit: 3,912 m
* Moor Battalion: 3,507 m
* The Tama: 3,450 m
* Moor La Negra: 3,450 m
* Moor The Zumbador: 2,850 m

Crossed by the extension of the Andes mountain range from south to northwest, it divides the state into three different regions with a particular climate:

*Mountain circuit; in this region are the main urban settlements in the state, the climate is temperate at high altitude8 in most of the region and high moorland at elevations above 3000 meters above sea level, with slight variations throughout the year, has a clear rainy season from May to October. The orography is uneven and influenced by the course of numerous rivers and streams that form valleys at the base of the mountains, as an example the capital city is settled on the valley of the river Torbes, this area represents most of the surface of the state. The main cities located in this area are San Cristóbal, Táriba, Michelena, Rubio and La Grita.
*Pan-American circuit: this zone is located mainly in the north of the state, it shares the climatic characteristics of the southern region of the lake (of Maracaibo), with a tropical jungle climate, high rainfall and high temperatures. This region is one of the main centers of livestock production in Venezuela. It is on the border of the states of Zulia and Mérida. The main populations of this region are: La Fría, La Tendida and Coloncito.
*Llanos region: a small part of the Venezuelan plains are briefly located southeast of the state of Táchira, on the border with the states of Apure and Barinas, the climate is tropical savannah, with less humidity than in the Pan-American zone, it is also a region of high livestock production. Its main populations are: La Pedrera, El Piñal and Abejales.

===Relief===
Its territory has an area of 11,100 km2, where the Andean physiographic character predominates, with heights above 2,000 m. The mountainous relief is the southern continuation of the Mérida mountain range, which penetrates from the north in a southwesterly direction, exceeding 4,000 m in the La Negra moor.

In the extreme southwest, the Táchira depression was formed, which includes the tectonic trench through which the river of the same name runs and the entire relatively low area located between this trench and the valleys of the Lobaterita, the Torbes Medio and the Quinimarí Medio. The depression of the Torbes River separates the main range of the Mérida Range from the Tamá Range. During the Tertiary period, the uplifts of failed blocks formed deep valleys like those of the Uribante and Torbes rivers, with very steep slopes. In addition, there are relatively open basins with gently sloping terrain (San Cristóbal-Táriba-Rubio). The northern slopes come into contact with the lowlands located south of Lake Maracaibo, with large marshy areas, while the southeastern sector, from the eastern slope of the Uribante branch, is a transition zone between the piedmont (the lowlands of the mountainous formation) and the western high plains.

===Climate===
The climate presents great variations, mainly due to the modifications by the height, in populations of the route to the plain, in the piedmont (El Piñal, San Joaquin de Navay among others), can reach temperatures of 30 °C like in the Pan-American route (La Fría, Coloncito). In the capital, San Cristóbal, the average daytime temperature is 24 °C and the nighttime temperature is 18 °C. However, in cities like Pregonero, El Cobre, La Grita and others located at higher altitudes, the temperature is considerably lower (up to 10 °C).

===Vegetation===

The mountain vegetation includes specimens such as the Lasso pine and eucalyptus. The apamates and the creole cedar are abundant. Mangos, guamas, pomarrosas, guavas and other fruit trees are common in most of the state.

===Hydrography===
The hydrography is varied, there are several rivers of considerable course; the Torbes river, the Caparo river, the Uribante and the Doradas rivers among others, there are also some lakes and reservoirs, like the Uribante reservoir, the Caparo reservoir, the Garcia lagoon, the Rosal lagoon, the Ríobobo lagoon, among others.

===Extreme geographical landmarks===
Far North, confluence of the Rio Grande with the Rio Escalante (Pan-American); Far South, confluence of the Rio Burgua with the Los Pensamientos stream (Fernández Feo); Far East, confluence of the Rio Doradas (Cauce Viejo) with the Rio Caparo (Libertador); Far West, eastern bank of the Rio Táchira in front of the Cerrito, village Sabana Larga (Pedro María Ureña). Distance between the extreme points of the State: north-south, 147.88 km; east-west: 129.03 km.

===Geology===
The Tachira Andes were formed during the Eocene period (between 56 million and 40 million years ago approximately), when the Nazca tectonic plate and the Caribbean plate began to slowly slide under the South American plate, raising older formations and bending the sedimentary and igneous rocks that form today&#x27;s mountains (several of the highest peaks and moors in the State of Tachira are from the Phanerozoic eon, from the Precambrian period, about 539 million years ago).

The tectonic forces generated by this collision created: the shapes of the highest mountains and peaks (El Pico El Púlpito, 3,912 m, in the northeastern end, and Cerro El Cobre, 3,612 m, in the southwestern end. Both are known as &#x27;The Guardian Pillars of the Tachira&#x27;); a tectonic depression (known as the Tachira Depression, from the Pliocene); intramountain areas surrounded by higher ground, known as valleys (from the Pleistocene era). These are where the largest towns and cities are located); and the plains or lowlands of the north - lakes or the lake - and the south of the state - river plains - (areas of piedmont formed between the Miocene and Pliocene).

*Highest point: El Púlpito Peak (3,912 m, Páramo de Batallón Mountain Range, Jáuregui and Uribante Municipalities).

==Government and politics==

The State is autonomous and equal in political terms to the rest of Venezuela, its administration and public powers are organized through the Constitution of the State of Táchira, approved by the Legislative Council and published in the extraordinary official gazette of the State of Táchira, number 778, on February 9, 2001.
===Executive power===
It is composed of the Governor of Táchira and a group of state secretaries. The Governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and has the possibility of re-election for equal periods and a recall referendum in the middle of his term, being in charge of the state administration.

The State chooses its own Legislative Council as well as a Governor who is the Chief Executive of the State and is elected every 4 years; as of 1989, before that year he was elected by the President in office, his last Governor appointed by President Carlos Andrés Peréz, was Governor Jorge Enrique Romero, since 1989 he is chosen under direct elections, the current Governor Laidy Gómez is elected for the period (2017 - 2021) with the support of her party AD and other political organizations related to the Venezuelan opposition.

===Legislative Council===

The State Legislature is the responsibility of the unicameral Legislative Council of the State of Táchira, elected by the people by direct and secret vote every (4) four years, and they may be re-elected for new consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the State and its municipalities. The State has 13 legislators.
===State Police===

The state of Táchira, in accordance with Article 164 of the Venezuelan Constitution and Article 45 of the Constitution of the state of Táchira of 2014, has its own police force, called Politáchira, created in July 1960. Its functions are regulated by state and national laws, namely the Law of the Autonomous Institute of Police of the State of Táchira, the former; and the Organic Law of the Police Service, the latter. It reports to the Secretariat of State Security and is primarily responsible for regional security.

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains control over own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

Currently the Colombian channels are transmitted as Channel 1, Citytv and Channel TRO for this state.

===Radio===
The radio is the most traditional means of communication in the state, the first receptions were made through the radio service of Venezuela in 1926. In 1933, Radio Táchira, with a small transmitter with a range of less than one kilometer, began to operate informally in the state capital.10 It was the first radio station in the region and one of the pioneers of radio in Venezuela; later, in 1935, it began its formal transmissions, La Voz del Táchira (called Radio Táchira since 1971). Among the most representative capital stations (in AM) are Ecos del Torbes (founded in 1947), which can currently be heard from anywhere in the world and has its own news website; there are also the stations Radio Táchira, Radio Noticias 1060 (formerly Ondas de América and Radio San Cristóbal (in operation since 1954) that belong to the same González Lovera radio circuit and Radio San Sebastián.

In the interior of the state, radio has also reached an important development. Thus, as early as 1954 in the city of Rubio, the station Ecos de Junín began to broadcast, which was later taken to San Cristóbal. In 1965, Radio Frontera emerged in San Antonio del Táchira and in 1970 Radio Sucesos de Táriba and Radio el Sol de La Fría.

FM began to develop in the 1990s with the launch of station 102.1 Stereo, known today as La Mega 102.1FM (currently part of the Mega Circuit). Since then, FM has been widely developed both in the capital and in the interior of the state.

<text>Trujillo State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. Its capital is Trujillo and the largest city is Valera. The state is divided into 20 municipalities and 93 parishes. Trujillo State covers a total surface area of and, has a 2011 census population of 686,367.

==History==
===Spanish colonization===
The city of Trujillo was founded in 1557 by the conquistador and captain Diego García de Paredes, in honor of his homonymous and native town located in Extremadura, Spain. Hostility from the Kuikas Indians and natural calamities forced changes in settlement, but on 27 October 1570 the town was finally located under the temporary name of Trujillo de Nuestra Señora de la Paz. It is also known as the Portable City because of its many foundations due to the fierce resistance of the indigenous people who inhabited that territory when defending their lands.

On 31 December 1676, Maracaibo (separated from the province of Venezuela) and Mérida-La Grita are united in a government, which includes in its territory the current state of Trujillo, called the Province of Mérida del Espíritu Santo of Maracaibo (capital in Mérida) dependent on the Audiencia of Bogotá.

In 1677 the French pirate Michel de Grandmont sacked the city of Trujillo after subduing Maracaibo and Gibraltar on the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo. In 1678 Governor Jorge de Madureira moves the capital from Merida to Maracaibo and changes the name to Province of Maracaibo.

On September 8, 1777, King Carlos III created the Captaincy General of Venezuela by Royal Decree, adding the surrounding provinces to his jurisdiction &quot;in the governmental and military field&quot; and ordering the governors of those provinces to &quot;obey&quot; the Captain General and &quot;carry out his orders&quot;. The provinces of Cumaná, Maracaibo, Guayana, Trinidad and Margarita are separated from the viceroyalty of New Granada and united with the province of Venezuela. In addition, those of Maracaibo and Guayana pass from the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Bogotá to that of Santo Domingo, to which the others already belong.

It was part of the Province of Caracas until 1786, when it became an integral part of the Province of Maracaibo. A Royal Decree of February 15, 1786, ordered the transfer of the city of Trujillo from the governorship of Caracas to that of Maracaibo. The same document separated the city of Barinas from Maracaibo, choosing it as a separate province.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1810 the city and district of Trujillo separated from the Province of Maracaibo to create a new province, which would be a signatory of the Venezuelan Independence Act in 1811.

On June 15, 1813, Simón Bolívar, the Liberator, signs in the town of Trujillo at 3:00 am the Decree of War to Death against the Spaniards and the Canaries until they were granted freedom, which makes Trujillo a very important city in the history and the War of Independence of Venezuela.

On July 2, 1813, the patriots, under the command of Colonel José Félix Ribas, defeated the royalists in the battle of Niquitao in the framework of the Admirable Campaign.

On November 27, 1820, in the town of Santa Ana de Trujillo, Simón Bolívar and Captain General Pablo Morillo sign the Treaty of Armistice and Regularization of the War. By means of these treaties the war to death was officially repealed, a truce of six months was agreed in addition to constituting a de facto recognition of the Great Colombia by the crown of Spain.

When Venezuela separated from Gran Colombia in 1830, the Department of Zulia was renamed the Province of Maracaibo. The provinces of Merida and Coro were immediately separated, leaving the province composed only of the sections Zulia and Trujillo.

In 1831 the province of Trujillo was constituted by separating from the province of Maracaibo which was composed only of the Zulia section. The state of Trujillo was created in 1863, as it would be during the government of Juan Vicente Gómez, when he created more states after being diminished by Cipriano Castro.

Between 1859 and 1864, during the Federal War, the state was strangely divided into two factions, the conservatives of Jajó and the liberals of Santiago. In 1863 the state was created as Trujillo, formed by the former province of Trujillo that had been created in 1810, with the territory that had been assigned to it in 1856: Trujillo, Escuque, Boconó and Carache. In that same year it was called the Sovereign State of Los Andes; but the Constitution of 1864 recognizes it as the state of Trujillo. In 1881 it is part, together with Mérida and Táchira, of the Great State of Los Andes.

In 1887, the port of La Ceiba became very important when the Gran Ferrocarril La Ceiba-Sabana de Mendoza began operations and later in 1895 it was extended to Motatán. In 1898, it was separated and organized again as Trujillo State, giving itself a new Constitution in 1899; with this denomination it has continued until today.

The railway line begins to lose importance in 1925 with the inauguration of the Trasandina Highway, as well as the progressive decrease of coffee production in Venezuela. In the era of President Juan Vicente Gómez, the population of Trujillo was almost entirely foreign and commercial, but after its fall, its cultural development began. The Ateneo de Trujillo (Kuikas complex) is an example, little by little this population became a city and capital of the state. Among other towns, the most important are Boconó and Valera, both of which are great tourist attractions.

==Geography==

The state of Trujillo is mainly mountainous as it is crossed from southwest to northeast by the Andes mountain range, although it also has hills and plains.

The Andes Mountains are divided here into three branches, these are separated by the Motatan and Boconó valleys. The highlight of the state is the 4,006 m Teta de Niquitao. The plains are the Sabanas de Monay and the plains of El Cenizo. The shores that border Lake Maracaibo are swampy. Trujillo State is the smallest of the Andean states, and the one with the lowest absolute population as well, although its density is higher than Merida State. It is located in western Venezuela.

===Limits===
The boundaries of the state of Trujillo are:

*To the north, it borders the states of Zulia and Lara.
*To the South, it borders the states of Merida and Barinas.
*To the East, it borders the State of Portuguesa
*To the West, it borders on the State of Zulia and has coasts on the Lake of Maracaibo.

===Relief===

The relief is rugged because it is located in the Venezuelan Andes (Sierra de Merida), which is part of the great Andes Mountains, although it has a vast flat region in the depression of Lake Maracaibo.

===Climate===
The climate is tropical mountainous, and the temperature can be between 20° and 10 °C approximately. However, there are areas such as Monay where the temperature can reach 32 °C and in the páramo area, such as the Riecito area at the border of the Urdaneta, Boconó, and Trujillo municipalities, where the average temperature drops to 4 °C. The relief favors the formation of a series of local climates, where the winds play a very important role, penetrating the state from the northeast, as well as from the east. The predominant climate in almost the entire state corresponds, according to Köeppen&#x27;s classification, to a savanna climate (Aw), with an average annual temperature in the state capital of approximately 23.5 °C and rainfall of up to 936 mm per year. Soils Despite its traditionally agricultural character, the state of Trujillo has a limited amount of land suitable for agriculture. The presence of large mountain areas is a determining factor in this limitation. However, the State Management Plan states that 64.5% of the territory has good conditions for the implementation of a variety of agricultural production systems of a certain intensity, and that the remaining 35.5% is covered by natural protective vegetation. The development of an intensive agriculture must be subordinated to conservation practices of the resources involved, that is why three levels of preservation of lands with potential for agricultural activity are proposed: maximum, medium and low, expressing each one of them different degrees of flexibility in the defense of the soil resource.

===Hydrography===

Rivers
*Motatan River
*Carache River
*Boconó River
*Burate River
*River Castan
*Jimenez River
*River Caus
*Rio Pocó
*Piedras Negras River
*Escuque River, known as the Quebrada de Escuque.

==Government and politics==

Like other states, the structure of the government of Trujillo is laid out in the Constitution, the highest law in the state.

=== Executive Power ===
It is composed by the Governor of the State of Trujillo and a group of State Secretaries chosen by him to assist him in the government functions. The Governor is elected by the people through direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of one or more reelections as of 2009 for an equal period, being in charge of the state administration.
Since 1989 the Governors are chosen in direct elections by the people, the current Trujillo Government is led by Henry Rangel Silva.

=== Legislative Power ===
The state legislature is the unicameral Legislative Council of the State of Trujillo, elected by the people through a universal, direct and secret vote every four years, with the possibility of being reelected for other consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the state and its municipalities. The state has 9 legislators, of which 1 belongs to the opposition (UNT) and 8 to the government (PSUV and UVE).

=== Trujillo Police ===
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.
==Demographics==

The main cities in the state of Trujillo are: Valera, a city that is the economic capital of the state, and at the same time, the city with the largest population (165,848 inhabitants in 2015 and about 200,000 with the conglomerate Valera-Carvajal). Another important city is Boconó, which is one of the cities with the largest population of the state (127,420 inhabitants), this is an agro-industrial city. Trujillo is the political-administrative capital of the state, with some growth in tourism and other economies. Other important towns are: La Puerta, Pampán, a town of historical importance, Pampanito, Cuicas, Santa Ana de Trujillo, Carache, a great producer of papelón, Betijoque, Escuque, Motatán and others, towns of great regional culture, among others. Its main and only port is La Ceiba located on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

==Economy==

The state bases its economic activity mainly on agriculture, which is complemented by other important sectors.

*Breeding: Poultry, Aquaculture, Bovine, Sheep and Pigs.
*Fishing: Dogfish, Smooth, Skate, Bass and Crab.
*Agricultural Products: Coffee, Cambur, Sugar Cane, Corn, Potato, Banana, Beet, Yucca and Mushroom, of which 40,000 kg are currently produced in Boconó. It should also be noted that in the agricultural area there is a growing development that is supported by more than ten (10) Fish Production Units, which maintain considerable levels of production of Trout in the Municipality of Boconó (50. 000 kg/year); Tilapias in the El Jaguito sector of the Andrés Bello Municipality (100,000 kg/year) and the Artificial Reproduction Plant located in El Corazón Moor, &quot;El Riecito&quot; sector (Municipality of Trujllo), whose production of trout fry is close to 300,000 units/year.
*Forest Resources: Carob tree, Apamate, Gateado, Jabillo, Jobo, Roble, Vera, among others.
*Mineral Resources: Despite the discovery of oil in Lake Maracaibo at the beginning of the 20th century, oil activity in Tomoporo only began timidly in the 1980s, when the TOM-1 well was drilled in 1986. With the drilling of the TOM-7 well in 1999 by EXXON Mobil, which produced 16,000 barrels per day, a giant field was discovered, which is now 25 wells in 2009. Among other mineral resources being exploited in the state are Silica Sands, Limestone, Feldspar, Granite, and Mica.
=== Agriculture ===
The great variety of geological, geomorphological and climatic factors have determined the existence of a great variety of soils in the state, which has a total of 291,280 ha of agricultural land, representing 39.36% of its total area. In addition some 55,110 ha of livestock use (7.45%), some 307,020 ha of forest vegetation (41.49%) and 86,590 ha of combined use (11.70%). In the plain in contact with Lake Maracaibo or &quot;low zone&quot;, specifically in
jurisdiction of the municipalities of Andrés Bello, La Ceiba, Sucre, Bolívar and Monte Carmelo, and in the plains of Monay (municipality of Pampán), the highest proportion It comprises about 200,000 ha of land suitable for agricultural and forestry use for the cultivation of cereals,oilseeds,roots and tubers,vegetables and plantations and/or fruit trees.

One of the oldest irrigation systems and agricultural settlements in the country, El Cenizo, was built in this area and development programmes have been undertaken It is also located on the plain in the industrial zone of Agua Santa, of the same name as the Caús-Pocó, with fruit trees, cereals and an important Cattle farm. In the plains of Monay, located in the north and east of the AguaViva, sugar cane production has a great competitive advantage due to its proximity to the La Pastora power station and the agronomic conditions of its soils.

=== National Parks ===

*The General Cruz Carrillo National Park (Guaramacal Park) is an interesting ecosystem located in the mountains of Guaramacal, formed by cloud forests and moors with little intervention. It was created according to Decree No. 2,170 of May 25, 1988, to protect it both for its environmental interest and to ensure the production of water for the supply of the surrounding population centers and for the Boconó-Tucupido hydroelectric development. It is located in the jurisdiction of the states of Trujillo and Portuguesa; it has an extension of 210 km2, of which 193.11 km2 are included in the state of Trujillo.

*Dinira National Park was created according to Decree No. 2564 dated November 30, 1988, to protect the upper basins of theTocuyo River, in the state of Lara; the Chabasquén and Boconó Rivers, in the state of Portuguesa; and the Carache River, in the state of Trujillo, and to guarantee the water resources necessary for human supply, agricultural development and biological diversity. It is located towards the northeast of the state, on the border with the states of Lara and Portuguesa, with whom It has an area of 453.28 km2, of which only 97.41 km2 correspond to the state of Trujillo.

The structures of the church are modern, it is also of great height. In the main tower there is a clock and a bell tower. The Clock of the San Alejo Church tower was donated by one of the wealthiest characters of the time, Don Perpetuo Clavo, who had it brought from Switzerland. Like several of the churches in the villages of Trujillo, the tower clock works perfectly and the bells announce the passing of time.

<text>A câmara municipal (, meaning literally municipal chamber and often referred as câmara de vereadores or simply as câmara) is a type of municipal governing body, existing in several countries of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. 

In Portugal, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Timor-Leste, a &quot;câmara municipal&quot; is the executive body of a municipality. In Brazil, it is the legislature of a municipality. São Tome and Príncipe has similar &quot;câmaras distritais&quot; (district chambers), which are the executive bodies of the districts (municipalities).

In all these countries, the members of a &quot;câmara&quot; are known as &quot;vereadores&quot; (aldermen).

== Brazil ==

The Brazilian &quot;câmaras municipais&quot; or &quot;câmaras de vereadores&quot; have their origin in the municipal administration model inherited from Portugal. However, while the Portuguese &quot;câmaras&quot; evolved towards becoming executive bodies, in Brazil they evolved towards becoming the legislative bodies of the municipalities, especially after the creation of the &quot;prefeituras municipais&quot; (municipal prefectures) in the 1930s. In Brazil, the executive municipal power is now vested in the &quot;prefeituras municipais&quot;, each headed by the &quot;prefeito&quot; (mayor). 

Each &quot;câmara&quot; is composed of a number of elected &quot;vereadores&quot;.

== Portugal ==

Its members (&quot;vereadores&quot;, aldermen) are elected by the Hondt method, serve year-round and are paid. The president of a Municipal Chamber is the head of the most-voted list. The &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot; has an odd number of aldermen (from five to thirteen), determined by the number of registered voters within the municipality, with the exceptions of Lisbon (fixed at 17 aldermen) and Porto (15 aldermen).

The term can also refer to the building where the Municipal Chamber offices are located, i.e., the City Hall, although it is more properly termed &quot;Paços do Concelho&quot; (literally, the &quot;Palace of the Concelho&quot;).

A Câmara municipal is an executive body of a municipal, a level higher than the Junta de freguesia.
The legislature equivalent of Câmara municipal is the Assembleia Municipal.

<text>La Guaira State (), known until 2019 as Vargas State (, ), is one of the 23 states of Venezuela.

Formerly named after Venezuela&#x27;s first civilian president, José María Vargas, the state comprises a coastal region in the north of Venezuela, bordering Aragua to the west, Miranda to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Capital District to the south. It is home to both the country&#x27;s largest seaport and airport. The state capital and largest city is La Guaira followed by Catia La Mar and Maiquetía. The Litoral Varguense conurbation is the principal urban agglomeration in the state, which is part of the Greater Caracas Area.

In 1999, the geographic center of the state suffered major floods and landslides, known as (the Vargas tragedy), causing major losses of life and property, and resulting in forced population movements, including the virtual disappearance of some small towns. Thousands died, and many more fled the area to other states. The state&#x27;s name was changed on 14 June 2019 to La Guaira.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
It was the Arauaco Indians who first inhabited the central coast and then the western part of Venezuela. However, 500 years before the arrival of Christopher Columbus, they were displaced, in some places by the Caribs, settled on these coasts. The state of La Guaira later became the great Tarma nation, extended between Puerto Maya and the Valles del Tuy, populated by Indians, who spoke the Caribbean language.

=== Spanish colonization ===
A mestizo Guaiquerí, Francisco Fajardo, arrived in 1555 and founded La Villa del Rosario. The outrages committed against the aborigines by the Spaniards who accompanied him made his attempt at peaceful conquest fail. As a consequence of this, the aboriginal congress held in the Uveros de Macuto and called by the chief Guaicamacuto, sought to expel Francisco Fajardo from the occupied territory, showing signs of primitive sessions of republican democracy.
=== Territorial history ===
This political-territorial region has suffered important changes over the years, its territory (Aguado and Vargas) was part of the province of Caracas, during the whole colonial period.

According to the decree of March 9, 1864, by Marshal Juan Crisóstomo Falcón, the organization of the Federal District is established in the following terms: &quot;Article 2.- The Federal District, whose capital is Caracas, is made up of the former cantons of Caracas, La Guaira and Maiquetía, which will form Departments under the names of &quot;El Libertador&quot;, &quot;Vargas&quot; and &quot;Aguado&quot;, with Caracas, La Guaira and Maiquetía as their respective capitals. Their limits, those indicated by the law of April 28, 1856, on territorial division&quot;. In 1868, Vargas became part, together with the Libertador Department, of the State of Bolivar (current territory of the State of Miranda, Capital District and State of La Guaira together).
In 1879, through the agreement of April 30, the twenty states of the Union (of the United States of Venezuela) were reduced to seven large states, the reduction being governed by the Law of April 28, 1856, which established the last sectional demarcation, by which the State of the Center is created, composed of Bolivar, Guzmán Blanco, Guárico, Apure and Nueva Esparta, becoming, on April 27, 1881, the &quot;State Guzmán Blanco&quot; composed only of Bolivar, Aragua, Guárico, Nueva Esparta and the department Vargas of the Federal District.
In 1889, a year after Antonio Guzmán Blanco left power definitively, it was decided in a new territorial reorganization, to rename the Guzmán Blanco State with the name of &quot;Estado Miranda&quot;, excluding from this new arrangement what was the province of Aragua.

In 1909 both Vargas and Aguado were incorporated into Federal District. In 1936 Aguado and Vargas merged into one Department: Vargas.
Until 1987, it kept the name and conditions of Department, when by decree of 1986 it became Municipality Vargas.

In the decade of the 90s of the 20th century, the autonomist demands that desired the state of La Guaira as a territory differentiated from the Federal District politically and economically increased. In 1998, the government of Rafael Caldera decreed the municipality of Vargas as autonomous, separate from the Federal District, with the status of Federal Territory, and shortly thereafter it definitively became the 23rd state in the nation.
The creation of the state of La Guaira has motivated the appearance of new autonomist movements in other regions of the country, as in the case of the municipality Páez in the state of Apure, which has more geographical aspects similar to Táchira than to the rest of Apure. In the past, the state of La Guaira has sought to have the jurisdiction of the Archipelago of Los Roques totally transferred to the state. There are also proposals to subdivide the state into 2 or 3 municipalities, which currently only has a single municipal entity.

=== Recent history ===
This region of Venezuela has undergone important changes over the years, and while the geographical borders have remained, the territorial delineation has varied. The area was previously one of the departments of the Venezuela&#x27;s Federal District (the other being the Libertador department, now Libertador Municipality), and the governor of this region was chosen by the national government. The area later evolved into a municipality, but was still dependent on the governor of the Federal District. In the 1990s there were increased calls for Vargas to become a separate entity, distinct from Federal District. In 1998 the government of Rafael Caldera decreed Vargas as an independent municipality, separate from the Federal District, with the statute of Federal Territory. Shortly after it became the 23rd state of Venezuela.

In mid-December 1999, after several days of ever-increasing rains pouring over the Cordillera de la Costa Central and the piedmont within the span of 24 hours along the coastline for about ., the state suffered from massive floods which resulted in severe losses of life and property. In its wake as of December 16, the surviving population witnessed the massive destruction of most of the state infrastructure, including the collapse of most roads, bridges, housings, public and private buildings, and of basic services as electricity and communications; in which thousands were killed or missing. Official estimates some 50,000 dead or missing, but the real figure may be much higher. In the following weeks nearly the entire state&#x27;s population was displaced. Locals refer to the Dec. 1999 disaster as &quot;La Tragedia de Vargas&quot; (the Vargas&#x27; Tragedy). Such climatic phenomenon (of extraordinarily high rainfall levels) appears to be periodical, having a cycle of about 70 years, and probably has occurred hundreds, perhaps thousands of times since a distant past.

== Geography ==

The state of La Guaira is located in the coastal-mountain region, north of the state of Miranda and the capital district. Previously, La Guaira belonged to the federal district, but since 1998, this municipality has been elevated to a state.

This state has only one municipality, the municipality of Vargas, which is divided into eleven parishes. The state government and the municipality&#x27;s mayor&#x27;s office are in the same jurisdiction.

The space comprised by the Vargas state is generally elongated, presenting its maximum amplitude in the extreme west towards Carayaca, to then reduce considerably in the center, around the urban centers of Maiquetía and Macuto. From La Guaira it begins to expand again in an almost symmetrical way up to its eastern limit. The state has an area of 1,497 square kilometers (0.13% of the national territory); in fact, it is the second state with the smallest territorial area in the country and represents 12.28% of the capital region. The entity has the following limits: to the north with the Caribbean Sea, to the south with the state of Miranda in the extreme southeast, the Capital District in the central sector and the state of Aragua in the extreme southwest; to the east with the state
Miranda (the Chuspa River is the natural border), and to the west with the state of Aragua
(Moralera Creek and the Maya River define the boundary with this state).

=== Climate ===

The climate of the state is a factor that generates strong territorial contrasts, since it varies according to the altitudinal levels. In general, the climate is arid tropical, in the high zones of Galipán, Carayaca and El Junko it is temperate tropical due to the altitude, the humid tropical climate with little rain is characterized in the rest of the territory. In the areas below 400 m.a.s.l., high temperatures predominate presenting an average of 26.1°C with infrequent rainfall. From this level, temperatures are more moderate, with an annual average of 14.7°C and more frequent and intense rainfall. The average annual temperature of La Guaira is 28°C, with scarce daily and annual thermal amplitudes.23

Thus, for the different altitudes in the region, the following characteristics are found for the different altitudinal floors, such as

1.Tropical: It presents an altitude that varies between 0 and 600 m.a.s.l. with an annual average temperature of 25.4 and 26.1°C. In these climates they have registered average values of precipitation in the following spaces:

* Puerto Maya - Arrecife (600mm/year).
* Mamo (325mm/year).
* Maiquetía - Anare (600–800mm/year).
* Los Caracas - La Sabana (1100 – 1500mm/year).
* Caruao - Chuspa (1800mm/year).
2. Low Pre-Mountain and High Pre-Mountain: It presents an altitude that varies between 600 and 1600 m.a.s.l. with an annual average temperature of 18 and 24°C. In these climates they have registered average values of precipitation in:

* Carayaca - Petaquire (850 – 900mm/year)
3. Low Mountain: It presents an altitude that varies between 1600 and 2400 m.s.n.m.

==== Precipitation ====
From the data of monthly average precipitation for a group of representative meteorological stations of the Vargas state, there is a predominance of wet months almost all year round, except for December to March. The seasons with the highest average monthly rainfall records are Caruao and El Portachuelo, where the wet weight is equal to or greater than 10 months. In the coastal plain and foothills, average monthly rainfall records are low throughout the year, with the Mamo season recording the driest period from January to March.

==== Temperatures ====
The analysis of the geographical distribution of the annual average temperature is carried out based on the stations with available records, being these the ones located in the coastal area. For the mountainous zone, we adapted the equation of correlation between the average temperature of an area in degrees Celsius and the height above sea level.
of the sea, according to the equation: Average 27.6°C (average level 0.6) / 100.

From the recorded and estimated values, three clearly defined zones are interpreted: a coastal zone with high annual average temperatures, which range from 25.4°C to 26.1°C. An intermediate mountainous zone (from 972 meters above sea level to 1300 meters above sea level), which presents temperatures ranging from 18.4°C to 21.2°C; and another higher mountainous zone with heights between 1787 meters above sea level and 2101 meters above sea level, where relatively low temperatures of 13.9°C are registered in Alto de Ño León and 15.8°C in the next high station of Colonia Tovar, located in the state of Aragua.

=== Relief ===
The state consists almost entirely of coastlines as it faces the Caribbean Sea, but in the south of the state, is the Avila hill, icon of the state and Caracas, of the Cordillera de la Costa with peaks that exceed 2,000 m as Naiguatá Peak (2,765 m asl). It is home to Galipán, the highest population in La Guaira State, (partly because there is another part of Caracas and another part of Miranda State).

=== Geology ===
It corresponds to the one developed in the Coastal Range. It has as a geological limit the La Victoria Fault, where the rocks of the Gran Caracas group outcrop, on the igneous-metamorphic basement of the Sebastopol Complex of the lower Paleozoic, which is constituted by gneissic granite and chlorite schist. The formations are also located: Peña de Mora belonging to the Mesozoic, the Todasana Magmatic Complex of the upper Cretaceous, the Las Pailas formation of the late Pliocene, and the Abyssinian formation, composed of marine sediments.

=== Hydrography ===
The state is a kind of terminal for the rivers of Caracas and other populations because several rivers in the state flow into the Caribbean Sea, almost all of them are ravines of the Avila Hill.

Some rivers in the state of La Guaira are:

* Limón.
* Caruao.
* Chuspa.
* Naiguatá.
* La Vega.
* Tacagua
* Mamo
* Pantano
In the state there are streams with the same name of some rivers in the area for simply being in the middle of the route of these water bodies.

=== Soils ===
Considering as unit of analysis the mountainous system of the Coast, of which the Vargas state is part, the predominant type of soil in this unit is the Haplustults, whose main characteristics are: moderately deep (from 75cm to 100cm), of medium to fine textures, increasing its clay content with depth. It is moderately stony, with medium to high contents of organic matter in the surface horizons. Drainage varies from well to excessively drained.

Based on the soil-forming factors and the predominant type of reference soil (Haplustults), in the entity the Haplargids and Torriorthents soil types were identified in the areas near the coast, where the humidity conditions are critical.
In areas with higher slopes, Udorthents soils are classified, and in areas with lower slopes, the Paleustults. In areas with lower temperatures, typical of the mountain landscape, evolved and deep soils are identified as the Haplohumuslts. In areas of higher humidity, such as those at the extremes of the state, Hapludults soils are classified.

=== Vegetation ===

Adopting Otto Huber&#x27;s classification of plant formations, the plant landscape varguense is quite contrasted, being identified from the altitudinal base to 100 meters above sea level coastal vegetation of the halophilic and psamophilic herbaceous type, and bushes
coastal xerophiles. Next, and according to the altitudinal succession, we observe
thorny xerophytic shrubs (cardinal and spiny) of very variable density and
low altitude (2–5 m); it is followed by the troopophilic basimontane forest, deciduous, transitional vegetation of the lowland species by the mountain species. Then, in the submontane belt extends the ombrophile forest, seasonal semideciduous (trade winds forests).
It is followed by a well-developed strip of submontane to evergreen mountain forests, called coastal cloud forests, dense forests with several medium to high tree strata. Finally, at the upper limit of the forest, from 2,200 meters above sea level, the areas of coastal shrubby moors are identified.

=== Biodiversity ===
The biodiversity of the state of Vargas is as rich and varied as its natural spaces.
In the southwestern section of the state, in the mountainous zone of the cloud forest, there is a great variety of tree species, among the most exuberant are trees such as granadillo (Prumnopitys harmsiana), Sapium sp. and cedar (Cedrela montana). Of this last species is a specimen called &quot;the giant cedar&quot;, which has a height of 47 meters and a diameter of 22 meters, located in the
La Florida peak (2,240 meters above sea level). Another impressive tree in the area is the niño (Gyranthera caribensis), endemic to the Coastal Range. There are numerous species of guamos (Inga sp.), Protium sp., Alchornea triplinervia and Micropholis crotonoides, and palms such as the striking prapa (Wettinia praemorsa). In the hillside areas you can observe the majestic royal palms (Ceroxylon interruptum), palmetto (Euterpe predatoria), molinillo (Chamaedorea pinnatifrons) and araque (Dictyocaryum fuscum). Others Important species are the orchids, especially the Christmas orchid (Masdevallia tovarensis), an endemic species of the natural monument Agustin Codazzi.
== Government and politics ==

Like other states, the structure of the government of Vargas is laid out in the Constitution, the highest law in the state.

It is an autonomous state and politically equal to the rest of the Venezuelan federation, it organizes its administration and public powers through the constitution of the State of La Guaira, dictated by the Legislative Council, and which was sanctioned on August 23, 2001, entering into force on August 30, 2001, when it was published in the Official State Gazette.

=== Executive Power ===
It is composed of the governor and a group of state secretaries appointed by him to assist him in the management of the government. The governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate reelection for equal periods, being in charge of the state administration.

Since the elevation to the category of federal state, the state has chosen its governors in direct elections, before 1998 its governor was the same of the disappeared Federal District.

The current state government has been headed since 2021 by José Manuel Suárez.

=== Legislative Power ===
The state legislature falls to the Legislative Council of the State of La Guaira, a unicameral parliament, elected by the people through direct and secret vote every four years, and they can be reelected for consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the state and its municipalities. Since the last elections, the state has had 7 deputies, of which 1 belongs to the opposition and 6 to the government.

=== Vargas Police ===
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

== Demographics ==
=== Race and ethnicity ===
According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

== Tourism ==

The tourist resource in the state is conformed by significant natural attractions, which contain a singular beauty contributed by the contrast that exists between the sea and the mountains. It is attractive to appreciate from the coast how an imposing mountainous relief that houses innumerable natural riches, giving it a
less harsh to the dry but attractive coastal environment. In the entity there is a great number of natural beaches and spas, predominantly those of natural origin. The latter are less visited due to their remoteness and difficult accessibility from Caracas,
except the natural beaches near Punta Gorda,Tanaguarena, Camurí Grande and Los Caracas.

On the other hand, the resorts are located in more accessible places, providing the public with some service infrastructure. Among the most popular are Playa Grande (Catia La Mar), Macuto, Camurí Chico, Playa Los Ángeles and Naiguatá.

In addition to beach areas, there are other natural options with potential for
to carry out ecotourism activities, close to the beaches and associated with the enjoyment of rivers and
surrounding mountains to the coast. Among the most prominent are mentioned, in the sense
East-West: Chuspa, Caruao, La Sabana, Urama, Todasana, Oritapo, Osma, Los Caracas, Anare, Puerto Carayaca, Uricao, Chichiriviche, Puerto Cruz and Puerto Maya.

Many of the resources available in the state are being used by the
intensive recreation and tourism in both the mountain and coastal areas; it is
mention: Oricao Club Campestre, Club Tanaguarena, Club Camurí Grande, Club
Puerto Azul, Ciudad Vacacional Los Caracas, Altos de Lagunazo, areas adjacent to the Humboldt Hotel and Caraballeda golf courses. In the agricultural area of Galipán, several restaurants and rural recreation sites have been implemented, of which the Museo de Piedra Marina Soñadora, one of the most visited in the area, stands out.
There is also a recreational park in the state of Vargas bordering the town of El Junquito, located in the municipality of Libertador, equipped with services for intensive enjoyment of the open field; the Metropolitan Recreational Park El Junquito was created according to presidential decree No. 913 published in the Official Gazette No. 30,693 on 18
May 1975.

== Culture ==
=== Cultural Heritage ===
Within the state exists &quot;The Individual Creation&quot;, a series of autonomous manifestations within the region and they are constituted in definitive as people of cultural relevance, for what their inhabitants devote themselves to the literature, to the interpretative creations, call the singer-songwriter, musicians and dances, many of the collections, the patrimonial carriers and to the artistic creations; among those that stand out inside a great range:

=== Celebrations ===
==== Descent of the Magi ====
Every January 6, after the children make a written request for a toy from the Three Kings, leaving the requested gift on their shoes. This tradition keeps alive the childish illusion, something lost in our times.

==== Virgin of Candelaria ====
Every year, on February 2, the Patron Saint&#x27;s Day of the Virgin of Candelaria in its context is made up of the popular religious behavior of the social collectivities. The dance groups, costumes, masks and bands of musicians lead to expressions of overflowing festive sensibility. Finally, the Candlemas Festival has been gaining national space, recreating the Puno patron saint festival in Arequipa, Lima, places where the residents of the Altiplano express their cultural identity. People can go sightseeing in the areas.

==== The Burial of the Sardine ====
It is celebrated on Ash Wednesday, after Carnival, and is charged with irreverence, ambiguous characters with inverted roles and expressions of relaxation. In the beginning it was associated with the custom of burying a pig&#x27;s rib called sardine, symbolizing the prohibition of eating meat during the days of Lent.

There are those who believe that the burial of the sardine was a way of attracting abundant fishing and fertility of the animals before a new cycle of reproduction, but it is also considered a typical festival of carnivals because it is a time when it is normally allowed to do everything that is prohibited and the manifestation also acquires these characteristics. It is in itself a parody, simulating the passage of a burial in the streets of the town.

==== Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day ====
Like so many other traditions in the state, the feast of St. Joseph is celebrated on March 19.

==== Dancing Devils of Naiguatá ====

The dancing devils of Corpus Christi, along with 11 other brotherhoods in the country, entered the representative list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity approved by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris on December 6, 2012.25 This is the legacy of the first inhabitants of Naiguatá, a product of racial and cultural crossbreeding. In this magical-religious celebration of Corpus Christi, the Holy Sacrament of the Altar is worshipped in a festival of marked religious syncretism with the dance of hundreds of Devils dancing all over the town, making their tradition last in time and never to be forgotten. They identify themselves by painting their own costumes, wearing white pants and a white shirt, painted with crosses, stripes and circles, figures that prevent the evil one from dominating them. The masks are mostly marine animals. They wear crossed scapulars, carry holy palm crosses and crucifixes. They do not wear a cape or a mandator.

==== Feast of the Holy Innocents ====
Every December 28, the Catholic Church commemorates the death of the Holy Innocents in honor of the children killed by order of King Herod. In the Middle Ages this rite was linked to another more pagan rite known as the &quot;Feast of the Fools&quot;, celebrated on the days between Christmas and New Year. This fusion of history, religion and paganism has in turn led to a series of celebrations in various regions of the world that include costumes, typical music and the congregation of communities to participate.

==== Feast of St. John the Baptist ====
In Venezuela, it is a tradition in this population that the celebration begins on the eve of the day of San Juan Bautista, that is, on June 23 at night. At the beginning of the afternoon, the drummers begin with the execution of the mine drum and the curbata, located at one side of the square. Already at night, in a nearby house where the small image of San Juan Bautista is found, in its niche well decorated with colored papers, flowers, fabrics and palms, the drummers arrive and begin to &quot;intone&quot; in front of the saint to begin the first wake.

== Sports ==

<doc id="556302" wikidata="Q201121" url="?curid=556302" title="Yaracuy">
<text>Yaracuy (, ;) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. Yaracuy is located in the Central-Western Region, Venezuela. It is bordered by Falcón in the north, in the west by Lara, in the south by Portuguesa and Cojedes and in the east by Cojedes and Carabobo.

The geography of state is mountainous, the Andes range ends there, and the Coastal Range begins. It is split by two mountainous systems, the Sierra de Aroa on the North and the Sierra de Nirgua. In between lies the agricultural land drained by the Yaracuy River. Most cities and towns are in this valley, including the capital city.

The Cerro María Lionza Natural Monument is located in Chivacoa. Yaracuy is known as the Louisiana of Venezuela, due to the practices of witchcraft, occultism and the practice of religions such as voodoo, very similar to Louisiana Voodoo.

The economy of Yaracuy is mostly agricultural. Some manufacturing can be found in Yaritagua area and Chivacoa, usually in agribusiness.

== History ==

The written history of Yaracuy begins in the year 1530, with the passage of the German Nicolás Federman, Lieutenant of Governor Welser of Augsburg. In his travel report through the Belzaresque jurisdiction, he qualifies it as Valle de las Damas.

During the colony, it was integrated into the Province of Caracas. The Constitution of 1811 linked it to Barquisimeto; in the constitution sanctioned on June 23, 1824, it was awarded to the Province of Carabobo; by that of May 29, 1832, it again passed to the Province of Barquisimeto; On March 15, 1855, for the first time it was given its own status as the Province of Yaracuy, made up of the cantons of San Felipe, Yaritagua and Nírgua, with the capital San Felipe; It was the second national entity that was designated with the name of state with the advent of the Federal War and this occurred in 1859, but it was only made official with the triumph of the 1864 revolution.

Until the beginning of the 20th century it was a section of the Great Lara State. In 1909 it acquired the current territorial autonomy.

=== First settlers ===
The tribes of the Jirajaras, the coyones, the guayones, the chipas, the noaras, the ayamanes and the caquetíos, constituted the primitive inhabitants of the area; The jirajaras, the guayones and the caquetíos distinguished themselves from these tribes, due to their expansion and dominance.

With certainty, there is little data about the way of life that the indigenous people who populated the Yaracuy regions led. The information we have is based on the references given by people who passed through those sites during colonization and on the persistent remains at that time.
The Indians who inhabited the lands of the Yaracuy were almost entirely nomads, led a slightly sedentary life and lived in constant confrontation with their neighbors. They essentially relied on hunting and fishing, since they did not apply much to agriculture, something in which the jirajaras differed from the rest of the tribes, as they characterized themselves as great farmers.

These primitive inhabitants dedicated temples and offered sacrifices to the divinity, they also had combat techniques (poisoned arrows) and some ate human flesh. Their villages were sometimes up to half a mile in length, and the tribes were organized into obedient confederations, each with a chief chieftain. The women were slender and beautiful, which is why the valley was called by the Spanish &quot;Valley of the Ladies&quot;.

=== Spanish colonization ===

The territory of the Yaracuy State belonged to the province of Venezuela created in 1527, then to the Province of Caracas and later the Province of Carabobo. By the Law of Territorial Political Division of the Republic of 1824, the lands of the Yaracuy State were included in the Province of Carabobo, to which the cantons of San Felipe, Yaritagua and Nirgua belonged.

=== Republican stage ===
Later in 1832 the Province of Barquisimeto was created to which the cantons of San Felipe and Yaritagua belonged, while that of Carabobo retained its jurisdiction over the canton of Nirgua, the latter being separated from the Yaracuyana community. Then in 1855, under the presidency of José Tadeo Monagas, a new province was created made up of the cantons San Felipe and Yaritagua of the Province of Barquisimeto and Nirgua, of that of Carabobo, with San Felipe as the capital. In this way, the Province of Yaracuy became one of the 21 territorial units that made up the country.

In 1864, under the Federalist Constitution it was renamed Yaracuy State and in subsequent years it was subject to several modifications until 1899, when the 20 federal states were established according to the 1864 constitution, among them Yaracuy, which since then has been maintained as a federal entity.

== Geography ==
Yaracuy State is located in the central-western region of Venezuela (Falcón, Lara, Portuguesa and Yaracuy States), between the coordinates 9º50&#x27; and 10º46&#x27; latitude North, and 68º14&#x27; y 69º14&#x27; of longitude West. It is bordered to the north by the state of Falcon, on a 105 km borderline; to the east by the state of Carabobo, on a 75 km borderline; to the south by the state of Cojedes, on an 80 km borderline; and to the east by the state of Lara, on a 205 km borderline (see map on the political-territorial division of the state of Yaracuy, on the map). Although it cannot be considered as a coastal state, it has contact with the Caribbean Sea through its main river, the Yaracuy, which flows into the Boca de Yaracuy, which represents a high potential for the growth of commercial activity in the area, both inland and abroad. 

Currently, we are managing areas of overlap with the boundaries of two states: Falcón, with which 215,12 km² are under discussion, corresponding to the municipalities of Manuel Monge, Veroes and San Felipe, and with which 93,4 km² are under discussion, corresponding to the municipalities of Peñ and Nirgua, for a total of 308.5 km² in claim, which represents 4.35% of the state&#x27;s surface area. The territory officially covers an area of 7,100 km², with a length of 102 km north–south and 109 km east–west. It covers 0.77% of the country&#x27;s territory and is the sixth smallest entity in Venezuela, in the central-western region, with a 10.6% surface area.

=== Climate ===
Average annual temperatures and rainfall are high with variations depending on the altitude: the climate is temperate at the top of its mountains, the subtropical climate in the high valleys of the Sierra de Nirgua; and in most of the state the tropical climate prevails, with average annual temperatures of 22°C and annual rainfall of 1900 mm.

In the valleys of Aroa and Yaracuy, the average temperature is 26 °C and rainfall exceeds 1000 mm per year. Humidity conditions are optimal for cocoa cultivation in the northern sector; in San Felipe 1374 mm of rain is registered, descending to 1332 mm in Chivacoa and 1098 mm in Urachiche. In the highlands of the Sierra de Aroa and part of the Nirgua massif, rainfall is recorded during most of the year, exceeding 1400 mm per year, thus enabling the formation of its most representative vegetation, the evergreen forest.

=== Hydrography ===

The most important rivers belong to the Caribbean basin and are the Yaracuy and Aroa, both of which are over 130 km long. The Yaracuy River crosses Yaracuy and Carabobo, where it forms the Urachiche Gorge, and has the characteristics of a plain river. In the rainy season, its waters tend to go out of the way producing floods. It receives numerous fluvial currents, like Quebrada Grande, Guama, Yurubí, Agua Blanca and Taría, among others.

The Aroa River has its source at 1200 m altitude, on the northern slope of Palo Negro Hill, north of the entity. Its basin covers an area of 2402 km², located between the basins of the Tocuyo River, to the north and west, and the Yaracuy River, to the south and east. Important tributaries are the Yumare, Tupe, Zamuro, Guarataro and Tesorero rivers, as well as the Guacamaya, Carapita, Guaicayare and Galapago streams. It flows through the Golfo Triste into the Caribbean Sea, after a journey of approximately 150 km. Other rivers such as the Turbio and Buria are shorter and flow into the Orinoco basin through the Portuguesa and Cojedes Rivers, respectively. The Cabuy, San Pablo, Yurubí, Guama, Tamboral, Yumare and Crucito Rivers are also located here.

In general, the rivers of the Yaracuy state are characterized by being irregular, that is, the rest of the rivers, outside of the main ones, do not maintain their fixed flow throughout the year; This fact is not due to evaporation, nor to deforestation at the headwaters of the rivers, nor to the rainy regime of the area. The cause of this irregularity is the
nature and sandy constitution of the basin where the rivers flow.

Yaracuy offers throughout its geography a number of rivers such as: the Yaracuy, Yurubí, Aroa, Guama, Los Ureros, Carabobo, etc., and three reservoirs, Cumaripa, Guaremal and Cabuy. The rivers of the Yaracuy State are part of the Caribbean slope and the Atlantic slope. The Yaracuy and Aroa river basins correspond to the side of the Caribbean Sea, and the Cabuy, Turbio, Buria, and Nirgua rivers fall into the Atlantic basins, which form the hydrographic system of the Cojedes and San Carlos rivers.

Water plays a preponderant role in the development of agricultural and industrial activity. In this sense, the Yaracuy state does not present restrictions, given the abundance of water resources it possesses, due to the magnitude of the rainfall that in its territory determines high annual runoff yields in its different hydrographic basins.

Regarding groundwater, the entity has a high potential, which represents positive perspectives for the development of agriculture under irrigation.

=== Geology ===
65% of the territory of the Yaracuy state is made up of mountainous formations and foothills of hills, which in their distribution allow to differentiate three large spaces, these are: the Bobare Coordillera, which separates the Yaracuy state from the Falcón state; the Sierra de Aroa, separated from the Bobare Coordillera by the Aroa River Valley, and the Macizo de Nirgua, separated from the Sierra de Aroa by the Turbio-Yaracuy Depression, giving rise to an alternation of mountains, flat lands, valleys and depressions.
=== Relief ===

The Yaracuy state relief is extremely diverse, presenting an alternation of valleys, plains, depressions, foothills and mountains (65% of the territory). It corresponds to the sector where the Coordillera de los Andes ends, and the Coordillera de la Costa begins, a sector that is occupied by three well-differentiated formations, the Macizo de Nirgua, the Sierra de Aroa and that of Bobare, the three separated from each other by the Yaracuy Turbio depression and the Aroa River Valley.

The Nirgua Massif formed by a group of foothills that are linked to the coastal range, has its culminating point at Cerro la Copa (1810 m). The Sierra de Aroa, located in the central part and oriented in a southwest–northeast direction, divides the two main depressions and has its highest point at Cerro el Tigre (1780 m). The Sierra de Bobare separates Yaracuy from Falcón.

=== Soils ===
In the northern part of Yaracuy State, sand and silt (mud) can be found mostly, while other sectors present a frank-clayey character. The state has significant mineral resource potential, especially in the non-metallic category, among which are sand and gravel, red clay, limestone, talc, marble, feldspathic sands, peat, feldspars, and gypsum.

=== Fauna and Flora ===
The more representative vegetation of the forest entities is that, despite the interventions to which they have been subjected, it proliferates both in the valleys of the Aroaya-Yaracuyuy rivers and in the Nirgua field. At an altitude of 800msnms, a dense cloud forest develops, while on the banks of the Yar River, the forest prevails. The rest of the state space is covered by bushes, savannah vegetation, pastures and cultivated areas, fundamentally due to the greater human intervention.

==== Flora ====
The flora of the state of Yaracuy is very varied, and has been the subject of numerous studies. Some regions of the state were visited by the Swiss naturalist Henri Pittier in the 1820s, who left detailed records of his findings in numerous publications and deposited the first botanical samples in the herbarium of the Museo Comercial e Industrial de Venezuela, which later became part of the National Herbarium of Venezuela. However, botanical activity in subsequent years has been irregular and some groups of plants are still considered underrepresented in national herbariums. Recently, several specific inventories of floristic elements from the natural and cultivated regions of the state have been made.

==== Vertebrates ====

At least 40 species of land mammals and 51 species of bats have been recorded in the Sierra de Aroa, and at least one species of shrew and tree frog endemic to this locality has been described.

==== Invertebrates ====

Exhaustive inventories of the insects of the state of Yaracuy have not been published, but there are some specific studies of the diurnal butterflies and coprophagous beetles in an agricultural-forest mosaic of the foothills of Zapatero Hill in the Guáquira hacienda.

Among the butterflies, some 129 species were registered, predominantly from the family Nymphalidae, but it is estimated that there are more than 240 species. At least 22 species of beetles were also found, including a species endemic to Venezuela, Bdelyropsis venezuelensis Howden, 1976.

==Government and politics==

Like other states, the structure of the government of Yaracuy is laid out in the Constitution, the highest law in the state. 
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

=== Executive power ===
It is made up of the Yaracuy State Governor and a group of State Secretaries appointed by him who assist him in government functions. The Governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate reelection for equal periods, being in charge of the state administration.

Since 1989, governors have been chosen in direct elections by the population, the current government is headed by Julio César León Heredia, who has been in power since 2008.

=== Legislative power ===
The state legislature rests on the Yaracuy State Legislative Council, a unicameral parliament, elected by the people by direct and secret vote every four years, being able to be re-elected for additional consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the state population and its municipalities, the State has 9 deputies. The regional parliament approves the local budget and state laws.
== Municipalities and municipal seats ==

Yaracuy is divided into fourteen municipalities:

The state capital is San Felipe de Yaracuy. Other important towns are Aroa, Chivacoa, Cocorote, Marín, Nirgua, Sabana de Parra, Yaritagua, and Urachiche.

Yaracuy State covers a total surface area of . Population: 597,700 inhabitants (2007 est).

== Demographics ==
=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

== Culture ==
The state of Yaracuy is represented by a rich social and cultural variety. It maintains ancestral roots since the Yaracuyan is, particularly, &quot;lover of his land&quot;. Nevertheless, the customs give place, at the same time, to the modern lines of expression.

The Procers: The fact that each Educational Institution bears the name of some Procer (local or national), and whose biography becomes part of the preparation of the students, is striking. Schools and colleges celebrate the dates inherent to the character to whom the educational and formative path is dedicated.

Religious Diversity: As in all Venezuela, Yaracuy also celebrates with great effort the Catholic festivities: Holy Week (with the usual processions), The Burning of Judas, The Birth of the Child Jesus (Nativity of the Lord), among others. However, there is also room and relevance for celebrations based on other religious samples, own and/or imported from the colonial era, such as: The Carnival, Dances on Embers, among others.

They are part of the cultural heritage of Yaracuy, an endless number of legends and myths, own in some cases, adaptations in another; that even enjoy representations in different festivals and events.

Other dances, Creole dances and rondas are: El Sebucán, Mare Mare and El Pájaro Guarandol.

<text>EE Times (Electronic Engineering Times) is an electronics industry magazine published in the United States since 1972. EE Times is currently owned by AspenCore, a division of Arrow Electronics since August 2016.

Since its acquisition by AspenCore, EE Times has seen major editorial and publishing technology investment and a renewed emphasis on investigative coverage. New features include The Dispatch, which profiles frontline engineers and unpacks real-life design problems and their solutions in technical yet conversational reporting.

==Ownership and status==
&quot;EE Times&quot; was launched in 1972 by Gerard G. Leeds of CMP Publications Inc. In 1999, the Leeds family sold CMP to United Business Media for $900 million. After 2000, &quot;EE Times&quot; moved more into web publishing. The shift in advertising from print to online began to accelerate in 2007, and the periodical shed staff to adjust to the downturn in revenue.

In July 2013, the digital edition migrated to UBM TechWeb&#x27;s DeusM community platform.

On June 3, 2016, UBM announced that &quot;EE Times&quot;, along with the rest of its electronics media portfolio (EDN, Embedded.com, TechOnline, and Datasheets.com), was being sold to AspenCore Media, a company owned by Arrow Electronics, for $23.5 million. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2016.

==Availability==
&quot;EE Times&quot; is free for qualified design engineers, managers, and business and corporate management in the electronics industry. It is also available online; the &quot;EE Times&quot; website offers news, columns, and features articles for semiconductor manufacturing, communications, electronic design automation, electronic engineering, technology, and products. In November 2012, UBM Electronics announced that the December 2012 issue of &quot;EE Times&quot; would be the last in print. In 2013, &quot;EE Times&quot; will be an online product only.

In 2018, EE Times rolled out a refreshed website, resurrected its print edition in Europe, and launched a new radio show, EE Times On Air, available an hour after the live broadcast as a podcast.

<text>Konx Om Pax: Essays in Light is a publication by British occultist Aleister Crowley, first published in 1907.

The title, &quot;Konx Om Pax&quot;, is a phrase said to have been pronounced in the Eleusinian Mysteries to bid initiates to depart after having completed the tests for admission to the degree of &quot;epopt&quot; (seer). The origin and meaning of this phrase are obscure, although numerous theories have been proposed. Feidias Mpourlas claimed that the phrase is derived from a misunderstanding of onomatopoeic words in the entry &quot;κογξ ομοίως παξ&quot; of Hesychius&#x27; dictionary, where &quot;ομοίως&quot; might have been abbreviated to &quot;ομ.&quot;. S. L. MacGregor Mathers claimed the phrase was derived from &quot;Khabs-am Pekht&quot;, which in the Egyptian language means roughly &quot;light in extension&quot; or &quot;light rushing out in a single ray&quot;, which is used in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn&#x27;s Vernal and Autumnal Equinox ceremonies. This is the meaning which Crowley ascribes to the phrase within the book.

The front cover image, portraying the title &quot;Konx Om Pax&quot; in stretched letters, is said to have been designed by Crowley while smoking hashish.

== Contents ==

=== Introduction ===

Syncretic materials introduce the work:

* Ave: in John Dee and Edward Kelley&#x27;s Enochian language;
* the Egyptian hieroglyphs for the Stele of Ankh-f-n-khonsu

Three full pages of quotations introduce this work, signaling the syncretic intention of the author. Many sacred texts and sources such as Dante, Catullus, and Jesus are quoted.

=== The Wake World ===
An allegory for the ascent of a magical practitioner through the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, guided by their Holy Guardian Angel (the &quot;Fairy Prince&quot;). After the fashion of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, Crowley uses the narrative as an explanatory jaunt through this metaphysical schema. It was originally written for Crowley&#x27;s daughter, Lola Zaza, as a bedtime story.

=== Thien Tao, or, the Synagogue of Satan ===

This parodic essay casts a Crowley character (Master Kwaw) as a Taoist advisor to the Japanese &quot;Daimio&quot; (&quot;daimyō&quot;) in a time of crisis. Kwaw advises a course of study in which people shall be taught the antithesis of their natural tendencies: the prostitute to learn chastity, the prude to learn sexual expression, the religious bigot to learn Huxley&#x27;s materialism, the atheist to learn ceremonial magick.

=== Ali Sloper, or, the Forty Liars: A Christmas Diversion ===
A play that is over-presented with title credits, but is generally a simple dialogue based on Crowley&#x27;s conversation with a friend and his wife on Christmas Day. With only two main speakers Crowley satirizes himself as &quot;Bowley&quot;, with the whole a means to present his inserted essay Ameth. The title is a mock of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, a tale from the classic &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

=== Stone of the Philosophers Which Is Hidden in the Mountain of Abiegnus ===
A satirical conversation between a number of men, including &quot;a socialist&quot; and &quot;a doctor&quot;, each one contributing a poem into their philosophical debate. Here Crowley takes the stance as &quot;Basil Gray&quot;; the work contains &quot;La Gitana&quot;, his popular love poem. It is thought that this work was inspired by the Zohar, where each Rabbi would contribute a commentary on the Tanakh.

<text>An Assembleia Municipal (; &quot;municipal assembly&quot;; plural: &quot;assembleias municipais&quot;) is the legislature that governs a municipality in Portugal. Part of the assembly&#x27;s members are elected every four years among candidate lists by the D&#x27;Hondt method, simultaneously with the election of the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;; the remainder member are the presidents of the Junta de freguesia that compose the municipality, whose number cannot exceed the number of elected members. A municipal assembly generally meets five times a year, and its members are paid a presence fee for each meeting.

It is a level higher than the Assembleia de freguesia.
The executive equivalent of the Assembleia Municipal is the Câmara municipal.

<text>Hill Air Force Base is a major U.S. Air Force (USAF) base located in Davis County, Utah, just south of the city of Ogden, and bordering the Cities of Layton, Clearfield, Riverdale, Roy, and Sunset with its largest border immediately adjacent to Clearfield and Layton. It is about north of Salt Lake City. The base was named in honor of Major Ployer Peter Hill of the U.S. Army Air Corps, who died in 1935 test-flying &quot;NX13372&quot;, the original Model 299 prototype of the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. As of 2018, Hill AFB is the sixth-largest employer in the state of Utah.
Hill AFB is the home of the Air Force Materiel Command&#x27;s (AFMC) Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC) which is the worldwide manager for a wide range of aircraft, engines, missiles, software, avionics, and accessories components. The OO-ALC is part of the Air Force Sustainment Center.

The host unit at Hill AFB is the AFMC&#x27;s 75th Air Base Wing (75 ABW), which provides services and support for the OO-ALC and its subordinate organizations. Additional tenant units at Hill AFB include operational fighter wings of Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).

==History==
Hill Air Force Base is named in honor of Major Ployer Peter Hill (1894–1935), the Chief of the Flying Branch of the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) Material Division of Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. Major Hill had died as a result of injuries he received from the crash of the Boeing Aircraft Company&#x27;s experimental aircraft Boeing Model 299 at Wright Field, the prototype airplane for what became the famous B-17 Flying Fortress.

Hill Air Force Base traces its origins back to the ill-fated U.S. Army&#x27;s Air Mail &quot;experiment&quot; of 1934 when the idea originated for a permanent air depot in the Salt Lake City area. In the following years, the USAAC surveyed the region for a suitable location for the permanent western terminus of the air mail. Several sites in Utah were considered, and the present site near Ogden emerged as the clear favorite.

In July 1939, Congress appropriated $8.0 million for the establishment and construction of the Ogden Air Depot. Hill Field officially opened on 7 November 1940.

Following American entry into World War II in December 1941, Hill Field quickly became an important maintenance and supply base, with round-the-clock operations geared to supporting the war effort. Battle-worn warplanes like the A-26, B-17, B-24, B-29, P-40, P-47, P-61, were sent to Hill Field for structural repairs, engine overhauls, and spare parts. The peak wartime employment at Hill Field was reached in 1943 with just over 22,000 military and civilian personnel. Men and women at the depot rehabilitated and returned thousands of warplanes to combat.

Starting in 1944, Hill Field was utilized for the long-term storage of surplus airplanes and their support equipment, including outmoded P-40 Tomahawks and P-40 Warhawks which had been removed from combat service and replaced by newer and better warplanes. P-47 Thunderbolts, B-24 Liberators, B-29 Superfortresses, and many other types of aircraft were also prepared for and placed in storage at Hill throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

Hill Field became the Hill Air Force Base on 5 February 1948, following the creation of the United States Air Force. During the Korean War, Hill AFB was assigned a major share of the Air Materiel Command&#x27;s logistical effort to support the combat in Korea. Hill AFB personnel quickly removed needed warplanes from storage, renovated them, and added them to active-service USAF flying squadrons.

Then during the 1960s, Hill AFB began to perform maintenance support for various kinds of jet warplanes, mainly the F-4 Phantom II during the Vietnam War, and then afterward, the more modern F-16 Fighting Falcon, A-10 Thunderbolt II and C-130 Hercules, and also air combat missile systems and air-to-ground rockets. Hill AFB continues to carry out these tasks to the present day.

== Role and operations ==

=== Ogden Air Logistics Complex ===
The Ogden Air Logistics Complex provides worldwide engineering and logistics management for the F-35 Lightning II, F-16 Fighting Falcon, A-10 Thunderbolt II, and Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile.

=== 75th Air Base Wing ===
The 75th Air Base Wing is responsible for the base operating support of all units at Hill AFB. The 75th ABW provides base operating support for the Ogden Air Logistics Complex, the 388th and 419th Fighter Wings, and 50+ mission partner units.

=== Hill Aerospace Museum ===
Hill AFB has also housed the Hill Aerospace Museum since 1981. This contains more than 80 retired USAF, U.S. Army Air Forces, U.S. Navy and former Warsaw Pact fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and missiles.

===Utah Test and Training Range===
The Utah Test and Training Range is one of the only live-fire U.S. Air Force training ranges within the United States. It is located in far western Utah, close to the Nevada border, and it extends both north and south of Interstate Highway 80, with several miles of separation on each side of the Interstate Highway. The portion of the bombing range that lies north of Interstate 80 is also west of the Great Salt Lake. The Utah Test and Training Range lies in Tooele County, and the land is owned by the state of Utah, but the use of the airspace and training exercises are scheduled by Hill AFB.

On September 8, 2004, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s Genesis space probe crash-landed on the nearby U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, as planned.

==Connections to the Hi-Fi murders==
Three enlisted United States Air Force airmen stationed at Hill AFB – Pierre Dale Selby, William Andrews and Keith Roberts – were convicted in connection with the Hi-Fi murders, which took place at the Hi-Fi Shop in Ogden, Utah, on April 22, 1974. Selby and Andrews were both sentenced to death for murder and aggravated robbery while Roberts, who had remained in a getaway vehicle, was convicted of robbery. Evidence gathered from a trashbin on base and from the perpetrators&#x27; barracks was instrumental in their convictions.

One of the survivors of the attack, Cortney Naisbitt, later trained in computers and worked at Hill Air Force Base.

==Accidents and Incidents==
* August 24, 1970 Universal Airlines Lockheed L-188C Electra N855U departed Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah on an Air Force Logair flight to Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. The aircraft departed without all its hydraulic systems in operation, leaving insufficient elevator authority, resulting in the aircraft nosing over into the ground. The aircraft was destroyed but the crew escaped with injuries. The investigation found fault with the captain and flight engineer for not following approved procedures and directives.
* March 19, 1972 Universal Airlines Lockheed L-188C Electra N851U was on a ferry flight from Tucson, Arizona to Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah when it developed an engine overspeed issue, complicated by an inability to feather. The aircraft landed at Hill just after midnight, whereupon the engine exploded, destroying a large portion of the left wing and causing a substantial fire. The crew had minor injuries but the aircraft was a writeoff. The crew was cited in the investigation for improper procedures.
* November 18, 1979: Transamerica Airlines Lockheed L-188C Electra N859U operating Logair flight 3N18 for the US Air Force departed Hill Air Force Base en-route to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas. While climbing between 12,000 and 13,000 ft, all electrical power was lost; the crew requested an immediate descent. The aircraft attained high airspeed and high rate of descent and disintegrated in flight, killing all three crew members. Probable cause was progressive failure of the electrical system leading to disabling or erratic performance of critical instruments and lighting in night-time instrument conditions. The crew became disoriented and lost control. The aircraft was inherited from Universal Airlines via Saturn Airways and was the third current or former Universal Airlines Electra to have an accident at Hill AFB.
*May 9, 1981: During the an Air Show to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the base, Thunderbird Captain Nick Hauck, and 2 livestock were killed when Hauck&#x27;s T-38 Talon Lost power on approach to the runway. The plane was reported to cartwheel several times before exploding. Hauck was killed on impact, while the Livestock were killed by debris.
*June 20, 1998: An F-16C Falcon Crashed after taking off from the runway during a routine test flight. The F-16 from the 514th Test Squadron was destroyed, pilot ejected with minor injuries.
*October 19, 2022: A Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II crashed off the end of runway 14. The 388th Fighter Wing has stated that the solo pilot was seen by a local hospital and released with no injuries.

<doc id="556323" wikidata="Q167412" url="?curid=556323" title="Settlement (litigation)">
<text>In law, a settlement is a resolution between disputing parties about a legal case, reached either before or after court action begins. A collective settlement is a settlement of multiple similar legal cases. The term also has other meanings in the context of law. Structured settlements provide for future periodic payments, instead of a one time cash payment.

==Basis==
A settlement, as well as dealing with the dispute between the parties is a contract between those parties, and is one possible (and common) result when parties sue (or contemplate so doing) each other in civil proceedings. The plaintiffs and defendants identified in the lawsuit can end the dispute between themselves without a trial.

The contract is based upon the bargain that a party forgoes its ability to sue (if it has not sued already), or to continue with the claim (if the plaintiff has sued), in return for the certainty written into the settlement. The courts will enforce the settlement. If it is breached, the party in default could be sued for breach of that contract. In some jurisdictions, the party in default could also face the original action being restored.

The settlement of the lawsuit defines legal requirements of the parties and is often put in force by an order of the court after a joint stipulation by the parties. In other situations (as where the claims have been satisfied by the payment of a certain sum of money), the plaintiff and defendant can simply file a notice that the case has been dismissed.

The majority of cases are decided by a settlement. Both sides (regardless of relative monetary resources) often have a strong incentive to settle to avoid the costs (such as legal fees, finding expert witnesses, etc.), the time and the stress associated with a trial, particularly where a trial by jury is available. Generally, one side or the other will make a settlement offer early in litigation. The parties may hold (and indeed, the court may require) a settlement conference, at which they attempt to reach such a settlement.

In controversial cases, it may be written into a settlement that both sides keep its contents and all other information relevant to the case confidential or that one of the parties (usually the one being sued) does not, by agreeing to the settlement, admit to any fault or wrongdoing in the underlying issue.

A &quot;global settlement&quot; is one employed where suits have been filed or charges brought in multiple jurisdictions and is defined as &quot;a legal agreement that addresses or compromises both civil claims and criminal charges against a corporation or other large entity&quot;. Examples of a global settlement include the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement between the attorneys general of 46 U.S. states and the four major U.S. tobacco companies in 1999. Another example is within the Global Analyst Research Settlements.

==Specific jurisdictions==
===United States===
Usually, lawsuits end in a settlement, with an empirical analysis finding that less than 2% of cases end with a trial, 90% of torts settle, and around 50% of other civil cases settle. In American law, settlement agreements are normally private contracts, not court orders, except for consent decrees, which are relatively uncommon in the United States.

====Confidentiality ====
Most settlements are confidential. In these cases, the court order may refer to another document which is not disclosed, but which may be revealed to prove a breach of the settlement. Confidentiality is not possible in class action cases in the United States, where all settlements are subject to approval by the court pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and counterpart rules adopted in most states.

In some cases, confidential settlements are requested in discovery. Federal courts can issue protective orders preventing the release, but the party seeking to prevent disclosure must show that harm or prejudice would result from the disclosure. In specific states such as California, however the burden is on the party seeking release of the confidential settlement.

====Limitations====
The confidentiality of settlements is controversial as it allows damaging actions to remain secret, as occurred in the Catholic sexual abuse scandal. In response, some states have passed laws which limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a &#x27;Sunshine in Litigation&#x27; law which limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards. Washington State, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws. In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015. Confidentiality agreements which keep secrets from regulators about violations is probably unenforceable, but a specific carveout granting regulators access is usually not included.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, if the matter is already before the courts, except in a case where the claim is to be dismissed outright and the Claimant agrees to pay the Defendant&#x27;s costs, the matter is usually dealt with by a consent order, signed by the legal representatives of both parties and approved by the judge.

To get around the issue of confidentiality referred to above, a standard procedure consent order, known as a Tomlin Order is entered into. The order itself contains an agreement that the claim is stayed and no further action can be taken in court (except for referring a dispute in the implementation of the order to court, which is allowed). The order also deals with payment of costs, and payments of money out of court if any money is held by the court (as these are matters which must be dealt with by Court Order). However, the actual terms of the settlement are dealt with in a &#x27;schedule&#x27; to the order, which can remain confidential. Breach of the schedule can be dealt with as breach of contract, or breach of the consent order.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, which is a common law jurisdiction, settlements almost always are submitted to the court, for two reasons: (a) only by submitting the settlement to the court can the litigants control whether the court will order one or more parties to pay costs, and (b) the plaintiff (claimant) usually prefers for the settlement to be given the effect of a judgment.

<doc id="556324" wikidata="Q320300" url="?curid=556324" title="Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey">
<text>Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey, (circa 23 October 1729 – 14 November 1807) was a British Army officer. He was a distinguished soldier in a generation of exceptionally capable military personnel, serving crucially in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), the American Revolutionary War, and the French Revolutionary Wars.

He served in the American War of Independence (1775–1783), rising to be Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in America. Following the Battle of Paoli in Pennsylvania in 1777 he became known as &quot;No-flint Grey&quot; for reputedly ordering his men to extract the flints from their muskets during a night approach and to fight with bayonets only. He later fought in the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802), capturing Martinique as leverage to force the Treaty of Amiens, and was appointed as Governor of Guernsey.

== Early life ==
Grey was born at his family estate Howick Hall, 30 miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne and one mile from the North Sea. His exact birthdate is unknown, but he was baptized 23 October 1729, so he was probably born in October. He was the third son of Sir Henry Grey, 1st Baronet, of Howick and his wife Lady Hannah Grey (née Wood), daughter of Thomas Wood of Fallodon in Northumberland. Because he had two older brothers, Grey did not expect to inherit his father&#x27;s titles and estates, so he pursued a career in the army. His two older brothers Sir Henry and Thomas both died without issue, leaving him as the viable heir.

== Military career ==
In 1744, with financial assistance from his father, Grey purchased a commission as an ensign in the 6th Regiment of Foot. He soon went to Scotland with the Sixth Regiment to suppress the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Following victory there, the Sixth Regiment spent the next few years in Gibraltar. In December 1752, he purchased a lieutenancy in the Sixth Regiment. In March 1755, he formed a new independent company and became their captain. Two months later, he purchased a captaincy in the 20th Regiment of Foot (subsequently titled &#x27;East Devonshire Regiment&#x27;, and in 1881 the Lancashire Fusiliers), in which James Wolfe served as lieutenant colonel. In 1757, while with Wolfe&#x27;s regiment, he participated in the unsuccessful attack on Rochefort.

=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===

In the Seven Years&#x27; War, he served as adjutant in the staff of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick and on 1 August 1759 was wounded at Minden. On 14 October 1760 he commanded a Light Company at the Battle of Campen, where he was again wounded. One year later, as Lt. Colonel of the 98th Regiment of Foot (1761), he participated in the Capture of Belle Île, off the coast of Brittany. Next, he served at the Battle of Havana in 1762. Later, he was on the staff of Wilhelm, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe during the Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762). In 1763 he retired on half-pay, but in 1772 he received a promotion to Colonel and served as aide-de-camp to King George III.

=== American War of Independence ===
During the American War of Independence he was one of the more successful army leaders. He was rapidly promoted, becoming a major general in 1777 and commanded the 3rd Brigade at the Battle of Brandywine. He earned the nickname &quot;No-flint Grey&quot; after the Battle of Paoli in the same campaign when, to ensure surprise in the night attack on an American encampment, it was said he ordered the infantry of his command to remove the flints from their muskets and use only their bayonets. In fact, he only directed that muskets should be unloaded. He commanded the 3rd Brigade again at the Battle of Germantown and the Battle of Monmouth. Immediately following his disastrous retreat at the Battle of Monmouth, the American General Charles Lee excused himself from criticism by complaining that he had directly faced the advance Grey&#x27;s 3rd brigade, suggesting the Earl was a feared and respected opponent by this stage in the war.

In 1778 he led raids at New Bedford on 5–6 September, destroying nearly all the shipping and burning twenty shops and twenty-two houses in the town, and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where between 10 and 15 September, the British carried off all the sheep, swine, cattle and oxen that they could find with promise of payment in New York. On 27 September 1778, Grey used the same methods as he had at the Battle of Paoli in a night attack at Old Tappan, New Jersey, which came to be known as the Baylor Massacre. He was recalled to England and became a knight of the Order of the Bath and a lieutenant general. He later was appointed commander-in-chief of the British troops in America, but hostilities ended before he could take command.

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===

At the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, Sir Charles Grey was appointed commander of the West Indian expedition. First, however, he went to Ostend to participate in the relief of Nieuwpoort, Belgium. In early 1794, he and Admiral Sir John Jervis led a British force to capture Martinique. The campaign lasted about six weeks with the British capturing Fort Royal and Fort Saint Louis on 22 March, and Fort Bourbon two days later. The British then occupied Martinique until the Treaty of Amiens returned the island to the French in 1802. Grey was later involved in the invasion of Guadeloupe. Between the years of 1797 and 1807 General Grey held the position of Governor of Guernsey.

== Peerage ==
In late 1794 he returned to England. From 1798 to 1799 he served as Commander of the Southern District, retiring in 1799. In acknowledgment of his service, he was raised in January 1801 to the peerage as Baron Grey, of Howick in the County of Northumberland. In 1806, he was created Earl Grey and Viscount Howick, in the County of Northumberland. He died the next year, at the age of 78.

== Family ==
A member of the House of Grey, he married Elizabeth Grey (1744–1822), daughter of George Grey of Southwick (1713–1746). Their children were:

* Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, (1764–1845), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and abolisher of slavery, married Mary Elizabeth Ponsonby.
* Sir George Grey (1767–1828), Flag Captain under Admiral Jervis, Flag Captain of King George III&#x27;s Royal Yacht (1801–04), married Mary Whitbread, daughter of Samuel Whitbread (1720–1796).
* Sir Henry George Grey (1766–1845), Colonel in the 13th Light Dragoons, who married Charlotte Des Voeux (1789–1882).
* Lady Elizabeth Grey (1765–1846) married Samuel Whitbread .
* Lt. Col. William Grey (1777–1817) married Maria Shirreff.
* Edward Grey (1782–1837) Bishop of Hereford married firstly Charlotte Elizabeth Croft, secondly Elizabeth Adair, and thirdly Eliza Innes.
* Lady Hannah Althea Grey (1785–1832) married firstly George Edmund Byron Bettesworth and secondly Edward Ellice .

Grey and his wife brought up Eliza Courtney, the illegitimate daughter of their son Charles with Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire.

<text>Joey Yung (, ; born 16 June 1980) is a Hong Kong singer signed to Emperor Entertainment Group. Since her debut in 1996, Yung has won numerous awards, including the JSG Most Popular Female Singer and Ultimate Best Female Singer – Gold awards a record-breaking nine times. She was ranked 63rd on the 2014 &quot;Forbes&quot; China Celebrity 100, making her the most influential Hong Kong–based female singer that year. In 2014, she reportedly earned HK$80 million (US$10.3 million).

==Early life==
Yung was born on 16 June 1980 at Yan Chai Hospital in Tsuen Wan elder to one brother. She has ancestral roots from Xinhui, Guangdong. She attended Ma On Shan Lutheran Primary School, where she was classmates with Wong Cho-lam in her sixth grade.

At the age of fifteen, Yung competed in the Big Echo Karaoke Singing Contest and was subsequently signed by Go East Entertainment Co., Ltd. As an artist under Go East, she recorded the song &quot;The First Time I Want to be Drunk&quot; as a theme song for a film but did not gain much recognition and was dropped by the label not long after. She continued to attend school while working as a clerk and helping her mother manage a fashion boutique. Later, an ex-colleague from Go East introduced her to Pony Canyon. However, not long after she joined the company, Pony Canyon shut down its Hong Kong branch.

== Career ==

===1998–1999: Debut ===
In 1998, Yung signed with the Hong Kong record label Fitto Entertainment. In 1999, she was sent abroad for training and began to receive singing lessons from Teresa Carpio and Roman Tam, whom she accompanied on concert tours to gain experience as a performer. By that point, she had graduated from the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education with a diploma in tourism.

On 30 September 1999, she released her debut EP, &quot;EP 1 Joey&quot;. It sold 130,000 copies in Hong Kong and remained on the IFPI Album Charts for 2.3 weeks.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In February 2000, Yung&#x27;s apartment in Happy Valley was destroyed in a fire. That year, she made her first film appearance in &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; and her first television drama appearance in &quot;The Green Hope&quot;. She also released her second EP, titled &quot;EP 2 Can&#x27;t Afford to Miss&quot;, and her first studio album, &quot;Who Will Love Me&quot;. At the same time, she fronted campaigns for several brands including Four Seas, the Red Cross, and Netvigator, and held her first concert, Joey Yung&#x27;s &#x27;See You Everywhere&#x27; Live Concert, at the Hong Kong Coliseum.

In 2001, Yung released her first compilation album &quot;Love Joey&quot;, which became the best-selling album of the year, followed by two Cantonese albums, &quot;All Summer Holiday&quot; and &quot;Solemn on Stage&quot;. In November, she held her second live concert and first concert series, H2O+ &#x27;Solemn on Stage&#x27; Joey Yung Live in Concert 2001 at the Hong Kong Coliseum. She launched her singing career in Taiwan with the release of her first Mandarin album &quot;Honestly&quot;.

In 2002, she traveled abroad for two months to undergo dancing lessons, returning to Hong Kong to release the Cantonese album &quot;Something About You&quot;. She then became the spokesperson of Nissin and Nikon. On 11 October, she released the Mandarin album &quot;One Person&#x27;s Love Song&quot;, and at the end of the year, she released her second compilation album, &quot;Love Joey 2&quot;.

In 2003, Yung&#x27;s became well known for the song &quot;My Pride&quot; (我的驕傲) (the theme song of the TV commercial for Banyan Garden developed by Cheung Kong Holdings), released on 25 March on the album of the same name. That year, she became the spokesperson of a slimming parlour, losing some baby fat and presenting a new image. She released the album &quot;Show Up!&quot; on 30 September and held her third concert, Show Up! Live at the Hong Kong Coliseum. On 17 December, she released the Mandarin album &quot;Sola Portrait&quot; (獨照). At the end of the year, she dominated all the major Hong Kong music awards ceremonies, winning a handful of prestigious awards, including the JSG Most Popular Female Singer award and the Gold Song-Gold award (金曲金獎) at the JSG Best Ten Music Awards Presentation for &quot;My Pride.&quot; She also won her first Best Female Singer-Gold award at the CRHK Music Awards, becoming the award&#x27;s youngest ever recipient, and the Media Award for the artist who had accumulated the most awards from the four music award ceremonies in Hong Kong. Following this, she began the Show Up World Tour, which included dates in Canada, Australia, the United States, Mainland China, Macau, and Malaysia.

In 2004, Yung released the studio album &quot;Nin9 2 5ive&quot; and her first photo album &quot;The Real Joey, Glamour in London&quot;. The photo album was well received by the public and sold out shortly after its release. Her second album in 2004, &quot;Give Love a Break&quot;, was also a commercial success, breaking the platinum mark with pre-orders alone. At the end of the year, Yung released a Cantonese cover of &quot;Chihuahua&quot; (a song previously released in English by DJ BoBo) as part of a Coca-Cola advertising campaign in Hong Kong. At the year-end music awards, she won over 20 awards and received the highest honour award again, the Media Award. It was estimated that for 2004, her income was HK$60 million, including her income from endorsements alone, amounting to HK$10 million.

In 2005, Yung released her third compilation album, &quot;Love Joey 3&quot;, as well as a new Cantonese studio album, &quot;Bi-Heart&quot;. Her fourth major concert, Reflection of Joey&#x27;s Live Concert, spanned eight days in October and November. The concert&#x27;s theme song, &quot;好事多為&quot;, was mixed and re-arranged in South Korea, resulting in the &quot;好事多為 Reflection Mix&quot;. EEG was sponsored by Sony Ericsson for the theme song&#x27;s music video. Following the success of the concert, its CD/VCD/DVD was certified triple platinum, selling 120,000 copies, and Yung&#x27;s album sales surpassed five million worldwide, an impressive feat in the Cantopop industry (in which an average album will sell around 100,000 copies). However, Yung suffered from strained vocal cords and had to work for several days without talking in an effort to relax her vocal cords. She also spent several days receiving remedial acupuncture treatment in Nanjing and took singing lessons under vocal coach Christine Samson, known for teaching corrective singing techniques to many Cantopop singers. That year, she purchased two connecting flats named The Legend at Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, Hong Kong, for HK$40 million.

On 27 February 2006, Yung released her tenth Cantonese studio album, &quot;Ten Most Wanted&quot;. According to Yung, the album was more experimental and had higher production values than her previous albums. She worked with Mavis Fan for two songs on the album; &quot;Get Fit with Jane Fonda&quot; and &quot;Torn Tongue&quot;, both of which had lyrics by Yiu Fai Chow. On 21 July, she released a Mandarin album, &quot;Jump Up – 9492&quot;.

At the end of 2006, Yung released the Cantonese album &quot;Close Up&quot; to commercial success, selling out at stores over Hong Kong as well as online CD stores. A second version of the album was released on 26 January 2007, containing a bonus DVD with music videos for the songs &quot;Splendid Encounter (華麗邂逅)&quot; and &quot;Elated Heart (心花怒放)&quot;. Around the same time, Yung held a concert organised by Neway with appearances from other artists such as Anthony Wong, at17, Hins Cheung, Yumiko Cheng, Vincent Wong, and Sun Boy&#x27;z.

In 2007, she became Hong Kong&#x27;s ambassador of the World Vision 30 Hour Famine campaign and visited Kenya in March. On 5 July, she released her fifth Mandarin album, &quot;Insignificant Me&quot;, with the title track produced by Jay Chou. It was one of her worst selling Mandarin albums. On 7 July, she performed at the Live Earth concert in Shanghai. On 7 November, she released another album, &quot;Glow&quot;.

In early 2008, Yung released her fourth compilation album &quot;Love Joey 4&quot; and held her fifth concert titled StarLight Live over ten days at the Hong Kong Coliseum. During the concert, she performed &quot;The Power Medley&quot;, a 20-minute intense dance medley of her fast-tempo tracks. The concert&#x27;s success led to a four-night extension. In February, Yung travelled to New York City with the hope of improving her dancing skills. That year she sang a number of official songs for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and began a world tour shortly afterwards with shows in Malaysia, Canada, the United States, Mainland China, Singapore, and Macau.

The year 2009 marked the tenth anniversary of Yung&#x27;s career with EEG. To celebrate the occasion, two albums (&quot;A Time For Us&quot; and &quot;Very Busy&quot;) and a documentary were released, and a mini-concert (Perfect Ten Live at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre&#x27;s Grand Theatre, where Yung won her first major singing contest in 1995) was held on 4 October, with tickets for the two shows selling out within seven minutes. The &quot;Perfect Ten Live Boxset&quot; was released in two versions in December: the standard version included two concert DVDs, the &quot;Perfect 10&quot; documentary, and a photo album, while the deluxe version contained two more CDs from Perfect Ten Live and more photos. Towards the end of the year, Yung performed at the concert Music Is Live with Mobile Chan and won the Media Award for the third time (having previously won the award in 2003 and 2004).

===2010–2019===
On 29 January 2010, the 10th Anniversary EP titled &quot;Joey Ten&quot; was released together with the &quot;Joey Ten Boxset&quot;. The EP consisted of 10 different covers (9 for Version 1 and 1 for Version 2) and five songs. The &quot;Joey Ten Boxset&quot; included a photo album, stickers, a thank you card from Yung, a &#x27;Chofy&#x27; bookmark, a comic book, a &#x27;Chofy&#x27; USB, a DVD, and the new EP (&#x27;Chofy&#x27; is plush that represents Joey and the name is a combination of her Chinese name and Miffy). Three songs were promoted from the EP and all were charted at number one on three or more charts. In March, Yung concluded her &quot;StarLight Tour&quot; with two final shows in Sydney and Melbourne. On 20 August, she released another EP, &quot;EP2010&quot;, and in November she began her &quot;Number6&quot; concert, which was her sixth major solo concert held at the Hong Kong Coliseum.

In 2011, Yung took a break for the first time since 2002 and travelled around the world. She stated that she would be focusing on the Mandarin-language market after the break, recording a new Mandarin album and carrying out promotions in Taiwan and Mainland China. On 26 April 2011, Yung became the first Chinese female singer to perform at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall and t\e third Chinese singer overall, after her mentor Roman Tam in 1979 and Eason Chan in 2010. This was her first concert in Europe. On 23 September 2011, Yung released her 21st studio album, &quot;Joey &amp; Joey&quot;. From the album, the song &quot;13:00 (13點)&quot; took the number one spot on three of the four major Hong Kong music charts, and the songs &quot;The Tree with a Thousand Flowers (花千樹)&quot; and &quot;Wallpaper (牆紙)&quot; were number ones on all four charts. &quot;Joey &amp; Joey&quot; became the highest-selling local album of the year. Yung also starred in the film &quot;Diva&quot;, produced by Chapman To.

During the first half of 2012, she continued to tour with her &quot;Number 6&quot; concert in Macau, Reno, Atlantic City, and Toronto. In July, she released her seventh Mandarin album &quot;Moment&quot;, from which she promoted the songs &quot;Right Time (正好)&quot;, &quot;Looking at Flowers Through the Fog (霧裏看花)&quot;, and &quot;Increase Power (加大力度)&quot;. That year, she sang the theme song &quot;Drama Series (連續劇)&quot; for the TVB show &quot;The Hippocratic Crush&quot; and received a total of fourteen awards at the four major awards ceremonies.

In May 2013, Yung released her first single of the year, &quot;View in a New Light (另眼相看)&quot;. On 29 June, she performed the last date of her &quot;Number6&quot; world tour in Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore. On 15 August, she released the album &quot;Little Day&quot;, which went 4× Platinum. She followed the album up with two compilation albums, the &quot;Hopelessly Romantic Collection&quot; (released 3 December) and the &quot;All Delicious Collection&quot; (released 20 December).

Between December 2013 and October 2015, she performed in the &quot;Ageas Joey Yung in Concert 1314&quot; tour, beginning at the Hong Kong Coliseum and holding dates in China, Malaysia, and the United States. In 2014, Yung suffered another period where she lost her voice and had to take care of family illness. In 2015, Yung performed in concert with Hacken Lee, and she released the EP &quot;Me, re-do&quot; in April. In 2016, Yung appeared alongside Hacken Lee on the Chinese television series &quot;I Am a Singer&quot; as the second substitute singer of the season and was eliminated before the second round of the finale.

Between 24 March and 15 April 2017, in a concert was on the drawing board for 6 years, Yung performed in &quot;My Secret Live&quot; in the Concert Hall of Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. It is a concert where all songs are non-promotional side-tracks from all her albums. The venue itself is also lesser known and smaller, as the total full attendance in the 17 shows combined would not amount to half the capacity of the Hong Kong Coliseum. On 31 October 2017, as Yung shifted her focus on commercial sponsorships and various ambassadorial work with Twins, she decided that she would not attend any music awards for the first time in her career in 2017/18 awards season, which was also due to her having no album releases or new works either as a singer or actress in 2017, meaning she would give up defending all her titles during the awards season.

On August 24, Joey Yung held the nineteenth &quot;Pretty Crazy Joey Yung Concert Tour&quot; at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Joey Yung invited many famous singers to the concert as guests, including Andy Lau, Leon Lai Ming, Jacky Cheung, JJ Lin, Nicholas Tse, Ekin Cheng, Jeff Chang, Louis Koo, Kenny Kwan, The Grasshopper, Julian Cheung, Leo Ku, Hacken Lee, etc.

=== Since 2020: COVID-19 and onward ===
Due to the pandemic, Yung spent most of her time from mid-2020 in China. Yung released a Cantonese single in November 2020 entitled &quot;Live in the Moment (東京人壽)&quot;. This also marked the first time Yung participated in the composition of a song she had co-written with Howie from Dear Jane. A special music video for the song was released in December with clips from the &quot;Pretty Crazy Tour.&quot; In February 2021, &quot;Gone with the Flare (煙花紀)&quot; was released. The song title was inspired by the lyrics of her 2009 hit song &quot;In Search of Deities (搜神記)&quot; from the album &quot;A Time for Us&quot;.

The &quot;Pretty Crazy Tour&quot; started on 25 January 2021 with two consecutive shows at The Venetian, Las Vegas. The third show was held in Atlantic City. In Europe, Yung performed in Hague, The Netherlands on 3 March 2020 and in London, England on 9 March 2020. With the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the remaining shows in the world tour were either cancelled or postponed. In January 2021, Yung joined the second season of the Chinese reality series &quot;Sisters Who Make Waves (season 2)&quot; which sees 30 women – all established artists in their own right – compete in various singing and dancing challenges weekly. Cecilia Cheung is also part of the line-up. Yung ranked 2nd during the initial evaluation stage in Episode 1. Yung subsequently led her team to victory for the third public performance. The fifth and final public performance took place in April 2021 and Yung emerged 4th overall in the final results, thus successfully debuting in a team.

Yung released a Chinese single, &quot;So Fresh (featuring Dany Lee),&quot; in August 2021. She joined &quot;The Masked Dancer (season 2)&quot; as a judge and participant. On 29 September 2021, she released a Cantonese single &quot;After All These (不配)&quot;. She also directed the accompanying music video. During a live session, Yung also revealed that she would be releasing her first Cantonese studio album in 5 years by the end of 2021&quot;.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In June 2012, Wilfred Lau publicly announced their relationship which Yung subsequently confirmed. They broke up in 2018. She has openly expressed a pro-establishment stance during the 2019-2020 Hong Kong Protests and was featured prominently in a video campaign by the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; to &quot;oppose violence&quot; and &quot;rebuild Hong Kong.&quot; In March 2021, Yung posted on Weibo, expressing her support for cotton made in Xinjiang, after companies suspended purchasing of cotton from there due to human rights concerns.

<doc id="556330" wikidata="Q1411906" url="?curid=556330" title="List of presidents of the Senate of France">
<text>This article lists the presidents of the Senate of France (; official translation: Speaker of the Senate) and assimilated chambers.

The Senate is the upper house of the French Parliament. It is presided over by a president. Although there had been Senates in both the First and Second Empires, these had not technically been legislative bodies, but rather advisory bodies on the model of the Roman Senate. France&#x27;s first experience with an upper house was under the Directory from 1795 to 1799, when the Council of Ancients was the upper chamber. With the Restoration in 1814, a new Chamber of Peers was created, on the model of the British House of Lords. At first it contained hereditary peers, but following the July Revolution of 1830, it became a body to which one was appointed for life. The Second Republic returned to a unicameral system after 1848, but soon after the establishment of the Second Empire in 1852, a Senate was established as the upper chamber. In the Fourth Republic, the Senate was renamed the Council of the Republic, but its function was largely the same. With the new constitution of the Fifth Republic in 1959, the older name of Senate was restored.

==Acting President of the French Republic==
The president of the Senate, in addition to his duties as presiding officer of the upper house of parliament, is also, according to the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, first in line of succession in case of death, resignation, or removal by impeachment of the president, thus becoming Acting President of the Republic until a new election can be held. This has already occurred twice. Alain Poher, the president of the French Senate, served as Acting President of France from 28 April until 20 June 1969 (between the resignation of President Charles de Gaulle and the installation of his elected successor President Georges Pompidou) and again from 3 April until 27 May 1974 (between the death of President Georges Pompidou and the installation of his elected successor President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing).

<text>Chukwuemeka Ndubuisi Okafor (born September 28, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. Okafor attended Bellaire High School in Bellaire, Texas and the University of Connecticut, where in 2004 he won a national championship. In his first season in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2004–05, Okafor played for the Charlotte Bobcats and was named Rookie of the Year. He was traded to the New Orleans Hornets in 2009 and was then dealt to the Washington Wizards in 2012. However, a herniated disc in his neck caused Okafor to miss four consecutive seasons from 2013 to 2017 before being medically cleared to play.

==Early life==
Okafor was born in Houston, Texas. Both of his parents are natives of Nigeria, and Emeka was the first member of his family born in the United States. His father, Pius Okafor, is a member of the Igbo ethnic group.

Okafor&#x27;s family moved to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, when he was young because his father worked for Phillips Petroleum Company, headquartered in Bartlesville. While in Bartlesville, Okafor&#x27;s father took his son to the Bartlesville YMCA to learn basketball.

==High school career==
Okafor played at Bellaire High School with future Oklahoma State star John Lucas III. Okafor averaged 22 points, 16 rebounds and 7 blocks in his senior season. Bellaire was 26–5 in that season, losing 56–42 in the third round of the 2001 UIL state playoffs, to Willowridge High School and future Texas standout T. J. Ford. This game is particularly notable, however, because it featured five players who would go on to play in an NCAA Final Four (Bellaire had Lucas and Okafor, while Willowridge featured Ford, Oklahoma State&#x27;s Ivan McFarlin and Duke&#x27;s Daniel Ewing). All five of these players went on to play at least a season in the NBA.

Okafor flew under the recruiting radar for much of his high school career, but by the end of his senior year was receiving late interest from top programs and chose to accept a scholarship at the University of Connecticut, choosing the Huskies over Arkansas and Vanderbilt.

==College career==

Okafor played for Connecticut from 2001 to 2004. He was teammates with Charlie Villanueva, Marcus Williams, Ben Gordon, Hilton Armstrong and Josh Boone, who all went on to play in the NBA. He majored in finance and graduated with honors after three years in May 2004 with a 3.8 GPA. Okafor was named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2004 for his work on and off the court.

Okafor is noted for his defensive ability, especially his shot-blocking. Although plagued by back problems for most of the 2003–04 season, Okafor led UConn to the program&#x27;s second national title in six seasons. He was crowned as the NCAA tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player. In addition, Okafor led the nation in blocks that season and was also named National Defensive Player of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. He also received the Big East Player of the Year award. Okafor graduated as Connecticut&#x27;s leader in blocked shots with 441. For his collegiate achievements, Okafor was made a member of the 2004 U.S. National Men&#x27;s Basketball Team that represented the U.S. at the Olympics in Athens.

On February 5, 2007, he was inducted to the Husky Ring Of Honor at Gampel Pavilion on the UConn campus in Storrs during halftime of the men&#x27;s basketball game against the Syracuse Orange as part of a ceremony that recognized the accomplishments of 13 former players and 3 coaches.

==Professional career==

===Charlotte Bobcats (2004–2009)===

====2004–05 season: Rookie of the Year====
On April 16, 2004, Okafor declared his eligibility for the 2004 NBA draft, giving up his one remaining year of college athletic eligibility. He did, however, receive his undergraduate degree in Accounting/Finance in three academic years at the University of Connecticut. On June 24, Okafor was selected second overall in the draft, becoming the first ever draft pick by the expansion Charlotte Bobcats. The following day, he accepted an invitation to join the United States team for the 2004 Summer Olympics, which finished with the bronze medal in Athens.

The 2004–05 season was a successful campaign as Okafor coped well with the pressures of being the star rookie on an expansion franchise. Highlights of the season included recording 19 straight double-doubles from November 21 through January 1, and finishing seventh among Eastern Conference forwards in NBA All-Star Game fan balloting with 408,082 votes, by far the highest number garnered by any rookie in 2005. At the end of the season, Okafor beat out his friend and former college teammate and roommate, Chicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon, to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. 

On June 24, 2005, the Bobcats picked up the option for the fourth year on Okafor&#x27;s contract, as he quickly established himself as the face of the franchise, and a solid player for years to come. Okafor finished his rookie season with 44.7% field goal percentage and per-game averages of 15.1 points, 10.9 rebounds (ranked 4th in the league), and 1.7 blocks.

====2005–06 season====
In the 2005 offseason, Okafor&#x27;s weight increased from 260 to 280 lbs. It was this weight gain which he felt caused him to have trouble rehabbing his early season ankle injury and forced him to sit out most of the 2005–06 season with injuries to his ankle. Nonetheless, in the few games he played he was effective as he averaged a double-double for the second consecutive season. On November 4, 2005, Okafor scored a season high 24 points, alongside grabbing 11 rebounds, in a 110–93 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. For the season he finished with averages of 13.2 points on 41.5% shooting, 10.0 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game.

====2006–07 season====

During the offseason he continued his tutorials with Hakeem Olajuwon, which he took up after his rookie season, and lost the 20 pounds which he had gained for his second season. Okafor felt this weight loss gave him more energy and mobility. He led the Bobcats in rebounds per game, blocks per game, and field goal percentage. On December 29, 2006, in a home game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Emeka would record 22 points, 25 rebounds, and 4 blocks in over 51 minutes of play, in an epic 133–124 triple overtime victory. He also had eight blocks in games against the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics. On January 12, 2007, he would record an NBA season high ten blocks in a game against the New York Knicks. His ten blocks were the most ever recorded in a single game at Madison Square Garden. In that game, he was one rebound away from recording the first ever triple-double in franchise history, finishing with 20 pts, 10 blocks, 9 rebounds, and 3 steals. Later in the season, he suffered an ankle injury which caused him to miss fifteen games. He finished the season averaging 14.4 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 67 games.

====2007–08 season====
Prior to the start of the 2007–08 season, Okafor turned down a contract extension with the Charlotte Bobcats worth an estimated US$60 million over five years. Despite turning down the contract, Okafor maintained that he indeed wanted to remain with the Bobcats. Despite feuding with head coach Sam Vincent throughout the season, Okafor still managed to average a double-double for the fourth consecutive season of his career. He also played in all 82 games of the regular season for the first time in his career. At the end of the season head coach Sam Vincent was fired by part-owner Michael Jordan saying in a statement: &quot;The decision to remove Sam as head coach after just one season was difficult, but it was a decision that had to be made because my first obligation is to do what is in the best interest of our team.&quot;

====2008–09 season====
During the off-season, the Bobcats&#x27; top priority was to re-sign their face of the franchise. Through tough negotiations the Bobcats and Okafor eventually reached an agreement on a six-year, $72 million deal, the largest in franchise history. In a statement, Okafor voiced his pleasure with remaining in the organization now coached by the legendary Larry Brown: &quot;The Bobcats and the entire Charlotte community embraced me from day one, and it&#x27;s exciting to enter this season with a Hall of Fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning.&quot;

Okafor entered the 2008–09 season with active franchise-record streaks of 93 consecutive games played and 92 consecutive games started. That year Okafor played in all 82 regular season games for the second straight season (starting in all but one game) and averaged a double-double for a fifth straight season.

In his final season for the Bobcats, Okafor averaged 13.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game. But at the end of that 2008–2009 season, Bobcats head coach Larry Brown publicly questioned Okafor&#x27;s passion. “I tease him that he’s got an A in stretching and pilates and yoga. I want him to have an A in basketball,” Brown said to reporters two days after Charlotte finished the season with a 35–47 record. “It makes older people feel great, but he’s got to work on his game... There’s no better guy than him, I just want him to have a passion to play the sport because it ends so quickly.”

===New Orleans Hornets (2009–2012)===
On July 28, 2009, Okafor was traded to the New Orleans Hornets in exchange for Tyson Chandler. Charlotte head coach Larry Brown was reportedly willing jettison the franchise&#x27;s first ever draft pick for another 26-year-old center who is three inches taller because it brought financial relief and because, at 6-foot-10, he felt Okafor had trouble guarding the NBA&#x27;s top big men.

During the 2009–10 season, Okafor played in all 82 games for the third season in a row but just missed extending his streak of five seasons averaging a double-double with 10.4 points and 9.0 rebounds per game. Head coach Byron Scott was fired after a disappointing 3–6 start and replaced by GM Jeff Bower. The team finished last in the Southwest Division with a 37–45 record. At the end of the season, Bower stepped down from his coaching duties and returned to his position as a general manager. He was replaced by Monty Williams.

During the 2010–11 season, Okafor helped New Orleans make the playoffs and appeared in his first-ever NBA playoff series. The Hornets finished the regular season 46-36 good for third place in the Southwest Division. Facing the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the postseason, Okafor scored 15 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a 100-86 Game 3 loss, both of which would end up being postseason career highs. The Hornets lost the series 4–2.

The following 2011–12 season, Okafor averaged 9.9 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. But the Hornets struggled and traded away their star point guard Chris Paul plus two second-round draft picks mid-season to the Los Angeles Clippers for Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman, and an unprotected first-round draft pick. On December 28, 2011, Okafor scored 13 points to go with a season-high 6 blocks in a 97–78 win over the Boston Celtics.

===Washington Wizards (2012–2013)===
On June 20, 2012, Okafor was traded, along with Trevor Ariza, to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Rashard Lewis and the 46th pick of the 2012 NBA draft. Okafor went on to be named a finalist for the inaugural Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award for his contributions with the team on and off the court.

On October 25, 2013, days before the start of the 2013–14 season, Okafor was traded, along with a 2014 protected first-round draft pick, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Marcin Gortat, Shannon Brown, Kendall Marshall and Malcolm Lee. However, he missed the entire season due to a herniated disc in his neck that was discovered in September 2013, and remained unsigned throughout the 2014–15 season, the 2015–16 season, and the 2016–17 season. On May 30, 2017, Okafor was medically cleared to play.

===Delaware 87ers (2017–2018)===

On September 25, 2017, Okafor signed with the Philadelphia 76ers. However, he was waived on October 14 after appearing in five preseason games. Later that month, he joined the Delaware 87ers of the NBA G League.

===Return to New Orleans (2018)===
On February 3, 2018, Okafor signed a 10-day contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. He made his Pelicans debut two days later, playing in the NBA for the first time since 2013. He played nine minutes and had three points and two rebounds in a 133–109 loss to the Utah Jazz. He signed a second 10-day contract on February 14, and a rest-of-season contract on February 26. Filling in for the injured DeMarcus Cousins, Okafor averaged 4.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1 block in 26 regular-season games, including 19 starts. He was waived by the Pelicans on September 19, 2018, just before the start of training camp.

Okafor signed with the Philadelphia 76ers on September 21, 2018, before being waived on October 13.

Because Okafor was waived by Philadelphia before the season started, the end of the 2017–18 season with the Pelicans ended up being his final playing time in the NBA. His final game was Game 3 of the 2018 Western Conference First Round against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 19, 2018. The Pelicans won the game 119–102 with Okafor playing minutes and only recording 1 foul as a stat.

===Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus (2019–2020)===
On November 22, 2019, Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus reported that they had added Okafor to their roster. Okafor made his debut for them on December 4, 2019, coming off from bench with a double-double of 11 points, 12 rebounds, two assists and two blocks in a 60–65 loss to the Anyang KGC.

<text>The Cullasaja River () is a short river located entirely in Macon County, North Carolina. It is a tributary of the Little Tennessee River into which it flows near the county seat of Franklin. (The Little Tennessee feeds the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi rivers.)

The Cullasaja originates in the southeast, near Highlands, the county&#x27;s only other town. It flows from manmade Lake Sequoyah, which is fed by Mirror Lake and other creeks and streams originating on the western side of the Eastern Continental Divide, which runs through the east side of Highlands.

A two-lane highway called Mountain Waters Scenic Byway, which is the combined route of U.S. 64 and NC 28, runs through the Cullasaja Gorge. It is mostly protected as part of the Nantahala National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service has designated this as a National Scenic Byway because of the river and its numerous waterfalls, including:

*Bridal Veil Falls, on a tributary creek
*Dry Falls, which visitors can walk behind without getting wet
*Quarry Falls, also known as Bust-Yer-Butt Falls
*Cullasaja Falls, the major cascade of falls

The road is known as Franklin Road near Highlands, and Highlands Road near Franklin. Two townships are located in the valley below the gorge: Sugarfork and Ellijay. The Cullasaja&#x27;s largest tributary is most likely Buck Creek. The most well-known is Peek&#x27;s Creek, where a catastrophic flood and mudslide occurred in September 2004.

Several historic Cherokee towns were located along the Cullasaja River. The town of Ellijay was on Ellijay Creek, a tributary of Cullasaja River. Several Cherokee towns were called &quot;Kulsetsiyi&quot; (or Sugartown), abbreviated Kulsetsi, including one on the Keowee River in South Carolina, and one on the Cullasaja River near Ellijay Creek. &quot;Cullasaja&quot; is a variant spelling of the Cherokee town name &quot;Kulsetsi&quot;. This Cherokee town&#x27;s name is the origin of the name &quot;Sugar Fork&quot;.

One of the largest and most important Cherokee towns, known as Nikwasi, or Nucassee, was located at the confluence of the Cullasaja River and the Little Tennessee River. The town of Franklin developed on the former site of Nikwasi town. What remains of the historic town is an earthwork platform mound, believed to have been built about 1000AD during the South Appalachian Mississippian culture period. After the Cherokee were forced to cede their land here, the mound and related site were privately owned for decades. In 1946 the town of Franklin bought the site to preserve the mound.

The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based on Qualla Boundary, is the only federally recognized tribe in North Carolina. It negotiated with Franklin and set up a non-profit, Nikwasi Initiative, to take over maintenance and control of the mound and small related site. The tribe, town and a regional non-profit Mainspring Conservation Trust, are working to create a cultural corridor along the Little Tennessee River. In 2020 Mainspring bought the Watauga Mound and part of Watauga Town site, another ancient Cherokee site, for transfer to the EBCI. These two sites, together with Kituwa, which the EBCI owns again, will be linked for education and interpretation in this area.

<doc id="556342" wikidata="Q201569" url="?curid=556342" title="Jack Jones (American singer)">
<text>John Allan Jones (January 14, 1938 – October 23, 2024) was an American singer and actor. He was primarily a straight-pop singer (even when he recorded contemporary material) whose forays into jazz were mostly of the big-band/swing music variety. He won two Grammy Awards and received five nominations for Grammys. Notably, he sang the opening theme song for the television series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

Jones continued to perform concerts around the world and in Las Vegas. His recordings include &quot;Lollipops and Roses&quot;, &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot;, &quot;The Race Is On&quot;, &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, and &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;. He also sang the opening theme for the 1968 war film &quot;Anzio&quot; (&quot;This World Is Yours&quot;), as well as the title song for the 1963 film &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot;, which played on a radio in the film contributing to the storyline.

==Musical career==
===Early years and Capitol Records===
Jack Jones was born in Hollywood, California, the morning after his father Allan recorded his signature song &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;, resulting in the younger Jones&#x27; assertion that he was &quot;practically born in a trunk.&quot; Jack attended University High School in West Los Angeles and studied drama and singing. His mother was actress Irene Hervey.

Jack Jones&#x27; first professional break was with his father, who was performing at the Thunderbird Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Jack recorded several demos for songwriter Don Raye, attracting attention from the music industry. In 1959, he was signed to Capitol Records and released the album &quot;This Love of Mine&quot; and a few singles.

===Years at Kapp===
While performing at a San Francisco nightclub, Jack Jones was heard by Pete King, a producer and artist for Kapp Records, who quickly signed him to the label. In August 1961, Jones recorded the ballad &quot;Lollipops and Roses&quot;, which became a hit the next year. His biggest pop hit was &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot;, written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.

During the years Jones was with Kapp, he recorded nearly twenty albums including &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, &quot;This Was My Love&quot;, &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot;, &quot;Dear Heart&quot;, &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot;, &quot;The Jack Jones Christmas Album&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Town&quot;, &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, &quot;The &#x27;In&#x27; Crowd&quot; (providing vocal lyrics to Ramsey Lewis&#x27;s earlier famous jazz instrumental version of 1965), &quot;Jack Jones Sings&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;Our Song&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Lot of Living to Do!&quot;

Jones was an anomaly in the 1960s pop scene, eschewing rock-and-roll trends and opting for a big band sound, lush romantic ballads, and the Great American Songbook style of music, although sometimes he recorded something more pop, country, or bossa nova-oriented. For example, one of his biggest hits was &quot;The Race Is On&quot; by country musician George Jones (no relation). Besides the choice of material, he worked with arrangers like Billy May, Nelson Riddle, Marty Paich, Shorty Rogers, Jack Elliott, Ralph Carmichael, Bob Florence, and Don Costa.

===Years at RCA Victor and MGM ===
Jones moved from Kapp (London Records in the United Kingdom) to RCA Victor in 1967. His first album for the label was &quot;Without Her&quot;. The releases &quot;If You Ever Leave Me&quot;, &quot;L.A. Break Down&quot;, and &quot;Where Is Love&quot; which followed, were in roughly the same style of the Kapp records, but with a somewhat more contemporary vocal styling. &quot;A Time for Us&quot; (1970) was one of the albums which marked his transition toward a more middle-of-the-road sound. He began recording more contemporary material including covers of such well-known songwriters as Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, Carole King, Paul Williams, Richard Carpenter, Gordon Lightfoot, and Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan.

The album &quot;Bread Winners&quot; (1972) was a tribute to the band Bread, with eight songs written by David Gates and two by Jimmy Griffin and Robb Royer. Two more albums from this period were dedicated to two French songwriters: &quot;Jack Jones Sings Michel Legrand&quot; (to Michel Legrand, 1971) and &quot;Write Me a Love Song, Charlie&quot;, featuring songs by Charles Aznavour (1974).

&quot;The Full Life&quot; (1977) was produced by Jones and Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys; on the album, Jones recorded the Beach Boys classics &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Disney Girls&quot;. His last LP for RCA was &quot;With One More Look at You&quot; (1977), which includes a rendition of the Little Feat hit &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;; this performance later resurfaced on &quot;Golden Throats 2: More Celebrity Rock Oddities&quot;. In 1979 he moved to MGM Records, recording the album &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, which featured a disco version of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, the opening theme from &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and his Grammy winner &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot;. His second (and due to MGM&#x27;s closure, his last) MGM album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Now&quot;, features duets with singer Maureen McGovern.

===Later years===
After 1980 Jones recorded few albums and performed in various concert arenas and occasionally appeared on the supper-club circuit. He released the album &quot;Live at the London Palladium&quot; in 1995, recorded in London on the Emporio label. He received recognition in Japan, where many of his earlier records were released on CD. In 1982 he recorded an album for Applause Records, covering songs by the Beatles, Billy Joel, and the Eagles.

<text>Amah Rock (, &quot;Mong Fu Shek&quot;, &quot;husband-watching stone&quot;) is a naturally shaped rock located on a hilltop in southwest Sha Tin District, Hong Kong.

==Description==
The rock is approximately 15 meters in height, and is shaped much like a woman carrying a baby on her back. It stands above the entrance to the Lion Rock Tunnel, within Lion Rock Country Park.

==Legend==
According to a legend, the faithful wife of a fisherman climbed the hills every day, carrying her son, to watch for the return of her husband, not knowing he had been drowned at sea. In reward for her faithfulness she was turned into a rock by the Goddess of the Sea so that her spirit could unite with that of her husband. Similar legends abound throughout the whole of China—the number of rocks called &quot;Mong Fu Shek&quot; in the country is high. Many Chinese classical poems were dedicated to this kind of rock.

==Attraction==
The rock is a popular tourist destination; the whole Sha Tin District can be seen from there. It is also a place of worship for Chinese women and stands as a symbol of women&#x27;s loyalty and faithfulness.

<doc id="556344" wikidata="Q2849816" url="?curid=556344" title="Angus Lewis Macdonald">
<text>Angus Lewis Macdonald (August 10, 1890 – April 13, 1954), popularly known as &#x27;Angus L.&#x27;, was a Canadian lawyer, law professor and politician from Nova Scotia. He served as the Liberal premier of Nova Scotia from 1933 to 1940, when he became the federal minister of defence for naval services. He oversaw the creation of an effective Canadian navy and Allied convoy service during World War II. After the war, he returned to Nova Scotia to become premier again. In the election of 1945, his Liberals returned to power while their main rivals, the Conservatives, failed to win a single seat. The Liberal rallying cry, &quot;All&#x27;s Well With Angus L.,&quot; was so effective that the Conservatives despaired of ever beating Macdonald. He died in office in 1954.

Macdonald&#x27;s more than 15 years as premier brought fundamental changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government spent more than $100 million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government could not afford to participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.

Macdonald was considered one of his province&#x27;s most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.

Macdonald was a classical liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. He believed in individual freedom and responsibility and feared that the growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, the role of the state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.

==Early life and education==
Angus Lewis Macdonald was born August 10, 1890, on a small family farm at Dunvegan, Inverness County, on Cape Breton Island. He was the son of Lewis Macdonald and Veronique &quot;Veronica&quot; Perry, and the ninth child in a family of 14. His mother was from a prominent Acadian family on Prince Edward Island and his maternal grandfather was politician Stanislaus Francis Perry. His father&#x27;s family had emigrated to Cape Breton from the Scottish Highlands in 1810. The Macdonalds were devout Roman Catholics as well as ardent Liberal Party supporters.

In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, the family moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald attended the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of Arts program at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, but his family couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university&#x27;s high school during 1914–15 to pay off his debt. Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses. He was also class valedictorian.

==War service==
The First World War broke out while Macdonald was earning his university degree. In 1915, he underwent military training in the Canadian Officers Training Corps. In February 1916, he joined the 185th battalion, known as the Cape Breton Highlanders, leaving for Britain in October 1916 where he received further training. Macdonald was finally sent to the front lines in France in May 1918 as a lieutenant in Nova Scotia&#x27;s 25th battalion. He participated in heavy fighting and on one occasion led his entire company because all of the other officers had been wounded or killed. Macdonald felt fortunate to have been spared, but his luck ran out in Belgium when he was hit in the neck by a German sniper&#x27;s bullet on November 7, 1918, just four days before the Armistice. Macdonald spent eight months in Britain recovering from his wound. He returned home to his family in Cape Breton in 1919. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that the war had made him &quot;more serious and less self-confident&quot;, but &quot;struck by the willingness of so many to march to horrible deaths in the name of an abstract principle&quot;.

==Life before politics==
In September 1919, the 29-year-old Macdonald began studying at Dalhousie Law School in Halifax. During his two years there, Macdonald formed lifelong friendships with students who were to become members of the political elite in the region. Once again, he excelled in athletics, was elected to the Dalhousie students&#x27; council, became the associate editor of the student newspaper and led the opposition in the law school&#x27;s Mock Parliament. He scored firsts in nearly every course and graduated in 1921 with academic distinction.

Macdonald was hired by the Nova Scotia government as assistant deputy attorney-general immediately after graduating from law school. He worked mainly as an administrator, although he occasionally appeared in court to help the attorney general prosecute a case.

In 1922, Macdonald became a part-time lecturer at the law school. When he left the attorney-general&#x27;s office in 1924, he became a full-time professor. Macdonald was a popular and effective teacher. One former student describes him sitting at his desk on the rostrum speaking slowly and deliberately while gazing intently at the ceiling. &quot;The more students disagreed (with one another in class) the more Angus encouraged it.&quot;

On June 17, 1924, when he was 33, Macdonald married Agnes Foley, a member of a prominent Irish Catholic family. They had worked together in the attorney general&#x27;s office where Foley served as secretary. Between 1925 and 1936, the Macdonalds had three daughters and a son. Agnes raised the children and ran the household after Macdonald entered politics. Biographer John Hawkins writes she eventually helped her husband win election in a Halifax riding with a significant Irish Catholic population. She had a large circle of friends including members of the powerful Liberal Women&#x27;s societies of Halifax. Hawkins also notes that Agnes Macdonald was a gifted hostess who loved conversation. &quot;Quick witted, her rapid and varied flow of language contrasted with Angus L.&#x27;s deliberate, thoughtful manner of speaking, which some have described as a &#x27;drawl&#x27;.&quot;

In 1925–26, while teaching at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses as the basis for full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard&#x27;s faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view was reflected in Macdonald&#x27;s 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.

When the deanship of the law school came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. He apparently had strong support from several members of the university&#x27;s board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.

==Early political career==

===Federal campaign, 1930===
The federal election in the summer of 1930 gave the 40-year-old Macdonald a chance to run for office. He decided to contest the riding of Inverness in his native Cape Breton. There he faced a Conservative opponent whose style contrasted sharply with his own cool and reserved manner. According to biographer John Hawkins, I. D. &quot;Ike&quot; MacDougall &quot;was a gifted performer who before an audience could cut an opponent&#x27;s well-marshalled arguments until they fell amid roars of laughter. He was the master of hyperbole, pun and high spirits. He could win a rural audience, not by his logic, but by his performance on the platform&quot;. Macdonald campaigned hard, but the trend was against him. The Conservatives led by R. B. Bennett defeated Mackenzie King&#x27;s unpopular Liberals. And in Inverness, Ike MacDougall was re-elected by the narrow margin of 165 votes. It was to be Macdonald&#x27;s only election defeat. Afterwards, Macdonald retreated to Halifax where he opened his own private law office in August 1930.

===Provincial convention, 1930===
Macdonald was active in provincial Liberal Party organizational work during the latter part of the 1920s. In 1925, the party had suffered a crushing defeat after 43 years in power. On election day, the Liberals were reduced to three seats in the Nova Scotia legislature. Many believed that the time had come to return the party to its reformist roots. Macdonald worked with other reform-minded members to establish a network of younger Liberals intent on reviving their party.

In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some of their lost popularity in one of the closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 20. Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia&#x27;s economic prospects and the province&#x27;s place within Confederation.

The convention, held on October 1, 1930, proved to be a turning point both for the party and for Macdonald. In a departure from tradition, the party&#x27;s new leader was chosen by convention delegates instead of Liberal caucus members at the legislature. Two veterans of Liberal politics, both wealthy businessmen, were contesting the leadership. There was little enthusiasm, however, for either. Just as nominations were about to close, a delegate from Truro rose unexpectedly to nominate Macdonald. Surprised, Macdonald at first declined the nomination, then agreed to accept it when he sensed strong support on the convention floor. A few hours later, the 40-year-old Macdonald had won a resounding first-ballot victory to become the new Liberal leader.

===Liberal party leader===
After winning the Liberal leadership, Macdonald travelled the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency. As Liberal leader, he proved to be an effective platform speaker. According to biographer John Hawkins, Macdonald&#x27;s &quot;plain talk and simplicity&quot; persuaded audiences of his honesty. He developed the ability to explain political issues with a &quot;clarity that every voter could understand&quot;. When the legislature was in session, he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House. There were six vacancies, but the Conservatives refused to call by-elections fearing they would lose their five-seat majority. Macdonald publicly criticized Premier Gordon Harrington for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation. He deplored what he called &quot;the loss of responsible government.&quot; It was a message that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve responsible government in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer Joseph Howe. Privately however, Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn&#x27;t risk calling a by-election telling one supporter years later, &quot;If the truth must be told, I was sometimes afraid that they would open up a seat and deprive me of this sort of ammunition&quot;.

Macdonald was able to use the theme of responsible government even more effectively during the provincial election campaign of 1933. The governing Conservatives, desperate to avoid electoral defeat, had enacted changes requiring that new voters&#x27; lists be drawn up by government-appointed registrars immediately before each election. Predictably, thousands of Liberal voters were left off the lists and the new law allowed only three days for corrections. The Liberals secured a court order requiring the appointment of additional registrars and some of the disenfranchised voters were finally added to the lists. The so-called Franchise Scandal enabled the Liberal press to cast Macdonald as a latter-day Joe Howe, crusading for the rights of the people. &quot;No newcomer to the political scene&quot;, writes historian Murray Beck, &quot;has ever become so quickly, widely, and favourably known in such a dramatic fashion&quot;. The scandal, compounded by suffering in the province due to the Great Depression, resulted in Macdonald&#x27;s Liberals winning 22 of the 30 seats on August 22, 1933. The Conservatives were now associated in the public mind with corruption and hard times. They did not regain power for 23 years.

==First term as premier 1933–37==
Macdonald was sworn in as Premier of Nova Scotia on September 5, 1933. He was 43 years old and had never held a seat in the legislature. Historian Murray Beck writes that Macdonald&#x27;s cabinet was &quot;probably Nova Scotia&#x27;s strongest&quot;. Biographer Stephen Henderson points out that the &quot;ministers were fresh, motivated and knowledgeable about their portfolios&quot;, although Macdonald himself had no experience in finance. Biographer John Hawkins characterizes the Liberal party of 1933 as &quot;a party of thinkers and reformers&quot;. During the 1930s, Macdonald&#x27;s Liberals took credit for leading the province out of the depths of the Great Depression. As journalist Harry Flemming wrote many years later, Macdonald became &quot;God himself&quot;, the premier who &quot;paved the roads and put the power into every home from Cape North to Cape Sable&quot;.
===Pensions and relief programs===
On his first day in office, Macdonald kept a key Liberal promise by bringing in old age pensions for elderly people in need. Cheques were mailed out to 6,000 pensioners by the end of March 1934. It was a popular move even though monthly pension payments in Nova Scotia were substantially below the national average.

The economic conditions facing the new government were dismal. Tens of thousands of Nova Scotians were impoverished and unemployed. The government expected that 75,000 Nova Scotians would need assistance during the coming winter. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald sympathized with the poor, but he worried that direct government relief payments would undermine their pride and self-respect. Even though direct relief might be cheaper, the Macdonald government preferred to hire the unemployed for public works projects such as paving roads. Henderson reports that in 1933, there were only of paved roads in the province. By 1937, that figure had risen to 605. The government financed such public works by selling low-interest bonds and raising gasoline taxes from six to eight cents a gallon.

Macdonald also urged the federal Conservative government of R. B. Bennett to increase financial support to poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly the responsibility of the provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn&#x27;t afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.

===Jones Commission===
Macdonald tried to deal with the financial imbalances in Confederation by appointing a Royal Commission. He asked it to recommend economic policies the province should follow to lessen the effects of the Depression and to lay out a framework for negotiations with the federal government.

The three-man Jones Commission included Harold Innis, a prominent economic historian who had studied disparities between highly developed manufacturing regions and marginal ones that depended primarily on exploiting natural resources. After touring the province and hearing from more than 200 witnesses, the Commission issued its report in December 1934. Macdonald could take satisfaction in its finding that high tariffs had sheltered central Canadian manufacturing at Nova Scotia&#x27;s expense and that federal subsidies to the province were &quot;seriously inadequate&quot;.

The Commission recommended that the federal government assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald&#x27;s thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia&#x27;s interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.

===Tourism and Nova Scotian identity===
The Macdonald government took practical steps to promote tourism as a way of bringing money into the province. It improved conditions for tourists by granting small loans to hotel, motel and cottage owners to upgrade their facilities. It also offered cooking classes to restaurant and hotel employees. The government&#x27;s extensive road building program made it easier for tourists to travel. But biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald went well beyond these practical steps to promote Nova Scotia as a beautiful and rustic place peopled by colourful Scots, Acadians, Germans and Mi&#x27;kmaq. Government advertising portrayed the province &quot;as a place where urban, middle-class families could go to &#x27;step back in time&#x27;&quot;. Gradually, Henderson maintains, the tourism campaigns created a new identity for Nova Scotians. &quot;They witnessed the provincial state constructing an elaborate network of modern roads; they read books and brochures extolling the beauty of the province, and they heard their premier waxing romantically about the pure, simple nobility of their ancestors.&quot; Macdonald was especially enthusiastic about &quot;the romanticized culture of the Highland Scots&quot;. Historian Ian McKay writes that under his leadership, the provincial government gave money to the Gaelic College; bestowed Scottish names on key tourism sites and stationed &quot;a brawny Scots piper&quot; at the border with New Brunswick. Macdonald also helped assemble more than a quarter of a million acres (4,000 km2) for the Cape Breton Highlands National Park complete with a fancy resort hotel and world-class golf course. &quot;Macdonald believed&quot;, Henderson writes, &quot;he had created a piece of Scotland for tourists in the New World&quot;. And, as more tourists came, Macdonald&#x27;s stature grew.

===Trade Union Act===
The Nova Scotia legislature recognized the growing power of industrial unions in the 1930s by passing what historian Stephen Henderson calls &quot;Canada&#x27;s first piece of modern labour legislation&quot;. Although Macdonald&#x27;s governing Liberals and the opposition Conservatives agreed on the need to protect union rights, the parties vied with each other to take credit for the Trade Union Act. In January 1937, Premier Macdonald carried a bottle of bootleg rum to a meeting with union officials in Sydney, Cape Breton where they gave him a draft bill based on the American National Labor Relations Act. Before the Macdonald government could introduce the bill in the legislature, the Conservatives presented a similar one of their own. The legislation faced opposition from the Canadian Manufacturers&#x27; Association during public hearings, but Liberals and Conservatives combined to pass it unanimously. The new Trade Union Act required employers to bargain with any union chosen by a majority of their employees. It also prohibited employers from firing workers for organizing a union.

===Government patronage===
Nova Scotia&#x27;s well-entrenched system of paying off government supporters with jobs and contracts continued to flourish under the Macdonald Liberals. In his comprehensive history of Canadian patronage, journalist Jeffrey Simpson writes that the Liberals used road improvements to win votes, with highway crews &quot;especially busy before and during election campaigns.&quot; Simpson adds that the Liberals awarded government contracts to companies approved by the party. In return, the firms were required to kickback some of the money they received to the Liberals. Biographer Stephen Henderson argues that Macdonald himself did not relish the traditional practice of filling government jobs with party supporters. Nevertheless, the &quot;wave of partisan hirings and firings&quot; continued as committees in each riding &quot;scrutinized employees for inappropriate political activity and rated prospective candidates based on what they or their families had done for the Liberal party&quot;.

==Second term as premier, 1937–40==
Fortunately for the Macdonald government, economic conditions improved during the 1930s. In March 1937, Macdonald announced that after 14 years of running operating deficits, the Nova Scotia government had recorded a surplus with another forecast for the next year. The pro-Liberal &quot;Halifax Chronicle&quot; gleefully described the scene in the legislature: &quot;the House sat for a moment, as if not comprehending the good news, then rocked with acclaim, at least the Government side of the House did, though the opposition, stilled and stunned-like, sat like figures carved in stone&quot;. Macdonald promised the government would spend another $7.5 million on its popular road paving program overseen by A. S. MacMillan, the veteran Minister of Highways. MacMillan, also Chairman of the Nova Scotia Power Commission, had been extending electrical service into rural areas. He now introduced a rural electrification bill designed to subsidize the cost of providing electricity.

After these preparations, the premier called a provincial election for June 29, 1937. Macdonald campaigned on his government&#x27;s record. On election day, his Liberals were rewarded with 25 of the 30 seats in the legislature.

Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had invited Macdonald to run for federal office during the general election of 1935. Although Macdonald turned him down, there were strong rumours in 1937 that Macdonald would soon enter federal politics. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes however, that Macdonald wanted to remain as premier so he could present Nova Scotia&#x27;s case to a Royal Commission on federal-provincial relations.

===Rowell-Sirois Commission===
The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring weaknesses in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada&#x27;s poorer provinces found it impossible to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald played an important role in shaping the Commission&#x27;s final recommendations.

Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia&#x27;s submission and presented it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He called on the federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers&#x27; allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.

A central part of Macdonald&#x27;s case concerned the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument was based on the premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.

The Commission&#x27;s final report, released in May 1940, reflected many of Macdonald&#x27;s recommendations. Mackenzie King called a federal-provincial conference in January 1941 to discuss the report. The provinces failed to agree on what should be done, but in April, the federal government went ahead on its own announcing it would levy steep taxes on personal and corporate incomes as a temporary measure to finance Canada&#x27;s participation in the Second World War.

===Summons to Ottawa===
The course of Macdonald&#x27;s political career changed sharply after Canada declared war on Germany in September 1939. Three months later, Mackenzie King called a federal election and on March 26, 1940, his Liberals won a decisive victory. In spite of his victory, King was under pressure to recruit the country&#x27;s &quot;best brains&quot; into his wartime cabinet. The death of his minister of defence in an air crash in June 1940 gave King an opportunity to reorganize his administration. He asked J. L. Ralston, a native Nova Scotian, to become his new minister of defence. Ralston agreed but imposed two conditions: First that J. L. Ilsley of Nova Scotia replace him as minister of finance and second that he get assistance in his new portfolio.

King decided to appoint two additional ministers, one in charge of the Royal Canadian Air Force, the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy. He therefore, asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services. Macdonald, who had fought in World War I as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium, decided it was his duty to fight World War II as a political leader in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.

==Wartime federal career, 1940–45==
Macdonald&#x27;s five years in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive increase in Canada&#x27;s naval forces and played a key role in a political crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, a political leader whom Macdonald grew to loathe. When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald&#x27;s federal political career was in tatters.

Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald to stand for a vacant seat in Kingston, Ontario. It was a traditional Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it. &quot;I told Mr. King that I did not know Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people&quot;, Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald had no choice but to stand for office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.

===Building the navy===
Macdonald faced a huge, but critical task in overseeing the expansion of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). As historian Desmond Morton points out, the RCN was tiny when Canada entered the war in 1939. It consisted of six destroyers, five minesweepers and about 3,000 personnel in its regular forces and volunteer reserves. By the time Macdonald took office in 1940, the RCN had grown to 100 ships and more than 7,000 personnel, but as biographer Stephen Henderson notes, &quot;few of its ships and sailors were ready for service at sea&quot;. By the end of the war, the RCN had expanded by 50 times its original strength with about 400 fighting ships, almost 500 additional craft and about 96,000 men and women.

The RCN was assigned the task of escorting supply vessels transporting food and other materials needed to keep the war going. This convoy duty was critically important as German submarines or U-boats sought to starve Britain into submission by sinking supply ships. The RCN performed about 40 percent of the war&#x27;s transatlantic Allied escort duty. Desmond Morton argues it was Canada&#x27;s &quot;most decisive&quot; military contribution. Canada&#x27;s convoy protection efforts did not always run smoothly, however. In the early part of the war, the Canadian navy lacked equipment that could detect underwater submarines as well as efficient radar for sighting ones on the surface. To make matters worse, Canada didn&#x27;t have the long-range aircraft that were the most effective anti-submarine weapons.

As supply ship losses mounted, the RCN struggled to catch up to the better-equipped British and American navies. Macdonald himself lacked military expertise and often depended on senior naval staff who kept him in the dark about equipment shortages and other problems. &quot;Macdonald&#x27;s administration of Naval Affairs did not rise to brilliance&quot;, Henderson writes, &quot;[but] the problem may have lain more with the senior naval staff than with Macdonald&quot;. Macdonald&#x27;s conflict with high ranking naval officers, particularly Rear Admiral Percy W. Nelles, led to the effective dismissal of the latter in 1944. Yet, as the war progressed, the RCN, led by Macdonald, gradually became more effective in protecting the huge cargoes of materials on which Allied victory depended.

===Conscription crisis===
Biographer Stephen Henderson maintains that Macdonald played a key role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.

Nevertheless, Macdonald continued to push the government to commit itself to conscription if circumstances should change. His position earned him the enmity of the politically cautious Mackenzie King. &quot;Macdonald is a very vain man&quot;, the prime minister complained in his diary, &quot;and has an exceptional opinion of himself. Undoubtedly, he came here expecting to possibly lead the Liberal party later on but has found that he will not be able to command the following that he expected&quot;.

As the opposition Conservatives continued to press for overseas conscription, the King government held a national plebiscite on April 27, 1942. The plebiscite asked voters to release the government from its previous promise not to introduce compulsory war service. The results confirmed the sharp national split. English Canada voted strongly in favour and French Canada overwhelmingly against. The results of the plebiscite seemed to strengthen the position of ministers who supported conscription. Macdonald&#x27;s two cabinet colleagues from Nova Scotia, defence minister J. L. Ralston, and finance minister J. L. Ilsley, urged the government to introduce conscription immediately. A more cautious Macdonald wanted the government to commit itself to conscription should it be required to support the war effort. 
The crisis flared again two years later when the Canadian military called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald&#x27;s urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister&#x27;s plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead he sat in his chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald&#x27;s decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government&#x27;s collapse.

In the end, King was forced to impose overseas conscription after the failure of the voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by what he saw as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.

==Provincial premier, 1945–54==
When Macdonald returned to Nova Scotia in 1945, he was only 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20 years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald&#x27;s leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald&#x27;s Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives for the first time since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.

Nevertheless, Macdonald plunged into his role as a leading champion for the provinces. He argued that in order to maintain their independence, provinces needed exclusive jurisdiction over such sources of revenue as gasoline, electricity and amusement taxes. He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights. Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois Commission and redistribute national wealth based on need. Such a policy, he maintained, would enable poorer provinces to sustain government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation. In the end, Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes. The federal government refused to recognize financial need as the basis for provincial subsidies.

Aside from his role as a national spokesman for provincial rights, Macdonald presided over an administration that invested heavily in education. His government financed the building of rural high schools and extended financial assistance to Dalhousie University&#x27;s schools of medicine and law. Macdonald also appointed Nova Scotia&#x27;s first minister of education, Henry Hicks, in 1949 to oversee $7.6 million in spending, about a fifth of the provincial budget.

The Macdonald Liberals easily won re-election in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, drew attention to kickback schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party in exchange for the right to sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however, as long as they were led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital, where he died in his sleep two nights later, at age 63.

Stephen Henderson writes that the Nova Scotia legislature sat on the day of his death. Macdonald&#x27;s seat was draped in Clanranald tartan and a sprig of heather decorated his desk. Macdonald&#x27;s body lay in state for three days in the legislative building as more than 100,000 people filed past to pay their respects.

==Aftermath of Macdonald&#x27;s death==
Macdonald&#x27;s death proved disastrous for provincial Liberals. There was no obvious successor to the popular premier. At the party&#x27;s leadership convention held on September 9, 1954, the Liberals appeared badly split along religious lines. After five ballots, the convention rejected Harold Connolly, a Roman Catholic who had served as interim premier after Macdonald&#x27;s death. Instead they chose the Protestant Henry Hicks. &quot;Unfortunately for the Liberals&quot;, historian Murray Beck writes, &quot;it appeared as if the delegates had ganged up to defeat the only Catholic among the contestants&quot;. Beck also notes that &quot;Nova Scotia governments have always been most vulnerable after a change in leadership&quot;. In the next provincial election held on October 30, 1956, Robert Stanfield and his Conservatives won 24 seats, the Liberals 18. The 23-year Liberal era, begun under Macdonald&#x27;s leadership, had finally ended.

==Assessment and legacy==
Murray Beck writes that Macdonald&#x27;s political appeal to Nova Scotians may have been even stronger than the legendary Joseph Howe&#x27;s. Like Howe, Macdonald was a passionate and eloquent leader whose elegantly crafted speeches reflected his wit, wide learning and respect for factual accuracy. Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises, Macdonald became known as a leader who always kept his word.
Macdonald&#x27;s reputation as the premier who led the province out of the Great Depression rested on his commitment to ambitious government projects such as highway construction and rural electrification. He continued to support highway improvements throughout his career. Two projects that he pushed especially hard for, the Canso Causeway linking Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and a suspension bridge spanning Halifax Harbour were completed after his death. The bridge, named in his honour, made it possible to travel between Halifax and Dartmouth without having to board a ferry or drive several kilometres around the Bedford Basin.

Macdonald consistently called for a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada&#x27;s prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald&#x27;s advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.

Throughout his life, Macdonald maintained ties to his alma mater, St. Francis Xavier University. He received an honorary doctor of laws degree from St. FX in 1946. He served as honorary chair and fundraiser for the university&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1953 and raised money to support student research into the early history of the Scots in Nova Scotia. Macdonald suggested that the reading room in a new university library be called the &quot;Hall of the Clans&quot;. St. FX adopted the idea and decided to name the library in his honour. Thus, when the Angus L. Macdonald Library officially opened on July 17, 1965, 50 coats of arms representing both Scottish and Irish clans adorned the walls of its reading room.

<text>Laurent Patrick Fignon (; 12 August 1960 – 31 August 2010) was a French professional road bicycle racer who won the Tour de France in 1983 and 1984, as well as the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 1989. He held the title of FICP World No. 1 in 1989. Fignon came close to winning the Tour de France for a third time in 1989 but was narrowly defeated by Greg LeMond by 8 seconds, marking the closest margin ever to decide the Tour. Fignon won many classic races, including consecutive victories in Milan–San Remo in 1988 and 1989. He died from cancer in 2010.

==Early life and amateur career==
Fignon was born in Montmartre, Paris. His family moved to Tournan-en-Brie in 1963, where he lived until he left for Paris at age 23.

Laurent Fignon&#x27;s first sport was football, and he reached the level of playing for his &quot;&quot; or area. However, friends persuaded him to try cycling, and in 1976, he participated in his first official race, which he won. Despite his parents&#x27; opposition to his racing, Fignon continued to compete without their knowledge. He won four more races in his first year, but only one in his second year. However, in his third year, he won 18 out of 36 races. Eventually, Fignon&#x27;s parents allowed him to race, though they still believed he should prioritize his studies.

Fignon enrolled at the University of Villetaneuse, where he studied Structural and Materials Science. Fignon was not interested in his studies, and was an indifferent student. His chief desire was to pursue cycling. He eventually informed his parents of his decision to leave university and join the army at the end of the year for his mandatory military service. He was posted at the Bataillon de Joinville, known for its sporting reputation. After this, Fignon was sure he wanted to pursue a professional career.

In 1981, Fignon rode the Tour of Corsica which allowed amateur cyclists to ride along with professional riders. Fignon rode an early stage attempting to hold the wheel of Bernard Hinault, the top professional cyclist, and succeeded for much of the race. Cyrille Guimard observed the young cyclist a few days later at the national 100 km team time trial. Fignon did win on tenth of April 1981 the second stage during Tour du Vaucluse. In May 1981 he offered him a place on his Renault–Elf–Gitane professional team from the following year. Fignon joined the team in 1982, along with longtime friend and fellow junior rider Pascal Jules. Fignon was 21 years of age.

==Professional career==

===1982: first professional season===
In 1982, Fignon rode the 1982 Giro d&#x27;Italia. After Fignon broke away in the second stage, he became the leader of the race, and got to wear the pink jersey. He lost the lead in the next stage, but became Hinault&#x27;s most trusted teammate in the mountains.
In Paris–Tours, Fignon had escaped and made a break of 40 seconds, when his crank broke.
During this first year as a professional, Fignon won the Critérium International.

===1983: first Tour victory===
In 1983, Fignon was a part of the team that helped Bernard Hinault to win the 1983 Vuelta a España. Guimard did not want to send Fignon to the Tour de France, because two grand tours could be too much for a 22-year-old rider. When Hinault, winner of four of the five previous Tours, announced that he would not start due to injury, the Renault team was without a leader. Fignon was added to the 1983 Tour de France selection for the Renault team, and the team decided to go for stage wins, with hopes of having Fignon or Marc Madiot compete for the best debutant category. After stage nine, the first mountain stage, Fignon was in second place, behind Pascal Simon, and he was allowed to be team leader. On the tenth stage, Simon crashed and broke his shoulder blade. Simon continued, and only lost a little time on the next stages. On the fifteenth stage, a mountain time trial, Fignon was able to win back so much time that he was within one minute of Simon.
On the seventeenth stage, Simon had to give up, and Fignon became the new leader. On the next stages, Fignon was able to answer all attacks from his opponents, and he won the time trial on the 21st stage. At 22 years old, Fignon was the youngest man to win the Tour since 1933.

Fignon later said that he was lucky to have won the 1983 Tour: if Hinault had been present Fignon would have helped him, as Hinault was the team leader.

With his round glasses and sophisticated, urbane &quot;(&quot;debonaire&quot;)&quot; demeanor, Fignon was a contrast to Hinault&#x27;s hard-knocks image. He earned the nickname &quot;The Professor&quot;, not only because of these glasses, but also because he was one of the few cyclists who had passed his baccalaureat exams.

Early in his broadcasting career broadcaster and former TDF rider Paul Sherwen referred to Fignon with an alternate version of his nickname during telecasts which into English approximately translates &#x27;The Stern Professor&#x27;.

===1984: second Tour victory===
In 1984, Hinault moved to the new La Vie Claire team, established by the French entrepreneur Bernard Tapie and directed by Swiss coach Paul Koechli. Fignon stayed with the Renault team, and became team leader.
In the 1984 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Fignon was in the lead near the end of the race, with Italian Francesco Moser in second place. The highest mountain stage, where Fignon could have extended his lead as the better climber, was cancelled by race organizers &quot;due to bad weather&quot;. In one of the more outrageous actions of a major tour, on the final stage, an individual time trial, camera helicopters flew in front of Fignon, creating a headwind, and behind Moser, creating a tailwind. Though Fignon repeatedly shook his fists at the obstructing aircraft, they refused to move off. Moser ended up gaining enough time to take the overall race lead, with Fignon being moved back to second place. He later said the experience made him tougher, and prepared him for the hardships to come.

The 1984 Tour de France was a battle between Fignon and his former team leader Hinault. Hinault won the prologue, but Fignon won back time when his team won the team time trial in stage three. After a large escape in the fifth stage, Fignon&#x27;s teammate Vincent Barteau was leading the race. In the seventh stage, Fignon won the time trial, beating Hinault by 49 seconds. Barteau was still leading the race, and remained the leader after the Pyrenées.

In the sixteenth stage, Fignon again beat Hinault in a time trial, this time winning 33 seconds. In the seventeenth stage, Hinault attacked five times on the penultimate climb, but every time Fignon was able to get back. Then, Fignon left Hinault behind, and won almost three more minutes on Hinault. Barteau was so far behind in this stage, that Fignon became the new leader. Fignon won three more stages, for a total of five that year, and won the Tour with a ten-minute margin.

Had it not been for the questionable incidents which occurred at the Giro Fignon would have ended the year having won the Giro-Tour double. With his air of indifference in interviews and his crushing dominance, he was hailed as France&#x27;s newest superstar.

===1985 and 1986: injury years===
Coming into the 1985 season Fignon felt stronger than ever, but two achilles tendon operations caused him to miss the 1985 Tour. The following season his team took on a new sponsor, and became the Système U cycling team. In 1986 Fignon won La Flèche Wallonne and he entered the 1986 Tour de France, but placed poorly in the first individual time trial and retired on stage 12 to Pau.

===1987 and 1988: return to the top===
Fignon returned to near his full strength in 1987, when he finished third in the 1987 Vuelta a España, behind Luis Herrera. Later that year, he finished 7th overall in the 1987 Tour de France, taking another victory at La Plagne (stage 21).
In 1988, Fignon won Milan–San Remo, but had to abandon the 1988 Tour.

===1989: losing by 8 seconds===

In 1989, Fignon overtook Sean Kelly as leader of the UCI Road World Rankings. That season included a win at Milan–San Remo and the Giro d&#x27;Italia. During the Giro he defeated Flavio Giupponi, Erik Breukink and defending champion Andrew Hampsten. Fignon seized the Maglia Rosa on stage 14 and held it for the remainder of the race; he also won stage 20.

In the 1989 Tour de France, 1988 winner Pedro Delgado was the big favourite, with Fignon, Stephen Roche, and Erik Breukink listed together as top contenders. After Delgado was nearly three minutes late for the start of the prologue time trial, the race ended up a battle between Greg LeMond and Fignon. LeMond won a minute in the time trial in stage five, using aerobars which enabled a new and more aerodynamic riding position (also known as tri-bars as they had previously only been used in triathlons), a new type of teardrop-shaped aerodynamic helmet in the time trials and a rear disc wheel, Fignon used normal road handlebars and a bicycle with both front and rear disc wheels, which left him more affected by cross winds. LeMond led the general classification after that stage by 5 seconds. In the tenth stage, Fignon beat LeMond by 12 seconds, and became the new leader, 7 seconds ahead of LeMond. In the time trial of stage 15, LeMond again won time on Fignon, and took back the leading position. Fignon came back by dropping LeMond on Alpe d&#x27;Huez, taking back the lead, and after he won alone at Villard-de-Lans the next day, the margin was 50 seconds.
Before the final stage, a short time trial of 24.5 km, the time difference between LeMond and Fignon was 50 seconds, a seemingly insurmountable amount. To win, LeMond would have to take two seconds a kilometer on one of the fastest time trialists in the Tour. French newspapers prepared special editions, with Fignon&#x27;s picture on the front page, in preparation for his victory. It was considered unlikely that LeMond would be able to win back 50 seconds on the 24.5 km, but he rode the fastest time trial until 2015. Fignon had developed epididymitis in stage 19, which gave him pain and made it impossible to sleep in the night before the time trial. Fignon, who rode after LeMond, lost 58 seconds during the stage. Fignon rode a very fast time trial, and came in third for the stage, but still ended up losing the overall lead to LeMond.
It was suggested afterwards that if Fignon had cut off his ponytail, the reduction in drag might have been sufficient for him to have won the Tour.

During that Tour, he was on bad terms with the journalists. He often refused to smile for photographs, and at one point spat into the lens of a cameraman who asked for an interview. For his efforts the press awarded Fignon the &quot;Prix Citron&quot; (&quot;Lemon Prize&quot;), a prize the press awarded to whom they thought the least likable rider. The loss of the 1989 Tour was a heavy burden for Fignon, and in his autobiography he said &quot;you never stop grieving over an event like that&quot;.

He came back after the Tour de France that year to win decidedly the Grand Prix des Nations time trial, an event that was considered at the time to be the world championships of time trials. This time he used aero handlebar extensions. He also showed his versatility winning the Polynormande, Critérium des As (a race in which each rider motorpaces behind a derny), and the two-man Trofeo Baracchi (which he won with teammate and fellow Frenchman Thierry Marie).

===1990–1993: later years===
Fignon withdrew from the 1990 Tour, but finished 6th in 1991. Following this Fignon moved over to the Italian Gatorade team to act as co-captain and advisor to promising young talent Gianni Bugno. After a dramatic 1992 Giro d&#x27;Italia, in which he was in heavy crisis during mountain stages, he rode his last Tour that same year, finishing 23rd overall. The race saw an angered Fignon take his ninth stage win, holding off a series of attacks by Guimard&#x27;s Castorama team before winning at Mulhouse during stage 11. Fignon&#x27;s last victory as professional cyclist was in the early-season Ruta Mexico in 1993, after a tight duel with Francisco Villalobos and surviving a massive collision that saw the group hit by a tow truck driven by a drunken man. Fignon retired as a professional cyclist late 1993.

==Doping==
Fignon tested positive for amphetamines at the Grand Prix de Wallonie, in 1987, where he finished third. He was subsequently disqualified from the final result but claimed, in his autobiography, that the positive test was the result of a commercial dispute between two Belgian companies.

Fignon tested positive for amphetamines a second time, at the Grand Prix de la Liberation, on 17 September 1989.

In his autobiography, Fignon admitted to using recreational drugs, and occasionally using stimulants in the 1980s. He noted this was widespread, and that the practice would not dramatically change the capabilities of a rider. He noted major changes in the sport in the early 1990s with the onset of routine use of Human Growth Hormone and the blood-booster, EPO. Fignon stated he was revolted by the idea of taking hormones to enhance performance, and the mere suggestion he refused out of hand. He retired from competition in 1993 when he realized that cycling had changed, and that he no longer had a place in it.

==After retirement==
In 1995, Fignon founded the &quot;Laurent Fignon organisation&quot;, to organize races, notably Paris–Nice, from 2000 until it was taken over by Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), the organiser of Tour de France, in 2002. Fignon remained an organiser for races such as Paris–Corrèze.

In response to assertions that French riders were less successful over recent years due to the tight doping controls that French riders are subject to, Fignon responded frankly: &quot;The sports directors don&#x27;t do a good job any more. They lack competence and don&#x27;t have authority over their riders. The non-results of French teams are not only the consequences of doping.&quot;

On his relationships with Cyrille Guimard and Bernard Hinault, Fignon said that with Bernard Hinault, Guimard already found a champion, whereas with himself, Guimard made him a champion. Therefore, his bond with Guimard was stronger than Hinault&#x27;s bond with Guimard.

Fignon wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Nous étions jeunes et insouciants&quot; (&quot;We were young and carefree&quot;), which was released in June 2009.

==Death==
In June 2009, Fignon revealed that he was undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. He noted that early in his career he had dabbled with recreational drugs, amphetamines and cortisone, but did not believe they played a role in his illness. Amphetamine use during the criterium portion (late summer/early fall) of the cycling season was commonplace in the seventies and eighties. Fignon&#x27;s cancer was diagnosed in April 2009 after metastatic tumors were found in his digestive system.
In January 2010, his doctors discovered that the cancer had originated in his lungs. Fignon died at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital on 31 August 2010, at 12.30 pm. He was 50 years old.

His funeral took place on 3 September 2010 at Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, where he was later cremated.

Former fellow champion Greg LeMond said:
&quot;It&#x27;s a really sad day. He had a very, very big talent, much more than anyone recognised. We were teammates, competitors, but also friends. He was a great person, one of the few that I find was really true to himself. He was one of the few riders who I really admired for his honesty and his frankness. We talked about a lot of different things outside of cycling and I was fortunate to really get to know him when my career stopped. I believe he was also one of the generation that was cut short in the early nineties because he was not able to fulfill the rest of his career. But he was a great rider.&quot;
His ashes were placed in the columbarium of the Père Lachaise cemetery.

<doc id="556346" wikidata="Q1980175" url="?curid=556346" title="Brynmawr">
<text>; ; ; ) is a market town, community and electoral ward in Blaenau Gwent, Wales. The town, sometimes cited as the highest town in Wales, is situated at above sea level at the head of the South Wales Valleys. It grew with the development of the coal mining and iron industries in the early 19th century. Until the reorganisation of local authorities in 1974, Brynmawr was administered as part of the county of Brecknockshire.

==Welsh language==
According to the 2011 Census, 6.0% of the ward&#x27;s 5,530 (332 residents) resident-population can speak, read, and write Welsh. This is above the county&#x27;s figure of 5.5% of 67,348 (3,705 residents) who can speak, read, and write Welsh. The town had the only Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gymraeg Brynmawr, in Blaenau Gwent with 310 pupils ranging from nursery to year 6 until 2010, when the school re-located to a brand new, purpose-built building in Blaina.

==History==
Prior to the Industrial Revolution and the founding of Brynmawr, a settlement called Gwaun Helygen (meaning &#x27;marsh of the willows&#x27;) sat on a small area of moorland on the border between the counties of Monmouthshire and Brecknockshire. The village consisted of only a few scattered farm houses, a slew of small tram roads that led to the surrounding coal deposits, a staging inn, and a turnpike road from Abergavenny to Merthyr Tydfil which crossed through the bleak upland plateau.

With the development of Nantyglo ironworks under Crawshay Bailey in the early 19th century, suitable housing was needed for the workers, and thus the area of upland home to Gwaun Helygen was chosen as an ideal area for a settlement. Houses began to spring up around the tram roads and the turnpike road, and the town began to rapidly grow. Although the settlement was not home to any heavy industry, and was for the most part a dormitory town, several above-ground ore deposits outside of town were worked on, and a few underground levels were eventually dug beneath Brynmawr. However, by as early as the 1870s, many of the resources that were once considered abundant had been exhausted, and the local industry began to decline. As the town&#x27;s residents practically solely relied on the surrounding industries, many of them left the town in search of employment, and Brynmawr witnessed a sharp drop in population.
The town&#x27;s market hall, now the Market Hall Cinema was built in 1894, and replaced the older town hall built in 1844.

By the time of the Great Depression, most of the town&#x27;s insured population were unemployed, which attracted the attention of a group of Quakers, whose worked in the town to relieve unemployment culminated in the Brynmawr Experiment.

In 1952, Jim Forrester of Enfield Cables Ltd opened a factory in the town, which was eventually acquired by the Dunlop Rubber Company. Operating under the brand name of Dunlop Semtex Ltd, the factory produced flooring for the health and education sectors up until its closure in 1981. It was demolished in 2001, and now only the boiler house remains, albeit in a derelict state.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Brynmawr, at community (town) and county borough level: Brynmawr Town Council and Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council. The town council has its offices at the Community Centre on Orchard Street and holds its meetings at Brynmawr Institute on Market Square.

===Administrative history===
The area that is now Brynmawr historically straddled three parishes and two counties: the parishes of Llanelly and Llangattock in Brecknockshire, and the parish of Aberystruth in Monmouthshire. A boundary stone at the corner of Boundary Street and Bailey Street marks the point where the three parishes met. A Byrnmawr local board district was established in 1851 covering parts of the two Brecknockshire parishes of Llanelly and Llangattock. The district was enlarged in 1885 to also cover part of the parish of Aberystruth in Monmouthshire.

Elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, which also directed that local board districts that straddled county boundaries, as Byrnmawr did, should be placed entirely in the county which had the majority of the district&#x27;s population. The Monmouthshire parts of the Brynmawr local board district were therefore transferred to Brecknockshire in 1889, such that the whole district was then in Brecknockshire. Local board districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. A civil parish of Brynmawr covering the same area as the urban district was created in 1900. Brynmawr Urban District Council bought Trafalgar House on Alma Street in 1913 to serve as its offices and meeting place, and remained based there until the council&#x27;s abolition.

Brynmawr Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Its area instead became a community called Brynmawr within the new borough of Blaenau Gwent and county of Gwent. The former urban district council&#x27;s functions therefore passed to Blaenau Gwent Borough Council, which in 1996 was reconstituted a county borough, taking over the functions of the abolished Gwent County Council.
==Population==
Brynmawr had an estimated population of 5,568 in 2020. In 2011, 10% of the population were unemployed. 

==Commerce and local economy==

The town centre&#x27;s primary shopping areas are contained within Beaufort Street and on Market Square which is also the focal point of the town where many events are hosted. The former Market Hall is now a cinema and theatre presenting films and productions from the local amateur operatic society. The business community offers many traditional, family-orientated and independently run shops, such as Tutta Bella, Durbans Shoe repairs, Perfectday Bridal, Pebbles and Welch Designs and many more.
The Tabor Centre, situated in Davies Street, is a multi-purpose community venue with rooms available for hire.
Brynmawr is also home to many artisan food producers, such as the award-winning Miss Daisy&#x27;s Kitchen, specialist vegan and gluten-free food producers Daddies Little Pickle, and the Little Dragon Pizza Van, who organise the annual Brynmawr Street Food Festival.

==Places of interest==
Parc Nant y Waun is a nature reserve incorporating of grassland, mires and reservoirs which was officially opened in 2007. Home to many wildlife species, it includes a picnic area, an outdoor classroom, and an angling club.

==Sport and leisure==

Brynmawr RFC is the local rugby union club which is affiliated to the Dragons RFC in Newport.
Brynmawr has a 350-seat cinema (The Market Hall Cinema) which is the longest continually running cinema in Wales. The Market Hall opened in 1893 and has recently been renovated. From November 2016 and throughout early 2017, the Market Hall Cinema had been closed after Blaenau Gwent Council conducted a series of asbestos tests in the building. The Market Hall was successfully reopened by Hollywood star Michael Sheen on 12 July 2017.

Notable people include professional wrestlers Adrian Street and Flash Morgan Webster, singer-songwriters Huw and Tony Williams and indie pop singer-songwriter Marina Diamandis, known professionally as MARINA., T. Rowley Jones was President of Welsh Rugby Union, 1977/78.

Wales and Great Britain Rugby League international Roy Francis, who scored 229 tries in 356 top-flight matches and went on to win three National League titles and the 1968 Challenge Cup as a coach of Hull FC and Leeds, was born in the town and played for Brynmawr RFC. A memorial to Francis was inaugurated in the town in October 2023.

<text>Benjamin Ashenafi Gordon (born April 4, 1983) is a British-American former professional basketball player. Gordon played for 11 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and he played college basketball for the University of Connecticut, where he won a national championship in 2004.

He is the only player to have ever won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award as a rookie. Gordon is fourth in career three-point field goals for the Chicago Bulls, behind Kirk Hinrich, Zach LaVine, and Coby White. He shares the NBA record for most three point field goals in a game without a miss (9) with Latrell Sprewell and Jalen Brunson.

==Early life==
Gordon was born in London, England, to a Jamaican father and an African-American mother. He moved to the United States as an infant, and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York. Gordon played high school basketball for the Mount Vernon Knights, and helped lead the team to the 2000 New York State Public and Federation Championships. Gordon was an All-State player at Mount Vernon and a top-40 national recruit. He was heavily recruited by Seton Hall, but decided to attend UConn.

==College career==
As a freshman at UConn, Gordon ranked second on the team in scoring (12.6 ppg), despite coming off the bench for most of the season. He hit the game-winning three-point shot against Villanova in the Big East tournament. As a Gordon averaged a team-leading 19.5 points (which ranked 50th in the nation) and also led the Huskies with 156 total assists, which earned Gordon Second Team All-Big East honors.

In Gordon&#x27;s junior and final year at UConn, he averaged a team-leading 20.5 points (again ranked 50th in the nation), 4.7 rebounds and 4.5 assists. He also connected on 104 three-pointers, the second-highest single-season total in UConn&#x27;s history. Gordon set a Big East Tournament record with 81 total points, earning the tournaments&#x27; Most Outstanding Performer honors. Gordon also earned the Most Outstanding Player award of the Phoenix Regional honors in the NCAA tournament. He also led the tournament field with 127 total points, as he helped lead the Huskies to the NCAA championship. Following his junior year, Gordon declared himself eligible for the 2004 NBA draft and was selected third overall by the Chicago Bulls, one pick after the Charlotte Bobcats drafted his UConn teammate, Emeka Okafor.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bulls (2004–2009)===

==== 2004–05 season: Sixth Man of the Year ====

Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon thought that he would be drafted anywhere from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. &quot;I&#x27;m a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I&#x27;d get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you.&quot; Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, &quot;I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn&#x27;t much I could do about it. So all I did was just [put together] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That&#x27;s why I wear No. 7.&quot; The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.

Between Michael Jordan&#x27;s departure in 1998 and Gordon&#x27;s arrival in 2004, the Bulls did not win more than 30 games in a single season. In his rookie year, Gordon helped lead a turnaround from a 3–14 start to finish 47–35 and secure the fourth seed in the playoffs. He averaged 15.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game while playing 24.2 minutes per game. Gordon also finished with 21 double-digit fourth-quarter-point performances, second to only LeBron James&#x27;s 22 in the NBA. In their first playoff appearance in the post-Jordan era, the Bulls (without Luol Deng) lost to the Washington Wizards in six games. After the season, Gordon became the first rookie in league history to be awarded the NBA Sixth Man Award. Gordon was also the NBA&#x27;s Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month 3 times (January through to March), and was also voted onto the NBA All-Rookie First Team.
Gordon also had problems with turnovers (4.46 per 48 minutes; sixth in the league in 2004–05), however, and an overall lack of stamina in his rookie season. He remarked, &quot;More than anything, I just want to come back [in the fall] in better shape. ... A lot of this game is about conditioning and how long you can give your best performance.&quot; Gordon also revealed that he was in the process of designing an energy drink called BG7, an allusion to his initials and jersey number. Gordon unveiled the drink at One Sixty Blue, a restaurant co-owned by Michael Jordan. The drink was made with white tea, which has a very high amount of antioxidants, and the most polyphenols of any tea.

==== 2005–06 season ====
In his sophomore campaign, Gordon alternated between the starting lineup and bench for the Bulls, starting 47 games (mostly in the later half of the season) while coming off of the bench for 35. The minutes Gordon played per game rose, as did his scoring and assist averages. Gordon was selected to play for the Sophomores in the Rookie Challenge held during the NBA All-Star Weekend, in which he scored 17 points.

On April 14, 2006, in a Bulls win over the Washington Wizards, Gordon tied Latrell Sprewell&#x27;s NBA record for the most three-pointers made in a game without a miss 9. The Bulls returned to the playoffs but were again eliminated in the first round in six games; this time they lost to the Miami Heat, who went on to win the NBA championship.

==== 2006–07 season ====
Gordon&#x27;s third season marked a giant step forward for himself and the Bulls. He adjusted to becoming the team&#x27;s starting shooting guard, averaging 21.4 points on near-46% shooting in 33 minutes per game. Chicago rebounded from a 3–9 start to finish 49–33. On March 4, 2007, Gordon established a career-high 48 points, leading a miraculous comeback effort to win 126–121 in overtime against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the first round of the playoffs the Bulls again faced the Heat, but this time won the series in four games, becoming the first team in NBA history to sweep the defending champions in the first round. They lost to the Detroit Pistons in the second round, but were able to force the series to six games after initially falling behind 3–0.

==== 2007–08 season ====
On the heels of their first playoff series win in nearly a decade, the Bulls entered the 2007–08 season with high expectations. Prior to the season, Gordon and Deng both turned down offers for contract extensions, believing they could earn more in free agency. Following a 9–16 start, Scott Skiles was fired and the Bulls did not recover. The Bulls drafted Derrick Rose with their first overall pick in 2008, raising questions about how Gordon and Rose could coexist in Chicago&#x27;s backcourt (both were score-first guards).

==== 2008–09 season ====
On October 1, 2008, Gordon finally accepted a one-year qualifying offer of $6.4 million after being unable to secure the contract that he was hoping for. On December 27, 2008, Gordon passed Scottie Pippen as the Chicago Bulls&#x27; career leader in three-pointers made. As had been the case in his previous four seasons, the Bulls&#x27; season got off to a rocky start. However, Gordon and Rose developed chemistry playing with each other, and helped the Bulls finish the season on a 15–8 run to just qualify for the playoffs at 41–41.

Entering the playoffs as the seventh seed and matched with the defending champion Boston Celtics, critics and observers expected the Bulls to be swept. However, in a series that featured the scoring exploits of Gordon (42 points in game 2) and Ray Allen (51 points in game 6), seven overtime periods and five games decided by a single basket, the Bulls pushed the series to seven games before finally losing. Gordon led the Bulls in scoring for the season and playoffs, averaging 20.7 and 24.3 points, respectively.

===Detroit Pistons (2009–2012)===

In July 2009, Gordon signed a five-year deal with the Detroit Pistons worth between $55 million and $60 million. With the Pistons, Gordon continued his role as a sixth man off the bench. On January 9, 2010, Gordon scored the ten millionth point in NBA history. After the season, Gordon had surgery on his left ankle.

On March 22, 2012, Gordon again tied the NBA record for most three-point shots made without a miss with 9. He scored 45 points to help bring Detroit back from a 25-point deficit, though they still lost to the Denver Nuggets 116–115.

===Charlotte Bobcats (2012–2014)===
On June 26, 2012, Gordon and a future first-round pick were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in a deal that sent Corey Maggette to the Pistons.

On November 28, 2012, Gordon scored 20 points in the fourth quarter of an eventual 91–94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. The 20 points were the most in one quarter for any player in Bobcats history. He finished with 26 points on 7-of-11 shooting, making 7-of-10 from beyond the arc, to go with 5-of-5 free throws.

On March 2, 2014, he was waived by the Bobcats.

===Orlando Magic (2014–2015)===
On July 11, 2014, Gordon signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Orlando Magic. Gordon&#x27;s final NBA game was played on March 22, 2015, in a 100–119 loss to the Denver Nuggets. In his final game, Gordon played for 14 minutes and recorded 3 points, 1 rebound and 1 assist. On June 29, 2015, he was waived by the Magic.

===Golden State Warriors (2015)===
On September 28, 2015, Gordon signed with the Golden State Warriors. However, he was waived on October 14, after appearing in two preseason games.

===Texas Legends (2017)===
On January 24, 2017, Gordon was acquired by the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League.

==National team career==
On April 1, 2008, Gordon was named to the shortlist for the British national basketball team. Gordon is eligible for the team by virtue of his British birth and dual citizenship. In 2010, he said he hoped to represent Great Britain in the 2012 Olympics. However, Gordon missed the beginning of Great Britain&#x27;s June 2012 pre-Olympic training camp in Houston, Texas. He later said he could not commit to the team after being traded from Detroit to Charlotte.

On July 22, 2016, it was announced that Gordon would be selected for Great Britain&#x27;s 24-man preliminary roster for the EuroBasket 2017 qualifiers. Gordon made Great Britain&#x27;s 12-man roster for the EuroBasket 2017 qualifiers, and during the qualification games, he averaged 9.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.

Gordon previously represented the United States national team at the 2003 Pan American Games.

==Post-playing career==
On June 1, 2017, Gordon was arrested for pulling fire alarms at his Los Angeles apartment building.

In October 2017, Gordon was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation after an altercation with a female patron at a holistic wellness center in Mount Vernon, New York.

On November 20, 2017, Gordon was arrested again for punching a manager of an apartment complex, pulling a knife on him and robbing him of his security deposit. He was ticketed, released on a $50,000 bail and had to appear in court.

In February 2020, Gordon revealed he was suffering from bipolar disorder, and detailed his battles with mental illness since retirement in an article about mental health for The Players&#x27; Tribune, including a suicide attempt.

On October 10, 2022, Gordon was arrested for allegedly punching his son at LaGuardia Airport in New York and subsequently resisting arrest. Gordon&#x27;s son had an order of protection since 2018, legally barring his father from taking him outside of Illinois and &quot;committing physical abuse, harassment, or the interference with personal liberty&quot;. Shortly afterwards, in early December, he was arrested and sent to Harlem hospital after attempting to stab several people with sewing needles.

On April 4, 2023, Gordon was arrested once again and taken into custody after he had, allegedly, threatened employees of a juice shop with a knife in Stamford, Connecticut.

On February 7, 2025, Gordon was inducted into the Huskies of Honor during halftime of the UConn game against St. John’s at Gampel Pavilion.

<text>The Symphony No. 6 in B minor, Op. 54 by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in 1939, and first performed in Leningrad on November 5, 1939 by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky.

==Structure==
Symphony No. 6 is in three movements and lasts approximately 30 minutes:

The Sixth Symphony is unusual in structure: a &#x27;regular&#x27; symphonic structure would contain a first movement in sonata form, a scherzo, a slow movement, and a quick finale, often also in sonata form. This symphony, however, begins with a long and introspective slow movement, followed by two short movements: a scherzo and a &quot;full-blooded and debauched music-hall galop&quot;.

According to music critic Herbert Glass, the &quot;entire [first] movement is based on the cell of a minor third, with a second theme - which follows without transition - the motif of a diminished seventh, with the trill at its close forming the third major ingredient of the movement - the two themes and the trill combined as a sort of super-theme. The composer lays this out as clearly as if he were teaching a music-appreciation class: do listen for it. Chamber music effects abound with, for instance, piccolo or flute, eerily alone or accompanied by the B-flat clarinets. There are walloping climaxes, too, each of which dies away into the gloom. Note, too, the composer&#x27;s wonderful spotlighting of the melancholy English horn, a lone figure after the din has evaporated.&quot;

The third movement galop is the movement Shostakovich himself thought was most successful. Music critic Daniel Hathaway noted that &quot;Snare drums ratcheted up the riot of brutal sound in the Scherzo and references to the William Tell Overture and laughing trombones added a hilarious burlesque quality to the finale.&quot; On average, the first movement is 15–20 minutes long, the second movement is 4–6 minutes long, and the third movement is 5–7 minutes long.

==Instrumentation==
This symphony is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets (3rd doubling Eb clarinet), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, harp, celesta and strings.

==History==
In September 1938, Shostakovich announced that he was sketching out his Sixth Symphony, which would be a large-scale &quot;Lenin Symphony&quot; for soloists, chorus, and orchestra that would utilize the poem &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&quot; by Vladimir Mayakovsky. Shostakovich reported that the declamatory quality of the poem was challenging to set and that he was unsatisfied with the work he had done so far on the symphony. He later tried to incorporate other literature about Lenin in his new symphony, but without success. Speaking in a later radio address in January 1939, he announced that he was &quot;getting ready to write&quot; the Sixth Symphony, but made no mention of Lenin or Mayakovsky’s poem.

The purely instrumental Symphony No. 6 was completed in September 1939. Shostakovich commented on it in the press:

The musical character of the Sixth Symphony will differ from the mood and emotional tone of the Fifth Symphony, in which moments of tragedy and tension were characteristic. In my latest symphony, music of a contemplative and lyrical order predominates. I wanted to convey in it the moods of spring, joy, youth.

On 5 November 1939, the premiere of the Symphony No. 6 took place in the Large Hall of the Leningrad Philharmonic in Leningrad by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky. The concert was part of a 10-day festival of Soviet music that included performances of Sergei Prokofiev’s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, Yuri Shaporin’s &quot;On the Field of Kulikovo&quot;, and Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony. On the same programme was the &quot;Romantic Poem&quot; for violin and orchestra by Valery Zhelobinsky. According to Isaak Glikman, the symphony had a successful premiere and the finale was encored. lauded the symphony in his review, predicting a bright future for it, and praising Shostakovich for his continued progress away from formalistic tendencies. Other critics remarked negatively upon what they considered was the symphony’s lopsided structure and its juxtaposition of moods.

The first recording was made by Leopold Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra for RCA Victor in December 1940.

<text>The Maytag Corporation is an American home and commercial appliance company. The company has been owned by Whirlpool Corporation since April 2006.

==History==


The Maytag Washing Machine Company was founded in 1893 by businessman Frederick Maytag. In 1925, Maytag Washing Machine Company became Maytag, Inc. Frederick&#x27;s son Elmer Henry Maytag took over as president of the company from 1926 until his own death in 1940. In the early 1930s, photographer Theodor Horydczak took pictures of the plant and some of its workers. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the company was one of the few to make a profit. In 1938, Maytag provoked strikes by the company&#x27;s workers because of a 10% pay cut. The company was able to beat the strike because of the intervention of four military companies, including a machine gun company, of the 113th Cavalry Regiment, Iowa National Guard. At his father&#x27;s death in 1940, Fred Maytag II, grandson of the founder, took over the presidency. During World War II, the company participated in war production by making special components for military equipment. In 1946, production of washing machines was resumed; in 1949, the first automatic washers were produced in a new, dedicated factory. In 1946, Maytag began marketing a separate line of ranges and refrigerators made by other companies under the Maytag name. During the Korean War, the company again produced parts for military equipment, although washing-machine production continued.

During the 1950s, the &#x27;white goods,&#x27; or laundry and kitchen appliance industry, grew rapidly. Maytag first entered the commercial laundry field at this time, manufacturing washers and dryers for commercial self-service laundries and commercial operators. In response, other full-line appliance producers began to compete with Maytag in the white-goods consumer market. These included &#x27;full-line&#x27; manufacturers such as Whirlpool, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Frigidaire, who built not only washing machines and dryers, but also refrigerators, stoves, and other appliances. Since Maytag was much smaller than the full-line producers, the company decided to limit itself to the manufacture of washers and dryers, alongside marketing ovens and refrigerators built by other companies, as a small, premium-brand manufacturer. The company capitalized on its reputation by renaming its corporate address in Newton, Iowa, &quot;One Dependability Square&quot;.

By 1960, Maytag had ceased marketing ovens and refrigerators, but later started again to expand into kitchen appliances with its own design of portable kitchen dishwasher and a line of food-waste disposers. Upon the death in 1962 of Fred Maytag II, the last family member involved in the company&#x27;s management, E. G. Higdon was named president of the company, with George M. Umbreit becoming chairman and CEO. By the late 1970s, over 70 percent of U.S. households were equipped with washers and dryers, and with approximately 18,000 employees worldwide, the company was established as a dominant manufacturer of large laundry appliances. After the company&#x27;s acquisition of Magic Chef, Inc., in 1986, a move which nearly doubled its size, the company acquired a new corporate name, Maytag Corporation.

In 1988, Maytag acquired Chicago Pacific Corporation, which was formed using the remnants of the bankrupt Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad. Chicago Pacific Corporation owned Hoover US and Hoover UK as well as Thomasville Brand Furniture. Maytag quickly sold off the Thomasville Furniture brand. Maytag Corporation, led by Chairman Daniel Krumm, next planned to make Maytag a worldwide organization.
The UK part of Hoover was to help Maytag expand into Europe. Hoover UK was not doing well financially and offered customers a round-trip ticket anywhere if they purchased a vacuum. This campaign cost the corporation $50 million to settle. Subsequently, Maytag sold off Hoover UK. This was a huge setback for the amount of cash Maytag had in hand and thus started the downward spiral financially.

In 1991 Maytag built a new plant in Jackson, Tennessee, for the manufacture of newly designed plastic tub dishwashers. The Plastic tub was developed in Newton, Iowa, but in 1996 Engineering was transferred to Jackson because Mr. Len Hadley, then president of Maytag Corporation, wanted the plant to be self-sufficient. This engineering team engineered a Stainless Steel dishwasher, Tall-Tub Plastic and Tall-Tub Stainless steel product. Engineering crescendoed with a Double Drawer dishwasher which today is manufactured in Findlay Ohio at the Whirlpool Plant, the only Maytag legacy product built in the Whirlpool Appliance line-up. The Jackson plant evolved into a streamlined manufacturing facility that could build thousands of dishwashers daily on multiple lines. This plant was the most efficient plant and was a hallmark for other facilities. Whirlpool closed this plant in 2009.

In 1997, Maytag Corporation purchased G.S. Blodgett Corporation, a maker of commercial ovens. At the time of this purchase Maytag was looking at the Turbo Chef line they had been working on up to this point.

Prior to 1997, the Maytag engineering team, at Maytag Laundry Appliances Research and Development, developed the Maytag &quot;Neptune&quot; line of front-load washers. 
A matching dryer was introduced to accompany the new washer. The company claimed that the new &quot;Neptune&quot; model saved energy costs over traditional washer/dryer sets. Production of the &quot;Neptune&quot; line was later switched to Samsung Electronics. 
In 2001, the company acquired the Amana Corporation and its appliance assembly facilities. That same year, Ralph F. Hake became the last chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Maytag Corporation, serving in that post until March 2006. Once renowned as the standard for laundry appliances, by 2003 the company faced increasing competition from new appliance brands in the US market, as well as from existing appliance manufacturers who had outsourced production a decade earlier in order to reduce costs. 
While Maytag had begun the process of shifting appliance production to lower-cost assembly plants outside the United States, in 2004, the company was still producing eighty-eight percent of its products in older U.S.-based factories. 
In an apparent move away from traditional company marketing strategy, company management decided on a plan to stimulate consumer purchases of new Maytag appliances before their old ones had worn out.

Costs incurred in Maytag&#x27;s acquisition and integration of Amana and an increased corporate debt load led to aggressive internal cost-cutting efforts in direct materials, manufacturing, and distribution costs. 
Maytag introduced a value-priced appliance line under a separate label, &quot;Performa by Maytag&quot;. To increase sales, the company also marketed Maytag-branded &#x27;Legacy Series&#x27; washing machines that were otherwise identical to low-end Amana models, and built at the formerly Amana assembly plant in Searcy, Arkansas. The rebranded Maytag models, later termed &quot;Amanatags&quot; by dissatisfied owners, received poor customer reviews after reports surfaced of major mechanical and/or durability problems. 
The company also consolidated warehouse operations and cut the number of Maytag vendors. Between 2002 and 2004, Maytag corporate management cut new-product investment by 50%.

An increasing chorus of consumer complaints concerning product reliability and customer service, assisted by the rapid growth of internet consumer forums, began to affect the company&#x27;s reputation with customers. 
The company was also slow to react to customer complaints regarding its flagship &quot;Neptune&quot; washer and dryer line (labeled the &quot;Stinkomatic&quot; by dissatisfied customers because they would become moldy in a way that could not be easily cleaned), resulting in further damage to the company&#x27;s reputation and a $33.5 million payout to settle several class-action lawsuits arising from the Neptune problems. 
By 2005, Maytag&#x27;s market share had declined to all-time lows, sales were flat, and customer satisfaction surveys ranked Maytag near the bottom of the appliance field. The problems with the &quot;Neptune&quot; line continued; in 2007, 250,000 &quot;Neptune&quot; washing machines became part of a nationwide safety recall by the Consumer Product Safety Commission due to fire danger.

In 2005, Haier sought to expand its share of foreign markets by acquiring rival white-goods OEMs and by expanding overseas production capacity. With backing from two large U.S. private equity funds, Haier made a bid to acquire U.S. appliance maker Maytag for $1.28 billion. The bid failed and Maytag was bought by Whirlpool for $1.7 billion.

On April 1, 2006, Whirlpool completed its acquisition of Maytag Corporation. In May 2006, Whirlpool announced plans to close the former Maytag headquarters office in Newton, as well as laundry product manufacturing plants in Newton, Iowa; Herrin, Illinois; and Searcy, Arkansas by 2007. Following the Maytag headquarters closure, all brand administration was transferred to Whirlpool&#x27;s headquarters in Benton Harbor, Michigan. The Maytag name would now be used on Whirlpool-designed appliances. Most Maytag employees were terminated, but some were offered jobs at Whirlpool. The board of directors of Maytag all received five years&#x27; severance pay. Former Maytag chairman and CEO, Ralph F. Hake, received two years&#x27; base salary and two years&#x27; target bonus under his severance agreement.

On January 1, 2009, Maytag (under the ownership of the Whirlpool Corp.) changed the vested lifetime benefits of the Maytag retirees. There is a lawsuit pending in the Southern District Court of Iowa where Whirlpool has asked for permission to change the UAW bargained benefits. The benefits in question were subsequently changed despite any resolution of the lawsuit.

==Products==
In major appliances, Maytag was among the top three companies in the North American market, offering a full line of washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, cooktops, refrigerators, and ranges under the Maytag, JennAir, Amana, and Magic Chef brands. Maytag also used to manufacture the top load laundry for Crosley until Maytag&#x27;s merger with Whirlpool.

Maytag sold multiple small appliances including a cordless iron under the Maytag brand, a mixer and blender under JennAir, the company also sold the popular Skybox and Rookie home-vending products.

In floor care, Maytag owned the Hoover brand, the market leader in North America and the floor-care brand with the highest consumer recognition and buying preference.

In commercial products, Maytag owned Dixie-Narco, a leader in refrigerated soft drink and specialty vending machines as well as Jade cooking products and Amana commercial cooking products.

Maytag had presence in markets around the world, including sales operations in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia. The corporation&#x27;s export sales and marketing, licensing of brands, and international joint ventures was coordinated by Maytag International in Schaumburg, Illinois.

Today, in the Whirlpool lineup, Maytag is mostly positioned as a mid-tier brand, generally priced somewhat above Whirlpool but below KitchenAid.

==Maytag International==

In 1988, DOMICOR was established as Maytag Corporation&#x27;s international division and in 1992 became Maytag International, Inc. which eventually encompassed all of Maytag&#x27;s worldwide ventures including Maytag Australia, Maytag Japan, Maytag Commercial (Mexico), and Maytag UK.

Maytag International, was based in Schaumburg, Illinois, handled the sales, licensing and business ventures of corporate appliances and floorcare brands in overseas markets as well as the administrative support for the international sales organization. This network extended to more than 70 countries worldwide.

Maytag International was responsible for export sales and licensing of the corporation&#x27;s appliances and floor care brands and joint ventures in overseas markets. This network extends to more than 90 countries worldwide. The main office is located in Chicago with major subsidiary offices in Burlington, Ontario (Canada), Monterrey (Mexico), Sydney (Australia), and London (England) and region sales offices in Beirut (Lebanon) and Yokohama (Japan).

==Manufacturing plants==
As of 2008, Maytag, by this time a division of Whirlpool Corporation, had 14 manufacturing plants throughout the United States and Mexico. These included:
* laundry manufacturing plants in the U.S.: in Newton, Iowa; Herrin, Illinois; and Searcy, Arkansas; and in Mexico: Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua.
* refrigeration manufacturing plants in Amana, Iowa (built by Amana Corporation, which was later acquired by Maytag) and Reynosa, Tamaulipas
* cooking manufacturing plant in Cleveland, Tennessee (former Magic Chef/Hardwick plant)
* dishwashing manufacturing plant in Jackson, Tennessee
* vending manufacturing plant in Williston, South Carolina
* Floor care manufacturing plant in Canton, Ohio
* subassembly manufacturing plant in Reynosa, Tamaulipas

Over the following years, Whirlpool closed Maytag plants in Newton, Iowa; Herrin, Illinois; Searcy, Arkansas; and Jackson, Tennessee. The Hoover floor care plant in Canton, Ohio was sold to Techtronic Industries, and its Dixie-Narco vending machine plant in Williston, South Carolina was acquired by Crane Merchandising Systems. (Techtronic and Crane acquired the plants when they acquired the Hoover and Dixie-Narco brands, respectively).

The remaining Maytag plants in operation today are in Cleveland, Tennessee and Amana, Iowa.*
*Whirlpool has since created a new plant in Cleveland. While holding on to a Maytag legacy workforce, the legacy buildings are no longer in use.

==Ol&#x27; Lonely==
Ol&#x27; Lonely, or &quot;the lonely repairman&quot;, is a character in Maytag advertisements, created for Maytag by copywriter Vincent R. Vassolo of the Leo Burnett advertising agency. His character was initially played by Jesse White, who retained the role until 1988. In a time in which the laundry appliances of major manufacturers had reached maturity, differing mostly in minor details, the campaign was designed to remind consumers of the perceived added value in Maytag products derived from the brand&#x27;s reputation for dependability. Maytag advertisements stated “Ol&#x27; Lonely’s predicament is testimony to the durability and reliability of Maytag appliances. Now if only he had something to do with his days.” Other ads stated, &quot;Not all Maytag repairmen are this lonely, but we&#x27;re trying.&quot; The campaign proved a huge success, allowing Maytag to set a substantial price premium, as well as strongly influencing consumer preference at the higher end of the laundry appliance market.

In 1986, the repairman was joined by Newton, a basset hound named for Maytag’s headquarters in Newton, Iowa. In 1989, character actor Gordon Jump first appeared as Ol&#x27; Lonely in the advertisement &quot;Biker&quot;. In total, Jump appeared in more than 77 Maytag commercials and print advertisements. He made appearances at events for employees and customers and also was actively involved in several philanthropic and charitable causes.

Actor Hardy Rawls was hired to play Ol&#x27; Lonely after Jump&#x27;s retirement in 2003, although he appeared only in print advertising and personal appearances. Gordon Jump died two months later on September 22, 2003. In French-speaking Quebec, Ol&#x27; Lonely was played by Paul Berval. For a period of time Maytag gave Ol&#x27; Lonely a younger sidekick character known as the &quot;Maytag Apprentice&quot;, played by actor Mark Devine. However, in 2005 Maytag cancelled his contract. Maytag also elected not to renew Rawls&#x27; contract, instead holding open auditions. Indianapolis Colts backup quarterback Jim Sorgi was among those who auditioned. On April 2, 2007, Maytag announced that Clay Earl Jackson of Richmond, Virginia had been selected to fill the role of Ol&#x27; Lonely.

By the end of the twentieth century, the &quot;Maytag repairman&quot; character had become an iconic metaphor for a professional whose services are rarely needed. Times were changing however, and events at Maytag and within the industry began to diminish the effectiveness of the long-lived Maytag-repairman campaign. Consumer demand for innovative, expensive, and increasingly complex electronically controlled and computerized appliances, coupled with higher labor costs and complaints over Maytag product quality and service, influenced a decline in Maytag sales and profit margins. By 2004, the Maytag repairman character had become to some consumers a symbol of misplaced trust in aging marketing campaigns. As one commentator noted, &quot;Unfortunately things change, and, after some major quality hiccups, now it&#x27;s the Maytag salesman who is bemoaning his loneliness. Maytag&#x27;s reputation has plunged to the bottom with costly consumer class action lawsuits and numerous quality complaints.&quot; As a partial result of Maytag&#x27;s quality problems, the company reported a loss of $9 million in 2004, according to &quot;Industry Week&quot;.

In January 2014, Maytag announced a &quot;Generation Five&quot; of the Maytag Repairman, currently played by Colin Ferguson. But instead of commercials showing the repairman waiting around his shop for a Maytag appliance to break, he is playing the part of the actual appliance.

<text>A stove or range is a device that generates heat inside or on top of the device, for -local heating or cooking. Stoves can be powered with many fuels, such as natural gas, electricity, gasoline, wood, and coal.

Due to concerns about air pollution, efforts have been made to improve stove design. Pellet stoves are a type of clean-burning stove. Air-tight stoves are another type that burn the wood more completely and therefore, reduce the amount of the combustion by-products. Another method of reducing air pollution is through the addition of a device to clean the exhaust gas, for example, a filter or afterburner.

Research and development on safer and less emission releasing stoves is continuously evolving.

== Etymology ==

Old English had a word &quot;stofa&quot;, meaning a hot-air bath or sweating room. However, this usage did not survive, and the word was taken newly from Middle Low German or Middle Dutch in the 15th or 16th century, later meaning any room heated with a furnace. By the 17th century it had come to mean a heated box such as an oven, and by the 18th century could mean an open fireplace.

== History ==

=== Versions prior ===

Cooking was performed over an open fire since nearly two million years ago. It is uncertain how fires were started at these times; some hypotheses include the removal of burning branches from wildfires, spark generation through hitting rocks, or accidental lighting through the chipping of stone tools. During the Paleolithic era, approximately 200,000 to 40,000 years ago, primitive hearths were constructed, with stones arranged in a circle shape. Human homes centered around these hearths for warmth and food. Open fires were quite effective; most fires are 30% efficient on average, and heat is distributed positively, with no heat being lost into the body of a stove. An estimated three million people still cook their food today over open fires.

Pottery and other cooking vessels were later placed on open fire; eventually, setting the vessel on a support, such as a base of three stones, resulted in a stove. The three-stone stove is still widely used around the world. In some areas it developed into a U-shaped dried mud or brick enclosure with the opening in the front for fuel and air, sometimes with a second smaller hole at the rear.

=== Early designs ===

The earliest recorded stove was created in Alsace, France in 1490. It was entirely made out of brick and tile, including the flue pipe. In similar times, the Ancient Egyptian, Jewish and Roman people used stone and brick ovens, fueled with wood, in order to make bread and other culinary staples. These designs did not differ extremely from modern-day pizza ovens. Later Scandinavian stoves featured a long, hollow iron chimney with iron baffles constructed to extend the passage of the leaving gases and extract maximum heat. Russian versions are still frequently used today in northern nations, as they hold six thick-walled stone flues. This design is frequently positioned at the intersection of internal partition walls, with a piece of the stove and flue inside each of four rooms; a fire is kept until the stove and flues are hot, at which point the fire is extinguished and the flues are closed, storing the heat. During Colonial America, beehive-shaped brick ovens were used to bake cakes and other pastries. Temperature control was closely managed by burning the appropriate quantity of wood to ash and then testing by inserting hands inside, adding additional wood, or opening the door to allow cooling.

===Ceramic===

Clay ovens have been used for millennia for cooking.
Masonry heaters were developed from Neolithic times to control air flow in stoves. A masonry heater is designed to allow complete combustion by burning fuels at full-temperature with no restriction of air inflow. Due to its large thermal mass the captured heat is radiated over long periods of time without the need of constant firing, and the surface temperature is generally not dangerous to touch.

=== Cast-iron ===

In 1642, at Lynn, Massachusetts, the first cast-iron stove was constructed. This stove was little more than a cast-iron box with no grates.

Benjamin Franklin designed the &quot;Pennsylvania fireplace&quot;, now known as the Franklin stove in 1742, which incorporated the fundamental concepts of the heating stove. The Franklin stove used a grate to burn wood and had sliding doors to control the draught, or flow of air, through it. It had a labyrinthine path for hot exhaust gases to escape, thus allowing heat to enter the room instead of going up the chimney. Because of its compact size, the stove could be fitted to an existing fireplace or used free-standing in the middle of a room by connecting it to a chimney. Developed amid a wood shortage, it required one-quarter the quantity of fuel as a regular fireplace and could raise the room temperature more quickly. Throughout North America, the Franklin stove enjoyed widespread adoption, warming farmhouses, city residences, and frontier huts.

For cooking, Count Rumford created a cast iron oven around 1800, the Rumford roaster. This was built into a brick kitchen range. Isaac Orr of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, created the first circular cast-iron stoves with grates for cooking meals on them roughly five years later. The potbellied stove traces its origins to the early 1800s, inspired by the Franklin stove developed twenty years prior. Jordan A. Mott designed the base-burning stove for burning anthracite coal in 1833. In 1834, Philo Stewart created the Oberlin Stove, a small wood-burning cast-iron stove. It was a compact metal kitchen stove that was far more efficient than cooking in a fireplace due to its improved heating capacity and allowance for record cooking durations. It was a huge commercial success, with some 90,000 units sold in the next 30 years, because it could be formed into desired shapes and forms and could survive temperature fluctuations from hot to cold readily. These iron stoves evolved into specialized cooking machines with chimney flue pipes, oven openings, and water heating systems. The originally open holes into which the pots were hung were now covered with concentric iron rings on which the pots were placed. Depending on the size of the pot or the heat needed, one could remove the inner rings.

=== Usage of gas ===

The earliest reported use of gas for cooking, according to the Gas Museum in Leicester, England, was by a Moravian called Zachaus Winzler in 1802. However, the first commercially produced gas stove, invented by Englishman James Sharp, did not enter the market until 1834. By the end of the century, the stoves became popular because they were easier to control and required less maintenance than wood or coal stoves.

The switch to gas was prompted by concerns about air pollution, deforestation and climate change, causing the general public to reconsider the usage of coal and wood stoves. Under common-use conditions, indoor NO2 from gas stoves can quickly exceed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) 1-h exposure benchmarks in kitchen air. NO2 pollution has been shown to harm human health.

=== Electric stoves ===
Electric stoves became popular not long after the advent of home electricity. One early model was created by Thomas Ahearn, the owner of a Canadian electric company, whose marketing included a demonstration meal prepared entirely with electricity at Ottawa&#x27;s Windsor Hotel in 1892.

As central heating became the standard in the developed world, cooking became the primary function of stoves in the twentieth century. Iron cooking stoves that used wood, charcoal, or coal radiated too much heat, which made the kitchen unbearably hot in the summer. They were superseded in the twentieth century by steel ranges or ovens fueled by natural gas or electricity.

=== Induction ===
The first patents for induction stoves date from the early 1900s. Demonstration stoves were shown by the Frigidaire division of General Motors in the mid-1950s on a touring GM showcase in North America. The induction cooker was shown heating a pot of water with a newspaper placed between the stove and the pot, to demonstrate the convenience and safety. This unit, however, was never put into production.

Modern implementation in the US dates from the early 1970s, with work done at the Research &amp; Development Center of Westinghouse Electric Corporation at Churchill Borough, near Pittsburgh. That work was first put on public display at the 1971 National Association of Home Builders convention in Houston, Texas, as part of the Westinghouse Consumer Products Division display. The stand-alone single-burner range was named the Cool Top Induction Range. It used paralleled Delco Electronics transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25 kHz current.

Westinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&amp;D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).

Production took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to White Consolidated Industries Inc. Modern-day induction stoves are sold by many manufacturers, including General Electric, LG Corporation, Whirlpool Corporation, IKEA, and Samsung.

== Types ==

=== Purpose ===

==== Cooking ====

A kitchen stove, cooker, or cookstove is a kitchen appliance designed for the purpose of cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven underneath or to the side that is used for baking. Traditionally these have been fueled by wood; the earliest known example of such was the Castrol stove. More modern versions such as the popular Rayburn range offer a choice between using wood or gas.

==== Heating ====
Stoves are also used for heating purposes. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s invention in 1740 popularized the widespread usage of modern heating stoves and fireplaces. Today, wood stoves are commonly used for warming homes, and are credited for their cost-effectiveness compared to coal and gas, and connection to the practices of human ancestors.

=== Fuel ===

==== Wood-burning ====

A wood-burning stove (or wood burner or log burner in the UK) is a heating or cooking appliance capable of burning wood fuel and wood-derived biomass fuel, such as sawdust bricks. Generally the appliance consists of a solid metal (usually cast iron or steel) closed firebox, often lined by fire brick, and one or more air controls (which can be manually or automatically operated depending upon the stove). The first wood-burning stove was patented in Strasbourg in 1557, two centuries before the Industrial Revolution, which would make iron an inexpensive and common material, so such stoves were high end consumer items and only gradually spread in use. Wood-burning stoves are still commonly used today in less-developed countries.

==== Coal-burning ====
The most common stove for heating in the industrial world for almost a century and a half was the coal stove that burned coal. Coal stoves came in all sizes and shapes and different operating principles. Coal burns at a much higher temperature than wood, and coal stoves must be constructed to resist the high heat levels. A coal stove can burn either wood or coal, but a wood stove might not burn coal unless a grate is supplied. The grate may be removable or an &quot;extra&quot;.

This is because coal stoves are fitted with a grate so allowing part of the combustion air to be admitted below the fire. The proportion of air admitted above/below the fire depends on the type of coal. Brown coal and lignites evolve more combustible gases than say anthracite and so need more air above the fire. The ratio of air above/below the fire must be carefully adjusted to enable complete combustion.

Coal, particularly anthracite coal, became a popular option during the 1800s in the United States because it burned at a high heat while also producing little soot. By 1860, as much as 90% of United States homes used anthracite coal as a solution for the fuel crisis that the United States faced. One major issue with the use of coal burning stoves in the 1800s was limitations of storing the material over time. A division between the wealthy and poor in using coal stoves was that many poor families could not afford to store the volumes of coal needed to heat homes for long periods of time. Therefore, while wealthy families could store large amounts of coal in cellars, poorer families often had to purchase coal in smaller quantities. Therefore, difficulties surrounding the storage of coal helped push the use and development of gas stoves.

Anthracite stoves such as the Pither stove were gravity fed and could burn for days.

==== Gas ====
Gas stoves were first introduced by Moravian Zachaus Winzler in 1802. Today, according to the US Energy Information Administration, 35% of American households use gas stoves. They are chosen as they offer better temperature control, durability, low cost, and speed of heating. In June 2023, Stanford researchers found combustion from gas stoves can raise indoor levels of benzene, a potent carcinogen linked to a higher risk of blood cell cancers. Gas-powered stoves are criticized for environmental concerns with methane emission and the usage of natural gas, the danger of carbon monoxide release, and difficulty in cleaning. For example, a January 2022 Stanford-led study reveals that the methane leaking from gas-burning stoves has a climate impact comparable to the carbon dioxide emissions from about 500,000 gasoline-powered cars.

==== Electricity ====

Induction stoves were first patented in the early 1900s. These stoves are praised for their cost-effectiveness, ease of cleaning, options to control low heat, and stable base for many types and sizes of pots and other cooking tools. Critics note that abrasive cleaners can damage induction stoves, that gas has more traditional culinary associations, and that induction stoves are unable to operate during power outages. Unlike gas stoves, induction stoves have no detectable benzene emissions and any benzene emissions could then be attributed to cooking food rather than to the cooktop or fuel used.

==Efficiency==
Compared to simple open fires, which can have efficiency of less than 10%, enclosed stoves can offer greater efficiency and control. In free air, solid fuels burn at a temperature of only about , which is too low a temperature for perfect combustion reactions to occur, heat produced through convection is largely lost, smoke particles are evolved without being fully burned and the supply of combustion air cannot be readily controlled.

By enclosing the fire in a chamber and connecting it to a chimney, draft (draught) is generated pulling fresh air through the burning fuel. This causes the temperature of combustion to rise to a point () where efficient combustion is achieved, the enclosure allows the ingress of air to be regulated and losses by convection are almost eliminated. It also becomes possible, with ingenious design, to direct the flow of burned gasses inside the stove such that smoke particles are heated and destroyed.

Enclosing a fire also prevents air from being sucked from the room into the chimney. This can represent a significant loss of heat as an open fireplace can pull away many cubic meters of heated air per hour. Efficiency is generally regarded as the maximum heat output of a stove or fire, and is usually referred to by manufacturers as the difference between heat to the room and heat lost up the chimney.

An early improvement was the &quot;fire chamber&quot;: the fire was enclosed on three sides by masonry walls and covered by an iron plate. Only in 1735 did the first design that completely enclosed the fire appear: the &quot;Castrol stove&quot; of the French architect François de Cuvilliés was a masonry construction with several fireholes covered by perforated iron plates. It is also known as a &quot;stew stove&quot;. Near the end of the 18th century, the design was refined by hanging the pots in holes through the top iron plate, thus improving heat efficiency even more.

In 1743, Benjamin Franklin invented an all-metal fireplace with an attempt to improve the efficiency. It was still an open-faced fireplace, but improved on efficiency compared to old-fashioned fireplaces.

Some stoves use a catalytic converter, which causes combustion of the gas and smoke particles not previously burned. Other models use a design that includes firebox insulation, a large baffle to produce a longer, hotter gas flow path. Modern enclosed stoves are often built with a window to let out some light and to enable the user to view progress of the fire.

While enclosed stoves are &quot;typically&quot; more efficient and controllable than open fires, there are exceptions. The type of water-heating &quot;back boiler&quot; open fires commonly used in Ireland, for instance, can achieve more than 80% absolute efficiency.

==Modern designs==
As concerns about air pollution, deforestation, and climate change have increased, new efforts have been made to improve stove design. The largest strides have been made in innovations for biomass-burning stoves, such as the wood-burning stoves used in many of the world&#x27;s most populous countries. These new designs address the fundamental problem that wood and other biomass fires inefficiently consume large amounts of fuel to produce relatively small amounts of heat, while producing fumes that cause significant indoor and environmental pollutants. The World Health Organization has documented the significant number of deaths caused by smoke from home fires. Increases in efficiency allow users of stoves to spend less time gathering wood or other fuels, suffer less emphysema and other lung diseases prevalent in smoke-filled homes, while reducing deforestation and air pollution.

Corn and pellet stoves and furnaces are a type of biofuel stove. The shelled dry kernel of corn, also called a corn pellet, creates as much heat as a wood pellet, but generates more ash. &quot;Corn pellet stoves and wood pellet stoves look the same from the outside. Since they are highly efficient, they don&#x27;t need a chimney; instead, they can be vented outdoors by a four-inch (102 mm) pipe through an outside wall and so can be located in any room in the home.&quot;

A pellet stove is a type of clean-burning stove that uses small, biological fuel pellets which are renewable and very clean-burning. Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material — typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are more than half a million homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, and probably a similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a feed screw to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an electric blower. The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the heat output.

Other efficient stoves are based on Top Lit updraft (T-LUD) or wood gas or smoke burner stove, a principle applied and made popular by Dr. Thomas Reed, which use small pieces of sticks, chips of wood or shavings, leaves, etc., as fuel. The efficiency is very high — up to 50 percent — as compared to traditional stoves that are 5 to 15 percent efficient on average.

Stoves fueled by alcohol, such as ethanol, offer another modern, clean-burning stove option. Ethanol-fueled stoves have been made popular through the work of Project Gaia in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.

===Airtightness===

An air-tight stove is a wood-burning stove designed to burn solid fuel, traditionally wood, in a controlled fashion so as to provide for efficient and controlled fuel use, and the benefits of stable heating or cooking temperatures. They are made of sheet metal, consisting of a drum-like combustion chamber with airflow openings that can be open and shut, and a chimney of a meter or more length.

These stoves are used most often to heat buildings in winter. Wood or other fuel is put into the stove, lit, and then air flow is regulated to control the burn. The intake airflow is either at the level where fuel is added, or below it. The exhaust (smoke) from the stove is usually several meters above the combustion chamber.

Most modern air-tight stoves feature a damper at the stove&#x27;s outlet that can be closed to force the exhaust through an after burner at the top of the stove, a heated chamber in which the combustion process continues. Some air-tight stoves feature a catalytic converter, a platinum grid placed at the stove outlet to burn remaining fuel that has not been combusted, as gases burn at a much lower temperature in the presence of platinum.

Using an air-tight stove initially requires leaving the damper and air vents open until a bed of coals has been formed. After that, the damper is closed and the air vent regulated to slow down the burning of the wood. A properly loaded and controlled air-tight stove will burn safely without further attention for eight hours, or longer.

These features provide a more complete combustion of wood and elimination of polluting combustion products. It also provides for regulation of the intensity of fire by limiting air flow, and for the fire to create a strong draught or draw up the chimney. This results in highly efficient fuel usage.

Air-tight stoves are a more sophisticated version of traditional wood-burning stoves.

==Emission regulation==

Many countries legislate to control emissions.
Since 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Phase III Woodstove Regulations in the United States requiring that all wood stoves being manufactured limit particulate emission to 4.5 grams per hour for stoves with after burners or 2.5 grams per hour for stoves with catalytic converters. Testing wood stove efficiency is limited to two primary methods, crib wood and cord wood. In 2020, wood stoves tested with crib wood must burn at= 2.0 grams per hour. As of 2020, efficiency tests can also be conducted with cordwood and must be below 2.5 grams of emission per hour. According to the EPA Cordwood discussion paper, these changes are aimed at improving current test methods in order to eventually develop an EPA reference method for cordwood stoves and, potentially, for central heaters (e.g., hydronic heaters/boilers and forced-air furnaces).

The burn temperature in modern stoves can increase to the point where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4 grams of emissions per hour. This is roughly 10% as much smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70%, as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace. Net efficiency is defined as the amount of heat energy transferred to the room compared to the amount contained in the wood, minus any amount central heating must work to compensate for airflow problems.

SB 1256, a bill that would ban the sale of disposable, single-use propane cylinders in California, is set to be presented for approval to Governor Gavin Newsom. If signed into law, the ban would take effect in January 2023 and would be the first of its kind in the United States. SB 1256 aims to phase out the cylinders completely by 2028; the state Assembly and Senate both approved the legislation. Propane stoves are widely used by campers for cooking, lighting, and heating, and the spent gas canisters often pile up on the ground near dumpsters at campgrounds. The bill is sponsored by the California Product Stewardship Council, a nonprofit local government coalition, in an effort to reduce waste and cut down on the pile-ups of canisters. Worthington Industries, a manufacturer of propane cylinders, has objected to the bill on the grounds that it would be disruptive to campers and that it would not improve the recycling rate of propane cylinders. The company has also argued that refillable cylinders cost three times as much as single-use cylinders.

==Research and development==
The search for safer, cleaner stoves remains to many an important if low-profile area of modern technology. Cook stoves in common use around the world, particularly in Third World countries, are considered fire hazards and worse: according to the World Health Organization, a million and a half people die each year from indoor smoke inhalation caused by faulty stoves. An engineer&#x27;s &quot;Stove Camp&quot; has been hosted annually since 1999 by Aprovecho Research Center (Oregon, US) with the intent of designing a cheap, efficient, and healthy cook stove for use around the world. Other engineering societies (see Envirofit International, Colorado, US) and philanthropic groups (see the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, California) continue to research and promote improved cook stove designs. A focus on research and development on improved heating stoves is ongoing and was on display at the 2013 Wood Stove Decathlon in Washington, D.C.

<text>Bernard Thévenet (; born 10 January 1948) is a retired professional cyclist. His sporting career began with ACBB Paris. He is a two-time winner of the Tour de France and known for ending the reign of five-time Tour champion Eddy Merckx, though both feats are tarnished by Thévenet&#x27;s later admission of steroids use during his career. He also won the Dauphiné Libéré in 1975 and 1976.

==Origins==

Thévenet was born to a farming family in Saône-et-Loire in Burgundy and lived in a hamlet called Le Guidon (The Handlebar). It was there in 1961 that he saw the Tour de France for the first time, on a 123 km stage from Nevers to Lyon. At the time Thévenet was a choirboy in the village church. He said: &quot;The priest brought forward the time for Mass so that we could watch the riders go by. The sun was shining on their toe-clips and the chrome on their forks. They were modern-day knights. I had already been dreaming of becoming a racing cyclist and that magical sight convinced me definitively. It was never that magical when I was actually in the peloton of the Tour!&quot;

From the age of six he went to school on the rack of his sister&#x27;s bike. He got his own bike a year later and pedalled the 10 km round journey himself. His first adult bike, not a racing machine but a sporty cross between a racer and a touring bike, came as a present for passing school examinations at 14. His parents needed him on the farm too much to be keen on his racing, but they knew their son&#x27;s ambitions. Thévenet rode his first race and his parents found out only when they read the local paper. There was a row and the club president intervened by inviting the parents to see their son&#x27;s next race. Thévenet won it.

He was champion of Burgundy in 1965 and 1966 and French junior champion in 1968. In 1967 the manager of the ACBB club in Boulogne-Billancourt Mickey Weigant, drove to his house to enrol him. The ACBB was an accepted development team for professionalism, particularly for the Peugeot team. During 1968, he rode for the amateur team of Jean de Gribaldy, &quot;Cafés Ravis-Wolhauser-de Gribaldy&quot;, which won the amateur Route de France. After that Thévenet did his military service in 1969.

==Professional career==
He turned professional with Peugeot-BP-Michelin in 1970. He rode the Tour de France for the first time in 1970, as a last-minute stand-in. He said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t even a reserve in 1970 but, because two riders in the team had fallen ill at Peugeot, the directeur sportif picked me two days before the start.&quot; Gaston Plaud had to call a neighbour in the village because neither Thévenet&#x27;s nor many other families had telephones. Thévenet had left to train with a friend, Michel Rameau, and his mother got a message to him at Rameau&#x27;s house.

Thévenet asked the advice of Victor Ferrari, a friend who rode the Tour in 1929. Thévenet said: &quot;He was probably afraid that I&#x27;d hesitate and he said: &#x27;You&#x27;re not going to say No, are you crazy? Go on, go...&#x27;&quot; Thévenet remembered:

:I can remember perfectly getting to Limoges [for the start]. I was anxious and scared at the same time, but full of pride. I was given a new suitcase, seven jerseys, six pairs of shorts, overclothes, sweaters, shirts and so on and so on. Everyone else had a brand new bike, but not me, because I wasn&#x27;t on the team&#x27;s entry list.

Thévenet won a mountain stage ending at the ski resort of La Mongie, most of the way up the Tourmalet in the Pyrenees. He said: &quot;That evening, it was all clear [&quot;j&#x27;ai compris bien des choses&quot;]. That I&#x27;d saved my season and, because of that, my job, because the obligatory two-year contracts for new professionals didn&#x27;t exist then.&quot;

In the 1972 Tour he crashed badly on a descent and was temporarily amnesic. As he began to regain his memory, he looked down at his own Peugeot jersey and wondered whether he might be a cyclist. On recognizing the team car, he exclaimed: &quot;I&#x27;m riding the Tour de France!&quot;

He refused to abandon the race and four days later won a stage over Mont Ventoux. In the 1973 Tour, he finished second, behind Luis Ocaña, but in 1974 he was forced to abandon the Tour on Stage 11 due to illness.

In the 1975 Tour, Thévenet attacked Eddy Merckx on the col d&#x27;Izoard on 14 July, France&#x27;s national day. Merckx, who was suffering stomach pain from a punch by a spectator, fought back but lost the lead and never regained it. Pierre Chany wrote:

:Those who were there will be slow to forget Bernard Thévenet&#x27;s six successive attacks in the never-ending climb of the col des Champs, Eddy Merckx&#x27;s immediate and superb response, the alarming chase by the Frenchman after a puncture delayed him on the descent of the col, the Belgian&#x27;s attack on the way to the summit of the Allos, his breath-taking plunge towards the Pra-Loup valley, his sudden weakening four kilometres from the top and, to finish, Thévenet&#x27;s furious push. The end of the race was frenetic. Has Eddy Merckx&#x27;s long reign in the Tour de France come to an end on the Pra-Loup. Some think so; others believe that it will happen tomorrow.

A British writer, Graeme Fife, wrote:

:Thévenet caught Merckx, by now almost delirious, 3km from the finish and rode by. The pictures show Merckx&#x27;s face torn with anguish, eyes hollow, body slumped, arms locked shut on the bars, shoulders a clenched ridge of exertion and distress. Thévenet, mouth gaping to gulp more oxygen, looks pretty well at the limit, too, but his effort is gaining; he&#x27;s out of the saddle, eyes fixed on the road. He said he could see that one side of the road had turned to liquid tar in the baking heat and Merckx was tyre-deep in it.

Beside the road, a woman in a bikini waved a sign that said: &quot;Merckx is beaten. The Bastille has fallen.&quot; Thévenet - who had taken the climb on the larger chainring - went on to win the Tour, which that year finished on the Champs-Élysées for the first time. Merckx finished second, three minutes behind.

Thévenet won his second and last Tour in 1977. That winter he was hospitalized with a liver ailment he attributed to long-term use of steroids. Several months later Thévenet lined up for the 1978 Tour de France but had to abandon the second mountain stage in an ambulance. He left the Peugeot cycling team after 1979 and signed for the Spanish team Teka, where he won two races and a six days race with the Australian rider Danny Clark.

He returned to a French team in his final year, 1981, where he won a stage in the Circuit de la Sarthe.

==Doping==
Thévenet said &quot;I have never taken drugs; they wouldn&#x27;t be any use.&quot; However, he was caught taking drugs, in the 1977 Paris–Nice.

His 1978 season was a shadow of his years of winning the Tour de France. He had trouble finishing even minor races. When a journalist at the radio station France Inter wondered aloud if Thévenet&#x27;s repeated poor performances might be due to doping, Thévenet and his team-mates refused to talk to the station.

Thévenet went to hospital, where tests showed serious trouble with his adrenal glands. He admitted taking steroids and called for an end to drugs in the sport. &quot;I was doped by cortisone for three years and there were many like me,&quot; he told Pierre Chany in &quot;Vélo-France&quot;. The steroids had been prescribed to him by François Bellocq, the Peugeot doctor, who had qualified only in 1976. Thévenet told Chany:

:We were all convinced we were doing the right thing [&quot;être dans le vrai&quot;] and we were certain we were a step ahead of the rest so far as what we were doing to prepare for competition. The young doctor with our team had taken the time to explain to us how the body reacted to effort, which nobody had done before him. His words convinced us of his competence, and maybe we were overconfident, but I had the feeling that he was taking us out of the continual experimentation [&quot;l&#x27;empirisme habituel&quot;] to get us on a more methodical and scientific road. From then on, everything that was said around us seemed to come from ignorance, jealousy or &quot;malveillance&quot;. I was at ease with myself, satisfied deep down that I was doing my job seriously. That was how it was from 1975 until just recently.

==Retirement==

Thévenet became directeur sportif in 1984 of the La Redoute team of Stephen Roche, then of RMO in 1986 and 1987. He became a television commentator and opened a company selling cycling clothes bearing his name. He was asked whether it was hard being a racing cyclist; his reply was that being a French farmer was harder.

Thévenet became race director of the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2010 after the organisation of the race was taken over by the Amaury Sport Organisation.

==Honour==
Thévenet was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur on 14 July 2001.

<text>San Cristóbal () is the capital city of the Venezuelan state of Táchira. It is located in a mountainous region of Western Venezuela. The city is situated above sea level in the northern Andes overlooking the Torbes River, from the Colombian border. San Cristóbal was founded on March 31, 1561, by Juan de Maldonado. From its inception, the city evolved rapidly as one of the most progressive and important centers of commerce in the country and the region, due primarily to its rich soil and its proximity to the border with Colombia. 
The city was severely damaged by the Earthquake of Cúcuta (also known as Earthquake of the Andes) in 1875. The city is located on the Pan-American Highway.

==Education==
San Cristobal has a large student population. There are many post-secondary schools, both public and private, in San Cristobal.

==Law and government==
San Cristóbal has one municipality: &quot;San Cristóbal Municipality&quot;, Venezuelan law specifies that municipal governments have four main functions: executive, legislative, comptroller, and planning. The executive function is managed by the mayor, who is in charge of representing the municipality&#x27;s administration. The legislative branch is represented by the Municipal Council, composed of seven councillors, charged with the deliberation of new decrees and local laws. The comptroller tasks are managed by the municipal comptroller&#x27;s office, which oversees accountancy. Finally, planning is represented by the Local Public Planning Council, which manages development projects for the municipality.

==Economy==
San Cristobal is the capital of the Tachira State. As throughout the Andean states, the people of Táchira are characterized as hardworking, cordial, conservative, and devoted to their historical, religious, and folkloric traditions. The primary industries here are centered around agriculture, mainly the production of coffee, sugar, and vegetables. Other important industrial sectors which have helped fuel the economic engines of the region include meat production (cattle), manufacturing industries like shoe, basket, and ceramics production. A fact that perhaps is not widely known is that it was in Táchira State, and not in Zulia State, that the first oil wells were excavated in 1875 (located in the Petrolea sector close to Rubio)-- a procedure done in those days by hand and with buckets. It is a commercial, transportation, and industrial center. Textiles, leather products, cement, and tobacco are produced, and coffee, sugar, pineapples, and corn are exported. The service sector is also strong. There are many branches of national banks located in the city, and it is the headquarters of an important financial institutions Sofitasa (bank of private investment). This bank is an important economic engine of the local economy because they help to finance many project in the region. In the dairy industry, Leche Táchira is one of the most consolidated industries in the country; this company is based in San Cristobal.

==Sports==
Deportivo Táchira Fútbol Club, usually known as Deportivo Táchira, is a football club located in San Cristóbal.

Another example is La Entrada Central, the only façade that&#x27;s left from the old Hospital Vargas. Among the most notable churches are La Iglesia El Angel, the Gothic styled church San José, and the El Santuario Church.

==Transportation==
There are three airports that serve Táchira State and its capital San Cristobal.

==Attractions and surroundings==
One of the most celebrated festivities which attracts visitors from all over is the Feria Internacional de San Sebastián held annually at Pueblo Nuevo next to Táchira state football club&#x27;s grounds. This fair, which occurs at the end of January, combines bullfighting festivities with a myriad of sport activities such as the Vuelta al Táchira, a bicycle race, artistic festivals, agricultural fairs, and many other spectacles. Nearby small businesses, in particular eateries, restaurants and small independent retailers thrive of the activities in Pueblo nuevo.

Places to visit in and around San Cristóbal include all the squares and parks around the city, the enchanting colonial town of San Pedro del Río and Peribeca. During Christmas these towns are full of decorations and mangers of every shape and size. Near the border with Colombia is the town of San Antonio de Táchira, with its lively commercial beat. Other interesting towns are Palmira and Abejales, above the town of Tariba, famous for their sugar cane baskets, and the town of El Topón, a typical agricultural town. The water fall of Chorro el Indio is an entertaining place to visit and be surrounded by nature.

Plaza de los Mangos, in Barrio Obrero, is a popular youth hangout close to San Cristobal&#x27;s city centre. A leafy square home to music shops, imported clothing retailers, Mini malls, nightclubs, eateries, ice-cream parlours, pool halls, Internet cafés, and small music venues, Plaza de los Mangos has become a busy hub for youth life. On a small offshoot road on the Plaza&#x27;s north-eastern corner, a small Virgin Mary figure is housed under a protruding old tree branch, a branch once used for public hangings; the date of the last hanging varies with who you ask.

<doc id="556368" wikidata="Q1579697" url="?curid=556368" title="Whernside">
<text>Whernside is a mountain in the Yorkshire Dales in Northern England. It is the highest of the Yorkshire Three Peaks, the other two being Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent. It is the highest point in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire and the historic West Riding of Yorkshire with the summit lying on the county boundary with Cumbria. It is the fifteenth most prominent hill in England.

In shape Whernside forms a long ridge, running roughly north-north-east to south-south-west. The mountain is north west of Ingleton and north of Horton-in-Ribblesdale.

== Name ==
The name, first recorded in 1208 as &quot;Querneside&quot;, is of Old English origin. It is derived from &quot;cweorn&quot; &#x27;quern&#x27; or &#x27;millstone&#x27; and &quot;sīde&quot; &#x27;hillside&#x27;, so means &quot;hillside where millstones are found&quot;. The name is of the same origin as Great Whernside, to the east, with which it is sometimes confused.

==Routes==
Whernside lies about northwest of Ribblehead Viaduct on the Settle–Carlisle Railway, and the mountain is commonly ascended from Ribblehead. There is a public footpath from Ribblehead that heads north via Smithy Hill and Grain Ings before turning west to Knoutberry Haw and then south to Whernside itself. From the summit the right of way heads initially south, then steeply south-east down a stepped path to the area known as Bruntscar. If climbed as part of the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge (which is normally done anti-clockwise) Whernside is climbed following the route up from Ribblehead to descend to Bruntscar.

There are, however, other routes up/down the mountain which are not rights of way but instead make use of open access land. A path heads directly west from the triangulation pillar to reach Deepdale Lane near White Shaw Moss. An alternative route heads directly north across Knoutberry Haw to pass Whernside Tarns and reaches the Craven Way at Boot of the Wold. Following the southern descent for , instead of turning steeply south-east towards Bruntscar a path continues south-west running adjacent to the wall passing Combe Scar and West Fell to reach the limestone pavements at Ewe&#x27;s Top.

Finally, south of the triangulation pillar an old route (partly fenced off) descends (initially very steeply) for to reach a road southwest of Winterscales Farm, this is the old route of the Three Peaks Challenge. Walkers should select this route with care as it is no longer maintained, boggy, badly eroded and requires extreme care over the steep ascent/descent. The current route of the Three Peaks fell race runs approximately north of this old ascent along open moor.

A walk solely around Whernside starting at the junction of the Blea Moor and Gauber roads near the Station Inn at Ribblehead, to the top of Whernside and back via the bridleway from Bruntscar via the farms at Broadrake, Ivescar, Winterscales and Gunnerfleet (or the footpath from Blea Moor Sidings) is a distance of roughly .

Alfred Wainwright in his 1970 &quot;Walks in Limestone Country&quot; describes three walks titled &quot;Ascent of Whernside&quot;: a route from Ingleton, up the southwest ridge and returning via Ellerbeck, which he describes as &quot;an exhilarating walk, a tonic for jaded minds, and a splendid exercise for the legs&quot;; a route from Dent (alternatively, from a car parked nearer), following what is now the Dales High Way route onto the ridge and descending steeply west to Deepdale, &quot;a fine walk on a fine day with excellent views ... the best of all routes up Whernside because of the lovely countryside from which it springs&quot;; and the ascent from Ribblehead, via Force Gill with a direct return via Winterscales.

On a clear day the views from the summit to the west can be spectacular, with views of the Lake District and Morecambe Bay, including (with the aid of binoculars) Blackpool Tower, some away.

<text>Superjoint, formerly known as Superjoint Ritual, was an American metal/hardcore band formed in the 1990s and fronted by Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo.

==History==
The band was formed by Phil Anselmo, Joe Fazzio, and Jimmy Bower in the early 1990s, later to be joined by Hank Williams III and Kevin Bond. They were founded by Anselmo parallel to his membership in Pantera, but became a full-time endeavor a few years later after Pantera&#x27;s dissolution.

Despite their early 1990s establishment, it was not until a decade later, after the folding of Pantera, that the group recorded any albums. It was then that Superjoint Ritual garnered significant TV exposure on programs such as MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and Fuse TV&#x27;s &quot;Uranium&quot;.

However, the group&#x27;s time in the spotlight would prove short lived. A dispute between Anselmo and Fazzio led to the band&#x27;s eventual split in late 2004, which was confirmed by both Hank Williams III and Jimmy Bower.

The band reunited at the Housecore Horror Film Festival in Austin, Texas, in October 2014. For unspecified legal reasons, the band performed under the name &quot;Superjoint&quot;. Hank Williams III was initially supposed to take part in this first reunion show, but had to bow out due to personal issues.

Although their appearance at Housecore Horror was supposed to be the only reunion show, the band would later perform at Hellfest 2015.

Superjoint released their latest album to date, &quot;Caught Up in the Gears of Application&quot;, on November 11, 2016, through Housecore Records.

In January 2017, Superjoint played a tour with Battlecross and Child Bite.

In an interview in June 2019, Anselmo mentioned that he was no longer interested in playing with Superjoint. In October 2020, bassist Stephen Taylor said he is unsure if the band is still active. Further interviews with guitarist Jimmy Bower in 2021 confirmed that the band is finished, with no plans to do any further work. Bower cited his and Anselmo&#x27;s disinterest in working on material related to the band, as well as their existing commitments to Eyehategod and Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals.

==Musical style and influences==
Superjoint&#x27;s style has been described as a mix of sludge metal and hardcore punk. Bands like Venom, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Voivod, and Darkthrone have also been noted as influences. The name &quot;Superjoint Ritual&quot; comes from a lyric in the Darkthrone song &quot;The Pagan Winter&quot;. According to Bower, Anselmo wrote 70–80% of the group&#x27;s music.

<text>Ingleborough () is the second-highest mountain in the Yorkshire Dales, England. It is one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks (the other two being Whernside and Pen-y-ghent), and is frequently climbed as part of the Three Peaks walk. A large part of Ingleborough is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and National Nature Reserve and is the home of a joint project, Wild Ingleborough, with aims to improve the landscape for wildlife and people.

==Name==
The first element of the name &quot;Ingleborough&quot; has been variably explained as a Scots term for &#x27;beacon, fire&#x27;, an Old Danish term meaning &#x27;English&#x27; or a derivative of Old English &quot;ing&quot;, &#x27;peak&#x27;. The second element is derived from the Old English word &quot;burh&quot;, meaning &quot;a fortified place&quot;; in this case, a hill fort. The summit plateau of Ingleborough is encircled by the remains of a massive stone rampart, containing the foundations of Iron Age huts.

==Geography==

Ingleborough is in the south-western corner of the Yorkshire Dales, at the highest point of a triangle of land with corners at Ingleton, Ribblehead and Settle. The hill is connected to its nearest higher neighbour, Whernside, by a low col or mountain pass at Ribblehead at approximately .

Ingleborough throws out a ridge to the north-east which develops into a summit, Simon Fell, and another summit further down, Park Fell. An ill-defined ridge going south-east from the summit breaks into two large areas of limestone plateau at about ; both plateaux contain summits and these are the subsidiary summits of Norber and Moughton. On the slopes of the former are the famed Norber Boulders. Continuing south-east the high land is broken by a divide carrying the minor road from Austwick to Helwith Bridge. On the other side of the divide the low summit of Smearsett Scar rises along with its subsidiaries, Pot Scar and Giggleswick Scar; from here the land falls away to the River Ribble at Settle.

On the western side of Ingleborough is a large limestone plateau appropriately known as White Scars. White Scar Caves run for below the plateau, and their entrance series has been developed as a show cave. The plateau is bounded by Raven Scar, the longest unbroken cliff in the district, and on top of it is the pothole of Meregill Hole. On the southern side (west of the Clapham path) is a similar plateau, containing potholes such as Fluted Hole and Pillar Hole.
The plateau to the north of Norber, an area known as The Allotment, is particularly rich in potholes; one of these, Long Kin East, can be followed without specialist caving equipment for . Also here is Juniper Gulf, which descends underground through an arduous rift, dominated by a small geological fault.

The Smearsett Scar region contains the Celtic Wall, the Ebbing and Flowing Well (which has now stopped ebbing and flowing) and a glacial hollow known as the Happy Valley.

==Ascents==
There are several popular hillwalking routes to its summit. The most frequently used starting point is probably the village of Ingleton, about to the southwest. An ascent from here is about there and back. The route follows a walled lane, Fell Lane, before emerging onto a flat area, Crina Bottom, scattered with potholes including the considerable Quaking Pot. A steep climb through the limestone cliffs leads to the summit.

The hill may also be climbed from Horton in Ribblesdale to the east, following a route crossing extensive areas of limestone pavement in the region of Sulber Nick. This is the route of descent of the Three Peaks Walk and has been heavily improved by the National Trust, having changed in just thirty years from no path at all to a serious example of footpath erosion. Another route on this flank is from the isolated farmstead of Crummack.

There is also a route from Clapham that follows the Ingleborough Estate nature trail, before passing the Craven Fault, the showcave of Ingleborough Cave, the ravine of Trow Gill and the pothole of Gaping Gill. It then crosses a marshy area and climbs up to the shoulder of Little Ingleborough before following the ridge to the summit. The return to Clapham can be varied by taking the Horton-in-Ribblesdale path for before striking south through more limestone pavement to the small top of Norber; a descent past the famed Norber erratics (Norber Boulders) finishes a walk of that Wainwright considered the finest walk in the Yorkshire Dales.

An alternative route from the south-west side of the triangle starts at Newby Cote, roughly a mile northwest of Clapham on the minor road heading towards Ingleton. This path proceeds ENE until it joins the main path from Clapham about a mile from the summit.

There is a northern route from the Hill Inn at Chapel-le-Dale, the route of ascent used by the Three Peaks Walk and the shortest way up the mountain, being just from village to summit. An interesting walk across a limestone plateau with many caves, including Great Douk Cave and Meregill Hole, is followed by a steep and tedious climb to the shoulder of the subsidiary summit of Simon Fell at , a mile to the north-east of the summit. The passage from here to the summit is high-level and exhilarating, but requires some scrambling.

Finally there are unwaymarked routes heading NE across Simon Fell and Souther Scales Fell both of which reach a steep descent just beyond the triangulation pillar on Park Fell to reach the Right of Way at New Close. Both routes give commanding views of the area.

==The summit==

The summit is a broad plateau half a mile in circumference, slightly convex, higher to the north-west than to the south-east, and carpeted with dry turf. There is an Ordnance Survey trig point (number S. 5619) at the highest point, near the western corner. Just to the north is a well-built windshelter (cross-shaped to provide shelter whichever way the wind is blowing) with a view indicator or toposcope built into its centre. Between them is a large cairn. At the point where the Ingleton path reaches the summit rim is an even larger cairn; this, remarkably, is the remains of a battlemented round tower (a hospice), built in 1830. The celebrations on the day of its opening ceremony became so alcoholic, however, that parts of it were thrown down there and then, the rest being destroyed later.

Along the northern and eastern edges of the plateau are the tumbled remains of a wall, once believed to have been a Roman military camp but now known to be an Iron Age hill fort. For the view, which is far-reaching and superb, see here. The hill fort, which covers and of which the defensive wall can still be seen although much robbed for stone, contains the remains of several hut circles. It is now thought that this was in fact Celtic, built by the Brigantes, the largest amalgamation of tribes in Iron Age Britain. The fort was known to the Romans as the Kings Fort. It may be that this was a base for Venutius after his &#x27;divorce&#x27; from Cartimandua, the Brigantes Queen who was a supporter of the Roman invaders, unlike Venutius who led several rebellions. What we do know is that this fort was used all year, which was unusual for such a location, but at the time of the Romans the climate was much milder, the Romans for example cultivating grapes in Newcastle.

==Geology==
The striking appearance of Ingleborough from all directions and from a great distance is due to the unusual geology of the underlying rock. The base of the mountain is composed of ancient Silurian and Ordovician rocks which are exposed in the valley bottoms to the north of Ingleton. A belt of Carboniferous Limestone, the &#x27;Great Scar Limestone&#x27;, some thick, lies on top of this. Due to the limestone&#x27;s permeability, all the streams flowing down from the mountain are engulfed upon reaching it, falling into a number of potholes. Above lies the layered Yoredale Series of sedimentary rocks, predominantly shale and sandstone, and generally concealed by the peat but revealed in the escarpments about up. There are also layers of harder limestone sandwiched between the softer rocks which have been eroded faster, and which protect the layers beneath them, leading to the &#x27;tiered&#x27; effect. The whole mountain, however, is protected from erosion by a cap of Millstone Grit approximately tall. The rock above the Millstone Grit layer has been eroded away, which explains the comparative flatness of the summit. A good explanation of the geology and scenery of the area is given in Waltham.

<text>Pen-y-ghent or Penyghent is a fell in the Yorkshire Dales, England. It is the lowest of Yorkshire&#x27;s Three Peaks at ; the other two being Ingleborough and Whernside. It lies east of Horton in Ribblesdale. It has a number of interesting geological features, such as Hunt Pot, and further down, Hull Pot. The waters that flow in have created an extensive cave system which rises at Brants Gill head.

In 2004 the body of Lamduan Armitage, dubbed by the media the &quot;Lady of the Hills&quot;, was found near to the entrance of Sell Gill Hole.

==Etymology==
In the Cumbric language, exactly as in today&#x27;s Welsh, &quot;pen&quot; meant &#x27;top&#x27; or &#x27;head&#x27;, and &quot;y&quot; is most likely the definite article (&quot;the&quot;), exactly as in Modern Welsh &quot;y&quot; (compare Pen-y-berth &#x27;end of the hedge/copse&#x27;, or Pen-y-ffordd &#x27;head of the road/way&#x27;, etc.). The element &quot;ghent&quot; is more obscure, it could be taken to be &#x27;edge&#x27; or &#x27;border&#x27;. The name &quot;Pen-y-ghent&quot; could therefore mean &#x27;Hill on the border&#x27; (compare Kent). Or else, the final element may be &quot;gïnt&quot;, meaning &quot;a heathen, a gentile&quot; (&lt; Latin &quot;gentis&quot;; c.f. Welsh &quot;gynt&quot;), presumably in reference to Scandinavian pagans.

It is also acceptable to write the name as &quot;Pen y Ghent&quot; rather than &quot;Pen-y-ghent&quot;.

==Geography==
Pen-y-Ghent is made up of a millstone grit top upon a bed of carboniferous limestone. The summit acts as a watershed with water flowing east into the River Skirfare and on through to the Humber Estuary, and water flowing west dropping into the River Ribble, to ultimately flow into the Irish Sea. The distinctive rakes that adorn the hillside (particularly on the western edge of Pen-y-Ghent) were revealed during a great storm in July 1881. The ferocity of the water cascading down the hillside removed the topsoil and revealed the rakes beneath.

Hull Pot Beck rises on the western side of Plover Hill and flows into Hull Pot, which is the largest natural hole in England. Hull Pot measures long by wide and deep. The water then flows under Horton Moor before re-appearing just east of Horton in Ribblesdale as Brants Ghyll Beck, where it flows into the River Ribble. The pot is a collapsed cavern and there is little to explore underground. In dry weather the beck takes an underground route before it gets to the rim. It resurfaces as a waterfall below in the pot itself. In very wet weather the stream runs over the edge into the pot, creating a spectacular waterfall. In extreme flood conditions the entire chasm can fill it to the brim, and overflow onto the hillside. The lower pitches of the cave are described as &quot;some of the most flood prone in the Dales and can only be descended in very low water levels. 

An 18th century a guide-book named it &quot;Hulpit&quot;, &#x27;and was described as &quot;like the inside of an enormous old Gothic castle, the high ruinous walls of which were left standing after the roof was fallen in&quot;. Local legend has it that the waters from Hull Pot and Hunt Pot cross each other underground without mixing. This is said to have first been noted when a sheep wash was undertaken in one stream thereby making it muddy, and the husks of oats being dropped into the other stream and both having exited into the Ribble without mixing together.

==Hiking==
The Pennine Way links the summit to the village; the route is around in length as the Way curves initially to the north before turning east to reach the summit. The more direct route that traverses the southern &#x27;nose&#x27; of the hill is the route usually taken by those attempting the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge, as the walk is usually (but not exclusively) done in an anti-clockwise direction starting and finishing in Horton in Ribblesdale. The other main hillwalking route on the hill heads north from the summit to reach Plover Hill before descending to join Foxup Road, a bridleway at the head of Littondale.

Pen-y-ghent is one of the mountains on the Yorkshire Three Peaks route.

<text>The alto saxophone is a member of the saxophone family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones were invented by Belgian instrument designer Adolphe Sax in the 1840s and patented in 1846. The alto saxophone is pitched in the key of E, smaller than the B tenor but larger than the B soprano. It is the most common saxophone and is used in popular music, concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, military bands, marching bands, pep bands, carnatic music, and jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, swing music). 

The alto saxophone had a prominent role in the development of jazz. Influential jazz musicians who made significant contributions include Don Redman, Jimmy Dorsey, Johnny Hodges, Benny Carter, Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, Lee Konitz, Jackie McLean, Phil Woods, Art Pepper, Paul Desmond, and Cannonball Adderley.

Although the role of the alto saxophone in orchestral music has been limited, influential performers include Marcel Mule, Sigurd Raschèr, Jean-Marie Londeix, Eugene Rousseau, and Frederick L. Hemke. 

== Range ==

As with most saxophones, the alto&#x27;s written range is B3 to F6 (or F6), with the higher altissimo register starting at F6 (or G6). The saxophone&#x27;s altissimo register is more difficult to control than that of other woodwinds and is usually only expected from advanced players. There is no well-defined upper limit for the altissimo register.

The alto saxophone is a transposing instrument, with pitches sounding a major sixth lower than written. In terms of concert pitches, the alto saxophone&#x27;s range is from concert D3 (the D below middle C—see Scientific pitch notation) to concert A5 (or A5 on altos with a high F key).

A few rare alto saxophones, like some Selmer Mark VI models, have been keyed to reach a low A, a semitone lower, similar to baritone saxophones.

== Alto saxophonists ==

Notable jazz alto saxophonists include Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, Johnny Hodges, Sonny Stitt, Paul Desmond, Benny Carter, Ornette Coleman, Lee Konitz, Bobby Watson, Eric Dolphy, Marshall Allen, Art Pepper, Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill, Carlos Ward, David Sanborn, Dave Koz, Tom Scott, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, John Zorn, Tim Berne, Steve Wilson, Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, Vincent Herring, Mark Gross, Kenny Garrett and Jeff Coffin.

Notable classical alto saxophonists include Tim McAllister, Jean-Yves Fourmeau, Lawrence Gwozdz, Donald Sinta, Harvey Pittel, Larry Teal, Kenneth Tse, Arno Bornkamp, Harry White, Otis Murphy, Claude Delangle.

Kadri Gopalnath was the pioneer of Carnatic music for the instrument. Rudresh Mahanthappa combines elements of jazz and Carnatic music for the alto saxophone.

== Manufacturers ==
Companies that currently produce saxophones include Buffet Crampon, KHS/Jupiter, Conn-Selmer, Selmer Paris, Yamaha, Leblanc/Vito, Keilwerth, Cannonball, and Yanagisawa. 

== Classical music repertoire ==

The alto saxophone has a large classical solo repertoire that includes solos with orchestra, piano, and wind symphony. Two important solo compositions are Jacques Ibert&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Concertino da Camera&quot; and Alexander Glazunov&#x27;s &quot;Concerto in E Flat major&quot;&quot;.

The alto saxophone is found in the standard instrumentation of concert bands and saxophone quartets. Alexander Glazunov composed his Saxophone Quartet in B-flat major in 1932.

The alto saxophone is sometimes used in orchestral music. Some of the compositions where it appears are listed below.

*Georges Bizet features it in the &quot;Intermezzo&quot; and &quot;Minuet&quot; from the second suite of music from &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne.&quot;

<doc id="556374" wikidata="Q2837729" url="?curid=556374" title="Allan Jones (actor)">
<text>Allan Jones (October 14, 1907 – June 27, 1992) was an American tenor and actor.

Jones is probably best remembered today as the male romantic lead actor in the first two films the Marx Brothers starred in for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935) and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937), as well as the film musicals &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Firefly&quot; (1937), where he introduced &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;, which became his signature song.

==Early years==
Jones was born in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, and raised in nearby Scranton, where he graduated from Central High School. His father and grandfather were Welsh coal miners, and he worked in coal mines early in his adult life. He left that occupation to study voice at New York University.

In an interview in 1973, Jones recalled that his father and grandfather were musically talented: &quot;My father had a beautiful tenor voice. So did my grandfather...Grandfather taught violin, voice, and piano when he could. My father sang every chance he could get and realized his ambition through me.&quot;

==Stage==
Jones appeared on Broadway a few times, including 1933&#x27;s &quot;Roberta&quot; and the short-lived 1934 revival of &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; after debuting in &quot;Boccacio&quot; in 1931.

==Film==

Jones starred in many film musicals during the 1930s and 1940s. The best-known of these were the original film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Firefly&quot; (1937) where he first performed what became his signature song: &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;. Jones is probably best remembered today as the romantic lead opposite Kitty Carlisle and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan respectively, in the Marx Brothers first two MGM films &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935) and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937), filling the straight-man role opened by the departure of Zeppo Marx from the team.

Jones made a brief appearance in the 1936 Nelson Eddy–Jeanette MacDonald film &quot;Rose Marie&quot;, singing music from Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Romeo et Juliette&quot; and Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;. According to &quot;Merchant of Dreams&quot;, Charles Higham&#x27;s biography of Louis B. Mayer, Eddy, who apparently considered Jones a rival and a potential threat, asked that most of the footage of Jones in &quot;Rose Marie&quot; be cut, including his rendition of the tenor aria &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; from &quot;Tosca&quot; and MGM agreed to Eddy&#x27;s demands. In his final film for MGM, &quot;Everybody Sing&quot; (1938) with Judy Garland and Fanny Brice, Jones introduced the pop standard &quot;The One I Love&quot;. &quot;My Love For Yours&quot; 1939. 

In 1940, Jones starred in two musicals for Universal Pictures: &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, with the stage score by Rodgers and Hart, and &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot; with a score by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields, which was also the screen debut of Abbott and Costello. After these two films, Jones slipped to leads in several &quot;B&quot; musicals, at Paramount and Universal, including a reunion with his &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; co-star Kitty Carlisle in &quot;Larceny with Music&quot; (1943). The same year, he made a guest appearance, as himself, in the Olsen and Johnson musical &quot;Crazy House&quot;, where he again performed &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;.

==Recordings==
Jones recorded prodigiously throughout his career, primarily for RCA Victor. His 1938 recording of &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot; ranks third among the all-time best-selling single records issued by RCA Victor.

==Radio==
In the mid-1940s, Jones and pianist Frankie Carle starred in the &quot;Old Gold Show&quot; on CBS radio.

==Later years==
In December 1980, Jones made his final screen appearance on an episode of the ABC-TV series, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, which also featured his son Jack Jones and Dorothy Lamour. 
During the 1980s, Jones appeared in several stage productions of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and &quot;Carousel&quot;. Jones continued to make concert appearances until a few months before his death in 1992.

Jones also bred and raised racehorses on his ranch in California.

==Personal life==
Jones was married four times. He was married to actress Irene Hervey from 1936 to 1957; their son was pop singer Jack Jones. His other wives included Marjorie Annette Bull, Esther Marie Villavincie, and Mary Florsheim (granddaughter of Milton S. Florsheim).

==Death==
Jones died of lung cancer at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City on June 27, 1992, aged 84.

<doc id="556375" wikidata="Q751162" url="?curid=556375" title="Repeating rifle">
<text>A repeating rifle is a single-barreled rifle capable of repeated discharges between each ammunition reload. This is typically achieved by having multiple cartridges stored in a magazine (within or attached to the rifle) and then fed individually into the chamber by a reciprocating bolt, via either a manual or automatic action mechanism, while the act of chambering the round typically also recocks the hammer/striker for the following shot. In common usage, the term &quot;repeating rifle&quot; most often refers specifically to manual repeating rifles (e.g. lever-action, pump-action, bolt-action, etc.), as opposed to self-loading rifles, which use the recoil, gas, or blowback of the previous shot to cycle the action and load the next round, even though all self-loading firearms are technically a subcategory of repeating firearms.

Repeating rifles were a significant advance over the preceding single-shot, breechloading rifles when used for military combat, as they allowed a much greater rate of fire. The repeating Henry rifle was used by the infantry and Spencer rifle was used by the cavalry during the American Civil War and the subsequent American Indian Wars, and the first repeating air rifle to see military service was the Windbüchse rifle.

It was also stated that the inventor was working on a gun capable of firing up to 30 times in a minute on more or less the same principles.
* The Belton flintlock was a repeating flintlock design using superposed loads, conceived by Joseph Belton of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania some time prior to 1777.

A rifle similar in type to this was also stated to be kept at the .
* Church and Bartemy/Bartholomew gun: A repeating rifle designed by the Americans William Church and Chrostus Bartemy or Bartholomew in 1813 with three separate magazines for containing up to 42 charges of ammunition and capable of firing 25 shots a minute. It could be reloaded in one minute.
* Thomson rifle: A flintlock repeating rifle patented in 1814, using multiple breeches to obtain repeating fire.
* Collier flintlock revolver (1814)
* Leroy rifle: In 1815 (sometimes incorrectly dated as 1825) a French inventor called Julien Leroy patented a flintlock and percussion revolving rifle with a mechanically indexed cylinder and a priming magazine.
* Lepage guns: In 1819 a French gunsmith called Lepage invented and presented at the French industrial exposition of that year percussion 2-shot and 4-shot turn-over rifles. In 1823 he exhibited a volley rifle that fired seven rifled barrels simultaneously as well as a turning carbine. In 1827, the same inventor exhibited at another French industrial exposition eleven percussion and one flintlock firearms which included a 4-shot revolving rifle, a &#x27;double rifle&#x27; with a cylinder with five charges and a &#x27;single rifle&#x27; and a pair of pistols also with a cylinder with five charges.

* Henry rifle: A French 14 shot flintlock rifle in the style of the Kalthoff and Lorenzoni rifles patented in 1831 (granted in 1835) by François-Antoine Henry, though possibly based on an earlier design published in 1809 by the same author.
* Silas Day magazine gun: A percussion revolving rifle to which was attached a loose-powder-and-ball magazine patented in the US in 1837.
* Colt ring lever rifles (1837)
* Bailey, Ripley and Smith magazine rifle: In 1838 the Americans Lebbeus Bailey, John B. Ripley and William B. Smith patented a percussion repeating rifle with a gravity-operated tubular magazine which could hold up to 15 re-useable steel cartridge-chambers.
* Eaton rifle: In 1838 a percussion rifle invented in America by James Eaton was described as being capable of holding 24 rounds in a rotating magazine and discharging them all in four minutes for a rate of fire of 6 rounds per minute.
* Kratsch rifle: In 1839 it was reported that a mechanic called Kratsch from Bayreuth had invented a rifle capable of firing 30 times in a minute and being reloaded in one minute.
* Devisme guns: In 1844 a French gunsmith known as Devisme presented a variety of repeating firearms for the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 including an 18 shot pistol with no visible hammer or lock, a 6 shot pistol, a rifle with 6 shots and a &#x27;revolving thunder&#x27; and a four shot &#x27;double acting&#x27; rifle.
* Jennings magazine rifle: in 1847 Walter Hunt patented in Britain a repeating rifle he called &quot;the Volitional Repeater&quot;. He would patent it again in the United States in 1849. This rifle featured a tubular magazine beneath the barrel and a lever mechanism to raise cartridges into the chamber. Unable to finance the building of the rifle, Hunt sold the rights to George Arrowsmith who in turn had an employee, Lewis Jennings, improve the lever mechanism. Courtland Palmer placed the first order for the &quot;Jennings Magazine rifle&quot; for his hardware store: Robbins &amp; Lawrence. The rifle did not sell well as the ammunition was a hollow based bullet containing gunpowder. Most of the guns were later converted to single shot rifles. Two employees working at Robbins &amp; Lawrence: Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson improved the design and sold it as the &quot;Smith-Jennings Repeating Rifle&quot;. At first they used a slightly modified Flobert cartridge, patented in 1853, but later they would switch to a modified Rocket Ball type of ammunition altered so as to function as a self-contained centerfire cartridge.
* Cass repeating belt gun: A percussion repeating rifle patented in 1848 in the US using a chain or belt in the stock which carried paper cartridges to the breech of the gun.
* Buchel cartridge magazine gun: The first tubular cartridge magazine gun to be patented in the United States in February 1849.
* Perry &#x27;faucet-breech&#x27; gun: A hinged or tilting breech repeating rifle patented in the US in December 1849 by Alonzo Perry using paper cartridges contained in several gravity-operated tubular magazines in the stock and a separate magazine for fulminate pills which were used for ignition.
* Porter self-loading gun: In February 1851 a loose-powder-and-ball percussion magazine gun invented by a Parry W. Porter, better known for the turret rifle he invented and to which the magazine for his loose-powder-and-ball gun was to be attached, was reported on in American newspapers and later in the same year a patent was procured by the inventor.
* Needham self-loading carbine: A self-loading carbine demonstrated in June 1851 at the Great Exhibition by Joseph Needham.
* Dixon self-loading and self-priming gun: A repeating gun demonstrated by a C. S. Dixon which won a silver award at the Annual Fair of the American Institute in October 1851.
* The first slide action patent: Issued in Britain in 1854, to Alexander Bain who modified the mechanism of a harmonica gun.
* 1854 Lindner revolving rifle: In 1854 the German Edward Lindner patented in the United States and Britain a repeating rifle which used a revolving cylinder to elevate the cartridges, which were paper and could be either self-contained needlefire cartridges or use external percussion caps for ignition, to the breech from a tubular magazine located under the barrel.
* Colette gravity pistol: A repeating saloon gun premiered at the 1855 World&#x27;s Fair. Despite popularly being known as the Colette gravity pistol, its original inventor was actually a Belgian called Jean Nicolas Herman.
* Colt revolving rifle (1855)
* Leroux magazine gun: At the Exposition Universelle (1855) in France a French gunsmith called Leroux demonstrated a repeating carbine with a magazine for 36 Flobert cartridges and which featured a novel cartridge extractor.
* Spencer repeating rifle (1860)
* Roper repeating shotgun (1882/1885)

== Mechanisms ==
=== Manual ===
==== Revolver action ====

While some early long guns were made using the revolver mechanism popular in handguns, these did not have longevity. Even though the revolver mechanism was fine for pistols, it posed a problem with long guns: without special sealing details, the cylinder produces a gas discharge close to the face when the weapon is fired from the shoulder, as was the common approach with rifles.

==== Falling block action ====
Although most falling-blocks were single-shot actions, some early repeaters used this design, notably the Norwegian Krag–Petersson and the U. S. Spencer rifle. The former loaded from a Henry-style underbarrel magazine; the latter fed from a tubular magazine in the buttstock.

==== Lever action ====

In a classic lever-action firearm of the Henry-Winchester type, rounds are individually loaded into a tubular magazine parallel to and below the barrel. A short bolt is held in place with an over center toggle action. Once closed, the over center action prevents opening solely by the force on the bolt when the weapon is fired. This toggle action is operated by a hand grip that forms part of the trigger guard. When operated, a spring in the tubular magazine pushes a fresh round into position. Returning the operating lever to the home position chambers the round and closes the breach. An interlock prevents firing unless the toggle is fully closed. The famous Model 1873 Winchester is exemplary of this type. Later lever-action designs, such as Marlin leverguns and those designed for Winchester by John Browning, use one or two vertical locking blocks instead of a toggle-link. There also exist lever-action rifles that feed from a box magazine, which allows them to use pointed bullets.

A one-off example of Lever action reloading on automatic firearms is the M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun. This weapon had a swinging lever beneath its barrel that was actuated by a gas bleed in the barrel, unlocking the breech to reload. This unique operation gave the nickname &quot;potato digger&quot; as the lever swung each time the weapon fired.

==== Pump action ====

With a pump-action firearm, the action is operated by a movable fore-end that the shooter moves backwards and forwards to eject a spent round, and extract and chamber a fresh round of ammunition. Pump-actions are usually associated with shotguns, but one example of a pump-action rifle is the Remington Model 7600 series. Rifles with pump action are also called slide-action. This style of rifle is still popular with some local law enforcement branches as a rifle that is easy to train officers who are already familiar with the pump shotgun.

==== Bolt action ====

The bolt is a mechanism that is operated by hand to extract a fired cartridge, move a fresh round into the chamber and reset the firing pin, readying the weapon to fire again. The bolt closes the breech end of the barrel and contains the firing pin. The bolt is held in place with a lever that fits into a notch. Moving this lever out of the notch will release the restraint on the bolt, allowing it to be drawn back. An extractor removes the spent cartridge, which is then ejected through the lever slot. A spring at the bottom of the magazine pushes up the reserve rounds, positioning the topmost between the bolt and the chamber at the base of the barrel. Pushing the bolt lever forward chambers this round and pushing the lever into the notch locks the bolt and enables the trigger mechanism. The complete cycle action also resets the firing pin. The Mauser rifle of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is the most famous of the bolt-action types, with most similar weapons derived from this pioneering design, such as the M1903 Springfield and the Karabiner 98 Kurz rifle (abbreviated often as Kar98k or simply K98). The Russian Mosin–Nagant rifle, the British Lee–Enfield, and the Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen are examples of bolt-action designs.

=== Autoloading ===

==== Blowback ====
In blowback operation, the bolt is not actually locked at the moment of firing. To prevent violent recoil, in most firearms using this mechanism the opening of the bolt is delayed in some way. In many small arms, the round is fired while the bolt is still travelling forward, and the bolt does not open until this forward momentum is overcome. Other methods involve delaying the opening until two rollers have been forced back into recesses in the receiver in which the bolt is carried. Simple blowback action is simple and inexpensive to manufacture, but is limited in the power it can handle, so it is seen on small caliber weapons such as machine pistols and submachine guns. Lever-delayed blowback, as seen in for example the French FAMAS assault rifle, can also handle more powerful cartridges but is more complicated and expensive to manufacture.

==== Recoil-operated ====

In a recoil-operated firearm, the breech is locked, and the barrel recoils as part of the firing cycle. In long-recoil actions, such as the Browning Auto-5 shotgun, the barrel and breechblock remain locked for the full recoil travel, and separate on the return; in short-recoil actions, typical of most semiautomatic handguns (e.g. the Colt M1911), the barrel recoils only a short distance before decoupling from the breechblock.

==== Gas-operated ====

In a gas-operated mechanism, a portion of the gases propelling the bullet from the barrel are extracted and used to operate a piston. The motion of this piston in turn unlocks and operates the bolt, which performs extraction of the spent cartridge and via spring action readies the next round. Almost all modern military rifles use mechanisms of this type.

<text>Irene Hervey (born Beulah Irene Herwick; July 11, 1909December 20, 1998) was an American film, stage, and television actress who appeared in over fifty films and numerous television series spanning her five-decade career.

A native of Los Angeles, Hervey was trained in her youth by British stage and film actress Emma Dunn, a friend of her mother. She signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933, appearing in several films for the studioincluding &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Return&quot; (1933), opposite Lionel Barrymorebefore landing a supporting role as Valentine de Villefort in United Artists&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934). She signed a contract with Universal Pictures, appearing in numerous films for the studio, including the Western &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939) opposite Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, the mystery &quot;The House of Fear&quot; (1939), and the musical &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (1940), the latter of which she appeared opposite her then-husband Allan Jones.

She appeared in films throughout the 1940s into the 1950s, including the horror film &quot;Night Monster&quot; (1942) opposite Bela Lugosi, the fantasy &quot;Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid&quot; (1948), and the film noir &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; (1956). Beginning in the mid-1950s, Hervey transitioned to television, appearing as a guest star on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Honey West&quot;, and &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, the latter of which earned her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. Hervey appeared in occasional minor film roles in her later career, such as Gene Saks&#x27;s &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1969) and Clint Eastwood&#x27;s thriller &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; (1971).

Hervey died on December 20, 1998, of heart failure in Los Angeles. She had two children, one of whom was pop singer Jack Jones.

==Early life==
Hervey was born Beulah Irene Herwick on July 11, 1909 in Venice, Los Angeles, California. Her father was a sign painter, and her mother a Christian Science practitioner whose pupil was English actress Emma Dunn. Dunn agreed to become Hervey&#x27;s acting coach during her childhood. Hervey attended Venice High School in Venice, Los Angeles, where she appeared in school theater productions.

==Career==
===Early films===

She began her acting career after being introduced to a casting agent from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). After a successful screen test, she was signed by the studio and made her screen debut in the 1933 film &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Return&quot;, opposite Lionel Barrymore.

Though signed by MGM, Hervey was loaned by the studio and appeared in several films including United Artists&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934) and &quot;With Words and Music&quot;, released by Grand National Films Inc. In 1934, she was cast as the murderess Myra in the thriller &quot;Rendezvous at Midnight&quot;, but was replaced by Irene Ware.

In 1936, Hervey left MGM and signed with Universal Pictures. While at Universal, Hervey appeared in &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot; (1937) and &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939) with Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart. She also intermittently freelanced at other studios, appearing in such films as Grand National Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Girl Said No&quot; (1937), a musical comedy featuring music by Gilbert and Sullivan.

At Universal from 1940 to 1943, Hervey had the lead in 11 B pictures, one A (&quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;) and one serial (&quot;Gang Busters&quot;).

In 1943, Hervey was seriously injured in a car accident and was forced to retire from acting for five years.
Though she did briefly return to acting for the stage play &quot;No Way Out&quot;, where she played Dr. Enid Karley, in 1944.

===Later career===
Hervey returned to acting in 1948 with the film &quot;Mickey&quot;, followed by &quot;Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid&quot;. By the early 1950s, she began appearing in television. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Hervey appeared in several television series, including the crime dramas &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, and &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;. She also made three guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;: in 1958, she played Helen Bartlett in &quot;The Case of the Black-Eyed Blonde&quot;; in 1961, she played Grace Davies in &quot;The Case of the Jealous Journalist&quot;, and in 1963, she played Jill Garson in &quot;The Case of the Lawful Lazarus&quot;. She returned to theater with a role opposite Hans Conried in &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot;, a comedy written by Henry and Phoebe Ephron, which had regional performances in Massachusetts and Connecticut in the summer of 1963. A reviewer from a local publication noted that Hervey &quot;registers effectively&quot; in her role. In 1965, she landed a regular role on &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot;, followed by a stint on the short-lived Anne Francis series &quot;Honey West&quot; as the titular character&#x27;s Aunt Meg.

In 1969, Hervey was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her appearance on &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. After her roles as Mrs. Durant in the comedy &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; and as Madge in the 1971 thriller film &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; with Clint Eastwood, Hervey retired from acting. She took a job working at a travel agency in Sherman Oaks, California and briefly returned to acting in 1978 with a role in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. In 1981, she made her last on-screen appearance in the television movie &quot;Goliath Awaits&quot;, which centers on a community of survivors from a World War II shipwreck who have survived decades living underwater.

==Personal life==
As a teenager, Hervey married her first husband William Fenderson in 1929 and had a daughter, Gail; they divorced. In the mid-1930s, she was engaged to Robert Taylor. In 1936, she met and married actor Allan Jones. The couple had a son, singer Jack Jones, born in 1938. They divorced in 1957.

Hervey died of heart failure on December 20, 1998; she was 89 and was residing at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. She was cremated, and her ashes returned to her surviving daughter.

<text>The Little Tennessee River (known locally as the Little T) is a tributary of the Tennessee River that flows through the Blue Ridge Mountains from Georgia, into North Carolina, and then into Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. It drains portions of three national forests— Chattahoochee, Nantahala, and Cherokee— and provides the southwestern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 

Numerous dams were erected on the river in the 20th century for flood control and hydropower generation. The river flows through five major impoundments: Fontana Dam, Cheoah Dam, Calderwood Dam, Chilhowee Dam, and Tellico Dam, and one smaller impoundment, Porters Bend Dam.

==Course==
The Little Tennessee River rises in the Blue Ridge Mountains, in the Chattahoochee National Forest in northeast Georgia&#x27;s Rabun County. After flowing north through the mountains past Dillard into southwestern North Carolina, it is joined by the Cullasaja River at Franklin. The river turns northwest, flowing through the Nantahala National Forest along the north side of the Nantahala Mountains. It crosses into eastern Tennessee and joins the Tennessee River at Lenoir City, 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Knoxville.

==Impoundments==
The lower river is impounded in several places by sequential dams, some created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system. They form a string of reservoirs in western North Carolina and East Tennessee down to the river&#x27;s confluence with the Tennessee. Near the state line between North Carolina and Tennessee, the Little Tennessee River is impounded by the Fontana Dam, completed in 1944, forming Fontana Lake along the southern boundary of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It is also impounded by Cheoah Dam in North Carolina, and by Calderwood and Chilhowee dams in Tennessee. The reservoirs provide flood control and hydroelectric power.

Calderwood and Cheoah dams divert water through short tunnels slightly downstream of the dams to hydroelectric generators. Chilhowee has power generators built directly into the dam itself. Some water is also diverted from the nearby Santeetlah Dam on the Cheoah River to power another hydroelectric generator at the Santeetlah Powerhouse. This water is brought to the Little Tennessee River through of tunnels through the Great Smoky Mountains. Chilhowee, Calderwood, and Cheoah Dams and the Santeetlah Powerhouse were originally built by Alcoa to power the aluminum plant at Alcoa, Tennessee. To ensure efficiency in operation, Alcoa coordinates the operation of its hydro system with TVA, making sure that reservoir and river water levels are safe for recreational use (primarily boating and fishing) and that proper flows of water continue down the river.

The final impoundment is Tellico Dam, which is just above its mouth into the Tennessee River at Lenoir City, Tennessee. It creates Tellico Reservoir. The dam does not have its own hydroelectric generators, but serves to increase the flow through those at nearby Fort Loudoun Dam on the Tennessee by means of a canal that diverts much of the flow of the Little Tennessee. 

The proposed project to build the dam and reservoir was the subject of environmental controversy during the 1970s because of the discovery of the snail darter, an endangered species. It was the first major legal challenge to the Endangered Species Act.

==History==
The Little Tennessee River and its immediate watershed comprise one of the richest archaeological areas in the southeastern United States, containing substantial indigenous habitation sites dating to as early as 7,500 B.C. Cyrus Thomas, who conducted a survey in the 1880s of earthwork mounds in the area for the Smithsonian Institution, wrote that the Little Tennessee River was &quot;undoubtedly the most interesting archaeological section in the entire Appalachian district.&quot;

Substantial Archaic period (8000-1000 B.C.) sites along the river include the Icehouse Bottom and the Rose Island sites, both located near the confluence of the Tellico River with the Little Tennessee in present-day Tennessee. These sites were probably semi-permanent base camps, the inhabitants of which may have sought the chert deposits on the bluffs above the river which they used to create tools.

Evidence of Woodland period (1000 B.C. - 1000 A.D.) habitation has been uncovered at numerous sites along the Little Tennessee on this side of the mountains, most notably at Icehouse Bottom, Rose Island, Calloway Island (near the river&#x27;s confluence with Toqua Creek), Thirty Acre Island (near the river&#x27;s confluence with Nine Mile Creek), and Bacon Bend (between Toqua and Citico Beach). Salvage archeological excavations in the 1970s before completion of the Tellico Dam uncovered large groups of Woodland-period burials on both Rose and Calloway islands in present-day Tennessee. Pottery fragments uncovered at Icehouse Bottom in the 1970s show evidence of interaction with the Hopewell people of what is now Ohio.

Mississippian period (c. 1000-1500 A.D.) sites in the Little Tennessee Valley include the Toqua site (at the river&#x27;s confluence with Toqua Creek), Tomotley (adjacent to Toqua), Citico (at the river&#x27;s Citico Creek confluence), and Bussell Island (at the mouth of the river). Toqua&#x27;s Mississippian inhabitants constructed a high platform mound overlooking a central plaza. By 1400, the village covered , surrounded by a clay-covered palisade.

Several Cherokee Middle Towns, including Nikwasi, Watauga, Jore, and Cowee, were located along the upper Little Tennessee River&#x27;s section in present-day North Carolina section. Mounds built about 1000 CE by ancestral Mississippian culture people have survived at these sites. 

As noted above, the river was the spine of most of the major Overhill Cherokee towns, the most prominent of which included Chota, Tanasi, Toqua, Tomotley, Mialoquo (near Rose Island), Chilhowee (at the river&#x27;s Abrams Creek confluence), Tallassee (near modern Calderwood), Citico, and Tuskegee (adjacent to Fort Loudoun).

Euro-American traders were visiting the Overhill towns along the Little Tennessee by the late 17th century. There is some evidence that Spanish explorers Hernando De Soto and Juan Pardo passed through the Little Tennessee Valley in 1540 and 1567, respectively. 

In 1756 the English built Fort Loudoun, located at the river&#x27;s confluence with the Tellico River, for defenses during the French and Indian War. This was the name for the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe between the English and French. The fort has been reconstructed as an historic site. Two early American sites are located along the Little Tennessee— the Tellico Blockhouse, an outpost at the river&#x27;s Nine Mile Creek confluence, and Morganton, a river port and ferry town near modern Greenback, which thrived in the early 19th century. The Hazel Creek section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, located on the north shore of the river&#x27;s Fontana Lake impoundment, was home to a substantial European-American Appalachian community in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Armstrong was unable to overcome the effects of a serious economic downturn in the region, underestimated the strength of the Maritime Rights Movement and the feelings of alienation among Nova Scotians, and also mishandled labour unrest in Cape Breton, all of which led to the defeat of his government in the 1925 election. The Liberals won only three seats out of 43 in the legislature. He died in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.
