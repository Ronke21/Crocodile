<text>was the lead ship of the light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

&quot;Cleveland&quot; was commissioned in June 1942, and saw extensive service in the war, briefly in the Atlantic, and then in the Pacific theater. Like almost all of her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and never saw active service again. &quot;Cleveland&quot; was scrapped in the early 1960s.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Cleveland&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of eight Bofors guns in two quadruple mounts and thirteen Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Cleveland&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
On 1 November 1941, Hull No. 423 was launched and christened &quot;Cleveland&quot;. Built by New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, and sponsored by Mrs. H. Burton, &quot;Cleveland&quot; was commissioned on 15 June 1942, with Captain E. W. Burrough in command. Clearing Norfolk&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay on 10 October 1942, &quot;Cleveland&quot; joined a task force off Bermuda (on 29 October) bound for the invasion of North Africa. Her firepower supported the landings at Fedhala, French Morocco on 8 November, and she remained on patrol until 12 November, returning to Norfolk on 24 November.

&quot;Cleveland&quot; sailed for the Pacific on 5 December 1942, and arrived at Efate Island on 16 January. Her first mission in the consolidation of the Solomon Islands was with Task Force 18 (TF 18) to guard a troop convoy to Guadalcanal from 27 to 31 January, &quot;Cleveland&quot; fired on the enemy as she came under heavy air attack in the Battle of Rennell Island on 29–30 January.

Joining TF 68, &quot;Cleveland&quot; steamed up &quot;the Slot&quot; on 6 March 1943 to bombard Japanese airfields at Vila on Kolombangara, then joined in the night action which sank the destroyers and in the battle of Blackett Strait.

Command of &quot;Cleveland&quot; passed to Captain Andrew G. Shepard in June. Still with TF 68, &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, &quot;Cleveland&quot; fired in the bombardment of the Shortland Islands on 30 June and provided gun support for the invasion landings at Munda, New Georgia on 12 July. Following a short repair period at Sydney, Australia, &quot;Cleveland&quot; sailed for the preinvasion bombardment of the Treasury Islands on 26–27 October. Her task force steamed to blast Buka Island and Bonis on 1 November in support of the troops invading Bougainville, dashed south the same day to neutralize bases in the Shortlands, and that night intercepted a Japanese force in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay which was to win her a Navy Unit Commendation. &quot;Cleveland&quot; poured her radar-controlled fire into the four Japanese cruisers for over an hour, aiding in sinking , then chased the fleeing ships until daybreak. An air attack followed and one stick of bombs severely rocked &quot;Cleveland&quot;, who answered by splashing several of the enemy planes. She returned to Buka for another bombardment on 23 December, then patrolled between Truk and Green Island, Papua New Guinea from 13 to 18 February 1944 while American forces captured the latter.

After supporting the capture of Emirau Island from 17 to 23 March, &quot;Cleveland&quot; sailed for replenishment and repairs at Sydney, Australia, then returned to the Solomons on 21 April to prepare for the Marianas operation. One practice bombardment on 20 May brought return fire unexpectedly which straddled the ship, but unharmed, she quickly silenced the shore batteries.

From 8 June to 12 August, &quot;Cleveland&quot; participated in the Marianas operation. On 24 July, during the invasion of Tinian, &quot;Cleveland&quot; came to the aid of the destroyer . &quot;Norman Scott&quot; was hit six times within a few seconds by shore batteries. &quot;Cleveland&quot; maneuvered between &quot;Norman Scott&quot; and the shore batteries, preventing her from taking any more hits. She conducted softening-up bombardments and then gave fire support for invading troops until she joined TF 58 for the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June. Although few enemy aircraft penetrated the screen of American carrier planes, &quot;Cleveland&quot; was credited with splashing at least one enemy aircraft and assisting in downing another of the few which did get through.

From 12 to 29 September, &quot;Cleveland&quot; participated in the invasion of the Palaus, then sailed from Manus Island on 5 October for a stateside overhaul. She arrived in Subic Bay on 9 February 1945, and sailed on to bombard Corregidor on 13–14 February, effectively neutralizing the fortress before the landings there. Continuing to support the consolidation of the Philippines, she covered the landings at Puerto Princesa, the Visayas, Panay, and the Malabang-Parang area on Mindanao.

&quot;Cleveland&quot; put out from Subic Bay on 7 June to act as part of the covering force and provide fire support for the invasion landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo on 10 June. She returned to Subic Bay on 15 June, then sailed to Manila to embark General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and his staff as observers of the assault on Balikpapan. Arriving on 30 June, she fired in a pre-landing bombardment the next morning, and after General MacArthur had made an inspection tour of the landing area, got underway for Manila, arriving on 3 July.

With a new cruiser task force, &quot;Cleveland&quot; sailed on 13 July to Okinawa, arriving on 16 July. From this base Task Force 95 made a series of sweeps against Japanese shipping until 7 August to ensure Allied control of the East China Sea. &quot;Cleveland&quot; got underway from Okinawa on 9 September to support the occupation of Japan by covering the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war from Wakayama, then serving as part of a naval occupation group until the 6th Army made its landings on Honshū. After a short stay in Tokyo Bay (28 October – 1 November), &quot;Cleveland&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor, San Diego, the Panama Canal, and Boston, arriving on 5 December for overhaul. She operated out of Newport on various training exercises, including a Naval Reserve training cruise to Bermuda in April 1946 and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Quebec in June 1946, before reporting to Philadelphia for inactivation. &quot;Cleveland&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve there on 7 February 1947, until sold for scrap, 18 February 1960.

==Awards==
In addition to her Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Cleveland&quot; received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>North Bethesda station is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro in North Bethesda, Maryland. The North Bethesda station was opened on December 15, 1984, as White Flint and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Red Line, the station serves residential and commercial areas of North Bethesda and Rockville and is located near the former White Flint Mall and the new Pike &amp; Rose mixed-use development.

==Location==
North Bethesda station serves commercial and residential areas of North Bethesda and Rockville. The station entrance is located immediately adjacent to the headquarters of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The large Pike &amp; Rose mixed-use development sits one block north of the station. The former site of its original &quot;White Flint&quot; namesake, White Flint Mall, is located about southeast of the station and was shuttered in 2015.

===Transit-oriented development===
North Bethesda station is at the center of the Pike District (formerly White Flint) planning area which was the subject of two sector plans (in 2010 and 2018) that were intended to generate dense, transit-oriented development. The sector plans prescribed new zoning to allow taller buildings to be built closer to the Metro station along with a new street grid to link disjointed areas.

==History==
The station opened on December 15, 1984 as part of a , four-station northwestern extension of the Red Line between Grosvenor–Strathmore and Shady Grove stations. White Flint was originally known as Nicholson Lane in planning documents, but the station was renamed after the White Flint Mall before it opened. A pylon at Farragut North still bears the original name of the station; extensions were originally printed on pylons throughout the system and covered up until they opened.

On December 9, 2021, the Metro board voted to change the name of the station from White Flint to North Bethesda. The new name was added to Metro system maps when the second phase of the Silver Line opened on November 15, 2022. In June 2022, signage in the station began to be modified to reflect the name change. The new name change became official on September 11, 2022.

==Station layout==
North Bethesda station has an island platform located just below street level in an open cut, which leads to a tunnel on either side of the station. Access to the station is provided at ground level at the northeast corner of Rockville Pike and Marinelli Road, with a Metro-style underpass providing access to the northwest corner of the intersection. A parking garage is located east of the station on Marinelli Road. The station features escalators with the elevator between them as seen at Addison Road and Union Station between the mezzanine and platform.

<text>Twinbrook station is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro attached to the Twinbrook neighborhood of Rockville, Maryland. One of a number of stations on the Rockville Pike corridor, it primarily acts as a commuter station.

==Location==
Twinbrook station is located in the southern section of Rockville, one of the largest communities in Montgomery County. Specifically, it lies to the east of the intersection of Rockville Pike and Halpine Road, the railway&#x27;s right-of-way splitting the latter in two.

===Transit-oriented development===
Like other Metro stations in Montgomery County, Twinbrook is a center for planned transit-oriented development. The county planning department released the Twinbrook Sector Plan in 2009, which acts as a guideline for mixed-use, walkable development around the station. To fulfill this vision, the plan splits the surrounding area into three zones heading east: a mixed-use urban core area, a technology center, and a light industrial section. In addition, it calls for the redesign of certain arterial roads in the neighborhood such as Twinbrook Parkway and Parklawn Drive as well as connecting dead-end streets to create a grid, aiding walkability. Not included in the Sector Plan is the Twinbrook Station project, which occupies land directly adjacent to the Metro station.

==History==
The station opened on December 15, 1984 as part of a , four-station northwestern extension of the Red Line between Grosvenor–Strathmore and Shady Grove stations.

==Station layout==
Twinbrook is served by an island platform west of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, which carry Amtrak and MARC Trains. Both the east and west sides of the station have bus bays, surface parking, and kiss and ride lots. These areas are connected to each other and to the platform by a ground-level underpass underneath the embankment holding the tracks. The station is also the only one to have only a single escalator serving the platform, usually heading up. An elevator and stairs provide access to exit the platform area. East of this station, it goes into a short tunnel.

<doc id="560552" wikidata="Q688866" url="?curid=560552" title="National League (ice hockey)">
<text>The National League (NL) is a professional ice hockey league in Switzerland and is the top tier of the Swiss league system. Prior to the 2017–18 season, the league was known as National League A. During the 2018–19 season, the league had an average of 6,949 spectators per game which is the highest among European leagues (ahead of the KHL with 6,397 and the DEL with 6,215). The capital city&#x27;s club SC Bern has been ranked first of all European clubs for 18 seasons and had an average attendance of 16,290 after the regular season. The ZSC Lions are another club in the top ten of European ice hockey attendance, ranking seventh with 9,694 spectators.

Teams from the NL participate in the IIHF&#x27;s annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the NL was ranked the No. 2 league in Europe, allowing it to send its top five teams to compete in the CHL.

==Season structure==
During the regular season, each of the 14 teams play 52 games. The top eight teams after the regular season qualify for the playoffs to determine the Swiss champion in best-of-seven series. The bottom four teams in the standings play a relegation tournament, called playouts, in which each team retains their regular season points and play an additional six matches. Following those matches, the two bottom ranked teams will play each other in a best-of-seven series, with the loser then playing the winner of the Swiss League playoffs in a best-of-seven series for a spot in the successive NL season.

==Current teams==


==Import players==
The current gentlemen&#x27;s agreement allows teams to dress a maximum of six non-Swiss players for each game. There is no official rule as it would be against Swiss laws to limit foreign workers in a given enterprise. This agreement is not directly related to Swiss citizenship as players with different nationalities but with Swiss player-licenses are considered Swiss players, thus they do not count as import players. Some current examples of this scenario are Josh Jooris with Genève-Servette HC and Floran Douay with HC Ambrì-Piotta. They all play with Swiss player-licenses as they have spent a good majority of their childhoods playing hockey with junior teams in Switzerland yet they do not possess Swiss citizenships. Such players would not be able to play in the NL if it was not for their Swiss player-licenses as they would not be considered good enough to use an import player spot on any team. Those spots are usually reserved for players who have had good NHL careers or players with great stats and performances in the AHL, SHL, KHL or Liiga.

The subject of import players has been and still is a huge subject of debates among team owners and GMs. Some of them wish to allow more import players per game in order to reduce the salaries of star Swiss players and the others want to keep that limit lower to allow more Swiss players to play on special units and have top roles on their teams.

==Media coverage==
NL games are only available in Switzerland and MySports is the league&#x27;s official broadcaster, airing all regular season and playoffs games. MySports pays CHF 35 million per year to broadcast NL games. Games are available with German, French and Italian commentaries.

Starting with the 2022/23 season, selected games are regularly broadcast on free-to-air local channels in all three linguistic regions.

The SRG SSR lost all broadcasting rights as of the 2024-25 season.

<doc id="560553" wikidata="Q2301947" url="?curid=560553" title="St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem">
<text>St. George&#x27;s Cathedral is an Anglican (Episcopal) cathedral in Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, established in 1899. It became the seat of the Bishop of Jerusalem of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East, having taken the title from Christ Church, Jerusalem, built 50 years before. 

It is located about two hundred meters (yards) away from the Garden Tomb, a popular site of Anglican and Protestant pilgrimage and devotion.

The church was built by the fourth bishop of the diocese, George Blyth. Most missionaries present in Palestine at the time were Evangelical Anglicans, but Blyth was from the Anglo-Catholic party of the Church of England. Finding that his use of St Paul&#x27;s and Christ Church (both in Jerusalem) were limited, he resolved to found his own mission and build his own church. &quot;He bought land in east Jerusalem where he built his cathedral and a missionary college, both called St. George&#x27;s, making them the headquarters of a mission program independent of the two evangelical societies.&quot;

In order to fund the construction of the church, Blyth founded the Jerusalem and the East Mission.

Under Bishop Samuel Gobat, relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church had become strained. Blyth was eager to restore relations with the patriarch and as an Anglo-Catholic he had a great respect for the patriarch&#x27;s office. Because of this he always called St George&#x27;s a collegiate church rather than a cathedral, saying that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was the one and only cathedral church of the city of Jerusalem. For this reason, St. George&#x27;s contains a pool – a rarity in Anglican churches – which allows baptisms to be done through immersion, per Orthodox custom.

Herbert Danby became the librarian there in 1919 and was residentiary canon from 1921 to 1936. The Israeli whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu has been residing at the cathedral since his release from prison in 2004. St. George&#x27;s College is located on the grounds and offers continuing theological education for clergy and laity from around the world.

<text>Theodore of Mopsuestia (Greek: Θεοδώρος, c. 350 – 428) was a Christian theologian, and Bishop of Mopsuestia (as Theodore II) from 392 to 428 AD. He is also known as Theodore of Antioch, from the place of his birth and presbyterate. He is the best known representative of the middle Antioch School of hermeneutics.

==Life and work==
Theodore was born at Antioch, where his father held an official position and the family was wealthy (Chrysostom, &quot;ad Th. Laps.&quot; ii). Theodore&#x27;s cousin, Paeanius, to whom several of John Chrysostom&#x27;s letters are addressed, held an important post of civil government; his brother Polychronius became bishop of the metropolitan see of Apamea. Theodore first appears as the early companion and friend of Chrysostom, his fellow-townsman, his equal in rank, and but two or three years his senior in age. Together with their common friend Maximus, who was later bishop of Isaurian Seleucia, Chrysostom and Theodore attended the lectures of the Greek-speaking teacher of rhetoric Libanius (Socr. vi.3; Soz. viii.1), then at Antioch in the zenith of his fame. We have the assurance of Sozomen that he enjoyed a philosophical education. Chrysostom credits his friend with diligent study, but the luxurious life of polite Antioch seems to have received an equal share of his thoughts. When Chrysostom himself had been converted to the monastic life of Basil of Caesarea, he likewise converted Maximus and Theodore. The three friends left Libanius and sought a retreat in the monastic school of Carterius and Diodorus, to which Basil was already attached. It is unclear whether Theodore had been previously baptized before taking up monastic vows. Yet from the writings of Chrysostom it is clear he found joy in ascetic self-discipline, and he had just assumed a celibate life when he was fascinated by a girl named Hermione (Chrysostom ibid. i.), and contemplated marriage, at the same time returning to his former manner of life (Soz. viii.2). His &quot;fall&quot; spread consternation through the little society, and the anxiety drew forth from Chrysostom the earliest of his literary compositions—two letters &quot;to Theodore upon his fall.&quot; These compositions kept Theodore fast to his vows, although the disappointment left traces in his later life.

Chrysostom&#x27;s connection with Diodore was probably broken off in 374, when he plunged into a more complete monastic seclusion; Theodore&#x27;s seems to have continued until the elevation of Diodore to the see of Tarsus in 378. During this period doubtless the foundations were laid of Theodore&#x27;s understanding of the Bible and ecclesiastical doctrine, and he was imbued for life with the principles of scriptural interpretation which Diodore had inherited from an earlier generation of Antiochenes, and with the peculiar views of the Person of Christ into which the master had been led by his antagonism to Apollinaris of Laodicea. The latter years of this decade witnessed Theodore&#x27;s first appearance as a writer. He began with a commentary on the Psalms, in which the method of Diodore was exaggerated, and which he lived to repent of (Facund. iii.6, x.1; v. infra, §III). The orthodox at Antioch, it seems, resented the loss of the traditional Messianic interpretation, and, according to Hesychius of Jerusalem, Theodore was compelled to promise that he would commit his maiden work to the flames—a promise he contrived to evade (Mansi, ix.284).

Gennadius of Marseilles (&quot;de Vir. Ill.&quot; 12) represents Theodore as a presbyter of the church of Antioch; and from a letter of John of Antioch (Facund. ii.2) we gather that forty-five years elapsed between his ordination and his death. That would mean he was ordained priest at Antioch in 383, in his thirty-third year, the ordaining bishop being doubtless Flavian, Diodore&#x27;s old friend and fellow-laborer, whose &quot;loving disciple&quot; Theodore now became (John of Antioch, ap. Facund. l.c.). The epithet seems to imply that Theodore was an adherent of the Meletian party, but there is no evidence that he was involved in the feuds which preoccupied the Catholics of Antioch during Flavian&#x27;s office. Theodore&#x27;s great treatise on the Incarnation belongs to this period according to Gennadius, and possibly also more than one of his commentaries on the Old Testament. As a preacher he seems to have now attained some eminence in the field of polemics (Facund. viii.4). Theodore is said by Hesychius to have left Antioch while yet a priest and remained in Tarsus until 392, when he was consecrated to the see of Mopsuestia on the death of Olympius, probably through the influence of Diodore. Theodoret states he spent his remaining thirty-six years of life in this town.

Mopsuestia was a free town (Pliny) upon the Pyramus (Ceyhan) river, between Tarsus and Issus, some forty miles from either, and twelve from the sea. It belonged to Cilicia Secunda, of which the metropolitan see was Anazarbus. In the 4th century it was of some importance, famous for its bridge, thrown over the Pyramus by Constantine I.

Theodore&#x27;s long episcopate was marked by no striking incidents. His letters, long known to the Assyrians as the &quot;Book of Pearls&quot;, are lost; his followers have left us few personal recollections. In 394 he attended a synod at Constantinople on a question which concerned the see of Bostra in the patriarchate of Antioch. While there, Theodore had the opportunity to preach before the emperor Theodosius I, who was then starting for his last journey to the West. The sermon made a deep impression, and Theodosius, who had sat at the feet of Ambrose and Gregory Nazianzus, declared that he had never met with such a teacher (John of Antioch, ap. Facund. ii.2). Theodosius II inherited his grandfather&#x27;s respect for Theodore, and often wrote to him. Another glimpse of Theodore&#x27;s episcopal life is supplied by a letter of Chrysostom to him from Cucusus (AD 404–407) (Chrys. Ep. 212). The exiled patriarch &quot;can never forget the love of Theodore, so genuine and warm, so sincere and guileless, a love maintained from early years, and manifested but now.&quot; Chrysostom (Ep. 204) thanks him profoundly for frequent though ineffectual efforts to obtain his release, and praises their friendship in such glowing terms that Theodore&#x27;s enemies at the fifth Ecumenical Council made unsuccessful efforts to deny the identity of Chrysostom&#x27;s correspondent with the bishop of Mopsuestia.

Notwithstanding his literary activity, Theodore worked zealously for the good of his diocese. The famous letter of Ibas to Maris testifies that he struggled against extinguished Arianism and other heresies in Mopsuestia. Several of his works are doubtless monuments of these pastoral labors, e.g. the catechetical lectures, the &quot;ecthesis,&quot; and possibly the treatise on &quot;Persian Magic.&quot; Yet his episcopal work was by no means simply that of a diocesan bishop. Everywhere he was regarded as &quot;the herald of the truth and the doctor of the church&quot;; &quot;even distant churches received instruction from him.&quot; So Ibas explained to Maris, and his letter was read without a dissentient voice at the Council of Chalcedon (Facund. ii.i seq.). Theodore &quot;expounded Scripture in all the churches of the East,&quot; says John of Antioch (ibid. ii.2), with some literary license, and adds that in his lifetime Theodore was never arraigned by any of the orthodox. But in a letter to Nestorius (ibid. x.2) John begs him to retract, urging the example of Theodore, who, when in a sermon at Antioch he had said something which gave great and manifest offence, for the sake of peace and to avoid scandal, after a few days publicly corrected himself. Leontius tells us that the cause of offence was a denial to the Virgin Mary of the title Theotokos. So great was the storm that the people threatened to stone the preacher (Cyril of Alexandria Ep. 69). The heretical sects attacked by Theodore showed their resentment in a way less overt, but perhaps more formidable. They tampered with his writings, hoping thus to involve him in heterodox statements (Facund. x.1).

Theodore&#x27;s last years were complicated by two controversies. When in 418 the Pelagian leaders were deposed and exiled from the West, they sought in the East the sympathy of the chief living representative of the school of Antioch. This fact is recorded by Marius Mercator, who makes the most of it (&quot;Praef. ad Symb. Theod. Mop.&quot; 72). They probably resided with Theodore till 422, when Julian of Eclanum returned to Italy. Julian&#x27;s visit was doubtless the occasion upon which Theodore wrote his book &quot;Against the Defenders of Original Sin&quot;. Mercator charges Theodore with having turned against Julian as soon as the latter had left Mopsuestia, and anathematized him in a provincial synod. The synod can hardly be a fabrication, since Mercator was a contemporary writer; but it was very possibly convened, as Fritzsche suggests, without any special reference to the Pelagian question. If Theodore then read his ecthesis, the anathema with which that ends might have been represented outside the council as a synodical condemnation of the Pelagian chiefs. Mercator&#x27;s words, in fact, point to this explanation.

A greater heresiarch than Julian visited Mopsuestia in the last year of his life. It is stated by Evagrius Scholasticus (&quot;H.E.&quot; i.2) that &quot;Nestorius, on his way from Antioch to Constantinople (AD 428), took counsel with Theodore and received from him the seeds of heresy which he shortly afterwards scattered with such disastrous results.&quot; Evagrius makes this statement on the authority of one Theodulus, a person otherwise unknown. We may safely reject it, so far as it derives the Christology of Nestorius from this single interview. Towards the close of 428 (Theodoret, &quot;H.E.&quot; v.39) Theodore died at the age of seventy-eight, having been all his life engaged in controversy, and more than once in conflict with the popular notions of orthodoxy; yet he departed, as Facundus (ii.1) triumphantly points out, in the peace of the church and at the height of a great reputation. The storm was gathering, but did not break until after his death. As the Catholic Encyclopedia points out, during his lifetime, Theodore was considered an orthodox Christian thinker.

==Posthumous legacy==
The popularity of Theodore increased following his death. Meletius, his successor at Mopsuestia, protested that his life would have been in danger if he had uttered a word against his predecessor (Tillemont, &quot;Mém.&quot; xii. p. 442). &quot;We believe as Theodore believed; long live the faith of Theodore!&quot; was a cry often heard in the churches of the East (Cyril of Alexandria, Ep. 69). &quot;We had rather be burnt than condemn Theodore,&quot; was the reply of the bishops of Syria to the party eager for his condemnation (Ep. 72). The flame was fed by leading men who had been disciples of the Interpreter: by Theodoret, who regarded him as a &quot;doctor of the universal church&quot; (H. E. v. 39); by Ibas of Edessa, who in 433 wrote his famous letter to Maris in praise of Theodore; by John I of Antioch, who in 428 succeeded to the see of Antioch.

Shortly after Theodore&#x27;s death men in other quarters began to hold him up to obloquy. As early perhaps as 431 Marius Mercator denounced him as the real author of the Pelagian heresy (&quot;Lib. subnot. in verba Juliani&quot;, ); and not long afterwards prefaced his translation of Theodore&#x27;s ecthesis with a still more violent attack on him as the precursor of Nestorianism. The council of Ephesus, however, while it condemned Nestorius by name, did not mention Theodore. The Nestorian party consequently fell back upon the words of Theodore, and began to circulate them in several languages as affording the best available exposition of their views (&quot;Liberat. Brev.&quot; 10). This circumstance deepened the mistrust of the orthodox, and even in the East there were some who proceeded to condemn the teaching of Theodore. Hesychius of Jerusalem attacked him around 435 in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;; Rabbula, bishop of Edessa, who at Ephesus had sided with John of Antioch, now publicly anathematized Theodore (Ibas, &quot;Ep. ad Marin.&quot;). Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople demanded from the bishops of Syria a condemnation of certain propositions supposed to have been drawn from the writings of Theodore. Cyril, who had once spoken favourably of some of Theodore&#x27;s works (Facund. viii.6), now under the influence of Rabbula took a decided attitude of opposition; he wrote to the synod of Antioch (Ep. 67) that the opinions of Diodore, Theodore, and others of the same schools had &quot;borne down with full sail upon the glory of Christ&quot;; to the emperor (Ep. 71), that Diodore and Theodore were the parents of the blasphemy of Nestorius; to Proclus (Ep. 72), that had Theodore been still alive and openly approved of the teaching of Nestorius, he ought undoubtedly to have been anathematized; but as he was dead, it was enough to condemn the errors of his books, having regard to the terrible disturbances more extreme measures would excite in the East. He collected and answered a series of propositions gathered from the writings of Diodore and Theodore, a work to which Theodoret replied shortly afterwards.

The ferment then subsided for a time, but the disciples of Theodore, repulsed in the West, pushed their way from Eastern Syria to Persia. Ibas, who succeeded Rabbula in 435, restored the School of Edessa, and it continued to be a nursery of Theodore&#x27;s theology till suppressed by Emperor Zeno in 489 and found refuge at Nisibis. Among the Nestorians of Persia the writings of Theodore were regarded as the standard both of doctrine and of interpretation, and the Persian church returned the censures of the Roman church by pronouncing an anathema on all who opposed or rejected them (cf. Assem. iii.i.84; and for a full account of the spread of Theodore&#x27;s opinions at Edessa and Nisibis see Kihn, &quot;Theodor und Junilius&quot;, pp. 198–209, 333–336).

The 6th century witnessed another and final outbreak of hatred against Theodore. The fifth general council (553), under the influence of the emperor Justinian I, pronounced the anathema which neither Theodosius II nor Cyril thought to issue. This condemnation of Theodore and his two supporters led to the Controversy of the Three Chapters but we may point out one result of Justinian&#x27;s policy. The African delegation objected not only to a decree which seemed to negate the authority of the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, but also violated the sanctity of the dead; they had no particular interest in Theodore&#x27;s doctrine or method of interpretation. Bishop Pontian plainly told the emperor that he had asked them to condemn men of whose writings they knew nothing. But the stir about Theodore led to inquiry; his works, or portions of them, were translated and circulated in the West. It is almost certainly to this cause that we owe the preservation in a Latin dress of at least one-half of Theodore&#x27;s commentaries on Paul. Published under the name of Ambrose of Milan, the work of Theodore passed from Africa into the monastic libraries of the West, was copied into the compilations of Rabanus Maurus and others, and in its fuller and its abridged form supplied the Middle Ages with an accepted interpretation of an important part of the Bible. The name of Theodore, however, disappears almost entirely from Western church literature after the 6th century. It was scarcely before the 19th century that justice was done by Western writers to the importance of the great Antiochene as a theologian, an expositor and a precursor of later thought.

Theodore believed that the torment of hell will be finite and will serve to reform sinners (a form of Christian universalism) and he was quoted as an authority on this issue by later bishops of the Church of the East: St. Isaac of Nineveh (7th cent.) and
Solomon of Basra (13th cent.), the author of the Book of the Bee. In the 19th century, Edward Beecher discussed Theodore&#x27;s belief in the finiteness of hell and stressed that it was neither based on the allegorical interpretation of the Bible nor derived from Origen.

==Literary remains==
Facundus (x.4) speaks of Theodore&#x27;s &quot;innumerable books&quot;; John of Antioch, in a letter quoted by Facundus (ii.2), describes his polemical works as alone numbering &quot;decem millia&quot; (i.e. muria), an exaggeration of course, but based on fact. A catalogue of such of his writings as were once extant in Syriac translations is given by Abdisho, Nestorian metropolitan of Nisibis, AD 1318 (J. S. Assem. &quot;Bibl. Orient.&quot; iii.i. pp. 30 seq.). These Syriac translations filled 41 tomes. Only one whole work remains.

His commentary on the minor prophets has been preserved and was published by Mai (Rome, 1825–1832) and Wegnern. It is noteworthy for its independence of earlier hermeneutical authorities and Theodore&#x27;s reluctance to admit a Christological reference. It is marked by his usual defects of style; it is nevertheless a considerable monument of his expository power, and the best illustration we possess of the Antiochene method of interpreting Old Testament prophecy.

A fortunate discovery in the 19th century gave us a complete Latin translation of the commentary on Galatians and the nine following epistles, which were published in two volumes by Henry Barclay Swete (Cambridge: 1880, 1882). The Latin, apparently the work of an African churchman of the time of the Fifth council, abounds in colloquial and semi-barbarous forms; the version is not always careful, and sometimes almost hopelessly corrupt (published by Cambridge University Press, 1880–1882). But this translation gives us the substance of Theodore&#x27;s interpretation of the apostle Paul, and so we have a typical commentary from his pen on a considerable portion of each Testament.

Theodore&#x27;s commentaries on the rest of the Bible have survived only in quotations and excerpts. His commentary on Genesis is cited by Cosmas Indicopleustes, John Philoponus, and Photius (Cod. 3, 8). Latin fragments are found in the Acts of the second council of Constantinople, and an important collection of Syriac fragments from the Nitrian manuscripts of the British Museum was published by Dr. Eduard Sachau (&quot;Th. Mops. Fragm. Syriaca&quot;, Lips. 1869, pp. 1–21). Photius, criticizing the style of this work in words more or less applicable to all the remains of Theodore, notices the writer&#x27;s opposition to the allegorical method of interpretation. Ebedjesu was struck by the care and elaboration bestowed upon the work.

The printed fragments of his commentaries on the Psalms, in Greek and Latin, fill 25 columns in Migne. More recently attention has been called to a Syriac version (Baethgen), and new fragments of a Latin version and of the original Greek have been printed. His preference for historically sensitive interpretation led him to deny the application to Christ of all but three or four of the Psalms usually regarded as Messianic. Evidently, he later came to regard the book as somewhat hasty and premature.

Besides pieces of his commentaries on books from the Old and New Testament, we have fragments or notices of his writings on various topics. Chief amongst these, and first in point of time, was his treatise in fifteen books, on the Incarnation. According to Gennadius (&quot;de Vir. Ill.&quot; 12) it was directed against the Apollinarians and Eunomians, and written while the author was yet a presbyter of Antioch. Gennadius adds an outline of the contents. After a logical and scriptural demonstration of the truth and perfection of each of the natures in Christ, Theodore deals more at length with the Sacred Manhood. In book 14, he discusses the subject of the Trinity and the relation of the creation to the Divine. Large fragments of this treatise have been collected from various quarters. None of the remains of Theodore throw such important light upon his Christology.

Works that have not survived as well include: his &quot;de Apollinario et eius Haeresi&quot; and other polemics against Apollinarianism; and a separate polemic against Eunomius of Cyzicus, professing to be a defense of Basil of Caesarea. Photius mentions that Theodore wrote three books on &quot;Persian Magic&quot; where he not only attacked Zoroastrianism, but also betrayed his &quot;Nestorian&quot; views and advocated the notion of the eventual restoration of sinners.

Ebedjesu includes in his list &quot;two tomes on the Holy Spirit&quot;, probably a work directed against the heresy of the Pneumatomachi; and &quot;two tomes against him who asserts that sin is inherent in human nature.&quot; The last works were directed at Jerome though they did not accurately represent his positions since Theodore was not personally acquainted with his writings, but relied on information provided by Julian of Eclanum. Julian&#x27;s &quot;Ad Florum&quot;, a polemic against Augustine, and Theodore&#x27;s works against Jerome used many of the same arguments.

Lastly, Leontius intimates that Theodore wrote a portion of a liturgy; &quot;not content with drafting a new creed, he sought to impose upon the church a new Anaphora&quot;. The Hallowing of Theodore of Mopsuestia, an East Syriac liturgy ascribed to &quot;Mar Teodorus the Interpreter&quot; is still used by the East Syriac Rite Churches for a third of the year, from Advent to Palm Sunday. The proanaphoral and post-communion portions are supplied by the older liturgy &quot;of the Apostles&quot; (so called), the anaphora only being peculiar. Internal evidence confirms the judgment of Dr. Neale, who regards it as a genuine work of Theodore.

His lost work on the incarnation was discovered in 1905 in a Syriac translation in the mountains of northern Iraq in a Nestorian monastery. The manuscript was acquired by the scholar-archbishop Addai Scher and placed in his episcopal library at Seert. Unfortunately it was lost in the destruction of that library by Turkish troops during the Assyrian genocide in 1915, without ever being photographed or copied, so is today lost.

<text>Rockville station is an intermodal train station located in downtown Rockville, Maryland, United States. It is served by the Washington Metro Red Line, MARC Brunswick Line commuter trains, and Amtrak intercity trains.

Rockville station opened in 1873 when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) built their Metropolitan Branch (now the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision). B&amp;O intercity service served the station until 1971; the station continued to be served by commuter trains (which became the Brunswick Line in the 1980s). Amtrak service began in 1973 with the &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, followed by the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; in 1976, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; in 1981, and the &quot;Floridian&quot; in 2024.

The station building, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as Rockville Railroad Station. It was moved slightly to the south in 1981 to make room for Metro construction. The modern Metro station opened on December 15, 1984.

==History==
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) opened its Metropolitan Branch on April 30, 1873, providing direct service to Washington, D.C. from the west. Rockville station opened on May 19, 1873; the convenient access to Washington D.C. caused the town&#x27;s population to more than double by 1890. The station and the 1887-added fright house were designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, head architect of the B&amp;O. Long distance trains did not stop at the station in the B&amp;O era. The first stop on long distance trains out of Washington was Silver Spring station instead.

The station building is among the few original Metropolitan Branch stations to survive. It is a brick Victorian picturesque structure with some Eastlake detailing, particularly in the roofline and gable decoration. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as the Rockville Railroad Station.

When Amtrak took over intercity passenger service on May 1, 1971, it did not include any service on the B&amp;O; Rockville was served only by three daily commuter round trips to Brunswick and Martinsburg. Amtrak introduced the &quot;West Virginian&quot; (later renamed the &quot;Potomac Turbo&quot; and &quot;Potomac Special&quot;) in September 1971; it did not stop at Rockville. The &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; replaced the &quot;Potomac Special&quot; on May 5, 1973. The &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was timed to serve as a commuter train; eastbound-only stops at Rockville and Gaithersburg were added on July 1, 1973. The &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, which stopped at Rockville in both directions, was added on October 31, 1976. The &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; began stopping at Rockville and Gaithersburg in both directions on weekends in 1977. The &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; on October 1, 1981, at which time weekend service ended on the &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; was replaced with the &quot;Floridian&quot; on November 10, 2024.

Construction of a modern station for Amtrak, state-subsidized B&amp;O commuter trains, and the new Washington Metro system began in 1981. On March 2, 1981, the old station and freight house were moved about to the south to make way for construction. The new station opened on December 15, 1984, as part of a , four-station extension of the Red Line from Grosvenor–Strathmore station to Shady Grove station. In 1986, the &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was taken over by MARC as part of the Brunswick Line—the state-subsidized ex-B&amp;O commuter service—leaving the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; as the only Amtrak service to Rockville.

On January 26, 2010, two Metro employees were killed when they were hit by a piece of track equipment at the station. They were installing new train control equipment in the track bed on the outbound track of the Red Line. From September 11, 2021, to January 16, 2022, the Metro station was closed for canopy replacement. On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

==Station layout==

Rockville station is located on an embankment south of Park Road and east of Hungerford Drive and downtown Rockville, with the Amtrak/MARC platforms just east of the Metro platform. Metro uses a single island platform between the two tracks of the Red Line, while Amtrak and MARC use two low-level side platforms flanking the two tracks of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision. A pedestrian underpass provides access to the platforms from parking lots, bus bays, and kiss and ride lots on the east and west sides of the station. A footbridge over Hungerford Drive connects the west side of the station to the Montgomery County office buildings and Rockville Town Center.

<text>Greeting is an act of communication in which human beings intentionally make their presence known to each other, to show attention to, and to suggest a type of relationship (usually cordial) or social status (which formal or informal) between individuals or groups of people coming in contact with each other. Greetings are sometimes used just prior to a conversation or to greet in passing, such as on a sidewalk or trail. While greeting customer are highly culture- and situation-specific and may change within a culture depending on social status and relationship, they exist in all known human cultures. Greetings can be expressed both audibly and physically, and often involve a combination of the two. This topic excludes military and ceremonial salutes but includes rituals other than gestures. A greeting, or salutation, can also be expressed in written communications, such as letters and emails.

Some epochs and cultures have had very elaborate greeting rituals, e.g. greeting a sovereign. Conversely, secret societies have often furtive or arcane greeting gestures that are not always clear or rightly so rituals, such as a secret handshake, which allows members to recognize each other.

In some languages and cultures, the same word or gesture is used as both greeting and farewell. Examples are &quot;Good day&quot; in English, &quot;Drud&quot; in Persian, &quot;Sat Shri is Akaal&quot; in Punjabi, &quot;As-salamu alaykum&quot; in Arabic, &quot;Aloha&quot; in Hawaiian, &quot;Shalom&quot; in Hebrew, &quot;Namaste&quot; in Hindi, &quot;Ayubowan&quot; in Sri Lanka &quot;Sawatdi&quot; in Thai was the name for the &quot;Ciao&quot; in Italian. The bow and handshake are also used for both greeting and leave-taking.

A greeting can consist of an exchange of formal expression, kisses, handshakes, hugs, and various gestures. The form of greeting is determined by social etiquette, as well as by the relationship of the people.

The formal greeting may involve a verbal acknowledgment and sometimes a handshake, but beyond that, facial expression, gestures, body language, and eye contact can all signal what type of greeting is expected. Gestures are the most obvious signal, for instance, greeting someone with open arms is generally a sign that a hug is expected. However, crossing arms can be interpreted as a sign of hostility. The facial expression, body language, and eye contact reflect emotions and interest level. A frown, slouching and lowered eye contact suggests disinterest, while smiling and an exuberant attitude is a sign of welcome.

Many different gestures are used throughout the world as simple greetings. In Western cultures, the handshake is very common, though it has numerous subtle variations in the strength of grip, the vigour of the shake, the dominant position of one hand over the other, and whether or not the left hand is used.

Historically, when men normally wore hats out of doors, male greetings to people they knew, and sometimes those they did not, involved touching, raising slightly (&quot;tipping&quot;), or removing their hat in a variety of gestures. This basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the Middle Ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid-20th century. Hat-raising began with an element of recognition of superiority, where only the socially inferior party might perform it, but gradually lost this element; King Louis XIV of France made a point of at least touching his hat to all women he encountered. However, the gesture was never used by women, for whom their head-covering included considerations of modesty. When a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair to the side of the front of his head to replicate a hat-tipping gesture. This was typically performed by lower classmen to social superiors, such as peasants to the land-owner, and is known as &quot;tugging the forelock&quot;, which still sometimes occurs as a metaphor for submissive behaviour.

The Arabic term &quot;salaam&quot; (literally &quot;peace&quot;, from the spoken greeting that accompanies the gesture), refers to the practice of placing the right palm on the heart, before and after a handshake.

In Moroccan society, same-sex people do not greet each other the same as do opposite sex. While same-sex people (men or women) will shake hands, kiss on the cheek and even hug multiple times, a man and woman greeting each other in public will not go further than a handshake. This is due to Moroccan culture being conservative. Verbal greetings in Morocco can go from a basic salaam, to asking about life details to make sure the other person is doing well. In the kingdom of Morocco, the greeting should always be made with the right hand, as the left hand is traditionally considered unclean.
The most common Chinese greeting, &quot;Gongshou&quot;, features the right fist placed in the palm of the left hand and both shaken back and forth two or three times, it may be accompanied by a head nod or bow. The gesture may be used on meeting and parting, and when congratulating, thanking, or apologizing. 

In India, it is common to see the Namaste greeting (or &quot;Sat Sri Akal&quot; for Sikhs) where the palms of the hands are pressed together and held near the heart with the head gently bowed.

Among Christians in certain parts of the world such as Poland, the greeting phrase &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; has had common usage, especially in the pre-World War II era.

Adab, meaning respect and politeness, is a hand gesture used as a secular greeting in South Asia, especially of Urdu-speaking communities of Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, and Bengal in India, as well as among the Muhajir people of Pakistan. The gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the fingertips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward. It is typical for the person to say &quot;&quot;adab arz hai&quot;, or just &quot;adab&quot;. It is often answered with the same or the word &quot;Tasleem&quot;&quot; is said as an answer or sometimes it is answered with a facial gesture of acceptance.

In Indonesia, a nation with a huge variety of cultures and religions, many greetings are expressed, from the formalized greeting of the highly stratified and hierarchical Javanese to the more egalitarian and practical greetings of outer islands.

Javanese, Batak and other ethnicities currently or formerly involved in the armed forces will salute a government-employed superior, and follow with a deep bow from the waist or short nod of the head and a passing, loose handshake. Hand position is highly important; the superior&#x27;s hand must be higher than the inferior&#x27;s. Muslim men will clasp both hands, palms together at the chest and utter the correct Islamic &quot;slametan&quot; (greeting) phrase, which may be followed by cheek-to-cheek contact, a quick hug or loose handshake. Pious Muslim women rotate their hands from a vertical to the perpendicular prayer-like position in order to barely touch the fingertips of the male greeter and may opt-out of the cheek-to-cheek contact.

If the male is an &quot;Abdi Dalem&quot; royal servant, courtier or particularly &quot;peko-peko&quot; (taken directly from Japanese to mean obsequious) or even a highly formal individual, he will retreat backwards with head downcast, the left arm crossed against the chest and the right arm hanging down, never showing his side or back to his superior. His head must always be lower than that of his superior. Younger Muslim males and females will clasp their elder&#x27;s or superior&#x27;s outstretched hand to the forehead as a sign of respect and obeisance.

If a manual worker or a person with obviously dirty hands salute or greets an elder or superior, he will show deference to his superior and avoid contact by bowing, touching the right forehead in a very quick salute or a distant &quot;slamet&quot; gesture.

The traditional Javanese &quot;Sungkem&quot; involves clasping the palms of both hands together, aligning the thumbs with the nose, turning the head downwards and bowing deeply, bending from the knees. In a royal presence, the one performing &quot;sungkem&quot; would kneel at the base of the throne.

A gesture called a &quot;wai&quot; is used in Thailand, where the hands are placed together palm to palm, approximately at nose level, while bowing. The &quot;wai&quot; is similar in form to the gesture referred to by the Japanese term &quot;gassho&quot; by Buddhists. In Thailand, the men and women would usually press two palms together and bow a little while saying &quot;Sawadee ka&quot; (female speaker) or &quot;Sawadee krap&quot; (male speaker).

===Kisses===

In Europe, the formal style of upper-class greeting used by a man to a woman in the Early Modern Period was to hold the woman&#x27;s presented hand (usually the right) with his right hand and kiss it while bowing. In cases of a low degree of intimacy, the hand is held but not kissed. The ultra-formal style, with the man&#x27;s right knee on the floor, is now only used in marriage proposals, as a romantic gesture.

Cheek kissing is common in Europe, parts of Canada (Quebec) and Latin America and has become a standard greeting mainly in Southern Europe but also in some Central European countries.

While cheek kissing is a common greeting in many cultures, each country has a unique way of kissing. In Russia, Poland, Slovenia, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Iran and Egypt it is customary to &quot;kiss three times, on alternate cheeks&quot;. Italians, Spanish, Hungarian, Romanians, Bosnia-and-Herzegovinans usually kiss twice in a greeting and in Mexico and Belgium only one kiss is necessary. In the Galapagos women kiss on the right cheek only and in Oman, it is not unusual for men to kiss one another on the nose after a handshake. French culture accepts a number of ways to greet depending on the region. Two kisses are most common throughout all of France but in Provence three kisses are given and in Nantes four are exchanged. However, in Finistère at the western tip of Brittany and Deux-Sèvres in the Poitou-Charentes region, one kiss is preferred.

==Spoken greeting==
A spoken greeting or verbal greeting is a customary or ritualised word or phrase used to introduce oneself or to greet someone. Greeting habits are highly culture- and situation-specific and may change within a culture depending on social status.

In English, some common verbal greetings are:

* &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; — General verbal greetings. The latter two are less formal. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first citation of &quot;hey&quot; is found as early as 1225, and is defined as &quot;a call to attract attention . . . an exclamation to express exultation . . . or surprise.&quot; The English language&#x27;s other monosyllabic greeting, &quot;Hi&quot;, is actually much newer, having become popular in the 1920s. Many languages use the word as a greeting, though a variety of spellings exist, including &quot;hei&quot; and &quot;hej&quot;.
* &quot;Good morning&quot;, &quot;good afternoon&quot;, &quot;good evening&quot; — More formal verbal greetings used at the appropriate time of day. The similar &quot;good night&quot; and &quot;good day&quot; are more commonly used as phrases of parting rather than greeting, although in Australian English &quot;G&#x27;day&quot; is a very common greeting.
* &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot;, &quot;How&#x27;s it going?&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s happening?&quot; — informal greetings used frequently
* &quot;How do you do?&quot; Has two usages, depending on the country. For example in Ireland it should be treated as a salutation, whereas in England it should be treated as a question that requires an answer.
* &quot;Howdy&quot; — Informal greeting. Derived from &quot;how do you do,&quot; it is common in the rural regions of the United States.

===Voicemail greetings===
Voicemail greetings are pre-recorded messages that are automatically played to callers when the voicemail system answers the call. Some voicemail systems allow for different greetings to be played to different callers.

== Musical greetings ==
In rural Burundi, familiar women greet each other in a complex interlocking vocal rhythm called akazehe, regardless of the meeting&#x27;s contextual occasion or time.

<doc id="560564" wikidata="Q3234043" url="?curid=560564" title="Shady Grove station">
<text>Shady Grove station is a Washington Metro station in Redland, Maryland, United States. The station opened on December 15, 1984 as part of a four-stop extension of the Red Line from station to Shady Grove. The station is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

Serving as the northwestern terminus of the Red Line, it is the most distant Metro station from downtown Washington, D.C., in Maryland. The station is the location of the Shady Grove Rail Yard, one of the largest storage yards in the Metrorail system.

==Location==

Located in the census-designated place of Redland, the station takes its name from nearby Shady Grove Road to the north. Much of the surrounding area is industrial or low-density residential in nature, although Rockville Road to the south contains strips of commercial activity. To the west is MD 355 (Frederick Road), a continuation of Rockville Pike, which the Red Line parallels throughout much of its route in western Montgomery County; MD 200A connects the Shady Grove station to I-370 and MD 200, better known as the Intercounty Connector. a toll road extending east to I-95.

The station is the northernmost station in the Washington Metro system, and is approximately equidistant from downtown Washington, D.C. and Frederick. Prior to the opening of the Silver Line Extension to Ashburn, it was also the most distant Metro station (by straight-line distance) from the Washington Monument. It still is the most distant in Maryland. The distance from Shady Grove to the Washington Monument is .

===Transit-oriented development===
In order to cope with increasing population growth and subsequent traffic congestion while combating urban sprawl, the Montgomery County Planning Department released the Shady Grove Sector Plan, which aims to act as a guideline for mixed-use growth around the station. The plan emphasises high-density residential and commercial properties within the immediate vicinity of Shady Grove station, with a steady transition to low-density as the distance from the station increases.

The Sector Plan divides the surrounding area into five districts: Metro North, Metro East, Metro West, Metro South, and Jeremiah Park. Combined, there will be over 6,000 residential units within walking distance of Shady Grove station. In addition, the plan encourages the creation of a walkable street grid with defined main streets integrated with a comprehensive open space and park system.

==History==
The station opened on December 15, 1984 as part of a , four-station northwestern extension of the Red Line between Grosvenor–Strathmore and Shady Grove stations. In 1967, during the initial planning for the Washington Metro, it was nearby Germantown and not Shady Grove was considered for the western terminus of the Red Line.

In 1996, this station was the site of the Washington Metro&#x27;s second fatal accident when a train arriving at the station overshot the platform and collided with a parked train awaiting assignment, killing the operator of the moving train. The Washington Post reported that the striking train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance. A degradation of brake performance could have played a role in the crash. The crash, which occurred during the Blizzard of 1996, was caused by a failure in the train&#x27;s Automatic Train Control system.

In 2011, as part of a preliminary study, the WMATA examined the possibility of extending the Red Line past the Shady Grove station and to the Metropolitan Grove station by 2040.

From September 11, 2021 to January 16, 2022, this station was closed due to the Rockville Canopy Replacement Project at Rockville station.

==Station layout==
The station has one island platform located west of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, which carry Amtrak and MARC Trains. There is extensive parking available at this station: a surface lot to the west, and two garages and two surface lots to the east. Access between the platform and parking areas is provided by underpass, located at ground level on the east side and a short escalator below ground level on the west side. Each side of the station also contains a small kiss and ride lot.

<text>Pontefract cakes (also known as Pomfret cakes and Pomfrey cakes) are a type of small, roughly circular black sweet measuring approximately wide and thick, made of liquorice, originally manufactured in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, England.

==Name==

The original name for these small tablets of liquorice is a &quot;Pomfret&quot; cake, after the old Norman name for Pontefract. However, that name has fallen into disuse and they are now almost invariably labelled &quot;Pontefract cakes&quot;. The term &quot;cake&quot; has a long history. The word itself is of Germanic origin, from the Germanic &quot;kakâ&quot; (cook).

==History==
The exact origins of liquorice growing in England remain uncertain. However, by the 16th century there is record of the activity, possibly via monastic gardens and as a garden crop for the gentry. During the 17th century it was recorded as being grown in areas with alluvial soil overlying magnesian limestone such as in Surrey, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; of 1607 noted the crop in Worksop and Pontefract. By 1780 liquorice growing was concentrated almost wholly in Pontefract and in Surrey, around Godalming.

In Pontefract the growing of liquorice was done on plots of land behind people&#x27;s houses. In a map of the 1648 Siege of Pontefract (reproduced by Chartres) the liquorice is indicated as being grown in &quot;garths&quot; either side of Micklegate, the street which runs between Pontefract&#x27;s Market Place and the castle.

In the 18th century liquorice was used as a medicine both for humans and for horses. The Pontefract cake &quot;was almost certainly a black cake, the portable lozenge used to make &#x27;liquorish water&#x27;, stamped with the castle lodge emblem of Pontefract to signify quality. This trade mark had been employed on Pontefract cakes since 1612, when the initials &#x27;GS&#x27; were used, and are thought to be those of Sir George Savile, major local landowner; and a second die-stamp from 1720.&quot; It was only in the 19th century that it was used extensively for confectionery. Of the merchants in the 18th century, apothecary chemist George Dunhill (later bought by German confectioner Haribo) was the most important. In 1760, Dunhill added sugar to the medicinal liquorice; he was also a grower of liquorice. It was not until 1810, that Firth Confectioners (eventually known as Ewbanks) joined Dunhill in producing sweet liquorice.

With the growth of Pontefract cakes as confectionery the demand for liquorice outstripped the capacity of Pontefract growers to supply. By the late 19th century the 12 firms producing liquorice confectionery relied mainly on extract imported largely from Turkey.

==Production and design==
Originally, the sweets were embossed by hand with a stamp, to form their traditional look (the workers who did this were known as &quot;cakers&quot; and were able to produce upwards of 30,000 per day), but now they are usually machinery formed. The embossed stamp was originally a stylised image of Pontefract Castle with a raven on the top bar, which is thought to have been in use for almost 400 years. When the first secret ballot in the United Kingdom was held in Pontefract on 15 August 1872, the ballot box used was sealed using a Pontefract cake stamp from Frank Dunhill&#x27;s factory, which shows the image of a castle and an owl.

==Health warning==
In 2004, healthcare professionals warned against overindulgence in Pontefract cake after a 56-year-old woman was admitted to hospital following an overdose. The woman consumed about daily, leading to dangerously low potassium levels and subsequent muscle failure. Earlier in 2004, the European Commission had recommended limiting consumption of the active ingredient, glycyrrhizic acid, to 100 mg or less per day.

==Literary references==
In Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s 1866 novel &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot;, Mr Gibson, the local doctor and one of the main characters, has the following exchange with the father of one of his apprentices:

&quot;Must my boy make the pills himself then?&quot; asked the major ruefully.

&quot;To be sure. The youngest apprentice always does. It&#x27;s not hard work. He&#x27;ll have the comfort of thinking he won&#x27;t have to swallow them himself. And he&#x27;ll have the run of the pomfret cakes, and the conserve of hips, and on Sundays he shall have a taste of tamarinds to reward him for his weekly labour at pill making.&quot;

<text>The Austin Ambassador is a large family car that was introduced by the Austin Rover Group subsidiary of British Leyland in March 1982. The vehicle was a heavily updated version of the Princess, a saloon car that had lacked a hatchback, the car that &quot;the Princess should have been right from the word go&quot; according to one company manager. British Leyland changed the name to underscore the depths of the changes - only the doors and inner structure were carried over, but the wedge-shaped side profile betrayed the car&#x27;s Princess origins, and buyers did not consider it a truly new model. The Princess had been out of production for four months by the time that the Ambassador went on sale.

To some extent a car that bridged the gap between the smaller Morris Ital and the Rover SD1, sales were low and the model was discontinued in 1984 with 43,427 cars built.

==Design==
Unlike the Princess, a six-cylinder 2.2-litre version was not available; the Ambassador was offered only as a four-cylinder, initially with either a 1.7-litre or a 2.0-litre variant in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;HL&quot;, &quot;HLS&quot;, and &quot;Vanden Plas&quot; trims. The single carburettor, 1.7-litre engine generates at 5200 rpm, while the 2.0-litre engine delivers at 4900 rpm. In the HLS and Vanden Plas trims, the Ambassador was equipped with a 2.0-litre engine sporting twin carburettors - this replaced the earlier &quot;six&quot; and allowed a power increase to with torque measuring . A benefit of not having to accommodate the taller E6 engine was that the bonnet could be made lower and flatter, although this meant that the wipers were now no longer concealed (unlike those of the Princess). In 1983, the 2.0-litre HL was upgraded to also use the more powerful twin-carburettor engine. A four-speed manual gearbox (and automatic) were the only transmissions offered, with commentators citing the lack of a fifth gear (available in other BL models) for the manual transmission, as one of the car&#x27;s drawbacks.

Despite prototypes being built in left-hand drive, production versions of the Ambassador were only built in right-hand drive form and thus were not exported to continental Europe. Just 14 Ambassadors remain taxed and on the roads in Britain in 2023, out of 43,500 built; compared to around 225,000 for the Princess. As of 2023, 338 Princesses remain in active service in the UK with a MOT. Aside from the Ambassador&#x27;s connections to the lowly repute of the Princess, commentators point out that its sedate image and driving characteristics (and low performance) also mitigate against its success in a market where performance and taut handling were becoming more important.

Some components, such as the headlights, were shared with the Morris Ital. Other minor components, including much of the interior trim, was also shared with other BL products, such as the Allegro. The redesigned interior was generally not considered an improvement over that of the Princess, feeling cheap and lacking a rev counter – even in the top HLS model. According to British Leyland, only the front door skins were directly shared with the Princess. The rear part of the chassis was modified to accommodate the opening hatch, and there were windows in the C-pillars which did make for an airier cabin.

The Ambassador only served as a stop-gap in the Austin range, being discontinued in March 1984 (after exactly two years in production), with no official replacement. The gap it left in the Austin-Rover range was effectively filled by the slightly smaller Montego, and by lower-specced versions of the new Rover 800 series.

==Sales==
The Ambassador achieved domestic sales of 43,427 in the two years in which it was available.

<doc id="560576" wikidata="Q1365010" url="?curid=560576" title="Tallinn TV Tower">
<text>Tallinn TV Tower () is a free-standing structure with an observation deck, built to provide better telecommunication services for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics regatta event (see Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics). It is located near the suburb Pirita, six km north-east of the Tallinn city center. With its 313 m (1030.2 ft), the TV tower is the tallest nonbuilding structure in Tallinn. The tower was officially opened on 11 July 1980. The viewing platform at a height of 170 metres was open to the public until 26 November 2007, when it was closed for renovation. The tower began receiving visitors again on 5 April 2012. The building is administered by the public company Levira (formerly Estonian Broadcasting Transmission Center Ltd) and is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers.

The architects were David Baziladze and Juri Sinis, the engineers Vladimir Obydov and Yevgeny Ignatov. The construction work was supervised by Aleksander Ehala.

The cornerstone was laid on 30 September 1975, and the building was inaugurated 11 July 1980 (although the first transmission took place in 1979). The tower body was constructed of reinforced concrete rings 50 cm thick that weigh a total of 17,000 tonnes, and the total tower weight is approximately 20,000 tonnes. The tower survived a fire during construction.

The observation deck on the 21st floor, originally designed to have a rotating section, is located 170 m above ground and has a diameter of 38 m. The tower was closed to the public on 26 November 2007. Before it was closed, tickets were priced at 60 Estonian kroon and, aside from an infrequently used concrete and metal staircase, the observation deck was accessed by two elevators. The Vilnius TV tower has a similar architectural design but features a rotating observation deck 165 m above ground.

The structure consists of a 190-metre reinforced concrete tower and a 124-metre metal mast on top of it. Under the tower is a two-storey building with equipment rooms, entrance halls and a conference centre. The diameter of the tower at its base is 15.2 metres and the wall thickness is 50 cm. The diameter of the tower from 140 metres up is 8.2 metres. A total of 10,000 m3 of concrete and 1,900 tonnes of steel were used in the construction.

The Tallinn TV tower was reopened on 5 April 2012 with completely new interior design made by KOKO Arhitektid.

Local guide books advertise the observation deck&#x27;s views of Tallinn and extending to the Gulf of Finland. The tower is described as having a 1980s Soviet feel and a restaurant is located on the observation floor. Bullet holes dating from the Soviet coup attempt of 1991 are still visible at the base of the tower.

==1991 defense of Estonia==
A widely known account tells of a handful of radio operators who in 1991 risked their lives to protect the free media of the reborn Republic of Estonia from Soviet troops. The defenders placed a matchbox between the elevator door and frame in such a manner that the elevator wouldn&#x27;t work, leaving the approximately 1,000 tower steps as the only route to the top for the Soviets. The operators also had an oxygen-removing fire-fighting system at their disposal. Triggering the system would have asphyxiated everyone in the tower, including the defenders themselves. However, it is not known if the system was operational or if the threat to deploy it was a bluff. The story is well known in Estonia; it is also part of the movie &quot;August 1991&quot; and is mentioned at length in the documentary &quot;The Singing Revolution&quot;.

==Tallinn TV tower&#x27;s structural features==
Thirty-two building enterprises participated in the construction of the Tallinn TV tower. The TV tower was designed by specialists at the State Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications in Moscow. The chief engineer was Yevgeny Ignatov, the chief designer was Vladimir Obydov and the architects were Juri Sinis and David Basiladze.

The team faced two challenges: to choose a suitable tower structure and select the best location for it. The structure selected was a freely supported base part from reinforced concrete and steel upper part serving as the antenna, with a total height of 314 metres. The internal space of such a TV tower made from reinforced concrete is sufficient for installation of all the necessary equipment and addition of a viewing platform with a restaurant, accessed via a high-speed lift. The height of the tower is such that it is capable of transmitting excellent radio and television signals to distances of up to 90 kilometres in ideal weather conditions.

Several factors were taken into account for the location: the required distance from densely populated urban areas to ensure proper signal reception, geological features of the local soil, distance from the airport, and impact on Tallinn&#x27;s skyline. The chosen spot was 8 kilometres from the city centre, in a rest and recreation zone not far from the botanical garden and a motor sports club. The location is 23 metres above sea level. The tower, clearly visible from the city and from the sea, dominates the surrounding landscape and affects the local architecture.

The structure of the tower can be divided into three sections: the foundation, the tower itself from reinforced concrete (190 m) and the steel antenna (124 m). From 150–182 metres the tower contains a superstructure that is 38 metres in diameter, housing the viewing platform, the restaurant and the equipment room for commercial radio stations. The two-storey building that surrounds the base of the tower is also 38 metres in diameter and contains technical and auxiliary facilities.
The foundation slab made from reinforced concrete is 38 metres in diameter, 2.5 metres thick and buried 8.5 metres below ground level. This slab supports a tower of reinforced concrete that is 15.2 metres in diameter at the base and only 8.2 metres in diameter at a height of 180 metres. The wall thickness in the lower part is 500 mm and 350 mm in the upper part; this is to ensure tower stability even in strong storm conditions. Before 1967 all tall structures had been built in Estonia in compliance with the safety requirements applicable to structures situated in areas with the second wind strength level. After a storm in 1967, with the wind speed reaching 42 metres per second, the TV tower was designed in compliance with the fourth wind strength level requirements.

The mass total of the tower is over 20,000 tons. The centre of gravity of the structure is in the base of the tower, which is why it could not fall over even if the foundation slab were on the surface of the ground.

The general contractor was the Tallinn Construction Trust and the subcontractors were the Reinforced Concrete Construction Trust, the Metal Structures Trust and the Radio Construction Trust. The work was commissioned by the TV Tower Construction Directorate of the Ministry of Communications of the Estonian SSR, with Vootele Tõsine as its director.

==Construction work==
Several new technical solutions were implemented during the construction of the TV tower. The reinforced concrete tower itself was assembled using the sliding mold method. The concrete mold was installed at a height of 2.5 metres; then the armature was inserted and the concrete poured. After that the concrete form was shifted upwards, narrowed to the new diameter and the new section of reinforced concrete created. Today the rings resulting from this process can still be seen at 2.5-metre intervals on the tower. The concrete was poured continuously for 8 months, with the tower gradually rising above the landscape. The builders used M-400 concrete based on oil shale ash and Portland cement. This concrete had been developed by the scientists at the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute under the supervision of Verner Kikas. The concrete was designed to withstand 300 frost resistance cycles. Subsequent inspections have revealed that the strength of this concrete is even higher than stipulated.

The antenna part of the structure is made from steel cylinders. The metal antenna was installed using the ejection method. At first a smaller-diameter cylinder was lifted to the necessary spot; then over it was placed a larger-diameter cylinder and the smaller cylinder was pushed up through it with blocks and winches. The assembly was completed by attaching to each cylinder the television and ultra short-wave transmitter vibrators.
The upper metal framework, weighing over 120 tons, was assembled on the ground around the base of the tower and then raised to 170 metres. From start to finish all building work was supervised by foreman Aleksander Ehala and team master Väino Saar. They often had to solve complicated problems and the designers always agreed with their solutions.

The TV tower is regularly checked for geodetic compliance: foundation settling, vertical deviation, condition of reinforced concrete and metal components, and other parameters. The allowed sway of the top of the TV tower due to wind is 1.5 metres; of the viewing platform, 90 cm. Besides winds, the tower is affected by solar heating, resulting in the top “drawing” a peculiar curve.

The steel part, from 190 m to 260 m, has a lift for two persons and hatches for access to the external platforms for the purpose of inspection and repairs of the antenna equipment. In the tower below the antenna section there is also a staircase with 1,050 steps from the basement to a height of 190 metres.

==Important dates==

*4 April 2012 – the renovated tower welcomes new visitors

==Incidents at the TV tower==

In April 1980 team master Saar prevented a major construction accident. A welder&#x27;s negligence had caused the cables in the tower shaft to catch fire. The draught was strong because the structure acted like a giant chimney. The fire thus progressed quickly up the tower from the point of origin on the 5th storey. Saar managed to outrace the conflagration and cut the cables on the 23rd storey, thus preventing the fire from reaching the metal part of the tower. Had the antenna structure been subjected to heat from the fire, it might have collapsed. The fire damage was repaired within one month.

Over the decades the antenna equipment on the TV tower underwent a major overhaul. Due to the introduction of the FM waveband the radio antennas were rebuilt. But an accident ensued during installation of a 12-metre pipe-shaped antenna for the 45th television channel transmitter at the very tip of the tower. Jüri Makarov was a prominent local businessman who created a new television station, Tipp TV, and that included installation on the TV tower of an Italian-made transmitter for the channel. The corresponding antenna, a 12-metre pipe, had been purchased in the United States, and Makarov arranged to install it with the aid of a helicopter commissioned from St. Petersburg. The helicopter successfully removed an old radio antenna from the top of the tower. In the early morning on 19 May 1994 the helicopter took off with the new antenna. The helicopter, with the antenna suspended under it on a cable, attempted to manoeuvre to insert the end of the antenna into its slot. The wind was disruptive, its force reaching 8. When the antenna touched the tower, the pilots mistakenly assumed that it had gone into the slot and released the cable. The falling antenna hit the restaurant roof and grazed the railing. The roof of the viewing platform and its windows shattered. The antenna itself broke as well. A new antenna was later sent and specialists successfully installed it under the supervision of leading engineer Vitali Lonkin. Saar oversaw the repairs to the restaurant roof.

<text>The Baku TV Tower (), built in 1996, is a free standing concrete telecommunications tower in Baku, Azerbaijan. With a height of 310 metres (1017 ft or 480 meters from Caspian sea level), it is the tallest structure in Azerbaijan and the tallest reinforced concrete building in Caucasus.

The tower has become one of the most prominent landmarks of Baku, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city.

==History==
The TV tower was designed on the basis of the decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR after the order from the Ministry of Communications of Azerbaijan State Institute of the Ministry of Communications of the USSR. Construction work began in 1979 and according to the project construction plan it should have been completed in 1985. After the return of Heydar Aliyev to power in 1993, the construction of the tower was continued, and in 1996 with his participation, the official opening ceremony of the complex was carried.

A rotating restaurant on the 62nd floor (175 metres) of Azeri TV Tower was opened in 2008.

== Appearance ==
Occasionally, Baku TV Tower&#x27;s lighting is changed to specific, unique arrangements for special events. Some annual events are cause for the tower to be specially lit. Such as alternating sections of the tower were lit to blue, red and green like in traditional Azerbaijani flag to help celebrate the national holidays. The tower has also had a variety of special lighting arrangements for New Year since 2004.

<doc id="560587" wikidata="Q478202" url="?curid=560587" title="The Merry Widow">
<text>The Merry Widow ( ) is an operetta by the Austro-Hungarian composer Franz Lehár. The librettists, Viktor Léon and Leo Stein, based the story – concerning a rich widow, and her countrymen&#x27;s attempt to keep her money in the principality by finding her the right husband – on an 1861 comedy play, (&quot;The Embassy Attaché&quot;) by Henri Meilhac.

The operetta has enjoyed extraordinary international success since its 1905 premiere in Vienna and continues to be frequently revived and recorded. Film and other adaptations have also been made. Well-known music from the score includes the &quot;Vilja Song&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;ll Find Me at Maxim&#x27;s&quot;), and the &quot;Merry Widow Waltz&quot;.

==Background==

In 1861, Henri Meilhac premiered a comic play in Paris, (&quot;The Embassy Attaché&quot;), in which the Parisian ambassador of a poor German grand duchy, Baron Scharpf, schemes to arrange a marriage between his country&#x27;s richest widow (a French woman) and a Count to keep her money at home, thus preventing economic disaster in the duchy. The play was soon adapted into German as &quot;Der Gesandschafts-Attaché&quot; (1862) and was given several successful productions. In early 1905, Viennese librettist Leo Stein came across the play and thought it would make a good operetta. He suggested this to one of his writing collaborators, Viktor Léon and to the manager of the Theater an der Wien, who was eager to produce the piece. The two adapted the play as a libretto and updated the setting to contemporary Paris, expanding the plot to reference an earlier relationship between the widow (this time a countrywoman) and the Count, and moving the native land from a dour German province to a colourful little Balkan state. In addition, the widow admits to an affair to protect the Baron&#x27;s wife, and the Count&#x27;s haven is changed to the Parisian restaurant and nightclub Maxim&#x27;s. They asked Richard Heuberger to compose the music, as he had a previous hit at the Theater an der Wien with a Parisian-themed piece, &quot;Der Opernball&quot; (1898). He composed a draft of the score, but it was unsatisfactory, and he gladly left the project.

The theatre&#x27;s staff next suggested that Franz Lehár might compose the piece. Lehár had worked with Léon and Stein on &quot;Der Göttergatte&quot; the previous year. Although Léon doubted that Lehár could invoke an authentic Parisian atmosphere, he was soon enchanted by Lehar&#x27;s first number for the piece, a bubbly galop melody for &quot;Dummer, dummer Reitersmann&quot;. The score of &quot;Die Lustige Witwe&quot; was finished in a matter of months. The theatre engaged Mizzi Günther and Louis Treumann for the leading roles. They had starred as the romantic couple in other operettas in Vienna, including a production of &quot;Der Opernball&quot; and a previous Léon and Lehár success, &quot;Der Rastelbinder&quot; (1902). Both stars were so enthusiastic about the piece that they supplemented the theatre&#x27;s low-budget production by paying for their own lavish costumes. During the rehearsal period, the theatre lost faith in the score and asked Lehár to withdraw it, but he refused. The piece was given little rehearsal time on stage before its premiere.

==Original production==
&quot;Die Lustige Witwe&quot; was first performed at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna on 30 December 1905, with Günther as Hanna, Treumann as Danilo, Siegmund Natzler as Baron Zeta and Annie Wünsch as Valencienne. After a couple of shaky weeks at the box-office, it became a major success, receiving good reviews and running for 483 performances. The production also toured in Austria in 1906. 

The operetta originally had no overture; Lehár wrote one for the 400th performance, but it is rarely used in productions of the operetta, as the original short introduction is preferred. The Vienna Philharmonic performed the overture at Lehár&#x27;s 70th birthday concert in April 1940.

==Roles and original cast==

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
The embassy in Paris of the poverty-stricken Balkan principality of Pontevedro is holding a ball to celebrate the birthday of the sovereign, the Grand Duke. Hanna Glawari, who has inherited twenty million francs from her late husband, is to be a guest at the ball – and the Pontevedrin ambassador, Baron Zeta, is scheming to ensure that she will keep her fortune in the country, saving Pontevedro from bankruptcy. The Baron intends that Count Danilo Danilovitsch, the first secretary of the embassy, should marry the widow; unfortunately for this plan, Danilo is not at the party, so Zeta sends Danilo&#x27;s assistant Njegus to fetch him from Maxim&#x27;s.

Danilo arrives and meets Hanna. It emerges they were in love before her marriage, but his uncle had interrupted their romance because Hanna had had nothing to her name. Though they still love each other, Danilo now refuses to court Hanna for her fortune, and Hanna vows that she will not marry him until he says &quot;I love you&quot; – something he claims he will never do.

Meanwhile, Baron Zeta&#x27;s wife Valencienne has been flirting with the French attaché to the embassy, Count Camille de Rosillon, who writes &quot;I love you&quot; on her fan. Valencienne puts off Camille&#x27;s advances, saying that she is a respectable wife. However, they lose the incriminating fan, which is found by embassy counsellor Kromow. Kromow jealously fears that the fan belongs to his own wife, Olga, and gives it to Baron Zeta. Not recognising it, Baron Zeta decides to return the fan discreetly, in spite of Valencienne&#x27;s desperate offers to take it &quot;to Olga&quot; herself.

On his way to find Olga, the Baron meets Danilo, and his diplomatic mission takes precedence over the fan. The Baron orders Danilo to marry Hanna. Danilo refuses, but offers to eliminate any non-Pontevedrin suitors as a compromise.

As the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Choice&quot; dance is about to begin, Hanna becomes swarmed with hopeful suitors. Valencienne volunteers Camille to dance with Hanna, privately hoping that the Frenchman will marry her and cease to be a temptation for Valencienne herself. True to his bargain with the Baron, Danilo circulates the ballroom, rounding up ladies to claim dances and thin the crowd around the wealthy widow. Hanna, however, chooses the one man who is not apparently interested in dancing with her: Danilo, who immediately announces that he will sell his dance with Hanna Glawari for ten thousand francs, with the proceeds to benefit charity. This extinguishes the remaining suitors&#x27; interest in the dance. After they have left, Danilo attempts to dance with Hanna, who refuses in annoyance. Nonchalantly he proceeds to waltz by himself, eventually wearing down Hanna&#x27;s resistance, and she falls into his arms.

===Act 2===
====Scene 1====
The next evening, everyone is dressed in Pontevedrin clothing for a garden party at Hanna&#x27;s house, now celebrating the Grand Duke&#x27;s birthday in his own country&#x27;s fashion. Hanna entertains by singing an old Pontevedrin song: &quot;&quot; (&quot;There lived a Vilja, a maid of the woods&quot;). Meanwhile, Baron Zeta fears that Camille will spoil his plan for Hanna to marry a Pontevedrin. Still not recognising the fan as Valencienne&#x27;s, the Baron orders Danilo to discover the identity of its owner, whom he correctly assumes to be Camille&#x27;s married lover. The two men, along with Njegus, arrange to meet that evening in Hanna&#x27;s garden pavilion to discuss Danilo&#x27;s findings, as well as the problem of securing the widow&#x27;s fortune for Pontevedro. Seeing the fan, Hanna takes the message on it to be Danilo&#x27;s declaration of love for her, which he denies. His inquiries regarding the fan prove fruitless, but do reveal infidelities committed by some of the wives of embassy personnel.

====Scene 2====
That evening, Camille and Valencienne meet in the garden, where Valencienne insists that they must part. Discovering the fan, accidentally left behind by Danilo, Camille begs Valencienne to let him have it as a . Valencienne agrees, writing &quot;I&#x27;m a respectable wife&quot; on it as a rejoinder to Camille&#x27;s &quot;I love you.&quot; Camille persuades Valencienne to join him in the pavilion so that they can say their goodbyes in private. This is of course the same pavilion where Danilo, the Baron, and Njegus have agreed to meet, and the latter, arriving first, locks the door when he spots people inside. Baron Zeta and Danilo follow, but Njegus quickly arranges with Hanna to change places with Valencienne. Camille emerges from the pavilion with Hanna, who announces that they plan to marry, leaving the Baron distraught at the thought of Pontevedro losing Hanna&#x27;s millions and Valencienne distraught at losing Camille. Danilo is furious, and tells the story of a Princess who cheated on her Prince (&quot;)&quot; before storming off to seek distraction at Maxim&#x27;s. Hanna realises that Danilo&#x27;s anger over her engagement to another man proves that he loves her, and she rejoices amid the general despair.

===Act 3===
Act 3 is set at a theme party in Hanna&#x27;s ballroom, which she has decorated to look like Maxim&#x27;s, complete with Maxim&#x27;s grisettes (can-can dancers). Valencienne, who has dressed herself as a grisette, entertains the guests (&quot;). When Danilo arrives, having found the real Maxim&#x27;s empty, he tells Hanna to give up Camille for the sake of Pontevedro. Much to Danilo&#x27;s delight, Hanna replies truthfully that she was never engaged to Camille but was protecting the reputation of a married woman. Danilo comes very close to declaring his love for Hanna, but stops himself from doing so when he remembers her money and his proud refusal to court her for it. Njegus produces the fan, which he picked up earlier, and Baron Zeta finally remembers that it belongs to Valencienne. He swears to divorce his wife and marry the widow himself, but Hanna stops him by declaring that she will lose her fortune if she remarries. At this, Danilo promptly confesses his love for her and asks Hanna to marry him. Hanna triumphantly accepts, adding that she will lose her fortune only because it will become the property of her new husband. Valencienne assures Baron Zeta of her fidelity by pointing out her reply to Camille&#x27;s declaration of love written on the fan: &quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m a respectable wife&quot;). All ends happily.

==Subsequent productions==
The operetta was produced in 1906 in Hamburg&#x27;s Neues Operetten-Theater, Berlin&#x27;s with Max Monti&#x27;s company before Monti moved the production to the Theater des Westens (Gustav Matzner as Danilo and Marie Ottmann as Hanna starred and, with the Berlin cast in 1907, made the work&#x27;s first complete recording, including dialogue, for Deutsche Grammophon), and Budapest&#x27;s Magyar Színház in a faithful Hungarian translation. The piece became an international sensation, and translations were quickly made into various languages: in 1907, Buenos Aires theatres were playing at least five productions, each in a different language. Productions also swiftly followed in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Milan, Moscow and Madrid, among other places. It was eventually produced in every city with a theatre industry. Bernard Grün, in his book &quot;Gold and Silver: The Life and Times of Franz Lehar&quot;, estimates that &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; was performed about half a million times in its first sixty years. Global sheet music sales and recordings totalled tens of millions of dollars. Its popularity influenced fashions and inspired merchandising and product tie-ins, from corsets to chocolates. According to theatre writer John Kenrick, no other play or musical up to the 1960s had enjoyed such international commercial success.

===English adaptations===
In its English adaptation by Basil Hood, with lyrics by Adrian Ross, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; became a sensation at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in London, opening on 8 June 1907, starring Lily Elsie and Joseph Coyne and featuring George Graves as the Baron, Robert Evett as Camille and W. H. Berry as Nisch, with costumes by Lucile and Percy Anderson. Gabrielle Ray was a replacement as the Maxim&#x27;s dancer Frou-Frou. It was produced by George Edwardes. The production ran for an extraordinary 778 performances in London and toured extensively in Great Britain.

The adaptation renamed many of the characters, to avoid offense to Montenegro, where the royal family&#x27;s surname was Njegus, the crown prince was named Danilo, and Zeta was the principal founding state. Hood changed the name of the principality to Marsovia, Danilo is promoted to the title of Prince, Hannah is Sonia, the Baron is Popoff, Njegus is Nisch, Camille&#x27;s surname is de Jolidon and Valencienne is Natalie, among other changes. The final scene was relocated into Maxim&#x27;s itself, rather than the original theme-party setting, to take further advantage of the fame of the nightclub. Graves ad-libbed extensive &quot;business&quot; in the role of the Baron. Edwardes engaged Lehár to write two new songs, one of which, &quot;Quite Parisien&quot; (a third act solo for Nisch) is still used in some productions. Lehár also made changes for a Berlin production in the 1920s, but the definitive version of the score is basically that of the original production.
The first American production opened on 21 October 1907 at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway for another very successful run of 416 performances, and was reproduced by multiple touring companies across the US, all using the Hood/Ross libretto. It was produced by Henry Wilson Savage. The New York cast starred Ethel Jackson as Sonia and Donald Brian as Danilo. The operetta first played in Australia in 1908 using the Hood/Ross libretto. Since then, it has been staged frequently in English. It was revived in London&#x27;s West End in 1923, running for 239 performances, and in 1924 and 1932. A 1943 revival ran for 302 performances. Most of these productions featured Graves as Popoff. Madge Elliott and Cyril Ritchard starred in the 1944 production, while June Bronhill and Thomas Round led the 1958 cast and recording. Lizbeth Webb and John Rhys Evans starred in a brief 1969 revival. Revivals were mounted in major New York theatres in 1921, 1929, 1931 and 1943–1944. The last of these starred Marta Eggerth and her husband Jan Kiepura, with sets by Howard Bay and choreography by George Balanchine. It ran for 322 performances at the Majestic Theatre and returned the next season at the New York City Center for another 32 performances.

Glocken Verlag Ltd, London, published two different English translation editions in 1958. One English-language libretto is by Phil Park, which was adapted and arranged by Ronald Hanmer. The other is by Christopher Hassall, based on the edition by Ludwig Doblinger, Vienna. The Park version is a whole-tone lower than the original. Danilo and Hanna&#x27;s hummed waltz theme becomes a chorus number, and the ending of the &quot;Rosebud Romance&quot; is sung mostly in unison rather than as a conversation. In the Hassall version, the action of act 3 takes place at Maxim&#x27;s. Valencienne and the other Embassy wives arrive to seek out Danilo and convince him to return to Hanna, closely followed by their husbands, seeking to achieve the same purpose. The Grisettes, Parisian cabaret girls, make a grand entrance, led by the voluptuous ZoZo. Zeta finds the brokenhearted Danilo, and as they argue, Hanna enters. Hanna, Danilo and Zeta separately bribe the Maitre&#x27;d to clear the room so Hanna and Danilo can be alone. Danilo sets aside his pride and asks Hanna to give up Camille for the sake of the country. Much to Danilo&#x27;s delight, Hanna tells him that she was never engaged to Camille, but that she was protecting the reputation of a married woman. Danilo is ready to declare his love for Hanna, and is on the point of doing so when he remembers her money, and stops himself. When Njegus produces the fan, which he had picked up earlier, Baron Zeta suddenly realizes that the fan belongs to Valencienne. Baron Zeta swears to divorce his wife and marry the widow himself, but Hanna tells him that she loses her fortune if she remarries. Hearing this, Danilo confesses his love for her and asks Hanna to marry him, and Hanna triumphantly points out that she will lose her fortune only because it will become the property of her husband. Valencienne produces the fan and assures Baron Zeta of her fidelity by reading out what she had replied to Camille&#x27;s declaration: &quot;I&#x27;m a highly respectable wife&quot;.

In the 1970s, the Light Opera of Manhattan, a year-round professional light opera repertory company in New York City, commissioned Alice Hammerstein Mathias, the daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II, to create a new English adaptation, which was revived many times until the company closed at the end of the 1980s. Essgee Entertainment staged productions of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; in capital cities around Australia during 1998 and 1999. A prologue was added featuring a narrative by Jon English and a ballet introducing the earlier romance of Anna and Danilo. The production opened in Brisbane, with Jeffrey Black as Danilo, Helen Donaldson as &quot;Anna&quot;, Simon Gallaher as Camille and English as Baron Zeta. In some performances, during the production&#x27;s Brisbane run, Jason Barry-Smith appeared as Danilo. In Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide in 1999, John O&#x27;May appeared as Danilo, Marina Prior as &quot;Hanna&quot;, Max Gillies as Zeta, Gallaher as Camille and Donaldson as Valencienne.

Numerous opera companies have mounted the operetta. New York City Opera mounted several productions from the 1950s through the 1990s, including a lavish 1977 production starring Beverly Sills and Alan Titus with a new translation by Sheldon Harnick. An Australian Opera production starred Joan Sutherland, and PBS broadcast a production by the San Francisco Opera in 2002, among numerous other broadcasts. The Metropolitan Opera had mounted the opera 18 times by 2003. The first performance by The Royal Opera in London was in 1997.

===French, German, and Italian versions===
The first production in Paris was at the Théâtre Apollo on 28 April 1909 as &quot;La Veuve joyeuse&quot;. Although Parisians were worried about how their city would be portrayed in the operetta, the Paris production was well received and ran for 186 performances. In this translation, Hanna is an American raised in &quot;Marsovie&quot; named &quot;Missia&quot;. Danilo was a prince with gambling debts. The third act was set in Maxim&#x27;s. The following year, the operetta played in Brussels.

&quot;The Merry Widow&quot; is frequently revived in Vienna and is part of the Vienna Volksopera&#x27;s repertory. The Volksopera released a complete live performance on CD, interpolating the &quot;Can-Can&quot; from Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;, which was copied in many other productions worldwide. Best known as Danilo in the German version was the actor Johannes Heesters, who played the part thousands of times for over thirty years.

The operetta has also been translated into Italian (as &quot;La Vedova Allegra&quot;).

==Recordings==
The operetta has been recorded both live and in the studio many times, and several video recordings have been made. In 1906, the original Hanna and Danilo, Mizzi Günther and Louis Treumann, recorded their arias and duets, and also some numbers written for Camille and Valencienne; CD transfers were made in 2005. The first recording of a substantially complete version of the score was made of the Berlin 1907 production, with Ottmann and Matzner in their lead roles and Bruno Seidler-Winkler conducting the &quot;Grammophon Streich-Orchester&quot;; it includes a considerable amount of the operetta&#x27;s dialogue. After that, excerpts appeared periodically on disc, but no new full recording was issued until 1950, when Columbia Records released a set sung in English with Dorothy Kirsten and Robert Rounseville.

In 1953, EMI&#x27;s Columbia label released a near-complete version produced by Walter Legge, conducted by Otto Ackermann, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Hanna, Erich Kunz as Danilo, Nicolai Gedda as Camille and Emmy Loose as Valencienne. It was sung in German, with abridged spoken dialogue. Loose sang Valencienne again for Decca in the first stereophonic recording, produced in 1958 by John Culshaw, with Hilde Gueden, Per Grundén and Waldemar Kmentt in the other main roles, and the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Robert Stolz. A second recording with Schwarzkopf as Hanna was issued by Columbia in 1963; the other main roles were sung by Eberhard Wächter, Gedda and Hanny Steffek. This set, conducted by Lovro von Matačić, has been reissued on CD in EMI&#x27;s &quot;Great Recordings of the Century&quot; series. Among later complete or substantially complete sets are those conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Elizabeth Harwood as Hanna (1972); Franz Welser-Möst with Felicity Lott (1993); and John Eliot Gardiner with Cheryl Studer (1994).

The Ackermann recording received the highest available rating in the 1956 &quot;The Record Guide&quot; and the later EMI set under Matačić is highly rated by the 2008 &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot;, but Alan Blyth in his &quot;Opera on CD&quot; regrets the casting of a baritone as Danilo in both sets and prefers the 1958 Decca version. Among the filmed productions on DVD, the Penguin Guide recommends the one from the San Francisco Opera, recorded live in 2001, conducted by Erich Kunzel and directed by Lotfi Mansouri, with Yvonne Kenny as Hanna and Bo Skovhus as Danilo.

==Adaptations==

===Ballet ===
With the permission of the Franz Lehár Estate, Sir Robert Helpmann adapted the operetta&#x27;s plot scenario, while John Lanchbery and Alan Abbot adapted the operetta&#x27;s music and composed additional music, for a three-act ballet. &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; ballet, choreographed by Ronald Hynd with designs by Desmond Heeley, was first performed on 13 November 1975 at the Palais Theatre, Melbourne, by The Australian Ballet. The ballet has been performed by American Ballet Theatre, among other major companies.

===Novelization===
In 1909, a novelization of the 1907 American adaptation of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; was published anonymously.

===Films===
Various films have been made that are based loosely on the plot of the operetta:
* Hungarian 1918 silent version by Michael Curtiz
* 1925, US, silent version by Erich von Stroheim, with John Gilbert as Danilo and Mae Murray as Hanna

<text>Barnes was a local government district in north west Surrey from 1894 to 1965, when its former area was absorbed into the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

==History==
The parish of Barnes adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in 1893. It became an urban district in 1894. 

On 1 April 1901 the Putney detached exclave was gained from the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Barnes became a municipal borough in 1932.

It contained the settlements of Barnes, Mortlake and East Sheen. It was part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. The district was bounded by the County of London to the east, the River Thames and Middlesex to the north, and the Municipal Borough of Richmond to the west and south. The council met at 123 Mortlake High Street from 1895 until 1940, when the building was damaged by wartime bombing. After the war the council met at the Penryn Rooms in East Sheen.

In 1965 it was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

== Coat of arms ==

The district&#x27;s coat of arms, granted in 1932, was: Azure a saltire or between four ostrich feathers argent two oars in saltire proper that to the dexter bladed dark blue and that to the sinister bladed light blue. The supporters were: Two griffins gules langued and armed azure, the dexter gorged with a collar flory or, charged with four crosses patée fitchy sable, the sinister gorged with a like collar charged with four lozenges, also sable. There was no crest.

The oars belonged to the boat race teams of the University of Oxford (dark blue) and the University of Cambridge (light blue), whose course on the River Thames ran along the borough&#x27;s northern border, finishing at Mortlake. The feathers were derived from the Prince of Wales at the time of the grant (later Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor) whose birthplace, White Lodge, lay in the former borough. The griffins were derived from the arms of the Earls Spencer, who were once lords of the manor of Mortlake. The crosses came from the arms of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who also once held the same manor, and the lozenges from the arms of the Bishop of Southwark, in whose diocese the borough was situated.

The oars became part of the coat of arms of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, along with the red griffin supporters.

<text>ARA &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; (V-2) was an light aircraft carrier in the Argentine Navy from 1969 to 1997. The English translation of the name is &quot;Twenty-fifth of May&quot;, which is the date of Argentina&#x27;s May Revolution in 1810.

The ship previously served in the Royal Navy as and the Royal Netherlands Navy as . She was deployed south during the Beagle Crisis in 1978 and in the first weeks of the Falklands War (), where her aircraft were deployed against the Royal Navy task force, but spent the bulk of the war in port.

==History==
The ship was built for the Royal Navy by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, England during the Second World War. As a aircraft carrier, she was named and saw service in the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Venerable&quot; only served three years in the Royal Navy before being sold to the Netherlands as .

After a boiler room fire, the carrier was rebuilt, sold to Argentina, and renamed &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;. The Argentine Navy already operated a carrier, This ship was also a former Royal Navy &quot;Colossus&quot; class; however, &quot;Independencia&quot;&#x27;s catapult was not powerful enough to launch jet aircraft, while &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; had had a much more powerful catapult fitted during the Dutch rebuild. &quot;Independencia&quot; was decommissioned in 1970, leaving &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; as the sole remaining carrier in the Argentine fleet. She could carry up to 24 aircraft.

The air group started with F9F Panthers and F9F Cougar jets and later these were replaced with A-4Q Skyhawks supported by S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare aircraft and Sikorsky Sea King helicopters.

In September 1969, during the voyage of the recently bought &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; from the Netherlands, Hawker Siddeley demonstrated their Harrier GR.1 on board the carrier for a possible sale to the Argentine Navy.

During the 1970s the ship was refitted and updated several times, though in each case the duration of each repair period was never more than 3–5 months, allowing her to be available to deploy. Her last pre-Falklands refit occurred during 1981, when she received an update to her radar, arresting gear, steam catapult and (most noticeably) the forward edge of the port side angled deck was filled out via an enlarged sponson. These improvements would theoretically enable her to operate the Super Etendard strike aircraft purchased from France, but it was discovered during testing that the catapult had difficulties launching the aircraft type. As a result, her strike airwing was limited to the A-4Q Skyhawks.

===Beagle Conflict===
During Operation Soberanía, &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was planned to support the invasion of the Picton, Nueva and Lennox islands.

===Falklands War===

During the Falklands War, &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was used in support of the initial Argentine landings on the Falklands. On the day of the invasion, she waited with 1500 army soldiers outside Stanley harbour as the first submarine and boat-landed commandos secured landing areas and then Argentine marines made the main amphibious landing. Her aircraft were not used during the invasion.
Later, in defence of the occupation, she was deployed in a task force north of the Falkland Islands, with the cruiser to the south. The British had assigned , a nuclear-powered submarine, to track down &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; and sink her if necessary. Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, commanding the British task force from stated in his book &quot;One Hundred Days&quot; that, had &quot;Splendid&quot; located the carrier, he would have &quot;Recommended in the strongest possible terms to the Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse that we take them both out this night&quot;.

Following the outbreak of hostilities on 1 May 1982, the Argentine carrier planned an attack on the Royal Navy Task Force. &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;″s S-2 Trackers detected the British fleet late that day, and a strike by all eight A-4Q Skyhawk jets was prepared, scheduled to take-off at dawn. The attack did not take place, because subsequent Tracker sorties had failed to relocate the British fleet. After the British nuclear-powered submarine sank &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; returned to port. The naval A-4Q Skyhawks flew the rest of the war from the airbase in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego.

===Disposal===
In 1983, &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was modified to carry the Super Étendard, and her British-built CAAIS combat data system was replaced by a Dutch SEWACO system, which was compatible with the Argentine Navy&#x27;s new s. From 1986, problems in her engines largely confined her to port; rendering her unserviceable.

Work began in 1988 to refit the carrier, with it being planned to replace her steam turbines with gas turbines, while providing an auxiliary steam plant to power the ship&#x27;s steam catapults. By 1994, the ship&#x27;s machinery had been removed, but a shortage of funds led to work stopping. In December 1996, the Argentine Navy announced that &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; would be discarded. By this time, she had already been stripped of various major pieces of equipment, which were used as spares for the Brazilian carrier , another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ship which had been heavily modified in the Netherlands. Finally, in 2000, she was towed to Alang, India for scrapping.

Although &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was offered to the Argentine Navy in 2000 as a replacement, she was rejected due to her poor condition and high restoration and maintenance costs. As of the 2020s, the Argentine Naval Aviation has lost the use of carrier-capable fixed-wing aircraft. While five refurbished Super Étendard aircraft were delivered to the Navy from France in 2019, these aircraft were missing key spare parts and therefore remained unserviceable. In 2021, it was reported that the return of these aircraft to an operational configuration was also encountering problems as the ejector seats of the aircraft were the MK6, manufactured by British firm Martin-Baker.

<text>Overdrive is the operation of an automobile cruising at sustained speed with reduced engine speed (rpm), leading to better fuel consumption, lower noise, and lower wear. The term is ambiguous. The most fundamental meaning is that of an overall gear ratio between engine and wheels, such that the car is &quot;over-geared&quot;, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in a lower gear, with the engine turning at higher RPM.

The power produced by an engine increases with the engine&#x27;s RPM to a maximum, then falls away. The point of maximum power is somewhat lower than the absolute maximum engine speed to which it is limited, the &quot;redline&quot;. A car&#x27;s speed is limited by the power required to drive it against air resistance, which increases with speed. At the maximum possible speed, the engine is running at its point of maximum power, or &quot;power peak&quot;, and the car is traveling at the speed where air resistance equals that maximum power. There is therefore one specific gear ratio at which the car can achieve its maximum speed: the one that matches that engine speed with that travel speed. At travel speeds below this maximum, there is a range of gear ratios that can match engine power to air resistance, and the most fuel efficient is the one that results in the lowest engine speed. Therefore, a car needs one gearing to reach maximum speed but another to reach maximum fuel efficiency at a lower speed.

With the early development of cars and the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The gearbox was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a &quot;direct-drive&quot; or &quot;straight-through&quot; 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a gearbox ratio even higher than this, i.e. the gearbox output shaft rotating &quot;faster&quot; than the engine. The propeller shaft linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an &quot;overdrive&quot; transmission.

The device for achieving an overdrive transmission was usually a small separate gearbox, attached to the rear of the main gearbox and controlled by its own shift lever. These were often optional on some models of the same car.

As popular cars became faster relative to legal limits and fuel costs became more important, particularly after the 1973 oil crisis, the use of five-speed gearboxes became more common in mass-market cars. These had a direct (1:1) fourth gear with an overdrive fifth gear, replacing the need for the separate overdrive gearbox.

With the popularity of front wheel drive cars, the separate gearbox and final drive have merged into a single transaxle. There is no longer a propeller shaft and so one meaning of &quot;overdrive&quot; can no longer be applied. However the fundamental meaning, that of an overall ratio higher than the ratio for maximum speed, still applies: higher gears, with greater ratios than 1:1, are described as &quot;overdrive gears&quot;.

==Description==
===Background===
The power needed to propel a car at any given set of conditions and speed is straightforward to calculate, based primarily on the total weight and the vehicle&#x27;s speed. These produce two primary forces slowing the car: rolling resistance and air drag. The former varies roughly with the speed of the vehicle, while the latter varies with the square of the speed. Calculating these from first principles is generally difficult due to a variety of real-world factors, so this is often measured directly in wind tunnels and similar systems.

The power produced by an engine increases with the engine&#x27;s RPM to a maximum, then falls away. This is known as the point of maximum power. Given a curve describing the overall drag on the vehicle, it is simple to find the speed at which the total drag forces are the same as the maximum power of the engine. This defines the maximum speed the vehicle is able to reach. The rotational speed of the wheels for that given forward speed is simple to calculate, being the tire circumference multiplied by the RPM. As the tire RPM at maximum speed is not the same as the engine RPM at that power, a transmission is used with a gear ratio to convert one to the other.

At even slightly lower speeds than maximum, the total drag on the vehicle is considerably less, and the engine needs to deliver this greatly reduced amount of power. In this case the RPM of the engine has changed significantly while the RPM of the wheels has changed very little. Clearly this condition calls for a different gear ratio. If one is not supplied, the engine is forced to run at a higher RPM than optimal. As the engine requires more power to overcome internal friction at higher RPM, this means more fuel is used simply to keep the engine running at this speed. Every cycle of the engine leads to wear, so keeping the engine at higher RPM is also unfavorable for engine life. Additionally, the sound of an engine is strongly related to the RPM, so running at lower RPM is generally quieter.

If one runs the same RPM transmission exercise outlined above for maximum speed, but instead sets the &quot;maximum speed&quot; to that of highway cruising, the output is a higher gear ratio that provides ideal fuel mileage. In an era when cars were not able to travel very fast, the maximum power point might be near enough to the desired speed that additional gears were not needed. But as more powerful cars appeared, especially during the 1960s, this disparity between the maximum power point and desired speed grew considerably. This meant that cars were often operating far from their most efficient point. As the desire for better fuel economy grew, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, the need for a &quot;cruising gear&quot; became more pressing.

===Gearbox vs. final drive===
The obvious solution to this problem would be to add more gears to the transmission. Indeed, in modern vehicles this is common. However, due to historical particularities, this was not always practical.

In the conventional rear-wheel drive layout, the transmission system normally contained two sections, the &quot;gearbox&quot; or &quot;transmission&quot; mounted behind the engine, and the &quot;final drive&quot; mounted in the rear axle at the rear of the car. The reason for this separation of duties between the front and back of the car was to allow the drive shaft to run at lower torque, by using higher RPM. As power is the product of RPM and torque, running the shaft at higher RPM allowed more power to be transferred at lower torque. Doing so reduced the torque the driveshaft had to carry, and thus the strength and weight required.

Although the designer was theoretically free to choose any ratio for the gearbox and final drive, there is one additional consideration which meant that the top gear of most gearboxes was 1:1 or &quot;direct drive&quot;. This is chosen for efficiency, as it does not require any gears to transmit power and so reduces the power lost by them. This was particularly important in the early days of cars, as their straight-cut gears were poorly finished, noisy and inefficient. The final drive then took this output and adjusted it in a fixed-ratio transmission arrangement that was much simpler to build. Final drive ratios of 4:1 were common, meaning that the wheels would turn at one fourth the rate they would if directly connected to the engine.

===Overdrive===
In an era when different models of car with different wheel sizes could be accommodated by simply changing the final drive ratio, it made sense for all transmissions to use direct drive as the highest gear. As noted earlier, however, this would cause the engine to operate at too high an RPM for efficient cruising. Although adding the cruising gear to the main gearbox was possible, it was generally simpler to add a separate two-gear overdrive system to the existing gearbox. This not only meant that it could be tuned for different vehicles, but had the additional advantage that it could be offered as an easily installed option.

With the use of front-wheel drive layouts, the gearbox and final drive are combined into a single transaxle. There is no longer a drive shaft between them and so the notion of &quot;direct drive&quot; is inapplicable. Although &quot;overdrive&quot; is still referred to, this is now mostly a marketing term to refer to any extra-high ratio for efficient cruising, whether it is achieved through the gearbox ratios, or by an unusually high final drive.

== Usage ==
Generally speaking, overdrive is the highest gear in the transmission. Overdrive allows the engine to operate at a lower RPM for a given road speed. This allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel efficiency, and often quieter operation on the highway. When it is switched on, an automatic transmission can shift into overdrive mode after a certain speed is reached (usually 70+ km/h [40-45 mph or more] depending on the load). When it is off, the automatic transmission shifting is limited to the lower gears. Overdrive should usually be selected when the average speed is above 70 km/h (40-45 mph).
The automatic transmission automatically shifts from OD to direct drive when more load is present. When less load is present, it shifts back to OD. Under certain conditions, for example driving uphill, or towing a trailer, the transmission may &quot;hunt&quot; between OD and the next highest gear, shifting back and forth. In this case, switching it off can help the transmission to &quot;decide&quot;. It may also be advantageous to switch it off if engine braking is desired, for example when driving downhill. The vehicle&#x27;s owner&#x27;s manual will often contain information and suitable procedures regarding such situations, for each given vehicle.

Virtually all vehicles (cars and trucks) have overdrive today whether manual transmission or automatic. In the automotive aftermarket you can also retrofit overdrive to existing early transmissions. Overdrive was widely used in European automobiles with manual transmission in the 60s and 70s to improve mileage and sport driving as a bolt-on option but it became increasingly more common for later transmissions to have this gear built in. If a vehicle is equipped with a bolt-on overdrive (e.g.: GKN or Gear Vendors) as opposed to having an overdrive built in one will typically have the option to use the overdrive in more gears than just the top gear. In this case gear changing is still possible in all gears, even with overdrive disconnected. Overdrive simply adds effective ranges to the gears, thus overdrive third and fourth become in effect &quot;third-and-a-half&quot; and a fifth gear. In practice this gives the driver more ratios which are closer together providing greater flexibility particularly in performance cars.

== How an overdrive unit works ==

An overdrive consists of an electrically or hydraulically operated epicyclic gear train bolted behind the transmission unit. It can either couple the input driveshaft directly to the output shaft (or propeller shaft) (1:1), or increase the output speed so that it turns faster than the input shaft (1:1 + &quot;n&quot;). Thus the output shaft may be &quot;overdriven&quot; relative to the input shaft. In newer transmissions, the overdrive speed(s) are typically as a result of combinations of planetary/epicyclic gearsets which are integrated in the transmission. For example, the ZF 8HP transmission has 8 forward gears, two of which are overdrive (&lt; 1:1) gear ratios. In older vehicles, it is sometimes actuated by a knob or button, often incorporated into the gearshift knob, and does not require operation of the clutch. Newer vehicles have electronic overdrive in which the computer automatically adjusts to the conditions of power need and load.

== In Europe ==

The vast majority of overdrives in European cars were invented and developed by Edgar de Normanville, and manufactured by the English company Laycock Engineering (later GKN Laycock), at its Little London Road site in Sheffield. The system devised by de Normanville was adopted and manufactured by Laycock after his chance meeting with a Laycock Products Engineer. De Normanville overdrives were found in vehicles manufactured by Standard-Triumph, who were first, followed by Ford, BMC and British Leyland, Jaguar, Rootes Group and Volvo to name only a few. Another British company, the former aircraft builder Fairey, built a successful all-mechanical unit for the Land Rover, which is still in production in America today.

The first production vehicle to feature the Laycock system was the 1948 Standard Vanguard Saloon. The first unit to be created was the A-type overdrive, which was fitted to many sports cars during the 1950s, and into the late 1960s. Several famous marques used A-type overdrives, including Jaguar, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Austin-Healey, Jensen, Bristol, AC, Armstrong Siddeley and Triumph&#x27;s TR sports car range, from the TR2 through to the end of the 1972 model year of the TR6.

In 1959, the Laycock Engineering Company introduced the D-type overdrive, which was fitted to a variety of motor cars including Volvo 120 and 1800s, Sunbeam Alpines and Rapiers, Triumph Spitfires, and also 1962–1967 MGBs (those with 3-synchro transmissions).

From 1967 the LH-type overdrive was introduced, and this featured in a variety of models, including 1968–1980 MGBs, the MGC, the Ford Zephyr, early Reliant Scimitars, TVRs, and Gilberns.

The J-type overdrive was introduced in the late 1960s, and was adapted to fit Volvo, Triumph, Vauxhall/Opel, American Motors and Chrysler motorcars, and Ford Transit vans.

The P-type overdrive marked the last updates and was manufactured in a Gear Vendors U.S. version and a Volvo version. The Volvo version kept the same package size as the J-type but with the updated 18 element freewheel and stronger splines through the planet carrier. The Gear Vendors U.S. version uses a larger 1.375 outer diameter output shaft for higher capacity and a longer rear case.

Over a period of 40 years, Laycock Engineering manufactured over three and a half million overdrive Units, and over one million of these were fitted to Volvo motorcars.

In 2008 the U.S. company Gear Vendors, Inc. of El Cajon, California purchased all the overdrive assets of GKN to continue production of the U.S. version and all spares for J and P types worldwide.

The system features an oil pressure operated device attached to the back of the standard gearbox operating on the gearbox output shaft. Through a system of oil pressure, solenoids and pistons, the overdrive would drop the revs on whatever gears it was used on by 22% (.778). For instance, the overdrive system applied to a Triumph TR5 operates on 2nd, 3rd and top gear. When engaged, the overdrive would drop the revs from 3000 by 666 RPM, or from 3500 the drop would be 777 RPM to 2723 net. The advantages this reduced rpm had on fuel consumption was most often quite near 22% decrease during highway driving.

== In North America ==
In the days before automatic transmissions were common, especially in the 1950s, many rear-wheel drive American cars were available with an overdrive option. With substantial improvements developed in Muncie, Indiana, by William B. Barnes for production by its Warner Gear Division, BorgWarner provided the box that was factory-installed between the transmission and a foreshortened driveshaft. Since the overdrive function, if enabled, could be shifted by simply easing up on the accelerator without depressing the clutch pedal, the action was much like a semi-automatic. Also, an electrically operated solenoid would deactivate the unit via a switch under the accelerator pedal providing the equivalent of the kickdown of the automatic. A knob connected to a bowden cable, similar to some emergency brake applications, was also provided to lock out the unit mechanically. Using overdrive with the main 3-speed transmission in 2nd gear was similar in ratio to 3rd gear, and with the main transmission in third, the overall ratio was fractional (i.e., &quot;true overdrive&quot;). This was important in reducing wear, tear, noise, and difficulty in control.

Such add-on overdrive boxes were available from the 1930s to the 1970s for cars and light trucks.

Today, most petrol and diesel cars and trucks come with an overdrive transmission because of the benefit to fuel economy. Overdrive is included in both automatic and manual transmissions as an extra gear (or two in some cases).

== Fuel economy and drivetrain wear ==
When using overdrive gearing, the car&#x27;s engine speed drops, reducing wear and normally saving fuel. Since 1981 U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) legislation, virtually all domestic vehicles have included overdrive to save fuel. One should refer to the car&#x27;s owner&#x27;s manual for the proper speed to run at overdrive. All engines have a range of peak efficiency and it is possible for the use of overdrive to keep the engine out of this range for all or part of the time of its use if used at inappropriate speeds, thus cutting into any fuel savings from the lower engine speed.

Overall drivetrain reduction comes down to three basic factors: transmission gearing (including overdrive), differential gearing (in the axle), and tire size. The rotation speed problem comes into effect when the differential gearing is a high ratio and an overdrive is used to compensate. This may create unpleasant vibrations at high speeds and possible destruction of the driveshaft due to the centripetal forces or uneven balance.

The driveshaft is usually a hollow metal tube that requires balancing to reduce vibration and contains no internal bracing.

The higher speeds on the driveshaft and related parts can cause heat and wear problems if an overdrive and high differential gearing (or even very small tires) are combined, and create unnecessary friction. This is especially important because the differential gears are bathed in heavy oil and seldom provided with any cooling besides air blowing over the housing.

The impetus is to minimize overdrive use and provide a higher ratio first gear, which means more gears between the first and the last to keep the engine at its most efficient speed. This is part of the reason that modern automobiles tend to have larger numbers of gears in their transmissions. It is also why more than one overdrive gear is seldom seen in a vehicle except in special circumstances i.e. where high (numerical) differential gear is required to get the vehicle moving as in trucks or performance cars though double overdrive transmissions are common in other vehicles, often with a small number on the axle gear reduction, but usually only engage at speeds exceeding .

<text>Zendstation Smilde, also known as the CJ2 Data tower (Dutch: &quot;CJ2 Datatoren&quot;) is a partially guyed tower in Hoogersmilde, Netherlands. Built in 1959 for directional radio services and TV and FM-transmissions, it consists of an high reinforced concrete tower topped since 2012 by a television mast. It originally had a tubular analog TV - UHF antenna for a mast, removed in September 2007 and replaced by a similar UHF antenna for DVB-T, raising the tower&#x27;s height to . Destroyed by a fire on 15 July 2011, that mast was removed, and replaced in 2012 with the current steel lattice one.

The tower is similar in configuration to the Gerbrandy Tower (IJsselstein).

== Owner ==
Originally the mast was built by the state company for Post and Telephony (Koninklijke KPN N.V.) but due to privatisation this has changed. Several masts in The Netherlands, including above mentioned Gerbrandy Tower, have a complex ownership structure:

* The 82 metre (270&#x27;) high concrete tower is owned by Alticom BV
* The steel mast on top of the concrete tower is owned by NOVEC BV, a 100% daughter of TenneT BV, which is itself 100% state-owned
* The grounds on which the mast is located is owned by KPN, except for a ring of 3 metres (10&#x27;) around the base of the tower which is owned by Alticom.

== Aircraft incident ==
On 14 August 1968 a US Air Force plane, an F-100 Super Sabre, from the Lakenheath Air Force Base in England was involved in an accident in heavy low clouds where the tip of a wing hit and broke one of the guy-wires of the tower, causing the upper section of the tower to bend. The pilot made an emergency landing at Soesterberg Royal Netherlands Air Force Base with considerable damage to the right wing.

== Fire and collapse ==
On 15 July 2011, the antenna section caught fire and collapsed, leaving only the concrete base standing.

In the above-mentioned report a warning was given that there was an increased risk of accidents in the masts, mainly because of the complex ownership structure, which left safety processes unclear. An investigation by the Dutch police failed to show any criminal negligence or other contributing factors that could have caused the fire.

=== Rebuilding the mast ===
The fire destroyed the steel mast on top of the concrete tower completely and the top of the concrete tower was damaged. The owner of the steel mast, NOVEC BV, announced that starting in March 2012 erection of the new mast on top of the concrete tower would begin, which would be operational by the summer of 2012. The new steel lattice mast is a few metres (yards) higher than the previous tubular one, bringing the mast to the same height as before 2006. This will prevent the &#x27;chimney effect&#x27; in a fire, increasing safety. On 14 May 2012, at 10:35 the highest point was reached by the builders of VolkerWessels The mast was fully operational again in October 2012.

<text>Vale of Leithen Football Club are a football club based in the town of Innerleithen, thirty miles south of Edinburgh in Scotland. 

They play in the , and their home games take place at Victoria Park.

The team&#x27;s motto is &quot;Keep Faith&quot;, and features on their club crest, along with the town&#x27;s patron saint, St. Ronan. 

The home strip features a blue shirt, navy blue shorts and socks with white trim; the away strip is a yellow shirt, with blue trim.

Vale of Leithen should not be confused with the slightly differently named West of Scotland team Vale of Leven.

== History ==

The club are one of the oldest in the Scottish Borders, having been formed in May 1891, they became full members of the Scottish Football Association in 1897. 

The team began playing at Caddon Park under the name of Leithen Vale but after two games subsequently changed to &quot;Vale of Leithen Football Club&quot;. 

In 1922, they moved to their current home, Victoria Park, which has a ground capacity of around 1,500 standing spectators with one covered stand.

The highest recorded attendance being 3,700 in January 1962 for a Second Round Scottish FA Cup tie against Heart of Midlothian FC.

In August 1974, the ground’s pavilion and changing rooms were completely destroyed by fire causing the loss of the clubs playing equipment and all their historical records over many seasons.

The 1978-79 season saw the club’s most successful campaign with Vale of Leithen winning the East of Scotland Football League and the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup.

The club were founding members of the Lowland Football League in the 2013–14 season. 

Their best finishing position was 6th place in their first campaign, spending nine seasons in the league before being relegated back to the East of Scotland League at the end of the 2021–22 season, and suffering consecutive relegations in the subsequent two seasons.

In March 2023 the club announced the appointment of Ian Flynn as first team manager.

<text>Colonius is the Cologne telecommunications tower, which was finished in 1981. The Colonius possesses a cafeteria, viewing platform, and a restaurant, apart from antennas for radio relay and radio services within the VHF range. Because of a missing leaseholder, the visitor&#x27;s area including restaurant and viewing platform has been closed since 1992. At the time of its completion the Colonius was 252.9 meters high. In 2004 a radio tower added by helicopter increased the height to 266 meters. This addition allowed the broadcast of digital television (DVB-T) from the tower in the Cologne/Bonn region.

<text>Bmibaby Limited (styled as bmibaby.com) was a British low-cost airline that flew to destinations in the United Kingdom and Europe from its bases at Birmingham and East Midlands airports. It was a subsidiary of British Midland International, itself wholly owned by International Airlines Group (IAG). Bmibaby&#x27;s head office was at Donington Hall in Castle Donington, North West Leicestershire, England. Bmibaby held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, and was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

Following the takeover of BMI and its subsidiaries by IAG in April 2012, it was announced on 3 May 2012 that Bmibaby would be shut down in September 2012, with many flights ceasing to operate with effect from 11 June. Bmibaby&#x27;s final flight, from Málaga to East Midlands, operated on 9 September 2012.

==History==
The airline was established on 24 January 2002 and began operations on 22 March 2003 with a flight between East Midlands and Málaga.

Continued expansion for the airline led to it opening further bases at Cardiff in October 2002, Manchester in May 2003, Durham Tees Valley in October 2003, Birmingham in January 2005. and Belfast City Airport in March 2012. Insufficient passenger numbers led to the closure of the Durham Tees Valley base in 2006, followed by both Cardiff and Manchester in 2011 to make way for expansion in the Midlands and the new base at Belfast City.

On 1 March 2007, the airline announced an initiative for business travellers with an &quot;only choose what you need&quot; approach, allowing passengers to choose from a range of services such as ticket flexibility, executive lounge access and on-line check in, and only pay for the services they used. The company also announced that BMI&#x27;s frequent flyers could now gain Diamond Club miles.

By 2007, Bmibaby had nine Boeing 737 aircraft based at East Midlands Airport, making it their biggest base, however in December 2008 the airline announced that it would be suspending five routes from the airport as a result of a reduction in the number of customers booking city-breaks.

Further cuts were announced in November 2009 when it was announced that the fleet would be reduced from 17 to 12 aircraft in 2010, with up to 158 jobs at risk of redundancy. The airline said the action was necessary to stem record losses and that it would focus on growth routes best fit for the business.

In April 2011, Bmibaby announced it would close its bases at Cardiff and Manchester Airports in October 2011 to increase services at Birmingham and East Midlands Airports as well as opening a new base at Belfast City Airport, moving from Belfast International Airport where the airline was based for several years.

In May 2011, Bmibaby launched what it called the first European airline loyalty programme tied into a location-based social network. Passengers use the Gowalla smartphone application at Bmibaby check-in desks to collect points.

On 22 December 2011, IAG announced it had agreed a contract with Lufthansa to buy BMI. The contract allowed for Lufthansa to sell BMI Regional and Bmibaby separately before the completion of the main sale, although the price payable by IAG would be reduced if the airlines were not sold. On 2 February 2012, BMI announced it had signed a &quot;non-binding and non-exclusive&quot; agreement with a &quot;UK-based company&quot;, with plans to complete the sale by the summer of 2012. The sale was not completed by the time IAG purchased BMI, and so Bmibaby and BMI Regional became part of the group. IAG said it would continue the attempts to sell both airlines.

However, on 3 May 2012 IAG announced that it had not found a buyer for Bmibaby and that it was proposing to shut down the company by 9 September 2012. Flights to some destinations such as Belfast, Amsterdam, Paris and Geneva ended on 11 June 2012. All remaining services ended by 9 September 2012. The final flight to operate was flight WW5330 from Malaga to East Midlands. Over 800 jobs were lost by the closure, including 400 at the head office in Castle Donington.

After its closure, WOW air took the WW IATA code while the ICAO code BMI remains unused.

== Destinations ==
Bmibaby served the following destinations before its closure on 9 September 2012:

== Fleet ==
As of September 2012, the Bmibaby fleet consisted of the following aircraft in an all-economy class configuration:

Several aircraft had names with the word &quot;baby&quot; in the title. After all flights ceased, the aircraft were placed in storage at Norwich International Airport and Lasham Airfield. The majority of the airline&#x27;s fleet was leased. As of November 2014, all the fleet had moved on from Bmibaby, one had been scrapped (G-OBMP) and the last one partly remains with some of the fuselage in some trees at Bruntingthorpe (G-BVKB).

== Services ==
=== Onboard ===
Bmibaby offered a buy on board programme with variety of items to purchase including scratch-cards, tax-free shopping and onboard drinks and snacks. The shopping range included items such as jewellery and fragrances, gifts and travel accessories. On non-EU flights, duty-free priced cigarettes and spirits could be purchased. Drinks and snack items included hot and cold drinks, alcoholic and soft drinks as well as crisps, sandwiches and confectionery. The drinks and snack menu was named the &quot;Tiny Bites&quot; menu. The Bmibaby inflight magazine was known as &quot;Yeah baby!&quot;

The majority of Bmibaby&#x27;s cabins had shaded blue leather seating with a 29/30&quot; seat pitch. Extra legroom seats could be found on the front rows and on over-wing exit rows of all the Bmibaby 737 aircraft.

=== Telephone booking ===
In addition to online booking on the bmibaby.com website; Bmibaby employed 20-30 customer service representatives to take telephone queries and bookings. Prior to November 2005 the team were located in Glasgow. From November 2005, the team was based in Belfast working in the TeleTech customer contact centre. The call centre was then moved to Delhi, India and remained there until the firm&#x27;s closure in 2012.

== Sponsorship ==
Bmibaby began to sponsor regional weather forecasts on ITV from shortly after the airline&#x27;s launch, starting in the Central region in 2002 and ending in the Granada region in early 2005. The sponsorship lasted for several years until new sponsorships took over between 2009 &amp; 2011.

<text>The Sint-Pieters-Leeuw Tower, sometimes called the VRT-toren, although there are several by that name, is a free standing tower at Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, on the outskirts of Brussels, Belgium, built between 1991 and 1994. It is the tallest free standing structure in Belgium. The tower&#x27;s location, south-west of Brussels, was chosen for its central location in Belgium and to minimize hindrance to Brussels Airport beyond the opposite end of the city. The tower is owned by Norkring België.

After its construction, it emerged that the tower was built illegally, due to irregularities in the building permits. There were complaints against it as locals feel the unpainted concrete is an eyesore, and it has even been suggested that the tower may be demolished. In April 2007, the irregularities were straightened out and the tower has retroactively acquired the legal permit to be built.

<text>Greenock Juniors Football Club are a Scottish football club based in Greenock, Inverclyde. They compete in and play home matches at Ravenscraig Stadium, on Auchmead Road - a five-minute walk from Branchton railway station. The club were decanted for a short period of time as the Stadium received multi-million pound upgrades in preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

==History==
In season 1959–60 Greenock made their only appearance in the final of the Scottish Junior Cup. They were beaten 3–1 by St Andrews United at Hampden Park, Glasgow in front of a crowd of 34,603. Their quarter-final tie against Johnstone Burgh earlier in the competition attracted a record attendance of 8,000 to Ravenscraig Stadium.

In June 2017, former player Thomas Molloy was appointed as manager, assisted by former Kilmarnock FC and Greenock Morton Central Defender Shaun Dillon, Owen Archdeacon and goalkeeping coach Gavin Pick. Thomas and his management team left the club in the summer of 2021 to join West of Scotland Premier League team, Kilbirnie Ladeside.

In September 2021, former Kirkintiloch Rob Roy coach, John Doyle was appointed as Manager. His tenure was short, leaving 4 months later for the First Team Managers role at Division One side, St Cadocs.

In January 2022, following a period of instability, former Goalkeeper, Ian Nixon, was appointed as Club Manager. Assisted by staff, Derrick McMillan, Ross Holland and Kenny McLachlan, formerly of Beith Juniors FC, he secured qualification to the Second Division with an 8th-placed finish in Conference B, of the West of Scotland Football Leagues 2021/22 season.

The actor Martin Compston played briefly for the club following his release from Greenock Morton.

<doc id="560634" wikidata="Q287978" url="?curid=560634" title="County-class cruiser">
<text>The County class was a class of heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the years between the First and Second World Wars. They were the first &#x27;post-war&#x27; cruisers constructed for the Royal Navy and were designed within the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch calibre main guns may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers&quot; (the term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty of 1930).

The thirteen Counties were built in the &quot;Kent&quot;, &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; sub-classes. They were the only 10,000-ton 8-inch gun, or &quot;A&quot;, cruisers that the Royal Navy built. The Counties are remembered for their distinctive three-funnel layout and service in all the major naval theatres of the Second World War.

To extract more ships from the treaty limits, the navy planned to construct 8,250-ton &quot;B&quot; ships, six of which could be built in place of five Counties. The extra ship that this afforded was an attractive proposition for a navy that had the immense peacetime commitments of empire. Peacetime economies and politics intervened and only two B-type cruisers were built, an 8-inch gun modified County design: the .

In 1929, the mean cost of each &quot;A&quot; ship was estimated to be £2,180,000, whilst the mean cost of each &quot;B&quot; ship was estimated to be £1,800,000.

==Design and development==
The design of the class was led by Charles Lillicrap, a member of the naval construction department of the Admiralty.

The 10,000-ton treaty cruisers were the first type of warships built to internationally agreed restrictions. These restrictions posed new engineering challenges and forced compromises upon designers in how to extract the best balance of speed, armament and protection. The United States Navy adopted a design with triple-gun turrets, allowing the hull to be shortened thus saving weight that could be put into protection. This approach required increased power, as the speed of a ship is a function of the ratio of length to beam. The Royal Navy had a requirement for a vessel for colonial trade route defence, which required a good cruising range and speed and independent fighting power. This determined the need for a long hull and the use of four twin-gun turrets, with any remaining displacement invested in protection.

The design was conservative in nature, especially when compared to the contemporary &quot;Nelson&quot;-class battleships built to satisfy the same treaty. The long (630 feet overall) hull was flush decked and with a high freeboard and was strongly built. This afforded high initial stability, which contributed to the protection scheme. The machinery spaces followed the traditional layout of boiler rooms ahead of engine rooms, separated by an amidships magazine. The two boiler rooms exhausted into four uptakes, the central pair being combined to form a thickened central funnel. The three-funnel design was handsome but a somewhat impractical use of internal space.

As had been tested in the First World War Emerald class cruiser , whose completion had been delayed post-war, the Counties featured a new design of forward superstructure incorporating the navigating bridge, wheelhouse, signalling and compass platforms and gunnery director in a block. This advance considerably rationalised the separate armoured conning tower and myriad of decks and platforms of older designs. Moving the fire-control equipment from the mast negated the need for a heavy tripod and light pole masts sufficed for signalling yards and the spread of wireless antennae.

===Armament===
The guns, BL 8-inch (203 mm) Mark VIII, were equally disposed in superfiring twin turrets fore and aft. The turret design was needlessly complicated by the original requirement that they should be capable of anti-aircraft fire and were thus provided with a maximum elevation of 70°, despite the inability to train and elevate sufficiently quickly to track aerial targets and the complete lack of a suitable fire control system.

Secondary armament consisted of four QF Mark V guns in single mounts HA Mk.III fed from the amidships magazine. There were quadruple-tube torpedo launchers, one each side, amidships. The single 4-inch Mk V guns were later replaced by Mk XVI guns in paired mountings. In a fruitless attempt to keep within treaty limits, the Mark XVI mounting was stripped down to reduce the weight, the result being the Mark XVII, an exercise described as &quot;ridiculous punctiliousness&quot;. They were later converted back to standard Mark XVI mounts. The initial design called for two octuple mountings for the 40 mm QF 2-pounder Mk.VIII anti-aircraft autocannon but as a weight-saving exercise these were not initially shipped and the existing QF 2-pounder Mark II was carried in lieu on four single mounts. Space was provided for a rotating catapult and a crane for operating aircraft, although again these were initially not provided.

===Protection===
The initial design left little weight to distribute amongst protection. Thus, the traditional side-belt of armour was dispensed with and the side plating was sufficient to only give protection against shell splinters. A protective deck covered the machinery spaces and there were &quot;box citadels&quot; protecting the magazines and shell rooms; crowns and sides, closed by 2.5-inch bulkheads. The aft box citadel had slightly reduced thicknesses at the ends and the citadel amidships had thinner armour as it lay within the confines of the armoured deck and side plating. There was a arch over the steering gear closed by a 1-inch-thick forward bulkhead. The turrets and barbettes received only thin splinter plating, as did the compass platform. There were external bulges to provide torpedo protection.

==Differences and modifications==

===&quot;Kent&quot; class===
Originally planned as a programme of 17 Royal Navy vessels, the numbers were cut back significantly following the formation of the first Labour Government after the election of December 1923. Of the eight ships planned to begin construction in 1924, only five were approved, with a further two ordered later by the Royal Australian Navy.

These initial seven ships – , , , , and , built for the Royal Navy, and and for the Royal Australian Navy – formed the &quot;Kent&quot; class. All were ordered in 1924 and commissioned in 1928. It was quickly found necessary to heighten the funnels by some to clear the flue gasses from the aft superstructure. The Australian ships, &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; had them raised a further . Between 1930 and 1933 the aircraft and catapult were added, as was a high-angle HACS director for the 4-inch guns. &quot;Kent&quot; received an additional pair of 4-inch guns in 1934, and she, &quot;Berwick&quot; and &quot;Cornwall&quot; each received a pair of QF 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns added abreast the fore funnel.

By the mid-1930s, the British &quot;Kent&quot;s were due for modernisation. However, there was little surplus weight for the designers to work with while remaining within the Treaty requirements; they were between 150 and 250 tons under the treaty limits and it was estimated that a further 200-odd tons could be gained through various savings. A armoured belt, thick, was added amidships, extending down from the armoured deck to 1 foot below the waterline. &quot;Cumberland&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; had the aft superstructure razed and replaced by a large hangar for two aircraft and a fixed athwartships catapult. A crane was fitted on either side of the after funnel, and the rear gunnery, navigation and control positions were relocated to the hangar roof. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and quadruple mountings, Mark VII, were added on either side of the bridge. The 4-inch guns were relocated, and the rearmost pair were replaced by twin mountings Mark XIX for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI. To keep weight within acceptable margins, the hull was cut down by one deck aft of &quot;Y&quot; turret. &quot;Berwick&quot; and &quot;Cornwall&quot; were similarly converted, but with more weight in hand the hull was not cut down; all four 4-inch mounts were twins and the 2-pounder guns were octuple mounts. By 1939, the torpedo tubes had been removed in all four ships.

&quot;Kent&quot; had less weight available for improvements and therefore was not given such an extensive modernisation. While she received the 4-inch armour belt and the double 4-inch gun mounts like her sisters, she retained the rotating catapult and after superstructure, with an additional fire-control position mounted on a distinctive lattice structure aft. Her anti-aircraft armaments were improved as for her sisters, but the multiple 2-pounders and their directors were carried aft, by the lattice structure. The naval historian H. Trevor Lenton estimates that despite the best attempts, none of these ships stayed within the treaty limits; &quot;Kent&quot;″s full load displacement was 14,197 tons, indicating a standard displacement of around 10,600 tons. Lenton expresses doubts whether the Admiralty ever informed the Government of these excesses, as with war imminent, &quot;there were more pressing demands on their time&quot;. Another historian, Leo Marriott, gives an alternative displacement of 10,300 tons and notes that it was &quot;unofficially accepted&quot; by the UK, USA, Italy, France and Japan that refits could allow ships to exceed the London treaty limits by up to 300 tons.

===&quot;London&quot; class===
The second group, the four ships of the &quot;London&quot; class (, , and ), closely followed the design of the &quot;Kent&quot;s. The external bulges were not present, reducing the beam by , and the hull was lengthened by ; these changes translated into a -knot increase in speed. To remedy the loss of the bulge protection, there was a second skin of inner plating to provide the same effect. The bridge was moved aft to lessen the effects of muzzle blast from B turret when the guns were trained abaft the beam. They had heightened funnels as built. The aircraft and catapult had been fitted by 1932.

In all ships but &quot;Sussex&quot;, four 4-inch guns were added in single mountings abreast the funnels. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and two quadruple mounts for 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns were added. &quot;Shropshire&quot; acquired an additional anti-aircraft fire control director. Early in the war, the additional 4-inch guns were removed, and the original 4-inch guns altered to the Mark XVI twin mounts. The octuple 2-pounder guns that had originally been designed in were also finally added.

From 1938 to 1941, &quot;London&quot; received an altogether more comprehensive modernisation. Her upperworks were removed and replaced by new fore and aft superstructures and two upright funnels modelled on the contemporary cruisers. The forward superstructure block incorporated a large hangar opening onto an athwartships catapult between the superstructure blocks. There was a catapult on either side of the after funnel. The 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by twin mountings and relocated to the after superstructure, with the torpedoes a deck below. The 2-pounder guns were carried on the hangar roof and the multiple Vickers guns mounted, one each, on the roofs of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;X&quot; turrets. A belt, deep, was added abreast the machinery spaces, extending up to the armoured deck. However, the hull had originally been carefully designed to reduce weight based on the initial arrangements. The modifications to &quot;London&quot; added heavy weights fore and aft and severely overstressed the hull. As a result cracks and loose rivets began to appear on the upper deck. The upper deck was reinforced, which caused the stress to be transmitted through the lower hull instead and cracks began to appear under the waterline. It took underwater reinforcements and refits extending into 1943 to remedy the situation.

The outbreak of war prevented what had ended up being a rather fruitless cosmetic rebuild being extended to the rest of her sisters, as had originally been intended. The remaining &quot;London&quot;s thus never received side armouring or the improved aircraft complement.

During wartime refits, the last three &quot;London&quot;s underwent similar alterations as the &quot;Kent&quot;s did, having their eight torpedo tubes removed, and &quot;X&quot; turret removed, although both &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Shropshire&quot; retained it. &quot;Shropshire&quot;, unlike her two un-converted sisters retained her torpedo armament, and was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in early 1943 to replace &quot;Canberra&quot;.

===&quot;Norfolk&quot; class===
The final pair of Counties – and – formed the &quot;Norfolk&quot; class. Another two ships that had been deferred from the 1927–1928 and 1928–1929 programmes – to have been named &quot;Northumberland&quot; and &quot;Surrey&quot; – were ordered on 15 May 1929, but suspended on 23 August and finally cancelled on 14 January 1930. A proposed fifth vessel of the sub-class was also cancelled. This was due to the change in administration in 1929 that ushered in a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald. The new government cancelled the ships as an economy measure and as a gesture to the forthcoming London Naval Conference 1930.

The &quot;Norfolk&quot;s were repeats of the &quot;London&quot;s with minor alterations. The bridge and after superstructure were lowered. The 8-inch gun mountings were Mark II variants that simplified loading but ended up being heavier than the Mark I variant. The 4-inch guns were relocated forwards in order that they did not obstruct the catapult and aircraft which had been mounted lower down than in their predecessors. During 1937, the 4-inch guns were replaced by twins, octuple 2-pounders were added around the after superstructure and the single guns forward were removed. These improvements pushed the standard displacement over 10,400 tons.

During the war, UP rocket launchers were initially added, but they were later removed along with the Vickers guns. These were replaced by the altogether more useful 20 mm Oerlikon gun. An additional director for the 4-inch guns was added, and the pole masts were replaced by tripods to support the additional weight of masthead electronics. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was sunk in 1942, and so it was only &quot;Norfolk&quot; that underwent a refit in 1944, during which her aircraft, catapult and X turret were removed. This allowed four quadruple 2-pounder mounts and their directors and four single 40 mm Bofors guns to be added. An extra superstructure was added aft to carry barrage directors, fitted with radar Type 283, which finally allowed the main armament to serve in its intended anti-aircraft role.

It was intended for &quot;Surrey&quot; and &quot;Northumberland&quot; to have a modified design, more heavily armoured but slower.

===Comparison of classes===

==Ships==


==Service==

The County class saw much service during the Second World War. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; were equipped with radar which was used to good advantage when they shadowed the during the RN&#x27;s attempts to hunt her down after the sinking of .

The class saw service in nearly every theatre of the war. &quot;Norfolk&quot;, &quot;Suffolk&quot;, and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; were involved in the pursuit of &quot;Bismarck&quot; and . &quot;Berwick&quot; fought a gunnery action with the , and &quot;Norfolk&quot; again fought German Navy surface units during Battle of the North Cape. &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Sussex&quot; suffered bomb damage from Luftwaffe aircraft, and both required substantial repairs. Three of the class were lost, with &quot;Canberra&quot; being hit by naval gunfire at the Battle of Savo Island then scuttled by a U.S. destroyer, and &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; both bombed and sunk by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft during the Indian Ocean raid.

The survivors began decommissioning in 1948, and were all decommissioned by the mid-1950s, except &quot;Cumberland&quot;, which was an armaments trials ship testing the automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns that would be fitted to the . She was scrapped in 1959.

==&quot;Canarias&quot; class==

Two ships based on the County class, and of the , were designed in the UK and constructed in Spain by the Vickers-Armstrongs subsidiary Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval. Completed in the late 1930s for the Spanish Navy, they saw service during the Spanish Civil War. Although they shared a common hull, machinery and main armament, the Spanish ships had a notably different appearance, with an enormous single funnel – though &quot;Canarias&quot; received two funnels in a later refit – and an equally tall forward superstructure.

<text>Aeritalia was an aerospace engineering corporation based in Italy. It was formed out of the merger of two aviation companies, Fiat Aviazione and Aerfer, in 1969.

Aeritalia continued several programs of its preceding companies, perhaps most prominently the Fiat G.222 transport aircraft. Furthermore, the company was involved in various multinational programs and initiatives, including the European multirole aircraft Panavia Tornado, the ATR family of regional airliners, and the fighter-bomber AMX International AMX. Aeritalia was also a partner in the Boeing 767 from its inception, and played a key role in the creation of the Italian space industry, being involved in the Alfa rocket. In 1990, Aeritalia and Selenia were merged at the behest of parent corporation Finmeccanica to create Alenia Aeronautica, an aerospace and defense specialist.

==History==
Aeritalia was created during 1969 by the merger of Aerfer and Fiat Aviazione&#x27;s aviation businesses.

In response to a NATO-issued specification for a V/STOL transport aircraft (NATO Basic Military Requirement 4), Fiat&#x27;s design team, led by Giuseppe Gabrielli, produced a design to meet this requirement, designated &quot;G.222&quot;. According to Aeritalia, the G.222 designation is derived from the first letter of the aircraft&#x27;s chief designer; the first &#x27;2&#x27; referring to the twin-engine arrangement, and the final &#x27;22&#x27; referring to the revised NATO Basic Military Requirement 22 to which it had been submitted. The Italian Air Force (AMI), who sought a replacement for the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, felt that the G.222 proposal had merit and placed an order for two prototypes and a ground-test airframe in 1968. It was substantially redeveloped from the NATO submission, the V/STOL lift engines were omitted and a pair of General Electric T64 turboprop engines were adopted; subsequently, the G.222 lacked a V/STOL capability but retained considerable short take-off/landing (STOL) performance.
During December 1971, the Italian Air Force held a formal evaluation of the G.222 which led to a contract for 44 aircraft being issued to Aeritalia. In December 1975, the first production aircraft conducted its first flight. Following on from its introduction by the AMI, the G.222 was procured as a tactical transport aircraft by various international customers, including Argentina, Nigeria, Somalia, Venezuela and Thailand. In December 1978, Aeritalia elected to transfer final assembly of the G.222 from Turin to Naples, at which point a total of 44 firm orders had been obtained for the type and one aircraft per month was being manufactured. Manufacturing of the G.222 was broken down into various companies; construction of the fuselage was performed at Naples, the center-section of the wing was produced by Piaggio, the wing panels were made by Macchi, the tail surfaces were built by SIAI-Marchetti, the engine nacelles by IAM, and the T64 engines were license-manufactured by Alfa Romeo and Fiat.

During early 1977, the Italian Air Force issued a requirement for 187 new-build strike fighters, which were to replace its existing Aeritalia G.91 in the close air support and reconnaissance missions, as well as the Lockheed RF-104G Starfighter also being used in the reconnaissance role. Rather than competing for the contract, Aeritalia and Italian aerospace company Aermacchi agreed to produce a joint proposal for the requirement, as both firms had been considering the development of a similar class of aircraft for some years. In April 1978, work on the joint venture formally commenced. During 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program to replace the Aermacchi MB-326. In July 1981, the Italian and Brazilian governments agreed on joint requirements, and Embraer was invited to join the industrial partnership. An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5 per cent of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8 per cent (front fuselage and tail cone), and Embraer performed 29.7 per cent of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks).

During the 1960s and 1970s, European aircraft manufacturers had undergone considerable corporate restructuring, including mergers and consolidations, as well as moved towards collaborative multi-national programmes, such as the newly launched Airbus A300. In line with this trend towards intra-European cooperation, French aerospace company Aérospatiale and Aeritalia commenced discussions on the topic of working together to develop an all-new regional airliner. Prior to this, both companies had been independently conducting studies for their own aircraft concepts, the &quot;AS 35&quot; design in the case of Aerospatiale and the &quot;AIT 230&quot; for Aeritalia, to conform with demand within this sector of the market as early as 1978.

On 4 November 1981, a formal Cooperation Agreement was signed by Aeritalia chairman Renato Bonifacio and Aerospatiale chairman Jacques Mitterrand in Paris, France. This agreement signaled not only the merger of their efforts, but of their separate concept designs together into a single complete aircraft design for the purpose of pursuing its development and manufacture as a collaborative joint venture. The consortium then targeted a similar unit cost but a fuel consumption over a sector, nearly half the required by its 40-50 seat competitors, the British Aerospace HS.748 and Fokker F.27, and planned a 58-seat ATR XX stretch. This agreement served not only as the basis and origins of the ATR company, but also as the effective launch point of what would become the fledgling firm&#x27;s first aircraft, which was designated as the &quot;ATR 42&quot;. By 1983, ATR&#x27;s customer services division has been set up, readying infrastructure worldwide to provide support for ATR&#x27;s upcoming aircraft to any customer regardless of location.

During 1990, Aeritalia was reorganised by its corporate parent, Finmeccanica; it merged with Selenia to form Alenia Aeronautica, which functioned as Finmeccanica&#x27;s aerospace division.

<text>Alenia Aeronautica was an Italian aerospace company. Its subsidiaries included Alenia Aermacchi and Alenia Aeronavali.

Alenia Aeronautica was also the part-owner of ATR, a joint venture with European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS).

During January 2012, the company was reorganized as Alenia Aermacchi. Three years later, it was fully merged into Finmeccanica, which has since reorganised itself as a more integrated business, adopting the Leonardo name for the group

== History ==

Alenia Aeronautica was created during 1990 by merger of IRI&#x27;s Aeritalia and Selenia subsidiaries.

The new company was associated with several ongoing aircraft programmes and partnerships, including the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon fighter programme, the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber. As a partner in Panavia Aircraft GmbH, Aeritalia manufactured the Tornado&#x27;s wings while the other partners (British Aerospace and MBB/DASA) manufactured the rest of the airframe. It also held a 20 per cent stake in Turbo-Union, a separate company formed to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft. Production of the Tornado ended in 1998; the final batch of aircraft being produced was delivered to the Royal Saudi Air Force.

Alenia had 19.5% a workshare stake in the Eurofighter Typhoon programme. On 27 March 1994, the maiden flight of the Eurofighter prototype took place in Bavaria. In September 1998, contracts were signed for production of 148 Tranche1 aircraft and procurement of long lead-time items for Tranche2 aircraft.

During 1992, Aermacchi signed a cooperation agreement with Russian aircraft company Yakovlev to support a new trainer that the firm was developing for the Russian Air Force. Aermacchi secured the right to modify and market the aircraft for the Western market. The resulting aircraft first flew in 1996 and by this point, the aircraft was being marketed as the Yak/AEM-130.

In October 1998, it was reported that the venture was increasingly becoming an Italian-led effort due to a lack of Russian financial support.

In mid-2000, it was announced that differences between the two firms and a lack of backing from the Russian participants had ended the partnership. Instead, each company would pursue independent development. Yakovlev received a final payment of US$77 million for technical documents. Yakovlev would be able to sell the Yak-130 to countries such as those in the Commonwealth of Independent States, India, Slovakia and Algeria, while Aermacchi had the right to sell the M-346 to NATO nations and others. The M-346 is a highly modified version of the aircraft that developed under the joint venture, using equipment exclusively from Western manufacturers. The first M-346 prototype rolled out on 7 June 2003, and conducted its maiden flight on 15 July 2004.

In January 2005, the Greek Ministry of Defense signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to become a partner in the programme and an industrial cooperation agreement between Alenia and the Hellenic Aerospace Industry was signed the following year.

In March 2008, the Chilean ENAER signed an MOU with Alenia at the FIDAE air show. During May 2008, Boeing signed an MOU to cooperate on the marketing, sales, training and support of two Aermacchi trainers, the M-346 and the M-311. On 18 December 2008, Aermacchi announced that the M-346 had attained a maximum speed of Mach 1.15 (1,255 km/h, 678 knots, 780 mph), claiming the occasion to be the first in which an all-Italian built aircraft had broken the sound barrier in 50 years.

On 20 June 2011, a Military Type Certification was granted to Alenia Aermacchi for the M-346 Master by the General Directorate for Aeronautical Armaments of the Italian Ministry of Defence in Rome.

===C-27J===
In 1995, Alenia and Lockheed Martin began discussions to improve Alenia&#x27;s G.222 utility transport aircraft using C-130J&#x27;s glass cockpit and a more powerful version of the G.222&#x27;s T64G engine and four-blade propellers. This became the C-27J and in 1997, Alenia and Lockheed Martin formed Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems (LMATTS) to develop the C-27J. The design changed to use the C-130J&#x27;s AE 2100 engine and six-blade propeller. Other changes include a fully digital MIL-STD-1553 systems and avionics architecture, and an updated cargo compartment for increased commonality. The C-27J has a 35% increase in range and a 15% faster cruise speed than the G.222. Alenia Aeronautica paired with American defense specialist L-3 Communications to form the Global Military Aircraft Systems (GMAS) joint venture to market the C-27J; Boeing also joined GMAS. During 2007, it was announced that the C-27J had been selected by the US Defense Department for its Joint Cargo Aircraft programme; the C-27J team was awarded an initial contract worth US$2.04 billion for 78 C-27Js in June 2007.

===Transition to Leonardo===
During 2002, Alenia Aeronautica was incorporated when Finmeccanica restructured itself, spinning off its various divisions as independent companies. Finmeccanica has since reorganised itself into a more closely integrated business, adopting the Leonardo name for the group.

<doc id="560664" wikidata="Q1050790" url="?curid=560664" title="Catharanthus">
<text>Catharanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. Like the genus &quot;Vinca&quot;, they are known commonly as periwinkles. There are eight known species. Seven are endemic to Madagascar, though one, &quot;C. roseus&quot;, is widely naturalized around the world. The eighth species, &quot;C. pusillus&quot;, is native to India and Sri Lanka. The name &quot;Catharanthus&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;pure flower&quot;.

These are perennial herbs with oppositely or almost oppositely arranged leaves. Flowers are usually solitary in the leaf axils. Each has a calyx with five long, narrow lobes and a corolla with a tubular throat and five lobes.

&quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;, known formerly as &quot;Vinca rosea&quot;, is a main source of &quot;vinca&quot; alkaloids, now sometimes called catharanthus alkaloids. The plant produces about 130 of these compounds, including vinblastine and vincristine, two drugs used to treat cancer.

&quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Several cultivars have been bred to produce flowers in many shades of pink, red, lilac, and white, or in light shades with dark throats.

;Species
# &quot;Catharanthus coriaceus&quot; – Madagascar
# &quot;Catharanthus lanceus&quot; – Madagascar
# &quot;Catharanthus longifolius&quot; – Madagascar
# &quot;Catharanthus ovalis&quot; – Madagascar
# &quot;Catharanthus pusillus&quot; – India, Sri Lanka, Western Himalayas
# &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; – Madagascar periwinkle, old-maid, rosy periwinkle, pink periwinkle – Madagascar; naturalized in Italy, S Asia, Australia, S United States, Central America, India and various oceanic islands
# &quot;Catharanthus scitulus&quot; – Madagascar
# &quot;Catharanthus trichophyllus&quot; – Madagascar. It is also known as Sadabahar or Baramasi in India.

<text>Lady Helen Marina Lucy Taylor (&quot;née&quot; Windsor; born 28 April 1964) is a member of the British royal family. She is the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and Katharine, Duchess of Kent, and a great-granddaughter of George V. She is currently 48th in the line of succession to the British throne.

==Early life and youth==
Lady Helen was born in April 1964 at Coppins, a country house in Iver, Buckinghamshire, the only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Kent. She was christened on 6 June 1964 at the private chapel at Windsor Castle by the Dean of Windsor Rt. Rev. Robin Woods. Her godparents were Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon; Hon. Angus Ogilvy, Myra Butter, and Sir Philip Hay.

She was educated at Eton End School in Datchet, then at St Mary&#x27;s School, Wantage, and Gordonstoun. At Gordonstoun, she was one of 20 sixth form girls &quot;in the robustly masculine environment of Gordonstoun,&quot; wrote Alan Hamilton.

She was called &quot;Melons&quot; in the popular press.

I was slightly chubby, it was the boys at Gordonstoun who called me that. I think there are only about two people who call me that now. The original context has long gone

During the 1980s, her boyfriend was Nigel Oakes, who &quot;appalled the Queen&quot; after she smuggled him into her parents&#x27; grace-and-favour home, York House, St James&#x27;s Palace.

According to Lol Tolhurst of The Cure, Lady Helen was a &quot;mad Cure fan&quot; who visited the band backstage at a gig in Bath in 1983.

==Career==
After she left Gordonstoun (where she had art class), she was desperate to come to London and earn money, starting in 1984 at Christie&#x27;s auction house in their Contemporary Department.

Lady Helen worked with the art dealer Karsten Schubert between 1987 and 1991, behind the front desk, and was later credited with discovering Rachel Whiteread and Gary Hume, but confessed in a television interview that she had turned down representing artist Damien Hirst.

For 17 years, Lady Helen was a fashion ambassador and muse to Giorgio Armani.

==Marriage and children==
At 19, Lady Helen met Timothy Verner Taylor (born 8 August 1963), an art dealer and the eldest son of Commander Michael Verner Taylor, RN and Susan Geraldine Percy. They married nine years later, on 18 July 1992, at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The bride wore a Catherine Walker design. Giorgio Armani provided an outfit for her wedding.

In 1998, her husband was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.

Lady Helen and her husband have four children, who immediately follow her in the Line of succession to the British throne:
* Columbus George Donald Taylor (born 6 August 1994)
* Cassius Edward Taylor (born 26 December 1996)
* Eloise Olivia Katherine Taylor (born 2 March 2003)
* Estella Olga Elizabeth Taylor (born 21 December 2004)

==Charity work==
She is a patron of the CLIC Sargent children&#x27;s cancer charity.

She is a trustee of The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.

She is on the advisory board of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera after being a trustee.

<text>The Scottish Football League First Division was the second tier in the Scottish football league system between 1975 and 2013. It was replaced by the Scottish Championship.

==History==
The First Division was introduced in 1975–76 to replace the old Scottish Football League Division Two, as the top flight of the Scottish Football League was renamed from Division One to Premier Division.

In 1998, the Premier Division clubs broke away from the Scottish Football League to form the Scottish Premier League. The First Division remained the second tier of the Scottish league system, but was now the top tier of the Scottish Football League. In July 2013, the Scottish Football League and Scottish Premier League merged to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). The SPFL named its second tier as the Scottish Championship, which effectively replaced the First Division.

==Competition==
From 1994 until 2013, the First Division consisted of ten teams. From 1998, only the winner of the First Division was promoted to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), subject to that club meeting the SPL stadium criteria. From 2007, the bottom club in the First Division was automatically relegated to the Second Division and the second bottom club went into an end of season play-off with the second, third and fourth placed clubs in the Second Division.

The ten teams in the First Division played each other four times with three points for a victory and one point each for a drawn game.

<text>Raymond Johnson Chapman (January 15, 1891 – August 17, 1920) was an American baseball player. He spent his entire career as a shortstop for the Cleveland Indians of the American League.

Chapman was hit in the head by a pitch thrown by pitcher Carl Mays and died 12 hours later. He is, , the only player to die directly from an injury received during a major league game. His death led baseball to establish a rule requiring umpires to replace the ball whenever it becomes dirty. Chapman&#x27;s death and sanitary concerns also led to the ban on spitballs after the 1920 season. Chapman&#x27;s death was also one of the examples cited to justify the wearing of batting helmets. However, it took over 30 years to adopt the rule that required their use.

==Early life, family and education==
Chapman was born in Beaver Dam, Kentucky, and raised in Herrin, Illinois.

==Career==
Chapman broke into the major leagues in 1912 with the Cleveland team, then known as the Naps.

Chapman led the American League in runs scored and walks in 1918. A top-notch bunter, Chapman is sixth on the all-time list for sacrifice hits and holds the single season record with 67 in 1917. Only Stuffy McInnis has more career sacrifices as a right-handed batter. Chapman was also an excellent shortstop who led the league in assists once. He batted .300 or better three times, and led the Indians in stolen bases four times. In 1917, he set a team record of 52 stolen bases, which stood until 1980. He was hitting .303 with 97 runs scored when he died. He was one of the few players whom Ty Cobb considered a friend.

There was conjecture that 1920 was going to be Chapman&#x27;s last year as a pro baseball player. Shortly before the season began, Chapman married Kathleen Daly, who was the daughter of a prominent Cleveland businessman. Chapman had indicated he was going to retire to devote himself to the family business into which he was marrying, as well as to begin a family.

==Death==
On August 16, 1920, while at bat, Chapman was struck in the head and killed by a pitch thrown by Carl Mays during a game against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. At the time, pitchers commonly dirtied balls with soil, licorice, and tobacco juice, and otherwise scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, or spiked them, giving a &quot;misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and, as it came over the plate, was very hard to see.&quot; Mays threw with a submarine delivery, and it was late afternoon. Eyewitnesses recounted that Chapman did not react to the pitch at all, presumably unable to see it. The sound of the ball striking Chapman&#x27;s skull was so loud that Mays thought it had hit the end of Chapman&#x27;s bat; he fielded the ball and threw to first base.

Home plate umpire Tommy Connolly, noticing that Chapman was bleeding from his left ear, screamed towards the stands for a doctor. Tris Speaker, who had been on deck, rushed to Chapman, as did several players from each team. Carl Mays merely stood on the mound. Chapman tried to walk, but his knees buckled. As he was helped off the field by his teammates, he mumbled &quot;I&#x27;m all right; tell Mays not to worry... ring...Katie&#x27;s ring,&quot; before falling unconscious. Chapman was taken to St. Lawrence Hospital, a short distance from the Polo Grounds, where he was diagnosed with a depressed skull fracture. Despite emergency surgery to relieve swelling on his brain, Chapman died at 4:40 a.m. the next day. His pregnant wife Katie, summoned from Cleveland by phone, arrived at 10:00 a.m. and fainted upon learning he had died.

Thousands of mourners attended Chapman&#x27;s funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland and he was buried at Lake View Cemetery.

Cleveland players wore black armbands for the remainder of the season. The Indians won the 1920 World Series and dedicated their victory to Chapman.

==Honors==
A bronze plaque was designed in Chapman&#x27;s memory, funded by donations from fans, was hung at League Park and was moved to Cleveland Stadium when the Indians moved there in 1946. Sometime in the early 1970s, however, it was removed for unknown reasons. In 2007 it was refurbished and made part of Progressive Field&#x27;s Heritage Park, which includes the Cleveland Guardians Hall of Fame and other exhibits from the team&#x27;s history. Chapman had been inducted into the team Hall of Fame in 2006, part of the first new induction class since 1972. A baseball field is dedicated to Ray Chapman in his hometown of Beaver Dam, Kentucky.

<text>The Scottish Football League Third Division was the fourth tier of the Scottish football league system between 1994 and 2013.

== History ==
The Scottish football league system had operated with three divisions in the Scottish Football League (SFL) from 1975. In 1994, as part of reconstruction to allow the admission of Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Ross County to the league, the SFL was recalibrated to give four divisions of 10 teams. The fourth tier was named the Third Division.

In 1998, the Premier Division (top flight) clubs broke away to form the Scottish Premier League (SPL). The Third Division continued as the fourth tier of the league system, but was now the third tier of the SFL. In 2013, the SFL and SPL merged to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). The SPFL named its fourth tier as Scottish League Two, which effectively replaced the Third Division.

==Competition==
The Third Division consisted of ten teams throughout its existence. From 1994 until 2005, each season the top two teams were promoted to the Second Division. From 2005 until 2013, only the champion was automatically promoted to the Second Division at the end of each season. The clubs that finished 2nd, 3rd and 4th entered a play-off with the 9th placed team of the Second Division.

There was no relegation from the Third Division.

The teams played each other four times with three points for a victory, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss.

<doc id="560690" wikidata="Q5337270" url="?curid=560690" title="Edgar A. Guest">
<text>Edgar Albert Guest (20 August 1881 – 5 August 1959) was a British-born American poet who became known as the People&#x27;s Poet. He was a munkey boy. His poems often had an inspirational and optimistic view of everyday life.

==Early life==
Guest was born in Birmingham, England in 1881. In 1891, his family moved from England to Detroit, Michigan, where Guest lived until he died.

==Career==
After he began at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; as a copy boy and then a reporter, his first poem appeared on 11 December 1898. He became a naturalized citizen in 1902. For 40 years, Guest was widely read throughout North America, and his sentimental, optimistic poems were in the same vein as the light verse of Nick Kenny, who wrote syndicated columns during the same decades.

From his first published work in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; until his death in 1959, Guest penned some 11,000 poems which were syndicated in some 300 newspapers and collected in more than 20 books, including &quot;A Heap o&#x27; Livin&quot;&#x27; (1916) and &quot;Just Folks&quot; (1923–1957). In 1952, Guest was made Poet Laureate of Michigan, the only poet to have been awarded the title until 2023, when the position was revived.

His popularity led to a weekly Detroit radio show which he hosted from 1931 until 1942, followed by a 1951 NBC television series, &quot;A Guest in Your House&quot;. He also had a thrice-weekly transcribed radio program that began 15 January 1941, and was sponsored by Land O&#x27;Lakes Creameries. The program featured singer Eddy Howard.

Guest was made a Freemason in Detroit, where he was a lifetime member of Ashlar Lodge No. 91. In honor of Guest&#x27;s devotion to the Craft, community, and humanity in general, the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Michigan established the Edgar A. Guest Award for lodges to present to non-Masons within the community who have demonstrated distinguished service to the community and their fellow man.

When Guest died in 1959, he was buried in Detroit&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery.

His grandniece Judith Guest is a novelist best known for &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1976).

==Reputation==
Guest&#x27;s work still occasionally appears in periodicals such as &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and some favorites, such as &quot;Myself&quot; and &quot;Thanksgiving,&quot; are still studied today. However, in one of the most quoted appraisals of his work, Dorothy Parker reputedly said: &quot;I&#x27;d rather flunk my Wassermann test than read a poem by Edgar Guest.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In 1924, American composer Gertrude Martin Rohrer used Guest&#x27;s text for her song &quot;Results and Roses&quot;.

Edgar Guest is a favorite poet of Edith Bunker from the TV show &quot;All in the Family&quot;. She quotes him in a few episodes, including &quot;Prisoner in the House&quot;, first broadcast on 4 January 1975.

Guest is mentioned several times in the eleventh book in Lemony Snicket&#x27;s &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, &quot;The Grim Grotto&quot;. Klaus Baudelaire recalls how he was once given a Hobson&#x27;s choice of doing the dishes or reading Guest&#x27;s poetry, and the villainous crew of Count Olaf&#x27;s submarine &quot;Carmelita&quot; wear badges depicting Guest (in contrast to the heroes&#x27; badges depicting Herman Melville). The book&#x27;s author goes out of his way to praise Melville and disparage Guest as a &quot;writer of limited skill, who wrote awkward, tedious poetry on hopelessly sentimental topics.&quot;

In the novel &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, the main character Robert Neville sardonically comments on his own internal monologue: &quot;The last man in the world is Edgar Guest&quot;.

Guest&#x27;s poem &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Be Done&quot; was recited by Idris Elba on the BBC&#x27;s Sports Personality of the Year Award on 16 December 2012 whilst celebrating Team GB and Paralympics GB winning the team award for 2012.

Guest&#x27;s poem &quot;The Epicure&quot; was reproduced in Mad #84 (January 1964) with new illustrations by Don Martin.

Guest&#x27;s poem &quot;See It Through,&quot; was used in a Chrysler 300 commercial.

Guest&#x27;s poem &quot;Don&#x27;t Quit&quot; was paraphrased in &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;, &quot;The Librarian,&quot; episode 9, season I.

Guest&#x27;s poem &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Be Done&quot; was used in an Audi commercial.

Tracey Gold did read Guest&#x27;s poem &quot;A Child of Mine&quot; during the funeral of Judith Barsi.

&quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Be Done&quot; inspired a parody, &quot;They Said That It Couldn&#x27;t Be Done&quot;, by comedian Benny Hill.

<doc id="560696" wikidata="Q7437801" url="?curid=560696" title="Scottish Junior Cup">
<text>The Scottish Junior Cup is an annual football competition organised by the Scottish Junior Football Association. The competition has been held every year since the inception of the SJFA on the 2nd October 1886 and, as of the 2023–24 edition, 112 teams compete in the tournament. The cup has an unseeded knockout format with no replays, semi-finals played over two legs, and the final usually played at a neutral venue of an SPFL club.

Since the 2006–07 season, the winner of the Junior Cup Final has qualified for the following season&#x27;s senior Scottish Cup. The competition is named the Clydebuilt Home Improvements Scottish Junior Cup for sponsorship reasons.

Darvel are the current holders, having defeated Arthurlie 2–1 in the final on 2 June 2024 at Broadwood Stadium to win the trophy for the first time.

== Format ==
The competition is open to all member clubs of Scottish Junior Football Association, and all clubs in tier 6 and below in the Scottish pyramid system on payment of entry fee, subject to the approval of the committee.

Matches which are tied after 90 minutes proceed directly to penalty kicks, and semi-finals take place over two legs. Prior to the 2020–21 season, drawn matches were replayed.

== History ==
The Cup has been competed for since the 1886–87 season, when Fairfield Govan became the first winners. The SJFA purchased an exact replica in 2007, to replace the original which was showing its age.

Auchinleck Talbot are the most successful club, winning the trophy 14 times to date, including three times in a row from 1986 to 1988 and 2018 to 2022 (no team won in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

The record attendance for a Junior Cup Final is 77,650 for the 1951 final between Petershill and Irvine Meadow XI.

In 2010, Linlithgow Rose lifted the Scottish Junior Cup for the fourth time in their history and third in a decade. They now join a small group of teams that have managed to lift the cup more than three times.

== Sponsorship ==
The cup&#x27;s long-term sponsor, the OVD Rum company, which, as of 2006, had an eighteen-year-long association with the competition, withdrew their backing before the start of the 2006–07 competition. Unlike most other sponsored contests whose names change often, OVD had become so ingrained into the Scottish Junior Cup that it was often simply referred to as the &quot;OVD Junior Cup&quot;. The Scottish Junior Football Association announced in 2006 that they would provide the sponsorship and prize money themselves, meaning the cup would be known simply as the &quot;Scottish Junior Cup&quot;. A new sponsor was found during the 2006–07 competition for the semi-finals and final - Scottish Citylink, a long-distance coach operator. The competition was sponsored by Emirates between 2009 and 2013. The tournament was without a sponsor in 2013–14, with Barr Construction sponsoring the final only, then the SJFA entered a partnership with Dementia Scotland for the latter stages of the 2014–15 competition.

The cup had been without a sponsor since ETHX Energy sponsored the 2015-16 competition, however in 2018 sportswear company Macron sponsored the tournament for three seasons.

<text>Wanda Aleksandra Landowska (5 July 1879 – 16 August 1959) was a Polish harpsichordist and pianist whose performances, teaching, writings and especially her many recordings played a large role in reviving the popularity of the harpsichord in the early 20th century. She was the first person to record Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; on the harpsichord in 1933. She became a naturalized French citizen in 1938.

==Life and career==
===Life in Europe===

Landowska was born in Warsaw to Jewish parents. Her father was a lawyer, and her mother was a linguist who translated Mark Twain into Polish. She began playing piano at the age of four, and studied at the Warsaw Conservatory with the senior Jan Kleczyński and Aleksander Michałowski. She was considered a child prodigy. 

She studied composition and counterpoint under Heinrich Urban in Berlin, and had lessons in Paris with Moritz Moszkowski. She began her performing career in Paris, where her recitals in that city and other European cities garnered praise from critics. She was interested in the music of J. S. Bach, whose works for harpsichord were included in her recitals by 1903, earning praise from Albert Schweitzer.

She decided to devote her career to the harpsichord rather than the piano, against the wishes of her friends, who thought she had a promising future as a pianist. In 1908–09, she toured Russia with a Pleyel harpsichord, similar to the 1889 model that the firm displayed at the Paris Exposition. After eloping with and marrying Polish folklorist and ethnomusicologist Henry Lew in 1900 in Paris, she taught piano at the Schola Cantorum there (1900–1912).

She later taught harpsichord at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik (1912–1919). When World War I started in 1914, she was interned on the grounds that she was a foreign national. In April 1919, a few months after WWI ended, her husband died in a car accident. She had her American debut in 1923, touring major cities with four Pleyel Grand Modele de Concert harpsichords, which were huge seven-and-a-half foot long instruments with foot pedal-controlled registers. These were large, heavily built harpsichords with a 16-foot stop (a set of strings an octave below normal pitch) and owed much to piano construction. 
Deeply interested in musicology, and particularly in the works of Bach, Couperin and Rameau, she toured the museums of Europe looking at original keyboard instruments; she acquired old instruments and had new ones made by Pleyel and Company at her request. Responding to criticism by fellow Bach specialist Pablo Casals, she once said: &quot;You play Bach your way, and I&#x27;ll play him &#x27;his&#x27; way.&quot;

A number of important new works were written for her: Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot; (&quot;Master Peter&#x27;s Puppet Show&quot;) marked the return of the harpsichord to the modern orchestra. Falla later wrote a harpsichord concerto for her, and Francis Poulenc composed his &quot;Concert champêtre&quot; for her. 

She taught at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1925 until 1928. In 1925, she established the École de Musique Ancienne based in Paris: from 1927, her home in Saint-Leu-la-Forêt became a center for the performance and study of old music. During this time Landowska frequented the salon of Natalie Clifford Barney, to both socialize and perform.

===Life in America===

When the German Army invaded France, Landowska fled with her student and domestic partner Denise Restout. After leaving Saint-Leu in 1940, sojourning in Banyuls-sur-Mer, a commune in southern France, where her friend, sculptor Aristide Maillol was living, they sailed from Lisbon to the United States. Believing the Nazi threat to be temporary she had left with only two suitcases. She arrived in New York on 7 December 1941, the date of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Her home in Saint-Leu was looted, and her instruments and manuscripts were stolen, so she arrived in the United States essentially with no assets.

Her 1942 performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; at New York&#x27;s Town Hall was the first occasion in the 20th century when the piece was played on the harpsichord, the instrument for which it had been written.

She settled in Lakeville, Connecticut in 1949, and re-established herself as a performer and teacher in the United States, touring extensively. Her last public performance was in 1954. Her partner, Denise Restout, was editor and translator of her writings on music, including &quot;Musique ancienne&quot;, and &quot;Landowska on Music&quot;, published posthumously in 1964.

She died at Lakeville on 16 August 1959.

==Reviews and opinions==
*&quot;Almost needless to say, the playing is full of vigorous gestures and individual ideas. She was no respecter of text and there are little repeats here and there which are no more indicated than they are necessary. Yet such matters seem something of an irrelevance, since they only reflect an attitude of the time adopted by a celebrated pioneer of the harpsichord revival in the twentieth century. No, what charms me in Landowska&#x27;s recital is her affecting poetic insight into Scarlatti&#x27;s music; she is not just rediscovering the proper conjunction of composer and instrument, she believes in it and feels it intensely.&quot;
*Sol Babitz stated that &quot;She always played the music &#x27;as written&#x27; with the result that a series of fast notes did not sound like &#x27;bundles of them&#x27; (North 1700) but like a sewing machine. Thanks to her wide influence this blight can be heard in her pupils to this day.&quot;
*&quot;Wanda Landowska&#x27;s harpsichord recital of last evening at the Town Hall was as stimulating as a needle shower. Indeed, the sound of that princely instrument, when it is played with art and fury, makes one think of golden rain and of how Danaë’s flesh must have tingled when she found herself caught out in just such a downpour….She played everything better than anybody else ever does. That is to say that the way she makes music is so deeply satisfactory that one has the feeling of a fruition, of a completeness at once intellectual and sensuously auditory beyond which it is difficult to imagine anything further.”

<doc id="560704" wikidata="Q725380" url="?curid=560704" title="The X Factor (album)">
<text>The X Factor is the tenth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 2 October 1995 through EMI Records. CMC International released the album in North America. It is the first of two albums by the band to include Blaze Bayley, formerly of Wolfsbane, as vocalist, replacing Bruce Dickinson who left the band following their previous tour to pursue a solo career. It also saw the departure of the band&#x27;s longtime producer Martin Birch, who retired shortly after the release of their previous album, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; (1992). The album takes a darker tone than the band&#x27;s first nine releases, due to the lyrics being based on personal issues surrounding Steve Harris at the time, who was in the midst of a divorce. This is reflected in the cover artwork, which graphically depicts the band&#x27;s mascot, Eddie, being vivisected by a machine.

==Background==

The album title came about at the start of the recording. According to producer Nigel Green: &quot;We all felt that the way things were progressing – the songs, Blaze&#x27;s new involvement, the sound, the commitment – the new album really would have that extra quality, that bit of magic, that &#x27;X Factor&#x27;. This became the working title for the album and we liked it, so we kept it. It is also very apt as this is our tenth studio album and &quot;X&quot; can bring up many images.&quot;

The cover art, depicting Eddie undergoing another lobotomy, was created by Hugh Syme. Due to the cover&#x27;s &quot;lifelike&quot; style, the band was forced to release the album in a reversible sleeve, with a less graphic view of Eddie from a distance.

The album was the last until 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Souls&quot; to use the classic variant of the band&#x27;s logo: every studio release from &quot;Virtual XI&quot; to &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; used an alternative that removed the extended ends of the &quot;R&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and both &quot;N&#x27;s&quot;.

&quot;The X Factor&quot; is also unusual in that it yielded several band compositions that did not make it onto the album. &quot;We actually ended up doing 14 songs and we used eleven,&quot; said Steve Harris, &quot;which is very unusual for us.&quot; The three songs that did not make the cut, &quot;I Live My Way&quot;, &quot;Justice of The Peace&quot; and &quot;Judgement Day,&quot; were released as B-sides to the album&#x27;s singles. The latter two would also be featured on the &quot;Best of the &#x27;B&#x27; Sides&quot; collection.

&quot;The X Factor&quot; was Maiden&#x27;s tenth consecutive UK top ten album but spent only four weeks on the chart – making it their shortest-staying studio album.

The band supported the album by touring. Much like the tour for the following album, &quot;Virtual XI&quot;, several dates in the United States were canceled as Bayley suffered from occasional vocal issues from the band&#x27;s heavy concert schedule.

==Song details==
&quot;Man on the Edge&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; were released as singles. Both of these songs, and &quot;Sign of the Cross,&quot; remained in Iron Maiden set lists following Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s return. Live versions of these songs with Dickinson on vocals can be found on &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; single and the live albums &quot;Death on the Road&quot;, &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; and &quot;Nights of the Dead&quot; respectively, while the same live takes of &quot;Man on the Edge&quot; and &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; were later re-released on Iron Maiden&#x27;s 2011 compilation album &quot;From Fear to Eternity&quot;.

&quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot; is based on the 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, adapted from Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Man on the Edge&quot; is based on the 1993 movie &quot;Falling Down&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is based on the William Golding novel of the same name. &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; is based on the Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. Live recordings of &quot;Blood on the World&#x27;s Hands&quot; and &quot;The Aftermath&quot; from the X Factor were issued as B-sides and also on the &quot;Best of the &#x27;B&#x27; Sides&quot; compilation.

Blaze Bayley later recorded a re-arranged version of &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; on the live album &quot;As Live as It Gets&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The X Factor&quot; was met with lukewarm responses from critics. AllMusic rated the album two stars out of five, stating that &quot;suffering from a lack of powerful riffs and tightly written songs, &quot;The X Factor&quot; is a lackluster latter-day album from Iron Maiden. Although the band doesn&#x27;t sound particularly bad on the record, they don&#x27;t sound inspired and there&#x27;s a noticeable lack of energy to the performances which makes the lack of imagination all the more apparent.&quot;

Sputnikmusic were somewhat more positive about the release, deeming the album &quot;a change for Iron Maiden, and a very important one at that&quot; as it &quot;paved the way for future albums of similar length&quot;. They also praised the &quot;often criticized&quot; Blaze Bayley, whose voice they claimed &quot;was perfect for the new release.&quot;

<doc id="560716" wikidata="Q638272" url="?curid=560716" title="Oklahoma City National Memorial">
<text>The Oklahoma City National Memorial is a memorial site in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, that honors the victims, survivors, rescuers, and all who were affected by the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. It is situated on the former site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was destroyed in the bombing. The building was located on NW 5th Street between N. Robinson Avenue and N. Harvey Avenue.

The national memorial was authorized on October 9, 1997, by President Bill Clinton&#x27;s signing of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. It was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day. The memorial is administered by Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, with National Park Service staff to help interpret the memorial for visitors.

The memorial was formally dedicated on April 19, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the bombing. The museum was dedicated and opened 10 months later on February 19, 2001.

==History==
On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a Ryder rental truck filled with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and exploded it. A total of 168 people were killed, including many children, and the entire north face of the building was destroyed.

Months after the attack, Mayor Ron Norick appointed a task force to look into the creation of a permanent memorial where the Murrah building once stood. The Task Force called for &#x27;a symbolic outdoor memorial&#x27;, a Memorial Museum, and for the creation of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. Six hundred and twenty four designs were submitted for the memorial. In July 1997 a design by Butzer Design Partnership, consisting of husband and wife Hans and Torrey Butzer, was chosen.

In October 1997, President Bill Clinton signed law creating the Oklahoma City National Memorial to be operated by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The total cost of the memorial was $29.1 million ($55,140,783.18 in 2023): $10 million for the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial, $7 million for the Memorial Museum, $5 million for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and the rest for other costs. The federal government appropriated $5 million for construction with the state of Oklahoma matching that amount. More than $17 million in private donations was raised.

On April 19, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the attack, the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial was dedicated. On February 19, 2001, the Memorial Museum was dedicated. In 2004 it was transferred from the trust, to the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, designating it an affiliated area of the National Park System. The Oklahoma City National Memorial since its opening has seen over 4.4 million visitors to the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial and 1.6 million visitors to the Memorial Museum. The Memorial has an average of 350,000 visitors per year.

==Memorial features==


The Outdoor Symbolic Memorial consists of the following segments on 3.3 acres (13,000 m2) and is accessible day or night.

* The Gates of Time: monumental twin bronze gates frame the moment of destruction – 9:02 – and mark the formal entrances to the Outdoor Memorial. 9:01, found on the eastern gate, represents the last moments of peace, while its opposite on the western gate, 9:03, represents the first moments of recovery. Both time stamps are inscribed on the interior of the monument, facing each other and the Reflecting Pool.

:The outside of each gate bears this inscription:

&quot;We come here to remember&quot;
&quot;Those who were killed, those who survived and those who changed forever.&quot;
&quot;May all who leave here know the impact of violence.&quot;
&quot;May this memorial offer comfort, strength, peace, hope and serenity.&quot;
* Reflecting Pool: a thin layer of water flows over polished black granite to form the pool, which runs east to west down the center of the Memorial (also see reflecting pool) on what was once Fifth Street. Although the pool is flowing, visitors are able to see a mirror image of themselves in the water. Visitors seeing their reflections are said to be seeing &quot;someone changed forever by what happened here.&quot;
* Field of Empty Chairs: one hundred and sixty-eight empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, and stone represent those who lost their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on the site where the Murrah Building once stood. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person&#x27;s chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers&#x27; chairs beneath their mothers&#x27; names.
* Survivors&#x27; Wall: the only remaining original portions of the Murrah Building are the north and east walls, known as the Survivors&#x27; Wall. The wall has several panels of granite salvaged from the Murrah Building itself, inscribed with the names of more than 600 survivors from the building and the surrounding area, many of whom were injured in the blast.
* Survivor Tree: an American elm on the north side of the Memorial that was heavily damaged by the bomb, but survived. Hundreds of seeds from the Survivor Tree are planted annually and the resulting saplings are distributed each year on the anniversary of the bombing. Thousands of Survivor Trees are growing in public and private places all over the U.S.
* The Memorial Fence: a chain link fence was installed around the area that is now the Reflecting Pool and the Field of Empty Chairs to protect the site from damage and visitors from injury. The Fence stood for more than four years, becoming notable as the place where visitors left stuffed animals, poems, keychains, and other items as tributes. During the construction of the Outdoor Memorial, 210 feet (64 m) of the Fence was moved to the west side of the Memorial, along the 9:03 side or the &#x27;healing&#x27; side. The remainder of the Fence is in storage. Visitors may still leave small items along and in the Fence; the mementos are periodically collected, cataloged, and stored.
* Rescuers&#x27; Orchard: a grove of Oklahoma redbuds (Oklahoma&#x27;s state tree), Amur Maple, Chinese Pistache, and Bosque Elm trees are planted on the lawn around the Survivor Tree. The trees represent the rescuers who came to the aid of the survivors; hence the rescuers&#x27; orchard surrounds the survivor tree. The non-native species represent those rescuers who came from outside Oklahoma to help.
* Children&#x27;s Area: more than 5,000 hand-painted tiles, from all over the United States and Canada, were made by children and sent to Oklahoma City after the bombing in 1995. Most are stored in the Memorial&#x27;s Archives, and a sampling of tiles is on the wall in the Children&#x27;s Area. Chalkboards provide a place where children can draw and share their feelings. The Children&#x27;s Area is north of the 9:03 gate, on the west side of the Museum.
* Journal Record Building: north of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which formerly housed the offices of &quot;The Journal Record&quot;. It now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, which features numerous exhibits and artifacts related to the Oklahoma City bombing. 
* Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza: located just south of the Field of Empty Chairs, above the underground parking garage, is the raised Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza. An original part of the federal building, the plaza had a garden and seating areas, as well as a playground for the daycare center. Visitors to the Memorial can walk across the plaza, where the original flagpole is used for the American flag.

==Adjacent memorials==

Two churches were located across the street from the Murrah Building. Both were heavily damaged by the blast. Each church was repaired and both constructed memorials on their property. While not part of the official memorial they are open to the public.

* Heartland Chapel: across the street from the 9:01 gate is an open air wooden chapel erected by First United Methodist Church of Oklahoma City. The altar is made from church stones damaged by the bombing. A substantial portion of the funding for the chapel was provided by the Jewish community.
* And Jesus Wept: across the street from the 9:03 gate is a sculpture of Jesus weeping erected by St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches built in the city. Jesus faces away from the devastation, covering his face with his hand. In front of Jesus is a wall with 168 gaps in it, representing the voids left by each life lost.

<text>The new wave of new wave (NWONW) was a term coined by music journalists to describe a subgenre of the British alternative rock scene in the early 1990s, in which bands displayed post-punk and new wave influences, particularly from bands such as the Clash, Blondie, Devo, Squeeze, XTC, Wire, and the Stranglers. 

==History==
The associated bands generally played guitar-based rock music often accompanied by keyboards. The movement was short-lived, and several of the bands involved were later linked with the more commercially successful Britpop, which it immediately preceded, and the NWONW was described by John Harris of &quot;The Guardian&quot; (one of the journalists who first coined the term) as &quot;Britpop without the good bits&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; played a major part in promoting and covering the genre, and promoted the &quot;On&quot; event, which featured many of the bands they had labelled NWONW.

==Notable examples==
Record label Fierce Panda&#x27;s first release, &quot;Shagging in the Streets&quot;, was a tribute to the scene, featuring S*M*A*S*H, Done Lying Down, These Animal Men, and others. Associated bands have included Elastica, S*M*A*S*H, Menswear, Sleeper, Echobelly, Shed Seven, These Animal Men, and Compulsion.

==Legacy==
Robert Christgau identified the mid-1990s NWONW movement as the peak of a new wave revival that has continued on and off since, stating in 1996, &quot;1994 was the top of a curve we can&#x27;t be certain we&#x27;ve reached the bottom of&quot;.

<text>Sovnarkhoz (, &quot;sovet narodnogo khozyaystva&quot;, &quot;Council of National Economy&quot;), usually translated as Regional Economic Soviet, was an organization of the Soviet Union to manage a separate economic region.
Sovnarkhozes were subordinated to the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy.

Sovnarkhozes were introduced by Nikita Khrushchev in May 1957 in an attempt to combat the centralization and departmentalism of ministries. The USSR was initially divided in 105 economic regions, with sovnarkhozes being operational and planning management; the number was later reduced to 47. Simultaneously, a large number of ministries were shut down.

<text>Émile Derlin Zinsou (23 March 1918 – 28 July 2016) was a Beninese politician and physician who was the President of Dahomey (now Benin) from 17 July 1968 until 10 December 1969, supported by the military regime that took power in 1967. Zinsou was present at the signing of the treaty that formed the African Union on 12 July 2000 in Togo.

==Biography==
===Early life and medical career===
Zinsou was born in Ouidah on 23 March 1918. He was educated at Porto-Novo and the Ecole William Ponty in Senegal. He studied medicine at the Dakar Medical College and qualified as a doctor. Zinsou was a physician in the French army from 1939 to 1940. Afterwards he operated a private practice and began to become involved in colonial politics.

===Political career and presidency===
Zinsou was one of the founders of Dahomey&#x27;s first political party, the Union Progressiste Dahoméenne (UPD). He was an assistant to Sourou-Migan Apithy in 1945 and was a deputy to the French National Assembly. From 1947 to 1953 he was vice president of the Assembly to the French Union. During this time the UPD splintered into ethnic/regional factions led by Apithy, Hubert Maga, and Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Zinsou merged the remainder of the UPD with Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s Bloc Populaire Africain to form the Union Démocratique Dahoméenne.

He served in the French senate from 1955 to 1958, joining the Independents d&#x27;Outre-Mer. While a senator, Zinsou developed a close bond with future President of Senegal Léopold Sédar Senghor. Zinsou was a deputy to Dahomey&#x27;s Territorial (later National) Assembly and was Minister of Commerce during the &quot;loi-cadre&quot; liberalization period of 1958 to 1959. He did not want to see the breakup of France&#x27;s African colonies after independence and was the secretary of the Dakar-based Parti du Regroupement Africain (PRA). Zinsou broke with Apithy in 1959 after Apithy backed out of the idea of a Mali Federation, one of the PRA&#x27;s chief proposals.

After Dahomey achieved independence, Zinsou became the ambassador to France. Under Maga, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1962 to an abrupt dismissal in 1963. He was Francophone Africa&#x27;s candidate for the role of the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity in 1964. In early 1965 he was an advisor to the South African Anglo-American Corporation in Paris. Zinsou was again foreign minister from late December 1965 to 1967 in General Christophe Soglo&#x27;s administration.

Following the 1967 coup and the electoral boycott in 1968, Zinsou was the military&#x27;s pick for president and was sworn in on 17 July 1968. This was quite unusual because he was a staunch anti-militarist. As President, Zinsou promoted anti-smuggling policies, countermeasures against strikes, and a more efficient tax collecting system. This upset some people and military officers were infuriated by his independent actions. As a result, his chief of staff Maurice Kouandété deposed him on 10 December 1969. Although Zinsou was injured when machine guns fired on the presidential palace, two of his bodyguards were murdered. Zinsou received a mere 3 percent of votes in the 1970 presidential election and rejected an offer to join the presidential council. Instead, he opted to move to Paris.

===Later life and death===
He is said to have opposed the one-party Marxist policies of Mathieu Kérékou, who ruled Benin from 1972 to 1990. On 17 March 1975, following an attempted coup led by Janvier Assogba, Zinsou was accused of being complicit. He was sentenced to death in absentia.

On 16 January 1977 an attempted coup d&#x27;état took place in Benin with a group of armed men led by renowned French mercenary &quot;Colonel&quot; Bob Denard. The operation, called &quot;Opération Crevette&quot; (or Operation Shrimp), was mounted in order to oust leftist President Mathieu Kérékou. In his autobiography, Bob Denard has mentioned that Emile Derlin Zinsou was to be reinstated in power in the aftermath of the coup, and that he was in fact waiting on board the mercenaries&#x27; plane that fled the country when the coup attempt failed. Zinsou has often denied being linked to the coup, but refused to comment on Denard&#x27;s writings.

In 1990, Zinsou returned to Benin after his 17-year exile. He opposed the new constitution in the referendum of 2 December 1990 but was unsuccessful. Zinsou was a mediator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during that country&#x27;s civil war in the late 1990s; he arrived in Kinshasa on 20 September 1999, along with fellow mediator Padre Matteo Zuppi, and met with President Laurent-Désiré Kabila.

Zinsou was, as of 2007, the Honorary President of the National Union for Democracy and Progress political party. In January 2006, he announced his support for Yayi Boni in the March 2006 presidential election. Zinsou, like other world leaders of the time, contributed to a disc left on the surface of the Moon by the astronauts of Apollo 11. Zinsou died in his home on 28 July 2016 in Cotonou, Benin. He was 98 years old.

<doc id="560728" wikidata="Q702891" url="?curid=560728" title="Knox-class frigate">
<text>The 46 &quot;Knox&quot;-class frigates were the largest, last, and most numerous of the US Navy&#x27;s second-generation anti-submarine warfare (ASW) escorts. Originally laid down as ocean escorts (formerly called destroyer escorts), they were all redesignated as frigates on 30 June 1975, in the 1975 ship reclassification plan and their hull designation changed from &#x27;DE&#x27; to &#x27;FF&#x27;. The &quot;Knox&quot; class was the Navy&#x27;s last destroyer-type design with a steam turbine powerplant.

Due to their unequal comparison to destroyers then in service (larger size with lower speed and only a single propeller and 5-inch gun), they became known to a generation of destroyermen as &quot;McNamara&#x27;s Folly&quot;, a jab at then-Secretary of the Defense Robert McNamara.

These ships were retired from the US Navy at the end of the Cold War due to their relatively high running costs, a declining defense budget, and the need for ships with a more advanced anti-submarine capability. None of the ships served more than 23 years in the US Navy, and by 1994, all of the class had been retired, although some remain in service with foreign nations such as Egypt, Taiwan, Thailand, and Mexico.

==Design==
Designated SCB No. 199C, the &quot;Knox&quot; was planned as the follow-on to the twin 5&quot; gun-armed Garcia class frigates and the Tartar missile-equipped s. Their initial design incorporated the prior classes&#x27; pressure-fired boilers in a similar-sized hull designed around the massive bow-mounted AN/SQS-26 sonar, with increased endurance and reduced crew size. Anti-submarine armament was to consist of RUR-5 ASROC anti submarine missiles together with the QH-50 DASH drone helicopter, while defensive armament was to be the RIM-46 Sea Mauler short range anti-aircraft missile backed up by a single 5-inch/54 caliber Mark 42 gun.

The design soon ran into problems however, with the US Navy deciding to switch to conventional boilers, requiring a redesign, and the ships became longer and heavier in order to accommodate the less compact power plants. Furthermore, Sea Mauler was cancelled in 1965, leaving the ships to complete without any anti-aircraft system except the 5&quot; gun.

The steam plant for these ships consists of two Combustion Engineering or Babcock &amp; Wilcox &quot;D&quot; type boilers, each equipped with a high-pressure (supercharger) forced draught air supply system, with a plant working pressure of and superheat and rated at driving a single screw. This gives them a speed of .

The ships were designed primarily as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) platforms. Their main anti-submarine sensor was the large bow-mounted AN/SQS-26CX low-frequency scanning sonar, operating as an active sonar at a frequency of about 3.5 kHz and passively at 1.5–4 kHz. The active modes of operation included direct path, to a range of about , bottom bounce, and convergence zone, which could give ranges of up to about , well outside the capability of ASROC, and requiring the use of a helicopter to exploit. An eight-round ASROC launcher (with 16 missiles carried) was fitted between the gun turret and the bridge, backed up by four fixed Mark 32 anti-submarine torpedo tubes. A flight deck and hangar for operating the DASH drone helicopter was fitted aft.

==Construction==
Ten ships were authorized in Fiscal Year 1964, sixteen in 1965, and ten each for FYs 1966, 67 and 68; six were canceled in 1968, and four more in 1969. While the FY64 and FY65 ships were ordered from four different shipyards, later ships (DE-1078 onwards) were all ordered from Avondale Shipyards in order to cut costs. These ships were built on a production line, with prefabricated modules being assembled upside down, welded together and then rotated into an upright position. They were originally commissioned as destroyer escorts (DEs) 1052–1097 in 1969–1974, but were redesignated as frigates (FF) on 30 June 1975.

The lead ship of the class, , was laid down 5 October 1965, and commissioned 12 April 1969, at the Todd Shipyards in Seattle, Washington.

==Modifications==
The and subsequent ships of the class were modified to enable them to serve as flagships. The primary change was a slightly different arrangement of the &quot;Officer&#x27;s Country&quot; staterooms with additional staterooms in a new 01 level structure which replaced the open deck between the boats. The stateroom on the port side under the bridge was designated as a &quot;flag&quot; stateroom, with additional staterooms for flag staff when serving as a flagship. These ships have been referred to as the &quot;Joseph Hewes&quot;-sub-class .

The &quot;Knox&quot; class had been criticized for deck wetness and there were a number of instances of damage to the forward weapons mounts in heavy seas, so the class were refitted with &quot;hurricane bows&quot; beginning with in 1979. The modification heightened the bow section, adding bulwarks and spray strakes to prevent burrowing into on-coming seas and to better protect the forecastle armament.

Twenty-five ships of the class (DE-1052, 1056, 1063–1071 and 1078–1097) were refitted with the AN/SQS-35(V) Independent Variable Depth Sonar, an active sonar operating at about 13 kHz. The IVDS&#x27; sonar transducers were packaged within a 2-ton fiberglass-enclosed &quot;fish&quot; containing the sonar array and a gyro-compass/sensor package launched by the massive 13V Hoist from a stern compartment, located just beneath the main deck, to depths of up to . The IVDS could take advantage of water layer temperature conditions in close-range (less than ) submarine detection, tracking and fire-control. The AN/SQS-35 &quot;fish&quot; was later modified to tow an AN/SQR-18A TACTASS passive towed array sonar. The DASH drone proved unreliable, and following its withdrawal in 1973, the ships&#x27; helicopter facilities were expanded to accommodate the larger, manned, Kaman Seasprite LAMPS 1 helicopter.

Thirty-one ships (DE-1052–1069 and 1071–1083) were fitted with an eight-round Basic Point Defence Missile System (BPDMS) launcher for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles in place of the cancelled Sea Mauler short range surface to air missile system, while was fitted with a NATO Sea Sparrow (IBPDMS) launcher. It was planned to equip the other 14 ships with Sea Chaparral, based on the Sidewinder air-to-air missile, but this plan was abandoned. Most ships were refitted with a Phalanx CIWS aft during the 1980s, replacing the Sea Sparrow launcher.

In the 1970s, several ships received an interim surface warfare upgrade allowing Standard ARM anti-radar missiles to be fired from the ships&#x27; ASROC launcher. Later, all ships were modified to launch Harpoon anti-ship missiles from the ASROC launcher, which could carry two Harpoons, with two more carried in the ships&#x27; ASROC magazine.

== &quot;Baleares&quot; class ==
Five modified ships were built in Spain for the Spanish Navy as the Baleares-class. In these ships, the Sea Sparrow launcher and helicopter facilities were replaced by a Mk 22 launcher for sixteen Standard surface-to-air missiles, giving them a limited area air-defence capability.

== &quot;Chi Yang&quot; class ==

In the 1990s, the US agreed to transfer eight &quot;Knox&quot;-class frigates to the Republic of China Navy (ROCN). The ROCN, anticipating future difficulties in maintaining the steam plants on these ships, originally contemplated an ambitious plan to replace these plants with diesel engines. However, due to budget considerations and the acquisition of newer ships, this plan is now believed to have been shelved. These frigates were renamed the &quot;Chi Yang&quot;-class and assigned to the ROCN 168 Patrol Squadron.

By 2005, the ROCN had removed several systems from the retired upgraded World War II-vintage destroyers and transferred them to seven of the &quot;Chi Yang&quot; class. These systems include SM-1MR Standard missile in box launchers, H-930 modular combat system, DA-08/2 air/surface search radar, and STIR-180 illuminating radar. Each &quot;Chi Yang&quot;-class frigate has 10 SM-1 missiles installed in two forward twin box launchers on top of the helicopter hangar, and two triple box launchers installed between the stack and the hangar, pointing to port and starboard. &quot;Chi Yang&quot; (FFG-932) did not receive the upgrade.

The ASW capability of the &quot;Chi Yang&quot; class is provided by its SQS-26 bow-mounted sonar, SQS-35(v) VDS, SQR-18(v)1 passive TAS, MD500 ASW helicopter, Mk-16 8-cell Harpoon/RUR-5 ASROC box launcher, and four Mk46 torpedoes. While on ASW patrol, the frigate will carry two Harpoon SSMs and six ASROCs in its Mk-16 box launcher.

There are some speculations that these ships will probably be upgraded with Hsiung Feng III missiles.

Regarding to the outdated battle system onboard and the ageing ships, the class is expected to be replaced by the newly built Taiwanese Light Frigate.

<text>Hans Zinsser (November 17, 1878 – September 4, 1940) was an American physician, bacteriologist, and prolific author. 
The author of over 200 books and medical articles, he was also a published poet. Some of his verses were published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;.
His 1940 publication, &quot;As I Remember Him: the Biography of R.S.&quot;, won one of the early National Book Awards, the sixth and last annual award for Nonfiction voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.

He is remembered especially for his 1935 book, &quot;Rats, Lice and History&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The son of German immigrants, Zinsser was born in New York City in 1878. He attended Timothy Dwight School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University in 1899 and completed both a master&#x27;s degree and a doctorate in medicine there in 1903.

In 1905, he married Ruby Handforth Kunz, eldest daughter of the mineralogist, George Frederick Kunz, and they had two children, Hans Handforth and Gretel Zinsser, and they all lived in Boston.

===Career===

After holding a series of academic medicine positions, Zinsser became an associate professor at Stanford University in 1910. In 1913, he moved to a position at his &quot;alma mater&quot;. At Columbia, he was the doctoral advisor of Rebecca Lancefield, although he did not permit her to physically work in his laboratory due to her gender. Ten years later, Zinsser was hired by Harvard Medical School, where he stayed — except for service in the US Army Medical Corps in World War I — until his death.
Zinsser taught as an exchange professor and worked with the American Red Cross in France, Russia, Serbia and China, and was noted for his work in typhus and immunology. He became a lieutenant colonel in the US Army and served overseas during World War I. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which read as follows &quot;For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services-- while acting as Sanitation Inspector of the Second Army he organized, perfected and administered with extraordinary and exceptional success a plan of military sanitation and epidemic-disease control.&quot; Zinsser also received another military citation for taking exceptional risks to minister to wounded soldiers while under direct enemy fire. He was also awarded the Order of St. Sava of Serbia and the Legion of Honour in France.

Zinsser&#x27;s scientific work focused on bacteriology and immunology and he is most associated with typhus, especially the form called Brill–Zinsser disease, his namesake. He isolated the typhus bacterium and developed a protective vaccine. He wrote several books about biology and bacteria, notably &quot;Rats, Lice and History&quot; (1935), a &quot;biography&quot; of typhus fever. Zinsser had a strong influence on the work of Albert Coons (1912–1978), who developed the technique of immunohistochemistry. Zinsser was a mentor to, and colleague of, John Franklin Enders, who was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (together with Frederick Chapman Robbins and Thomas Huckle Weller).

Zinsser was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1923, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1924, and the American Philosophical Society in 1937. 
Zinsser succumbed to acute leukemia in 1940. He is interred in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

Gallery Place is located in Northwest Washington, with entrances at 7th and F, 7th and H, and 9th and G Streets. The station&#x27;s only street elevator is north of F Street on the east side of 7th Street. The station, which is beneath Capital One Arena, serves that arena and the surrounding Chinatown and Penn Quarter neighborhoods in downtown Washington.

==Station layout==
Like other downtown transfer stations, Gallery Place has a two-level configuration. However, unlike Metro Center and L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, where the platforms cross centrally, the Green and Yellow Line platforms are located near the east end of the station, resulting in an off-balance layout. This is a result of the Green and Yellow Lines&#x27; location below 7th Street NW, while the Red Line curves southeast heading towards Judiciary Square and Union Station.

Plans to add a pedestrian tunnel connecting Gallery Place with Metro Center have long been in the works. The &quot;Gallery Place/Chinatown - Metro Center Pedestrian Passageway Tunnel Study&quot; was completed in July 2005.

==History==

Service began on December 15, 1976, as part of the original Red Line that ran from Farragut North to Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood. The opening of the station was delayed by a court order over lack of accessibility for all (it was originally supposed to open with the rest of the first stations on March 27, 1976). WMATA provided assurance that such access would be available by June 1, 1977.

Yellow Line service began on April 30, 1983, extending service to the Pentagon and National Airport stations. An abstract wall sculpture, &quot;The Yellow Line&quot; by Constance Fleures, was installed in 1989 on the lower-level platform, Green Line service began in 1991, adding service (at the time) to U Street and Anacostia.

Originally named Gallery Place after the nearby National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian American Art Museum, the station was renamed Gallery Place–Chinatown in 1986 (although the station&#x27;s signage was not replaced until 1990). In 2000, a sculpture entitled &quot;The Glory of the Chinese Descendants&quot; by Foon Sham, was installed over the 7th and H Street entrance at the mezzanine level. The sculpture depicts a large Chinese-style fan above a bowl of rice. The station reverted to its original name, Gallery Place, on November 3, 2011, with &quot;Chinatown&quot; listed as a subtitle.

This station has been a testing ground for new features in Metro stations. In 1993, the station was one of the first Metro stations to receive tactile edging on its platforms. Since 2004, the station has been the site of testing for new signage. As a result, there is far more signage in this station than most others, including lighted signs, as well as signage that isn&#x27;t found anywhere else in the system. In 2007, red LEDs were tested for the platform edge lights on the upper level. Orange LEDs were tested at the platform edge on the lower level, before being replaced by red LEDs in 2008. In 2017, WMATA added yellow stickers on the platform floors to remind riders where the end of six-car trains stop, to help riders avoid being in the area near the end of the platform behind where the last car of the train stops.

The station was closed from January 15–21, 2021, because of security concerns due to the 2021 Inauguration.

<text>Robert Změlík (, born 18 April 1969 in Prostějov) is a Czech track and field athlete who won a gold medal in Olympic decathlon in 1992.

His personal best in decathlon was 8627 points (1992), in Heptathlon 6228 points (1997), both former national records. Změlík&#x27;s Olympic success was influential for two other Czech decathletes and world record holders, Tomáš Dvořák and Roman Šebrle.

He was a frequent competitor at the Hypo-Meeting in Götzis, Austria, participating in 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1995. He made the podium for the first time in the 1991 Hypo-Meeting, taking second place with a score of 8346 points, then had his first win at the 1992 Hypo-Meeting, where he set a career-best score.

<text>Kennesaw Battlefield Park preserves a Civil War battleground of the Atlanta Campaign, and also contains Kennesaw Mountain. It is located at 900 Kennesaw Mountain Drive, between Marietta and Kennesaw, Georgia. The name &quot;Kennesaw&quot; derives from the Cherokee Indian &quot;Gah-nee-sah&quot; meaning &quot;cemetery&quot; or burial ground. The area was designated as a U.S. historic district on October 15, 1966.

== History ==
The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, fought here between Generals William Tecumseh Sherman of the Union army and Joseph E. Johnston of the Confederate army, took place between June 18, 1864, and July 2, 1864. Sherman&#x27;s army consisted of 100,000 men, 254 cannons and 35,000 horses, while Johnston&#x27;s army had only 50,000 men and 187 cannons. Johnston had successfully contrived to block Sherman&#x27;s advance with another defensive position, and this time Sherman tried a direct frontal assault. Much of the battle took place not on Kennesaw Mountain itself, but on a spur of Little Kennesaw Mountain known now as Pigeon Hill, and the area to its south around Cheatham Hill. A total of 5,350 soldiers died during the battle, which was deemed a Confederate victory, but Johnston&#x27;s army nonetheless retired.

== Park ==
Established as Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Site on February 18, 1917, it was transferred from the War Department on August 10, 1933, and redesignated a national military park on June 26, 1935. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park is a National Battlefield that preserves a Civil War battleground of the Atlanta Campaign. There are three battlefield areas: In front of the Visitor Center, off Burnt Hickory Road and a major site at Cheatham Hill (commonly known as the Dead Angle). At the southern tip of the park, Peter Valentine Kolb&#x27;s farm house, where a minor battle was fought, has been restored to its original condition. The Visitor Center contains an information desk, museum, and a theater which screens movies about the battle fought there. While walking some of the of interpretive hiking trails, historic earthworks, cannon emplacements, and various interpretive signs can be seen. There are three monuments representing some of the states who fought here - Illinois, Texas, and Georgia. Kennesaw Mountain is above sea level. It is approximately a gain in elevation from the Visitor Center to the mountain&#x27;s summit. The hike up is approximately on the road and on the trail.

== Mission ==
Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield was authorized for protection by the U.S. War Department in 1917 and was transferred to the Department of the Interior as a unit of the National Park System in 1933. The battlefield includes the site of some of the heaviest fighting of the Atlanta Campaign of the Civil War. The battlefield was set aside as an important cultural property dedicated to public inspiration and interpretation of the significant historic events that occurred here.

With the expansion of urban sprawl from nearby Atlanta, Georgia, concerns have been raised that the preserved areas of the park may be in danger from overuse and/or misuse.

<doc id="560749" wikidata="Q61357" url="?curid=560749" title="Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner">
<text>Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner (8 November 1834, Berlin25 April 1882, Leipzig) was a German astrophysicist who studied optical illusions. He was also an early psychical investigator.
==Biography==
From 1872 he held the chair of astrophysics at Leipzig University. He wrote numerous papers on photometry and spectrum analysis in Poggendorff&#x27;s &quot;Annalen&quot; and &quot;Berichte der k. sächsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften&quot;, two works on celestial photometry (&quot;Grundzüge einer allgemeinen Photometrie des Himmels&quot;, Berlin, 1861, 4to, and &quot;Photometrische Untersuchungen&quot;, Leipzig, 1865, 8vo), and a curious book, &quot;Ueber die Natur der Cometen&quot; (Leipzig, 1872, 3rd ed. 1883).

He discovered the Zöllner illusion where lines that are parallel appear diagonal. He also successfully proved Christian Doppler&#x27;s theory on the effect of motion of the color of stars, and the resulting shift of absorption lines, via the invention of a very sensitive spectroscope which he named &quot;Reversionspectroscope&quot;. He had shown also that the red-shift was in addition caused by variation in the stars&#x27; lights intensities with the help of his &quot;Astrophotometer&quot;.

In 1867 he made the first measurement of the Sun&#x27;s apparent magnitude, using a particular &quot;telescope / photometer&quot; he designed. The instrument was able to superimpose two images, one from a small telescope and the second from a reference lamp. During daytime he dimmed the image of the Sun (using polarizers and diaphragms) and compared it to the lamp. During nighttime, the lamp was dimmed and compared to bright stars. He estimated the visual magnitude of the Sun to be -26.66, an extraordinary result for the time. Today&#x27;s accepted value is -26.74. This measure is very difficult, since the flux difference between the Sun and Capella (one of the bright stars he used) is roughly 50 &quot;billion&quot; times.

This work was pivotal for astrophysics - leading to the discovery that star&#x27;s brightness varies wildly among different stars, and also that the Sun is brighter than the vast majority of nearby stars.

The lunar crater Zöllner is named in his honor.

In 1934, botanist Josef Velenovský published a genus of fungi named &quot;Zoellneria&quot; (in the family Sclerotiniaceae) and named in Zöllner&#x27;s honour. 
Also several other plant species, have been named in his honour including; &quot;Alstroemeria zoellneri&quot;, &quot;Baccharis zoellneri&quot;, &quot;Chenopodium zoellneri&quot; and &quot;Pseudolucia zoellneri&quot;.

==Spiritualism==

Zöllner first became interested in spiritualism in 1875 when he visited the scientist William Crookes in England. Zöllner wanted a physical scientific explanation for the phenomena and came to the conclusion that physics of a four-dimensional space may explain spiritualism. Zöllner attempted to demonstrate that spirits are four-dimensional and set up his own séance experiments with the medium Henry Slade which involved slate-writing, tying knots on string, recovering coins from sealed boxes and the interlinking of two wooden rings. These experiments occurred in November and December 1877 at Zöllner&#x27;s home in Leipzig. He invited the scientists Wilhelm Eduard Weber, Gustav Fechner, Wilhelm Scheibner and Wilhelm Wundt to some of the sittings.

The experiments were recorded by Zöllner in a book titled &quot;Transcendental Physics&quot; in 1878. According to Zöllner some of the experiments were a success. However, critics have suggested that the medium Henry Slade was a fraud who performed trickery in the experiments. Wilhelm Wundt who attended one of the séances, claimed that the conditions and controls were unsatisfactory. He also found the German grammatical errors on the slates suspicious as Slade was an English speaker.

Slade failed the experiment regarding the interlinking of two wooden rings. Instead, it was discovered that the two rings were passed onto a table leg. This impressed Zöllner but magicians noted that such a feat is easily explainable by trick methods.

In 1879, Hermann Ulrici brought Zollner&#x27;s experiments to the attention of scientists in Germany by describing them in an academic journal. This caused a heated controversy. Wundt published a rejoinder to Ulrici, denouncing the experiments and spiritualism as non-scientific. Enraged, Zöllner attacked Wundt and threatened him with a lawsuit. Zöllner went as far as claiming that Wundt was possessed by evil spirits.

George Stuart Fullerton, the secretary of the Seybert Commission, claimed that Zöllner had an &quot;unsound mind&quot; at the time of the experiments.

Carl Willmann, an inventor of magical apparatus, strongly suspected that Slade had cheated. In the case of sealed slates, he suggested they could have easily been opened by a thin wire.

Psychical researcher Hereward Carrington in his book &quot;The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism&quot; (1907) revealed fraudulent methods (with diagrams of the rope tricks) that Slade may have utilized in the experiments. Psychologist Ray Hyman has noted:

:In the case of Zöllner&#x27;s investigations of Slade, not only do we know that Slade was exposed before and after his sessions with Zöllner, but also there is ample reason to raise questions about the adequacy of the investigation. Carrington (1907), Podmore (1963), and Mrs. Sidgwick (1886-87) are among a number of critics who have uncovered flaws and loopholes in Zöllner&#x27;s sittings with Slade.

Science writer Martin Gardner also exposed the tricks of Slade with diagrams and commented that &quot;Zöllner did some good work in spectrum analysis, but he was supremely ignorant of conjuring methods. As a consequence he was badly taken in, I&#x27;m afraid, by Henry Slade.&quot;

<text>Jorja Fox (born July 7, 1968) is an American actress. She first came to prominence with a recurring role in the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot; as Dr. Maggie Doyle from 1996 to 1999. This was followed by another critical success in the recurring role of Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano in the NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 2000. She portrayed Sara Sidle in the CBS police procedural crime-drama &quot;&quot;, both as a regular (2000–2007, 2010–2015) and recurring (2008–2010) cast member. She reprised the role in the sequel &quot;&quot;, which premiered on October 6, 2021.

==Early life==
Fox was born in New York City to Montreal-born parents Edward and Marilyn Fox and is of French-Canadian, Belgian and Irish descent. She was raised on a narrow barrier island in Melbourne Beach, Florida. She has an older brother, Jeff. She describes herself as being overweight while growing up, with a prominent gap between her teeth. By her 20s, she observed that neither her wisdom teeth nor braces had appreciably helped, and Fox said &quot;forget it.&quot;

After attending Melbourne High School for two years, she began a modeling career after winning a local contest. She subsequently enrolled as a drama student at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York City, under the tutelage of actor William Hickey.

==Career==
Fox had minor roles in films and television series, including the opening scene of a 1993 episode of the NBC legal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Fox&#x27;s big break was a recurring role in the third, fourth and fifth seasons (1996–99) of the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;. She played Dr. Maggie Doyle, a lesbian, no-nonsense and vegetarian emergency intern.

Fox appeared in &quot;The Puppy Episode: Part 2&quot;, the April 30, 1997 episode of the sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;, in which that series&#x27; main character (Ellen DeGeneres) came out as gay.

From 1999 to 2000, she had a recurring role as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano in the first and second seasons of the NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

Fox has appeared in the films &quot;Velocity Trap&quot; and &quot;Food for the Heart&quot; and she also briefly appeared in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s cult film &quot;Memento&quot;, playing the main character&#x27;s wife in flashback footage.

===&quot;CSI&quot;===

In 2000, she gained a regular role on the CBS police procedural drama &quot;&quot; as Sara Sidle, a Las Vegas forensic scientist. She and her &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; co-star George Eads were fired from the show in 2004. Fox had allegedly failed to submit a letter to CBS confirming that she would be on time for shooting. The disputes were resolved in just over a week, and the two were rehired by CBS, but neither Fox or Eads&#x27; salary was raised, in spite of other cast members receiving raises. It was also reported that of the two, Fox was approached first to resume her contract with &quot;CSI&quot;, but she refused until Eads was rehired as well.

On April 18, 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot; began reporting that Fox might not be returning for the eighth season of &quot;CSI&quot;, having not yet signed a new contract. The seventh season finale turned out to be a cliffhanger involving her character, Sara Sidle. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Fox did not show up to film the finale because of ongoing issues over her employment. Neither CBS nor Fox&#x27;s agent confirmed the allegations.

In September 2007, after rumors emerged about Fox&#x27;s departure from the show, an online forum called &quot;Your Tax Dollars at Work&quot;, started a campaign to keep Sara Sidle on &quot;CSI&quot;; the campaign (called Dollars for Sense) includes mailing the show&#x27;s producers a dollar so as to keep Fox on the show. With the help of donations, the campaign also organized plane flyovers over the Universal Studios lot in California where &quot;CSI&quot; is filmed. The banners read &quot;Keep Jorja Fox on CBS&quot;. On October 15, 2007, Fox told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that she left &quot;CSI&quot;, saying that she wanted a break &quot;from the commitment of a weekly television series.&quot; Fox requested that the money collected during the &quot;Dollars for Sense&quot; campaign be donated to CASA, an organization dedicated to aiding foster children. On November 15, 2007, the episode &quot;Goodbye and Good Luck&quot; marked the character&#x27;s final regular appearance in an episode of &quot;CSI&quot; until the show entered its tenth season.

In May 2008, Fox returned for &quot;CSI&quot;&#x27;s ninth season as a guest star. After coming back for the first, second, and fifth episodes, she returned for William Petersen&#x27;s last episode as the star (&quot;One To Go&quot;) in the last scene, when Gil Grissom (Petersen) turns up in the jungle, surprising Sara, and in the episode finish wherein the two shared a passionate kiss.

In the summer of 2009, CBS announced that Fox would be returning to &quot;CSI&quot;. Fox was initially scheduled to appear in the tenth season premiere (&quot;Family Affair,&quot; which aired September 24, 2009) and four additional episodes. However, executive producer Carol Mendelsohn confirmed that Fox&#x27;s stay had been made &quot;more permanent&quot; and her role extended indefinitely. By July 2011, Fox was confirmed as a full-time, regular cast member again on &quot;CSI&quot; for the twelfth season, but she was added back to the opening credits for the eleventh season. She remained in the main cast until the show ended after the fifteenth season in September 2015.

===After &quot;CSI&quot;===
After leaving &quot;CSI&quot; in 2007, Fox produced the musical &quot;Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield&quot; starring Kirsten Holly Smith, about the tension between the public image and private life of bisexual musician Dusty Springfield, which played at the Renberg Theatre in the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center.

Fox guest-starred in the Lifetime sitcom &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;. The episode, which aired on August 16, 2009, had her playing a soccer mom with a criminal past. She also did a modeling shoot for Green With Glamour. Fox is the co-founder of Honeypot Productions, an independent avant-garde theatre company in Los Angeles that has produced five original plays. Her friend and HoneyPot co-founder Heather Reid wrote &quot;Dear Bernard&quot;, which Fox helped produce.

Fox is a musician; she plays guitar (badly, she says) and has a drum kit. She sings and writes songs, most notably the song &quot;Lullabye&quot; for the movie &quot;Traveling Companion&quot; as well as the song &quot;Satellite,&quot; which she published on her official web site. Fox and her &quot;CSI&quot; co-star Marg Helgenberger sang &quot;Stand by Me&quot; as a duet at the fourth annual benefit called &quot;What A Pair 4—A Celebration of Women&#x27;s Duets&quot; to benefit breast cancer research at the John Wayne Cancer Institute. It was held on June 11, 2006, at the Wiltern/LG Theatre.

==Activism and politics==
Fox is a supporter of the Human Rights Campaign and has been a dedicated vegetarian since the age of 19, working with PETA to help promote vegetarianism and also working with ADI to bring light to the suffering of animals in circuses. She has a purse named after her by the Montréal company &quot;Matt &amp; Nat&quot;, which designs vegan purses. Fox attended and read at the Los Angeles book launch of Karen Dawn&#x27;s &quot;Thanking the Monkey&quot;, and was seen on &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; discussing how being vegetarian helps the environment. In 2008, Fox volunteered her time to film a Public Service Announcement for the New York–based non-profit Orangutan Outreach, which supports Borneo Orangutan Survival and other projects aimed at ensuring the orangutan&#x27;s continued survival. The 30-second clip was shown on Animal Planet during the award-winning series &quot;Orangutan Island&quot;.

<text>Judiciary Square station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Red Line. It is located in the Judiciary Square neighborhood in the Northwest quadrant of the city, with entrances at 4th and D Street and 5th and F Street. It serves the many courthouses and municipal buildings in the area. The 5th and F Street entrance is located in the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which incorporates the escalators and elevators into its architecture.

==History==
Service began on March 27, 1976. This station is also the birthplace of the Metro, as the initial groundbreaking was held here on December 9, 1969.

During a September 2012 refurbishment of the station, new signage was installed. Similar signage can be found at the Gallery Place, NoMa–Gallaudet U, Morgan Boulevard, Grosvenor-Strathmore, and Largo Town Center stations. It is the only station with two-sided platforms with elevators between each platform and street.

From March 26 to June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the 2021 Inauguration.

== Station layout ==
The station has two tracks with two side platforms and a mezzanine on either end. Each mezzanine has fare gates and escalators reaching the street level. At the northwest end of the platforms, a pair of elevators directly serve the platforms, each with a single fare gate and ticket machine.

<text>Ryder System, Inc. is an American transportation and logistics company, specializing in truck rental and leasing, fleet management, supply chain management, and transportation management. It also offers full-service leasing, rental and maintenance, used vehicle sales, transportation management, professional drivers, e-commerce fulfillment, and last-mile delivery services. The company is headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, and operates in the United States and United Kingdom.

== History ==
Ryder was founded in Miami, Florida, in 1933 by James Ryder as a concrete hauling company with one truck, a 1931 Model &quot;A&quot; Ford. In 1938, Ryder signed a five-truck lease deal with Champagne Velvet Beer, increasing Ryder&#x27;s fleet to 20 trucks. By the following year, the fleet had more than 50 trucks. This led to Ryder changing its focus from distribution to leasing. Ryder bought Great Southern Trucking Company in 1952. In 1955, Ryder System, Inc. was formed to combine Great Southern and Ryder Truck Rental. Ryder System went public in 1955. In the 1960s and 1970s, Ryder expanded into distribution and supply chain. James Ryder retired in 1978.

A Ryder truck was used in the Oklahoma City Bombing on April 19, 1995. 

In 1996, Ryder decided to focus on commercial truck rental and leasing, and exited the &quot;one-way&quot; consumer truck rental business; which was purchased by equity firm Questor Partners Fund LP, who later sold it to Budget Truck Rental in June 1998.

In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Ryder for spending $960,000 on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008 to 2010, instead getting $46 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $627 million.

In 2017 Ryder launched electric truck rentals in California, and Chicago, Illinois. The trucks were equipped with 70 kWh batteries, which had an estimated range of 100 miles. Ryder is the exclusive maintenance provider for Workhorse&#x27;s electric fleet in North America, first launched in the San Francisco Bay area in 2018.

== Business ==
Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Transportation Solutions. As of December 31, 2019, the total company revenue was $8.93 billion, with profits before income taxes of $42.27 million. The number of full-time employees, as of December 2019 was 39,900 globally, with 38,600 in North America and 1,300 in Europe. The company employs approximately 9,500 drivers, 6,300 technicians and have approximately 25,600 hourly employees in the U.S.  About 4,300 of those are organized by labor unions.

=== Fleet management ===
Ryder&#x27;s fleet management business is its largest business segment, accounting for 61% of the company&#x27;s total revenue of $2.3 billion, or $1.4 billion for Q4 of 2019. This arm of the business does contract-based full-service leasing, contract maintenance, commercial rental and fleet support services. Under full-service leasing Ryder owns and maintains the trucks and the customer determines the destination. Commercial rentals are the white Ryder trucks which the contract customers can rent on a temporary basis. Ryder grew its North American rental fleet to nearly 30,000 vehicles in 2010 and 2011 raising the percentage of model year 2010 or newer vehicles in the fleet to more than 40 percent. Support services consist of insurance, vehicle permits, and fuel.

In April 2011 Ryder bought B.I.T. Leasing, from Hayward, California. Also in 2011 it acquired the full service leasing and rental business of Carmenita Leasing, Inc., located in Santa Fe Springs, California, and the full service lease, contract maintenance, commercial rental and dedicated contract carriage business, The Scully Companies, Inc., based in Fontana, California.

Launched in April 2018, the company operates a peer-to-peer truck-sharing platform, COOP, that allows owners of commercial vehicles to rent unused trucks and trailers to businesses. The program expanded to Florida in January 2019 and further expanded in Texas in February 2020. COOP by Ryder expanded fleet management services and bulk rentals nationwide in 2022.

As of December 31, 2019, Ryder owned or leased 213,800 vehicles. As of January 2020, they were the largest truck supplier in the US.

=== Supply chain ===
Ryder&#x27;s supply chain operations accounted for 28% of its revenue for a total of $649 million for Q4 2019. This business consists of management of a customer&#x27;s supply chain. Ryder managed over 50 million square feet (4,645,152 m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2019.

In December 2010 Ryder bought TLC, a supply chain services company based in Holland, Michigan.

=== Dedicated Transportation Solutions ===
Ryder Dedicated Transportation Solutions accounted for 15% of its revenue for a total of $346 million for Q4 2019. This arm of the business conducts both leasing and supply chain management. In 2013, Ryder launched a new name and identity for this program called Ryder Dedicated. The company expanded its Last Mile Delivery service for bulky and large goods to 11 markets in North America. In February 2019 Ryder launched a program for e-commerce that allows manufacturers to ship directly to consumers instead of using third-party shipping for small to large products. In May 2020 the company added food-grade capabilities to its e-commerce service.

== Acquisitions and partnerships ==
In 2008, Ryder acquired three regional competitors: Pollock NationaLease, Lily Transportation and Gator Leasing.

In April 2018, Ryder acquired Ohio-based MXD Group, an e-commerce fulfillment and last mile delivery provider with a network of 109 fulfillment centers across the United States and Canada. In May of that year, Ryder introduced RyderGyde™, a smartphone app for drivers and fleet managers to monitor and manage their fleets. In November 2018, the company ordered 1,000 electric trucks to add to their fleet. In May 2020 RyderShare was introduced as a collaborative logistics platform.

In January 2020 Ryder began a partnership with In-Charge Energy, Inc. and ABB, a provider of industrial automation and technology to provide electric vehicle charging to Ryder&#x27;s customers. In June 2020 Ryder began a partnership with Turvo, a provider of collaborative logistics software

In January 2022, Ryder completed the acquisition of Whiplash (formerly Port Logistics Group) for approximately $480 million in cash.

In October 2023, Ryder acquired Impact Fulfillment Services to add contract packaging and manufacturing capabilities.

In February 2024, Ryder acquired Cardinal Logistics, a North Carolina–based company.

== Locations ==
Previously Ryder had its headquarters in Doral, Florida. As of December 31, 2019, Ryder had 524 locations in 50 US States and Puerto Rico. This includes a Shared Services Center in Alpharetta, Georgia, that employs over 500 people and provides support to all FMS operations. Ryder opened a new logistics center in London, Ontario, Canada, in January 2018. The company announced the planned opening of two multi-client facilities in Perris, California and Fort Worth, Texas, while expanding an already existing Ryder warehouse in Douglassville, Pennsylvania. The three facilities were expected to be fully operational by May 2019. In May 2020 the company began to expand its e-commerce network with the opening of a new facility in Philadelphia and adding FDA approval for food-grade service to two other facilities in Perris, California and Dallas, Texas.

<doc id="560774" wikidata="Q513470" url="?curid=560774" title="Guano Islands Act">
<text>The Guano Islands Act (, enacted August 18, 1856, codified at §§ 1411-1419) is a United States federal law passed by the Congress that enables citizens of the United States to take possession of unclaimed islands containing guano deposits in the name of the United States. The islands can be located anywhere, so long as they are not occupied by citizens of another country and not within the jurisdiction of another government. It also empowers the president to use the military to protect such interests and establishes the criminal jurisdiction of the United States in these territories.

==Background==
In the 1840s, guano became a prized agricultural fertilizer and source of saltpeter for gunpowder. 

The U.S. began importing it in 1843 through New York. By the early 1850s, the U.K. imported over 200,000 tons a year, and U.S. imports totaled about 760,000 tons. The &quot;guano mania&quot; of the 1850s led to high prices in an oligopolistic market, government attempts to control prices, fear of resource exhaustion, and eventually the enactment of the &quot;Guano Islands Act of 1856&quot; in August 1856. The Act authorizes U.S. citizens to take possession of unclaimed islands containing guano for the U.S., empowers the President to protect such claims with military intervention, and establishes jurisdiction of criminal offenses under the laws of the United States within the territories, thus claimed. This encouraged American entrepreneurs to search for and exploit new deposits on tiny islands and reefs in the Caribbean and Pacific.

This was the beginning of the concept of insular area in U.S. territories. Up until this time, any territory acquired by the U.S. was considered to have become an integral part of the country unless changed by treaty and eventually to have the opportunity to become a state of the Union. With insular areas, land could be held by the federal government without the prospect of it ever becoming a state in the Union.

Under the Act, the U.S. gained control of around 94 islands. By 1903, 66 of these islands were recognized as territories of the U.S.

==Wording==
== Criminal jurisdiction ==
Section 6 provides that criminal acts on or adjacent to these territories &quot;shall be deemed committed on the high seas, on board a merchant ship or vessel belonging to the United States; and shall be punished according to the laws of the United States relating to such ships or vessels and offenses on the high seas&quot;. The provision was considered and ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Jones v. United States&quot;, .

==Result==
The Act continues to be part of the law of the United States. The most recent Guano Islands Act claim was made in 1997 to Navassa Island. However, the claim was denied because an American court ruled the island was already under American jurisdiction (a claim Haiti disputes).

==Claims==
While more than 100 islands have been claimed for the United States under the Guano Islands Act, all but ten have been withdrawn. The Act specifically allows the islands to be considered possessions of the U.S. The Act does not specify the territory&#x27;s status after private U.S. interests abandon it or the guano is exhausted, creating neither obligation nor prohibition of retaining possession.

, the islands still claimed by the United States under the Act are:
*Baker Island
*Howland Island
*Jarvis Island
*Johnston Atoll
*Kingman Reef/Danger Rock
*Midway Atoll
*Navassa Island (claimed by Haiti)
*Bajo Nuevo Bank (disputed with Colombia)
*Serranilla Bank (disputed with Colombia)
*Swains Island (part of American Samoa; no evidence that guano was mined. Claimed by Tokelau)

==Disputed claims==
A few islands claimed by the United States under the &quot;Guano Act of 1856&quot; are disputed. 

* Navassa Island — &quot;de facto&quot; US control. To cement the U.S. claim to Navassa Island against Haiti, President James Buchanan issued Executive Orders establishing United States territorial jurisdiction beyond just the Guano Act of 1856. The United States Supreme Court in 1890 ruled the Guano Act constitutional and, citing the actions of the Executive Branch, amongst other points in law, determined Navassa Island as pertaining to the United States. Control of Navassa Island was transferred by the Department of the Interior to the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs under Order No. 3205 on January 16, 1997. The Department of the Interior and Insular Affairs would later grant administration responsibilities to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under Order No. 3210 on December 3, 1999. Order No 3210 also established a territorial sea boundary for the United States around Navassa Island.

* Serranilla Bank and the Bajo Nuevo Bank. Serranilla Bank and the Bajo Nuevo Bank were ruled to be territory of Colombia by the International Court of Justice in 2001, against a claim by Nicaragua. The U.S. and Honduras have asserted claims. Colombia has granted fishing rights to Jamaica.

=== Private unrecognized claim ===

* In 1964, Leicester Hemingway, brother of author Ernest Hemingway, attempted to establish a country (or more appropriately, a micronation) dubbed the Republic of New Atlantis, on an bamboo raft anchored with an engine block outside the territorial waters of Jamaica, using the Guano Islands Act as part of a claim to sovereignty. His apparent intention was to use the new country as the headquarters for his own International Marine Research Society, with which he planned to further marine research and protect Jamaican fishing. Neither the U.S. nor Jamaica recognized his claim before the raft was destroyed in a storm in 1966.

<text>A memorial is an object or place which serves as a focus for the memory or the commemoration of something, usually an influential, deceased person or a historical, tragic event. Popular forms of memorials include landmark objects such as homes or other sites, or works of art such as sculptures, statues, fountains or parks. Larger memorials may be known as monuments.

==Types==
The most common type of memorial is the gravestone or the memorial plaque. Also common are war memorials commemorating those who have died in wars. Memorials in the form of a cross are called intending crosses.

Online memorials are often created on websites and social media to allow digital access as an alternative to physical memorials which may not be feasible or easily accessible.

When somebody has died, the family may request that a memorial gift (usually money) be given to a designated charity, or that a tree be planted in memory of the person. Those temporary or makeshift memorials are also called grassroots memorials.

Sometimes, when a student has died, the memorials are placed in the form of a scholarship, to be awarded to high-achieving students in future years.

Memorials to persons or events of major significance may be designated as &quot;national memorials&quot;.

<doc id="560782" wikidata="Q1718689" url="?curid=560782" title="Yerkes–Dodson law">
<text>The Yerkes–Dodson law is an empirical relationship between arousal and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson in 1908. The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases. The process is often illustrated graphically as a bell-shaped curve which increases and then decreases with higher levels of arousal. The original paper (a study of the Japanese house mouse, described as the &quot;dancing mouse&quot;) was only referenced ten times over the next half century, yet in four of the citing articles, these findings were described as a psychological &quot;law&quot;.

== Levels of arousal ==
Researchers have found that different tasks require different levels of arousal for optimal performance. For example, difficult or intellectually demanding tasks may require a lower level of arousal (to facilitate concentration), whereas tasks demanding stamina or persistence may be performed better with higher levels of arousal (to increase motivation). 

Because of task differences, the shape of the curve can be highly variable. For simple or well-learned tasks, the relationship is monotonic, and performance improves as arousal increases. For complex, unfamiliar, or difficult tasks, the relationship between arousal and performance reverses after a point, and performance thereafter declines as arousal increases.

The effect of task difficulty led to the hypothesis that the Yerkes–Dodson Law can be decomposed into two distinct factors as in a bathtub curve. The upward part of the inverted U can be thought of as the energizing effect of arousal. The downward part is caused by negative effects of arousal (or stress) on cognitive processes like attention (e.g., &quot;tunnel vision&quot;), memory, and problem-solving.

There has been research indicating that the correlation suggested by Yerkes and Dodson exists (such as that of Broadhurst (1959), Duffy (1957), and Anderson et al (1988)), but a cause of the correlation has not yet successfully been established (Anderson, Revelle, &amp; Lynch, 1989).

== Alternative models ==
Other theories and models of arousal do not affirm the Hebb or Yerkes-Dodson curve. The widely supported theory of optimal flow presents a less simplistic understanding of arousal and skill-level match. Reversal theory actively opposes the Yerkes-Dodson law by demonstrating how the psyche operates on the principle bistability rather than homeostasis.

==Relationship to glucocorticoids==
A 2007 review by Lupien at al of the effects of stress hormones (glucocorticoids, GC) and human cognition revealed that memory performance vs. circulating levels of glucocorticoids does manifest an upside-down U-shaped curve, and the authors noted the resemblance to the Yerkes–Dodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP) (the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high GC state).&lt;br&gt;
This review also revealed that in order for a situation to induce a stress response, it has to be interpreted as one or more of the following:
* novel
* unpredictable
* not controllable by the individual
* a social evaluative threat (negative social evaluation possibly leading to social rejection).

It has also been shown that elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal.

<text>(&quot;Rienzi, the last of the tribunes&quot;; WWV 49) is an 1842 opera by Richard Wagner in five acts, with the libretto written by the composer after Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s novel of the same name (1835). The title is commonly shortened to Rienzi. Written between July 1838 and November 1840, it was first performed at the Königliches Hoftheater Dresden, on 20 October 1842, and was the composer&#x27;s first success.

The opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzo (1313–1354), a late medieval Italian populist figure who succeeds in outwitting and then defeating the nobles and their followers and in raising the power of the people. Magnanimous at first, he is forced by events to crush the nobles&#x27; rebellion against the people&#x27;s power, but popular opinion changes and even the Church, which had urged him to assert himself, turns against him. In the end the populace burns the Capitol, in which Rienzi and a few adherents have made a last stand.

==Composition history==

&quot;Rienzi&quot; is Wagner&#x27;s third completed opera, and is mostly written in a grand opera style. In his 1860 essay &quot;Music of the Future,&quot; Wagner called it &quot;a work full of youthful fire&quot; which was inspired by &quot;the heroic opera of Spontini&quot; and the Parisian grand opera of Daniel Auber, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Fromental Halévy. &quot;Rienzi&quot;&#x27;s depictions of the mob, the liberal ethos associated with the hero and the political intervention of a reactionary clergy recall Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot; (1807), Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot; (1835), and Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (1836). Each act ends with an extended finale ensemble and is replete with solos, duets, trios and crowd scenes. There is also an extended ballet in act 2 according to the accepted Grand Opera format. Hans von Bülow was later to joke that &quot;&quot;Rienzi&quot; is Meyerbeer&#x27;s best opera&quot;. 

Wagner began to draft the opera in Riga in 1837, after reading Lytton&#x27;s novel (although John Deathridge has argued that Wagner&#x27;s work also bears the influence of Mary Russell Mitford&#x27;s 1828 &quot;highly successful English play&quot; &quot;Rienzi&quot;). During a 1839 visit to the bathing resort town of Boulogne, Wagner approached Meyerbeer with a partial draft of &quot;Rienzi&quot;, and the elder composer responded with encouragement. Meyerbeer also introduced Wagner to Ignaz Moscheles, who was also staying at Boulogne; as Ernest Newman comments, this was &quot;Wagner&#x27;s first meeting with real international musical celebrities&quot;. When the opera was completed in 1840, Wagner hoped for it to be premiered at the Berlin Royal Opera or the Paris Opéra.

Several circumstances, including his lack of influence, prevented this. Moreover, Wagner&#x27;s wife Minna, in a letter of 28 October 1840 to Wagner&#x27;s friend Apel, who had likely first made the suggestion that Wagner compose &quot;Rienzi&quot;, mentions a plan to perform the overture to &quot;Rienzi&quot; &quot;a fortnight hence&quot;, but contains a clear indication that her husband had just been committed to a debtors&#x27; prison. The full score of &quot;Rienzi&quot; was completed on 19 November 1840.

In 1841 Wagner moved to Meudon, just outside Paris, where the debt laws could be more easily evaded, whilst awaiting developments for &quot;Rienzi&quot;, having already written to King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, requesting that he order a production of the work in Dresden.
With the support of Meyerbeer, a staging of &quot;Rienzi&quot; was arranged in Dresden; Meyerbeer wrote to the Director of the Opera in Dresden, Baron von Lüttichau, that he found the opera &quot;rich in fantasy and of great dramatic effect&quot;. This, with the proposed staging of &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; in Berlin, also supported by Meyerbeer, persuaded Wagner to return to Germany in April 1842. During rehearsals the performers were highly enthusiastic; the tenor Tichatschek, in the title role, was so impressed with a passage from act 3 (later deleted because of the opera&#x27;s length), that &quot;at each rehearsal, each of the soloists contributed a silver groschen to [a] fund that Tichatschek had started ... No one suspected that what was an amiable joke for them was the means of buying [Wagner] an extra morsel of sorely-needed food.&quot;

The premiere of &quot;Rienzi&quot; took place on 20 October 1842 in the new Dresden Opera House, designed by the architect Gottfried Semper and opened the previous year. Semper and Wagner were later to become friends in Dresden, a connection which eventually led to Semper providing designs which became a basis of Wagner&#x27;s Festspielhaus in Bayreuth.

The first performance of &quot;Rienzi&quot; was well received in Dresden despite running over six hours (including intermissions). One legend is that, fearful of the audience departing, Wagner stopped the clock above the stage. In his later memoirs, &quot;Mein Leben&quot;, Wagner recalled:
No subsequent experience has given me feelings even remotely similar to those I had on this day of the first performance of &quot;Rienzi&quot;. The only too well-founded anxiety as to their success has so dominated my feelings at all subsequent first performances of my works that I could never really enjoy them or take much notice of the way the audience was behaving.[...] The initial success of &quot;Rienzi&quot; was no doubt assured beforehand. But the uproarious way in which the public declared its partiality for me was extraordinary ... The public had been forcibly predisposed to accept it, because everyone connected with the theatre had been spreading such favourable reports ... that the entire population was looking forward to what was heralded as a miracle ... In trying to recall my condition that evening, I can remember it only as possessing all the features of a dream.

Subsequently, Wagner experimented with giving the opera over two evenings (at the suggestion of von Lüttichau), and making cuts to enable a more reasonable performance in a single evening.

==Performance history==
Despite Wagner&#x27;s reservations, &quot;Rienzi&quot; remained one of his most successful operas until the early 20th century. In Dresden alone, it reached its 100th performance in 1873 and 200th in 1908 and it was regularly performed throughout the 19th century in major opera houses throughout Europe and beyond, including those in America and England in 1878/9. The Paris premiere of &quot;Rienzi&quot; finally took place on 6 April 1869 at the Théâtre Lyrique under the baton of Jules Pasdeloup. The US premiere took place on 4 March 1878 at the Academy of Music in New York and was followed on 27 January 1879 by the first UK performance at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London. The overture was the first work performed at the inaugural Henry Wood Promenade Concert at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London in August 1895.

A staging at the English National Opera in London, produced by Nicholas Hytner in 1983, placed the hero in the context of 20th-century totalitarianism. A production by David Pountney at the Vienna State Opera in 1999 set the work in the &quot;near future&quot;. Of this production Pountney wrote:
:Wagner invested the musical realization of &quot;Rienzi&quot; with the unashamed extravagance and tasteless exaggeration of a Las Vegas hotel ... only the self-consciously deliberate and unabashed use of kitsch could match this musical egomania.

Other contemporary productions have been rare. Performances were given at the Theater Bremen in April/May 2009 and at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and Oper Leipzig in April/May 2010. In July 2013, the bicentennial year of Wagner&#x27;s birth, performances of all three of Wagner&#x27;s early operas, including &quot;Rienzi&quot;, took place for the first time at Bayreuth, at the Oberfrankenhalle. This performance trimmed some parts, including the second-act ballet. The Boston premiere was produced in concert by Odyssey Opera in September 2013 as their inaugural performance. The Australian premiere was a concert performance by Melbourne Opera in December 2013, as part of the bicentennial celebrations.

== Roles ==

==Synopsis==
===Overture===

The opera opens with a substantial overture which begins with a trumpet call (which in act 3 we learn is the war call of the Colonna family) and features the melody of Rienzi&#x27;s prayer at the start of act 5, which became the opera&#x27;s best-known aria. The overture ends with a military march.

===Act 1===

&quot;Outside Rienzi&#x27;s house&quot;

The patrician Orsini and his cronies attempt to kidnap Rienzi&#x27;s sister Irene. Stefano Colonna, also a patrician but inclined to support Rienzi, prevents them. Raimondo appeals to the parties in the name of the Church to stop their fighting; Rienzi&#x27;s eventual appearance (marked by a dramatic key shift, from D to E flat) quells the riot. The Roman people support Rienzi&#x27;s condemnation of the nobles. Irene and Adriano realise their mutual attraction (duet &quot;Ja, eine Welt voll Leiden&quot; – Yes, a world of sorrows). A gathering crowd of plebeians, inspired by Rienzi&#x27;s speeches, offers Rienzi the crown; he demurs, insisting that he wishes only to be a Tribune of the Roman people.

===Act 2===
&quot;A hall in the Capitol&quot;

The patricians plot the death of Rienzi; Adriano is horrified when he learns of this. Rienzi greets a group of ambassadors for whom an entertainment is laid on (a lengthy ballet). Orsini attempts to stab Rienzi, who however is protected by a vest of chain mail. Adriano pleads with Rienzi for mercy to the nobles, which Rienzi grants.

The act 2 ballet is noteworthy as Wagner made a clear attempt to make it relevant to the action of the opera (whereas in most Grand Operas the ballet was simply an entertaining diversion). The &quot;Rienzi&quot; ballet was intended to tell the tale of the &#x27;Rape of Lucretia&#x27;. This storyline (in which Tarquinius, the last king of Rome, attempts to rape the virtuous Lucretia), parallels both the action of &quot;Rienzi&quot; (Orsini&#x27;s attempt on Irene) and its background (patricians versus the people). In its original form the ballet lasts for over half an hour – in modern performances and recordings it is generally drastically cut.

===Act 3===
&quot;The Roman Forum&quot;

The patricians have recruited an army to march on Rome. The people are alarmed. Adriano begs Rienzi to stop the war, offering his own life to avoid bloodshed, but is ignored. Rienzi rouses the people and leads them to victory over the nobles, in the course of which Adriano&#x27;s father Stefano is killed. Adriano swears revenge, but Rienzi dismisses him.

===Act 4===
&quot;Before the Lateran Church&quot;

Cecco and other citizens discuss the negotiations of the patricians with the Pope and with the Emperor of Germany. Adriano&#x27;s intention to kill Rienzi wavers when Rienzi arrives together with Irene. Raimondo now announces that the Pope has laid a papal ban on Rienzi, and that his associates risk excommunication. Despite Adriano&#x27;s urgings, Irene resolves to stay with Rienzi.

===Act 5===
&quot;Scene 1: A room in the Capitol&quot;

Rienzi in his prayer &quot;Allmächt&#x27;ger Vater&quot; (Almighty Father!) asserts his faith in the people of Rome. He suggests to Irene that she seek safety with Adriano, but she demurs. An apologetic Adriano enters and tells the pair that the Capitol is to be burnt and they are at risk.

&quot;Scene 2: The Capitol is ablaze&quot;

Rienzi&#x27;s attempts to speak are met with stones and insults from the fickle crowd. Adriano, in trying to rescue Rienzi and Irene, is killed with them as the building collapses.

In the original performances, Rienzi&#x27;s final words are bitter and pessimistic: &quot;May the town be accursed and destroyed! Disintegrate and wither, Rome! Your degenerate people wish it so.&quot; However, for the 1847 Berlin performance Wagner substituted a more upbeat rhetoric: &quot;Ever while the seven hills of Rome remain, ever while the eternal city stands, you will see Rienzi&#x27;s return!&quot;.

==Reception and performances==
&quot;Rienzi&quot; was an immediate success. This, his first real success of any kind, was crucial in Wagner&#x27;s career, launching him as a composer to be reckoned with. It was followed, within months, by his appointment as Kapellmeister at the Dresden Opera (February 1843), which also gave him considerable prestige. It also received critical acclaim elsewhere in Europe. The young Eduard Hanslick, later to be one of Wagner&#x27;s foremost critical adversaries, wrote in 1846 in Vienna:
I am of the firm opinion that [&quot;Rienzi&quot;] is the finest thing achieved in grand opera in the last twelve years, that it is the most significant dramatic creation since &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, and that it is just as epoch-making for its own time as were &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, each for its respective period of musical history.

Other critical comments through the ages have included (apart from von Bülow&#x27;s jibe about it being &#x27;Meyerbeer&#x27;s best opera&#x27;), &#x27;Meyerbeer&#x27;s worst opera&#x27; (Charles Rosen), &#x27;an attack of musical measles&#x27; (Ernest Newman) and &#x27; the greatest musical drama ever composed&#x27; (Gustav Mahler).

Franz Liszt wrote a &quot;Fantasy on Themes from &quot;Rienzi&quot;&quot; (S. 439) for piano in 1859.

Wagner later perceived &quot;Rienzi&quot; as an embarrassment; in his 1852 autobiographical essay, &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot;, he wrote &quot;I saw it only in the shape of &#x27;five acts&#x27;, with five brilliant &#x27;finales&#x27;, with hymns, processions and the musical clash of arms&quot;. Cosima Wagner recorded Wagner&#x27;s comment in her diary for 20 June 1871:

&quot;Rienzi&quot; is very repugnant to me, but they should at least recognize the fire in it; I was a music director and I wrote a grand opera; the fact that it was this same music director who gave them some hard nuts to crack – that&#x27;s what should astonish them.

Thus the work has remained outside today&#x27;s Wagner canon, and was only performed at the Bayreuth Festival in 2013, staged by Matthias von Stegmann. Although the composer disclaimed it, it can be noted that &quot;Rienzi&quot; prefigures themes (brother/sister relationships, social order and revolution) to which Wagner was often to return in his later works.

==&quot;Rienzi&quot; and Adolf Hitler==
August Kubizek, a boyhood friend of Adolf Hitler, claimed that Hitler was so influenced by seeing &quot;Rienzi&quot; as a young man in 1906 or 1907 that it triggered his political career, and that when Kubizek reminded Hitler, in 1939 at Bayreuth, of his exultant response to the opera Hitler had replied, &quot;At that hour it all began!&quot; Although Kubizek&#x27;s veracity has been seriously questioned, it is known that Hitler possessed the original manuscript of the opera, which he had requested and been given as a fiftieth birthday present in 1939. The manuscript was with Hitler in his bunker; it was either stolen, lost or destroyed by fire in the destruction of the bunker&#x27;s contents after Hitler&#x27;s death (the manuscript of Wagner&#x27;s earlier work &quot;Die Feen&quot; is believed to have met with the same fate). Thomas Grey comments:

In every step of Rienzi&#x27;s career – from ... acclamation as leader of the &quot;Volk&quot;, through military struggle, violent suppression of mutinous factions, betrayal and ... final immolation – Hitler would doubtless have found sustenance for his fantasies.

Albert Speer claims to have remembered an incident when Robert Ley advocated using a modern composition to open the Party Rallies in Nuremberg, but Hitler rejected this idea:

&quot;You know, Ley, it isn&#x27;t by chance that I have the Party Rallies open with the overture to &quot;Rienzi&quot;. It&#x27;s not just a musical question. At the age of twenty-four this man, an innkeeper&#x27;s son, persuaded the Roman people to drive out the corrupt Senate by reminding them of the magnificent past of the Roman Empire. Listening to this blessed music as a young man in the theater at Linz, I had the vision that I too must someday succeed in uniting the German Empire and making it great once more.&quot;

==Editions==
The original performance version of &quot;Rienzi&quot; was lost in the Dresden bombing of 1945, and the manuscript (on which it had been based) was lost in Berlin in 1945. No full copies had been made of either version, as far as is known. However, &quot;Rienzi&quot; was never established by the composer into a finalized version, so all performances of it since 1945 have been reconstructions.

A vocal score of the early 1840s, based on Wagner&#x27;s draft, remains as the only existing primary source. Two surviving full scores made in Dresden in the early 1840s (under Wagner&#x27;s supervision) already reflect the heavy cuts made in performances. The first printed score that was made under Wagner&#x27;s supervision in 1844 reflects even heavier cuts.

A critical edition of the opera was prepared by Schott&#x27;s in Mainz in 1976 as volume III of their scholarly complete edition of Wagner&#x27;s works. This edition was edited by Wagner scholars Reinhard Strohm and Egon Voss; it uses the extant sources but also contains the 1844 piano version prepared by Gustav Klink, (which includes some of the passages excised from early performances).

Overall it is not possible to accurately reconstruct Wagner&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; &quot;Rienzi&quot;, but &quot;Rienzi&quot; on the other hand was clearly never finished by the composer. It was constantly being altered during the 1840s (and, it seems, possibly throughout Wagner&#x27;s lifetime), so it is not feasible to fully determine Wagner&#x27;s exact or final intentions based on existing evidence.

==Recordings==

<text>The Dells of the Wisconsin River, also called the Wisconsin Dells (from Old English “”, modern English “dale”), meaning “valley”, is a 5-mile (8-km) gorge on the Wisconsin River in south-central Wisconsin, USA. It is noted for its scenery, in particular for its Cambrian sandstone rock formations and tributary canyons. The formations are divided into the &quot;Upper Dells&quot; and the &quot;Lower Dells&quot; by the Kilbourn Dam.

The cliffs, some over 100 feet (30 m) high, and side canyons are closed to the public to protect sensitive ecological features. The viewing of the rock formations by water is a tourist attraction in the area. The nearby city of Wisconsin Dells is the center of summer tourist activity, much of it in the form of the theme parks unrelated to the river features.

The Dells of the Wisconsin River is owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It was established as a State Natural Area in 1994.

==Description and formation==
The Dells was formed during the Last Glacial Period approximately 15,000 years ago, although the rock itself is much older, dating from the Cambrian Period approximately 510–520 million years ago when the area of Wisconsin was at the bottom of a shallow sea.

Approximately 19,000 years ago, the Dells was at the extreme western margin of the continental glacier. However, the Dells itself was never covered by glacial ice sheets – it was part of the large Driftless Area that was bypassed by the ice. The melting of the glacier formed Glacial Lake Wisconsin, a lake about the size of Great Salt Lake in Utah and as deep as 150 feet (45 m). The lake was held back by an ice dam of the remaining glacier. The eventual bursting of the ice dam unleashed a catastrophic flood, dropping the lake&#x27;s depth to 50 feet (15 m) and cutting deep, narrow gorges and unusual rock formations into the sandstone seen today.

==Ecosystem==
The area of the Dells provides a mixture of plant communities, including northern and southern oak, pine forests, as well as oak savanna, moist cliffs, and dry cliffs.

The cliffs provide unique niches for plants, some of which are very rare in Wisconsin, including:
*Cliff cudweed (&quot;Gnaphalium obtusifolium var saxicola&quot; ), which is known in only two places on Earth – in the Dells and in the Kickapoo Valley, grows on protected rock ledges.
*Lapland azalea (&quot;Rhododendron lapponicum&quot;)
*Round-stemmed false foxglove (&quot;Agalinis gattingeri&quot;)
*Maidenhair spleenwort (&quot;Asplenium trichomanes&quot;)
*Fragrant fern (&quot;Dryopteris fragrans&quot;).

Among the rare animals in the dell are six dragonfly species, including the Royal river cruiser (&quot;Macromia taeniolata&quot;), six rare mussels and numerous species of birds.

==Cultural history==
The cultural history of the area stretches back several thousand years, from early Paleo-Indian people to the more recent Native American peoples, such as Ho-Chunk, Sac, and Menominee, who left behind effigy and burial mounds, camps and village sites, garden beds, and rock art.

The Dells were made famous in 1886 by the photographer H. H. Bennett, who took the first stop-action photo of his son jumping onto Stand Rock.

The Kilbourn Dam, completed in 1909, raised the water level of the Upper Dells by about , flooding some of the caves and rock formations in Bennett&#x27;s photographs.

==Protected status==
The area is now owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and was designated a State Natural Area in 1994.

<text>Union Station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Red Line. The station is located in the Northeast quadrant of the city under the western end of Washington Union Station, the main train station for Washington. It has a single underground island platform. With a daily average of 9,848 tapped entries, Union Station is the third-busiest in the system, behind Metro Center and Foggy Bottom–GWU.

==Station layout==
Like the other original stations of the Metro, Union Station sports coffered vaults of concrete in its ceiling. One end of the station has a lowered &quot;box&quot; cut out of the ceiling. The station features an island platform with two exits, one mid-platform mezzanine leading to the main hall of Union Station and Massachusetts Avenue and the one northern exit leading to 1st Street NE and to the main boarding concourse. The station features escalators with the elevator between them as seen at Addison Road and North Bethesda between the mezzanine and platform.

==History==

After groundbreaking in 1969, the station opened as Union Station-Visitor Center (National Visitor Center) on March 27, 1976, with the rest of the Red Line. It was renamed to simply &quot;Union Station&quot; in 1982 following the closure of the National Visitor Center.

Union Station had dirtier walls than most stations as trains brought in soot from diesel engines in Union Station, resulting in a dimmer station. In March 2017, it was announced the station would be painted white at a cost of $75,000–$100,000. This sparked a debate amongst riders, as preservationists did not like the irrevocable act of painting the brutalist cavern, while other riders liked the brightened stations and cleaner feels that resulted from the white paint.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, the station was closed because of security concerns due to the 2020 Inauguration.

The street-level entrance on First Street, built into the existing retaining wall, was rebuilt to accessible-compliant standards, adding more space for extra fare gates and connections between the platform and track level. During initial construction of the station, a 600-foot (180-meter) pedestrian tunnel was constructed between the north mezzanine and H Street NE. However, prior to the station&#x27;s opening, the tunnel was boarded up and the space is now used by WMATA to store equipment. There have been plans to incorporate the abandoned tunnel into future station planned improvements.

<doc id="560805" wikidata="Q4505474" url="?curid=560805" title="NoMa–Gallaudet U station">
<text>NoMa–Gallaudet U station is an elevated, island platformed station on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority&#x27;s (WMATA) Metro system. It is located on the same embankment as the Amtrak tracks into Union Station. It serves the Red Line, and is situated between Union Station and Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood stations. With an average of 6,593 daily entries in 2023, NoMa–Gallaudet U was the ninth-busiest station in the Metro system and the busiest elevated stop.

NoMa–Gallaudet U is located near the intersection of New York Avenue and Florida Avenue in Northeast Washington, D.C. The station is within the NoMa neighborhood, which is both residential and commercial, and the station itself is in a commercial district on Florida Avenue. The station opened under the name New York Ave–Florida Ave–Gallaudet U on November 20, 2004, as both the system&#x27;s first infill station before Potomac Yard in 2023 and the first to be built with a mix of public and private funds. Additionally, a portion of the Metropolitan Branch Trail was completed as part of its construction.

==History==
The station was not originally built with the rest of the Red Line; the segment of the Red Line containing the site of this station opened in 1976. By 1996, however, the idea of a Metro station at New York Avenue was being proposed as part of greater improvements of New York Avenue between Downtown Washington at the Maryland state line. In February 1999, the major property owners in the vicinity of the proposed station agreed in principle to contribute approximately $25 million in private financing for the project. The money would be collected from all commercial property owners within radius of the proposed station by being charged special tax assessments. With an estimated cost of $84 million to complete in October 2000, the federal government approved $25 million for its construction. The remaining costs would be split with $34 million coming from the District and $25 million coming from special tax assessments for the surrounding commercial properties. With funding secured, physical construction could commence.

The groundbreaking for the station occurred on December 16, 2000, with Mayor Anthony A. Williams and D.C.&#x27;s Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton present for the festivities. In May 2002, Metro awarded a design–build contract to the joint venture of Lane Construction/Slattery/Skanska for the design and construction of the station. Since it was constructed along an existing line, its construction resulted in some delay for trains traveling on the Red Line during the construction of a double crossover switch. While still under construction in January 2004, the station name was changed from New York Ave to New York Ave–Florida Ave–Gallaudet U. The change was made to reflect its location near both Florida Avenue and Gallaudet University.

On November 20, 2004, the station opened as the 84th station, and first infill station, on the Metro system within 4 weeks prior to the opening of Morgan Boulevard and Downtown Largo stations. The final cost was $103.7 million with the federal government and private land owners each contributing $25 million and the D.C. government contributing $53.7 million. Its construction has catalyzed new development and redevelopment of the NoMa neighborhood. The station was renamed to NoMa–Gallaudet U on November 3, 2011, and formally christened with the new name on June 13, 2012.

===Future improvements===
There are plans to construct a pedestrian tunnel from the north entrance under the embankment to the east side of the tracks, and construction is scheduled to begin in 2028.

==Station layout==

NoMa–Gallaudet U is located near the intersection of New York Avenue and Florida Avenue in Northeast Washington. The station is within and named for the NoMa neighborhood, which is both residential and commercial. The station itself is in a commercial district on Florida Avenue. Its design differs from that of previous stations and is indicative of the lessons learned by Metro over its years of operation in several respects. Its canopy consists of white-painted, steel plate trusses and glass sheathing rather than concrete. Instead of having a single elevator as found at older stations, it contains two. This was done so if an elevator breaks down, service is provided to the station without having to offer shuttle service from another station.

The station also provides ten racks and 28 lockers for bicycle users, carsharing with Zipcar and connections to several Metrobus routes.

==Public art==
The station is notable for its artistic elements incorporated into its design as part of MetroArts, Metro&#x27;s Art in Transit Program.

===Journeys===
Created by sculptor Barbara Grygutis, The 2nd Street entrance contains a tall aluminum sculpture of a leaf from a scarlet oak. On each side of the sculpture is a poem entitled &quot;Journeys&quot; composed by Dolores Kendrick, Washington&#x27;s poet laureate. The poem reads: &quot;Go slowly in taking the steps, and fast when counting stars.&quot; Grygutis also created the steel fence outside the station studded with glass leaves of various hues. Its design was inspired by Washington&#x27;s dense tree canopy in addition to the scarlet oak being the official tree of the District.

<doc id="560806" wikidata="Q151867" url="?curid=560806" title="UEFA Euro 1988">
<text>The 1988 UEFA European Football Championship final tournament was held in West Germany from 10 to 25 June 1988. It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA. France were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. The tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time.

Euro 1988 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. This was the final European Championship to feature teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 countries in 1991.

==Bid process==
West Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England. Because the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA. In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games. As a compromise, the Berlin Olympic Stadium hosted a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.

==Overview==
===Group matches===
The first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.

The Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.

The Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy&#x27;s goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.

Spain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.

In the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.

The Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.

The second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B. In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.

England met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher&#x27;s replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.

The Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.

Needing to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.

===Semi-finals and final===
The first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition&#x27;s final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.

The other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union&#x27;s fourth appearance in a European Championship final.

The final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation&#x27;s last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten&#x27;s goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.

==Qualification==
===Qualified teams===
Seven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition. Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984). The following eight teams qualified for the final tournament:

==Venues==

<doc id="560807" wikidata="Q1400937" url="?curid=560807" title="Feedlot">
<text>A feedlot or feed yard is a type of animal feeding operation (AFO) which is used in intensive animal farming, notably beef cattle, but also swine, horses, sheep, turkeys, chickens or ducks, prior to slaughter. Large beef feedlots are called concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) in the United States and intensive livestock operations (ILOs) or confined feeding operations (CFO) in Canada. They may contain thousands of animals in an array of pens.

The basic purpose of the feedlot is to increase the amount of fat gained by each animal as quickly as possible; if animals are kept in confined quarters rather than being allowed to range freely over grassland, they will gain weight more quickly and efficiently with the added benefit of economies of scale. 

==Regulation==

Most feedlots require some type of governmental approval to operate, which generally consists of an agricultural site permit. Feedlots also would have an environmental plan in place to deal with the large amount of waste that is generated from the numerous livestock housed. The environmental farm plan is set in place to raise awareness about the environment and covers 23 different aspects around the farm that may affect the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency has authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate all animal feeding operations in the United States. This authority is delegated to individual states in some cases. In Canada, regulation of feedlots is shared between all levels of government. Certain provinces are required by law to have a nutrient management plan, which looks at everything the farm is going to feed to their animals, down to the minerals. New farms are required to complete and obtain a license under the livestock operations act, which looks at proper manure storage as well as proper distance away from other farms or dwellings. A mandatory RFID tag is required in every animal that passes through a Canadian feedlot, these are called CCIA tags (Canadian Cattle Identification Agency) which is controlled by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency CFIA. In Australia this role is handled by the National Feedlot Accreditation Scheme (NFAS).

==Scheduling==
The cattle industry works in sequence with one another, prior to entering a feedlot, young calves are born typically in the spring where they spend the summer with their mothers in a pasture or on rangeland. These producers are called cow-calf operations and are essential for feedlot operations to run. Once the young calves reach a weight between they are rounded up and either sold directly to feedlots, or sent to cattle auctions for feedlots to bid on them. Once transferred to a feedlot, they are housed and looked after for the next six to eight months where they are fed a total mixed ration to gain weight.

Feedlot diets encourage growth of muscle mass and the distribution of some fat (known as marbling in butchered meat). The marbling is desirable to consumers, as it contributes to flavour and tenderness. These animals may gain an additional 400-600 pounds (180 kg) during its approximate 200 days in the feedlot, depending on its entrance weight into the lot, and also how well the animal gains muscle. Once cattle are fattened up to their finished weight, the fed cattle are transported to a slaughterhouse.

==Diet==

Typically the total mixed ration (TMR) consist of forage, grains, minerals, and supplements to benefit the animals&#x27; health and to maximize feed efficiency. These rations are also known to contain various other forms of feed such as a specialized animal feed which consists of corn, corn byproducts (some of which is derived from ethanol and high fructose corn syrup production), milo, barley, and various grains. Some rations may also contain roughage such as corn stalks, straw, sorghum, or other hay, cottonseed meal, premixes which may contain but not limited to antibiotics, fermentation products, micro &amp; macro minerals and other essential ingredients that are purchased from mineral companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. 

Many feed companies are able to be prescribed a drug to be added into a farms feed if required by a vet. Farmers generally work with nutritionists who aid in the formulation of these rations to ensure their animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins, but also to make sure the animals are not wasting feed in their manure. In the American northwest and Canada, barley, low grade durum wheat, chick peas (garbanzo beans), oats and occasionally potatoes are used as feed.

In a typical feedlot, a cow&#x27;s diet is roughly 62% roughage, 31% grain, 5% supplements (minerals and vitamins), and 2% premix. High-grain diets lower the pH in the animals&#x27; rumen. Due to the stressors of these conditions, and due to some illnesses, it may be necessary to give the animals antibiotics on occasion.

==Animal health and welfare==
A feedlot is highly dependent on the health of its livestock, as disease can have a great impact on the animals, and controlling sickness can be difficult with numerous animals living together. Many feedlots will have an entrance protocol in which new animals entering the lot are given vaccines to protect them against potential sickness that may arise in the first few weeks in the feedlot. These entrance protocols are usually discussed and created with the farm&#x27;s veterinarian, as there are numerous factors that can impact the health of feedlot cattle. One challenging but crucial role on a feedlot is to identify any sick cattle, and treat them in order to rebound them back to health. Knowing when an animal is sick is sometimes difficult as cattle are prey animals and will try and hide their weakness from potential threats. A sick animal will generally look gaunt, may have a snotty nose and/or dry nose, and will have droopy ears, catching these symptoms early may be the key to successfully treating an animal. The best indicator of health is the body temperature of a cow, but this is not always possible when looking over many animals per day.

The diet of the animals and the different ingredients within the ration are controversial. Cattle in feedlots are fed grain rather than more natural forage. This is designed to make them gain weight faster, but it leads to internal abscesses and discomfort. Grain-based diets can also lead to the growth of harmful bacteria such as &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;. Too much grain in the diet can cause cattle to have issues such as bloating, diarrhea and digestive discomfort, which is why close monitoring of the animals, as well as working with ruminant nutritionists is very important for farmers.

Animal welfare is a major controversy towards farms today as consumers have shown their concern for the welfare of these animals. Indoor feedlots with concrete surfaces can cause leg problems including swollen joints. On outdoor feedlots, welfare issues include mud in rainy areas; heat stress in feedlots that are not shaded; insufficient water to drink; excessive cold, and problems with cattle handling (e.g. electric prods).

Water troughs shared among many cattle can increase the spread of diseases including bovine respiratory disease.

==Waste recycling==
There are a few common methods of waste recycling within feedlots, with the most common being spreading it back on the cropping fields used to feed the livestock. Generally, feedlots provide bedding for their animals such as straw, sawdust, wood shavings, or other byproducts from crops (soybean chaff, corn chaff), which are then mixed in with the manure as the livestock use the bedding. Once the bedding has outlasted its use, the manure is either spread directly on the fields or stock piled to breakdown and begin composting. A less common type of recycling in the feedlot industry is liquid manure which is where minimal bedding is found in the manure, so it stays a liquid and is then spread on the fields in a liquid form. Increasing numbers of cattle feedlots are utilizing out-wintering pads made of timber residue bedding in their operations. Nutrients are retained in the waste timber and livestock effluent and can be recycled within the farm system after use. Biogas plants are also able to use livestock manure to create biofuels, and these anaerobic digestion systems are known to capture methane in a usable form, while concentrating nitrogen, a valuable nutrient found in the manure which they then use to spread on their fields.

==History==
Cattle feeding on a large scale was first introduced in the early 60&#x27;s, when a demand for higher quality beef in large quantities emerged. Farmers started becoming familiar with the finishing of beef, but also showed interest in various other aspects associated with the feedlot such as soil health, crop management, and how to manage labour costs. From the early 60&#x27;s to the 90&#x27;s feeding beef cattle in the feedlot style showed immense growth, and even today the feedlot industry is constantly being upgraded with new knowledge and science as well as technology. In the early 20th century, feeder operations were separate from all other related operations and feedlots were non-existent. They appeared in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of hybrid grains and irrigation techniques; the ensuing larger grain crops led to abundant grain harvests. It was suddenly possible to feed large numbers of cattle in one location and so, to cut transportation costs, grain farms and feedlot locations merged. Cattle were no longer sent from all across the southern states to places like California, where large slaughter houses were located. In the 1980s, meat packers followed the path of feedlots and are now located close by to them as well.

==Marketing==

There are many methods used to sell cattle to meat packers. Spot, or cash, marketing is the traditional and most commonly used method. Prices are influenced by current supply &amp; demand and are determined by live weight or per head. Similar to this is forward contracting, in which prices are determined the same way but are not directly influenced by market demand fluctuations. Forward contracts determine the selling price between the two parties negotiating for a set amount of time. However, this method is the least used because it requires some knowledge of production costs and the willingness of both sides to take a risk in the futures market. Another method, formula pricing, is becoming the most popular process, as it more accurately represents the value of meat received by the packer. This requires trust between the packers and feedlots though, and is under criticism from the feedlots because the amount paid to the feedlots is determined by the packers’ assessment of the meat received. Finally, live- or carcass-weight based formula pricing is most common. Other types include grid pricing and boxed beef pricing. The most controversial marketing method stems from the vertical integration of packer-owned feedlots, which still represents less than 10% of all methods, but has been growing over the years. 

==Alternatives==

The alternative to feedlots is to allow cattle to graze on grass throughout their lives, but this is not efficient and can be very challenging. For Canada and the Northern USA, year round grazing is not possible due to the severe winter weather conditions. Controlled grazing methods of this sort necessitate higher beef prices and the cattle take longer to reach market weight.

<doc id="560810" wikidata="Q5566098" url="?curid=560810" title="Glacial Lake Wisconsin">
<text>Glacial Lake Wisconsin was a prehistoric proglacial lake that existed from approximately 18,000 to 14,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, in the central part of present-day Wisconsin in the United States.

==Formation and demise==
Before the last glacier, a somewhat different Wisconsin River drained the north-central part of the state, running around the east end of the Baraboo Hills. Around 18,000 years ago, the Green Bay lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet crept in from the east, abutting against the Baraboo Hills. With that outlet closed, the water backed up, filling the basin to the north and west, forming Glacial Lake Wisconsin.

The water rose to as deep as 160 feet, with a surface area eight times the size of modern Lake Winnebago, a large, cold lake that stretched north to the site of Wisconsin Rapids. Eventually it found a new outlet, flowing west to the Mississippi via the east fork of the Black River near City Point. With water flowing out again, the lake stopped rising.

Islands poked up out of this icy lake, some of which remain today as the sandstone bluffs of central Wisconsin - Mill Bluff and Roche-a-Cri, for example. The lake existed for thousands of years, with storms and ice scouring sand off those bluffs. Streams from the glacier to the north and east also carried in sand and silt which settled at the bottom of the lake, roughing in the flat sandy Central Plain that we see today when we follow I-90/94.

About 14,000 years ago, as the climate warmed, the glacier began to retreat. The lake water reopened the path around the Baraboo Hills. Once the trickle began, it quickly melted a larger channel through the ice and became a torrent. In a catastrophic flood, most of the huge lake probably drained out the south end in no more than a few weeks - possibly a few days. Upstream, the current cut new channels through the lake-bottom sand. After removing the lake-bottom sand, it cut canyons through the weak Cambrian sandstone beneath, which had existed long before the lake, forming the Dells of the Wisconsin River, that are now largely beneath the high water created by damming the river. Boat tours today show the portions that remain above water. 

This lake, during the last glacial period, was probably not the only Glacial Lake Wisconsin. The Wisconsin river travels from near the Upper Peninsula over 300 before until it meets the Mississippi at Prairie du Chien. Earlier glaciers probably blocked the Wisconsin River, producing earlier glacial lakes in central Wisconsin like Lake DuBay. After Lake DuBay, the Wisconsin river is blocked from going south for over twenty miles between Stevens Point and Wisconsin Rapids. A tall sandstone bluff is found on the south side of the river between these two cities. From Wisconsin Rapids to Nekoosa the river drops vertically 300 ft in just five miles and requires four dams. Rock outcroppings on the east side of the river at the Centralia dam, at the Bulls Eye Country Club and across the river from Port Edwards, suggest ancient flooding before the dams were built and the river reminds residents almost every year of its power to flood from the northern Wisconsin watershed. A large boulder just below the Nekoosa dam was obviously there in ancient times. Large Lake Petenwell above Necedah and Roche a Cri is now used to help control floods. Then after the Wisconsin Dells rock formations, 75-foot limestone bluffs carved by water exist as the Wisconsin merges with the Mississippi.

North East of Stevens Point, Sunset Lake, Three Lakes and numerous other unnamed glacial pothole-like lakes exist. With plentiful surface water more work is needed to understand buried rock formations and the hydrology of water feeding these lakes in central Wisconsin.

<text>The KXTV/KOVR Tower (also known as the Sacramento Joint Venture Tower) is a communications tower in Walnut Grove, California, United States.

Built in 2000, it is the tallest structure in California, second-tallest structure in the United States, third-tallest guyed mast in the world (as of 2001), and the eighth-tallest structure to have ever existed.

Omnidirectional antennas on the tower broadcast the over-the-air television (OTA) signal for KXTV-TV channel 10 (virtual and transmit) and KOVR-TV channel 13 (virtual) and 25 (transmit). The geographical coordinates for the site, a low-lying rural area about south-southwest of Sacramento and north-northwest of Stockton, are .

Th KXTV/KOVR Tower, the Channel 40 and KVIE-TV Channel 6 Tower, and the Channel 3-Hearst-Argyle Tower form an antenna farm on the east side of the Sacramento River and west of the Interstate 5 freeway which can be easily seen for miles around in every direction.

The towers provide OTA service to viewers in the Sacramento/Stockton/Modesto designated market area in California&#x27;s Central Valley.

With their significant height and central location in Walnut Grove, they provide line-of-sight (LOS) signal coverage to the adjacent flat valley terrain for over 60 miles (100 km) to the north (Sacramento) and to the south-southeast (Stockton and Modesto). The towers also provide coverage across the valley to the east into the Sierra Nevada foothills and mountains, and to the west to portions of the eastern San Francisco Bay Area (eastern Solano and Contra Costa counties).

The movie &quot;Fall&quot; was based on this radio tower, according to the director.

<doc id="560812" wikidata="Q7320900" url="?curid=560812" title="Rhode Island Avenue station">
<text>Rhode Island Avenue station (also known as Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood) is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Red Line. The station is located in the Brentwood neighborhood of Northeast, on an elevated platform crossing Rhode Island Avenue NE (U.S. Route 1)

==History==
The station was built on land formerly part of the African-American Columbian Harmony Cemetery. When the station was constructed in 1976, workers discovered that not all the bodies had been moved. At least five coffins were unearthed, and numerous bones. A plaque was affixed to a column near one of the station&#x27;s entrances to commemorate the former cemetery. When a parking lot at the site was renovated in 1979, more bones and bits of cloth and coffins were unearthed.

Service began on March 27, 1976, as one of the first stations in the system, opening as the eastern terminus of the Red Line. It was replaced as the eastern terminus by Silver Spring on February 6, 1978.

From the time the station opened on March 27, 1976, all the way up until November 20, 2004, the station was originally just named, &quot;Rhode Island Avenue&quot;. However; on November 20, 2004, during exactly the same time WMATA opened its brand new &quot;New York Avenue - Florida Avenue - Galludet University&quot; Metrorail Station in between the Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station &amp; Union Station, the &quot;Rhode Island Avenue&quot; Metro Station, was officially renamed, &quot;Rhode Island Avenue - Brentwood&quot; in recognition of the Brentwood neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C., which the station is located in. However; this particular name change of the Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station, was only initially reflected on WMATA&#x27;s Metrorail Rider Guides, System Maps, and on most of WMATA&#x27;s newer/updated Metrobus Schedules for each of the Metrobus Routes that served the Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station. The pylons and station signage, on the other hand, did not officially reflect the new name change of the station, until they were eventually replaced with brand new pylons and station signage during July/August, 2005.

In the summer of 2018 from July 21 to September 3, the station was shut down for platform repairs due to settling of the platform and decaying concrete caused by salty de-icer used in the winter.

===Future improvements===
In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platforms at the Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station would be rebuilt starting in September 2020.

==Station layout==
The station&#x27;s main entrance is located just south of Rhode Island Avenue on Washington Street N.E. The station&#x27;s island platform is stated to have the highest elevation of any Metro station in the system.

<doc id="560813" wikidata="Q7876201" url="?curid=560813" title="Civil libertarianism">
<text>Civil libertarianism is a strain of political thought that supports civil liberties and rights, or which emphasizes the supremacy of individual rights and personal freedoms over and against any kind of authority (such as a state, a corporation, social norms imposed through peer pressure and so on).

== In the libertarian movement ==
In the domain of libertarian philosophy, the primary concern of civil libertarians is the relationship between government and individuals. In theory, civil libertarians seek to restrict this relationship to an absolute minimum in which the state can function and provide basic services and securities without excessively interfering in the lives of its citizens. One key cause of civil libertarianism is upholding free speech. Specifically, civil libertarians oppose bans on hate speech and obscenity. Although they may or may not personally condone behaviors associated with these issues, civil libertarians hold that the advantages of unfettered public discourse outweigh any disadvantages, and that the coercion of speech is inherently wrong.

<doc id="560816" wikidata="Q610054" url="?curid=560816" title="Wang Dan (dissident)">
<text>Wang Dan (; born 26 February 1969) is a leader of the Chinese democracy movement and was one of the most visible student leaders in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He holds a PhD in history from Harvard University, and from August 2009 to February 2010, Wang taught cross-strait history at Taiwan&#x27;s National Chengchi University as a visiting scholar. He then taught at National Tsing Hua University until 2015.

Besides conducting research on related topics, Wang is an activist promoting democracy in China. Based in the United States, he travels the world to garner support from Overseas Chinese communities as well as from the public at large.

==Biography==
Wang Dan was born in 1969. He was a politically active student at the Peking University department of history, organizing &quot;Democracy Salons&quot; at his school. When he participated in the student movement that led to the 1989 protests, he joined the movement&#x27;s organizing body as the representative from Peking University. As a result, after the Tiananmen Square protests, he immediately became the &quot;most wanted&quot; on the list of 21 fugitives issued. Wang went into hiding but was arrested on 2 July the same year, and sentenced to four years imprisonment in 1991. After being released on parole in 1993, he continued to write publicly (to publications outside of mainland China) and was re-arrested in 1995 for conspiring to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party and was sentenced in 1996 to 11 years. However he was released early and exiled to the United States of America (see below).

Wang resumed his university studies, starting school at Harvard University in 1998 and completing his master&#x27;s in East Asian history in 2001 and a Ph.D. in 2008. He also performed research on the development of democracy in Taiwan at Oxford University in 2009. He is currently the chairman of the Chinese Constitutional Reform Association.

Wang was interviewed and appeared in the documentary &quot;The Beijing Crackdown&quot; and the movie &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot;, about the Tiananmen Square protests. He also featured prominently in Shen Tong&#x27;s book &quot;Almost a Revolution&quot;.

He was banned from setting foot on mainland China with his passport expiring in 2003. He attempted to visit Hong Kong in 2004, but was rejected. At that time, he was invited by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China to talk about politics ahead of the 15th anniversary of the June 4 crackdown. Due to a typhoon, Wang finally landed in Hong Kong for the first time in 2012, though he was confined to the airport&#x27;s restricted zone as he had no Hong Kong visa.

===Arrest and incarceration===
Following the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s crackdown on the protests, Wang was placed on a list of the 21 most wanted student leaders of the protests. Imprisoned on 2 July 1989, Wang spent nearly two years in custody before his trial in 1991. Wang was charged with spreading counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement. He was sentenced to 4 years in prison; a relatively mild sentence compared to other political prisoners in China at this time. This short sentence was thought to be caused by two things: the government was unsure of what to do with so many students, and felt pressure due to their high-profile nature. While incarcerated, Wang spent two years at Qincheng Prison, known for its high number of political prisoners. Despite the usual cramped conditions, because of his high-profile case, Wang was given his own cell.

Wang was released in 1993, just months before the end of his sentence. Wang Dan himself has noted this was most likely related to China’s first bid for the Olympic Games since he and 19 other political prisoners were released only a month before the International Olympic Committee was to visit. Almost immediately after his release in 1993 Wang began to promote democracy in China and contacted exiled political activists in the United States. He was arrested for a second time in May 1995, two months after an interview with the US based anti-communist periodical Beijing Spring. In this interview he states: &quot;We should clear a new path and devote ourselves to building a civil society by focusing our efforts on social movements, not political movements, self-consciously maintaining a distance from political power and political organs.&quot; Wang was held in custody for 17 months before receiving the charge of &quot;plotting to overthrow the government&quot;, and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

Instead of serving his entire sentence, he was released in 1998, ostensibly for &quot;medical reasons&quot; and was sent immediately to the US where he was examined in hospital, and quickly released to live in the United States as an exiled political activist. His release and move to the United States followed an agreement between the United States and China whereby the United States removed its support for a resolution criticizing China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and in return China released political prisoners such as Wang.

===Exile in the United States===
Not long after Wang arrived in the United States, he began to criticize the Chinese government once again. Wang believes the CCP must change its ways, and in an interview with the US magazine The Weekly Standard he states: &quot;The key to democracy in China is independence. My country needs independent intellectuals, independent economic actors, independent spirits.&quot; Wang received his PhD from Harvard University in 2008, and continues to be actively involved in fighting for change in China. Two of his works include: &quot;20 years after Tiananmen&quot; which takes a look at how economic change has affected the Chinese people, and contains suggestions for social and human rights changes. Wang also wrote &quot;Rebuild China with an Olympic Amnesty&quot; after his arrival in the United States; the document has a more positive outlook, as he felt international events such as the Olympic Games could shed light on human rights issues in China. In 2007, Wang&#x27;s second sentence expired, and he was officially &quot;released&quot;. The certificate for his release was issued to his parents on 2 October 2007.

===Activism and education work===
Wang has been productive in the years after his release from China. Wang has been able to publish articles such as &quot;Rebuild China with an Olympic Amnesty&quot; and &quot;20 years after Tiananmen&quot; as well as give public interviews. His exile in the United States allowed him to attend Harvard University to finish his education, obtaining a history degree. He also became chairman of the Chinese Constitutional Reform Association.

Wang taught PRC history at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan from 2010 to 2015. While he was teaching a class in November 2010, a woman carrying a knife entered the room, intending to stab Wang. He was able to remove the knife from the woman before she was able to stab him. He believes that &quot;this was the first time he faced what looked like an attempt on his life&quot;. The woman had allegedly been stalking Wang for three years.

According to a Chinese language article from Radio Free Asia, as of July 2009, Wang has a Facebook page that he hopes to use to communicate with people in mainland China.

Wang is a member of the WikiLeaks advisory board.

Wang sits on the Board of Trustees for the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation (CFHK).

=== Payments from Chen Shui-bian ===
In April 2011, news media reported that Wang testified in court that he had received two grants from the Chen Shui-bian administration totaling 400,000 USD and that the source of the money was not clear. Wang responded that the reports of him having received 400,000 USD are false.

Later, Wang said, &quot;The report [of the Central News Agency] is misleading. What we accepted is the Republic of China&#x27;s government&#x27;s funding of the overseas Democracy Movement. Well, if it is said to be Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s personal support, then I think this is not in line with the facts. [...] What he represents is not himself, but the government of the Republic of China.&quot;

In April 2022, Chen disclosed 21 cases of &quot;Guowu Jiyao Fei&quot;, including two payments to Wang Dan, totaling 6.6 million NTD.

Chen disclosed that Wang Dan was paid 200,000 USD after meeting him. Wang came to the Presidential Palace to talk to Chen. Chen also allocated 200,000 USD to be paid in two years to Wang. However, Chen said that U.S. law stipulates that it is not allowed to accept foreign government funding. In order to help Wang, the government used many people. Wang admitted this in a secret court, although receiving money from a foreign government is illegal in the United States.

=== Donation for brain tumor ===
In 2014, Wang Dan wrote on Facebook that he suspected having a brain tumor and requested the Taiwanese government to let him go to Taiwan.
Dissidents Tang Baiqiao and Feng Congde accused him of deceiving the public.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations ===
In 2023, a Taiwanese man named Lee Yuan-chun said in a social media post that Wang Dan had kissed and attempted to rape him in a hotel room in Flushing, New York in 2014, when Lee was 19 years old. He said he persuaded Wang to stop, but that Wang subjected him to lewd remarks in the following days. Lee subsequently filed a criminal complaint towards Wang alleging attempted rape, while Wang said Lee&#x27;s allegations were unfounded.

Nearly a year after the 2024 incident, Lee Yuan-chun received a &#x27;Non-Prosecution Notice&#x27; from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office and publicly shared partial screenshots of the notice on Facebook. The notice indicated that, based on Lee&#x27;s testimony, chat records of his confiding in others, and personal trauma-related posts he had made on Facebook around the anniversary of the June Fourth Incident each year, the prosecutors concluded that Wang Dan&#x27;s act of forceful kissing was established and constituted a suspected offense of forcible indecency. However, the prosecutors determined they lacked jurisdiction over non-Republic of China nationals accused of crimes committed abroad and therefore decided not to prosecute. Furthermore, the notice ruled that Wang Dan&#x27;s testimony and his witnesses&#x27; statements could not be admitted as evidence in his favor.

In response, Wang Dan issued a statement upon receiving the notice, claiming that he had received a &#x27;Non-Prosecution Notice&#x27; signed by the prosecutor citing &#x27;insufficient evidence&#x27; among other reasons.

The National Tsing Hua University where Wang worked until 2017 decided to launch an investigation in response, contacted his students from the past 13 years, and cancelled his lectures in the upcoming semester in the university&#x27;s school of sociology out of concern for his students. An investigative report by Deutsche Welle published in July 2023 mentioned further accusations against Wang regarding assault and sexual harassment.

===Zoom blocking===
An event hosted by Wang on Zoom in the United States was interrupted on 3 June 2020, with his Zoom account being blocked. This led to US lawmakers asking Zoom Video Communications to clarify their relationship with China regarding freedom of speech. Zoom apologized, explaining that the company was puzzled with requests from China regarding blocking, but they would not repeat the practice of blocking outside of China.

== Political positions ==

===Looking back at Tiananmen===
Wang Dan felt there were many things that could have been changed about the movement, and he has raised these issues, both during and after the movement. In an interview with The New York Times published 2 June 1989, Wang states, &quot;I think that the student movements in the future should be firmly based on something solid, such as the democratization of campus life or the realization of civil rights according to the Constitution,… Otherwise, the result is chaos.&quot; Another issue Wang raises is the involvement of intellectuals in the movement, expressed in the Times interview as well as a 2008 interview titled &quot;Tiananmen Remembered&quot;. In this source he believes that intellectuals were not used early enough in the movement, and their involvement may have changed the course of events. Despite pointing out failures, Wang feels the protests affected the mentality of many Chinese people, arguing the hunger strike was necessary as it allowed greater attention on the movement. In addition to this, Wang feels that the crackdown, and the promotion of democracy garnered the attention of the entire nation and educated people on democracy, which was a new idea for many Chinese people.

===Democracy===
Wang has stated that &quot;the pursuit of wealth is part of the impetus for democracy&quot;. He believed that the Tiananmen Square movement &quot;is not ready for worker participation because democracy must first be absorbed by the students and intellectuals before they can spread it to others&quot;.

===On China&#x27;s economic development===
At a press conference in Toronto on 31 May 2009, Wang commented on the so-called &quot;Beijing Doctrine&quot;: &quot;For the sake of economic improvement, everything can be done, even killing people ... [such a doctrine shows that] the Tiananmen Massacre is still going on, only in different ways: it was the students&#x27; lives being taken physically in 1989, but it is the mind of the world being poisoned spiritually today.&quot;
=== United States politics ===
Wang has claimed that the Black Lives Matter movement is a plot by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to prevent Donald Trump from winning the 2020 presidential elections and to disrupt US civil society. He has additionally said that the Democratic Party is &quot;weak&quot; on China. After Joe Biden won the 2020 elections, he said he wanted to hold-off recognizing Biden as president-elect and criticized the media for &quot;biased reporting&quot;. He also said about Biden:

<text>Casco Bay is an inlet of the Gulf of Maine on the coast of Maine in the United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s chart for Casco Bay marks the dividing line between the bay and the Gulf of Maine as running from Bald Head on Cape Small in Phippsburg west-southwest to Dyer Point in Cape Elizabeth. The city of Portland and the Port of Portland are on Casco Bay&#x27;s western edge.

==Name origin==
There are multiple theories about the origin of the name &quot;Casco Bay&quot;. &quot;Aucocisco&quot;, an Anglicisation of the Abenaki name for the bay, means &quot;place of herons&quot;, &quot;marshy place&quot;, or &quot;place of slimy mud&quot;. The explorer Estêvão Gomes mapped Maine&#x27;s coast in 1525 and named the bay &quot;Bahía de Cascos&quot;, translated as &quot;Bay of Helmets&quot;, based on its shape.

Colonel Wolfgang William Römer, an English military engineer, reported in 1700 that the bay had &quot;as many islands as there are days in the year&quot;, leading to the bay&#x27;s islands being called the Calendar Islands, based on the popular myth there are 365 of them. The &quot;United States Coast Pilot&quot; lists 136 islands; former Maine state historian Robert M. York said there are &quot;little more than two hundred&quot;.

==Geography, geology, topography and hydrography==
Casco Bay spans about 229 square miles, with its shore stretching 578 miles. In addition to Portland, Cape Elizabeth, and Phippsburg, municipalities with shorelines fronting Casco Bay include Brunswick, Cumberland, Falmouth, Freeport, Harpswell, South Portland, West Bath, Yarmouth, and the island municipalities of Chebeague Island and Long Island.

Researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey have dated volcanic material embedded in exposed bedrock in Casco Bay to the Ordovician period roughly 470 million years ago, predating the formation of the Atlantic Ocean by some 320 million years. The Norumbega Fault developed just inland from the Maine coast, with the geologic fault running roughly parallel to the coastline, including a portion of the northern shore of Casco Bay. The Flying Point Fault in Casco Bay is considered part of the Norumbega Fault system, dividing bedrock formations that have distinct geological characteristics.

Around 14,000 BCE during the Wisconsin glaciation period at the end of the last glacial cycle, the Laurentide ice sheet covering the Casco Bay region began to recede, according to radiocarbon dating on marine shells and other materials. The glacier&#x27;s retreat stripped bare underlying bedrock to form the rocky coast of Casco Bay&#x27;s shore and islands.

According to NOAA&#x27;s soundings, the bay&#x27;s deepest point is about 204 feet, southwest of Halfway Rock. A Phippsburg hill called Fuller Mountain has the bay&#x27;s highest elevation along the immediate shoreline, estimated at 269 feet above sea level by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1980, and 277 feet on more recent topographical maps. Sebascodegan Island has the highest elevation of any Casco Bay island at 201 feet on a hill called Long Reach Mountain, followed by Chebeague Island at 176 feet.

In Casco Bay&#x27;s western reaches, a line of islands extends west from Chebeague to Cushing Island to create protected anchorages for vessels, as do the narrow peninsulas that jut into the bay&#x27;s eastern section. A number of deep-water channels lead into the bay&#x27;s inner sections, including Cushing Island Reach, Hussey Sound, Luckse Sound, Broad Sound, and Merriconeag Sound

Casco Bay&#x27;s shoreline creates a number of smaller bays and tidal embayments, including Harpswell Sound, Maquoit Bay, Middle Bay, Quahog Bay and New Meadows River, where depths exceed 150 feet in a narrow channel just south of Cundy&#x27;s Harbor.

Casco Bay&#x27;s topography produces a tidal range of about nine feet on average. Seawater circulates counterclockwise into Casco Bay via the Gulf of Maine Gyre, which is formed from cold water that passes over the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, then in and out of the Bay of Fundy. In Casco Bay, tidal currents are stronger between island channels and weaker in smaller bays in the eastern section.

The Presumpscot River is the largest single source of non-saline water emptying directly into Casco Bay, flowing south from its headwaters at Sebago Lake, Maine&#x27;s second-largest lake. In addition to freshwater entering Casco Bay from the Presumpscot River and smaller streams along its length, lower-salinity seawater outside the mouth of the Kennebec River circulates west into Casco Bay.

== Ecology ==

Scientists have defined a distinct Casco Bay Coast Biophysical Region as part of the larger Northeastern Mixed Forest Province. The 2015 Maine Forest Inventory &amp; Analysis determined that the Casco Bay Coast Biophysical Region was 73 percent forested, with red maple the most widespread tree species in the region, followed by eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, northern red oak, red spruce and paper birch.

Water temperatures in Casco Bay rose by 3 degrees Fahrenheit over a three-decade period through 2022, with some scientists linking the change to shifting mixes of organisms and wildlife in the bay.

In a 2019 study of invasive species threatening Casco Bay eelgrass and kelp beds that other organisms and wildlife depend on, researchers found abundant evidence of the presence of several types of tunicates, bryozoa, Japanese skeleton shrimp and at one location European green crabs.

Casco Bay has an estimated 16,655 acres of intertidal habitats to include mudflats, marshes, beaches and rock formations according to the National Wetlands Inventory, supporting a range of biota and wildlife.

Among more than three dozen species of fish found commonly in Casco Bay are bluefin tuna, bluefish, cod, herring, mackerel, menhaden, sharks, smelt, striped bass, and winter flounder. Shellfish include lobsters, crabs, mussels, clams, oysters, scallops and periwinkles.

Harbor seal populations have been observed to number between 400 and 500 seals in Casco Bay. There have been a number of whale sightings in Casco Bay over the years, including the North Atlantic right whale and the humpback whale.

The number of water birds in Casco Bay varies by season and migratory cycles, with studies having shown anywhere from less than 5,000 to 32,000 or more across as many as 150 species, and significant nesting areas on 17 islands. Surveys of seabird populations in 1979 and 1980 identified nearly 5,400 nesting pairs of herring gulls across 56 colonies; close to 4,000 pairs of double-crested cormorants in 15 colonies; almost 3,000 pairs of eider ducks in 45 colonies; more than 2,100 pairs of great black-backed gulls in 37 colonies; and about 560 nesting pairs of common terns in nine colonies. Smaller numbers of horned grebes, common loons, ring-billed gulls, Bonaparte&#x27;s gulls and laughing gulls have been observed.
A 1975 survey determined that Upper Goose Island had the largest number of nesting great blue herons in Maine. Other wading birds in Casco Bay include snowy egrets, black-crowned night herons and the glossy ibis.

In addition to eider, other waterfowl in Casco Bay depending on seasons include Canada geese, snow geese, black ducks, goldeneyes, buffleheads, greater scaup, scoters, long-tailed ducks and harlequin ducks. Migratory shorebirds that pass through Casco Bay include sandpipers, plovers, turnstones, dowitchers and greater yellowlegs.

Raptor populations on Casco Bay islands and shorelines include osprey, with 86 nesting pairs observed in a 2011 survey, and 14 more nests that were deemed potentially active. After 30 years of monitoring produced no evidence of bald eagles in Casco Bay, a nesting pair was spotted in Freeport in 1992, followed by bald eagle pairs in Brunswick and Harpswell in 1994 and 1995. As of 2018, fifteen bald eagle pairs were observed in Casco Bay communities, nine of them in Harpswell.

==History==
===Native American population and arrival of European settlers ===
At the time of European contact in the 16th century, Abenaki peoples inhabited the region of present-day Casco Bay, including members of the Almouchiquois or Aucocisco group in the vicinity of the Presumpscot River.

Some Casco Bay islands have archaeological evidence of Native American visits and camps extending back 4,000 years, including shell middens and harpoon points.

It is uncertain whether early European explorers Giovanni da Verrazzano, John Cabot, Estêvão Gomes, or Bartholomew Gosnold entered Casco Bay. It is believed that Martin Pring made landfall in Casco Bay as part of a 1603 expedition, with Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua de Mons exploring it in 1605 from a base in Nova Scotia. In establishing the Popham Colony settlement near the mouth of the Kennebec River, George Popham landed in Casco Bay in 1607 while exploring the wider region. After Henry Hudson&#x27;s ship &quot;Half Moon&quot; was damaged in 1608 while attempting to discover a northwest passage to India, Hudson landed in Casco Bay for repairs.

In 1616, John Smith published a map of New England that included a depiction of Casco Bay based on his exploration of the region two years earlier.

Contact with Europeans exposed Wabanaki peoples to new diseases, with epidemics striking starting in 1616 that produced high mortality rates. By one estimate, just 5,500 of the 20,000 Wabanaki in Maine and part of present-day New Brunswick survived epidemics that broke out through 1619.

On August 10, 1622, King James I of England awarded a land patent to Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason for coastal lands and interiors extending from the Merrimack River to the Kennebec. Gorges and Mason eventually split the patent, with Gorges getting land patent rights north of the Piscataqua River.

The first colonial settlement in Casco Bay was that of Christopher Levett, an English explorer and agent of Gorges, who built a house on House Island in 1623–24. His initial settlement, called Machigonne and made up of veterans of the Wessagusset Colony on Massachusetts Bay, failed.

At the time, the sachem of the Almouchiquois along the Presumpscot was Scitterygusset, also known as Skitterygusset and other alternate spellings in historic records. Scitterygusset&#x27;s sister Warrabitta also had a leadership role.

In 1626, John Cousins established a homestead in Casco. In 1635, he moved several miles east to a waterway that became known as the Cousins River. Cousins Island and Littlejohn Island are also named for him.

Walter Bagnall settled in 1628 on Richmond Island, south of Cape Elizabeth and Casco Bay, and initiated trade with the Wabanaki. Bagnall was deemed an unscrupulous trader, and in 1631 Scitterygusset led a small band to the island to kill him and torch the island homestead.

In 1630, George Cleeve obtained a patent from the Council for New England on Richmond Island, and established a homestead there alongside his business partner Richard Tucker. After other British investors challenged the patent, Cleeve and Tucker relocated in 1633 to the mainland and began farming land on Casco Neck. Within four years, Cleeve and Tucker had obtained 1,500 acres of land on Casco Neck and established a fur-trading business.

In 1632, Gorges awarded Arthur Mackworth the island that became known as Mackworth Island, just off the mouth of the Presumpscot River, in what came to be called Casco, renamed Falmouth in 1658 under the governance of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Historic Falmouth was split into two municipalities in 1786, creating Portland.

In 1632, Thomas Purchase and George Way received a grant for Harpswell Neck, a few years after Purchase had established a farm, trading post, and fish salting operation on the Androscoggin River north of Casco Bay.

William Royall and his wife, Phoebe, moved in 1636 from Salem, Massachusetts, to present-day Yarmouth, building a homestead and farm along what came to be known as the Royal River. That year, George Jewell purchased the Casco Bay island that became known as Jewell Island.

In 1640, John Sears moved from Boston to live on Long Island. Little is known about Sears.

In 1642, Cleeve, Tucker, Mackworth, Royall and Smith were among 30 signers of a petition to the British House of Commons asking for relief from administrators assigned by Gorges to the region who were exercising &quot;unlawful and arbitrary power and jurisdiction over the persons and estate of your petitioners and the said other planters to their great oppression utter impoverishment and the hindrance of the plantation in these parts&quot;.

As settlers built out farms in the Casco Bay region, more commercial fishermen who were familiar with Casco Bay began making it their home port in the second half of the 1630s. Artisan craftsmen also moved to Casco and other towns on Casco Bay in the following decade, as a growing population supported commerce along with existing trade opportunities with indigenous peoples in the region. In 1659, George Munjoy moved to Casco and built a fortified house on today&#x27;s Munjoy Hill, which overlooks Casco Bay. In 1666, Munjoy acquired additional land along the Presumpscot River via a deed co-signed by Warrabitta.

Islands continued to come under individual settler ownership during the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1658, Hugh Moshier purchased what became Moshier and Little Moshier Islands near the mouths of the Harraseeket and Royal Rivers, while James Lane acquired nearby Lanes Island. By 1660, John Bustion had obtained a deed on today&#x27;s Bustins Island. Will Black Jr. relocated his family from Berwick in 1718 to the island that would become known as Will&#x27;s Island, and later Bailey Island after its acquisition by Timothy Bailey of Massachusetts.

===King Philip&#x27;s War===
Spurred by the Wampanoag chief Metacom in what came to be known as King Philip&#x27;s War, Native American warriors attacked colonial farms and settlements along the New England coast and inland areas beginning in June 1675, including in the Casco Bay region. If prodded into action by Metacom&#x27;s militant contemporaries drumming up support in northern New England, many local tribes followed their own counsel in planning attacks in the regional conflict that some historians dub the First Abenaki War, or chose not to initiate hostilities.

The first attack in the Casco Bay area occurred on September 10, 1675, at a farm north of Falmouth. Native American warriors killed six people and three more went missing. After another attack at Falmouth in October, heavy snow discouraged further action by either side for the rest of the year.

Despite concurrent peace talks by tribes to the east, in August 1676 Wabanaki Confederacy warriors raided several farms in Falmouth, killing or capturing 34 people. Settler Thaddeus Clark reported that survivors fled to Cushing Island, known at the time as Andrews Island for settler James Andrews. On Peaks Island that year, seven were killed in a Wabanaki attack after coming over from Cushing Island in search of food.

After colonial militia leader Richard Waldron laid a trap under the guise of peace talks to capture several Wabanaki warriors who were then executed or enslaved, tribes intensified attacks on settlements throughout Maine, causing most settlers to flee south. After talks failed at Maquoit Bay in February 1677, Waldron again ambushed Native Americans under the guise of parley.

In 1677, Gorges&#x27;s grandson sold his land rights in Maine to the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

As Wabanaki peoples got word of colonial authorities reaching out to leaders of the Mohawk people for assistance in Maine, they became more amenable to a truce, though significant attacks continued on Maine coastal settlements west of Casco Bay. Leaders of the Penobscot people signed the Treaty of Casco at Fort Loyal, in present-day Portland, on April 12, 1678, binding the Wabanaki Confederacy to ending King Philip&#x27;s War.

===French and Indian Wars===
====King William&#x27;s War====
After the Treaty of Casco, settlers began returning to Maine, in some instances setting up farms and homesteads near protective stockades as a fallback option in case of any renewed tensions. In 1700, a stockade that also served as a trading post was built in Falmouth east of the Presumpscot River and called New Casco, with two cairns built to commemorate friendship between the Abenaki people and settlers. The Brothers islands just off present-day Falmouth are thought to have been named for the cairns.

The 1678 treaty did little to address simmering disagreements and discord throughout the region between local tribes and settlers, laying the foundation for a renewal of hostilities in 1688. Historians came to consider the new conflict in Maine part of the larger King William&#x27;s War, which in turn marked the first installment of an extended proxy war between England and France that came to be known as the French and Indian Wars, with sporadic raids and atrocities on both sides.

In August 1688, in response to an English colonial raid of Penobscot Bay settlements, French officer Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie de Saint-Castin led counter-raids by Acadian militia and Wabanaki Confederacy warriors, including at Yarmouth. In September 1689, English colonial officer Benjamin Church arrived in Falmouth to defend settlers there, fending off a Wabanaki attack.

Louis de Buade de Frontenac, the Governor General of New France, launched a campaign to drive the English from the settlements east of Falmouth. On May 16, 1690, the fortified settlement on Casco Bay was attacked by a war party of 50 French-Canadian soldiers led by Castin, about 50 Abenaki warriors from Canada, a contingent of French militia led by Joseph-François Hertel de la Fresnière, and 300 to 400 additional natives from Maine, including some Penobscots under the leadership of Madockawando. Fort Loyal was attacked at the same time. About 75 men in the Casco settlement fought for four days before surrendering on May 20 on condition of safe passage. Instead, most of the men, including John Swarton, were killed, and the survivors, including Hannah Swarton and her children, were captured. Swarton was ransomed in 1695. Cotton Mather published her story.

Church returned to Casco Bay in September 1690 with a contingent of about 300 volunteer militia and indigenous warriors, launching attacks up the Androscoggin River and overseeing the brutal killings of Native Americans who had been left behind in a village, then pulling back to Cape Elizabeth. There, Church&#x27;s force beat off a Wabanaki attack in what was the last significant clash of King William&#x27;s War on Casco Bay.

A ferry service was established by 1690 in Portland Harbor connecting the northern and southern banks of the Fore River.

====Queen Anne&#x27;s War and Dummer&#x27;s War====
An uneasy armistice did not hold in North America or Europe, with Queen Anne&#x27;s War, which many historians classify as the second phase of the French and Indian Wars, breaking out in 1701. In 1722 came the regional conflict in Maine and Acadia called Dummer&#x27;s War, named for William Dummer, lieutenant governor of the province of Massachusetts Bay.

In Falmouth on June 20, 1703, Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley sought assurances from local Wabanaki chiefs that they would not initiate hostilities against English colonial settlers. The pact came to be known as the Treaty of Casco of 1703, which recognized the Kennebec River as the dividing line between New England and Acadia and New France to the east.

Fort George, on the Androscoggin River west of the Kennebec and about five miles north of Middle Bay, saw multiple fights during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. There was little fighting on Casco Bay, with one man killed in a Native American raid in May 1724 at Cape Elizabeth.

After initial treaties in 1725 and 1726, a larger ratification conference was held in August 1727 that came to be called the Treaty of Casco Bay, binding the two sides to terms for peace.

The town of Brunswick was incorporated in 1739.

====King George&#x27;s War====
Relations remained strained, with the Presumpscot River sachem Polin traveling to Boston in 1739 to lodge a protest with the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony over the damming of the river by settlers, which was threatening the fish supplies on which the Wabanaki peoples depended.

In the run-up to the outbreak of King George&#x27;s War in 1744, French privateers were operating from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia against New England fishing boats.

Under the leadership of Kittery shipping owner William Pepperrell, Massachusetts and other English colonies mustered a military expedition against the Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton. Pepperrell&#x27;s fleet commodore was Falmouth native Edward Tyng, who directed the siege and supporting operations from his flagship frigate &quot;Massachusetts&quot;.

===Pre-Revolution===
In 1751, the British Royal Navy assigned George Tate to Maine to oversee the harvesting of timber for ship masts, having previously focused its mast timber operations along the Piscataqua River basin. Tate built a house on a tributary of the Fore River estuary that today is the Tate House Museum. At the head of the Harraseeket River in Freeport, Mast Landing was likewise a loading point for pine timber reserved as masts for the Royal Navy. Mast timber was a sufficiently valuable commodity for the Royal Navy to provide timber cargo ships with armed escorts, and to send them back across the North Atlantic with empty holds to shorten the times for fresh shipments to arrive at British shipyards. Maine pines were marked with the &quot;broad arrow&quot; symbol to indicate that they were for harvest in service of the navy. Anyone else caught felling those trees was fined.

Tate also pursued other mercantile interests, selling timber, clapboards, rum, and other products, helping build the port as a growing center of commerce alongside merchants like Samuel Waldo, Jedidiah Preble, William Tyng, Enoch Freeman, Enoch Moody, and Thomas Westbrook, who began harvesting mast timber in 1727 and in partnership with Waldo dammed the Presumpscot River in 1735 for a sawmill and gristmill. In 1768, Falmouth exported more than four million feet of lumber and 150,000 wood staves for barrels to British ports, and between 1768 and 1772 shipped more mast timber than the largest ports in Nova Scotia, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania combined. West Indies ports were also major export destinations for wood products loaded at Falmouth, for use in construction and barrels. Imported products were sold in Falmouth stores and distributed throughout the Casco Bay region and inland.

The booming wood trade helped create cottage industries, with exports bringing in money to fund extensive construction, including churches, inns, assembly halls, and infrastructure, like bridges.

Harpswell was incorporated in 1758, followed by Cape Elizabeth in 1765.

Falmouth and other coastal towns were still outposts in an otherwise remote region, as John Adams wrote in an account of a 1765 trip through Maine, part of his legal circuit at the time as an attorney. Adams wrote, &quot;From Falmouth now Portland in Casco Bay, to Pownalborough there was an entire wilderness, except North Yarmouth, New Brunswick and Long Reach. At each of which places were a few Houses. In general it was a wilderness, encumbered with the greatest number of trees, of the largest size, the tallest height, I have ever seen.&quot;

===American Revolution===
According to Adams, he was strolling in 1774 on what he called &quot;the great hill&quot; of Munjoy Hill in Falmouth overlooking Casco Bay when he relayed to Jonathan Sewall his determination to lead the colonies into revolt against the British crown. &quot;The die was now cast; I had passed the Rubicon&quot;, Adams recollected conveying to Sewall. &quot;Swim or sink, live or die, survive or perish with my country, was my unalterable determination.”

Meeting in September and October 1774 in Philadelphia, the First Continental Congress issued a declaration of rights that included the formation of a Continental Association to coordinate a boycott of British goods starting in December.

On March 2, 1775, the Brunswick Continental Association leader Samuel Thompson invoked the boycott in attempting to block a ship from unloading rigging and other maritime supplies, with HMS &quot;Canceaux&quot; dispatched from Boston to Falmouth to provide protection. In the Thompson&#x27;s War standoff that played out for weeks and overlapped with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, militia captured Henry Mowat, commander of HMS &quot;Canceaux&quot;, with another officer on the ship threatening to shell Falmouth unless Mowat was released. HMS &quot;Canceaux&quot; sailed out of port in May 1775.

Mowat returned in October with a small squadron of ships and orders to bombard coastal Maine population centers, including Falmouth. After delivering an ultimatum for Falmouth denizens to surrender all arms and swear allegiance to King George III, he allowed time for residents to flee parts of the town within cannon range before opening fire. Hundreds of structures and several vessels were destroyed in the bombardment. The Burning of Falmouth stiffened the resolve of those in favor of revolt, and galvanized the Second Continental Congress to underwrite the creation of the Continental Navy.

The Royal Navy frigate HMS &quot;Cerberus&quot; arrived at Falmouth in early November, but left after residents continued construction of shore fortifications on Munjoy Hill. Massachusetts assigned General Joseph Frye to oversee fort construction, which extended in 1776 beyond Falmouth Neck to Spring Point on Cape Elizabeth, the future site of Fort Preble.

Falmouth was garrisoned for most of the remainder of the war as a precaution against any further British raids.

Casco Bay was home to several privateer ships and captains during the war, including the sloop &quot;Retrieve&quot;, commanded by Falmouth native Joshua Stone, which was captured in September 1776 by HMS &quot;Milford&quot; a month after receiving a privateer commission. Freed in a prisoner exchange, Stone went on to command the privateers &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; and &quot;Fox&quot;, with the latter vessel under the command of Falmouth&#x27;s Nathaniel Pote at another point. Other Falmouth residents or natives who commanded privateers included James Dilworth on &quot;Blackfish&quot;, Philip Crandall on &quot;Roebuck&quot;, and Henry Butler Elwell and Reuben Gage on &quot;Union&quot;. Harpswell resident Isaac Snow had a stint as commander of &quot;America&quot;.

In April 1778, the French frigate &quot;La Sensible&quot; arrived in Casco Bay with a communique of France&#x27;s commitment to a treaty that would result in extensive military and logistics support for the Continental Army, including naval power to hamper British movements.

In 1777, five years after surveyor Samuel Holland produced a detailed chart of the Maine coast from Casco Bay to the Kennebec River, cartographer Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres (spelled Des Barres in some historic references), at the request of the British Admiralty, published &quot;Atlantic Neptune&quot;, a chart book of the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland to New York. Rudimentary maps existed previously, including one produced by Cyprian Southack in 1720 that included information on tidal currents, based on a voyage to Casco Bay in 1698. The Holland charts detail Casco Bay&#x27;s islands, channels, shallows, and rivers, many of them carrying historic names no longer in use. The chart labeled as Portland Point the southwesternmost point of Casco Bay, and used Portland Sound to describe the westernmost channel leading to the inner harbor. A chart of Falmouth Harbor DesBarres published in 1781 lists Holland as chief surveyor and has greater detail, including mapped details of the shoreline, including hills, roadways, and the locations of structures on the mainland and islands.

On September 3, 1783, the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the American Revolutionary War, a &quot;Committee of the Sufferers in Falmouth, Casco Bay&quot; wrote Benjamin Franklin to ask him to use his diplomatic connections to raise funds to assist in the reconstruction of Falmouth.

&quot;It comes from Men who have suffered exceedingly, not only by the common Calamities of War, but by an extraordinary Event peculiarly awful and distressing&quot;, wrote five committee signatories in reference to the Burning of Falmouth.

===Federalist era===
In 1786, Falmouth was separated into two municipalities, with the historic name kept for the municipality formed east of the Presumpscot River called New Casco, and Portland adopted as the new name for Falmouth Neck and inland. In 1789, Freeport was created from land that had previously been part of North Yarmouth.

In 1787 George Washington approved the construction of a lighthouse near the tip of Cape Elizabeth, which with a Congressional outlay was completed in 1791 and named Portland Head Light.

In July 1789, in its first two major legislative acts, Congress enacted the Tariff Act and Duties on Tonnage Act to establish a revenue stream and provide preferential tariffs for imports carried on U.S.-flagged ships, while mandating that coastal trade be limited to U.S. vessels. Intended to bolster the development of U.S. shipyards and a domestic merchant marine, the Duties on Tonnage Act did so: registered U.S. ship tonnage rose from 123,893 tons of vessels in 1789 to 848,307 tons in 1807.

A third law enacted at the end of the month established customs stations for the collection of duties, including one in Portland covering overseas trade there and in Falmouth, and approving North Yarmouth and Brunswick &quot;as ports of delivery only&quot; after ships paid duties on cargoes in Portland or Falmouth.

Historic records show at least four schooners were built at Falmouth between 1790 and 1800 and three schooners, four sloops, and a brig on the Royal River in Yarmouth. Shipbuilding accelerated in Casco Bay in the 19th century with the establishment of several major shipyards.

In 1796, Tukey&#x27;s Bridge opened as a toll bridge, connecting the opposite points at the head of Portland&#x27;s Back Cove.

The U.S. Census Bureau ranked Portland the 27th-largest municipality in the U.S. as of 1800, with a population of 3,704.

===Jeffersonian era===
====Jefferson administration====
In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson asked to meet with retired naval captain Edward Preble of Portland, and the next year Preble was made commodore of the Mediterranean Squadron assigned to neutralize privateers operating out of Tripoli. He made the his flagship and oversaw a blockade and multiple assaults on Tripoli to contain the Barbary pirates threat.

On the domestic front, Jefferson supported the idea of coastal forts and small gunboats less than 80 feet long to defend ports and coastal shipping lanes, as an alternative to appropriating funds for a larger, blue-water navy. Three forts along Portland Harbor were built or upgraded during Jefferson&#x27;s second term: Fort Preble on Spring Point in Cape Elizabeth, named for the late commodore; Fort Scammel (Scammell in many historic accounts) on House Island; and Fort Sumner on Munjoy Hill.

Organized by Lemuel Moody, the Portland Observatory was completed in 1807 on Munjoy Hill as a signal tower to communicate with ships as they approached the harbor, allowing merchants to give wharf longshoremen advance word on ships nearing port. Moody devised a system of flags to signal ships&#x27; identities, with the observatory also used to better spot weather fronts approaching the bay.

====War of 1812====
After years of British harassment of U.S. vessels, including the impressment of sailors, President James Madison signed a declaration of war on Great Britain on June 18, 1812.

Portland became the home port for at least nine privateers operating against British merchant shipping, including the 16-gun brig &quot;True-Blooded Yankee&quot;, which conducted several raids along the coasts of Ireland and Scotland before being captured. The Freeport-built &quot;Dash&quot; was credited with eight prizes and &quot;Dart&quot; with five. After the defeated the HMS &quot;Boxer&quot; off Pemaquid Point, U.S. sailors brought the two ships to Portland Harbor and the slain commanders were buried side by side in the city&#x27;s Eastern Cemetery.

British forces in Halifax launched no major campaigns in Casco Bay during the War of 1812, seizing territory in eastern Maine instead.

The war prompted a fresh review of coastal fortifications by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which eventually resulted in the construction of Fort Gorges on Hog Island Ledge in Portland Harbor.

===Maine statehood===
An existing movement for Maine statehood gained adherents after the Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812, amid disenchantment with a lack of support from Massachusetts leaders during the British occupation of eastern Maine.

In June 1819, the Massachusetts General Court passed legislation making Maine an independent district from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with just over 70% of voters in both Cumberland County and Maine voting in favor of statehood. On March 15, 1820, Maine became the 23rd state as part of the Missouri Compromise approved by Congress and James Madison, with Portland designated the temporary capital until a permanent site could be determined.

In 1821, Cumberland seceded from North Yarmouth, with Chebeague becoming part of Cumberland. Throughout the 19th century, Chebeague was a center for the construction of sturdy, gaff-rigged stone sloops designed to handle cargoes of granite, which came into demand nationally for the construction of public buildings and other structures. At the height of demand during the century, 33 quarries along Casco Bay employed between 10,000 and 15,000 quarrymen, cutters, and apprentices.

In 1822, a bridge was built to connect the Falmouth Neck and Cape Elizabeth banks of the Fore River.

In 1825, Lemuel Moody published an updated chart of Casco Bay based on the DesBarres chart, with an inset of Portland Harbor noting newer names of some locales and detailing shallows throughout the bay.
In 1827, construction was completed of a stone tower on Little Mark Island at the mouth of Merriconeag Sound to serve as a navigational beacon for ships. The tower included a room at its base to house survivors of shipwrecks until they could be rescued.

According to a ship&#x27;s list published in November 1828, 15 ships were then based in Portland Harbor.

A pair of stone rubble lighthouses were built that year at the site of today&#x27;s Two Lights station, at the southwestern entrance to Casco Bay in Cape Elizabeth. The same year, a bridge was built across the mouth of the Presumpscot River connecting Martin&#x27;s Point in Portland with Falmouth.

In 1828, excavation began on the Cumberland and Oxford Canal. It took two years to complete, creating a navigable waterway from Sebago Lake to Casco Bay. The canal followed the course of the Presumpscot River from Sebago Lake south to Westbrook with locks allowing vessels to negotiate changes in elevation. From there, the canal course cut across to the east bank of the Fore River estuary and into Portland.

The Maine State Legislature declared Augusta the state capital in 1831, with work completed the following year on the original structure of the Maine State House on the west bank of the Kennebec River.

After wharves and buildings in Portland Harbor were destroyed in a November 1831 nor&#x27;easter, planning began for a breakwater to protect the harbor. Construction began in 1836, and the breakwater initially extended 1,800 feet. In 1855, a small wooden lighthouse was built at the site of today&#x27;s Portland Breakwater Light.

In 1835, the state of Maine incurred expenses surveying a potential Brunswick and Casco Bay Railroad. In 1842, Maine&#x27;s first railway was established with the initiation of service on the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad connecting Portland to South Berwick. In 1847, a rail yard was established on Turner&#x27;s Island in the Fore River estuary, followed by what came to be called the Butler Shipyard.

In 1848, four years after John A. Poor proposed it, the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad began service between Portland and Yarmouth (originally known as the Atlantic and St. Lawrence), with the line eventually extended to Montreal. The Grand Trunk Railway acquired the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad in 1853 as part of the Canadian company&#x27;s expansion into New England. At Poor&#x27;s urging, a small rail line was laid along the Fore River to link the new railroad to the wharves of Portland Harbor along the new Commercial Street.

West Bath was separated from Bath in 1844, with a portion of Sebascodegan Island within its borders as the case for Harpswell and Phippsburg. Yarmouth became independent from North Yarmouth in 1849.

In 1859, construction was completed on the U.S. Marine Hospital at Martin&#x27;s Point at the mouth of the Presumpscot River, to provide medical care for merchant seamen as part of the Marine Hospital Service.

=== Civil War ===

In 1857, Congress approved funding for the construction of Fort Gorges on Hog Island Ledge in Portland Harbor, with the original plan for a fort there conceived after the War of 1812 to provide artillery support against naval attacks for Fort Scammel and Fort Preble. Similar in appearance to Fort Sumter but designed with six sides, Fort Gorges was built of granite starting in 1858. Construction was completed by the end of the American Civil War, but advances in weaponry had rendered the fort obsolete by then.

In June 1863, Confederate Navy raider Charles Read led a boarding party to seize the U.S. revenue cutter &quot;Caleb Cushing&quot; in Portland Harbor, with the intent to destroy other vessels in the harbor and escape to sea. Abandoning his plan to attack shipping, Read steered the &quot;Caleb Cushing&quot; out to sea, with two Union steamers running down the ship, which Read scuttled before being captured.

In February 1864, the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company&#x27;s bark-rigged steamship &quot;Bohemian&quot; struck Alden&#x27;s Rock off Cape Elizabeth en route to Portland, with 219 passengers aboard, mostly Irish immigrants, and 99 crew members. As water flooded the ship, the captain was able to maintain steam for the time required to clear the ledge and steer the ship within half a mile of the Cape Elizabeth shore. There, seawater extinguished boiler fires and the crew dropped anchor and deployed lifeboats. Forty-two people perished in the efforts to reach shore.

===Harbor development and industrialization===

====Great Fire of 1866====

As of 1866, Portland had about three dozen commercial wharves on Commercial Street and several more on the opposite bank of Portland Harbor in Cape Elizabeth. On July 4 that year, a fire was sparked on a wharf that jumped to nearby buildings and, fanned by strong winds, tore northeast to Munjoy Hill. Photographers captured the destruction. Two people died in the inferno and about 10,000 were left homeless, with the destruction of 1,200 residential structures and about 600 commercial buildings. A tent city was established near the Portland Observatory and donations poured in from New England, Canadian provinces, and other states. Reconstruction proceeded quickly in the next few years, with brick and granite chosen to reduce risk of future fires and the Italianate and Second Empire styles dominating the new architecture. In 1869, a water storage reservoir was built on Bramhall Hill.

Organizers formed the Portland Water Company in 1862, to seek the construction of a municipal water system connected to Sebago Lake. Water service commenced on Thanksgiving Day 1869.

After the Great Fire of 1866 destroyed the building that housed offices of the U.S. Customs Service, Congress authorized construction of a new U.S. Custom House on Fore Street near the Portland waterfront. Construction began in 1867 and was completed in 1872. The U.S. Custom House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

====Industrialization and infrastructure====

Samuel D. Warren purchased a Westbrook paper mill in 1854 and later began adding wood fiber to paper produced at S.D. Warren Paper Mill, as a supplement to rag pulp used for paper production at the time. By the 1880s, S.D. Warren had become the world&#x27;s largest paper mill. The plant discharged wastewater and pulp used in the production process into the Presumpscot River, in time becoming the largest single source of industrial pollution in the Casco Bay watershed.

In 1865, the Russell Ship Ceiling Co. shipyard was established on the bank of Portland&#x27;s Eastern Promenade, as shipbuilding accelerated on the shores of Casco Bay.

On September 8, 1869, coastal Maine incurred severe damage in a hurricane, which caused 30 shipwrecks along the coast, including the schooner &quot;Helen Eliza&quot;, which went aground off Peaks Island, with just one of the vessel&#x27;s crew of 12 surviving.
After multiple shipwrecks over the preceding decades on shoals at Halfway Rock, in 1869 Congress earmarked funds for construction of a lighthouse there. Work began that year with a temporary shelter erected for workers, given the site&#x27;s distance from the mainland at the outer edge of Casco Bay. The lighthouse was built primarily from granite quarried on Chebeague Island and hewn into shape on House Island. On August 15, 1871, Halfway Rock Lighthouse began service, with a foghorn added in 1887.

In 1873, the United States Fish Commission undertook an extensive study of fish stocks and habitats in Casco Bay, with survey staff establishing a base of operation and a laboratory on Peaks Island and publishing its findings in 1874. In addition to cataloging fish species, the survey included water temperatures on the surface and bottom, and described the seabed at several locations in the bay.

In 1875, the original Portland Breakwater lighthouse was replaced by a cast-iron lighthouse, known colloquially as Bug Light.

After decades of individual ferry service in Portland Harbor and to outlying islands, including by the Peaks Island Steamboat Company, successor firm Casco Bay Steamboat Company was incorporated in 1878 to provide regular scheduled service, followed in 1881 by the Harpswell Steamboat Company. The companies merged in 1910 to form Casco Bay Lines. In 1885, the People&#x27;s Ferry Company was founded to provide service in Portland Harbor, with service extending to Peaks Island.

Dockworkers formed the Portland Longshoremans Benevolent Society labor union in 1880, with membership peaking within two decades at 868.

In 1881, Robert Peary purchased an island off Harpswell Neck called Sawungun and renamed it Eagle Island, before enlisting in the U.S. Navy and undertaking a series of expeditions to explore territories north of the Arctic Circle. Peary used nearby Upper Flag Island as a place to keep his arctic sled dogs, and later purchased Crab Island.

The Consolidated Electric Light Company of Maine established three steam-powered generators to produce electricity in the Portland area starting in 1883. In 1912, it merged with the Portland Electric Company to form the Cumberland County Power and Light Company.

With scheduled ferry service to Peaks Island, the Greenwood Gardens amusement district took shape on the island in the 1880s. It eventually included a boardwalk, inns, eateries, a dance hall, a Ferris wheel, a bowling alley, an observation tower, a roller skating rink, and the 1,500-seat Gem Theatre.

In January 1891, the coal schooner &quot;Ada Barker&quot; went aground on Junk of Pork near Outer Green Island. The crew clambered onto the rock along the collapsed foremast, with minutes to spare before the waves smashed the escape route and the larger ship. The crew survived on the rock until the U.S. revenue cutter &quot;Levi Woodbury&quot; rescued them after hours of exposure to the storm.

In 1892, Portland established a quarantine station on House Island for newly arrived immigrants to reduce the threat of epidemics in the city. The federal government absorbed the immigration and quarantine station in 1907 and ran it for three decades. Some called the island the &quot;Ellis Island of the North&quot;.

In 1897, construction was completed on Spring Point Ledge Light in Portland Harbor. The next year, South Portland was created as a municipality independent of Cape Elizabeth. The municipality of Deering was split off from Westbrook in 1871, and Portland absorbed Deering in 1899.

The Portland and Yarmouth Electric Railway was established in 1898, four years after its charter by Maine&#x27;s state legislature, and eventually ran service between the municipalities on a half-hour schedule and underwrote the construction of the Underwood Spring Park casino resort in Falmouth to spur ridership. The Portland and Brunswick Street Railway launched trolley service in 1902, connecting Yarmouth and Brunswick with a stop at the Casco Castle resort in South Freeport on the Harraseeket River overlooking Casco Bay. Electric trolley service was also extended south of Portland via the Portland and Cape Elizabeth Electric Railway, with stops at the Willard Beach Casino in South Portland and subsequently the Cape Cottage Casino in Cape Elizabeth.

At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the U.S. Navy dispatched the Civil War–era USS Montauk to guard Portland Harbor. Construction began that year on Fort Levett on Cushing Island and was nearing completion at Fort Williams in Cape Elizabeth, where multiple gun batteries were installed.

With preparatory work having already started on Fort McKinley on Great Diamond Island, construction proceeded on the fort during the Spanish-American War. Fort McKinley eventually became Casco Bay&#x27;s largest military installation. On adjacent Cow Island, Fort Lyon was constructed in 1901 for auxiliary support. Both forts had facilities to support harbor defensive mining operations, and guns to engage enemy minesweepers in Hussey Sound.

Lightship LV 74 was launched in 1902 as the last wooden lightship built for the U.S. Coast Guard. The vessel was named &quot;Cape Elizabeth&quot; and stationed off the coast there, and renamed &quot;Portland&quot; in 1912. After a series of groundings, construction began in 1903 on Ram Island Ledge Light in Portland Harbor. The lighthouse was completed in 1905.

In 1911, Maine&#x27;s legislature authorized the formation of the Island Light &amp; Water Co. to provide electricity, gas, and water service on Cushing, Great Diamond, and Little Diamond islands.

In 1912, Maine Governor Frederick W. Plaisted approved the eviction of residents of Malaga Island, just off Phippsburg, after years of gossip and negative news articles about the island&#x27;s population which was racially diverse and living on subsistence income. In 2023, Malaga Island was added to the National Register of Historic Places, becoming the second island in Casco Bay to be listed in its entirety after Eagle Island.

With Long Island among Casco Bay&#x27;s leisure destinations in the early 20th century, a June 1914 fire destroyed much of the island&#x27;s business district, including the waterfront Granite Springs Hotel.

The Million Dollar Bridge was completed in 1916 over the Fore River between Portland and South Portland, with the bascule bridge replacing the existing span that dated to 1822.

===World War I===
When World War I broke out in Europe in 1914 and German U-boats began attacking shipping in the Atlantic, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916, which set in motion major investments in U.S. ship construction and coastal defense.

In March 1917, John Poor died of a gunshot wound sustained during an exchange of fire while he was on nighttime sentry duty at Fort Williams. He had challenged two men who had infiltrated the base where Poor was assigned as a private to the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps. Poor is thought to have been the first U.S. soldier to die in the line of duty during World War I, before the U.S. declared war on Germany. It was the first of multiple such incidents in the Portland area that spring. The &quot;Lewiston Evening Journal&quot; reported that &quot;suspicious characters have been observed at all the fortifications in the Portland district.&quot;

Under the initial command of Major General Clarence Edwards, the Army&#x27;s Northeastern Department garrisoned coastal artillery batteries at existing forts on the Casco Bay shore and islands. Fort Williams was the headquarters of the coastal defenses for the Portland district overseeing Forts Levett, Lyon, McKinley, and Preble in Casco Bay, along with Fort Baldwin and Fort Popham in Phippsburg. Fort Scammel on House Island was classified as an inactive station, and land on Peaks Island, Long Island, and Crow Island adjacent to Great Diamond was listed as reservations for military needs. A wireless telegraphy station was established at Fort Levett on Cushing Island, and Fort Gorges became a depot for the storage of mines and munitions. In April, the War Department authorized a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program at Bowdoin College in Brunswick.

Multiple Casco Bay shipyards built wooden Ferris-type ships for North Atlantic cargo duties, including Cumberland Shipbuilding in South Portland, the Portland Ship Ceiling Co., successor company Russell Shipbuilding, and Freeport Shipbuilding on the Harraseeket River.

With leisure spending dropping sharply during the war years, the Casco Bay and Harpswell Lines could not generate enough revenue to keep up with needed repairs for its ferries, and, facing liens on debt, declared bankruptcy in July 1919. Edward B. Winslow purchased the company and reorganized Casco Bay Lines to resume service the next spring, initially with a fleet of four ferries.

===Roaring Twenties and Great Depression===
Two years after creating a state harbor commission, in 1919 Maine&#x27;s legislature authorized a $1.15 million bond issue to finance construction of a new wharf facility in Portland, in recognition of advancements in cargo handling at competing New England and Canadian ports. Initially designed with a length of 1,000 feet and the harbor bottom dredged 35 feet deep, the Maine State Pier was completed in 1923.

In 1921, the Great Chebeague Golf Club opened for play on the northern end of Chebeague Island with a nine-hole layout, and every hole having a view of Casco Bay. The course was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

The Peaks Island Corporation was formed to provide electricity and water service on Peaks Island, initiating service in 1922 and five years later renamed the Casco Bay Light &amp; Water Company.

In December 1925, while moored in Portland Harbor, the six-masted schooner &quot;Edward J. Lawrence&quot; caught fire. A fireboat crew could not extinguish the blaze, and the ship sank in flames as thousands of onlookers watched from the Eastern Prom and elsewhere. The ship was moved north of Fort Gorges, where it sank.

Organizers staged the inaugural Peaks to Portland Swim in August 1927, with Portland resident Wendell Willworth winning the 2.4 mile harbor race with a time of two hours and 33 minutes.

Construction began that year on the Bailey Island Bridge. It opened in 1928, spanning Will&#x27;s Gut to Orr&#x27;s Island, after studies on designs to minimize the granite span&#x27;s impact on tidal currents and to withstand the effects of ice. Thought to be the only such design in the United States, the Bailey Island Bridge was named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1984, one of three Casco Bay structures on the list, along with Portland Head Light and the Portland Observatory.

With organizers drawing inspiration from the offshore Newport Bermuda Race, the Portland Yacht Club held the inaugural Monhegan Island Race in 1928, with five local yachts entered in the regatta along with a sixth that was cruising in the area. Saracen crossed the finish line third behind the Universal P-class yachts Sayonara II and Nahma, but with rules in place that precluded P-class boats from qualifying for the trophy, Saracen was named the winner.

In 1931, Stroudwater Airport commenced service with a Boston &amp; Maine Airways flight after expanding an existing private airfield along the Fore River in Portland. As part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs to rebuild the U.S. economy during the Great Depression, the Maine Emergency Relief Administration added two runways in 1934 and 1935, and the airport was renamed the Portland-Westbrook Municipal Airport. MERA also built a civilian airfield in Brunswick.

In 1938, the competition that came to be known as the Bailey Island Fishing Tournament held its first event for anglers of bluefin tuna.

The Gem Theater burned down on Peaks Island in 1934, and two years later a group of buildings at the island&#x27;s Forest City Landing were destroyed by fire.

For the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Portland artist Victor Kahill was commissioned to design a sculpture to commemorate the Maine fishing industry. He produced a plaster mold for The Maine Lobsterman, with three statues cast from the mold on display at Land&#x27;s End on Bailey&#x27;s Island, in downtown Portland, and in Washington, D.C.

===World War II===
On September 3, 1939, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, commencing the Battle of the Atlantic. Two days letter, Roosevelt declared U.S. neutrality in the conflict, with a Neutrality Patrol established to monitor for any activities of belligerent vessels in U.S. territorial waters.

With Canadian oil supplies disrupted by the threat of German U-boats, construction commenced on the Portland-Montreal pipeline, which had its main southern terminal in South Portland on the Fore River.

Since Casco Bay was the nearest American anchorage to the Atlantic Lend-Lease convoy routes to Britain until the U.S. entered World War II, Admiral Ernest J. King ordered a large pool of destroyers to be stationed there for convoy escort duty in August 1941. On December 11, 1941, the United States and Germany declared a state of war, four days after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor. On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, battleships , and were in Casco Bay.

In the months leading up to the war declaration and afterward, U.S. Army Brigadier General Robert C. Garrett was commander of the Harbor Defenses of Portland based at Fort Williams in Cape Elizabeth. In May 1941, the Harbor Defense Headquarters Battery was formed to oversee the 8th Coast Artillery and the 240th Coast Artillery regiment of the Maine Army National Guard.

To detect enemy submarines and prevent them from entering Casco Bay&#x27;s anchorages, the U.S. Navy installed indicator loop cables along the seabed that were designed to produce a recordable amount of voltage when a submarine passed above, though the system was prone to glitches and occasional erroneous recordings. An outer indicator loop ran from the southern tip of Staples Cove in Cape Elizabeth northeast to a point just east of Halfway Rock, then north to Land&#x27;s End on Bailey Island. A second indicator loop was installed closer to the island channels to the anchorages of Portland Harbor and Falmouth, running northeast from Fort Williams to a point west of Peaks Island, then north to Long Island. Hydrophones were installed along portions of the inner indicator loop. In June 1942, the system detected the possible entrance of a U-boat into the eastern section of Casco Bay.

Minefields blocked the channels to Portland Harbor including between Cape Elizabeth and Cushing Island and Ram Island Ledge, and northeast from there to Outer Green Island. Anti-submarine nets were also placed in Whitehead Passage between Cushing and Peaks; in Hussey Sound between Peaks and Long Island; and in channels between Long Island and Chebeague Island; Chebeague and Littlejohn Island; and Cousins Island and Yarmouth.

In 1942, construction began on Battery Steele, where a pair of 16-inch Mark 2 guns were emplaced, matching the caliber on battleships of the day. The Battery Steele guns could fire projectiles 26 miles, giving them the range to cover all of Casco Bay and as far south as Kennebunk. Peaks Island was also the site of Battery Craven, whose six-inch guns had a range of about 15 miles, while Battery Foote guns at Fort Levett on Cushing Island could cover an arc extending from the Saco River to the outlying sections of Harpswell.

Towers for fire control, observation, or radar were built on the shores of outlying islands, including Long, Peaks, Cushing, Jewell, and Bailey Islands, to scan the horizon for aircraft or ships and help coastal artillery crews at Battery Steele and other artillery posts triangulate on targets approaching Casco Bay. Fire control towers were also built on the mainland, including in Cape Elizabeth just south of Dyer Point, at Trundy Point, and on the opposite end of the bay at Small Point in Phippsburg.

Under U.S. Coast Guard and Navy regulations, maps were distributed to show commercial and leisure boat operators sections of the bay that were off limits, and the lanes boats could traverse. Vessel operators had to pass through a U.S. Coast Guard control point before continuing through gates in the submarine netting to waters outside the control zone. Passengers had to carry identification cards, and cameras were forbidden.

In June 1941, the 44-foot cabin cruiser &quot;Don&quot; departed Harpswell for a clambake on Monhegan Island with at least 34 people aboard. The boat never returned amid hazy weather and fog later in the day, with contacts on Monhegan Island reporting &quot;Don&quot; never arrived. No one survived the excursion, and no conclusive evidence surfaced of what befell &quot;Don&quot; and its passengers.

The Navy established a fuel annex on Long Island with lengthy piers to fuel naval and cargo ships.
On March 26, 1942, U.S. Navy Task Force 39 became the first to sortie from Casco Bay, for Scapa Flow in Scotland to support convoy operations. Task force ships included aircraft carrier , battleship , heavy cruisers and , and four destroyers.

In April 1943, the Brunswick airfield built with New Deal funding was commissioned as Naval Air Station Brunswick, as a maritime reconnaissance base and training field for Royal Canadian Air Force and British Royal Navy pilots.

A Naval Auxiliary Air Facility was also established on Long Island to support seaplanes launched by catapult from larger warships, for use in reconnaissance and to direct naval gun fire at long ranges.

In addition to convoy preparation, Casco Bay was used for naval training and shakedown cruises to assess newly built or refurbished vessels. After Italy&#x27;s armistice in September 1943, three Italian U-boats were assigned to Casco Bay for destroyer training exercises in U-boat detection and engagement.

In 1940, the Todd-Bath Iron Shipbuilding Corporation was established in South Portland as an affiliate of Todd-Bath Shipyards of New York, after the British Purchasing Commission awarded a contract for the construction of 30 ocean-class cargo ships for war service. Todd-Bath Iron Shipbuilding set up seven ways to build and launch ships. The next year, a second shipyard, South Portland Shipbuilding, added four more ways for ship construction. In 1943, the two companies merged into a single entity, the New England Shipbuilding Corporation. At its peak during the war years, New England Shipbuilding employed 30,000 workers.

New England Shipbuilding was one of 18 major shipyards that received contracts to build American-designed Liberty-class cargo and transport ships for transatlantic duty.

In 1943, former Maine Governor Percival P. Baxter donated Mackworth Island to the state, which designated the island a state park in 1946.

On April 23, 1945, several miles off Cape Elizabeth, became the next-to-last U.S. Navy warship sunk during World War II, after a torpedo attack by the German U-boat &quot;U-853&quot;. Forty-nine crew members died in the attack, with 13 rescued. The destroyer dropped depth charges after a sonar contact, but &quot;U-853&quot; was able to evade the attack.

On May 8, the day after Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender to Allied forces, U-boat &quot;U-805&quot; became the first German U-boat to send a signal of its commander&#x27;s intent to surrender. A boarding party from a U.S. destroyer-escort instructed the commander to steer &quot;U-805&quot; to Casco Bay, with the surrender effected on May 15.

In October 1946, New England Shipbuilding launched the last of the 266 Liberty ships it built in South Portland, more than a year after the surrender of Japan ended World War II.

Records show that 770 ships passed through Casco Bay between January 1941 and January 1947, with as many as 140 more possibly having done so.

===Modern era===
After World War II ended, returning service personnel produced a housing boom and economic expansion.

In March 1947, the loaded coal steamer &quot;Oakley L. Alexander&quot; went aground off Cape Elizabeth. The captain later reported that an 80-foot rogue wave hit the vessel and broke off a large section of its bow. Hundreds of people gathered on shore to watch the rescue effort, including schoolchildren who were bussed to the shore. A U.S. Coast Guardsman launched a line to the stricken ship with a Lyle gun, and all 32 crew members came ashore with the assistance of a life preserver on the line, as waves crashed over them at intervals along the way.

A Gulf Oil tanker went aground off Bailey&#x27;s Island in December 1953. The captain pumped at least 3,000 gallons of gasoline into Casco Bay to lighten the ship in an effort to free it from the ledge. It was the first recorded instance of a fuel spill in Casco Bay at the time of a 1973 Research Institute of the Gulf of Maine study commissioned by the state of Maine, with the study tracking 336 oil and fuel spills in Portland&#x27;s vicinity.

Another Fore River bridge opened in 1954 connecting Portland and South Portland, west of the Million Dollar Bridge.

Ten days after Hurricane Carol caused damage in coastal areas in Maine in 1954, Hurricane Edna hit on September 11, causing massive damage as torrential rains unleashed floods that destroyed some bridges and washed away railroad tracks.

In 1955, construction was completed on the Ellis C. Snodgrass Memorial Bridge connecting Cousins Island to Yarmouth. The bridge gave construction vehicles access to the island to build the Wyman Station power plant on the island&#x27;s western tip to generate electricity for Central Maine Power.

The Portland School for The Deaf relocated to Mackworth Island in 1957, with a vehicular causeway connecting the island to the mainland in Falmouth. The school was renamed the Maine School for the Deaf, then the Governor Baxter School for the Deaf.

The federal government sold the former Cape Elizabeth Military Reservation to the state of Maine. The state opened the 41-acre Two Lights State Park at the site in 1961.

The tanker &quot;Northern Gulf&quot; struck West Cod Ledge off Two Lights State Park in November 1963, spilling at least 20,000 gallons of oil into waters at the outer edge of Casco Bay. The oil slick eventually washed up on shores north of Casco Bay after a storm. A federal judge ruled the U.S. Coast Guard was to blame for the accident, by failing to ensure that a buoy for navigation was in the correct position.

In 1969, Wolfe&#x27;s Neck Woods State Park was established on 244 acres of land in Freeport, on the peninsula formed by the Harraseeket River and Casco Bay.

Lion Ferry established seasonal service in 1970 at International Marine Terminal in Portland for ferry service to and from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, initially on the ferry ships &quot;M/S Prince of Fundy&quot; and MS &quot;Bolero&quot; followed by MS &quot;Caribe&quot;. Lion Ferry sold the route in 1982 to Prince of Fundy Cruises under Panamanian-based Transworld Steamship Company, which began service with M/S &quot;Scotia Prince&quot;. The ship and line were purchased in 2000 by a group of investors and renamed Scotia Prince Cruises. After the discovery of mold at International Marine Terminal, the 2005 Scotia Prince Cruises season was cancelled and the city of Portland ended the company&#x27;s lease.

In July 1972, the Wilh. Wilhelmsen tanker &quot;Tamano&quot; scraped Soldier Ledge while traversing Hussey Sound, tearing open a section of its hull along a starboard tank. With the ship&#x27;s contact with the ledge initially unnoticed by the crew, &quot;Tamano&quot; continued to a ship anchorage and oil transfer area between Long Island and Clapboard Island. An estimated 100,000 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil leaked into Casco Bay, with at least 30,000 gallons escaping containment booms set up around the ship for skimming operations. Over two weeks of containment and cleanup before &quot;Tamano&quot; departed Casco Bay for dry dock repairs, oil was observed on 18 islands and 46 miles of coastline from Yarmouth to York. Oil-contaminated sand six inches deep was removed from West Beach on Long Island and transported to a landfill at Brunswick Naval Air Station, while contaminated straw used to absorb oil in the water, seaweed, and other debris was burned at a site in Gray.

After dead seabirds were found in September 1972 in Massachusetts, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Marine Lab in Gloucester discovered algae in seawater that accumulate in shellfish, which are toxic to humans and animals if consumed. It was the first recorded outbreak of red tide on the Maine coast. Toxicity levels 100 times above safe thresholds were found. Governor Kenneth M. Curtis ordered the closure of the entirety of the Maine coast to shellfish harvesting.

In 1973, the Maine Legislature enacted the Maine Coastal Island Registry, which gave people 10 years to file claims with the state of ownership of ledges and islands with three or fewer structures, with unclaimed properties reverting to state ownership. Intended to bring clarity to ownership and discourage developers from staking claims of land with no recorded deeds, the law was sponsored by State Senator Joseph E. Brennan, who said, &quot;In many ways the islands are like public lots—a valuable public asset that has been grossly underutilized because the state&#x27;s legal rights have been unclear and even the exact location has been in doubt.&quot;

Naval shipyard Bath Iron Works undertook an expansion of Maine State Pier in Portland starting in 1981 for a ship overhaul and outfitting facility there, at an initial cost projection of $46.7 million with financing from the state of Maine and the city of Portland. BIW installed a dry dock in Portland with a lifting capacity of more than 24,000 tons, triple the capacity of its dry dock in Bath. BIW ran the Portland shipyard until 2001.

The oil tanker &quot;Julie N.&quot; struck the Million Dollar Bridge on September 27, 1996, breaching a tank. An estimated 180,000 gallons of home heating oil spilled into the Fore River estuary, with containment measures only partially successful.

In 1997, construction was completed on the Casco Bay Bridge over the Fore River as a replacement span for the Million Dollar Bridge connecting Portland and South Portland.

Operation was curtailed in 2016 of the Portland-Montreal petroleum pipeline, after 75 years of service.

A swimmer died in June 2020 after being bitten by a great white shark off Bailey Island, the first recorded fatality as the result of a shark attack in Casco Bay. A state official said the following day, &quot;It&#x27;s not something we ever would have considered in Maine waters.&quot;

Two powerful storm systems hit Maine&#x27;s coastal counties three days apart in January 2024, with winds reaching hurricane force at points on the shore and islands, and flooding prompting the rescue of dozens of people in Cumberland and York counties from homes and vehicles. The storms caused an estimated $70 million in damage in eight coastal Maine counties. The storm caused extensive damage to boats, buildings, docks, piers and other coastal infrastructure throughout Casco Bay, including the destruction of Eagle Island&#x27;s pier that closed the state historic site for the 2024 season. The fishing vessel &quot;Jacob Pike&quot; sank in shallow waters in the New Meadows River section of Casco Bay, and a fishing trawler went aground at Cape Elizabeth.

== Marine economy ==
A 2017 University of Southern Maine study commissioned by the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership estimated that the Casco Bay region&#x27;s &quot;ocean economy&quot; supported $704 million in annual economic activity and 18,500 jobs, 70% of the spending linked to recreation.

South Portland&#x27;s seven petroleum terminals have storage capacity for 8.6 million barrels of oil, with half the state of Maine&#x27;s home heating oil arriving through the Port of Portland.
In October 2011, Portland completed $27 million in upgrades at Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal that allowed for operators of large cruise ships to add the city to their ports of call. The city was on pace for its busiest cruise ship season ever in 2024, with just over 150 cruise ships scheduled to visit with some 200,000 passengers.

Cumberland County lobster harvesters trapped about 11.1 million pounds of lobsters in 2023, at a market value of about $59.3 million. Dating back two decades, 2016 was the peak harvest year with nearly 14.4 million pounds of lobster landed by Cumberland County licensees, for $61.5 million in revenue.

Portland has a fleet of offshore fishing vessels that offload their catch primarily at the Portland Fish Exchange. In 2022, landings totaled nearly 9.8 million pounds of seafood at a market value of $21.3 million according to NOAA Fisheries, ranking Portland fourth among Maine ports after Stonington, Vinalhaven and Friendship. Landings peaked in 1993 at $49.1 million.

As of October 2024, the Maine Department of Marine Resources listed more than 50 active aquaculture site leases in Casco Bay managed by more than 30 operators, totaling about 220 acres for the nurture and harvest of oysters, clams, mussels, scallops and sugar kelp.

Portland Schooner Co. offers windjammer cruises on four historic schooners in its fleet in &quot;Bagheera&quot; and &quot;Wendameen&quot; built in Boothbay, &quot;Timberwind&quot; built in Portland and &quot;Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot; built in South Freeport, as well as on a historic, gaff-rigged sloop called &quot;Vela&quot;. 

The state of Maine listed 40 fishing charter boats operating in Cumberland County as of 2023.

Casco Bay municipalities hold annual tourist events linked to the bay, to include MS HarborFest in Portland and South Portland which includes the MS Harborfest Regatta, a tugboat muster and races, and the Portland Harbor installment of the Maine Lobster Boat Races, with the circuit having staged races off Harpswell and Long Island as well over the years. The city of Portland holds its annual independence day fireworks display at the Eastern Promenade, drawing spectators to other parts of the harbor shore and on boats in the harbor.

The Yarmouth Clam Festival has drawn an estimated 80,000 people over three days, with 2024 contest registrations logging attendees from more than 30 states and 13 countries.

Portland Harbor has hosted multiple tall ship festivals, including OpSail 2000 and Tall Ships Portland in 2015.

== Transportation ==
Casco Bay Lines provides ferry service from the Maine State Pier in Portland to Peaks, Little Diamond, Great Diamond, Long, Chebeague and Cliff islands, along with specialty cruises on the bay for tourists. Casco Bay Lines also runs a vehicle ferry between Portland and Peaks Island. In 2022, Casco Bay Lines recorded more than 997,300 passenger boardings, a gain of more than 51,000 passenger trips from 2013.

The independent Chebeague Island Ferry provides service from Cousins Island, and Bustins Island operates a seasonal ferry to South Freeport.

Other Casco Bay services such as water taxis operate as alternatives to ferries, but are limited to six passengers per boat.

==Environmental conservation==
The Gulf of Maine Research Institute has its headquarters at Union Wharf in Portland, thought to be the oldest commercial pier in Portland dating back to 1793. In 2024, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute released its inaugural Casco Bay Ecosystem Monitoring Report to track impacts on the environment over time.

Multiple nonprofits exist to marshal resources toward rehabilitating and protecting Casco Bay&#x27;s natural environment, to include the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership and Friends of Casco Bay.

A number of land trusts protect portions of the Casco Bay shore and islands from development with the goal of maintaining their natural state, to include the Brunswick-Topsham Land Trust; the Cape Elizabeth Land Trust; the Chebeague &amp; Cumberland Land Trust; the Eastern Trail Alliance; the Falmouth Land Trust; the Freeport Conservation Trust; the Great Diamond Island Land Preserve; the Maine Coast Heritage Trust; the Oceanside Conservation Trust of Casco Bay; the Maine Island Trail Association; the Harpswell Heritage Land Trust; the Peaks Island Land Preserve; Portland Trails; the Royal River Conservation Trust; and the South Portland Land Trust.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry includes a section of Casco Bay in its Focus Areas of Statewide Ecological Significance program. The Maquoit and Middle Bay Focus Area extends roughly from Princes Point and Cousins Island in Yarmouth to Harpswell, including the intervening shoreline and a number of islands.

In 2020, Bowdoin College completed construction of its expanded Schiller Coastal Studies Center on Orr&#x27;s Island, including a lab and four residential buildings for students.

The piece received critical acclaim from the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; and from fellow Maine composers.

==Media==
The National Trust for Local News acquired the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; and the &quot;Maine Sunday Telegram&quot; in 2023, establishing the Maine Trust for Local News to oversee the newspapers which frequently report on Casco Bay&#x27;s environment and developments. Both newspapers trace their history to the 1862 establishment of the &quot;Portland Daily Press&quot; and the 1803 start of the &quot;Eastern Argus&quot; which was later absorbed by &quot;The Portland Herald&quot;. An affiliated newspaper called &quot;The Evening Express&quot; ran until 1991 when it was discontinued by Guy Gannett Publishing Co., which owned all three newspapers at the time. The Maine Trust for Local News also publishes &quot;The Forecaster&quot; line of weekly newspapers that cover municipalities along Casco Bay, and the weekly South Portland Sentry.

Television and radio broadcaster Maine Public operates a Portland studio and affiliated website that reports frequently on news and issues affecting Casco Bay and its waterfront communities. Other TV stations that report on Casco Bay issues include Hearst Television affiliate WMTW, Sinclair Broadcasting&#x27;s WGME-TV, Tegna&#x27;s WCSH and Cunningham Broadcasting&#x27;s WPFO Fox 23.

Founded in 1983 and based in Rockland, the Island Institute publishes &quot;The Working Waterfront&quot; monthly which reports on the marine economy and environmental issues statewide, including in Casco Bay.

New England Business Media launched the bi-weekly print publication &quot;MaineBiz&quot; in 1994, which includes Casco Bay developments and issues in its reporting.

The nonprofit &quot;Harpswell Anchor&quot; publishes a monthly newspaper that includes news on Bailey and Orr&#x27;s islands.

The &quot;Casco Bay Weekly&quot; ran from 1988 to 2004. The Breeze Publishing Co. ran &quot;Casco Bay Breeze&quot; from 1901 to 1917, weekly during the summer and monthly the rest of the year.

<doc id="560821" wikidata="Q233219" url="?curid=560821" title="Second Battle of Ypres">
<text>During the First World War, the Second Battle of Ypres was fought from 22 April – 25 May 1915 for control of the tactically important high ground to the east and south of the Flemish town of Ypres in western Belgium. The First Battle of Ypres had been fought the previous autumn. The Second Battle of Ypres was the first mass use by Germany of poison gas on the Western Front.

==Background==

The German chemist Walther Nernst, who in 1914 was as a volunteer driver, proposed to Colonel Max Bauer, the German general staff officer responsible for liaison with scientists, that they could empty the opposing trenches by a surprise attack with tear gas. Observing a field test of this idea, the chemist Fritz Haber instead proposed using chlorine gas that was heavier-than-air.

The German commander Erich von Falkenhayn agreed to try the new weapon but intended to use it in a diversionary attack by the 4th Army. Falkenhayn wanted to use the gas to cover the transfer of Imperial German Army units to the Eastern Front to assist its ally Austria-Hungary with the Gorlice–Tarnów offensive against the Russian Empire. The gas would be released by siphoning liquid chlorine out of cylinders; the gas could not be released directly because the valves would freeze; wind would carry the gas to the enemy lines. 5,730 gas cylinders, the largest weighing , were carried into the front line. Installation was supervised by Haber, Otto Hahn, James Franck and Gustav Hertz. Twice cylinders were breached by shell fire, the second time three men were killed and fifty wounded. Some of the Germans were protected by miners&#x27; oxygen breathing apparatus.

The Ypres salient was selected for the attack. It followed the canal, bulging eastward around the town. North of the salient, the Belgian army held the line of the Yser and the north end of the salient was held by two French divisions. The eastern part of the salient was defended by the Canadian Division and two British divisions. The II Corps and V Corps of the Second Army comprised the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions and the 4th, 27th, 28th, Northumbrian, Lahore and 1st Canadian divisions.

==Battle==
In &quot;A record of the Engagements...&quot; (1923) E. A. James used &quot;The Official Names of the Battles and Other Engagements...&quot; (1921) to provide a summary of each engagement and the formations involved. In The Battles of Ypres, 1915 six engagements involving the Second Army were recorded, four during the Second Battle (22 April – 25 May).
* Battle of Gravenstafel: 
* Battle of St. Julien: 
* Battle of Frezenberg: 
* Battle of Bellewaarde: 

===Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22–23 April 1915)===

On 22 April 1915 at about , the 4th Army released of chlorine gas on a front between the hamlets of Langemark and Gravenstafel This sector of the Allied line was held by the 87th Territorial Division (comprising older reservists from 10th Military District, headquartered in Rennes), alongside the 45th Infantry Division (France) (comprising troops from the (North African) 19th Military District). The French troops in the path of the gas cloud suffered with fatalities. Troops fled in all directions,

A gap in the French front was left undefended. German infantry followed well behind the cloud, breathing through cotton pads soaked with sodium thiosulfate solution, and occupied the villages of Langemark and Pilkem, where they dug in, even though they might have occupied Ypres almost unopposed. They had taken 2,000 prisoners and 51 guns. Canadian troops defending the southern flank of the break-in identified chlorine because it smelled like their drinking water. The Germans released more chlorine gas at them the following day. Casualties were especially heavy for the 13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada) of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), which was enveloped on three sides and had over-extended its left flank after the Algerians of the 45th Division broke.

In an action at Kitcheners&#x27; Wood, the 10th Battalion of the 2nd Canadian Brigade was ordered to counter-attack in the gap created by the gas attack. They formed up after on 22 April, with the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) of the 3rd Brigade arriving to support the advance. Both battalions attacked with over in waves of two companies each, at Without reconnaissance, the battalions ran into obstacles halfway to their objective. Engaged by small-arms fire from the wood, they began an impromptu bayonet charge. The attack cleared the former oak plantation of Germans at a 75 per cent casualty rate. The British press were confused by the attack:

The Germans reported that they treated 200 gas casualties, 12 of whom died. The Allies reported 5,000 killed and 15,000 wounded.

Within days the British were advised by John Scott Haldane to counter the effects of the gas by urinating into a cloth and breathing through it. Both sides set about developing more effective gas masks.

===Battle of St. Julien (24 April – 5 May)===
The village of St. Julien (now Sint-Juliaan; ) was in the rear of the 1st Canadian Division until the poison-gas attack of 22 April, when it became the front line. Some of the first fighting in the village involved the stand of Lance Corporal Frederick Fisher of the 13th Battalion CEF&#x27;s machine-gun detachment; Fisher went out twice with a handful of men and a Colt machine gun, preventing advancing German troops from passing through St. Julien into the rear of the Canadian front line. He was killed the following day.

On the morning of 24 April, the Germans released another gas cloud towards the re-formed Canadian line just west of St. Julien. Word was passed to the troops to urinate on their handkerchiefs and place them over their nose and mouth. The countermeasures were insufficient, and German troops took the village. The next day the York and Durham brigades of the Northumbrian Division counter-attacked, failing to secure their objectives but establishing a new line closer to the village. On 26 April the 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions of the Northumberland Brigade, the first Territorial brigade to go into action, attacked and gained a foothold in the village but were forced back, having suffered Despite hundreds of casualties, the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers participated without respite in the battles at Frezenberg and Bellewaarde. On 24 April the battalion, subjected to a German gas attack near St. Julien, was nearly annihilated.

The German Army first used chlorine-gas cylinders in April 1915 against the French Army at Ypres, when yellow-green clouds drifted towards the Allied trenches. The gas had a distinctive odour, resembling pineapple and pepper. The French officers, assuming at first that the German infantry were advancing behind a smoke screen, alerted the troops. When the gas reached the front Allied trenches, soldiers began to complain of chest pains and a burning sensation in the throat.
Captain Francis Scrimger of the 2nd Canadian Field Ambulance may have passed the order to use urine to counteract the gas, on the advice of Lieutenant-Colonel George Gallie Nasmith. Soldiers realised they were being gassed and many ran as fast as they could. An hour after the attack began, there was a gap in the Allied line. Fearing the chlorine, few German soldiers moved forward and the delay enabled Canadian and British troops to retake the position before the Germans could exploit the gap.

After the first German chlorine-gas attacks, Allied troops were supplied with masks of cotton pads soaked in urine; it had been discovered that the urea in the pad neutralised the chlorine. The pads were held over the face until the gas dispersed. Other soldiers preferred to use a handkerchief, sock or flannel body-belt, dampened with a sodium bicarbonate solution and tied across the mouth and nose, until the gas passed. Soldiers found it difficult to fight like this, and attempts were made to develop a better means of protection against gas attacks. By July 1915, soldiers received efficient gas masks and anti-asphyxiation respirators. Private W. Hay of the Royal Scots arrived in Ypres just after the chlorine-gas attack on 22 April 1915:

===Battle of Frezenberg (8–13 May)===

The Germans moved field artillery forward, placing three army corps opposite the 27th and 28th Divisions on the Frezenberg ridge (). The German attack began on 8 May with a bombardment of the 83rd Brigade in trenches on the forward slope of the ridge, but the first and second infantry assaults were repelled by the survivors. The third German assault of the morning pushed the defenders back. Although the neighbouring 80th Brigade repulsed the attack, the 84th Brigade was pushed back; this left a gap in the line. The Germans were prevented from advancing further by the counter-attacks of the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) and a night move by the 10th Brigade. The PPCLI had a costly success; their 700 men were reduced to 150, who were in no shape to fight.

===Battle of Bellewaarde (24–25 May)===
On 24 May the Germans released a gas attack that hit Shell Trap Farm and to the area around the north west, which was affected the most by the attack. A report of the event by Captain Thomas Leahy, of the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers, shows that their C.O. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Loveband suspected a gas attack and had warned all company officers. Later the Germans threw up red lights over their trench, which would signal a gas release.

German forces managed to advance and occupy the British line to north and left of the Battalion. The Battalion was now under heavy fire from the German forces. But with shellfire and the aid from the 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders they managed to hold their trenches to the end.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
By the end of the battle, British forces had withdrawn to a new line 3 miles closer to Ypres, thereby resulting in a compression of its surrounding salient. The city, bombarded by artillery fire, was demolished. Although poison gas had been used on the Eastern Front, it surprised the Allies and about 7,000 gas casualties were transported in field ambulances and treated in casualty clearing stations. In May and June, 350 British deaths were recorded from gas poisoning. Both sides developed gas weapons and counter-measures, which changed the nature of gas warfare; the French and British used gas at the Battle of Loos in late September. Gas protection was somewhat improved with the issue of improvised respirators made from cotton waste pads impregnated with sodium hyposulphite, sodium bicarbonate and glycerin. The respirators made little difference, however, due to lack of training and the use of local contraptions and poorly made items imported from Britain. The &quot;P helmet&quot; (or &quot;Tube Helmet&quot;) soaked in sodium phenate was issued by December 1915, and the PH helmet (effective against phosgene) was issued in early 1916.

Although many French troops ran for their lives, others stood their ground and waited for the cloud to pass. Field Marshal Sir John French, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, wrote,

The Canadian Division mounted an effective defence but had 5,975 casualties by its withdrawal on 3 May. The division was unprepared for the warfare prevailing on the Western Front, where linear tactics were ineffective against attackers armed with magazine rifles and machine guns. The Canadian field artillery had been effective but the deficiencies of the Ross rifle worsened tactical difficulties. The Canadian Division received several thousand replacements shortly after the battle. At Second Ypres, the smallest tactical unit in the infantry was a company; by 1917 it would be the section. The Canadians were employed offensively later in 1915 but not successfully. The battle was the beginning of a long period of analysis and experiment to improve the effectiveness of Canadian infantry weapons, artillery and liaison between infantry and artillery.

===Casualties===
After the war, German casualties from 21 April to 30 May were recorded as 34,933 by the official historians of the . In the British Official History, J. E. Edmonds and G. C. Wynne recorded British losses of 59,275 casualties, the French about 18,000 casualties on 22 April and another 3,973 from Canadian casualties from 22 April to 3 May were 5,975, of whom about 1,000 men were killed. The worst day was 24 April, when were suffered during infantry attacks, artillery bombardments and gas discharges. In 2003, Clayton wrote that thousands of men of the 45th and 87th divisions ran from the gas but that the number of casualties was low. The Germans overran both divisions&#x27; artillery but the survivors rallied and held a new line further back. In 2010, Humphries and Maker, in their translated edition of &quot;Der Weltkrieg&quot; recorded that by 9 May, there had been more than 35,000 German casualties, 59,275 British between 22 April and 31 May and very many French casualties, 18,000 on 22 April alone. In 2012, Sheldon gave similar figures and in 2014, Greenhalgh wrote that French casualties had been exaggerated by propaganda against German &quot;frightfulness&quot; and that in 1998, Olivier Lepick had estimated that were killed by gas in April out of casualties.

<text>Daniel Alexander Grout (January 5, 1862 – February 27, 1929), was a school teacher and principal and school board administrator.

==Career==
Daniel Grout was born at St. Thomas, Canada West, and graduated from St. Thomas Normal School in 1884. After three terms as a teacher he was made principal of schools in Sparta, Ontario and Aldboro, Ontario. He traveled to Oregon in 1890 and graduated from the University of Oregon&#x27;s law school.
Grout first served in Portland, Oregon as the principal of North Central School from 1892 to 1895. He was the principal of the Atkinson School until 1896 and was then made principal of the Park School. He continued working at Park until 1907, and then was made principal of East Side High School. Shortly after this, the position of assistant superintendent was created over the Portland Public Schools. He became superintendent in 1918 and held that office until he retired on January 1, 1926 due to poor health. He died in February 1929.

Soon after his retirement, the school board named a new elementary school in his honor, which still exists today at 3119 SE Holgate Boulevard in Portland.

<doc id="560828" wikidata="Q7361286" url="?curid=560828" title="Rollo Duke of Normandy">
<text>Rollo Duke of Normandy, also known as The Bloody Brother, is a play written in collaboration by John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, Ben Jonson and George Chapman. The title character is the historical Viking duke of Normandy, Rollo (lived 846 – ). Scholars have disputed almost everything about the play; but it was probably written sometime in the 1612–24 era and later revised, perhaps in 1630 or after. In addition to the four writers cited above, the names of Nathan Field and Robert Daborne have been connected with the play by individual scholars.

==Synopsis==
Rollo, Duke of Normandy, is locked in a struggle for power with his brother Otto. Urged on by the sycophantic LaTorch, Rollo eventually murders Otto.

After he commits a number of other bloodthirsty deeds, Rollo is lured into a private meeting with the beautiful Edith, daughter of one of his victims, who plots to murder him. As Edith hesitates, Hamond, captain of the guard and brother of another of Rollo&#x27;s victims, breaks in and murders Rollo. Hamond is himself killed in the process.

Aubrey, Rollo&#x27;s cousin, succeeds to the dukedom; he has Edith cloistered and LaTorch whipped and hanged.

==Performance and publication==
Details of the play&#x27;s earliest productions are not preserved in the historical record. The play was seen at the Globe Theatre on 13 May 1633, and was acted at Hampton Court Palace on 24 January 1637 (new style). It was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 4 October 1639 by the booksellers John Crook and Richard Sergier, as the work of &quot;J. B.&quot; It was first published later in 1639, in a quarto printed by R. Bishop for John Crook and Thomas Allot, under the title &quot;The Bloody Brother&quot;. The title page of this quarto attributes the play to &quot;B. J. F.&quot; A second quarto appeared in 1640 under the title &quot;The Tragoedy of Rollo Duke of Normandy&quot;, published at Oxford by stationer Leonard Lichfield, &quot;Printer to the University.&quot; Q2 assigns the play to Fletcher, and asserts that it was acted by the King&#x27;s Men. Q2 appears to derive from a theatre prompt-book, while Q1 shows less sign of direct contact with the stage and is a more &quot;literary&quot; text. The play was included in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679.

Though the theatres were officially closed from 1642 to 1660, surreptitious performances occurred sporadically through the era. 1647 was a year of relative official lenience, when the actors were surprisingly active; but the London authorities soon cracked down. On 5 February 1648, King&#x27;s Men players were arrested in the midst of a clandestine performance of &quot;Rollo&quot; at the Cockpit Theatre. Joseph Taylor was acting Rollo; John Lowin played Aubrey, Charles Hart Otto; Nicholas Burt was Latorch, and Thomas Pollard the Cook. The actors were arrested, and imprisoned in Hatton House for a time; their costumes were confiscated.

==Authorship==
Scholars have been divided about the nature of the play&#x27;s authorship. Some have regarded it as a play that was originally written by Jonson and Chapman and later revised by Fletcher and Massinger; while this scheme makes a good deal of sense, others have disputed it. In his sweeping study of authorship problems in the Fletcher canon, Cyrus Hoy provided this breakdown among the shares of the four dramatists —

:Massinger — Act I; Act V, scene 1 (lines 1–90);
:Massinger and Fletcher —Act V, 1 (remainder) and 2 (first part);
:Fletcher — Act II; Act III, 1 (middle portion) and 2; Act V, 2 (second part);
:Chapman — Act III, 1 (excluding middle portion); Act IV, 3;
:Jonson — Act IV, 1–2.

<text>Only You is Harry Connick Jr.&#x27;s 17th album from Columbia Records, released in February 2004, consisting of versions of songs from the 1920s to the 1960s. A Grammy nominated album, which has made the top ten album charts on both sides of the Atlantic and was certified gold in March 2004, and platinum in July 2004.

&quot;Only You&quot; debuted at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 140,000 copies in its first week. It also made the top ten of the UK album charts and the Australian top 40 charts.

==Background==

The initial idea for the album came from Donnie Ierner, the President of Columbia Records who suggested that Connick produce an album of songs that the baby boomers grew up with. In May 2003, Harry Connick Jr entered Capitol Studios to make both &quot;Harry for the Holidays&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot;. Whilst playing from the piano once used by Nat King Cole, he led his big band through the selection of Christmas songs and 1950s and 1960s.

On his website, Harry Connick Jr. explained that he wanted to perform songs with a real history to them. &quot;Part of what I wanted to do on this record, &quot;was to focus on songs that had their second success in the Fifties. &quot;My Prayer&quot; is a great example. I know that most people associate it with the Platters, but I knew the Ink Spots&#x27; version from the Thirties as well. That&#x27;s why I picked things like &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; and &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You,&quot; songs I remember hearing as a kid that have a real history.&quot;

<text>Tommaso Michele Francesco Saverio Traetta (30 March 1727 – 6 April 1779), was an Italian composer of the Neapolitan School. Along with other composers mainly in the Holy Roman Empire and France, he was responsible for certain operatic reforms including reducing the ornateness of style and the primacy of star singers.

== Biography ==
Traetta was born in Bitonto, a town near Bari in the Apulia region of Italy. He was a student of a composer, singer, and teacher Nicola Porpora in Naples, and found early success with his opera &quot;Il Farnace&quot; in 1751. Around this time, he came into contact with Niccolò Jommelli. Traetta found regular commissions throughout Italy, before accepting a post as court composer at Parma in 1759.

The ruler of Parma, Philip, Duke of Parma had married the eldest daughter of Louis XV. In Parma, there was a craving for all things French and the splendor of Versailles.

It was in Parma that Traetta&#x27;s operas first moved in new directions. As a result, &quot;Antigona&quot;, his 1772 opera for Saint Petersburg, was amongst his most forward-looking, the closest he approached the famous reform ideals usually associated with Gluck.

It was at the court of the Duke of Bourbon-Parma, that Traetta ran into some fresh air from France. In Parma in 1759, he found several noteworthy collaborators, and he was fortunate in finding that the man in charge of opera there was a highly cultivated Paris-trained Frenchman, Guillaume du Tillot, who had the complete cultural portfolio among all his other responsibilities as Don Felipe&#x27;s First Minister. To judge from the general stylistic influence in terms of grand scenic effects, and from some specific musical borrowings, Traetta had access in Parma to copies and reports of Rameau&#x27;s operas. To their influence, Traetta added some ingredients of his own, especially a feeling for dramatic colour, in the shape of his melodies and his use of the orchestra. The result was a combination of Italian, French, and German elements, which even expected the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement to flourish a few years later, further North.

The first fruit of this Francophilia was the opera Traetta wrote in 1759. &quot;Ippolito ed Aricia&quot; owes a lot to Rameau&#x27;s great tragédie lyrique of 1733, &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot;. But Traetta&#x27;s is no mere translation of Rameau. Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni, Traetta&#x27;s librettist in Parma, completely reworked the original French version by abbé Pellegrin, which itself had been based on Racine, in its turn stemming ultimately from ancient Greek roots–the &quot;Hippolytus&quot; of Euripides. Frugoni kept certain key French elements: the five-act structure as against the customary three; the occasional opportunities for French-style spectacle and effects and, in particular, the dances and divertissements that end each of those five acts; and more elaborate use of the chorus than, for instance, in Hasse and Graun and Jommelli.

Through the following decade, the 1760s, Tommaso Traetta composed music (including opera seria) unceasingly. There was a clutch of comedies as well, and sacred music composed to imperial order. For Traetta served from 1768 to 1775 as music director for Catherine the Great of Russia, to which he moved. Still, opera seria was what her imperial majesty commanded. Traetta&#x27;s first operas for Catherine the Great seem to have been largely revivals and revisions of his earlier works. In 1772 came &quot;Antigona&quot;, which reached areas of expression he had not explored before.

The Court Opera of Catherine the Great performed in a theatre close to her apartments inside of the Winter Palace itself, created by the Italian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, architect of many buildings in Saint Petersburg, including the Hermitage. In 1783, sometime after Traetta&#x27;s departure, she ordered it to be closed and a new one built. Traetta departed Saint Petersburg in 1775, and resumed the opera composer&#x27;s life, even writing two works for London: &quot;Germondo&quot; in 1776 and &quot;Telemaco&quot; in 1777. According to the Traetta Association in Bitonto, he had left Saint Petersburg under threat of assassination by the empress—it seems he was enraged that she insisted on a happy ending for Antigona, and in revenge put music for Polish independence into the final chaconne. He left in time, but his librettist was poisoned.

Traetta was shortly married and had a son, Filippo Traetta, who in 1800 moved to America and became a fairly successful composer. Tommaso Traetta died in April of 1779, in Venice.

<doc id="560837" wikidata="Q1228304" url="?curid=560837" title="Dirty Work (1998 film)">
<text>Dirty Work is a 1998 American comedy film directed by Bob Saget. The film follows long-time friends Mitch (Norm Macdonald) and Sam (Artie Lange) who start a revenge-for-hire business, and work to fund heart surgery for Sam&#x27;s father Pops (Jack Warden). Christopher McDonald and Traylor Howard also star, and notable cameo appearances include Don Rickles, Rebecca Romijn, John Goodman (uncredited), Gary Coleman, Chevy Chase, David Koechner, Chris Farley (uncredited in his final film appearance), and Adam Sandler (uncredited).

The film was the first starring vehicle for Macdonald and Lange, and the directorial debut of Saget, coming one year after he left his long-running role as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;.

Upon its theatrical release on June 12, 1998 by MGM, &quot;Dirty Work&quot; received largely negative critical reviews and was a disappointment at the box office. It has since become a cult classic and has been reappraised more positively by some critics. A sequel was planned but ultimately canceled following Macdonald and Saget&#x27;s deaths in the early 2020s.

== Plot ==
Growing up, friends Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna are taught by Sam&#x27;s hard-nosed father, &quot;Pops&quot; McKenna, not to &quot;take crap from anyone&quot;. To that end, the pair plant a bunch of guns in a schoolyard bully&#x27;s desk and have him arrested for gun possession; next, they catch a kid-fondling crossing guard in the act, after having applied Krazy Glue to the seat of Mitch&#x27;s pants.

As adults, after losing fourteen jobs in three months and being dumped by his girlfriend, Mitch moves in with Sam and Pops, who then has a heart attack. In the hospital, Pops confides that, because of their parents&#x27; swinging lifestyle, he is also Mitch&#x27;s father, meaning that Mitch and Sam are half-brothers. Even though Pops&#x27; heart is failing, Dr. Farthing, a hopeless gambler, will raise Mr. McKenna&#x27;s position on the transplant waiting list if he is paid $50,000, to save himself from his bookie. Mitch and Sam get jobs in a cinema with an abusive manager and exact their revenge by showing a gay pornographic film to a packed house and get their manager fired. The other workers congratulate them and suggest they go into business.

Mitch and Sam open &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, a revenge-for-hire business. Mitch falls for a woman named Kathy who works for a shady used car dealer. After publicly embarrassing the dealer during a live television commercial, the duo exacts increasingly lucrative reprisals for satisfied customers until they interfere with unscrupulous local property developer Travis Cole. Cole tricks them into destroying &quot;his&quot; apartment building (actually owned by Mr. John Kirkpatrick, the landlord), promising to pay them enough to save Pops. Afterwards, Cole reneges, revealing that he is not the owner and that he had them vandalize the building so that he could buy it cheaply, evict the tenants (including Kathy&#x27;s grandmother), and build a parking lot for his beloved opera house. Unknown to Cole, Mitch&#x27;s tape recorder captures this confession.

Mitch and Sam plot their revenge on Cole, using the tape to set up an elaborate trap. Using skunks, a loyal army of prostitutes, homeless men, a noseless friend, brownies with hallucinogenic additives, and Pops, they ruin the opening night of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, an opera sponsored prominently by Cole. With the media present, Mitch plays back Cole&#x27;s confession over the theater&#x27;s sound system. Cole sees that his public image is being tarnished and agrees to pay the $50,000. In the end, Cole is punched in the stomach, arrested and jailed, his dog is raped by a skunk, Pops gets his operation, and Mitch gets the girl. Dr. Farthing overcomes his gambling habit, but gets beaten to death by the bookies anyway.

== Production and release ==
Filmed at Wycliffe College and elsewhere around Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1997, the film was produced for an estimated $13 million.

In his first appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on September 18, 2008, Chevy Chase discussed the film&#x27;s production and release with Artie Lange. According to Chase, he was impressed by the original script&#x27;s raunchy, R-rated, &quot;over the top&quot; tone (particularly a filmed but ultimately cut gag involving Macdonald and Lange delivering donuts that had been photographed around their genitals) and, Lange related, went so far as to beg Macdonald not to allow any changes—to &quot;keep it funny&quot;. Lange said the studio insisted on a PG-13 rating and moved the film&#x27;s release from the February dump months to June, where it fared poorly against blockbusters like &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

During production, Norm Macdonald was embroiled in a feud with Don Ohlmeyer, then an executive with NBC. Ohlmeyer, a friend of O. J. Simpson, took offense at Macdonald&#x27;s frequent and pointed jokes about Simpson on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; and had Macdonald fired from the position. Ohlmeyer went further and refused to sell advertising space or air commercials for &quot;Dirty Work&quot;. NBC eventually relented a week after the film premiered; Ohlmeyer was forced into retirement not long afterward.

&quot;Dirty Work&quot; was Chris Farley&#x27;s last-released film appearance, filmed before his fatal drug overdose in December 1997.

Norm Macdonald offered Howard Stern the role of Satan but he declined. Adam Sandler was eventually cast instead.

MGM Home Entertainment released the film on DVD, in August 1999, and for digital rental/purchase.

== Reception ==
Critics mostly gave negative reviews. It was referred to as a &quot;leaden, taste-deprived attempted comedy&quot; and &quot;a desert of comedy&quot; with only infrequent humor in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;a tone-deaf, scattershot and dispiritingly cheesy affair with more groans than laughs&quot;, and though Macdonald &quot;does uncork a few solid one-liners&quot;, his lack of conviction in his acting &quot;is amusing in and of itself, but it doesn&#x27;t help the movie much&quot;.
The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; recommended the film only for &quot;people who like stupid lowdown vulgar comedy. I had a few good laughs.&quot;

It has a 14% critic rating at Rotten Tomatoes, averaged from 28 reviews. The film has been described as a &quot;cult classic&quot;. In his column, &quot;My Year of Flops&quot;, critic Nathan Rabin describes &quot;Dirty Work&quot; as an example of &quot;the ironic dumb comedy, the slyly postmodern lowbrow gag-fest that so lustily, nakedly embraces and exposes the machinations and conventions of stupid laffers that it becomes a sort of sublime bit of meta-comedy&quot;.

==Discussed sequel ==
When discussing a possible sequel to &quot;Dirty Work&quot; in 2018, Macdonald stated &quot;It was an R-rated movie, so we made it that way, then they made it [PG-13], so half the movie had to be cut. So it&#x27;s hard for me to see it objectively. There might be another one coming now, I guess.&quot; Macdonald did not elaborate further regarding the potential sequel. Bob Saget spoke about the sequel in May 2021 in an interview with Kevin Hart on his podcast, &quot;Comedy Gold Minds&quot;. Hart praised the film&#x27;s moments and innovations, to which Saget replied, &quot;you want to be in the sequel, we&#x27;re making it?&quot;. Hart said he would do a cameo without hesitation, declaring &quot;Dirty Work&quot; to be one of his favorite movies of all time. Macdonald died four months later in September 2021, essentially ending talks of a sequel, followed soon after by Saget’s death in January 2022.

<doc id="560838" wikidata="Q3566154" url="?curid=560838" title="Brookland–CUA station">
<text>Brookland–CUA station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Red Line. Service began on February 3, 1978. The station serves the Brookland neighborhood and the Catholic University of America (CUA). It is the focal point of an upcoming transit-oriented development project.

==History==

The station opened on February 3, 1978. Originally simply known as &quot;Brookland,&quot; in 1979 its name was changed to &quot;Brookland–CUA&quot; due to the proximity of The Catholic University of America to the station.

In the summer of 2018 from July 21 to September 3, the station was shut down for platform repairs due to settling of the platform and decaying concrete caused by salty de-icer used in the winter.

===Transit-oriented development===
Brookland–CUA station is slated to be the center of a massive transport-oriented regeneration with the aim of increasing pedestrian-friendly development and an arts-focused neighborhood. The project includes a relocation of the station portals slightly to the south in a plaza with the western end of 9th, Newton, and Otis Streets which will be extended to the station plaza for more convenient access to the rest of the surrounding area.

In August 2014, Metro picked a joint venture involving MRP Realty and CAS Riegler LLC to begin the redevelopment of the site. The plan called for construction of 280 apartments and condominiums; of ground-floor retail, 228 parking spaces, and the replacement of Metro&#x27;s 38-space Kiss &amp; Ride lot. Metro proposed a 98-year lease that included rent increases, and required the joint venture to seek approval of its plans from the District of Columbia Zoning Commission. At that time, Metro said ground would break on the redevelopment in 2016.

But in January 2015, the joint venture said it would take at least four years before it could complete its plans and obtain zoning commission approval, and that it would not be able to sign a lease until 2019.

==Station layout==
The station has one slightly curved island platform. This curve requires mirrors to be placed on the westbound side of the platform to aid train operators in making sure the area is clear before closing the doors. Brookland–CUA also has a relatively uncommon layout; passengers entering the station first take escalators, stairs, or an elevator down to a lower level which includes the station&#x27;s fare gates and ticket machines, before using escalators or elevators to go back up to reach the platform level; another example of this design is the station. The station&#x27;s elevator between the mezzanine and platform has a single faregate at the mezzanine level, similar to the station.

Like , , and , Brookland–CUA is located in the middle of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision rail line. There are two tracks to either side of the island platform, with Metro trains use the inner tracks and Amtrak and MARC Trains using the outer tracks.

<doc id="560839" wikidata="Q1332542" url="?curid=560839" title="Multiple-unit train control">
<text>Multiple-unit train control, sometimes abbreviated to multiple-unit or MU, is a method of simultaneously controlling all the traction equipment in a train from a single location—whether it is a multiple unit comprising a number of self-powered passenger cars or a set of locomotives—with only a control signal transmitted to each unit. This contrasts with arrangements where electric motors in different units are connected directly to the power supply switched by a single control mechanism, thus requiring the full traction power to be transmitted through the train.

A set of vehicles under multiple unit control is referred to as a consist in the United States.

==Origins==

Multiple unit train control was first used in electric multiple units in the 1890s.

===The Liverpool Overhead Railway===
The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened in 1893 with two-car electric multiple units, controllers in cabs at both ends directly controlling the traction current to motors on both cars.

===Frank J. Sprague===
The multiple unit traction control system was developed by Frank Sprague and first applied and tested on the South Side Elevated Railroad (now part of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;) in 1897. In 1895, derived from his company&#x27;s invention and production of direct current elevator control systems, Frank Sprague invented a multiple unit controller for electric train operation. This accelerated the construction of electric traction railways and trolley systems worldwide. Each car of the train has its own traction motors: by means of motor control relays in each car energized by train-line wires from the front car all of the traction motors in the train are controlled in unison.

==Locomotive applications==

Sprague&#x27;s MU system was adopted for use by diesel–electric locomotives and electric locomotives in the 1920s; however, these early control connections were entirely pneumatic. Today&#x27;s modern MU control utilizes both pneumatic elements for brake control and electric elements for throttle setting, dynamic braking, and fault lights.

In the early days of diesel electric MUing there were numerous systems; some were compatible with one another, but others were not. For example, when first delivered, many F units lacked MU cables on their noses, allowing only for MUing through the rear of the locomotive. That meant that if a train needed four locomotives and there were four A units and no B units, a train would require two train crews as the four A units could not be multiple-unit-controlled, except as two groups of two.
Terms used in North America are A unit and B unit where the B or &quot;booster&quot; unit does not have a control cab; slug where the B unit has traction motors powered by the &quot;mother&quot; unit via extra connections; and cow–calf for switcher locomotive units. A control car remote control locomotive has remote control but not traction equipment.

Most modern diesel locomotives are now delivered equipped for MU operation, allowing a consist (set) of locomotives to be operated from one cab. Not all MU connections are standardized between manufacturers, thus limiting the types of locomotives that can be used together. However, in North America there is a high level of standardization between all railroads and manufacturers using the Association of American Railroads (AAR) system which allows any modern locomotive in North America to be connected to any other modern North American locomotive. In the United Kingdom several incompatible MU systems are in use (and some locomotive classes were never fitted for MU working), but more modern diesel locomotives used on British railways use the standard Association of American Railroads system.

Modern locomotive MU systems can be easily spotted due to the large MU cables to the right and left of the coupler. The connections typically consist of several air hoses for controlling the air brake system, and an electrical cable for the control of the traction equipment. The largest hose, located next to the coupler, is the main air brake line or &quot;train line&quot;. Additional hoses link the air compressors on the locomotives and control the brakes on the locomotives independently of the rest of the train. There are sometimes additional hoses that control the application of sand to the rails.

With distributed power, long trains, e.g. ore trains on mining lines, may have locomotives at each end and at intermediate locations in the train to reduce the maximum drawbar load. The locomotives are often radio-controlled from the lead locomotive by the Locotrol system. Remote control locomotives, e.g. &quot;switchers&quot; in hump yards, may be controlled by a stationary operator. These types of remote control systems often use the AAR MU standard which allows any locomotive using the AAR MU standard to be easily &quot;MU&#x27;ed&quot; to a control receiver and thus capable of becoming remote-controlled.

==Passenger train applications==

Modern electric multiple unit and diesel multiple unit vehicles often utilise a specialised coupler that provides mechanical, electrical and pneumatic connections between vehicles. These couplers permit trains to be connected and disconnected automatically without the need for human intervention on the ground.

There are a few designs of fully automatic couplers in use worldwide, including the Scharfenberg coupler, various knuckle hybrids (such as the Tightlock, used in the UK), the Wedglock coupling, Dellner couplings (similar to Scharfenberg couplers in appearance), and the BSI coupling.

Multiple control technology is also used in push-pull trains operating with a standard locomotive at one end only. Control signals are either received from the cab as normal, or from a cab car at the other end that is connected to the locomotive by cables through the intermediate cars.

In the United States, Amtrak often operates one to three diesel locomotives on routes outside the Northeast corridor with only one operator.

==In trolleybuses==

In the USSR, increased capacity in public transport was necessary, but the local industry had not developed sufficiently to match world trends, such as by the production of articulated trolleybuses, the first of which was the SVARZ-TS, built in 1959 to 1967. It was not until 1963 that the next articulated trolleybus was produced, the ZiU-683. Hence, during this period, to satisfy passenger demand, research started to produce trolleybuses connected in multiple working, which had first successfully run in Kyiv on June 12, 1966. This system was designed by Ukrainian engineer Volodymyr Veklych, and connected two MTB-82D trolleybuses. Although other cities had tried to engineer similar systems, their solutions often resulted in rapid wear of traction motors, due to the vehicles never being intended for such use.

So the invention by Veklych was borrowed by many trolleybus companies, in particular, Donetsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Minsk, Tallinn, Riga, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and many other cities.

The design of the rotating joint was similar to that of a tram with rods and hinges; both trolleybuses would have their motors and brakes controlled by the driver in the front. They also allowed for coupling and decoupling in 3–5 minutes, which was intended such that at the end of peak hours, the trolleybuses could be split again into two. However, due to the abundance of trolleybuses and electricity, there was rarely a need to do so.

With the retirement of the MTB-82 trolleybuses, the system was also adapted to the Skoda 9Tr and the ZiU-5. Due to the lack of need for it, the rapid decoupling system was excluded. From 1973, trolleybuses in Riga also used the coupling of Skoda 9Tr trolleybuses. They would be the longest working coupled Skoda trolleybuses, used until 2001. In 1976, a three trolleybus coupling was tested in Kyiv, but due to sufficient transport, it did not receive further development. With the transition to the next generation of trolleybuses, the ZiU-682, these couplings were once again necessary for higher capacity transport, since the articulated version met constant delays. Although 810 trains were created in various Soviet republics, not a single one has survived in original state.

Throughout its use, the implementation of trolleybus trains have been used in Saint Petersburg, Odesa, Donetsk, Samara, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Moscow, Kemerovo, Sumy, Chelyabinsk, Nikolaev and Krasnodar.

<doc id="560847" wikidata="Q5472194" url="?curid=560847" title="Fort Totten station">
<text>Fort Totten station is a Washington Metro station in northeastern Washington, D.C. It is one of the four major transfer points on the Metrorail system. It acts as a transfer point between the Green and Red Lines. It is the last station on the Green Line in the District of Columbia before heading into Maryland and the second to last for the Red Line. It is one of two stations (the other being Arlington Cemetery) with three levels (the entrance and exit are on the second floor between the three lines), and is doubly unique in being the only multi-level transfer station built above ground and being the only such station to have island platforms on both levels, as opposed to just the lower level. The station&#x27;s name comes from a Civil War-era fortification which itself was named after General Joseph Gilbert Totten, the Chief Engineer of the antebellum US Army.

The station is located in the middle of Fort Totten Park in Northeast, serving the neighborhoods of Fort Totten to the west and Queens Chapel to the east. The station also serves the adjacent neighborhoods of Riggs Park, North Michigan Park, and Michigan Park in Northeast D.C., the Manor Park neighborhood of Northwest, and the Maryland neighborhood of Chillum.

==History==
Service began on the Red Line (upper) platform on February 6, 1978, and on the Green Line (lower) platform on December 11, 1993.

The initial, southern section of the Green Line, between the and stations, opened roughly two years earlier, in December 1991. The northern portion, between the and Fort Totten stations, was completed on December 11, 1993. Between December 1993 and September 1999, the Green Line operated as two separate, unconnected segments because the line between Fort Totten and U Street had not been completed. The underground platform at Fort Totten served as the northern and southern terminus until the mid-city and stations opened.
Passengers traveling between the two Green Line sections had to transfer to Red Line trains at Fort Totten&#x27;s upper level to continue their journey to Downtown Washington, D.C. However, to eliminate this transfer, during weekday rush hour peak commuter times between January 1997 and September 1999, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operated the Green Line Commuter Shortcut that bypassed Fort Totten station and used an underground connection to the Red Line and served all stations up to in Downtown. The Commuter Shortcut was discontinued in September 1999 when the northern and southern portions of the Green Line were connected, and the Georgia Avenue–Petworth and Columbia Heights stations opened.

On December 31, 2006, as part of an 18-month trial, WMATA decided to extend the Yellow Line north of its original terminus at the to Fort Totten at all other times other than during weekday rush hour/peak period commuter times. Signage was replaced at all Green Line Stations between Mount Vernon Square and Fort Totten to reflect this change between December 4, 2006, and January 1, 2007. On June 26, 2008, due to the success of the 18-month trial of the Yellow Line Extension to Fort Totten, WMATA decided to permanently extend the Yellow Line to operate up to Fort Totten at all other times, except weekday rush hour/peak period commuter times. Eventually, in June 2012, as part of the Metro Rush Plus program trial, the Yellow Line trains were extended further north of Fort Totten to operate up to Greenbelt during all other times, except for weekday rush hour/peak period commuter times. On May 25, 2019, the Yellow Line was extended to operate to Greenbelt at all times instead of terminating at Fort Totten during off-peak hours. On May 7, 2023, the Yellow Line was truncated back from Greenbelt to Mount Vernon Square, following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

===2009 Red Line collision===

On June 22, 2009, two southbound Metro trains on the Red Line collided between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations, killing nine and injuring 80, the deadliest accident in the system&#x27;s history. A plaque in the station&#x27;s mezzanine commemorates the victims of the crash. A plan to create a memorial outside the station has been proposed, as the current sign was felt to be insensitive by the victims&#x27; families.

==Station layout==
The lower-level platform for the Green Line is unique in that it is built into a hillside, part underground in a rock tunnel, and part at ground level in an open cut and has separate tunnels and platforms for each direction, instead of the large, vaulted common room seen at most other underground stations in the Metro system like at Forest Glen and Wheaton; this design was used to save money due to the station&#x27;s depth. A single-track connection east of the station allows trains to be moved between the Red and Green Lines and was once used for the Green Line Commuter Shortcut service to Farragut North via the Red Line tracks before the mid-city segment of the Green Line was completed in September 1999.

Like , , and , the Red Line tracks at Fort Totten are located in the middle of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision rail line. There are two tracks to either side of the island platform, with Metro trains using the inner tracks and all freight, Amtrak and MARC Trains using the outer tracks, though neither one makes stops.

Access to the station is provided from Galloway Street NE, which connects to South Dakota Avenue NE to the east and Riggs Road NE to the north.

<text>Takoma station is a Washington Metro station on the Red Line in the Takoma neighborhood of Washington, D.C., bordering Takoma Park, Maryland. The station is considered to be located in part of the Takoma Park Historic District. It is the last station in the District of Columbia on the eastern end of the Red Line heading to Maryland, located east of the intersection of Blair Road NW and Cedar Street NW. The station&#x27;s parking lot and bus stops are accessed from Eastern Avenue NW, which runs along the DC–Maryland border line.

==History==
Prior to the opening of Metrorail, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) operated commuter trains that served intra-DC locations, including Takoma Park (this service continues as MARC&#x27;s Brunswick Line, although the closest station serving the area is in Silver Spring, Maryland). Commuter rail service ended before Metrorail service began, and the old shelter for the rail stop was demolished in order to widen the right-of-way to accommodate Metrorail. Remnants of the Takoma Park B&amp;O rail stop are visible to the west of the Metro station. The original Takoma Park railroad station, located within DC, burned down in 1962.

Construction of the Metrorail Station took place in the early 1970s, and the station shares architectural features with the other above-ground stations constructed across the system. Takoma was among some of the first stations to open in the Metrorail System, less than two years after the system&#x27;s inauguration on March 27, 1976. Service to Takoma began on February 6, 1978.

In 2017, the station was closed from November 25 to December 10 as part of Metro&#x27;s Capital Improvement Program. The work mainly focused on replacing and repairing existing tracks.

The station was closed from June 1 to 28, 2024 to allow for construction of the Purple Line.

===2009 collision===
On June 22, 2009, a southbound Metro train on the Red Line collided with another southbound train, which was stopped between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations, causing the deadliest accident in the system&#x27;s history.

==Station layout==
The entrance to the station is at the street level, with escalators leading up to the platform. A separate accessible entrance consisting of a single elevator is located near the middle of the platform. The separate accessible and general entrances are a relative rarity in the Washington Metro system; only and stations share this feature. The station is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In the event that the elevator is not operational, the station is not accessible for wheelchair users and shuttle service to the next station is provided.

Like NoMa-Gallaudet U, , , and , Takoma is located in the middle of the CSX Metropolitan Subdivision rail line. There are two tracks to either side of the island platform, with Metro trains using the inner tracks and Amtrak and MARC Trains using the outer tracks.

<text>Robert Walser is an American musicologist associated with the &quot;new musicology&quot;. He is author of the book &quot;Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music&quot;, concerning heavy metal music. Walser currently is a member of the faculty at Case Western Reserve University.

Walser has also served as an expert witness for over 250 music copyright infringement cases, generally reserved to the Ninth Circuit. His big success came from a broad statement of support from Circuit Judge William C. Canby, Jr., who fully supported Dr. Walser&#x27;s methodology, despite the less-than-appropriate credibility that Dr. Walser received via District Judge Christina A. Snyder {&quot;see Swirsky v. Carey&quot;, 226 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (C.D. Cal. 2002).

Walser is married to musicologist Susan McClary.

<doc id="560856" wikidata="Q7516347" url="?curid=560856" title="Silver Spring station">
<text>Silver Spring station is a train station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro and the Brunswick Line of the MARC Train commuter rail system. The Metro station averaged 4,536 daily riders in 2023, making it the 19th-busiest stop in the network and the busiest in the state of Maryland. Trains travelling south from the station quickly cross the border into Washington, D.C., while northbound trains head underground and make their way further into Montgomery County.

Silver Spring station mainly serves the populous suburb of Silver Spring and is located east of the intersection between Colesville Road (Route 384) and East-West Highway (Route 410). In addition to rail service, several Metrobus and Ride On bus routes also serve the station at the Paul S. Sarbanes Transit Center, formerly known as the Silver Spring Transit Center.

It will be a stop for the Purple Line light rail system, which is currently under construction.

==History==
Red Line service at Silver Spring began on February 6, 1978. Prior to the opening of Forest Glen on September 22, 1990, Silver Spring was the northeastern terminus of the Red Line. MARC trains began service in this location in 2003, replacing the Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station, located about to the south.

On July 7, 2020, a 7000-series train derailed at low speed on the southbound track as it was leaving the station. There were no injuries. An investigation is underway to determine the cause.

The Purple Line system is under construction as of 2022 and is scheduled to open in 2027.

===Bus station===
On September 26, 2008, there was a groundbreaking ceremony that took place at the Silver Spring Metro Station, as construction of the Silver Spring Transit Center was about to begin two days later. On September 28, 2008, both the original Silver Spring Metro Station Bus Bay where all WMATA Metrobus, Montgomery County Ride-On, and Shuttle UM Bus Routes originally stopped at, as well as the original Silver Spring Metro Station Kiss &amp; Ride Lot were demolished, in order to make room for the construction of the Silver Spring Transit Center. As a result, all bus route terminals were temporarily rerouted to the side streets near the Silver Spring Metro Station until the Silver Spring Transit Center opened. The facility has 34 bays for Metro, Ride-on Buses, Shuttle-UM, &quot;Kiss and Ride&quot; access, Metrorail, and MARC train service. Its increased capacity is expected to ease the implementation of the Purple Line. The Transit Center will also mark the location for the future northern terminus of the Metropolitan Branch Trail, which heads southbound to Washington Union Station. The transit center is named for former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes.

The complex was subject to construction problems and the schedule was extensively delayed.

On March 19, 2013, an engineering firm engaged by Montgomery County to investigate the defects issued a report that indicated &quot;significant and serious design and construction defects, including excessive cracking, missing post-tensioning cables, inadequate reinforcing steel, and concrete of insufficient strength and thickness.&quot;

In May 2014, repairs were announced to begin for the summer with the hope of completing them in time to open by early 2015, but after two months they had not resumed.

The facility was transferred from Montgomery County to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) in August 2015 after the completion of renovations, and opened on September 20, 2015, five years behind schedule.

On June 1, 2024, all Red Line stations north of Fort Totten, including Silver Spring, were closed to allow the Maryland Transit Authority to work on the upcoming Purple Line. Takoma re-opened on June 28, with the rest of the stations scheduled to re-open on September 1st.

==Station layout==
Like Brookland–CUA station, the Red Line island platform at Silver Spring is slightly curved, with convex mirrors located on the inbound side of the platform to aid train operators in making sure the area is clear before closing the doors. There is a pocket track just beyond the WMATA station, which used to be for turning back trains towards Grosvenor–Strathmore in select rush hour trips. The MARC station straddles the Metro station, with a single track and side platform on either side of the Red Line. The MARC platforms are slightly offset from the Metro platform and are connected to each other by a pedestrian bridge. Access between the Red Line and other services is provided via an elevator or escalators from the platform to two ground-level mezzanines, one at the north end of the platform connecting to Colesville Road and one at the center of the platform serving the Transit Center and Metropolitan Branch Trail. Silver Spring station is accessible, with a single elevator between the Metro platform and lobby. Installation of redundant elevators is planned as part of the construction of the Purple Line.

==Public art==
===Penguin Rush Hour===
The Silver Spring station is also home to &quot;Penguin Rush Hour,&quot; a mural painted by Sally Callmer Thompson, depicting penguins as Metro customers during rush hour. Although originally intended to be a temporary exhibit, the mural placed at the station in the early 1990s has become a symbol of the downtown area of Silver Spring. In 2004, the Silver Spring Regional Center, a county government facility, commissioned the original artist to restore the mural, which was damaged by the elements and missing sections, for approximately $30,000. In 2004-2005, the mural was removed for the restoration, with the promise that it would be returned by the end of 2005. Subsequently, the county decided to postpone re-installation of the mural until completion of the new transit center. In March 2017 a digital copy of the mural, printed on aluminum sheets for durability, was installed at the transit center.

<doc id="560859" wikidata="Q5610665" url="?curid=560859" title="Grosvenor–Strathmore station">
<text>Grosvenor–Strathmore station (formerly Grosvenor, pronounced ) is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro in North Bethesda, Maryland. Grosvenor–Strathmore is the last above-ground station for Glenmont-bound Red Line trains until NoMa-Gallaudet U; south of the station, trains cross over the Capital Beltway before descending underground. It is one of a number of stations on the Rockville Pike corridor in Montgomery County.

== Location ==
Named after the nearby Grosvenor Lane, Grosvenor–Strathmore station lies within the unincorporated area of North Bethesda. Located to the east of Rockville Pike at its intersection with Tuckerman Lane, the main point of interest near the station is the Music Center at Strathmore. In addition, it is the first stop outside of the Capital Beltway heading outbound towards Shady Grove on the Red Line.

== History ==
Service to Grosvenor (named for its proximity to Grosvenor Lane) began on August 25, 1984. Grosvenor Lane was located at the farm of Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (1875–1966), the father of photojournalism and the first full-time editor of &quot;National Geographic&quot; from 1899 to 1954. He moved there from the Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C. after buying the farmland in 1912.

The station&#x27;s opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness–UDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Friendship Heights, Medical Center and Tenleytown stations. It remained the western terminus of the Red Line until the extension of that line to Shady Grove that December. Trains from Silver Spring terminated here during peak times until December 2018.

In February 2005, the Music Center at Strathmore opened adjacent to the station, prompting the name change to Grosvenor–Strathmore. The arts complex and station are connected via an elevated pedestrian walkway, the Carlton R. Sickles Memorial Sky Bridge. Escalators and an underground walkway were also added to the station to allow customers to easily cross the busy road, Rockville Pike, that is adjacent to the station.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

== Station layout ==
Grosvenor has one island platform located just east of Rockville Pike. Access to the station is provided by a passageway connecting the Pike and a large parking lot and garage east of the station. Bus bays and a kiss and ride lot are east of the station, but there is also a bus stop west of the station on Rockville Pike. The tracks in the open cut continue in a tunnel northwest of the station, and becomes briefly elevated south of the station before going underground.

There is also a short pocket track just past the station going northwest.

<doc id="560862" wikidata="Q8067557" url="?curid=560862" title="Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up">
<text>The Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up was set up in 1999 as the think-tank of the Arab League. It was named after and principally funded by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). His son, Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the deputy prime-minister of the UAE, served as its chairman.

Based in Abu Dhabi, the center hosted lectures by notable personalities such as former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, and former French President Jacques Chirac. The think-tank, however, became embroiled in controversy when it became known that it also disseminated and provided a platform for anti-American, anti-Semitic, and extreme anti-Israel views. As a result of international outcry, Sheikh Zayed shut down the center in August 2003, saying that the think-tank &quot;had engaged in a discourse that starkly contradicted the principles of interfaith tolerance.&quot;

==Controversy and criticism==
The Anti-Defamation League alleges that the center regularly published anti-Semitic and conspiracy-theory literature, and promulgated anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism through its speakers and official publications.

According to the ADL website, speakers at the center have described Jews as &quot;enemies of all nations&quot; and &quot;cheaters whose greed knows no bounds.&quot; The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an infamous anti-Semitic forgery created in the 19th century to vilify Jews, was held up as a factual account of a Jewish plan to &quot;control the world.&quot; Speakers accused Israel of trying to sterilize Palestinian children by lacing the water &quot;used by some Palestinian schools&quot; with chemicals. Some Zayed speakers engaged in attempts to deny the Holocaust.

Speakers included Mr. Rami Tahbob, advisor to Al Quds&#x27; File on Arab Affairs, who claimed that Israel was trying to control the Palestinian population through the use of &quot;chemical drugs,&quot; according to the Zayed Center website; Michael Collins Piper, a Washington-based political writer and conspiracy theorist, who claimed the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are &quot;not a theory but a real fact,&quot; that Israel is developing an ethnic bomb that will kill only Arabs, and that the Mossad was responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Watergate scandal and the Monica Lewinsky affair; and Lyndon LaRouche, who spoke about global finance and his proposal for a transcontinental highway. The ADL reports that LaRouche also said that the September 11, 2001 attacks could not have happened without the &quot;connivance&quot; of highly placed U.S. officials, that Osama bin Laden &quot;could never have&quot; organized the attacks, and that the foreign policy of the U.S. has been purchased by &quot;Jewish gangsters&quot; and &quot;Christian Zionists.&quot; LaRouche opposed its closing down.

<doc id="560868" wikidata="Q59518343" url="?curid=560868" title="Duke of Southampton">
<text>Duke of Southampton is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1675 for Charles FitzRoy, an illegitimate son of King Charles II by his mistress, the 1st Duchess of Cleveland. Together with the dukedom, Charles Fitzroy also received the subsidiary titles of &quot;Earl of Chichester&quot; and &quot;Baron Newbury&quot;.

Upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1709, the 1st Duke of Southampton succeeded to her hereditary peerages (the dukedom of Cleveland, earldom of Southampton and barony of Nonsuch). At his death in 1730, the titles passed to his son William. The 2nd Duke of Southampton died without issue, so the titles became extinct upon his death in 1774. 

==Dukes of Southampton (1675)==
* Charles FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Southampton, 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1662–1730)
* William FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Southampton, 3rd Duke of Cleveland (1698–1774)
