<text>Ghosts () is a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. It was written in Danish and published in 1881, and first staged in 1882 in Chicago, Illinois, US, performed in Danish. 

Like many of Ibsen&#x27;s plays, &quot;Ghosts&quot; is a scathing commentary on 19th-century morality. Because of its subject matter, which includes religion, venereal disease, incest, and euthanasia, it immediately generated strong controversy and negative criticism. 

Since then, the play has come to be considered a &quot;great play&quot; that historically holds a position of &quot;immense importance&quot;.
Theater critic Maurice Valency wrote in 1963, &quot;From the standpoint of modern tragedy &quot;Ghosts&quot; strikes off in a new direction... Regular tragedy dealt mainly with the unhappy consequences of breaking the moral code. &quot;Ghosts&quot;, on the contrary, deals with the consequences of not breaking it.&quot;

Ibsen disliked the English translator William Archer&#x27;s use of the word &quot;Ghosts&quot; as the play&#x27;s title, as the Danish or Norwegian would be more accurately translated as &quot;The Revenants&quot;, which literally means &quot;The Ones Who Return&quot;.

==Characters==
* Mrs. Helen Alving, a widow
* Oswald Alving, her son, a painter
* Pastor Manders, an old friend of Helen Alving
* Jacob Engstrand, a carpenter
* Regina Engstrand, Mrs. Alving&#x27;s maid and the purported daughter of Jacob Engstrand, but she is actually the late Captain Alving&#x27;s illegitimate child

==Plot==
Helen Alving is about to dedicate an orphanage, which she has built in memory of her late husband, Captain Alving. Despite her husband&#x27;s affairs, Mrs. Alving stayed with him to protect her son Oswald from the taint of scandal and for fear of being shunned by the community.

In the course of the play, she discovers that Oswald (whom she had sent away to avoid his being corrupted by his father) is suffering from syphilis, which she believes he inherited from his father. She also discovers that Oswald has fallen in love with her maid Regina Engstrand, who is revealed to be the illegitimate daughter of Captain Alving and is therefore Oswald&#x27;s half-sister.

A sub-plot involves a carpenter, Jacob Engstrand, who married Regina&#x27;s mother when she was already pregnant. He regards Regina as his own daughter. He is unaware, or pretends to be, that Captain Alving was Regina&#x27;s father. Having recently completed his work building Mrs. Alving&#x27;s orphanage, Engstrand announces his ambition to open a hostel for seafarers. He tries to persuade Regina to leave Mrs. Alving and help him run the hostel, but she refuses. The night before the orphanage is due to open, Engstrand asks Pastor Manders to hold a prayer-meeting there. Later that night, the orphanage burns down. Earlier, Manders had persuaded Mrs. Alving not to insure the orphanage, as to do so would imply a lack of faith in divine providence. Engstrand says the blaze was caused by Manders&#x27; carelessness with a candle and offers to take the blame, which Manders readily accepts. Manders in turn offers to support Engstrand&#x27;s hostel.

When Regina and Oswald&#x27;s sibling relationship is exposed, Regina departs, leaving Oswald in anguish. He asks his mother to help him avoid the late stages of syphilis with a fatal morphine overdose. She agrees, but only if it becomes necessary. The play concludes with Mrs. Alving having to confront the decision of whether or not to euthanize her son in accordance with his wishes.

==Inception==
As with his other plays, Henrik Ibsen wrote &quot;Ghosts&quot; in Danish, the common written language of Denmark and Norway at the time. The original title, in both Danish and Norwegian, is , which can be literally translated as &quot;again walkers&quot;, &quot;ones who return&quot;, or &quot;revenants&quot;. It has a double meaning of both &quot;ghosts&quot; and &quot;events that repeat themselves&quot; which the English title &quot;Ghosts&quot; fails to capture.

Ibsen wrote &quot;Ghosts&quot; during the autumn of 1881 and published it that December. As early as November 1880, when he was living in Rome, he had been meditating on a new play to follow &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. When he went to Sorrento, in the summer of 1881, he was hard at work upon it. He finished it by the end of November 1881 and published it in Copenhagen on 13 December 1881.

==Performance and reception==
===Reaction to the script===
&quot;Ghosts&quot; was published in Copenhagen on 13 December 1881 in an edition of 10,000 copies. It caused a firestorm of public outcry, and most of the 10,000 copies did not sell, which was financially a severe blow for Ibsen. A subsequent print run of the text was not published until 1894.

The play was initially sent to a number of Nordic theaters, including the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, the Nya Teatern and Dramaten in Stockholm, and the Christiania Theater, but all of them rejected the play. In the early 1880s, the play was generally rejected by all major European playhouses, including those in Norway. 

Upon the publication of the text, Ibsen&#x27;s contemporaries found the play shocking and indecent and disliked its frank treatment of the forbidden topic of venereal disease. At the time, the mere mention of venereal disease was scandalous, and to show that a person who followed society&#x27;s ideals of morality was at risk from her own husband was considered beyond the pale. According to Richard Eyre, &quot;There was an outcry of indignation against the attack on religion, the defence of free love, the mention of incest and syphilis.&quot;

===Premiere and subsequent 19th-century productions===
&quot;Ghosts&quot; premiered in May 1882 in the United States, produced in Danish for Scandinavian immigrants by a Danish-Norwegian cast in Chicago, at the Aurora Turner Hall.

The first performance in Sweden was at Helsingborg on 22 August 1883.

&quot;Ghosts&quot; was produced in Norway in October 1883, and it received good reviews.

It was produced independently in September 1889 at Berlin&#x27;s Die Freie Bühne.

The play achieved a single private London performance on 13 March 1891 at the Royalty Theatre, which was its English-language premiere. The issue of Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office censorship, because of the subject matter of illegitimate children and sexually transmitted disease, was avoided by the formation of a subscription-only Independent Theatre Society to produce the play. Its members included playwright George Bernard Shaw and authors Thomas Hardy and Henry James. The play was reviled in the press. In a typical review at the time, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; referred to it as &quot;Ibsen&#x27;s positively abominable play entitled &quot;Ghosts&quot;... An open drain: a loathsome sore unbandaged; a dirty act done publicly... A lazar house with all its doors and windows open ... Gross, almost putrid indecorum... Literary carrion... Crapulous stuff&quot;.

In 1898 when Ibsen was presented to King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, at a dinner in Ibsen&#x27;s honour, the King told Ibsen that &quot;Ghosts&quot; was not a good play. After a pause, Ibsen exploded, &quot;Your Majesty, I &quot;had&quot; to write &quot;Ghosts&quot;!&quot;

&quot;Ghosts&quot; had its first New York City production, and its first English-language production in the U.S., on Broadway on 5 January 1894 at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre. It was produced again in 1899 by the New York Independent Theatre with Mary Shaw as Mrs. Alving. 

Russian actress Alla Nazimova, with Paul Orleneff, gave a notable production of &quot;Ghosts&quot; in a small room on the Lower East Side in 1895–96. When Nazimova had been a student in Russia, she had wanted to &quot;play Regina for my graduation piece at the dramatic school at Moscow, but they would not let me. &quot;Ghosts&quot; was at that time prohibited by the censor, because it reflects on the Church.&quot;

===20th- and 21st-century productions===
The play later received many European performances. In its 1906 production in Berlin, the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch was commissioned to create the original stage designs.

On 4 May 1962, the play was performed in the Theatre Sala Chopin in Mexico City with Mexican actress and Hollywood star Dolores del Río in the role of Mrs. Alving.

A Broadway revival of &quot;Ghosts&quot; ran from 30 August to 2 October 1982 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater in New York City, and starred Kevin Spacey as Oswald in his Broadway debut. The cast included Edward Binns, John Neville (who also directed the production) as Pastor Manders, Liv Ullmann as Mrs. Alving, and Jane Murray as Regina. The production opened originally at the Eisenhower Theater in Washington&#x27;s Kennedy Center on July 19, 1982.

A touring UK production, designed by Simon Higlett and inspired by Edvard Munch&#x27;s original stage designs for a 1906 staging in Berlin, began performances at Rose Theatre Kingston in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2013, prior to an official opening on 25 September. Directed by Stephen Unwin, the cast included Patrick Drury as Pastor Manders, Florence Hall as Regina, Kelly Hunter as Mrs Alving, and Mark Quartley as Oswald.

An award-winning 2013–14 London production opened at the Almeida Theatre on 26 September 2013 and transferred to the West End at Trafalgar Studios on 9 December, running through 22 March 2014. Adapted and directed by Richard Eyre, it featured Lesley Manville, Jack Lowden, Will Keen, Charlene McKenna, and Brian McCardie. Manville and Lowden won Olivier Awards for their performances; Manville also won the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Actress, and Lowden also won the Ian Charleson Award. Eyre won the Evening Standard Award for Best Director. The production also won the Olivier Award for Best Revival, and received Olivier Award nominations for Best Director and Best Lighting Design. A filmed February 2014 performance of the production screened in more than 275 UK and Irish cinemas on 26 June 2014. The entire filmed performance can be viewed online. The production was also adapted for radio by director Richard Eyre, broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 15 December 2013 and re-broadcast on 26 April 2015. Eyre&#x27;s production was presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Spring 2015, where Ben Brantley in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;possibly the best &quot;Ghosts&quot; you&#x27;ll ever see&quot;.

In 2014 a Chinese-Norwegian co-production entitled &quot;Ghosts 2.0&quot; was produced in Beijing, commissioned by Ibsen International and directed by Wang Chong, who had started the Chinese New Wave Theater Movement. The multimedia performance used four cameras on the stage, giving the audience different perspectives.

==Film and television==

&quot;Ghosts&quot; has been filmed, and adapted for film and television, numerous times in various languages. It was adapted at least three times for silent films. In 1915, George Nichols directed a film of the same name for producer D. W. Griffith. Mary Alden and Henry B. Walthall starred. Also in 1915, it was filmed in Russia, directed and adapted by Vladimir Gardin. In 1918, the Italian production company Milano Films released an adaptation titled &quot;&quot;, starring Ermete Zacconi and his wife .

In 1987 it was televised on the BBC, directed by Elijah Moshinsky and featuring Judi Dench as Mrs. Alving, Kenneth Branagh as Oswald, Michael Gambon as Pastor Manders, and Natasha Richardson as Regina. In 2014 Richard Eyre&#x27;s award-winning London stage adaptation starring Lesley Manville and Jack Lowden was filmed and screened at numerous cinemas, and is available to view online.

<text>The Further Education and Training Awards Council () or FETAC was a statutory qualification-awarding body for further education in Ireland. It was established on 11 June 2001 under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999. FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.

FETAC was the successor to the National Council for Vocational Awards (NCVA) and also made awards previously made by Fáilte Ireland – National Tourism Development Authority (previously Bord Fáilte and CERT, the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training), FÁS – Training and Employment Authority, National Council for Educational Awards (Foundation Certificate only) and Teagasc – Agriculture and Food Development Authority.

As well as making awards, FETAC validated, monitored and ensured the quality of teaching programmes, and determined standards.

FETAC did not deliver education and training programmes itself; they were delivered by a number of bodies in both the public and private sectors. Examples of teaching bodies in the public sector were Bord Iascaigh Mhara, CERT, FÁS, Teagasc, the Vocational Education Committees and Institutes of Technology.

Awards granted by FETAC were included in the ten-level National Framework of Qualifications established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. FETAC awards fell into levels 1 – 6 of the framework.

<doc id="555597" wikidata="Q6875309" url="?curid=555597" title="Misdirection (magic)">
<text>In theatrical magic, misdirection is a form of deception in which the performer draws audience attention to one thing to distract it from another. Managing audience attention is the aim of all theater, and the foremost requirement of all magic acts. Whether the magic is of a &quot;pocket trick&quot; variety or a large stage production, misdirection is the central secret. The term describes either the effect (the observer&#x27;s focus on an unimportant object) or the sleight of hand or patter (the magician&#x27;s speech) that creates it.

It is difficult to say who first coined the term, but an early reference to misdirection appears in the writing of an influential performer and writer, Nevil Maskelyne: &quot;It consists admittedly in misleading the spectator&#x27;s &quot;senses,&quot; in order to screen from detection certain details for which secrecy is required.&quot; Around the same time, magician, artist and author Harlan Tarbell noted, &quot;Nearly the whole art of sleight of hand depends on this art of misdirection.&quot;

Henry Hay describes the central act of conjuring as &quot;a manipulation of interest.&quot;

Magicians misdirect audience attention in two basic ways. One leads the audience to look away for a fleeting moment, so that they don&#x27;t detect some sleight or move. The other approach re-frames the audience&#x27;s perception, distracting them into thinking that an extraneous factor has much to do with the accomplishment of the feat when it really has no bearing on the effect at all. Dariel Fitzkee notes that &quot;The true skill of the magician is in the skill he exhibits in influencing the spectators mind.&quot; Additionally, sometimes a prop such as a &quot;magic wand&quot; aids in misdirection.

==Use==

In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians&quot;, author T.A. Waters writes that &quot;Misdirection is the cornerstone of nearly all successful magic; without it, even the most skilled Sleight of Hand or mechanical device is unlikely to create an illusion of real magic.&quot; Misdirection uses the limits of the human mind to give the wrong picture and memory. The mind of a typical audience member can only concentrate on one thing at a time. The magician uses this to manipulate the audience&#x27;s ideas or perceptions of sensory input, leading them to false conclusions.

The performer can direct the audience&#x27;s attention in various ways. In the book, &quot;The Secret Art of Magic&quot;, authors Eric Evans and Nowlin Craver posit that magic is directly related to warfare, and relies on the same principles for success. They reference Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot; to show how deception is essential to any successful campaign. Craver goes on to illustrate, through the 36 strategies, how they form a blueprint for every known method of misdirection. In World War II, British military intelligence employed stage magician Jasper Maskelyne to help devise various forms of misdirection such as ruses, deception, and camouflage.

Magicians who have researched and evolved misdirection techniques include Max Malini, John Ramsay, Tommy Wonder, Derren Brown, Juan Tamariz, Tony Slydini, and Dai Vernon.

==Definitions==

In his 1948 book, &quot;Principles and Deceptions&quot;, Arthur Buckley questions the accuracy of the term. Since that time, magicians have debated use of the term &quot;misdirection&quot;, creating a great deal of discussion about what it is and how it works. Buckley drew a distinction between &quot;misdirection&quot; and &quot;direction&quot;. One being a negative term, and the other positive. Ultimately, he equates the two as the same thing: &quot;If a performer by some means has directed the thoughts of his audience to the conclusion that he has done something which he has not done, he has wrongly directed them into this belief, hence, misdirection.&quot;

Jacobus Maria Bemelman, under the stage name Tommy Wonder, has pointed out that it is much more effective, from the magician&#x27;s point of view, to concentrate on the positive aim of &quot;directing&quot; the audience&#x27;s attention. He writes that &quot;&quot;Mis&quot;direction implies &#x27;wrong&#x27; direction. It suggests that attention is directed away from something. By constantly using this term, it eventually becomes so ingrained in our minds that we might start to perceive misdirection as directing attention away from rather than toward something.&quot;

In his October-November 2019 United States &quot;Slydini Inspiration&quot; lecture tour, Tony Slydini protege&#x27; Bill Wisch combined two definitions of Tony Slydini&#x27;s into one coherent one. Bill explained that when he asked Slydini &quot;What is misdirection?&quot;, Slydini would repeat &quot;if you believe it, they&#x27;ll believe it&quot; and &quot;magic is something they don&#x27;t see.&quot; Bill&#x27;s combined definition: &quot;Misdirection is true when they believe what you do and then follow you.&quot;

<doc id="555604" wikidata="Q956249" url="?curid=555604" title="Warren Jeffs">
<text>Warren Steed Jeffs (born December 3, 1955) is an American cult leader who is serving a life sentence in Texas for child sexual assault following two convictions in 2011. He is the president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a polygamous cult based in Arizona. The FLDS Church was founded in the early-20th century when its founders deemed the renunciation of polygamy by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to be apostate. The LDS Church disavows any relation between it and the FLDS Church, although there are significant historical ties.

In 2006, Jeffs was placed on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List for his flight from the charges that he had arranged illegal child marriages between his adult male followers and underage girls in Utah. In 2007, Arizona charged him with eight additional counts in two separate cases, including incest and sexual conduct with minors.

In September 2007, Jeffs was convicted of two counts of rape as an accomplice, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years to life in Utah State Prison. This conviction was overturned by the Utah Supreme Court in 2010 due to flawed jury instructions.

Jeffs was extradited to Texas, where he was found guilty of sexual assault of a minor, for raping a 15-year-old child bride; and aggravated sexual assault against a child, for raping a 12-year-old child bride; for which he was sentenced to life in prison, plus twenty years, and fined $10,000. Jeffs is incarcerated at the Louis C. Powledge Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice near Palestine, Texas.

==Family and early life==
Warren Steed Jeffs was born in Sacramento, California on December 3, 1955, to Rulon Jeffs (1909–2002) and Merilyn Steed (born circa 1935, a descendent of pioneer Thomas Joseph Steed). Warren was born more than two months prematurely. Warren grew up outside of Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1976, the year he turned 21, Warren Jeffs became principal of Alta Academy, an FLDS private school at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon. He served as school principal for twenty years and was known for being &quot;a for the rules and for discipline.&quot; Warren&#x27;s father Rulon Jeffs became the President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) in 1986 and had nineteen or twenty wives and approximately 60 children. Warren went on to have, according to former church members, 78 wives.

==Church leadership==
Prior to his father&#x27;s death in 2002, Jeffs held the position of counselor to the church leader. Jeffs became Rulon&#x27;s successor with his official title in the FLDS Church becoming &quot;President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator&quot; as well as &quot;President of the Priesthood&quot;. The Revelator was the head of the organization of all adult male church members who were deemed worthy to hold the priesthood, a tradition carried on in the Latter Day Saint movement.

The death of Rulon and Jeffs&#x27;s ascension to the leadership position caused a split in the FLDS Church between Jeffs&#x27;s followers and the followers of Winston Blackmore, the long-time bishop of the Bountiful, British Columbia group of the FLDS Church. More than half of the Canadian branch members left the FLDS Church to stay with Blackmore as their leader, and Jeffs excommunicated Blackmore in September 2002.

Following Rulon&#x27;s death, Jeffs told the high-ranking FLDS officials, &quot;I won&#x27;t say much, but I will say thishands off my father&#x27;s wives.&quot; When addressing his father&#x27;s widows he said, &quot;You women will live as if Father is still alive and in the next room.&quot; Within a week he had married all but two of his father&#x27;s wives; one refused to marry Jeffs and was subsequently prohibited from ever marrying again, while the other, Rebecca Wall, fled the FLDS compound. Naomi Jessop, one of the first of Rulon&#x27;s former wives to marry Jeffs, subsequently became his favorite wife and confidant. As the sole individual in the FLDS Church with the authority to perform marriages, Jeffs was responsible for assigning wives to husbands. He also had the authority to discipline male church members by &quot;reassigning their wives, children and homes to another man.&quot;

Until courts in Utah intervened, Jeffs controlled almost all of the land in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, which was part of a church trust called the United Effort Plan (UEP). The land has been estimated to be worth over $100 million. All UEP assets were put in the custody of the Utah court system pending further litigation. As the result of a November 2012 court decision, much of the UEP land is to be sold to those who live on it.

In January 2004, Jeffs expelled a group of twenty men from the Short Creek Community, including the mayor, and reassigned their wives and children to other men in the community. Jeffs, like his predecessors, continued the standard FLDS and Mormon fundamentalist tenet that faithful men must follow what is known as the doctrine of plural marriage in order to attain exaltation in the afterlife. Jeffs specifically taught that a devoted church member is expected to have at least three wives in order to get into heaven, and the more wives a man has, the closer he is to heaven.

===Changes in location and leadership===
Before his 2006 arrest, Jeffs had last been seen on January 1, 2005, near Eldorado, Texas, at the dedication ceremony of the foundation of a large FLDS temple on the YFZ Ranch. The ranch came into the public eye on April 7, 2008, when Texas authorities conducted a raid and took legal custody of 416 children, in response to a March 31 phone call alleging physical and sexual abuse on the ranch. The caller claimed to be a 16-year-old girl married to a 50-year-old man, and stated that she had given birth to his child a year prior. Residents, however, told authorities that there was in fact no such girl, and the calls were ultimately traced to 33-year-old Rozita Swinton, totally unconnected to the FLDS Church, and known for repeated instances of filing false reports. Nevertheless, Texas authorities continued to investigate whether Swinton&#x27;s claims were a hoax. The women and children who were suspected of being minors were returned after Texas courts established that the state had not presented sufficient evidence of abuse to have removed them.

On June 10, 2006, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard told the &quot;Deseret News&quot; that he had heard from several sources that Jeffs had returned to Arizona, and had performed marriage ceremonies in a mobile home that was being used as a wedding chapel.

On March 27, 2007, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; reported that Jeffs had renounced his role as prophet of the FLDS Church in a conversation with his brother Nephi. Nephi quoted him as saying he was &quot;the greatest of all sinners&quot; and that God had never called him to be a prophet. Jeffs presented a handwritten note to the judge at the end of trial on March 27, saying that he was not a prophet of the FLDS Church. On November 7, the Washington County, Utah, Attorney&#x27;s Office released video of jailhouse conversations between Nephi and Jeffs, in which Jeffs renounces his prophethood, claiming that God had told him that if he revealed that he was not the rightful prophet, and was a &quot;wicked man&quot;, he would still gain a place in the celestial kingdom. Jeffs also admits to what he calls &quot;immoral actions with a sister and a daughter&quot; when he was 20 years old. Other records show that while incarcerated, Jeffs tried to kill himself by banging his head against the walls and trying to hang himself.

Jeffs formally resigned as President of the FLDS Church effective November 20, 2007. In an email to the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, Jeffs&#x27;s attorneys made the following statements: &quot;Mr. Jeffs has asked that the following statement be released to the media and to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints: Mr. Jeffs resigned as President of the Corporation of the President of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Inc.&quot; The statement did not address his ecclesiastical position as prophet of the FLDS Church, and many in the FLDS communities still regard him as the prophet and their current leader. There are also reports that Jeffs admitted his position of prophet in the FLDS Church was a usurpation in a conversation to his brother, and declared that &quot;Brother William E. Jessop has been the prophet since [my] Father&#x27;s passing&quot;, though Jeffs&#x27;s attorneys have claimed he misspoke. In early 2011, Jeffs retook legal control of the denomination.

==Convictions for sex crimes==
===Allegations and fugitive from justice===
In July 2004, Jeffs&#x27;s nephew, Brent Jeffs, filed a lawsuit alleging that Jeffs had raped him in the FLDS Church&#x27;s Salt Lake Valley compound in the late 1980s. Together with author Maia Szalavitz, Brent wrote the memoir &quot;Lost Boy,&quot; which recounts alleged incidents of child sexual abuse inflicted upon him by Jeffs, his brothers, and other family members, committed when Brent was aged 5 or 6. Brent&#x27;s brother Clayne committed suicide after accusing Jeffs of sexually assaulting him as a child. Two of Jeffs&#x27;s nephews and two of Jeffs&#x27;s own children have also publicly claimed to have been sexually abused by him.

In June 2005, Jeffs was charged in Mohave County, Arizona, with sexual assault on a minor and with conspiracy to commit sexual misconduct with a minor for allegedly arranging, in April 2001, a marriage between a then-14-year-old girl and her 19-year-old first cousin, Allen. The young girl, Elissa Wall (then known as &quot;Jane Doe IV,&quot; and the younger sister of Rebecca Wall), testified that she begged Rulon Jeffs to let her wait until she was older or choose another man for her. The elder Jeffs was apparently &quot;sympathetic,&quot; but his son was not, and she was forced to go through with the marriage. Wall alleged that Allen often raped her and that she repeatedly miscarried. She eventually left Allen and the community.

In July 2005, the Arizona Attorney General&#x27;s office distributed wanted posters offering $10,000 for information leading to Jeffs&#x27;s arrest and conviction. On October 28, Jeffs&#x27;s brother Seth was arrested under suspicion of harboring a fugitive. During a routine traffic stop in Pueblo County, Colorado, police found nearly $142,000 in cash, $7,000 worth of prepaid debit cards and personal records. During Seth&#x27;s court case, FBI Agent Andrew Stearns testified that Seth had told him that he did not know where his older brother was and that he would not reveal his whereabouts if he did. Seth was convicted of harboring a fugitive on May 1, 2006. On July 14, he was sentenced to three years probation and a $2,500 fine.

On April 5, 2006, Utah issued an arrest warrant for Jeffs on felony charges of accomplice rape of a teenage girl between 14 and 18 years old. Shortly after, on May 6, the FBI placed Jeffs on its Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, offering a $60,000 reward. He was the 482nd fugitive placed on the list. The reward was soon raised to $100,000, and the public was warned that &quot;Jeffs may travel with a number of loyal and armed bodyguards.&quot;

On June 8, 2006, Jeffs returned to Colorado City to perform more &quot;child-bride marriages.&quot; On May 27, 2008, &quot;The Smoking Gun&quot; website released images of Jeffs with two underage wives, one of whom was 12 years old, celebrating first wedding anniversaries in 2005 and 2006.

===Arrest, trial and convictions===
On August 28, 2006, around 9 p.m. PDT, Jeffs was pulled over on Interstate 15 in Clark County, Nevada, by highway trooper Eddie Dutchover because the temporary license plates on his red 2007 Cadillac Escalade were not visible. One of Jeffs&#x27;s wives, Naomi Jessop, and his brother Isaac were with him. Jeffs possessed four computers, sixteen cell phones, disguises (including three wigs and twelve pairs of sunglasses), and more than $55,000 in cash. Jeffs&#x27;s wife and brother were questioned and released.

In a Nevada court hearing on August 31, Jeffs waived any challenge to extradition and agreed to be returned to Utah to face two first-degree felony charges of accomplice rape. Each charge carries an indeterminate penalty of five years to life in prison. Arizona prosecutors were next in line to try Jeffs. He was held in the Washington County jail, pending an April 23, 2007 trial on two counts of rape, as an accomplice for his role in arranging the marriage between Elissa Wall and her first cousin.

Jeffs was believed to be leading his group from jail and a Utah state board has expressed dissatisfaction in dealing with Hildale police, believing that many members of the force had ties to Jeffs, and thus did not cooperate. In May and July 2007, Jeffs was indicted in Arizona on eight counts, including sexual misconduct with a minor and incest.

Jeffs&#x27;s trial began on September 11, 2007, in St. George, Utah, with Judge James L. Shumate presiding. Jeffs was housed in Utah&#x27;s Purgatory Correctional Facility in solitary confinement for the duration. At the culmination of the trial, on September 25, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape. He was sentenced to prison for ten years to life and began serving his sentence at the Utah State Prison. On July 27, 2010, the Utah Supreme Court, citing deficient jury instructions, reversed Jeffs&#x27;s convictions and ordered a new trial. The court found that the trial judge should have told the jury that Jeffs could not be convicted unless it could be proved that he intended for Elissa&#x27;s husband to engage in nonconsensual sex with her. Elissa subsequently wrote an autobiography on her experiences in the FLDS Church and with Jeffs entitled &quot;Stolen Innocence.&quot; The book was co-authored with former &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Lisa Pulitzer.

Jeffs was also scheduled to be tried in Arizona. He had entered a not-guilty plea on February 27, 2008, to sex charges stemming from the arranged marriages of three teenaged girls to older men. He was transported to the Mohave County jail to await trial. On June 9, 2010, a state judge, at the request of Mohave County prosecutor Matt Smith, dismissed all charges with prejudice. Smith said that the Arizona victims no longer wanted to testify and that Jeffs had spent almost two years in jail awaiting trial, more than he would have received had he been convicted. Combined with the pending charges against Jeffs in Texas, Smith concluded that &quot;it would be impractical and unnecessary&quot; to try Jeffs in Arizona. Jeffs was then returned to Utah; at the time, his appeal of the 2007 conviction was still pending.

On August 9, 2011, Jeffs was convicted in Texas on two counts of sexual assault of a child and sentenced to life in prison. He will be eligible for parole on July 22, 2038.

===Incarceration===
Jeffs tried to hang himself in jail in 2007 in Utah. On July 9, 2008, he was taken from the Mohave County, Arizona jail in Kingman, Arizona, to a Las Vegas, Nevada, hospital for what was described as a serious medical problem. Sheriff Tom Sheahan did not specify the problem, but said it was serious enough to move him about 100 miles from the Kingman Regional Medical Center to the Nevada hospital.

Jeffs has engaged in lengthy hunger strikes, which his doctors and attorneys have claimed were for spiritual reasons. In August 2009, Superior Court Judge Steve Conn ordered that Jeffs be force-fed at the Arizona jail.

On August 29, 2011, Jeffs was taken to East Texas Medical Center, Tyler, Texas, and hospitalized in critical condition under a medically induced coma after excessive fasting. Officials were not sure how long he would remain hospitalized, but expected Jeffs to live. Jeffs is incarcerated at the Louis C. Powledge Unit of the TDCJ near Palestine, Texas.

Jeffs predicted in December 2012 that the world would end before 2013 and called for his followers to prepare for the end.

In 2012, while incarcerated at the Powledge Unit, Jeffs released a book titled &quot;Jesus Christ Message to All Nations&quot; compiling various revelations that he stated he had received. Among these were directives to set Jeffs free and warnings to specific countries around the world. Copies of the book were mailed to Utah state legislators by the FLDS Church. Federal prosecutors stated in 2016 that the publication had been financed by $250,000 in money defrauded from federal welfare programs and laundered through FLDS shops.

The United Effort Plan (UEP) trust that formerly belonged to the FLDS was taken over by Utah in 2005 and controlled by the court for over a decade, before a judge handed it over to a community board mostly composed of former sect members. In 2017, both the trust and Jeffs were sued by a woman alleging she was sexually abused by Jeffs when she was a child. Jeffs allegedly suffered a mental breakdown in the summer of 2019, leaving him unfit to give a deposition in the sex abuse case against him. Attorneys representing the UEP community trust contended that forcing him to testify would be &quot;futile.&quot; The plaintiff&#x27;s attorney said there is a lack of evidence to support a claim of Jeff&#x27;s incompetency, accusing the trust of being &quot;understandably very fearful&quot; about Jeffs&#x27;s testimony since it is liable for his actions as the past president of the FLDS.

Current FLDS members continue to consider Jeffs to be their leader and prophet who speaks to God and who has been wrongly convicted.

==Views==

Jeffs condemned same-sex marriage as being as evil as murder. Jeffs has also condemned interracial marriage and described Black people as being used by the devil for evil, as detailed in 2005 by the Southern Poverty Law Center&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;.

While in prison, Jeffs has made several end times predictions.

<doc id="555605" wikidata="Q459555" url="?curid=555605" title="Irish presidential election">
<text>The Irish presidential election determines who serves as the President of Ireland, the head of state of Ireland. The last election took place on 26 October 2018. Where only one candidate is nominated, that candidate is declared elected without a ballot; this has occurred on six occasions.

==Procedure==
Presidential elections are conducted in line with Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland and under the Presidential Elections Act 1993, as amended. An election is ordinarily held not more than 60 days before the scheduled ending of the incumbent&#x27;s seven-year term of office. In case of a casual vacancy (by death, resignation or removal from office) an election is held within 60 days. The dates during which candidates may be nominated and the date of the election are fixed by an order made by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

All Irish citizens may vote in presidential elections if they have the right to vote in elections to Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas or parliament). The voting age is eighteen. The Dáil electoral register is based on residency within a geographical Dáil constituency, so that those living abroad may not vote, except diplomats and military posted overseas. Resident UK citizens may vote in Dáil elections but not presidential elections. A proposed constitutional amendment would give non-resident citizens a vote in presidential elections.

Elections are conducted by means of the instant-runoff voting, which is the single-winner analogue of the single transferable vote used in other Irish elections. The constitution calls the system &quot;proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote&quot;, although a single-seat election cannot be proportional.

To qualify, candidates must:
*be a citizen of Ireland,
*be at least 35 years of age, and
*be nominated by:
**at least twenty members of the Houses of the Oireachtas (, 160 TDs and 60 senators), or
**at least four of the 31 county or city Councils, or
**him- or herself, in the case of an incumbent or former president who has served one term.

The election order will declare the last day on which nominations may be received. If a member of the Oireachtas or a County or City council nominate more than one candidate, only the first nomination paper received from them will be deemed valid.

If there is only a single candidate they will be deemed elected without a poll. No one may serve as President for more than two terms.

==Spending limits and donations==
The spending limits in a Presidential election were reduced in 2011. The limit is €750,000 (was €1.3 million) and the amount a candidate can be reimbursed from the State is €200,000 (was €260,000). A candidate who is elected or who receives in excess of one quarter of the quota can seek reimbursement of their expenses.

The value of donations that may be accepted by candidates, their election agents and third parties at a presidential election is governed by law. In the case of candidates and presidential election agents, the maximum donation that may be accepted from a person (or a body) in a particular year cannot exceed €2,539. In the case of a third party, the maximum donation that may be accepted cannot exceed €6,348. The acceptance of donations from non-Irish citizens residing abroad is prohibited.

<text>Harriet Stratemeyer Adams (December 12, 1892 – March 27, 1982) was an American juvenile book packager, children&#x27;s novelist, and publisher who was responsible for some 200 books over her literary career. She wrote the plot outlines for many books in the Nancy Drew series, using characters invented by her father, Edward Stratemeyer. Adams also oversaw other ghostwriters who wrote for these and many other series as a part of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, and oversaw the rewriting of many of the novels to update them starting in the late 1950s.

==Stratemeyer Syndicate==
With her sister, Edna, Adams took over control of the Stratemeyer Syndicate after her father Edward Stratemeyer&#x27;s death in 1930. Edna ran the daily business operations, while Adams dealt with publishers and wrote; Edna became inactive when she married in 1942, and Adams took over the business. Adams is credited with keeping the Syndicate afloat through the Great Depression, and with revising the two most popular series, Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, in the 1950s and 1960s, removing stereotypes and streamlining plots and characters. She ran the Syndicate for 52 years.

==Role in Nancy Drew series==
The extremely popular Nancy Drew books were the brainchild of Adams&#x27;s father, who created the characters of a sixteen-year-old sleuth, her lawyer father, and their housekeeper. Later, Nancy&#x27;s age was increased to eighteen to give her more independence. Adams came up with plot ideas and hired ghostwriters to flesh them out. The best-known books were written primarily by Mildred Wirt Benson, all published under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Adams outlined a few in the Hardy Boys series, which were published under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. Although Adams claimed to write all the Nancy Drew books entirely by herself during her lifetime, it is well established that Wirt and 28 other authors did the actual writing, following Adams&#x27;s ideas and embellishing on them. Adams touched up the completed manuscripts.

==Personal life==
Harriet Stratemeyer was born in Newark, New Jersey, on December 12, 1892, the daughter of Edward Stratemeyer and Magdalena Van Camp. At a young age, Adams wanted to break free from being a &quot;proper, young lady who should stay at home&quot;. She climbed trees, made friends with local boys, and loved books from an early age. Adams graduated from Wellesley College in 1914. Her father forbade her to work outside the estate, so she edited manuscripts at home. In 1915, she married Russell Vroom Adams, and raised four children, becoming involved in the family business only after her father&#x27;s death. She resided in Maplewood, New Jersey, and in Pottersville, New Jersey, an area within Tewksbury Township. 
She lived in Pottersville at her estate, Bird Haven New Jersey and died of a heart attack while watching &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; for the first time.

Adams was interred in the Stratemeyer crypt in Fairmount Cemetery in Newark.

<text>Andrew Bell (1726–1809) was a Scottish engraver and printer, who co-founded &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; with Colin Macfarquhar.

==Biography==

Bell was born in Edinburgh in 1726, his father a baker. He had little formal education and was apprenticed to the engraver Richard Cooper. Bell was a colourful Scot. His height was ; he had crooked legs and an enormous nose that he would sometimes augment with a papier-mache version whenever anyone stared at his natural nose. Bell began work as an engraver of crests, names, etc. on dog collars. Despite his small stature, he deliberately rode the tallest horse available in Edinburgh, dismounting by a ladder to the cheers of onlookers.

Bell produced almost all of the copperplate engravings for the 1st–4th editions of the &quot;Britannica&quot;: 160 for the 1st, 340 for the 2nd, 542 for the 3rd, and 531 for the 4th. By contrast, the 50 plates of the Supplement to the 3rd edition were engraved by D.Lizars. 

After Macfarquhar died in 1793, Bell bought out his heirs and became sole owner of the &quot;Britannica&quot; until his own death in 1809. He quarrelled with his son-in-law, Thomson Bonar, and refused to speak with him for the last ten years of his life.

==Family==

He married Anne Wake who was the daughter of an excise officer in 1756. She was apparently the granddaughter of the artist John Scougal and through this connection Bell inherited many of Scougal&#x27;s paintings.

<text>In music, development is a process by which a musical idea is transformed and restated in the course of a composition. Certain central ideas are repeated in different contexts or in altered form so that the listener can consciously or unconsciously compare the various statements of the idea, often in surprising or ironic manners. This practice has its roots in counterpoint, where a theme or subject might create an impression of a pleasing or affective sort, but delight the mind further as its contrapuntal capabilities are gradually unveiled.

Development is often contrasted with musical variation, which is a slightly different means to the same end. Development is carried out upon portions of material treated in &quot;many&quot; different presentations and combinations at a time, while variation depends upon &quot;one&quot; type of presentation at a time.

The development is the middle section of the sonata form, between the exposition and the recapitulation; in some older texts, this section may be referred to as &quot;free fantasia&quot;.

== Methods of development ==

According to the &quot;Oxford Companion to Music&quot; there are several ways of developing a theme. These include:

* The division of a theme into parts, each of which can be developed in any of the above ways or recombined in a new way. Similarly, two or more themes can be developed in combination; in some cases, themes are composed with this possibility in mind.
* Alteration of pitch intervals while retaining the original rhythm.
* Rhythmic displacement, so that the metrical stress occurs at a different point in the otherwise unchanged theme.
* Sequence, either diatonically within a key or through a succession of keys.

The Scherzo movement from Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 15 in D major, Op 28 (the &quot;Pastoral&quot; Sonata) shows a number of these processes at work on a small scale. Charles Rosen (2002) marvels at the simplicity of the musical material: &quot;The opening theme consists of nothing but four F sharps in descending octaves, followed by a light and simple I/ii/V7/I cadence with a quirky motif repeated four times.&quot; These opening eight bars provide all the material Beethoven needs to furnish his development, which takes place in bars 33-48: 

=== The division of a theme into parts ===

The falling octave in the first two bars and the repeated staccato chord in the left hand in bars 5-8 are the two fragments that Beethoven later develops:

=== Alteration of pitch intervals ===

The somewhat bald falling octave idea in the first four bars is transformed in bars 33-36 into an elegant shape ending with an upward-curving semitone:

=== Rhythmic displacement ===
In this movement, the repeated left hand chords in bar 5 are displaced so that in bar 33 onwards, they fall on the 2nd and 3rd beats:

=== Sequence and the development of two or more themes in combination ===

In bars 33-48, the two fragments combine and the development goes through a modulating sequence that touches on a succession of keys; The following outline demonstrates Beethoven’s strategic planning, which he applied on a larger scale in the development sections of some of his major works. The bass line traces a decisive progression through a rising chromatic scale:
To quote Rosen again, writing à propos of this movement: &quot;As Beethoven&#x27;s contemporary, the painter John Constable, said, making something out of nothing is the true work of the artist.&quot;

== Development on a larger scale ==

Not all development takes place in what is commonly known as the &quot;development section&quot; of a work. It can take place at any point in the musical argument. For instance, the “immensely energetic sonata movement” that forms the main body of the overture to Mozart’s Opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; announces the following theme during the initial exposition. It consists of two contrasting phrases: “first determined, then soft and conspiratorial.”

William Mann says “the first, insistent phrase [of the above] is very important. At once it is taken up imitatively by various departments of the orchestra, and [starting in] A major, jumps through several related keys.” Each repetition of the descending phrase is subtly altered one note at a time, causing the music to pass from the key of A major, through A minor and thence via a chord of G7 to the remote key of C major, and thence back to A major.

The central section of the Overture (the part commonly known as the &quot;development section&quot;) utilizes both phrases of the theme “in new juxtapositions and new tonalities,” developing it through repetition in a modulating sequence. The steady plod of the bass line against the sequential repetitions of the “soft and conspiratorial” phrase outlines a circle of fifths chord progression:

Simultaneously, Mozart adds to the mix and continues to develop the imitative counterpoint that grew out of the first phrase. In the words of Willam Mann, this development “unites both halves” of the theme. This is how this tightly woven texture pans out:

<text>Famke Beumer Janssen (; born 5 November 1964) is a Dutch actress and former model. She played Xenia Onatopp in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995), Jean Grey / Phoenix in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series (2000–2014), and Lenore Mills in the &quot;Taken&quot; film trilogy (2008–2014). In 2008, she was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for Integrity by the United Nations. She made her directorial debut with &quot;Bringing Up Bobby&quot; in 2011. She is also known for her roles in the Netflix original series &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot; (2013–2015), FX&#x27;s &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2003–2010), and ABC&#x27;s &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; (2014–2020). Janssen starred in the 2017 NBC crime thriller &quot;The Blacklist: Redemption&quot;.

== Early life==
Famke Beumer Janssen was born on November 5, 1964, in Amstelveen, the Netherlands. She has two sisters, director Antoinette Beumer and actress Marjolein Beumer, both of whom changed their surnames to Beumer after their parents divorced.

In addition to her native Dutch, Janssen speaks English and French. She learned German, but has not kept up with it. Following her high school graduation, Janssen studied economics for a year at the University of Amsterdam, which she later called &quot;the stupidest idea I ever had.&quot; In the early 1990s, she enrolled at Columbia University&#x27;s School of General Studies to study creative writing and literature.

== Career ==
In 1984, Janssen moved to the United States to begin her professional career as a fashion model. She signed with Elite Model Management and worked for Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, Chanel, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret. She starred in a 1988 commercial for the perfume Exclamation by Coty. Her looks have been compared to 1940s movie stars like Hedy Lamarr.

After retiring from modelling in the early 1990s, Janssen had guest roles on several television series, including a starring role in the 1992 &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot;, as empathic metamorph Kamala, opposite Patrick Stewart, with whom she later starred in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series. That same year, Janssen was offered the role of Jadzia Dax in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, but turned it down to pursue film roles. Her first film role was alongside Jeff Goldblum in the 1992 crime drama film &quot;Fathers &amp; Sons&quot;.

In 1995, Janssen appeared in Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s debut James Bond film, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, as &quot;femme fatale&quot; Xenia Onatopp. She appeared in &quot;Lord of Illusions&quot; with Scott Bakula. In an attempt to fight against typecasting after her Bond girl performance, Janssen began seeking out more intriguing support roles, appearing in John Irvin&#x27;s &quot;City of Industry&quot;, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity&quot;, Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;, and Ted Demme&#x27;s &quot;Monument Ave.&quot; Denis Leary, her co-star in &quot;Monument Ave.&quot;, was impressed by how easily she blended in, initially not recognizing her, as she was already in character. In the late 1990s, she appeared in &quot;The Faculty&quot;, &quot;Rounders&quot;, &quot;Deep Rising&quot;, and &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;.

In 2000, Janssen played superhero Dr. Jean Grey in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;X-Men&quot;. She later reprised the role in the 2003 sequel, &quot;X2&quot;, where her character shows signs of increasing powers, but at the end of the film, she is presumably killed. Janssen returns as Jean, whose death in &quot;X2&quot; awoke her dark alternate personality, Phoenix, in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006). For that role, she won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She returned as Jean in the 2013 film &quot;The Wolverine&quot; as a hallucination of Wolverine, followed by a brief cameo for &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014).

In 2002, Janssen landed the role of villainess Serleena in &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, but had to abandon the film due to a death in her family and was replaced by Lara Flynn Boyle. Janssen had a prominent role in the second season of the TV series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, as the seductive and manipulative life coach Ava Moore, which earned her Hollywood Life&#x27;s Breakthrough Artist of the Year Award. She reprised her role in the final two episodes of the series.

In 2007, she starred in &quot;Turn the River&quot;, for which she was awarded the Special Recognition Best Actress Award at the Hamptons International Film Festival. The following year, she starred in Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;Taken&quot;. Janssen continued to work in television, appearing in TV pilots for NBC&#x27;s police drama &quot;Winters&quot; and Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Farm&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;The L Word&quot; set in a women&#x27;s prison. Both pilots were rejected by their networks. Janssen provided the Dutch language narration for the Studio Tram Tour at all Disney theme parks.

In 2011, Janssen made her directorial debut with the drama &quot;Bringing Up Bobby&quot;. She wrote the screenplay to the film, which stars Milla Jovovich, Bill Pullman, and Marcia Cross. She reprised her role as Lenore Mills in &quot;Taken 2&quot; (2012) and &quot;Taken 3&quot; (2014). She starred as the main villain Muriel in &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters&quot; (2013).

Janssen starred in the Netflix original horror thriller television series &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot;, wherein she plays the role of family matriarch Olivia Godfrey. Janssen had a recurring role in the ABC crime thriller television series &quot;How To Get Away With Murder&quot;, appearing in 10 episodes throughout the series, beginning her role in season two of the show and concluding it in the series finale.

Janssen was cast in a starring role in the NBC crime thriller, &quot;The Blacklist: Redemption&quot;, a spin-off of the NBC series &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, in March 2016; it was picked up to series in May 2016. The following month, Janssen expressed frustration in not being cast in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, saying Hollywood was sexist toward older women. She said, &quot;Women, it&#x27;s interesting because they&#x27;re replaced, and the older versions are never to be seen again... whereas the men are allowed to be both ages.&quot;

In 2019, she served as a juror for the Tribeca Film Festival. Also in 2019, Janssen joined Jeffrey Dean Morgan in &quot;The Postcard Killings&quot;, which was released in 2020. In 2021, Janssen starred in the Christian romantic drama film &quot;Redeeming Love&quot; and the action-thriller &quot;Dangerous&quot;.

In a March 2021 interview, she revealed to Forbes some details about her involvement with the live action adaptation of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, a popular anime and manga. Janssen declared that filming was supposed to take place in Europe the previous year, but production had been postponed twice due to the Coronavirus pandemic. She also hinted that she will play one of the main characters, but did not specify their name.

==Activism==
Janssen appeared with her dog, Licorice, a brindle Boston Terrier, in a 2007 PETA campaign to raise awareness for animal rights. The campaign used the slogan &quot;Be an Angel for Animals.&quot; On 28 January 2008, she was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for Integrity for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime at a United Nations anticorruption conference held in Nusa Dua, Bali.

<doc id="555624" wikidata="Q2660511" url="?curid=555624" title="Brand (play)">
<text>Brand is a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. It is a verse tragedy, written in 1865 and first performed in Stockholm, Sweden on 24 March 1867. 

Brand is a priest who accepts the consequence of his choices, and is deeply bound to doing the &quot;right thing&quot;. He believes primarily in the will of man, and lives by the belief &quot;all or nothing&quot;. To make compromises is therefore difficult, or questionable. Brand&#x27;s beliefs render him lonely, because those around him, when put to the test, generally cannot or will not follow his example. He is a young idealist whose main purpose is to save the world, or at least people&#x27;s souls, but his judgment of others is harsh and unfair.

The word &quot;brand&quot; means &quot;fire&quot; in Norwegian (in the spelling of Ibsen&#x27;s lifetime, spelled &quot;brann&quot; today), Danish, Swedish, German and Dutch. However Brand, Brandt, Brant and similar names are also known as surnames in Scandinavia, Germany and other countries, derived from the Germanic personal name Brando (&quot;sword&quot;).

==Plot==
===First act===
Brand in the mountains confronts different kinds of people: a farmer traveling with his son, who does not dare to brave a glacier on behalf of his dying daughter; Einar, a young painter with an easy-going attitude, and his fiancée, Agnes; and finally, a fifteen-year-old girl, Gerd, who claims to know of a bigger church in the mountains and hunts for a great hawk. 

Einar and Brand were in school together. Brand taunts Einar for portraying God as an old man, who &quot;sees through his fingers&quot;; Brand wants to envision God as a young, heroic saviour. He believes that people have become too sloppy about their sins and shortcomings, because of the dogma that Christ, through his sacrifice, cleansed humanity once and for all. 

Brand vows to confront the mindsets he has just met: the lazy mind, the undisciplined mind, and the wild mind. He ponders humanity&#x27;s purpose and what should be.

===Second act===
In the valley where he was born, Brand finds great famine and need. The bailiff distributes bread for the hungry, and Brand questions the need for it. Meanwhile, a mother tells of her husband who needs absolution because he killed one of his children rather than seeing him starve. Then he harmed himself. Nobody dares to venture the rough fjord, but Brand goes in a boat and, to his surprise, Agnes follows him. Together, Brand and Agnes sail across the fjord, and the man receives absolution. A couple of farmers demand that he stay with them as their priest. Brand is reluctant to do this, but they use his own words against him, and he gives in. 

Agnes tells of an &quot;inner world being born&quot; in one of Ibsen&#x27;s best known soliloquies. She renounces Einar and chooses Brand. In the end of the second act, we meet Brand&#x27;s mother, and learn that he grew up under the glacier, in a dreary place with no sun.

===Third act===
Some years later, Brand and Agnes live together with their son, Alf, who is grievously ill because of the climate. The local doctor urges him to leave for the sake of his son, but he hesitates. Meanwhile, Brand&#x27;s mother is dying, and Brand impresses on her that she will not receive absolution unless she gives all her money to charity. She refuses, and Brand refuses to go to her. 

On the question of his son&#x27;s health, the doctor says that it is right to be &quot;humane&quot;, whereas Brand answers: &quot;Was God humane towards his son?&quot; He states that by modern standards, the sacrifice of Christ would have boiled down to a &quot;diplomatic heavenly charter&quot;. He clearly means that there is a difference between being a &quot;human&quot;, and being a &quot;humanist&quot;. In the end he almost gives in, but the farmers come to him and plead with him to stay. Then Gerd shows up, and states that evil forces will prevail if he leaves. The final straw is when she points out that his son is his &quot;false god&quot;. Then he gives in and stays, knowing this will take his son&#x27;s life. It is clear that he wants Agnes to choose for him, and she answers: &quot;Go the road your God appointed for you&quot;.

===Fourth act===
After the death of his son, Brand wishes to build a bigger church in the parish. He refuses to mourn. Agnes comforts herself with the clothes of her dead son.

The bailiff is opposed to Brand, and tells him that he has growing support in the parish, explaining his own plans for building public institutions like a poorhouse, a jail and a political hall. The bailiff reveals that Brand&#x27;s mother was forced to break with her true love, and married an old miser instead. The boy she loved then became involved with a Roma woman, resulting in the birth of Gerd. Brand is the result of the other, clearly loveless affair, and the bailiff suggests some kind of spiritual relationship between Brand and Gerd. After the bailiff leaves, a Roma woman arrives, demanding clothes for her freezing child (it is Christmas Eve). Brand then puts Agnes to the test, and she gives all of Alf&#x27;s clothes to the Roma woman. As a result of this, Agnes renounces her life, and exclaims &quot;I&#x27;m free&quot;. Brand accepts this, and Agnes dies.

===Fifth act===
Brand gets his new church built but comes to believe that his new church is still too small, and rebels against the authorities, the local dean and the bailiff. The provost talks about getting people to heaven &quot;by the parish&quot;, and denounces individual thinking. Brand&#x27;s answers to this are mostly sarcastic. The provost ends his speech mentioning the &quot;erasing of God in the soul of man&quot;, something of which he seems to approve. Brand wants the opposite: individual freedom and a clear picture of God in man&#x27;s soul.

Einar returns as a missionary soon after the provost&#x27;s friendly speech. He has worked out a view of life that makes Brand shiver. Whereas Brand mourns the loss of his wife, Einar in the end thinks her death was righteous, because he regards her as a female seducer. 

Brand protests against the heavy plight lain upon him by his elders, throws the key to the church into the fjord and makes for the mountain with the entire parish following him. He urges the people to &quot;lift their faith&quot; and make a &quot;Church without limits&quot; that is meant to embrace all sides of life. Brand states that they all shall be priests in the task of relieving all people from thralldom. The other clergymen protest against this because they no longer have any sway over their flocks. Brand is greatly respected by the common people, but the test is in the end too hard. They are lured down to the valley again by the bailiff, who fakes news of great economic opportunity (a large quantity of fish in the sea). The same people who followed Brand, then chase him with stones in their hands.

Brand is then left alone, struggling with doubt, remorse, and temptation, &quot;the spirit of compromise&quot;. He does not yield to it, even when the spirit claims to be Agnes. The spirit says that the fall of man forever closed the gates to Paradise, but Brand states that the road of longing is still open. Then the spirit flees and says: &quot;Die! The world does not need you!&quot;. Brand meets Gerd again, who thinks she sees the saviour in him, but Brand denies this. At the end of the play, Gerd takes him to the glacier, her personal church, and Brand recoils when understanding where he is, the &quot;Ice-cathedral&quot;. He breaks down in tears. Gerd, who has been hunting the hawk from the start of the play, fires a shot at it, and lets loose a great avalanche, which in the end buries the entire valley.

In his dying words, Brand screams out to God, asking, &quot;Does not salvation consider the will of man?&quot; The final words are from an unknown voice: &quot;He is the god of caritas.&quot;

==Analysis==

===Topics===
The play debates freedom of will and the consequential choice. The problem is further debated in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. A crucial point is the discussion about the absence of love, and the sacrifice of Christ. As a consequence, the imitation of Christ can be regarded as a theme of the play (cf. Thomas à Kempis). A key to this interpretation is found in the name of Agnes, clearly derived from Agnus Dei, the lamb of God or the sacrificial lamb. One should be aware that Brand never asks anyone to sacrifice themselves for his cause. He rather warns them off, if they wish to pledge themselves to him – as is the case of Agnes. But when she chooses, Brand reminds her of the moral consequence of that choice – it is final, and there is no turning back. Agnes chooses anyway, both the sweet and the bitter.

One can also see a discussion in the play about what the Christian message really means, and what God&#x27;s purpose with humankind really is. At one point Brand says: &quot;The goal is to become blackboards for God to write upon&quot;. A reminiscence of this is found in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;: &quot;I was a paper, and was never written upon&quot;. The topics of the two plays are clearly related.

&quot;Brand&quot; was Ibsen&#x27;s breakthrough as playwright and author. Ibsen was himself fond of the play&#x27;s main character, and claimed that Brand was &quot;himself in his best moments&quot;.

===Brand&#x27;s vision===
Brand&#x27;s vision is arguably a romantic one, and his address in the fifth act resembles in a way Henrik Wergeland`s vision in his great poem &quot;Man&quot;. His rebellion against the clergy, whom he feels are leading people astray rather than in the right direction, is also foreshadowed by Wergeland. He states here that &quot;the spirit of compromise&quot;, a mentality he struggles to get free from all the way, is none other than Satan. When he is tempted later, we should be aware of this. 

From the beginning, Brand wishes to make man whole, because he is aware that there has been a split, a sundering somewhere in the past, and he wishes to fight a fragmented view of man and God. This fragmentation makes man weak, he states, and an easy prey to temptation – a result of the fall of man. The definition of wholeness as a greater good and fragmentarism as a bad thing, is a philosophical statement, originally derived from Plato and Pythagoras. The sentence about a Christianity that embraces all sides of life, resembles the view of the Danish priest Grundtvig.

Throughout the play, we see that Brand looks for the right way to solve this problem, and makes new discoveries as he moves forward. One can also interpret the entire play as a tale of a developing soul, struggling with his connection to God. In this view, the collapse at the very end is a collapse of Brand&#x27;s conflicting self, and the disaster opens a closed road for him. Thus, the final words of Gerd makes sense, as she finally manages to shoot the great hawk, with the words: &quot;Salvation comes&quot;. This interpretation makes Gerd a restless voice in Brand&#x27;s soul.

The play can also be seen as a discussion of romanticism and reality, in a quite disillusional way. Ibsen at this stage leaves romanticism well behind, and moves on to greater realism.

Some also consider Brand&#x27;s character to have been based on the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard gave an essential place in his philosophy to the opposition between faith and reason, the importance of making decisive choices and suffering in the name of God, and whose life ended during an official attack he led against the church of his country (which he thought perverted the original Christian message, making it an empty religion).

Otto Weininger saw the play as expressing a deep understanding of Kantian ethics:-

==Musical setting(s)==
The symphonic poem by the Austrian composer Johanna Müller-Hermann (opus 25) composed in 1919 is a narrative meditation on themes from Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Brand&quot;, with the title &quot;Epilog zur einer Tragödie &quot;Brand&quot;&quot;.

<text>The 2002–03 NHL season was the 86th regular season of the National Hockey League. The Stanley Cup winners were the New Jersey Devils, who won the best of seven series 4–3 against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
==League business==
===Entry draft===
The 2002 NHL Entry Draft was held on June 22 and 23, 2002 at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Rick Nash was selected first overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets.

===Rule changes===
The league approved the following rule changes:

* Following the death of Brittanie Cecil during the previous season, netting at both ends of the rink became mandatory, and the minimum height of the glass around the entire rink was raised to five feet.
* &quot;Hurry-up&quot; faceoff and line-change rules were implemented, similar to ones used by the American Hockey League. Except during the final two minutes of a game and after a goal is scored, the visiting team has five seconds to complete a line change during stoppages, and the home team has eight seconds. The linesman will then blow his whistle and drop the puck within five seconds, regardless if one or both teams&#x27; centres are lined up at the faceoff dot. If a centre is offside before getting properly lined up by the five seconds, he will get a warning before getting subsequent delay of game penalties.

==Arena changes==
* The Carolina Hurricanes&#x27; home arena, Raleigh Sports and Entertainment Arena, was renamed RBC Center as part of a new naming rights agreement with RBC Bank.
* The Florida Panthers&#x27; home arena, National Car Rental Center, was renamed Office Depot Center as part of a new naming rights agreement with Office Depot.
* The Montreal Canadiens&#x27; home arena, Molson Centre, was renamed Bell Centre as part of a new naming rights agreement with Bell Canada.
* The San Jose Sharks&#x27; home arena, the Compaq Center, was renamed the HP Pavilion, in recognition of Compaq&#x27;s parent company Hewlett-Packard (HP) retiring the Compaq brand.
* The Tampa Bay Lightning&#x27;s home arena, the Ice Palace, was renamed the St. Pete Times Forum as part of a new naming rights agreement with the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; newspaper.

==Regular season==
===All-Star Game===
The All-Star Game was played on February 2, 2003, at Office Depot Center in Sunrise, the home of the Florida Panthers. The game returned to a Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference format.

===Highlights===
The regular season saw several surprises. The San Jose Sharks, who many felt would be one of the elite teams in the West, stumbled early and badly disassembled much of the team. The two-year-old Minnesota Wild, on the other hand, got out to an early start and held onto their first-ever playoff berth throughout the season, winning coach Jacques Lemaire the Jack Adams Award.

The most surprising team was probably the Tampa Bay Lightning, which many had predicted to finish last, winning their first Southeast Division title and making the playoffs for the first time in seven years. The most disappointing teams, other than the Sharks, were the New York Rangers, who finished out of the playoffs again despite bearing the league&#x27;s leading payroll, and the Carolina Hurricanes, who finished last overall after a surprise run to the Stanley Cup Finals the year before. On January 8, 2003, Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Michael Leighton gained a shutout in his NHL debut in a 0–0 tie versus the Phoenix Coyotes. Coyotes goaltender Zac Bierk earned his first career shutout, although it was not his NHL debut. It was the first—and with the abolition of ties two years later, the only—time that two goalies in the same game both earned their first career shutouts.

At the midpoint of the season, the Canucks led the Western Conference and Ottawa led the East. Vancouver stumbled somewhat over the stretch and lost the Northwest Division title to Colorado and the Western Conference to Dallas. Ottawa continued to dominate, having the best season in franchise history and winning both the Eastern Conference and the Presidents&#x27; Trophy.

The season was also marred by financial difficulties. Despite their success, the Ottawa Senators were in bankruptcy protection for almost all of 2003, and at one point could not pay the players. Owner Rod Bryden tried a variety of innovative financing strategies, but these all failed and the team was purchased after the season by billionaire Eugene Melnyk. The Buffalo Sabres also entered bankruptcy protection before being bought by New York businessman Tom Golisano. The financial struggles of the Pittsburgh Penguins continued as the team continued to unload its most expensive players.

The season was marked by a great number of coaches being fired, from Bob Hartley in Colorado to Darryl Sutter in San Jose and Bryan Trottier of the New York Rangers.

Worries over the decline in scoring and the neutral zone trap continued. The season began with an attempted crack down on obstruction and interference, but by the midpoint of the season this effort had petered out.

==Playoffs==

===Bracket===
In each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team played at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top eight teams in each conference made the playoffs, with the three division winners seeded 1–3 based on regular season record, and the five remaining teams seeded 4–8.

The NHL used &quot;re-seeding&quot; instead of a fixed bracket playoff system. During the first three rounds, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed, the second-highest remaining seed played the second-lowest remaining seed, and so forth. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. The two conference winners then advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where home ice advantage was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.

==Broadcasting==
===Canada===
This was the first season of the league&#x27;s Canadian national broadcast rights deals with CBC and TSN. CBC continued to air Saturday night &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; regular season games, while TSN&#x27;s coverage included &quot;Wednesday Night Hockey&quot; and other selected weeknights. Stanley Cup playoff coverage on cable expanded beyond the first round, with TSN allowed to televise all-U.S. games up to the Conference Finals. CBC still aired all playoff games involving Canadian teams, as well as exclusive coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals.

===United States===
This was the fourth year of the league&#x27;s five-year U.S. national broadcast rights deal with ESPN and ABC. ESPN and ESPN2 aired weeknight games throughout the regular season. ABC&#x27;s coverage included the All-Star Game and five weeks worth of regional games on Saturday afternoons between January and March. During the first two rounds of the playoffs, ESPN and ESPN2 aired selected games, while ABC had Saturday regional telecasts. Each U.S. team&#x27;s regional broadcaster produced local coverage of first and second round games (except for those games on ABC). ABC&#x27;s weekend telecasts continued into the Conference Finals, while ESPN had the rest of the third round games. ESPN then aired the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals before the rest of the series shifted to ABC.

<doc id="555629" wikidata="Q759359" url="?curid=555629" title="The Cannonball Run">
<text>The Cannonball Run is a 1981 action-comedy film directed by Hal Needham, produced by Hong Kong firm Golden Harvest, and distributed by 20th Century-Fox. Filmed in Panavision, it features an all-star ensemble cast, including Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Jackie Chan,  Sammy Davis Junior and Dean Martin. The film is based on the 1979 running of the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an actual cross-country outlaw road race beginning in Connecticut and ending in California.

It was the sixth-highest-grossing domestic film of 1981 and became the first installment of the &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; trilogy. It was followed by &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1983) (which was far less successful at the box office and with critics) and &quot;Speed Zone&quot; (1989). This film and its sequel were the final film appearances of actor Dean Martin. It also featured Jackie Chan in his second Hollywood role.

&quot;Cannonball&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot; (1976) were two other motion pictures based on the actual Cannonball Run outlaw road race.

==Plot==

Race teams have gathered in Connecticut to start a cross-country car race. One at a time, teams drive up to the starters&#x27; stand, punch a time card to indicate their time of departure, then take off.

Among the teams:
* JJ McClure, a famous racing driver and team owner, and Victor Prinzi, his chief mechanic and occasional co-driver, drive a Dodge Tradesman ambulance.
* Drunken former F1 icon Jamie Blake and his gambling-obsessed teammate Morris Fenderbaum, dressed as Catholic priests, drive a red Ferrari 308 GTS 1979. 
* Jill Rivers and Marcie Thatcher, two attractive women who use their looks to their advantage, start the race in a black Lamborghini Countach.
* Two Japanese drivers race in a high-tech, computer-laden Subaru DL 4WD hatchback, which is also equipped with a rocket booster engine.
* A pair of good ol&#x27; boys drive a street-legal replica of Donnie Allison&#x27;s Hawaiian Tropic-sponsored NASCAR Winston Cup Series Chevrolet stock car owned by Hoss Ellington. 
* Seymour Goldfarb, Jr, a rich British playboy who in his professional life is the famous actor Roger Moore, who drives a silver Aston Martin DB5.
* Abdul ben Falafel, a wealthy oil-rich Middle-Eastern sheikh, driving a white Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow.

At the starting line, observing from the shadows, is Mr. Arthur J. Foyt (the name is a fictionalized play on real life racer A. J. Foyt), a representative of the &quot;Safety Enforcement Unit&quot;, who tries to stop the race because of its environmental effects and safety issues. In the car with Foyt is a photographer and tree lover, Pamela Glover.

Beyond the starting line, JJ and Victor (driving their ambulance) come across Foyt and Glover, who have been involved in a minor accident. Glover implores JJ and Victor to help, but when they tell Foyt to enter the ambulance through the back door, they kidnap Glover and take off without Foyt.

As the race progresses, Victor occasionally turns into his alter ego, superhero &quot;Captain Chaos.&quot; Dr. Van Helsing and his huge hypodermic needle are also in the ambulance to &quot;help&quot; keep Glover quiet during the race.

Various teams are shown either evading law enforcement, most of which deal with talking their way out of a possible ticket, or concocting crazy schemes to outmaneuver their opponents.
* Jill and Marcie use sex appeal as their weapon, unzipping their race suits to display copious amounts of cleavage during traffic stops. 
* In New Jersey, the ambulance is pulled over by state troopers. Dr. Van Helsing drugs Glover, and JJ and Victor are able to convince the troopers that they are rushing &quot;the Senator&#x27;s wife&quot; to UCLA for medical treatment whilst claiming the theory, which to JJ and Victor&#x27;s happy surprise is Van Helsing&#x27;s idea, that her condition prevents them from flying, or from even driving through Denver.
* The Subaru team is able to turn off their car&#x27;s headlights and use infrared sensors for racing at night.
* Seymour Goldfarb is frequently shown evading police by using various James Bond-type gadgets, such as oil slicks, smoke screens, switchable license plates, all installed in his Aston Martin DB5.
* Mr. Compton and &quot;Super Chief&quot; Finch disguise themselves as a newlywed couple on a motorcycle, but Finch&#x27;s extra weight forces the two to ride cross-country in a continuous wheelie.

The primary rivalry is between the ambulance and the Ferrari. In Ohio, Fenderbaum and Blake are able to convince Victor to stop the ambulance in order to bless the patient on board. While Blake administers the blessing, Fenderbaum flattens one of the ambulance&#x27;s rear tires. JJ achieves revenge in Missouri by convincing a nearby police officer that the two men dressed as priests are actually perverts who are responsible for the flashing victim in the ambulance.

The leading teams find themselves stopped on a desert highway, waiting for construction workers to clear the road. A biker gang arrives and harasses Compton and Finch. It quickly escalates into a melee. &quot;Captain Chaos&quot; emerges to fight the bikers. The Subaru team also joins the fight, using martial arts to great effect. The construction crew announces that the road is open, so the teams sprint back to their cars to resume the race.

The ambulance falls behind the pack until Victor once again becomes Captain Chaos. The vehicles all arrive at the final destination at the same time, resulting in a foot race to the finish line. JJ hands his team&#x27;s time card to Victor, then ambushes the remaining racers, leaving only Victor and one of the Lamborghini women, Marcie. Just when it appears Victor will reach the time clock first, a spectator shouts that her &quot;baby&quot; has fallen into the water. Victor, still in his Captain Chaos persona, rushes to save the baby, which is later revealed to be the spectator&#x27;s dog, this allows Marcie to clock in first at the finishing point.

JJ is furious and never wants to see Captain Chaos again, but Victor replies that he does not care, becoming the persona he really wants to be, Captain USA. JJ laughs and hugs him. Foyt reappears and blames everyone for ruining the American highway. Seymour offers a cigar and tells Foyt to use the lighter in his car, which activates an ejection seat when pushed. Nothing happens at first, but when Seymour presses the button, he (Seymour) is ejected through the roof and into the nearby water.

==Cast==
&quot;Cannonball Run&quot; featured an all-star ensemble cast, including these actors:
* Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise as racer J.J. McClure and his buddy, Victor Prinzim who occasionally &quot;becomes&quot; his alter ego &quot;Captain Chaos&quot;, to the annoyance of J.J.
* Roger Moore as Seymour Goldfarb Jr. He is self-parody of his role as James Bond. The car that he drives is an Aston Martin DB5, displays the UK registration plate 6633 PP (matching the number plates on a DB5 from two Bond films, although Moore never drove an Aston Martin in any of his Bond appearances). Molly Picon portrays his mother. Five women ride with Seymour, including model Lois Hamilton, billed as Lois Areno, with Simone Burton, Finele Carpenter, Susan McDonald, and Janet Woytak. Moore&#x27;s next Bond film, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, premiered on June 24, 1981, only a few days after &quot;The Cannonball Run.&quot;
* Farrah Fawcett as tree-loving photographer Pamela Glover. J.J. calls her &quot;Beauty.&quot;
* Dean Martin, as race car driver Jamie Blake, and Sammy Davis Jr. as scam artist and degenerate gambler Morris Fenderbaum, both disguised as Catholic priests. Jimmy &quot;The Greek&quot; Snyder plays himself as Fenderbaum bets on his success (Snyder was Dean Martin&#x27;s neighbor when both were growing up in Steubenville, Ohio). Blake&#x27;s car, a Ferrari 308 GTS 1979, is the same as the model in the TV series TV &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;
* George Furth as Arthur J. Foyt, the insipid, uptight main antagonist of the film, who tries to have the race stopped
* Jackie Chan and Michael Hui as drivers of a Subaru GL filled with gadgets. In the opening part of the film, Chan and Hui are introduced on a talk show (hosted by Johnny Yune) as the operators of Japan&#x27;s entry into the race. Both Chan and Hui are actually Hongkongers (Chinese). Jackie Chan&#x27;s character is referred to as &quot;Jackie Chan.&quot;
* Jamie Farr as Sheik Abdul Ben Falafel, a wealthy Arabian potentate determined to win the race, even if he has to buy it. Bianca Jagger makes a brief appearance as his sister. Farr&#x27;s car is a souped-up Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. The Sheik is the only character to appear in all three &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; films.
* Mel Tillis and Terry Bradshaw are Mel and Terry, a couple of &quot;&quot; driving a 1976 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna NASCAR Hawaiian Tropic replica, then, at the start of the race they have a Monte Carlo.
* Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman as Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers, satin-Spandex-clad &quot;hotties&quot; in a black Lamborghini Countach who distract police officers with cleavage. The same Lamborghini was used in the film&#x27;s opening credits as it was being pursued by a Nevada Highway Patrol car after spray-painting a 55 mph speed limit sign. Their character names are not mentioned during the story but appear in the end credits. Their names return in the sequel, though the parts were re-cast. 
* Valerie Perrine has a cameo as the state trooper pulling over the Lamborghini duo, beating them at their own game
* Peter Fonda has a cameo role referencing his motorcycle gang leader character in &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; while wearing his stars&amp;stripes leather jacket from &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The appearance of Fonda and his motorcycle gang during a halt in the race offered an excuse for Chan and others (&quot;I&#x27;m Roger Moore!&quot;) to demonstrate the fighting skills. Fonda&#x27;s big, bald buddy (&quot;Roger Who?&quot;) is played by biker movie veteran Robert Tessier
* Bert Convy as wealthy but bored executive Bradford Compton, who planned to run the Cannonball by motorcycle with the help of an old friend, Shakey Finch (Warren Berlinger), once the world&#x27;s greatest cross-country motorcyclist. The two planned to disguise themselves as newlyweds. Compton&#x27;s now portly ally forces the motorcycle into a wheelie for the entire race.
* Jack Elam as Dr. Nikolas Van Helsing, same name as the famous vampire hunter. This Van Helsing is a proctologist and graduate of the University of Rangoon, and the Knoxville, Tennessee College of Faith Healing.
* Rick Aviles and Alfie Wise as &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, tow truck drivers who jump the train flatcar.
* John Fiedler as the desk clerk.
* Joe Klecko as the Polish driver in the van who gets pulled over by Mr. Foyt (Klecko was not only an active player in the National Football League, like Bradshaw, but also a trucker in the off season).
* &quot;Car and Driver&quot; Magazine columnist and correspondent Brock Yates, who having created the real-life Cannonball Run, wrote the film directly for the screen, plays the race organizer of who lays down the rules at the starting line.
* Director Hal Needham appears uncredited as the ambulance EMT.
* Veteran Daytona 500 commentator Ken Squier, along with NFL on CBS producer Robert D. Stenner, who produced the CBS Daytona 500 broadcasts from 1979 to 1993 (except in 1992), appear as California Highway Patrolmen.
* Veteran voice actor June Foray provided the dubbed dialogue of several of the women who escort Goldfarb in the race (&quot;Seymour&#x27;s girls&quot;, as the opening credits list them) in an uncredited performance.

==Production==
The film continued director Hal Needham&#x27;s tradition of showing a gag reel of bloopers during the closing credits (a practice he started with &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II)&quot;. Jackie Chan says this inspired him to do the same at the end of most of his films.

===Original race===
The film is based on the 1979 running of the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an actual cross-country outlaw road race held four times in the 1970s, starting at the Red Ball Garage on 31st Street in New York City (later the Lock, Stock and Barrel Restaurant in Darien, Connecticut) and ending at the Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach, California, in Los Angeles.

The screenwriter was automotive journalist Brock Yates, who had conceived the real-life Cannonball Baker event. Yates had originally proposed the race as a writer for &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. The race had only one rule: &quot;All competitors will drive any vehicle of their choosing, over any route, at any speed they judge practical, between the starting point and destination. The competitor finishing with the lowest elapsed time is the winner&quot;.

Yates&#x27; team was the only participant in the original 1971 running, which was named after the driver Ernest &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker, who drove across country in 1927 and made it in 60 hours. Yates wrote a book about it called &quot;The Sunday Driver&quot;. In 1973 it was reported John G. Avildsen and writer Eugene Price was to make a film based on the book called &quot;The Cannonball-Baker-Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash&quot;. The film was not made but the race did inspire the (unrelated) 1976 films &quot;Cannonball&quot; and &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;.

====1979 race====
In the March 1979 race Yates formed one of 46 teams with director Hal Needham to compete with a 150-MPH van converted into an ambulance, with LA doctor Lyell Royer, and Brock&#x27;s second wife, Pamela Reynolds, riding as the patient on the gurney. Although the ambulance never made it to the finish line — the transmission gave out 50 miles short of the Redondo Beach finish line — Yates made it to the movie as a race official and Needham as an EMT, as did the ambulance itself and even the transmission failure. The ambulance was stopped once, in Pennsylvania; that event made it into the movie, as did a cop stopping traffic in Kansas, exiting from a rodeo, to let the ambulance pass unimpeded.

The Right Bra team was put together by auto writer Judy Stropus, race driver Donna Mae Mims and Peggy Niemcek, whose husband was part of another entry, driving a Cadillac limousine. In the movie, it became a two-woman team led by buxom Adrienne Barbeau driving a Lamborghini, but as auto writer Stropus said decades later, &quot;a little editorial license never hurt anyone&quot;. Yates points out in his book &quot;Cannonball!&quot; that Stropus&#x27;s version of the race does not mention the baptism with green fluid from the portable toilet the three girls experienced when the limousine overturned.

===Script===
The characters J.J. and Victor participate in the Cannonball Run in an ambulance: a heavily modified Dodge van. In the beginning, J.J. says to himself &quot;we could get a black Trans Am&quot;, then answers his own question with &quot;Nah that&#x27;s been done&quot;, a reference to the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; films of Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham.

In an attempt to appear legitimate to law enforcement, the team of J.J. and Victor hires Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, a frightening, yet friendly, physician of questionable skill played by Jack Elam. They kidnap attractive young photographer Pamela Glover (Farrah Fawcett) — whom they nickname &quot;Beauty&quot; — to be their cover patient. Beauty vehemently opposes her kidnapping first, but eventually comes to sympathize with her captors and falls for J.J.

===Development===
Yates and Needham worked on a script and Al Ruddy became attached as producer. They wanted Reynolds to star, but he was reluctant to make more car-themed films. He was eventually persuaded by Needham&#x27;s promise to keep the actor&#x27;s schedule to only 14 days of filming, and a fee of $5 million plus a percentage of the profits. Finance came from Raymond Chow of Golden Harvest, who requested that Jackie Chan be included in the cast.

Reynolds later said of &quot;Cannonball Run&quot;: &quot;I did that film for all the wrong reasons. I never liked it. I did it to help out a friend of mine, Hal Needham. And I also felt it was immoral to turn down that kind of money. I suppose I sold out so I couldn&#x27;t really object to what people wrote about me.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
A huge commercial success, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; opened June 19, 1981 on 1,673 screens and grossed $11,765,574 in its opening weekend, the fourth highest opening of all time, but this was not enough to beat &quot;Superman II&quot; that opened the same weekend with a record-breaking $14,100,523. The film went on to gross $72,179,579 in the United States and Canada, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1981, behind &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, &quot;Superman II&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot;, and &quot;Stripes&quot;.

It was also successful overseas. In France, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; sold 988,509 box office admissions in 1981. In Germany, the film sold 4,825,937 admissions, becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1981. In Japan, it was the second highest-grossing foreign film of 1982, grossing at the box office. The film grossed over worldwide in its initial run, and went on to gross a worldwide total of .

===Critical response===
Despite its box office success, most critics reviewed the film negatively. It has received an approval rating of 29% on Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Cannonball Run&quot; casts a bevy of famous faces as its wacky racers but forgets to give them characters to play, resulting in 90 dull minutes that feel like a marathon&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film a half-star out of four, calling it &quot;an abdication of artistic responsibility at the lowest possible level of ambition. In other words, they didn&#x27;t even care enough to make a good lousy movie&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;full of terribly inside showbiz jokes and populated by what could be called Burt and Hal&#x27;s Rat Pack, film takes place in that redneck never-never land where most of the guys are beer-guzzling good ole boys and all the gals are fabulously built tootsies&quot;.
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;inoffensive and sometimes funny. Because there are only a limited number of variations that can be worked out on this same old highway race, don&#x27;t bother to see it unless you&#x27;re already hooked on the genre&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for Fawcett, but lost to Diana Scarwid for the cult film &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;.

==Accident==
On June 25, 1980, 24-year-old German American stuntwoman Heidi von Beltz, a former championship skier, stuntwoman, and aspiring actress, was critically injured in a car crash during production of the film. The original stunt person had left the production to attend an emergency family illness, and the stunt coordinator Bobby Bass called his then-fiancée von Beltz to the set for a stunt that he said was to be &quot;a piece of cake.&quot; The car was to be driven by stuntman Jimmy Nickerson, and required him to weave between oncoming vehicles. Meanwhile, von Beltz was asked to ride in the passenger seat, operating a smoke machine, giving the impression the car was on fire.

The car, an Aston Martin, had been beset with mechanical problems, including defective steering, clutch, and speedometer. It also had bald tires and no seat belts. Nickerson asked for repairs to the car, and while some were done, other things were left unfixed, including the lack of seatbelts. During the planned stunt the car collided head-on with a van, breaking von Beltz&#x27; neck and leaving her quadriplegic.

When it became clear that von Beltz&#x27; personal injury lawsuit would exceed all available primary insurance coverage, the production&#x27;s excess insurer, Interstate Fire (a subsidiary of Fireman&#x27;s Fund Insurance Company) sued von Beltz and her employer, Stuntman Inc., for a declaratory judgment that von Beltz&#x27;s lawsuit was not covered under its policy. In 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that there &quot;was&quot; a duty to defend, and that there was also a duty to indemnify to the extent that von Beltz was seeking recovery for mental injuries (the exclusion for bodily injuries was ruled to be enforceable).

She was eventually awarded $7 million although a judge reduced the amount and she ended up with $3.2 million. Much of the settlement went to her attorneys and to paying off medical bills. Her lawsuit against the movie&#x27;s producers led to required seat-belt use in all stunt cars and caused the Directors Guild to prohibit directors from altering stunts on location. She died in October 2015 at age 59.

==Legacy==
The film was followed by two sequels, &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1983) and &quot;Speed Zone&quot; (1989). &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; and &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; were Dean Martin&#x27;s last films. The film also featured Jackie Chan in his second Hollywood role after &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; (1980).

Sega AM2 game designer Yu Suzuki cited &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; as an influence on his hit 1986 arcade racing game &quot;Out Run&quot;.

===Remake===
Warner Bros. has acquired the rights to the &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; franchise and in 2016 set Etan Cohen to write and direct a remake as &quot;Cannonball&quot;. Andre Morgan and Alan Gasmer were hired as producers.

Doug Liman was in early talks to direct the film from a script by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant in June 2018.

<text>Baron Abercromby, &quot;of Aboukir and Tullibody&quot;, was a title in the peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 28 May 1801 for Mary, Lady Abercromby, in honour of her husband, the noted military commander Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, who won the Battle of Aboukir in 1801 and later died from wounds at the Battle of Alexandria. The latter was the grandson of Alexander Abercromby, member of the Scottish Parliament for Clackmannanshire from 1703 to 1707, younger son of Sir Alexander Abercromby, 1st Baronet, of Birkenbog (see Abercromby baronets). 

Lady Abercromby was succeeded by her eldest son, George, the second baron. He represented Edinburgh and Clackmannan in the House of Commons. On his death the title passed to his son George, the third baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Clackmannanshire, Stirling and Clackmannan and Kinross. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth baron. He was deputy lieutenant of Stirlingshire in 1860. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother John, the fifth baron. He was president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. On his death in 1924 without male issue the barony became extinct.

James Abercromby, third son of Sir Ralph Abercromby and Baroness Abercromby, served as speaker of the House of Commons from 1835 to 1839 and was created Baron Dunfermline in 1839.

<doc id="555639" wikidata="Q2437668" url="?curid=555639" title="The Enid">
<text>The Enid are a British progressive rock band founded by keyboardist and composer Robert John Godfrey. Godfrey received his main musical education from The Royal College of Music. He is previously known for his work with Barclay James Harvest, and as a recording artist on the Charisma label. In 2014, he won the Visionary Award (Progressive Music Awards) for establishing an early fan-based crowdfunding model to finance the band named The Stand.

In 1973, Godfrey, together with friends Francis Lickerish, Stephen Stewart and David Williams founded The Enid. They had all met at the famous experimental educational establishment, Finchden Manor. In 1974, they were joined by Dave Storey and Glen Tollet.

==History==
The Enid began recording at about the same time as punk rock burst upon the music scene. Godfrey has said that he always regarded The Enid&#x27;s ironic takes on classical music as being just as anarchic as anything by the Sex Pistols, but this did not translate into either musical or commercial recognition, despite their work being played frequently by Tommy Vance on BBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot;. However, unique among progressive rock bands, the Enid secured a fan base which significantly overlapped with the punk rock fan base. Thanks largely to their quirky appearance and stage act, they built a sizable campus following even while under the shadow of the punk movement.

Early albums were entirely instrumental due to the suicide of founding vocalist Peter Roberts on New Year&#x27;s Day 1975, shortly before rehearsals for the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;In the Region of the Summer Stars&quot;; the band considered Roberts to be irreplaceable.

The band&#x27;s record label, Pye Records, folded on the eve of releasing a double compilation album, &quot;Rhapsody in Rock&quot;, leaving the Enid with substantial bills and no income to cover them. Only continued touring kept the band afloat. In 1981, the Enid were Kim Wilde&#x27;s backing band on her self-titled debut album. However, according to Godfrey, because the album was recorded in the Enid&#x27;s studio, they were paid only &quot;a pittance&quot; for their work on it. During this period founding member Francis Lickerish was ousted from the Enid following a failed attempt to take leadership of the group from Godfrey.

The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, released in 1983, was the first Enid album to feature lyrics, which were written by then-drummer Chris North and sung in a mock-operatic style by Godfrey. The release was a concept album dealing with the threat of nuclear warfare and the various ways in which people respond to it.

The Enid released no full-length albums between 1997 and 2010, when &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; was released, although 2009&#x27;s &quot;Arise and Shine&quot; featured newly remixed and partly re-recorded tracks from previous albums plus one preview of a &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; track.

In December 2012, the band&#x27;s thirteenth album &quot;Invicta&quot; was voted 9th in &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Readers&#x27; albums of 2012&quot; poll, with &quot;The One and the Many&quot; placed 6th in the &quot;Readers&#x27; tracks of 2012&quot; category.

In June 2013, it was revealed that the band&#x27;s sole remaining founding member Robert John Godfrey had been diagnosed with early Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and that as a result he was retiring from the band. The band opted to continue, with Godfrey&#x27;s consent, following his departure. The ownership and trade mark of the band name was transferred to Jason Ducker. 

Keyboardist William Gilmour founded a new band, Craft, after leaving The Enid, along with Grant McKay Gilmour and Martin Russell of Afro Celt Sound System. The band produced a self-titled mini-album in 1984 featuring Enid-style instrumentals based on six signs of the zodiac: &quot;Aries&quot;, &quot;Taurus&quot;, &quot;Gemini&quot;, &quot;Cancer&quot;, &quot;Leo&quot;, and &quot;Virgo&quot;. The album was released on CD on the American label Kinetic Discs in 1992. The CD added two short bonus tracks, &quot;Branislana&quot; and &quot;And So to Sleep&quot;, which were, if anything, even more heavily influenced by The Enid.

In March 2016 Godfrey revealed that he would be retiring from touring, with keyboardist Zach Bullock and vocalist Joe Payne covering all aspects of Godfrey&#x27;s performance; with the line-up for the following tour consisting of Bullock, Payne, guitarists Jason Ducker and Max Read, drummer Dave Storey, and new bassist Josh Judd. It was revealed the following month that Godfrey was in fact permanently retiring from the band in an official capacity.

On 5 September 2016 it was announced that Payne had departed the band after five years as frontman; and three days later it was revealed that guitarist Read and Storey had also decided to leave The Enid, and that the band now consisted of Bullock, Ducker, and returning multi-instrumentalist Dominic Tofield.

In April 2018 Godfrey announced his return to the band. A brain scan intended to determine the progress of his Alzheimer&#x27;s disease showed no presence of Alzheimer&#x27;s at all. In January 2020, The Enid consisted of two members, Godfrey and Ducker, and they were working on the new album &quot;U&quot;, which earlier was intended to be released as a Godfrey solo album called Homily.

== Marketing innovations ==

In addition to traditional vinyl and CD releases, in the late 1990s the band pioneered the production of &quot;Bespoke CDs&quot; – mail-order custom compilation CD-Rs containing rare tracks chosen by listeners from a catalogue. This service was discontinued after a couple of years.

In the 2001 the band formed a marketing agreement with Inner Sanctum that saw most of the band&#x27;s back-catalogue being reissued on that label. However, in 2009 they announced that Inner Sanctum was illegally attempting to take control of the band&#x27;s name and copyrights. As a result of the ensuing legal action the &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; album was released on the band&#x27;s own Enidiworks/Operation Seraphim label. The Enid stated that in 2010 Inner Sanctum released illegal bootlegs of the original EMI versions of &quot;In the Region of the Summer Stars&quot; and &quot;Aerie Faerie Nonsense&quot;. As a result of this EMI took action against Gerald Palmer to stop the bootlegs and agreed to grant a worldwide license to Operation Seraphim (the band&#x27;s own record label) for the three albums EMI owns (&quot;In The Region&quot;, &quot;Aerie Faerie Nonsense&quot;, and Godfrey&#x27;s 1974 solo album &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;).

In March 2006 Godfrey announced on the band&#x27;s website that he would be making its entire back catalogue available for free download as high-quality mp3s. Godfrey wrote: &quot;The purpose of this is to make sure that The Enid&#x27;s music reaches as many people as possible and does not entirely disappear when I am dead. The Enid represents my life&#x27;s work and I want it and what it contains to live on in those who warm to it. Having taken this decision it may well influence the way I think about The Enid and may drive me to do some more.&quot;

<text>Lady is a term for a woman who behaves in a polite way. Once used to describe only women of a high social class or status, the female counterpart of lord, now it may refer to any adult woman, as gentleman can be used for men. 

&quot;Lady&quot; is also a formal title in the United Kingdom. &quot;Lady&quot; is used before the family name or peerage of a woman with a title of nobility or honorary title &quot;suo jure&quot; (in her own right), such as female members of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle, or the wife of a lord, a baronet, Scottish feudal baron, laird, or a knight, and also before the first name of the daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from Old English &#x27;; the first part of the word is a mutated form of &#x27;, &quot;loaf, bread&quot;, also seen in the corresponding &quot;&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;. The second part is usually taken to be from the root &quot;dig-&quot;, &quot;to knead&quot;, seen also in dough; the sense development from bread-kneader, or bread-maker, or bread-shaper, to the ordinary meaning, though not clearly to be traced historically, may be illustrated by that of &quot;lord&quot;.

==Usage==
The primary meaning of &quot;mistress of a household&quot; is now mostly obsolete, save for the term &quot;landlady&quot; and in set phrases such as &quot;the lady of the house&quot;. This meaning is retained in the southern states of the United States. In some contexts &quot;lady&quot; is synonymous with the old-fashioned word &quot;gentlewoman&quot;, meaning someone of high social status by birth and upbringing, but not necessarily titled. The term is also used in titles such as first lady and lady mayoress, the wives of elected or appointed officials. 

In many European languages the equivalent term serves as a general form of address equivalent to the English &quot;Mrs&quot; (French &#x27;, Spanish &#x27;, Italian &#x27;, German &#x27;, Polish &#x27;, etc.). In those languages it is correct to address a woman whose name is unknown as &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, etc., but in polite English usage &quot;lady&quot; has for centuries only normally been a term of address in the plural, which is also the case for &quot;gentleman&quot;. The singular vocative use (i.e. to address someone directly) was once common but has become mostly confined to poetry. In some dialects it may still be used to address an unknown woman in a brusque manner, often in an imperative or interrogatory context, analogous to &quot;mister&quot; for an unknown male: e.g., &quot;Hey, lady, you aren&#x27;t allowed in here!&quot; In this usage, the word &quot;lady&quot; is very seldom capitalized when written. The usual English term for politely addressing a woman is &quot;madam&quot; or its abbreviation &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;.

In English, relatively few job titles are un-gendered. Some names for jobs are gender-neutral, e.g. mail carrier (postal worker), but where there is a common word with a -man suffix, sometimes -lady may be used as an equivalent, e.g. postman and (sometimes) postlady. Using &quot;lady&quot; in professional job titles which had previously been male preserves fell out of favour with second-wave feminism (lady doctor, lady engineer, lady judge), though lady doctor is sometimes used by a healthcare receptionist when booking an appointment at a group practice health centre so that the situation is clear to the patient. It is still used in some other occupations, to give dignity and express respect to less skilled work such as tea ladies in offices and hospitals, lunch ladies (or dinner ladies) in school canteens, cleaning ladies in private homes and in business premises, and healthcare ladies for female healthcare assistants. 

Both British and American commentators noted the shifting uses of &quot;lady&quot; in the mid-twentieth century. The American journalist William Allen White noted one of the difficulties in his 1946 autobiography. He relates that a woman who had paid a fine for prostitution came to his newspaper to protest, not against the fact that her conviction had been reported, but that the newspaper had referred to her as a &quot;woman&quot; rather than a &quot;lady&quot;. After the incident, White assured his readers, his papers referred to human females as &quot;women&quot;, with the exception of police court characters, who were all &quot;ladies&quot;. The British historian Nancy Mitford wrote an influential essay in 1954, &quot;U vs. non-U&quot;, in which she noted the class distinctions: lower class women strongly preferred to be called &quot;ladies&quot;, while those from higher social backgrounds were content to be identified as &quot;women&quot;. Commenting on the word in 1953, C. S. Lewis wrote that &quot;the guard at Holloway said it was a &quot;ladies&quot;&#x27; prison!&quot; The term &quot;a bag lady&quot; (vagabond) is a euphemism for a woman who has fallen on hard times; a &quot;lady of the night&quot; is a polite term for a prostitute.

In British English, &quot;lady&quot; is often, but not always, simply a courteous synonym for &quot;woman&quot;. Public toilets are often distinguished by signs showing simply &quot;Ladies&quot; or &quot;Gentlemen&quot;. &quot;Lady&quot; can have a formal and respectful quality, being used to describe an elderly woman as &quot;an old lady&quot; or when speaking about a woman to a child (e.g. &quot;Give the money to the lady.&quot;) It remains in use as a counterpart to &quot;gentleman&quot;, in the plural phrase &quot;&quot;, and is generally interchangeable (in a strictly informal sense) with &quot;woman&quot; (as in, &quot;The lady at the store said I could return this item within thirty days&quot;). However, some women, since the rise of second-wave feminism, have objected to the term used in contexts such as the last example, arguing that the term sounds patronising and outdated when used in this way; a man in the same context would not necessarily be referred to as a &quot;gentleman&quot;. One feminist proponent of language reform, Robin Lakoff, in her book &quot;Language and Woman&#x27;s Place&quot; (1975), notably raised the issue of the ways in which &quot;lady&quot; is not used as the counterpart of &quot;gentleman&quot;. It is suggested by academic Elizabeth Reid Boyd that feminist usage of the word &quot;lady&quot; has been reclaimed in the 21st century.

=== British titles ===
Formally, &quot;Lady&quot; is the female counterpart to higher ranks in society, from gentlemen, through knights, to peers of the realm. During the Middle Ages, princesses or daughters of the blood royal were usually known by their first names with &quot;Lady&quot; prefixed, e.g. &quot;The Lady Elizabeth&quot;; since Old English and Middle English did not have a female equivalent to princes or earls or other royals or nobles. Aside from the queen, women of royal and noble status simply carried the title of &quot;Lady&quot;.

As a title of nobility, the uses of &quot;lady&quot; in Britain are parallel to those of &quot;lord&quot;. It is thus a less formal alternative to the full title giving the specific rank, of marchioness, countess, viscountess or baroness, whether as the title of the husband&#x27;s rank by right or courtesy, or as the lady&#x27;s title in her own right. A peeress&#x27;s title is used with the definite article: Lord Morris&#x27;s wife is &quot;the Lady Morris&quot;. A widow&#x27;s title derived from her husband becomes the dowager, e.g. &quot;The Dowager Lady Smith&quot;. In the case of an heir apparent to a peerage using one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles by courtesy, his wife uses his courtesy title in the same way as the wife of a substantive peer, except that the definite article is not used.

The title &quot;Lady&quot; is also used for a woman who is the wife of a Scottish feudal baron or laird, the title &quot;Lady&quot; preceding the name of the barony or lairdship. In the case of younger sons of a duke or marquess, who have the courtesy title &quot;Lord&quot; prefixed to their given and family name, the wife may use &quot;Lady&quot; prefixed to the husband&#x27;s given and family names, e.g. &quot;Lady John Smith&quot;. However, she may not use &quot;Lady&quot; prefixed to her husband&#x27;s surname alone. Neither may she use the title prefixed to her own given name unless entitled to do so by her own birth as the daughter of an earl, marquess or duke. 

The daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls are by courtesy &quot;ladies&quot;; here, that title is prefixed to the given and family name of the lady, e.g. &quot;Lady Jane Smith&quot;, and this is preserved if the lady marries a commoner, e.g. &quot;Mr John and Lady Jane Smith&quot;. &quot;Lady&quot; is also the customary title of the wife of a baronet or knight, but in this case without Christian name: &quot;Lady&quot; with the surname of the husband only, &quot;Sir John and Lady Smith&quot;. When a woman divorces a knight and he marries again, the new wife will be &quot;Lady Smith&quot; while the ex-wife becomes &quot;Jane, Lady Smith&quot; until either her own death or until she remarries. Widows and former wives of knights retain their married style until their death or they remarry. She is also never addressed as &quot;Lady Jane Smith&quot;.

Female members of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle who do not hold a higher style also receive the prefix of &quot;Lady&quot;; here that title is prefixed to the given and family name of the lady, e.g. &quot;Lady Marion Fraser, LT&quot;, with the post nominal LG or LT, respectively, and this is preserved if the lady marries.

==Other meanings==
The special use of the word as a title of the Virgin Mary, usually &quot;Our Lady&quot;, represents the Latin &quot;Domina Nostra&quot;. In Lady Day and Lady Chapel, the word is properly a genitive, representing &quot;hlǣfdigan&quot; &quot;of the Lady&quot;.

The word is also used as a title of the Wiccan Goddess, &quot;The Lady&quot;.

Margaret Thatcher was informally referred to in the same way by many of her political colleagues when Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Her husband was later created a baronet, thus making her &quot;Lady Thatcher&quot; as of right. After she retired, she was given a barony as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire, and was thereafter known as &quot;The Lady Thatcher&quot;.

Elsewhere in the Commonwealth, the word is used in a similar fashion to aristocratic usage in Britain. In Ghana, for example, the consort of the Asantehene of the Ashanti people is known as Lady Julia Osei Tutu. In Nigeria, the Yoruba aristocrats Kofoworola, Lady Ademola and Oyinkansola, Lady Abayomi made use of the title due to their being the wives of British knights.

<doc id="555648" wikidata="Q6680051" url="?curid=555648" title="Lord of Abernethy">
<text>The Lord of Abernethy was from the 12th century to the 14th century the hereditary holder of the church and lands of the Scottish monastery at Abernethy. It gradually evolved alongside the title Abbot of Abernethy, displacing that term in extant sources by the end of the 13th century. It was held by the descendants of Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife.

As Lord Abernethy, it is a subsidiary title of the Dukes of Hamilton and Brandon. The Mormaers and Earls of Fife had enjoyed the privilege of crowning new Kings of Scots. Following the failure of the main MacDuff line, and after the execution of the Stewart Murdoch, Earl of Fife in 1425, the privilege fell back to the second line of MacDuffs, those of Abernethy.

Through them this honour was regarded as passing to the Douglas Earls of Angus, notably at the coronation of James III in 1460 when George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus proclaimed &quot;There! Now that I have set it upon your Grace&#x27;s head, let me see who will be so bold as to move it.&quot;

This continuity has survived to the current era, most notably at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, when the then Lord Abernethy and Angus, Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton bore and presented the Crown of Scotland to the Queen at St. Giles&#x27; Cathedral. Hamilton&#x27;s son the 15th Duke, and the 16th Duke performed similar duties at the opening of Scottish Parliaments since 1999.

==History==
The abbots of Abernethy were descendants of Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife. The abbacy may have been held by Áed (called &quot;Hugo&quot; or &quot;Eggu&quot; and other Latinised forms), son of Gille Míchéil, but the abbacy is first attested when Áed&#x27;s son Orm is confirmed in possession of it by King William of Scotland in the 1170s, in condition for making concessions favorable to the King&#x27;s new monastic establishment at Arbroath Abbey. The title of Abbot disappears in the sources during the abbacy of Laurence, with the title of &quot;dominus&quot; predominating:

* Orm de Abernethy (fl. 1170s)
* Laurence de Abernethy (fl. 1190s)
* Hugh de Abernethy (d. 1291)
* Alexander de Abernethy (d. c. 1315)

Following the death of Alexander Abernethy, the title passed to his daughter Margaret who married John Stewart of Bonkyll, who assumed the title, as well as being granted the forfeited Earldom of Angus.

===Douglas lords of Abernethy===
His granddaughter Margaret Stewart, 3rd Countess of Angus and Lady of Abernethy, had an illegitimate son by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas. In a charter of 1389, Lady Angus transferred the titles of Earl of Angus and the Lordships of Abernethy and Bonkyll to her child.

*George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus, Lord of Abernethy and Bonkyll (1380–1403), upon his betrothal to Princess Mary, daughter of Robert III of Scotland

For further Lords of Abernethy please see:
*Earl of Angus
*Duke of Hamilton

==Baronial title==
Lord of Abernethy or Baron of Abernethy is also a separate, non-peerage title in the Baronage of Scotland, formerly referred to as a feudal barony. 

The status of Lord in the Baronage of Scotland was detached from land ownership by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, which retained the title and dignity. Unlike other titles in the United Kingdom, these baronies can be assigned by grant or sale. 

Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, Lord of Abernethy succeeded to the title in 2008 by assignation.

<doc id="555650" wikidata="Q13600188" url="?curid=555650" title="Conceptual framework">
<text>A conceptual framework is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

== Examples ==
Isaiah Berlin used the metaphor of a &quot;fox&quot; and a &quot;hedgehog&quot; to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world. Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as Dante Alighieri, Blaise Pascal, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Plato, Henrik Ibsen and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, James Joyce, William Shakespeare, Aristotle, Herodotus, Molière, and Honoré de Balzac).

Economists use the conceptual framework of supply and demand to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers. Like many other conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see demand curve). Both political science and economics use principal agent theory as a conceptual framework. The politics-administration dichotomy is a long-standing conceptual framework used in public administration.

All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term &quot;conceptual framework&quot; crosses both scale (large and small theories) and contexts (social science, marketing, applied science, art etc.). The explicit definition of what a conceptual framework is and its application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are beneficial as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of a conceptual framework to deductive, empirical research at the micro- or individual study level. They employ American football plays as a useful metaphor to clarify the meaning of &quot;conceptual framework&quot; (used in the context of a deductive empirical study).

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project&#x27;s goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a &quot;plan of action&quot; tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to &quot;purpose&quot; that makes American football plays such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as &quot;the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project&#x27;s purpose&quot;. Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. Explanation is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal hypothesis of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with explanation.

Explanatory research usually focuses on &quot;why&quot; or &quot;what caused&quot; a phenomenon. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population, and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in U.S. cities.

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified, and line up with a research purpose in the following ways:
* Working hypothesis – exploration or exploratory research
* Pillar questions – exploration or exploratory research
* Descriptive categories – description or descriptive research
* Practical ideal type – analysis (gauging)
* Models of operations research – decision making
* Formal hypothesis – explanation and prediction

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to inductive forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own research design.

Frameworks have also been used to explain conflict theory and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution. Anomalies may exist without adequate &quot;lenses&quot; or &quot;filters&quot; to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.

<doc id="555656" wikidata="Q335412" url="?curid=555656" title="George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore">
<text>George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (; 1580 – 15 April 1632) was an English politician. He achieved domestic political success as a member of parliament and later Secretary of State under King James I. He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between Prince Charles and the Spanish House of Habsburg royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for his position on the Privy Council and declared his Catholicism publicly. He was created Baron Baltimore in the Peerage of Ireland upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in County Longford, Ireland.

Calvert took an interest in the British colonization of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for persecuted Irish and English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.

==Family and early life==

Little is known of the ancestry of the Yorkshire branch of the Calverts. At George Calvert&#x27;s knighting, it was claimed that his family originally came from Flanders (a Dutch-speaking area today across the English Channel in modern Belgium). Calvert&#x27;s father, Leonard of Yorkshire, was a country gentleman who had achieved some prominence as a tenant of Lord Wharton, and was wealthy enough to marry a &quot;gentlewoman&quot; of a noble line, Alicia or Alice Crossland (sometimes spelt &quot;Crosland&quot;). Leonard established his family on the estate of the later-built Kiplin Hall, near Catterick in Yorkshire. George Calvert was born at Kiplin in late 1579. His mother Alicia/Alice died on 28 November 1587, when he was eight years old. His father then married Grace Crossland (sometimes spelt: &quot;Crosland&quot;), Alicia&#x27;s first cousin.

In 1569, Sir Thomas Gargrave had described Richmond as a territory where all gentlemen were &quot;evil in religion&quot;, by which he meant predominately Roman Catholic; it appears Leonard Calvert was no exception. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, continuing the changes wrought earlier in the century by her father King Henry VIII which made the monarch the supreme authority of the Christian Church in England, continuing the Protestant Reformation from the continent of Europe, with the political, spiritual and temporal separation from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope/Papacy in Rome, the Royal Government exerted authority over the matters of religious faith, practices and the Church. Acts mandating compulsory religious uniformity were enacted by Parliament and enforced through penal laws. The Acts of Supremacy and the Uniformity Act of 1559 also included an oath of allegiance to the Queen and an implicit denial of the Pope&#x27;s (then Pope Paul IV) authority over the English Church. This oath was required of any subject who wished to hold high office, attend university, or take advantage of opportunities controlled by the state (king/kingdom).

The Calvert household suffered the intrusion of the Elizabethan-era religious laws. From the year of George&#x27;s birth onward, his father, Leonard Calvert, was subjected to repeated harassment by the Yorkshire authorities, who in 1580 extracted a promise of conformity from him, compelling his attendance at the Church of England services. In 1592, when George was twelve, the authorities denounced one of his tutors for teaching &quot;from a popish primer&quot; and instructed Leonard and Grace to send George and his brother Christopher to a Protestant tutor and, if necessary, to present the children before the commission &quot;once a month to see how they perfect in learning&quot;. As a result, the boys were sent to a Protestant tutor called Fowberry at Bilton. The senior Calvert had to give a &quot;bond of conformity&quot;; he was banned from employing any Catholic servants and forced to purchase an English Bible, which was to &quot;lie open in his house for everyone to read&quot;.

In 1593, records show that Grace Calvert was committed to the custody of a &quot;pursuivant&quot;, an official responsible for identifying and persecuting Catholics, and in 1604 she was described as the &quot;wife of Leonard Calvert of Kipling, non-communicant at Easter last&quot;.

George Calvert went up to Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, where he studied foreign languages and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1597. As the oath of allegiance was compulsory after the age of sixteen, he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert&#x27;s early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn for three years.

==Marriage and family==
In November 1604 he married Anne Mynne (or Mayne), daughter of George Mynne (b. 14 February 1530) of Hertingfordbury and his wife Elizabeth Wroth, daughter of Sir Thomas Wroth. George Mynne was the son of John Mynne (d.14 December 1542), Auditor of the Exchequer, Clerk to the Surveyor General and Master of the Woods to Henry VIII, and the grandson of Nicholas Mynne of Little Francham and London (d. 1530). George Mynne was also a first cousin of Nicholas Mynn. George Mynne&#x27;s mother was Alice (d. c. 1560), daughter of William Standish, who married secondly Francis Southwell. 

The wedding was a Protestant Church of England ceremony at St. Peter&#x27;s, Cornhill, Middlesex, where his address was registered as St. Martin in the Fields. His children, including his eldest son and heir Cecil, who was born in the winter of 1605–06, were all baptised in the Church of England. When Anne died on 8 August 1622, she was buried at Calvert&#x27;s local Protestant parish church, St. Martin-in-the-Fields.

Calvert had a total of twelve children: Cecil, who succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Baltimore, Leonard, Anne, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Grace, who married Sir Robert Talbot, 2nd Baronet of Carton, County Kildare, Francis, George, Helen, Henry, John (died young), and Philip.

==Political success==
Calvert named his son &quot;Cecilius&quot; (1605–1675) for Sir Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury (1563–1612), spymaster to Queen Elizabeth, whom Calvert had met during an extended trip to the European mainland between 1601 and 1603, after which he became known as a specialist in foreign affairs. Calvert carried a packet for Cecilius from Paris, and so entered the service of the principal engineer of King James VI of Scotland&#x27;s succession to the English throne in 1603 (when he also assumed the title of King James I of England).

King James rewarded Robert Cecil, whom he made a Privy Councillor and secretary of state, with the granting of the title of Earl of Salisbury in 1605 and Lord High Treasurer in 1608, making him the most powerful man at the royal court. As Cecil rose, Calvert rose with him. Calvert&#x27;s foreign languages, legal training, and discretion made him an invaluable aide to Robert Cecil who, no lover of Catholics, seems to have accepted Calvert&#x27;s conformity as beyond question. Working at the centre of court politics, Calvert exploited his influence by selling favours, an accepted practice for the times. 

Calvert accumulated a number of small offices, honours, and sinecures. In August 1605, he attended the King at Oxford, and received an honorary master-of-arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the Duke of Lennox, the earls of Oxford and Northumberland, and Cecilius received degrees. Given the prestige of the other graduates, Calvert&#x27;s was the last awarded, but his presence in such company signalled his growing stature.

In 1606 the king made Calvert &quot;clerk of the Crown&quot; and &quot;Assizes in Connaught&quot;, County Clare, Ireland, his first royal appointment. In 1609, James appointed him a &quot;clerk of the Signet office&quot;, a post which required the preparation of documents for the royal signature and brought Calvert into close contact with the king. Calvert also served in James&#x27;s First Parliament as a member for the borough of Bossiney, in the county of Cornwall, installed there by Cecil to support his policies. 

In 1610, Calvert was appointed a &quot;clerk of the Privy Council&quot;. Each of these positions would have required an oath of allegiance.

With Robert Cecil&#x27;s support, George Calvert came into his own as an adviser and supporter of King James. In 1610 and 1611, Calvert undertook missions to the continent on behalf of the King, visiting a number of embassies in Paris, Holland, and the Duchy of Cleves, and acting as an ambassador to the French Royal Court during the coronation of King Louis XIII (1601–1643) in 1610. A correspondent from France reported that Calvert gave &quot;everyone great contentment with his discreet conversation.&quot; 

In 1615, James sent him to the continental Electorate of the Palatinate (German) in the Holy Roman Empire, whose impoverished elector, Frederick V, Elector Palatine (1596–1632), had married James&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth of Bohemia (1596–1662) in 1613. Calvert had to convey the King&#x27;s disapproval that Elizabeth, for lack of money, had given away expensive jewels to a gentlewoman leaving her employ. Elector Frederick&#x27;s decision in 1619 to accept the throne of Bohemia triggered a war with the powerful neighbouring Habsburg dynasty of Austria to the southwest in Vienna, which James attempted to end through a proposed alliance with the Kingdom of Spain.

In 1611, James employed Calvert to research and transcribe his tract against the Dutch Protestant theologian Conrad Vorstius (1569–1622). The following year, Cecil died, and Calvert acted as one of the four executors of his will. The king&#x27;s favourite, Sir Robert Carr, first Earl of Somerset (1587–1645), Viscount Rochester, assumed the duties of secretary of state and recruited Calvert to assist with foreign policy, in particular the Latin and Spanish correspondence. 

Carr, soon raised to the earldom of Somerset, was not a success in the job, and fell from favour partly as a result of the murder of Thomas Overbury (1581–1613), to which Carr&#x27;s wife Frances, the former Countess of Essex and later Somerset (1590–1632), pleaded guilty in 1615. Carr&#x27;s place as James&#x27;s principal favourite was now taken by the handsome George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592–1628), with whom James was said to have been infatuated.

In 1613 the King commissioned Calvert to investigate Roman Catholic grievances in Ireland, along with Sir Humphrey Wynch (1555–1625), Sir Charles Cornwallis (died 1629) and Sir Roger Wilbraham (1553–1616). The commission spent almost four months in Ireland, and its final report, partly drafted by Calvert, concluded that religious conformity should be enforced more strictly in Ireland, Catholic schools be suppressed, and bad priests removed and punished. The King resolved not to reconvene the Parliament of Ireland until the Catholics &quot;shall be better disciplined&quot;. In 1616 James endowed Calvert with the manor of Danby Wiske in Yorkshire, which brought him into contact with Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1593–1641), who became his closest friend and political ally. Calvert was now wealthy enough to buy the Kiplin Hall estate in his home parish. (Today, the University of Maryland operates a research centre there, while the main building is a house museum owned by the Kiplin Hall Trust.) In 1617 his social status received a further boost when he was knighted, and then became Sir George Calvert.

In 1619, Calvert completed his rise to power when James appointed him as one of the two principal secretaries of state. This followed the dismissal of Sir Thomas Lake (1567–1630) due to scandals, including his wife&#x27;s indiscretions with state secrets. Not emerging as a candidate until the end of the selection process, Calvert&#x27;s appointment surprised him and most observers. Assuming he owed his promotion to the king&#x27;s increasingly powerful favourite George Villiers (1592–1628) (later first Duke of Buckingham), he sent him a great jewel as a token of thanks. Villiers returned the jewel, saying he had had nothing to do with the matter. Calvert&#x27;s personal fortune was secured when he was additionally appointed a &quot;commissioner of the treasury&quot; with a pension of £1,000 and a subsidy on imported raw silk, which would later be converted to another £1,000 pension.

==Secretary of State==
In Parliament, a political crisis developed over the king&#x27;s policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, as part of a proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador&#x27;s court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife&#x27;s death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.

King James rewarded Calvert in 1623 for his loyalty by granting him a estate in County Longford, in the Irish province of Leinster, where his seat was known as the &quot;Manor of Baltimore&quot;. The name Baltimore is an anglicisation of the Irish Baile an Tí Mhóir meaning &quot;town of the big house&quot;. Calvert was increasingly isolated from court circles as the Prince of Wales, (heir to the throne) and George Villiers wrested control of policy from the ageing James. Without consulting the diplomatically astute Calvert, the prince and the duke travelled to Spain to negotiate the Spanish marriage for themselves, with disastrous results. Instead of securing an alliance, the visit provoked hostility between the two courts which quickly led to war. In a reversal of policy, Buckingham dismissed the treaties with Spain, summoned a war council, and sought a French marriage for the Prince of Wales.

==Resignation and conversion to Catholicism==
As the chief parliamentary spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown when he was reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations for the sale of his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.

No disgrace was attached to Calvert&#x27;s departure from office: the King, to whom he had always remained personally loyal, confirmed his place on the Privy Council and appointed him Baron Baltimore, of Baltimore, County Longford, one of his Irish manors. Immediately after Calvert resigned, he converted to Roman Catholicism.

The connection between Calvert&#x27;s resignation and his conversion to Roman Catholicism was a complex one. George Cottington, a former employee of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert&#x27;s conversion had been in progress a long time before it was made public. George Abbot (1562–1633), the reigning Archbishop of Canterbury (and ecclesiastical head of the independent Church of England), reported that political opposition to Calvert, combined with his loss of office, had &quot;made him discontented and, as the saying is, &quot;Desperatio facit monachum&quot;, so hee apparently did turne papist, which hee now professeth, this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way [sic]&quot;. Godfrey Goodman, the Bishop of Gloucester, later claimed Calvert had been a secret Catholic all along (&quot;infinitely addicted to the Catholic faith&quot;), which explained his support for lenient policies towards Catholics and for the Spanish match.

No one had questioned Calvert&#x27;s conformity at the time, and if he had been secretly Catholic, he had hidden it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation &quot;Propaganda Fide&quot; in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).

When King James I died in March 1625, his successor Charles I maintained Calvert&#x27;s barony but not his previous place on the Privy Council. Calvert then turned his attention to his Irish estates and his overseas investments. He was not entirely forgotten at court. After Buckingham&#x27;s dabblings in wars against Spain and France had ended in failure, he recalled Baltimore to court, and for a while may have considered employing him in the peace negotiations with Spain. Though nothing came of Baltimore&#x27;s recall, he renewed his rights over the silk-import duties, which had lapsed with the death of James I, and secured Charles&#x27; blessing for his venture in the &quot;New Found Land&quot;.

==Colony of Avalon (Newfoundland)==
Calvert had long maintained an interest in the exploration and settlement of the New World, beginning with his investment of twenty-five pounds in the second Virginia Company in 1609, and a few months later a more substantial sum in the East India Company, which he increased in 1614. In 1620, Calvert purchased a tract of land in Newfoundland from Sir William Vaughan (1575–1641), a Welsh writer and colonial investor, who had earlier failed to establish a colony on the large subarctic island off the eastern coast of North America. He named the area of the peninsula as Avalon, after the legendary spot where Christianity was supposedly introduced to Roman Britain in ancient times. The plantation lay on what is now called the Avalon Peninsula and included the fishing station at &quot;Ferryland&quot;. Calvert almost certainly had a fishery project in mind at this stage.

Calvert dispatched Captain Edward Wynne and a group of Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, &quot;It is better and not so cold as England,&quot; and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne&#x27;s reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: &quot;The land on which our Governor [Calvert and/or Wynne] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, I think there is no better in many parts of England&quot;; but he added ominously that Ferryland was &quot;the coldest harbour in the land&quot;. Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.

The settlement appeared to be progressing so well that in January 1623, Calvert obtained a concession from King James for the whole of Newfoundland, though the grant was soon reduced to cover only the southeastern Avalon peninsula, owing to competing claims from other English colonists. The final Charter constituted the province as a &quot;county palatinate&quot;, officially titled the &quot;Province of Avalon&quot;, under Calvert&#x27;s personal rule.

After resigning the Royal secretariat of state in 1625, the new Baron Baltimore made clear his intention to visit the colony: &quot;I intend shortly,&quot; he wrote in March, &quot;God willing, a journey for Newfoundland to visit a plantation which I began there some few years since.&quot; His plans were disrupted by the death of King James I, and by the crackdown on Catholics with which King Charles I began his reign to appease his opponents. The new King required all privy councillors to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance; and since Baltimore, as a Catholic, had to refuse, he was obliged to step down from that cherished office. Given the new religious and political climate, and perhaps also to escape a serious outbreak of plague in England, Baltimore moved to his estates in Ireland. His expedition to Newfoundland had set sail without him in late May 1625 under Sir Arthur Aston, who became the new provincial Governor of Avalon.

A reference by David Rothe, bishop of Ossory in Ireland, to a &quot;Joane [also recorded as Jane] Baltimore now wife&quot; of Calvert, reveals that Baltimore had recently remarried.

From the time of his conversion in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock&#x27;s recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock&#x27;s own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore&#x27;s: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.

==Baltimore in Avalon==
Baltimore was determined to visit his colony in person. In May 1626, he wrote to Wentworth:

Aston&#x27;s return to England in late 1626, along with all the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, arriving on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.

In 1628 he sailed again for Newfoundland, this time with his second wife Jane, and most of his children, and 40 more settlers, to officially take over as Proprietary Governor of Avalon. He and his family moved into the house at Ferryland built by Wynne, a sizeable structure for the time, by colonial standards, and the only one in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community.

Matters connected to religion were to bedevil Baltimore&#x27;s stay in &quot;this remote part of the worlde where I have planted my selfe &quot;. He sailed at a time when English military preparations were underway to relieve the Huguenots at La Rochelle. He was dismayed to find that the war with France had spread to Newfoundland, and that he had to spend most of his time fighting off French attacks on English fishing fleets with his own ships the &quot;Dove&quot; and the &quot;Ark&quot;. As he wrote to Buckingham, &quot;I came to builde, and sett, and sowe, but I am falne to fighting with Frenchmen [sic]&quot;. His settlers were so successful against the French that they captured several ships, which they escorted back to England to help with the war effort. Baltimore was granted the loan of one of the ships to aid in his defence of the colony, as well as a share of the prize money.

Adopting a policy of free religious worship in the colony, Baltimore allowed the Catholics to worship in one part of his house and the Protestants in another. This novel arrangement proved too much for the resident Anglican priest, Erasmus Stourton—&quot;that knave Stourton&quot;, as Baltimore referred to him—who, after altercations with Baltimore, was placed on a ship for England, where he lost no time in reporting Baltimore&#x27;s practices to the authorities, complaining that the Catholic priests Smith and Hackett said mass every Sunday and &quot;doe use all other ceremonies of the church of Rome in as ample a manner as tis used in Spayne [sic]&quot;. and that Baltimore had the son of a Protestant forcibly baptised as a Catholic. Although Stourton&#x27;s complaints were investigated by the Privy Council, due to Baltimore&#x27;s support in high places the case was dismissed.

Baltimore had become disenchanted with conditions in &quot;this wofull country&quot;, and he wrote to his old acquaintances in England lamenting his troubles. The final blow to his hopes was dealt by the Newfoundland winter of 1628–9, which did not release its grip until May. Like others before them, the residents of Avalon suffered terribly from the cold and from malnutrition. Nine or ten of Baltimore&#x27;s company died that winter, and with half the settlers ill at one time, his house had to be turned into a hospital. The sea froze over, and nothing would grow before May. &quot;Tis not terra Christianorum&quot;, Baltimore wrote to Wentworth. He confessed to the king: &quot;I have found...by too deare bought experience [that which other men] always concealed from me...that there is a sad face of wynter upon all this land&quot;.

Baltimore solicited a new charter from the king. To found an alternative colony in a less hostile climate further south, he requested &quot;a precinct&quot; in Virginia, where he could grow tobacco. He wrote to his friends Francis Cottington and Thomas Wentworth enlisting their support for this new proposal, admitting the impression his abandonment of Avalon might make in England: &quot;I shall rayse a great deal of talke and discourse and be censured by most men of giddiness and levity [sic]&quot;. The king, perhaps guided by Baltimore&#x27;s friends at court, replied expressing concern for Baltimore&#x27;s health and gently advising him to forget colonial schemes and return to England, where he would be treated with every respect: &quot;Men of your condition and breeding are fitter for other imployments than the framing of new plantations, which commonly have rugged &amp; laborious beginnings, and require much greater meanes, in managing them, than usually the power of one private subject can reach unto&quot;.

Baltimore sent his children home to England in August. By the time the king&#x27;s letter reached Avalon, he had departed with his wife and servants for Virginia.

==Attempt to found a Southern colony==
In late September or October 1629, Baltimore arrived in Jamestown, where the Virginians, who suspected him of designs on some of their territory and vehemently opposed Catholicism, gave him a cool welcome. They gave him the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, which he refused to take, so they ordered him to leave. After no more than a few weeks in the colony, Baltimore left for England to pursue the new charter, leaving his wife and servants behind. In early 1630 he procured a ship to fetch them, but it foundered off the Irish coast, and his wife drowned. Baltimore described himself the following year as &quot;a long time myself a Man of Sorrows&quot;.

Baltimore spent the last two years of his life constantly lobbying for his new charter, though the obstacles proved difficult. The Virginians, led by William Claiborne, who sailed to England to make the case, campaigned aggressively against the separate colonising of the Chesapeake, claiming they possessed the rights to that area. Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the bubonic plague, which he survived. He wrote to Wentworth: &quot;Blessed be God for it who hath preserved me now from shipwreck, hunger, scurvy and pestilence...&quot;

His health declining, Baltimore&#x27;s persistence over the charter finally paid off in 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries to the north of the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.

==Legacy==
In his will, written the day before he died, Baltimore beseeched his friends Wentworth and Cottington to act as guardians and supervisors to his first son Cecil, who inherited the title of Lord Baltimore and the imminent grant of Maryland. Baltimore&#x27;s two colonies in the New World continued under the proprietorship of his family. Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish, was expropriated by Sir David Kirke, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754. Although Baltimore&#x27;s failed Avalon venture marked the end of an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.

Maryland became a prime tobacco exporting colony in the mid-Atlantic and, for a time, a refuge for Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped. Under the rule of the Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.

One hundred and forty years after its first settlement, Maryland joined twelve other British colonies along the Atlantic coast in declaring their independence from British rule and the right to freedom of religion for all citizens in the new United States.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honour.

<text>A protomartyr (Koine Greek, &quot;prôtos&quot; &#x27;first&#x27; + &quot;mártus&quot; &#x27;martyr&#x27;) is the first Christian martyr in a country or among a particular group, such as a religious order. Similarly, the phrase the Protomartyr (with no other qualification of country or region) can mean Saint Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian Church.
Saint Thecla the Protomartyr, the first female martyr of the Christian Church, is known as &quot;apostle and protomartyr among women&quot;.

<text>α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) or alpha-2-macroglobulin is a large (720 KDa) plasma protein found in the blood. It is mainly produced by the liver, and also locally synthesized by macrophages, fibroblasts, and adrenocortical cells. In humans it is encoded by the &quot;A2M&quot; gene.

α2-Macroglobulin acts as an antiprotease and is able to inactivate an enormous variety of proteinases. It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of coagulation by inhibiting thrombin. α2-macroglobulin may act as a carrier protein because it also binds to numerous growth factors and cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, TGF-β, insulin, and IL-1β.

No specific deficiency with associated disease has been recognized, and no disease state is attributed to low concentrations of α2-macroglobulin. The concentration of α2-macroglobulin rises 10-fold or more in the nephrotic syndrome when other lower molecular weight proteins are lost in the urine. The loss of α2-macroglobulin into urine is prevented by its large size. The net result is that α2-macroglobulin reaches serum levels equal to or greater than those of albumin in the nephrotic syndrome, which has the effect of maintaining oncotic pressure.

== Structure ==
Human α2-macroglobulin is composed of four identical subunits bound together by -S-S- bonds. In addition to tetrameric forms of α2-macroglobulin, dimeric, and more recently monomeric αM protease inhibitors have been identified.

Each monomer of human α2-macroglobulin is composed of several functional domains, including macroglobulin domains, a thiol ester-containing domain and a receptor-binding domain. Overall, α2-macroglobulin is the largest major nonimmunoglobulin protein in human plasma.

The amino acid sequence of α2-macroglobulin has been shown to be 71% the same as that of the pregnancy zone protein (PZP; also known as pregnancy-associated α2-glycoprotein).

==Function==
The α-macroglobulin (αM) family of proteins includes protease inhibitors, typified by the human tetrameric α2-macroglobulin (α2M); they belong to the MEROPS proteinase inhibitor family I39, clan IL. These protease inhibitors share several defining properties, which include (1) the ability to inhibit proteases from all catalytic classes, (2) the presence of a &#x27;bait region&#x27; (also known as a sequence of amino acids in an α2-macroglobulin molecule, or a homologous protein, that contains scissile peptide bonds for those proteinases that it inhibits) and a thiol ester, (3) a similar protease inhibitory mechanism and (4) the inactivation of the inhibitory capacity by reaction of the thiol ester with small primary amines. αM protease inhibitors inhibit by steric hindrance. The mechanism involves protease cleavage of the bait region, a segment of the αM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, which initiates a conformational change such that the αM collapses about the protease. In the resulting αM-protease complex, the active site of the protease is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur as a consequence of bait region cleavage, namely (1) the h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester becomes highly reactive and (2) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD). RBD exposure allows the αM protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation. Tetrameric, dimeric, and, more recently, monomeric αM protease inhibitors have been identified.

α2-Macroglobulin is able to inactivate an enormous variety of proteinases (including serine-, cysteine-, aspartic- and metalloproteinases). It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of coagulation by inhibiting thrombin. α2-Macroglobulin has in its structure a 35 amino acid &quot;bait&quot; region. Proteinases binding and cleaving the bait region become bound to α2M. The proteinase–α2M complex is recognised by macrophage receptors and cleared from the system.

α2-Macroglobulin is known to bind zinc, as well as copper in plasma, even more strongly than albumin, and such it is also known as transcuprein. 10 to 15% of copper in human plasma is chelated by α2-macroglobulin.

==Disease==
α2-Macroglobulin levels are increased when the serum albumin levels are low, which is most commonly seen in nephrotic syndrome, a condition wherein the kidneys start to leak out some of the smaller blood proteins. Because of its size, α2-macroglobulin is retained in the bloodstream. Increased production of all proteins means α2-macroglobulin concentration increases. This increase has little adverse effect on the health but is used as a diagnostic clue.

An increase in α2-Macroglobulin with normal amount of albumin mainly indicates acute and/or chronic inflammation.

A common variant (29.5%) (polymorphism) of α2-macroglobulin leads to increased risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

α2-Macroglobulin binds to and removes the active forms of the gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) from the circulation via scavenger receptors on the phagocytes.

<text>The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE) was an international union that represented workers in the United States and Canada. PACE was founded on January 4, 1999, by the merger of the United Paperworkers&#x27; International Union with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union.

Like all labor unions, PACE fought for rights, wage raises, and improvement of working conditions for workers in such fields as: the paper industry, the oil industry, chemicals, nuclear materials, pharmaceuticals, automobile parts, motorcycles, tissues, toys, cement, corn sugar, etc.

On January 11, 2005, the union announced a merger with the United Steel Workers of America. The new union, with 860,000 active members in the United States and Canada,was the largest industrial labor union in North America. The union is known as the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied-Industrial and Service Workers International Union, abbreviated as the &quot;United Steelworkers&quot; or by the acronym USW.

Throughout its existence, the union was led by president Boyd Young.

<text>Capitol Hill is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., located in both Northeast and Southeast D.C. It is bounded by 14th Street SE &amp; NE, F Street NE, Southeast Boulevard SE, and South Capitol Street SE. Dominated by the United States Capitol, which sits on the highest point of Capitol Hill, it is one of the oldest historic districts in Washington. The neighborhood has a high concentration of rowhouses, largely dating from the 19th century. Home to around 35,000 people in just under , Capitol Hill is also one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Washington. The name &quot;Capitol Hill&quot; is frequently used as a metonym for the U.S. Congress.

Capitol Hill is famed as a center of the United States government, home to numerous important institutions including the U.S. Congress, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and more. Apart from government, the neighborhood is largely residential, but maintains notable commercial hubs along Pennsylvania Avenue, such as Eastern Market and Barracks Row.

==History ==
===Eighteenth century===

Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant selected the location of the United States Capitol (the &quot;Congress House&quot;) in his 1791 design for the federal capital city (see: L&#x27;Enfant Plan). The building would be the symbolic center of his plan. He referred to the hill chosen as the site of the future Congress House as &quot;Jenkins Hill&quot; or &quot;Jenkins Heights&quot;.

However, the tract of land had for many years belonged to the Carroll family and was noted in their records of ownership as &quot;Rome&quot;. While a man named Thomas Jenkins had once pastured some livestock at the site of the Capitol (and thus his name was associated with the site), artist John Trumbull, who would paint several murals inside the Capitol&#x27;s rotunda, reported in 1791 that the site was covered with a thick wood, making it an unlikely place for livestock to graze. Research published in 2004 by the Capitol Hill Historical Society showed that Jenkins&#x27; land was seven blocks east of the site of the Capitol and that L&#x27;Enfant was likely to have given Jenkins&#x27; name to the general location.

While serving in 1793 as President George Washington&#x27;s secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson named Capitol Hill, invoking the famous Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome. However, the connection between the two is not completely clear.

The neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations, the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer. The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress. In the early years of the Republic, few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city. Instead, most preferred to live in boarding houses within walking distance of the Capitol.

In 1799, the Washington Navy Yard was established on the banks of the Anacostia River, providing jobs to craftsmen who built and repaired ships. Many of the craftsmen who were employed both at the Navy Yard and in the construction of the Capitol chose to live within walking distance, to the east of the Capitol and the north of the Navy Yard. They became the original residential population of the neighborhood.

===Nineteenth century===

In 1801, Thomas Jefferson, who was at the time President of the United States, selected the location of the Marine Barracks, which had to be within marching distance of both the Capitol and the White House, near the Washington Navy Yard. By 1810, shops, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and churches were flourishing in the area.

The Civil War resulted in more construction in the Capitol Hill area, including the building of hospitals. Construction of new houses continued in the 1870s and 1880s. The neighborhood began to divide along racial and economic class lines.
Electricity, piped water, and plumbing were introduced in the 1890s, and were first available in the downtown areas of the District of Columbia, including Capitol Hill. There was a real estate development boom between 1890 and 1910 as the Capitol Hill area became one of the first neighborhoods having these modern conveniences.

===Twentieth century===

In 1976, the Capitol Hill Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the largest historic districts in the United States. The boundaries of the historic district are irregular, extending southward from F Street NE, as far east as 14th Street, as far west as South Capitol Street, and with a southern limit marked chiefly by Virginia Avenue but including some territory as far south as M Street SE. It includes buildings from the Federal period (1800 to 1820) through 1919, but most of the buildings are late Victorian.

Capitol Hill has remained a fairly stable middle-class neighborhood throughout its existence. It suffered a period of economic decline and rising crime in the mid-20th century but gradually recovered. During the so-called &quot;crack epidemic&quot; of the 1980s, its fringes were often affected. Beginning in the 1990s, the neighborhood has undergone intense gentrification.

==Landmarks==

Capitol Hill&#x27;s landmarks include not only the United States Capitol, but also the Senate and House office buildings, the Supreme Court building, the Library of Congress, the Marine Barracks, the Washington Navy Yard, and Congressional Cemetery, which are collectively part of the Capitol Complex.

Also, the Folger Shakespeare Library is located in Capitol Hill. It is a research library and museum that houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of material related to English writer William Shakespeare and third-largest collection of English books printed before 1641. The Folger Library houses a large museum and also operates the Folger Theatre, which is known for being a leading interpreter of Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

Capitol Hill is, however, largely a residential neighborhood composed predominantly of rowhouses of different stylistic varieties and periods. Side by side exist early 19th century manor houses, Federal townhouses, small frame dwellings, ornate Italianate bracketed houses, and the late 19th century press brick rowhouses with their often whimsical decorative elements combining Richardsonian Romanesque, Queen Anne, and Eastlakian motifs.

In the 1990s, gentrification and the booming economy of the District of Columbia meant that the neighborhood&#x27;s non-historic and obsolete buildings began to be replaced. New buildings, which have to comply with height limits and other restrictions, are often done in a decorative modernist style, many by Amy Weinstein, whose designs feature polychrome brickwork set in patterned relief.

The main retail corridor of Capitol Hill is Pennsylvania Avenue, a lively commercial street with shops, restaurants and bars. Eastern Market is an 1873 public market on 7th Street SE, where vendors sell fresh meat and produce in indoor stalls and at outdoor farmers&#x27; stands. It is also the site of an outdoor flea market every weekend. After a major fire gutted the main market building on April 30, 2007, it underwent restoration and reopened on June 26, 2009. One of the most beloved stores, Fragers Hardware, has been based on Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly 100 years before it suffered a fire similar in destructiveness to the Eastern Market fire. It has successfully rebuilt on the same location.

Barracks Row at 8th Street SE, named because of its proximity to the U.S. Marine Barracks, is one of the city&#x27;s oldest commercial corridors. It dates to the late 18th century and has recently been revitalized. Barracks Row is located immediately south of Eastern Market, which is a public market dating back to 1871. The Eastern Market and Barracks Row area have many restaurants and shops. This area is the oldest commercial district in the city, in part due to its proximity to the Washington Navy Yard.

A new addition to Capitol Hill is a community center named Hill Center. Hill Center is housed in the restored Old Naval Hospital at the corner of 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. The rehabilitation of the Old Naval Hospital combines the restoration of a historically significant landmark with the cutting-edge technologies of modern &quot;green&quot; architecture. Hill Center is a vibrant new home for cultural, educational, and civic life on Capitol Hill.

===Parks===

The Capitol Hill neighborhood is home to many parks and squares. Lincoln Park is located immediately east of the U.S. Capitol on East Capitol Street. It is home to Thomas Ball&#x27;s controversial Emancipation Memorial as well as Robert Berks&#x27; statue of Mary McLeod Bethune. At the intersection between Maryland Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue on the northern part of the neighborhood is Stanton Park. The park is named after Edwin Stanton, who was U.S. Secretary of War during the American Civil War. 

Located immediately south of the U.S. Capitol is Spirit of Justice Park, which is separated into two identically sized sections by South Capitol Street. Southeast of this park is Folger Park, which was named after former Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger. At the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and North Carolina Avenue is Seward Square. Since those two roads intersect diagonally in the middle of the square, Sward Square is divided into four triangular sections. A couple blocks immediately south of this square is the location of Marion Park. This park goes by the name &quot;Turtle Park&quot; because of a large cement turtle in its playground. On the southern edge of the neighborhood is Garfield Park, named after President James Garfield.

==Education==

There are multiple schools within the boundaries, including District of Columbia Public Schools elementary schools (Tyler Elementary School, Brent Elementary School, Watkins Elementary School, Maury Elementary School, Peabody Elementary School, and Payne Elementary School). 

St. Peter&#x27;s School on Capitol Hill, the only Catholic school, Capitol Hill Day School, Stuart-Hobson Middle School, Elliot-Hine Jr. High School, and many others.

Eastern High School was originally founded in 1890 as Capitol Hill High School. Its current collegiate Gothic campus was built in 1923.

<doc id="555681" wikidata="Q223176" url="?curid=555681" title="Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink">
<text>Jerrel Floyd &quot;Jimmy&quot; Hasselbaink ( ; born 27 March 1972) is a Dutch professional football manager and former player.

Born in Suriname, he and his family would later move to the Dutch city of Zaandam where he first played football, initially as a goalkeeper, later transitioning to the role of a right winger and finally a forward. He began his senior career with Telstar and AZ Alkmaar before leaving the Netherlands for Portuguese club Campomaiorense in August 1995. He joined Boavista the following year and won the Taça de Portugal with the club in 1997. He was signed by English side Leeds United for a £2 million fee before the 1997–98 season, where he established himself as a prolific goalscorer and went on to win the Premier League Golden Boot award in 1999. He was sold on to Spanish club Atlético Madrid for £10 million the same year, reaching the final of the Copa del Rey despite the club also suffering relegation from La Liga.

Hasselbaink returned to the Premier League with Chelsea for a club record £15 million fee in May 2000, where he once again led the league in scoring during his first season, earning him a second Premier League Golden Boot. He also played in the 2002 FA Cup Final and helped Chelsea to a career-high and then club-record second-place Premier League finish in 2003–04. He moved to Middlesbrough on a free transfer in July 2004 and played in the final of the UEFA Cup in 2006. After being released at the end of the previous season, he signed with Charlton Athletic in July 2006 before joining Cardiff City in August 2007. He played on the losing side in the 2008 FA Cup Final before retiring from play at the end of the season. He also scored nine goals in 23 matches during a four-year international career for the Netherlands national team, appearing at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

In May 2013, he was appointed manager of Royal Antwerp in the Belgian Second Division, where he stayed for one season. In November 2014, he was hired by Burton Albion in England, and in his first season, he led them to their first-ever promotion to League One as champions of League Two. In December 2015, he was appointed manager of Queens Park Rangers in the Championship. He lasted 11 months in the job until he was dismissed in November 2016. From September 2017 to April 2018, he managed League One club Northampton Town. On New Year&#x27;s Day 2021, he returned to Burton Albion as manager for a second spell, remaining until he resigned in September 2022.

==Club career==
===Netherlands===
Hasselbaink was born on 27 March 1972 in Paramaribo, Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the youngest of six children. At the age of three in 1975, Hasselbaink was run over by a moped, which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a street gang as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release, he joined the youth team at DWS, but he was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a gang member, and had disciplinary issues at the club due to his persistent lateness. He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.

He began training with AZ Alkmaar, where his brother Carlos was playing and impressed enough to win a professional contract. However, Head coach Henk Wullems opted not to renew his contract in 1993, despite Hasselbaink making 46 appearances for the club. He had an unsuccessful trial with FC Eindhoven, and after failing to agree terms with PEC Zwolle he instead spent the 1993–94 season training with HFC Haarlem. He then played amateur football for Neerlandia whilst he looked abroad for a professional contract, spending time in Austria with Admira Wacker.

===Portugal===
Hasselbaink signed for newly promoted Portuguese Primeira Divisão side Campomaiorense in August 1995 after impressing trainer Manuel Fernandes on a trial. The chairman wanted to keep his signing a secret and so told the press that he had signed a player called &quot;Jimmy&quot;, but after his signing was revealed the name stuck and he was known as Jimmy rather than Jerrel for the rest of his career. He failed to score in his first four games and missed a penalty in his fifth game after insisting on taking the penalty ahead of regular taker Stanimir Stoilov, however, he made amends for the miss later in the game by scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Gil Vicente. The small club could not survive in the top flight and were relegated in the 1995–96 season.

Hasselbaink was signed by Boavista for a €300,000 fee in summer 1996. The 1996–97 season was chaotic for the club, as the chairman dismissed two managers, Zoran Filipović and João Alves, before ending the campaign with Rui Casaca. As a result, the &quot;Panthers&quot; only managed a seventh-place finish, but they ended the campaign on a high note by winning the Taça de Portugal. Hasselbaink had a good season individually, finishing as the league&#x27;s second-highest scorer behind Porto&#x27;s Mário Jardel. He scored his first professional hat-trick at the club in a 3–1 victory over Marítimo at the Estádio do Bessa; he later scored a hat-trick in a 7–0 win over Gil Vicente, as did teammate Nuno Gomes. Though head coach Casaca left Hasselbaink on the bench due to his arranged transfer to Leeds, Hasselbaink entered the final of the Taça de Portugal as a late substitute for Erwin Sánchez as Boavista held on to a 3–2 win over Benfica.

===Leeds United===
Leeds United manager George Graham signed Hasselbaink in the summer of 1997 for a fee of £2 million. He scored on his Premier League debut in a 1–1 draw with Arsenal at Elland Road on 9 August, though initially he struggled to adapt to the pace of the English game. He scored only five league goals before Christmas but ended the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions following a strong second half of the season.

The following season, Hasselbaink&#x27;s 18 goals in 36 appearances made him joint-winner (with Michael Owen and Dwight Yorke) of the Premier League Golden Boot as Leeds finished fourth in the league under the stewardship of new manager David O&#x27;Leary, thus winning the &quot;Whites&quot; a place in the UEFA Cup. However, he and his agent were dissatisfied with the contract offered by the club, and though he still had two years to run on his existing deal he was sold on. O&#x27;Leary claimed: &quot;What he is looking for I don&#x27;t think any club in the country could afford and I don&#x27;t think there is anyone on that kind of money over here [in England]&quot;.

===Atlético Madrid===
Hasselbaink was bought by Spanish club Atlético Madrid for £10 million in the middle of 1999. The &quot;Red-and-Whites&quot; lost the first three La Liga games of the 1999–2000 season, but after Hasselbaink scored his first goal for the club to secure a point at Real Zaragoza he continued to score important goals for the club. On 30 October, he scored twice in the Madrid Derby as Atlético beat Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium for the first time in nine years. He also scored against Barcelona at Camp Nou, in a 2–1 league defeat. Manager Claudio Ranieri aimed to qualify for the Champions League but resigned in February following poor results. Despite this, Hasselbaink shared the league&#x27;s Silver Boot award with Catanha (Málaga CF), scoring only three goals fewer than top-scorer Salva Ballesta (Racing de Santander). Atlético reached the final of the Copa del Rey at the Mestalla Stadium but lost 2–1 to Espanyol; Hasselbaink scored a late consolation goal. The club&#x27;s league form did not improve following Ranieri&#x27;s departure, and his successor Radomir Antić failed to prevent the club from being relegated to the Segunda División. A relegation clause in his four-year contract allowed Hasselbaink to leave the club in the summer.

===Chelsea===
Hasselbaink returned to the Premier League in May 2000, when he was signed by Chelsea for a club record fee of £15 million, which matched the then-transfer record for an English club; he signed a four-year contract. He scored on his &quot;Blues&quot; debut, helping them to win the 2000 FA Charity Shield with a 2–0 win over Manchester United at Wembley Stadium. Manager Gianluca Vialli was dismissed in September, and Hasselbaink&#x27;s former Madrid boss Claudio Ranieri was appointed as his replacement. Hasselbaink later stated he was &quot;dismayed&quot; at Vialli&#x27;s dismissal and that the players hated Ranieri and fitness coach Roberto Sassi&#x27;s running-focused training methods. Despite this, Hasselbaink scored 23 goals in 35 league appearances in the 2000–01 season, including four goals in a 6–1 win against Coventry City on 21 October; he finished the season as the winner of the Premier League Golden Boot.

At the start of the 2001–02 season, Hasselbaink earned the distinction of scoring the first competitive goal at Southampton&#x27;s new St Mary&#x27;s Stadium as Chelsea won 2–0 on 25 August. On 13 March, he scored a hat-trick as Chelsea defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–0. He formed both a good friendship and a productive partnership with Icelandic striker Eiður Guðjohnsen, scoring 29 goals in all competitions whilst Guðjohnsen scored 23 goals in a season which also saw Chelsea reach the FA Cup final after overcoming Norwich City, West Ham United, Preston North End, Tottenham Hotspur, and Fulham. Hasselbaink was a doubt for the final due to a hamstring injury, and was substituted on 68 minutes at the Millennium Stadium as Chelsea lost 2–0 to rivals Arsenal. His total of 23 league goals was one fewer than Golden Boot winner Thierry Henry.

In the summer of 2002, the cause of his hamstring injury was discovered, and he underwent an operation to relieve a blockage in the arteries of his right leg, which had been severely restricting circulation. During his recovery, he appeared as a pundit for ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Ranieri initiated a squad rotation system for the 2002–03 season but focused the team around Gianfranco Zola, which limited Hasselbaink&#x27;s playing time. Barcelona manager Louis van Gaal agreed an £8 million transfer for Hasselbaink in the January transfer window after months of negotiations but was dismissed before the transfer went through and the deal subsequently collapsed. Though the attack was focused on Zola throughout the season, Hasselbaink managed to score 15 goals in 44 games, only one goal fewer than Zola.

In the 2003–04 season, he scored 17 goals in all competitions, which, despite the arrival of new strikers Adrian Mutu and Hernán Crespo, made him top-scorer at the club for the third time in four years. On 27 March, his 32nd birthday, Hasselbaink came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Geremi and scored a hat-trick as Chelsea came from behind to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 5–2 at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea finished the season in second place and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League; Hasselbaink played in both legs of the semi-final defeat to Monaco, as Chelsea lost 5–3 on aggregate.

===Middlesbrough===
In July 2004, Hasselbaink turned down approaches from Fulham, Celtic and Rangers and instead joined Middlesbrough on a two-year contract after a free transfer. Due to several other internationals being signed by the club at the time, he predicted that Middlesbrough could qualify for the Champions League. On 14 August, he scored on his debut for the club in a 2–2 draw with Newcastle United at the Riverside Stadium. In the 2004–05 season he finished as the club&#x27;s top-scorer with 13 goals in 36 Premier League games, including a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 16 October. A seventh-place league finish was enough for the club to qualify for the following year&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

In the 2005–06 season, he scored nine goals in 22 league games and eight in 22 cup appearances. He helped Steve McClaren&#x27;s &quot;Boro&quot; to defeat Xanthi (Greece), Grasshoppers (Switzerland), Dnipro (Ukraine), Litex (Bulgaria), VfB Stuttgart (Germany), Roma (Italy), Basel (Switzerland) and Steaua București (Romania) en route to the UEFA Cup final. In the final, Middlesbrough were beaten 4–0 by Spanish club Sevilla at the Philips Stadion. The cup final proved to be Hasselbaink&#x27;s last appearance for the club, as new manager Gareth Southgate decided to release him in July 2006.

===Charlton Athletic===
After a potential move to Celtic of the Scottish Premier League broke down, Hasselbaink joined his fourth Premier League team, Charlton Athletic, on a free transfer in July 2006. Soon after joining the club, he was charged by the FA with improper conduct and/or bringing the game into disrepute for his claiming Chelsea paid players a bonus after the 2004 Champions League win over Arsenal; a Premier League inquiry into what would have been illegal bonus payments found no evidence to support the claims, which were denied by Chelsea. He scored his first goal for the &quot;Addicks&quot; against his old team Chelsea in a 2–1 defeat at Stamford Bridge on 9 September. After seven games without a goal, Hasselbaink scored against yet another of his former clubs, Middlesbrough, on 13 January, a game which Middlesbrough went on to win 3–1. He was released by Charlton at the end of the 2006–07 season having scored only four goals in 29 games, with half of his goal tally coming against League One side Chesterfield in the League Cup.

===Cardiff City===
Hasselbaink was on the verge of joining Championship side Leicester City in August 2007, but the club later withdrew their offer. Instead Cardiff City chairman Peter Ridsdale, who worked with Hasselbaink at Leeds United, brought him to Cardiff on a one-year deal, putting him in a veteran strike partnership with Robbie Fowler. Manager Dave Jones said that Hasselbaink initially took time to settle and become match fit but despite being a demanding player his professionalism was ultimately a positive influence. On 19 September, Hasselbaink scored his first goal for Cardiff with a 20-yard low drive in the 2–1 league defeat to Watford at Ninian Park. He was nominated for the Player of the Round in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup after scoring an impressive goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He remained as a regular starter for the &quot;Bluebirds&quot; throughout the 2007–08 season, and made appearances in five of the six matches Cardiff played to reach the FA Cup final. In the final Cardiff lost 1–0 to Portsmouth; Hasselbaink played 70 minutes before being substituted for Steve Thompson. As the season finished he entered talks to extend his stay at Cardiff; however, he left the club in July 2008 following a dispute over pay.

==International career==
Hasselbaink came to the attention of Netherlands manager Guus Hiddink whilst playing in England for Leeds United and made his international debut on 27 May 1998 in a 0–0 draw in a friendly with Cameroon at the GelreDome in Arnhem; he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Marc Overmars. On 1 June, he scored his first goal in a 5–1 friendly victory over Paraguay, and a few days later scored his second goal in another 5–1 friendly victory over Nigeria. He was part of the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, as back-up to established international strikers Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp and Pierre van Hooijdonk and wingers Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars. With other strikers not fully fit, Hasselbaink started the opening game against Belgium at the Stade de France, but missed a scoring opportunity in the 0–0 draw and was taken off for Bergkamp after 65 minutes. Kluivert was sent off in the match, but Bergkamp was played as the only striker in the next game against South Korea, and van Hooijdonk was taken off the bench to replace him. In the third group game against Mexico at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard Hasselbaink came on for Bergkamp after 78 minutes, which was to be his last appearance at the tournament as Kluivert returned from suspension to leave Hasselbaink as Hiddink&#x27;s fourth choice forward; Netherlands ended the tournament in fourth place.

Hiddink resigned and was replaced by his assistant Frank Rijkaard, who rarely picked Hasselbaink at international level. Hasselbaink next played on 18 August 1999, alongside Kluivert and Ruud van Nistelrooy in a friendly against Denmark; he was taken off for Clarence Seedorf, and the game ended 0–0. He next appeared six months later, playing ten minutes against Germany and 70 minutes against Scotland, and despite van Nistelrooy being injured Hasselbaink was not selected for UEFA Euro 2000 as the five forwards chosen were Bergkamp, Kluivert, van Hooijdonk, Roy Makaay and Peter van Vossen. He had been part of the 25 man initial squad but, along with André Ooijer and Winston Bogarde, was not chosen for the final 22.

Louis van Gaal rated Hasselbaink more highly than Rijkaard, meaning more chances at international level when van Gaal took over as manager in July 2000. Hasselbaink scored against Spain in a 2–1 win at the Estadio de La Cartuja on 15 November 2000 but both he and Spanish captain Fernando Hierro were sent off for fighting late in the game. On 24 March 2001, he scored in a 5–0 win over Andorra at the Mini Estadi, and four days later converted a penalty in a draw with Portugal at the Estádio das Antas. On 25 April he scored in his third successive World Cup qualifying game, in a 4–0 win over Cyprus at the Philips Stadion. He later played against Estonia (twice), England, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark; he scored a penalty past Denmark in a 1–1 draw at Parken Stadium. Netherlands did not qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup as they finished four points behind Portugal and Ireland.

Dick Advocaat replaced van Gaal as national team manager in January 2002, and Hasselbaink remained in contention. On 21 August, he came on as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Norway at the Ullevaal Stadion, and on 7 September he scored in a 3–0 victory over Belarus, the opening game for Euro 2004 qualifying; this was his last appearance for Netherlands. Hasselbaink did not make the squad for the Euro 2004 finals but was on the stand-by list for the tournament.

==Style of play==
Hasselbaink was a quick sprinter and had a powerful shot. He was able to shoot with his left foot despite being primarily right-footed. Tom Sheen, sports reporter for &quot;The Independent&quot; and a Chelsea supporter, wrote that &quot;[Hasselbaink] possessed one of the best strikes ever seen at Stamford Bridge, was an expert free-kick taker, great with both feet and decent in the air&quot;.

==Coaching career==
In October 2009, Hasselbaink trained with Conference South side Woking to help keep himself fit and do some coaching. He then worked with Chelsea&#x27;s under-16 squad and coached at the Nike Academy while taking his UEFA &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; licences. From July 2011 to January 2013 he was a member of the coaching staff at Nottingham Forest, leaving the club when manager Sean O&#x27;Driscoll was dismissed.

===Royal Antwerp===
In May 2013, Hasselbaink was announced as the new manager of newly relegated Belgian Second Division club Royal Antwerp. He stated that the club was &quot;a two or three year project&quot; and he aimed to win promotion by playing attacking football with younger players on a reduced budget. He made a number of signings for the club, including former England under-19 international John Bostock. He led the club to a seventh-place finish in the 2013–14 season, before turning down a new deal at the club in May 2014.

===Burton Albion===
On 13 November 2014, Hasselbaink was appointed manager at League Two side Burton Albion. He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract, stating that he was attracted to Burton by the club&#x27;s stability. Four days after his appointment he took charge of his first game at Burton, a 3–1 win at Wycombe Wanderers which moved the club into fourth in the table. He was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award in January for going unbeaten in the month and leading the club to victories over promotion rivals Shrewsbury Town and Bury; however Chris Wilder of Northampton Town won the award. On 18 April, Burton won 2–1 away at Morecambe to earn promotion to League One for the first time in their history. Two weeks later, Burton came from 2–1 down, with ten men following the dismissal of goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin, to defeat Cambridge United 3–2 at the Abbey Stadium and win the League Two title. He was named as League One Manager of the Month for September 2015 after overseeing three wins in five games for the division&#x27;s newcomers. At the time of his departure Burton were top of League One.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 4 December 2015, Hasselbaink was appointed as manager of Championship club Queens Park Rangers; he signed on a rolling contract, alongside his assistant David Oldfield. Eight days later, he took charge of them for the first time, in a goalless draw against Burnley at Loftus Road. After the game, he commented that his team were low on confidence, and needed to be given room to express themselves and &quot;play with freedom&quot;. Despite the sale of leading scorer Charlie Austin earlier the same day, Hasselbaink earned his first win in charge of the &quot;Hoops&quot; on 16 January 2016, a 3–0 victory at Rotherham United. He guided them to a 12th-place finish, and spoke of his expectations of a busy summer in the transfer market. He was dismissed on 5 November 2016, with QPR in 17th place.

===Northampton Town===
On 4 September 2017, Hasselbaink was appointed manager of League One club Northampton Town on a three-year deal, replacing Justin Edinburgh who had been sacked after four losses from the start of the season. His first game was against Doncaster Rovers five days later, a home tie which ended in a 1–0 victory for Northampton Town. He was sacked on 2 April 2018 after a loss to Peterborough United made it nine games without a win and had the &quot;Cobblers&quot; in the relegation zone with five games remaining of the 2017–18 season.

===Return to Burton Albion===
On New Year&#x27;s Day 2021, Hasselbaink was appointed manager of Burton Albion for the second time in his career. He made seven permanent and five loan signings, mostly younger players in addition to 33-year old veteran defender Michael Mancienne. Burton finished 16th at the end of the 2021–22 season and he admitted that there was &quot;quite a lot of work to be done&quot; behind the scenes. He held talks with Barnsley in the summer but chose to remain with Burton. He resigned as Burton Albion manager on 5 September 2022 with his team sitting bottom of the table with one point out of seven games, claiming that he had &quot;taken the club as far as I can with the limited resources available&quot;.

===England national team===
In March 2023, Hasselbaink was hired as a coach for the England national team, in a move that reunited him with former Middlesbrough teammate Gareth Southgate. In August 2024, following Southgate&#x27;s departure in the aftermath of England&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2024 final defeat, Hasselbaink also departed his role as assistant head coach.

==Personal life==
Hasselbaink has four daughters. He is the younger brother of Carlos Hasselbaink and uncle of Nigel Hasselbaink, both professional footballers.

==Controversies==
===Race issues in management===
Hasselbaink is one of the few black football managers in England. After being hired by QPR, he was asked by Talksport if he felt that he had added responsibilities as a black manager, to which he answered:

Shortly afterwards, Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite revealed that he had rejected Hasselbaink for the vacant managerial position at his club in 2014, out of fear that racist elements of their support would abuse him.

===2016 corruption allegations===
On 28 September 2016, Hasselbaink was named and shown in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s sting operation involving exposing football management personalities engaging in improper conduct. Hasselbaink negotiated a deal to work with a fictitious Far Eastern firm looking to become involved in the transfer of footballers. Additionally, Hasselbaink, despite the conflict of interest, was open to the idea of signing players represented by the firm. Queens Park Rangers launched an internal investigation and went on to release a statement fully backing Hasselbaink and stated that &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding their sting operation.

<doc id="555690" wikidata="Q634150" url="?curid=555690" title="Charles Lane (actor, born 1905)">
<text>Charles Lane (born Charles Gerstle Levison; January 26, 1905 – July 9, 2007) was an American character actor and centenarian whose career spanned 76 years.

A prolific actor who played hundreds of roles in both film and TV, Lane often played sour, scowling and disagreeable clerks, doctors, judges, and middle-management authority figures. Recalling in 1981 his many roles, he said &quot;They were all good parts, but they were jerks. If you have a type established, though, and you&#x27;re any good, it can mean considerable work for you.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Lane&#x27;s persona was so familiar to the public, &quot;that people would come up to him in the street and greet him, because they thought they knew him from their hometowns.&quot; Lane&#x27;s first film role, of more than 250, was as a hotel clerk in &quot;Smart Money&quot; (1931) starring Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. Lane appeared in many Frank Capra films, including &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936), &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938), &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and &quot;Riding High&quot; (1950).

Lane transitioned smoothly into television, and is probably best remembered to TV viewers for his recurring role as the ever-scheming Homer Bedloe on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. As well, Lucille Ball frequently cast Lane as a no-nonsense authority figure and comedic foe of her scatterbrained TV character on her TV series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Lane gave his last performance at the age of 101 as a narrator in 2006.

==Early life==
Lane was born Charles Gerstle Levison on January 26, 1905, in San Francisco, California, to Jewish parents Alice (née Gerstle) and Jacob B. Levison, an executive at the Fireman&#x27;s Fund Insurance Company who was instrumental in rebuilding the city after the 1906 earthquake.

==Career==
Lane spent a short time as an insurance salesman before taking to the stage at the Pasadena Playhouse. Actor/director Irving Pichel first suggested that Lane go into acting in 1929, and four years later Lane was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. He appeared unbilled but always making his presence known in many famous early-1930s Warner Bros. films, beginning with &quot;Smart Money&quot; then going on to other Pre-Code classics such as &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot;, &quot;Employees&#x27; Entrance&quot;, &quot;Blessed Event&quot;, &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, and &quot;She Had to Say Yes&quot;, finally getting billing when away from Warners&#x27; in &quot;My Woman&quot;, &quot;Looking for Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;. He became a favorite of director Frank Capra; in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, Capra gave Lane a twist on his usual screen persona by casting him as an apparently hard-nosed rent collector who startles his employer, Mr. Potter (played by Lionel Barrymore) by speaking highly of James Stewart&#x27;s character. Lane also appeared in the film &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949) as one of the reporters cajoling Max O&#x27;Hara (Robert Armstrong) for information about the identity of &quot;Mr. Joseph Young&quot;, the persona given featured billing on the front of the building, on opening night.

Among his many roles as a character actor, Lane played Mr. Fosdick in &quot;Dear Phoebe&quot;, which aired on NBC in 1954–1955. He also portrayed mean-spirited railroad executive Homer Bedloe in the situation comedy &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. He guest starred on such series as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;, starring Joanne Dru, and &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot;, as well as the syndicated drama of the American Civil War, &quot;The Gray Ghost&quot;.

He was a good friend of Lucille Ball, and his specialty in playing scowling, short tempered, no-nonsense professionals provided a comic foil for Ball&#x27;s scatterbrained television character. He played several guest roles on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, including an appearance in the episode &quot;Lucy Goes To the Hospital&quot;, where he is seated in the waiting room with Ricky while Lucy gives birth to their son; he later cited this as one of his favorite parts. He also played the title role in the episode &quot;The Business Manager&quot;, the casting director in &quot;Lucy Tells The Truth,&quot; and the passport clerk in &quot;Staten Island Ferry.&quot; Lane appeared twice in &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;. He later had recurring roles as shopkeeper Mr. Finch on &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and during the first season (1962–1963) of Ball&#x27;s &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, playing banker Mr. Barnsdahl. According to &quot;The Lucy Book&quot; by Geoffrey Fidelman, Lane was let go because he had trouble reciting his lines correctly. However, Lane was in reality a placeholder for Ball&#x27;s original choice, Gale Gordon, who joined the program in 1963 as Mr. Mooney after he was free from other contractual obligations.

In 1963, Lane appeared in the classic comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, playing the airport manager. (On the DVD commentary track, historian Michael Schlesinger wryly noted, &quot;You do not have a comedy unless you have Charles Lane in it.&quot;) His final acting role was at the age of 101 in 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;. His last television appearance was at the age of 90, when he appeared in the 1995 Disney TV remake of its 1970 teen comedy &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot;, with Kirk Cameron. In 2005, the TV Land Awards paid tribute to Lane by celebrating his 100th birthday. Seated in a wheelchair in the audience, which had sung &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to him, Lane was presented with his award by Haley Joel Osment and then announced &quot;If you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;m still available [for work]!&quot; The audience gave him a standing ovation.

Lane appeared in more than 250 films and hundreds of television shows and was uncredited in many of them. On his busiest days, Lane said he sometimes played more than one role, getting into costume and filming his two or three lines, then hurrying off to another set or studio for a different costume and a different role. As for being typecast, Lane described it as &quot;... a pain in the ass. You did something that was pretty good, and the picture was pretty good. But that pedigreed you into that type of part, which I thought was stupid and unfair, too. It didn&#x27;t give me a chance, but it made the casting easier for the studio.&quot; Lane is recorded as having appeared in sixty-seven parts in a span of just two years, 1940 to 1942.

==Personal life==

In 1931, Lane married Ruth Covell, and they remained together for 70 years until her death in 2002. They had a son, Charles Jr., and a daughter, Alice.

On January 26, 2007, Lane celebrated his 102nd birthday. He continued to live in the Brentwood home he bought with Ruth (for $46,000 in 1964, equal to $ today) until his death. In the end, his son, Charles Lane Jr., said he was talking with his father at 9 p.m. on the evening of July 9, 2007, &quot;He was lying in bed with his eyes real wide open. Then he closed his eyes and stopped breathing.&quot;

<text>The title of Earl of Aboyne in the Peerage of Scotland is held by the Gordon family, with the heir apparent to the Marquessate of Huntly using it as a courtesy title.

The peerage title of Earl of Aboyne was originally created in September 1660 for Lord Charles Gordon. At the time, he was the fourth son of George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly, and younger brother to James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne. Charles Gordon was also made Lord Gordon of Strathaven and Glenlivet on the same occasion, with both titles being in the Peerage of Scotland.

The title descended from father to son for several generations. Charles Gordon&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the 5th Earl, eventually succeeded to the higher title of Marquess of Huntly in 1836. Since then, the peerage earldom of Aboyne has been a subsidiary title held by the holder of the marquessate.

There is some contemporaneous evidence that suggests the title may have originally been created during the Civil War for Viscount Aboyne. However, this alleged prior creation is not substantiated in the primary sources on British and Scottish peerage.

== Earls of Aboyne (1660) ==
*Charles Gordon, 1st Earl of Aboyne (died 1681)
*Charles Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aboyne (died 1702)
*John Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aboyne (died 1732)
*Charles Gordon, 4th Earl of Aboyne (c. 1726–1794)
*George Gordon, 5th Earl of Aboyne (1761–1853) (succeeded as 9th Marquess of Huntly in 1836)

<text>Wotton-under-Edge is a market town and civil parish in the Stroud district of Gloucestershire, England. Near the southern fringe of the Cotswolds, the Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes through the town.

== History ==

The first record of the town is in an Anglo-Saxon Royal Charter of King Edmund I, who in AD 940 leased four hides of land in &quot;Wudetun&quot; to Eadric. The name &quot;Wudetun&quot; means the enclosure, homestead or village (&quot;tun&quot;) in or near the wood (&quot;wude&quot;). The &quot;Edge&quot; refers to the limestone escarpment of the Cotswold Edge which includes the hills of Wotton Hill and Tor Hill that flank the town. In the 1086 Domesday Book listing, Wotton was in the hundred of Dudstone. Kingswood Abbey was founded in 1139, but all that remains is a 16th-century Cistercian gatehouse. Nearby historical buildings include the Tudor houses of Newark Park and Owlpen Manor, both open to the public at set times. The medieval former public house The Ancient Ram Inn dates back to 1145. The original town was burnt down during the reign of King John (1199–1216); it was rebuilt in 1252 and a charter granted to Johanna de Berkeley authorising her to hold a market and a three-day annual fair on the Feast of the Cross. In 1272 the inhabitants of the borough were authorised to elect one of their members as a Mayor, a practice that continued every year until 1886.

St. Mary the Virgin was consecrated in 1283, and is the oldest and largest church in the town. The Katharine Lady Berkeley&#x27;s Grammar School was established in 1384 and is now a comprehensive named Katharine Lady Berkeley&#x27;s School although the present modern building is a little outside of the town on the way to the village of Kingswood. The British School was established in the village in 1835.

The Battle of Nibley Green occurred near the Ancient Ram Inn in 1470 (or 1469 under the calendar of the time), when the building was owned by Thomas Talbot, 2nd Viscount Lisle. William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley led the forces that beat the Viscount, and after the battle his men sacked the manor. Overlooking the town on the top of Wotton Hill are a collection of trees planted in the 19th century to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo. These are situated on the site that housed one of the early warning beacons used to warn England of the approach of the Spanish Armada in 1588.
 New Mills, founded in 1810, prospered by supplying both sides in the Napoleonic wars but after a century of decline the mill was near to closing in 1981 when it was acquired by Renishaw plc. 

Wotton-under-Edge Town Hall was substantially rebuilt in 1872. The town&#x27;s corporation status was abolished in 1886 following the Municipal Corporations Act of 1883.

== Governance ==
An electoral ward with the same name exists. The ward mainly covers Wotton-under-Edge but also stretches to North Nibley. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,510.

== Facilities ==
The town has several pubs and a hotel, and a range of takeaways and restaurants. It has several active social groups, such as Scouts, a gardening club and the Wotton Lions. In 1958, local people and school students built the town swimming pool, which was completed in 1961. Subsequently the pool has had solar and electric heating installed. In 1999 with the fund raising support of community groups, a retractable enclosure was fitted to prolong the swimming season. In 2015, a skate park was opened. 

In 2002, following the closure of the local cinema, a group of volunteers raised funds for a refurbishment to become one of the first digital cinemas in the UK. It re-opened in 2005 as a 100-seat facility inside an old stable yard, once part of the Crown Inn which closed in 1911. Films were first shown in the old Banqueting Hall of the Inn and moved to the stable yard some years later, due to the popularity of films. The Wotton Electric Picture House (the original name) is now a thriving venue.

On the hills immediately to the east, the Wotton-under-Edge BT Tower formed part of the microwave communication network between Bristol, Corsham and London during the Cold War before decommissioning, and remains a prominent local landmark (albeit without its distinctive horn aerials). Nearby Newark Park is operated by the National Trust as a heritage attraction within walking distance of the town, along with the Neolithic long barrow on a prominent position atop Blackquarries Hill.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Edge Radio, a community based station which started broadcasting during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Gazette Series&quot;. 

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Wotton-under-Edge is on the B4058 road and is from the M5 motorway.

=== Rail ===
Brunel&#x27;s Bristol and Gloucester Railway passes within of Wotton-under-Edge, following a curve to the west to stay on the gentler Vale of Berkeley and avoid Wotton Hill, Nibley Knoll and Stinchcombe Hill as it heads north. It carries a wide mix of local, intercity and freight trains. The nearest railway station on this line is Cam &amp; Dursley, north of the town centre.

Charfield station, to the west, was opened in 1844 and closed in 1965 during the Beeching cuts, leaving Wotton with no rail access. A branch line from Charfield to Wotton was authorised in 1899 under the Light Railways Act, but never constructed.

Following the successful reopening of neighbouring Yate in 1989 and Cam &amp; Dursley in 1994, plans to reopen Charfield station were developed by the West of England Combined Authority in 2021; a planning application was submitted in September 2022, with planning permission granted in March 2023. A &quot;Greenway&quot; is also proposed to allow traffic-free walking and cycling between Wotton, Kingswood and Charfield.

=== Bus ===
Bus services link the town to Charfield, Dursley, Yate, Chipping Sodbury, Nailsworth, Stroud, and Thornbury, but run infrequently. Wotton is not part of WECA, but Katherine Lady Berkeley&#x27;s school is served by the WESTlink on-demand bus, a short walk from the town centre and available to the public Monday-Saturday.

=== Hiking routes ===
*The Cotswold Way follows a route down Wotton Hill and through the centre of the town, making it a popular stopover with hikers.
*The Slow Ways traffic-free accessible walking project connects Wotton to Dursley, Yate, Thornbury, Tetbury and Sherston.
*The Monarch&#x27;s Way passes within of Wotton through nearby Tresham and Hawkesbury Upton.

<text>David Cunningham Garroway (July 13, 1913 – July 21, 1982) was an American television personality. He was the founding host and anchor of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; from 1952 to 1961. His easygoing and relaxing style belied a lifelong battle with depression. Garroway has been honored for his contributions to radio and television with a star for each on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame, the city where he spent part of his teenaged years and early adulthood.

==Early life==
Born in Schenectady, New York, Garroway was of Scottish descent. By the time he was 14, he had moved with his family 13 times, finally settling in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended University City High School and Washington University in St. Louis, from which he earned a degree in abnormal psychology. Before going into broadcasting, Garroway worked as a Harvard University lab assistant, book salesman, and piston ring salesman. After not being able to successfully sell either, Garroway decided to try his hand in radio.

==Career==

===Early years===
Garroway began his broadcasting career at NBC as a page in 1938; he graduated 23rd in a class of 24 from NBC&#x27;s school for announcers. Following graduation, he landed a job at Pittsburgh radio station KDKA in 1939. As a station reporter, he filed reports from a hot-air balloon, a U.S. Navy submarine in the Ohio River, and deep inside a coal mine. His early reporting efforts earned Garroway a reputation for finding a good story, even in unusual places. The &quot;Roving Announcer&quot;, as he was known, worked his way up to become the station&#x27;s special-events director, while still attending to his on-air work. After two years with KDKA, Garroway left for Chicago.

===Radio===

When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Garroway enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving as a line officer. While stationed in Honolulu, he hosted a radio show when he was off duty, playing jazz records and reminiscing about the old days back in Chicago. After the war, Garroway went to work as a disc jockey at WMAQ (AM) in Chicago. Over time, Garroway hosted a series of radio programs, such as &quot;The 11:60 Club&quot;, &quot;The Dave Garroway Show&quot;, and &quot;Reserved for Garroway&quot;. One oddity Garroway introduced on his radio shows was having the studio audience respond to a song number not by applauding, but by snapping their fingers. Garroway also worked to organize jazz concerts, creating a &quot;Jazz Circuit&quot; of local clubs in 1947, bringing back interest in this music genre. His fellow disc jockeys voted him the nation&#x27;s best in the 1948 and 1949 &quot;Billboard&quot; polls. He won the award again in 1951.

Garroway was the first &quot;communicator&quot; on NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; when the program first aired on June 12, 1955. He continued as the Sunday-evening host of the news and music program from 1955 to 1961. Garroway worked on the air at WCBS radio in 1964 and briefly hosted the afternoon rush-hour shift at KFI in Los Angeles in late 1970 and early 1971.
===Television===


Garroway was introduced to the national television audience when he hosted the experimental musical variety show &quot;Garroway at Large&quot;, telecast live from Chicago. It was carried by NBC from June 18, 1949, to June 24, 1951.

Garroway&#x27;s relaxed, informal style when on the air became part of his trademark. In 1960, reviewer Richard F. Shepard of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;He does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking, and not obtrusively convivial&quot;. On television, Garroway was known for his signoff, saying &quot;Peace&quot; with an upraised palm.

Along with Arthur Godfrey, Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, and Jack Paar, Garroway was one of the pioneers of the television talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago. Garroway, Studs Terkel, and Hugh Downs all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative &quot;announcer&#x27;s&quot; intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence. Garroway was one of the broadcasters who introduced conversational style and tone to television, beginning some broadcasts as though the viewer were sitting in the studio with him, as in this November 20, 1957, introduction for the &quot;Today&quot; show: &quot;And how are you about the world today? Let&#x27;s see what kind of shape it&#x27;s in; there is a glimmer of hope&quot;.

Pioneering NBC president Sylvester &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver chose Garroway as the host of his new morning news-and-entertainment experiment, the &quot;Today&quot; show, in 1952. He was joined by news editor Jim Fleming and announcer Jack Lescoulie when the show debuted on Monday, January 14, 1952. Though initially panned by critics, Garroway&#x27;s style attracted a large audience that enjoyed his easygoing presence early in the morning. His familiar &quot;cohost&quot;, a chimpanzee with the puckish name of J. Fred Muggs, did not hurt his genial manner, but his concurrent seriousness in dealing with news stories and ability to clearly explain abstract concepts earned him the nickname &quot;The Communicator&quot; and eventually won praise from critics and viewers alike.

At the same time he did &quot;Today&quot;, Garroway also hosted a Friday-night variety series, &quot;The Dave Garroway Show&quot;, from October 2, 1953, to June 25, 1954. On October 16, 1955, he began hosting NBC&#x27;s live Sunday-afternoon documentary &quot;Wide Wide World&quot;, continuing with that series until June 8, 1958. Another Friday-evening variety show, &quot;Dave&#x27;s Place&quot;, was on the air in 1960. He also hosted a radio show, &quot;Dial Dave Garroway&quot;, that went on the air as soon as &quot;Today&quot; wrapped up each morning. &quot;Dial Dave Garroway&quot; had begun in 1946 when Garroway was still working for WMAQ in Chicago.

Garroway took &quot;Today&quot; to various locations during his tenure - Paris in 1959 and Rome in 1960; car shows and technology expos; plays and movies; and aboard an Air Force B-52 for a practice bombing run. Through television, Garroway gave viewers access to a variety of people that included politicians, writers, artists, scientists, economists, and musicians. In his role as &quot;Today&quot; host, Garroway acted as pitchman for several of the show&#x27;s sponsors. Among them were Admiral television sets, Alcoa, and Sergeant&#x27;s dog food. Most of the appearances were in the form of print ads in newspapers and magazines. By 1960, a board game called &quot;Dave Garroway&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; Game&quot; also was produced.

In 1961, Garroway hosted a special filmed program for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association that traced Billy Graham&#x27;s crusades from 1949 to 1960.

Garroway&#x27;s relaxed demeanor on TV hid his depression. Toward the end of his professional career, he began to have disagreements with staff members; some days, Garroway would disappear in the middle of the &quot;Today&quot; broadcast, leaving colleagues to finish the live program. When Garroway&#x27;s second wife, Pamela, died of a prescription-drug overdose on April 28, 1961, Garroway sank into a deeper emotional malaise. In late May 1961, Garroway resigned, announcing his intention to leave &quot;Today&quot;—either at the end of October when his contract was finished or sooner, if possible — to spend more time with his children. On June 16, 1961, Garroway left the morning show he helped pioneer.

===Later career===
After leaving &quot;Today&quot;, Garroway returned to television on National Educational Television (the forerunner of PBS) with a science series called &quot;Exploring the Universe&quot; in late 1962. Later, he went back to working in radio, doing &quot;split-shift&quot; shows called &quot;Garroway AM&quot; (midmornings) and &quot;Garroway PM&quot; (midafternoons) for WCBS (AM), New York. Garroway also started a magazine, &quot;National FM-Radio&quot;; the venture was a costly failure, with Garroway realizing he was not cut out to be a businessman. While he was in the publishing business, Garroway began reading various law books to try to understand what his lawyer was saying. His attorney told him that he had done enough legal reading to pass the New York State bar exam. On a bet, Garroway sat for and passed the written exam.

In April 1969, Garroway launched a daytime talk show on WNAC-TV, &quot;Tempo Boston,&quot; which he hoped would be picked up for national syndication. Stations in New York and Philadelphia agreed to pick up the show, but by early 1970, the small-scale syndication ended and &quot;Tempo&quot; was cancelled. The show had promise, but management instead decided to fill its time slot with old movies instead of more expensive local programming. After leaving the Boston airwaves, Garroway traveled to Southern California, hosting a music-and-talk show on KFI radio in Los Angeles. He planned to re-enter the television world with a CBS summer replacement show, &quot;Newcomers&quot;, but the show never made it past the summer of 1971. While in Los Angeles, Garroway began to take acting workshops; he had a role in an episode of the Western series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; as a judge in 1972.

Garroway appeared sporadically on other television programs without achieving the success and recognition levels he enjoyed on &quot;Today&quot;. He largely remained out of the public eye for the rest of the 1960s and 1970s, although he did re-emerge for &quot;Today&quot; anniversaries. His final such appearance was on the 30th-anniversary show, on January 14, 1982.

===Other media===
Garroway narrated a compilation of romantic songs performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra, &quot;Getting Friendly with Music,&quot; in 1956. He also served as narrator for special albums, including 1964&#x27;s &quot;The Great Campaigners, 1928–1960&quot; and 1960&#x27;s &quot;Names From the Wars.&quot;

In 1960, Garroway wrote &quot;Fun on Wheels,&quot; an activity book for children on road trips. The book was revised and reissued in 1962 and 1964.

Toward the end of his life, Garroway planned to write an autobiography. The book never made it past the research stage; the surviving notes, manuscripts, audio tapes, and news clippings were sent to former &quot;Today&quot; researcher Lee Lawrence. Upon Lawrence&#x27;s death in 2003, the boxes were turned over to the Library of American Broadcasting, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries, where they remained as of 2009.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

Garroway was married three times and had three children. His first marriage was to Adele Dwyer, whom he married in 1945. The couple had a daughter, Paris, before divorcing the following year. He married former actress and ballerina Pamela Wilde in 1956. They had a son, David Cunningham Garroway Jr., in 1958. Garroway later adopted Wilde&#x27;s son Michael from her first marriage. Wilde died of a prescription-drug overdose on April 28, 1961. Garroway married astronomer Sarah Lee Lippincott in February 1980. They remained married until Garroway&#x27;s death in 1982.

===Interests===

Garroway was very interested in astronomy, and during a tour of Russian telescopes, he met his third wife, astronomer Sarah Lee Lippincott. In his final years, he attended astronomy symposia at Swarthmore College and spent time at Sproul Observatory.

Garroway was also an automobile enthusiast, and one of his hobbies was collecting and restoring vintage luxury and sports cars. He was especially fond of his 1938 SS Jaguar 100, which he also raced in his spare time. Garroway was featured in several automobile commercials, including the first Chevrolet Corvette in 1953, and the Ford Falcon in 1964.

Garroway, a music lover and amateur drummer, lent his name to a series of recordings of jazz, classical, and pop music released in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Among them were &quot;Wide, Wide World of Jazz&quot;, 1957&#x27;s &quot;Some of My Favorites&quot;, and 1958&#x27;s &quot;Dave Garroway&#x27;s Orchestra: An Adventure in Hi-Fi Music&quot;.

==Death==
In 1981, Garroway underwent open-heart surgery, as a result of which he contracted a staph infection. On January 14, 1982, &quot;Today&quot; broadcast its 30th-anniversary special, which featured all of the important living, former, and current staff members. Garroway, who had recently undergone drug rehabilitation for an amphetamine addiction, appeared to be cheerful and in good spirits during the show. He also indicated that he would be present for the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary in 1987.

A few months later, however, Garroway began suffering complications from the infection he had contracted during surgery. He spent some weeks in and out of hospitals and had an in-home nurse tending to him. On July 21, he was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound at his Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, home. No suicide note was found and Garroway&#x27;s nurse did not recall him being unusually depressed in the final day of his life. Garroway&#x27;s son Michael said that his father had been experiencing complications from his heart operation and he had &quot;unfortunately succumbed to the traumatic effects of his illness&quot;. In addition, he was extremely depressed at his inability to resurrect a TV career, saying to friends and family &quot;I&#x27;m old hat, old news. Nobody wants old Dave anymore&quot;. His family held a private graveside service for him in Philadelphia on July 28.

The July 22 edition of &quot;Today&quot; was mainly a remembrance of Garroway. His colleague Jack Lescoulie, news editor Frank Blair, and former consumer reporter Betty Furness offered tributes on the show. Garroway&#x27;s death was noted on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Tom Brokaw and Roger Mudd. Commentator John Chancellor was the man who had replaced Garroway on &quot;Today&quot; 21 years earlier. On &quot;NBC News Overnight,&quot; host Linda Ellerbee closed the program with &quot;Peace&quot; instead of her usual &quot;And so it goes&quot;.

Because of Garroway&#x27;s dedication to the cause of mental health, his third wife, Sarah, helped establish the Dave Garroway Laboratory for the Study of Depression at the University of Pennsylvania.

==Parodies and fictional representations==
Robert McKimson&#x27;s 1960 cartoon &quot;Wild Wild World&quot; depicts &quot;Cave Darroway&quot; presenting footage from the Stone Age.

&quot;Mad&quot; spoofed him in one issue (issue #26, from November, 1955) as &quot;The Dave Garrowunway Show&quot;.

In Robert Redford&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, Garroway was portrayed by Barry Levinson.

<text>Baron of Aghrim was a title created twice in the Peerage of Ireland, both times as a subsidiary title. The first creation was on 13 April 1676 for Lord John Butler, who was created Earl of Gowran at the same time. Both titles became extinct a year later. The second creation was on 4 March 1692 for Godert de Ginkell, who was also created Earl of Athlone. This creation of the title (along with the Earldom of Athlone), became extinct in 1844.

<text>Duke of Cleveland was a title that was created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The dukedoms were named after Cleveland in northern England.

The first creation in 1670 (along with the barony of Nonsuch and the earldom of Southampton) was for [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Castlemaine]], a mistress of King Charles II. The dukedom was created with a special remainder allowing it to be inherited by her first son, Charles FitzRoy, and his heirs male, then by her third son, George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, both being her illegitimate sons by Charles II. Charles FitzRoy was created Duke of Southampton in 1675 and inherited the dukedom of Cleveland in 1709.

His son William inherited both dukedoms in 1730. He died without heirs male in 1774. As there were no heirs male descended from George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland and the 1st Duchess of Cleveland&#x27;s 2nd son (Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton) and his heirs male had not been made eligible to inherit the dukedom of Cleveland, the title became extinct.

The dukedom of Cleveland was created again on 29 January 1833 for William Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington, along with the title &quot;Baron Raby&quot;. He was a great-grandson of Charles FitzRoy, the second Duke of the first creation, and had already been created Marquess of Cleveland on 5 October 1827. For more information on this creation, which became extinct in 1891, and the Vane family, see the Baron Barnard.

==Dukes of Cleveland, first creation (1670)==
The Dukes also held the titles of Countess of Southampton and Baroness Nonsuch, in the County of Surrey, created at the same time. The second and third Dukes also held the titles of Duke of Southampton, Earl of Chichester and Baron of Newbury, in the County of Berkshire (created 1675).
*Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland (1641–1709), a mistress of Charles II
*Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland, 1st Duke of Southampton (1662–1730), eldest (illegitimate) son of the 1st Duchess of Cleveland and Charles II
*William FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Cleveland, 2nd Duke of Southampton (1698–1774), eldest son of the 2nd Duke of Cleveland. He died without issue, and his titles were extinct.

==Dukes of Cleveland, second creation (1833)==

Other titles held by these Dukes include Marquess of Cleveland (1827), Earl of Darlington, in the County of Durham and Viscount Barnard, of Barnard&#x27;s Castle in the county of Durham (1754), Baron Barnard, of Barnard&#x27;s Castle in the Bishopric of Durham (1698), and Baron Raby, of Raby Castle in the County Durham (1833).
*William Harry Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland (1766–1842), great-grandson of the above 2nd Duke
*Henry Vane, 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1788–1864), eldest son of the 1st Duke
*William John Frederick Vane, 3rd Duke of Cleveland (1792–1864), second son of the 1st Duke
*Harry George Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland (1803–1891), youngest son of the 1st Duke. All of his titles except for Baron Barnard became extinct upon his death without issue.

<text>Halmahera, formerly known as Jilolo, Gilolo, or Jailolo, is the largest island in the Maluku Islands. It is part of the North Maluku province of Indonesia, and Sofifi, the capital of the province, is located on the west coast of the island.

Halmahera has a land area of . It is the largest island of Indonesia outside the five main islands. It had a population of 162,728 in 1995; by 2010, it had increased to 449,938 for the island itself (excluding the tip which is considered part of the Joronga Islands, but including Gebe and Ju islands) and 667,161 for the island group (including all of South Halmahera and Tidore, but not Ternate). Approximately half of the island&#x27;s inhabitants are Muslim and half are Christian.

==History==
Sparsely-populated Halmahera&#x27;s fortunes have long been closely tied to those of the smaller islands of Ternate and Tidore, both off its west coast. This island was the site of Sultanate of Jailolo, one of the four kingdoms of Maluku (&quot;Maloko Kië Raha&quot;, of Ternate, Tidore, Bacan, and Jailolo) in the era before Dutch East India Company colonized the entire archipelago. The north of the island is also the base of , one of the earlier 13th century Moluccan kingdom, but not recognized as one of the prominent four.

During World War II, Halmahera was the site of a Japanese naval base at Kao Bay.

In 1999 and 2000, Halmahera was the site of violence that began as a purely ethnic dispute between residents of (mainly Christian) Kao and (entirely Muslim) Malifut sub-districts and then took on a religious nature as it spread through much of the North Moluccas, called the Maluku sectarian conflict. Thousands of people on Halmahera were killed in the fighting between religious militias. In June 2000, about five hundred people were killed when a ferry carrying refugees from the fighting on Halmahera sank off the northeast tip of Sulawesi island. Conspiracy theories about this event abound. A memorial to this tragedy can be found in Duma village in North Halmahera district.

Today, much transportation to the rest of Indonesia is through connections on the provincial capital, Ternate island although Tobelo, the largest town on Halmahera, also has direct ferry and cargo sea links to Surabaya and Manado.

Particularly, since the inauguration of the first ever directly elected Bupati (Regent or District Head), Tobelo is undergoing rapid development and is aiming at rivaling Ternate&#x27;s historical dominance. As it is surrounded by flat land, Tobelo has the potential for expansion. Ternate is limited by its size, being a small island which can be driven around in forty-five minutes. Also, in 2010, the provincial government has moved the provincial capital from Ternate City to Sofifi, a small village on the Halmahera coast opposite Tidore island.

North Maluku Province consists of eight regencies and two municipalities (cities); five of the regencies and one municipality include a part of Halmahera island. The regencies are North Halmahera, West Halmahera, East Halmahera, Central Halmahera, South Halmahera, Morotai, Sula Islands and Taliabu, while the municipalities are Ternate and Tidore Islands. Only Ternate Municipality, and Morotai, the Sula Islands and Taliabu regencies do not include any part of Halmahera.

The coastal area of Halmahera inhabited by the Tobelo people (or the &quot;O’Hoberera Manyawa&quot; (literally &quot;people that live outside of the forest&quot;)), while a small semi-nomadic related population living on the inner parts of Halmahera, the number of Togutil people (or the &quot;O&#x27;Hongana Manyawa&quot; (literally &quot;people that live inside of the forest&quot;)) is estimated between 1500 and 3000 people (according to studies of ethnologists since 2001).″ From 300 to 500, (also an estimatation), live in isolation in the forest in the Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park where they obtain their means of subsistence. Uncontacted members are being threatened by a massive Indonesian mining project to produce nickel for electric car batteries.

==Geology==
The volcanic island lies on an island arc that includes the Raja Ampat Islands, all uplifted by the northward migration of the continent of Australia and subduction of the Pacific Plate. Dukono is an active volcano at the north end of the island. Mount Ibu is an active volcano on the island&#x27;s northwest coast.

==Ecology==

The flightless invisible rail is endemic to the island. The recently discovered palm tree &quot;Jailoloa halmaherensis&quot; is also endemic to Halmahera.

The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace visited Halmahera, as described in his 1869 book &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot;. He considered the standardwing bird of paradise, &quot;Semioptera wallacii&quot;, to be his greatest prize. It was in February 1858, on the island of Ternate (or perhaps while on Halmahera itself), between bouts of fever, that Wallace came to the idea of natural selection via the survival of the fittest. Wallace wrote his ideas during the next couple of days, and sent the historical letter to Darwin.

==Mining==

Halmahera is the site of several mining projects.

PT Weda Bay Nickel operates a nickel and cobalt mining project in North and Central Halmahera Regencies, the Weda Bay Industrial Park. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest nickel mining operations. The Indonesian government has prohibited the export of unprocessed nickel ore since 2022. As a result, the ore must first be processed on the island before being exported. A total of 11 (with three more in construction) power plants have already been built for this process. The park is likely to get even bigger. Several investors have already been found willing to invest. The increased demand for nickel for batteries is one of the reasons for the growth.

<text>Baron Airedale, of Gledhow in the West Riding of the County of York, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 17 July 1907 for the Liberal politician Sir James Kitson, 1st Baronet, who had previously represented Colne Valley in the House of Commons and served as Lord Mayor of Leeds. Kitson had already been created a Baronet, of Gledhow in the West Riding of the County of York, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom 1886. Variations of the name Kitson included Kittson whose family crest incorporated a demi-unicorn. This unicorn is evident in the Airedale crest atop the arms granted to James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale in 1907. Both the title (Barony) and Baronetcy became extinct on the death of his grandson, the fourth Baron, in 1996.

<doc id="555720" wikidata="Q1248625" url="?curid=555720" title="The Mod Squad">
<text>The Mod Squad is an American crime drama series, originally broadcast for five seasons on ABC from September 24, 1968, to March 1, 1973. It starred Michael Cole as Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Cochran, Clarence Williams III as Lincoln &quot;Linc&quot; Hayes, Peggy Lipton as Julie Barnes, and Tige Andrews as Captain Adam Greer. The executive producers of the series were Aaron Spelling and Danny Thomas.

The counterculture police series earned six Emmy Award nominations, four Golden Globe nominations plus one win for Peggy Lipton, one Directors Guild of America Award, and four Logies. In 1970, the second-season episode, &quot;In This Corner . . . Sol Alpert,&quot; script by Rita Lakin and Harve Bennett, was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for an Edgar Award in the category of Best Mystery Teleplay, losing to the TV-Movie &quot;Daughter of the Mind&quot;. In 1997, a 1970 episode &quot;Mother of Sorrow&quot; was ranked #95 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.

==Plot==
They were The Mod Squad (&quot;One black, one white, one blonde&quot;), described by one critic as &quot;the hippest and first young undercover cops on TV&quot;. Each of these characters represented mainstream culture&#x27;s principal fears regarding youth in the era: long-haired rebel Pete Cochran (Michael Cole) was evicted from his wealthy parents&#x27; Beverly Hills home, then arrested and put on probation after he stole a car; Lincoln Hayes (Clarence Williams III), who came from a family of 13 children, was arrested in the Watts riots, one of the longest and most violent riots in Los Angeles history; flower child Julie Barnes (Peggy Lipton), the &quot;canary with a broken wing,&quot; was arrested for vagrancy after running away from her prostitute mother&#x27;s San Francisco home; and Captain Adam Greer (Tige Andrews) was a tough but sympathetic mentor and father figure who convinced them to form the squad.

The concept was to take three rebellious, disaffected young social outcasts and convince them to work as unarmed undercover detectives as an alternative to being incarcerated. Their youthful, hippie personas would enable them to get close to the criminals they would investigate. &quot;The times are changing,&quot; Captain Greer explained. &quot;They can get into places we (the regular police) can&#x27;t.&quot; Examples included their infiltrations of a high school to solve a teacher&#x27;s murder, of an underground newspaper to find a bomber, and of an acting class to look for a strangler who was preying on blonde actresses.

More than a year before the release of the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; was one of the earliest attempts to deal with the counterculture. Groundbreaking in the realm of socially relevant drama, it dealt with issues such as abortion, domestic violence, child abuse, illiteracy, slumlords, the anti-war movement, illegal immigration, police brutality, student protest, sex education, soldiers returning from Vietnam and PTSD, racism, euthanasia, and the illegal drug trade. Spelling intended the show to be about the characters&#x27;s relationships, and he promised that the Squad &quot;would never arrest kids... or carry a gun or use one.&quot;

The show was loosely based on creator Bud &quot;Buddy&quot; Ruskin&#x27;s experiences in the late 1950s as a squad leader for young undercover narcotics cops, though it took almost 10 years after he wrote a script for the idea to be green-lighted by ABC Television Studios.

==Impact==
The shows &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966–69), &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965–68), &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot; (1969–71), &quot;Room 222&quot; (1969–74), &quot;Mannix&quot; (1967–75), &quot;&quot; (1966–73), &quot;Julia&quot; (1968–71), &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; (1970–74), and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (1968–73) were among the first programs to feature African-Americans as stars since the stereotyped roles of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; and &quot;Beulah&quot; (ABC, 1950–53). Significantly, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; presented an African-American character (Linc) as being on an equal footing, as roles went, to the Caucasian characters (Barnes and Cochran). In one &quot;Mod Squad&quot; episode, the script called for Linc to give Barnes a &quot;friendly kiss&quot;. Since the first interracial kiss on an American television show was in 1968, this was still fairly new territory in popular culture. The studio was frightened of a negative public reaction, so they asked Spelling to cut it:

&quot;You can&#x27;t do that,&quot; I was told. &quot;You can&#x27;t have a black man kissing a white girl.&quot; I won and ABC agreed to let it in, but they warned me I&#x27;d receive thousands of complaint letters. I didn&#x27;t get one.

Linc&#x27;s famous &quot;solid&quot; and &quot;keep the faith&quot; were among the current-day slang used on the show, which included &quot;pad&quot;, &quot;dig it&quot;, and &quot;groovy.&quot;

The &quot;kids&quot; traveled in Pete&#x27;s old station wagon, &quot;Woody&quot;: a green woodie-style 1950 Mercury which became famous until it burned up in a fire after going over a cliff during a chase at the end of the second-season episode &quot;The Death of Wild Bill Hannachek&quot;.

Among the series guest stars were Spelling&#x27;s ex-wife Carolyn Jones, Leslie Nielsen, William Windom, Ed Asner (three episodes in three different roles), Vincent Price, Sammy Davis Jr. (three episodes in three different roles), Andy Griffith, Joe Don Baker, David Cassidy, Richard Pryor, Lee Grant, Richard Dreyfuss (two episodes in two different roles), Jo Van Fleet, Tom Bosley, Marion Ross, Danny Thomas (as well as being co-executive producer of the show), Tyne Daly (two episodes in two different roles), Anthony Geary, Sam Elliott, Martin Sheen, Desi Arnaz Jr., René Auberjonois, Stefanie Powers, Robert Reed, Cesar Romero, Meg Foster (two episodes in two different roles), Jack Cassidy, Tony Dow, Vic Tayback, Fritz Weaver, Harrison Ford (uncredited role), Clint Howard, Louis Gossett Jr., Sugar Ray Robinson, Bobby Sherman (two episodes in two different roles), Billy Dee Williams, Victor Buono, Jim Backus, Fernando Lamas, Cleavon Little, Daniel J. Travanti (three episodes in three different roles), Barbara McNair and Rodolfo Hoyos Jr. (three episodes in three different roles).

==Syndication==
In the U.S., MeTV reran the series from May 26 to August 29, 2014, and again on Sunday afternoons from January 4 to August 30, 2015.
Decades re-ran part of the series on February 24–25, 2018, and again on January 30–31, 2021, for their binge weekend programming block; they presented one final Weekend Binge of it on March 25–26, 2023 before the network changed into Catchy Comedy. &quot;Mod Squad&quot; was being shown on MeTv+ late in 2021.

==Related productions==
A television pilot was shot in 1968, with a running time of 74 minutes, but it was never aired in its entirety. The film was edited to 50 minutes and aired as the show&#x27;s first episode. The uncut 74-minute version appears on the DVD set as the opening episode, with the title &quot;The Teeth of the Barracuda.&quot;

A TV reunion movie, &quot;The Return of the Mod Squad,&quot; was transmitted on ABC on May 18, 1979, featuring the entire original cast. Tom Bosley, a guest star during the original run, also participated as an antagonist targeting Julie Barnes herself. Peggy Lipton said she participated in it as a favor to Aaron Spelling.

In 1999, the series was adapted into a feature film with the same title by MGM; however, this film, which starred Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps, Claire Danes, and Dennis Farina in Cole&#x27;s, Williams III&#x27;s, Lipton&#x27;s, and Andrews&#x27;s roles respectively, was not a box-office success.

==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released the first two seasons of &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

On August 20, 2013, it was announced that Visual Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series (under license from Paramount) and would release season 3 on DVD on September 24, 2013. Season 4 would be released on October 1, 2013. In Canada, Season 3 was released on DVD a week earlier, on September 17, 2013, and Season 4 was released on October 8, 2013. Season 5 was released in Canada on November 19, 2013 and in the US on December 17, 2013. A complete series set was released in Canada and the US on November 12, 2013.

==References elsewhere in popular culture==

The term &quot;Mod Squad&quot; had been introduced the previous year in &quot;Dragnet 1967&#x27;s&quot; sixteenth installment, &quot;The Big Kids,&quot; where it described a club of high schoolers who had to shoplift at least $20 to become members.

In 1990 on the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; in which Lipton was a regular, Williams appeared in two episodes. The pair shared a brief scene that appears to have been an intentional reunion.

<doc id="555724" wikidata="Q5326189" url="?curid=555724" title="Earl of Airth">
<text>Earl of [[Airth]] was a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created on 21 January 1633 by Charles I, for William Graham, 7th Earl of Menteith. It became extinct on the death of his grandson in 1694.

Owing to the uncanonicity of the marriage of Robert II to Elizabeth Mure, and the 1373 Act which only sidestepped this question for heirs male of Robert II&#x27;s sons, William Graham&#x27;s ancestors potentially had a better claim to the Scottish throne than Mary, Queen of Scots. Graham thus had a potentially better claim to the throne than Mary&#x27;s descendant, Charles I, as Graham&#x27;s claim descends from Robert II&#x27;s second - undoubted - marriage. Graham had successfully petitioned for the return of the title of Earl of Strathearn which the first Graham Earl of Mentieth had held. Before he was invested, however, Graham boasted that his blood was &quot;bluer than the King&#x27;s&quot;. He was dismissed from his positions and instead of receiving the Earldom of Strathearn, he was given the insultingly minor title of Earl of Airth.

==Earls of Airth (1633)==
*William Graham, 1st Earl of Airth (c. 1591 – 1661)
*William Graham, 2nd Earl of Airth (c. 1634 – 1694)

==19th century claimant==
On the death of the 2nd Earl of Airth the earldom became dormant. In 1834 Capt Robert Barclay Allardice of Ury and Allardice petitioned the King to be recognised as Earl of Airth as a descendant of William Graham, 1st Earl of Airth, his great-great-great-grandfather, basing his claim on the fact that the Letters Patent of 1633 specified descent to &#x27;heirs general&#x27;, rather than limiting it to &#x27;heirs male&#x27;. The petition was referred to the House of Lords. No decision was forthcoming and in 1840 Capt Barclay Allardice petitioned Queen Victoria for him to be recognised as Earl of Strathearn, Menteith and Airth. Capt Barclay Allardice died in 1854 and his elder daughter, Mary Barclay Allardice, renewed the claim in 1870. The Committee for Privileges heard evidence in support of the opposing claims in 1870 and 1871, but came to no decision, and the three Earldoms remained dormant. On 29 April 2011, Queen Elizabeth II conferred the title of Earl of Strathearn on Prince William of Wales. As a result, on marriage his wife Catherine became Countess of Strathearn. He generally uses this title in Scotland.

<doc id="555726" wikidata="Q2297720" url="?curid=555726" title="The Greatest American Hero">
<text>The Greatest American Hero is an American comedy-drama superhero television series that aired on ABC. Created by producer Stephen J. Cannell, it premiered as a two-hour pilot movie on March 18, 1981, and ran until February 2, 1983. The series features William Katt as teacher Ralph Hinkley, Robert Culp as FBI agent Bill Maxwell, and Connie Sellecca as lawyer Pam Davidson. The lead character&#x27;s surname was temporarily changed to &quot;Hanley&quot; for a few months immediately after President Ronald Reagan and three others were shot and wounded by John Hinckley Jr. on March 30, 1981.

The series chronicles Ralph&#x27;s adventures after a group of aliens gives him a red and black suit that grants him superhuman abilities. Unfortunately for Ralph, he must learn how to use the suit&#x27;s powers by trial and error, often with comical results.

The theme song, sung by Joey Scarbury, was a hit when released as a single.

==Premise==
Ralph Hinkley (Katt) is a Los Angeles teacher of remedial education high school students. During a school field trip, Ralph encounters extraterrestrials who give him a suit which endows him with superhuman abilities. During the encounter, he is also instructed by the aliens to thereafter collaborate with FBI Special Agent Bill Maxwell (Culp). Their instructions are to use the suit as a means to fight crime and injustice in the world.

Subsequently, attorney Pam Davidson (Sellecca), who handled Ralph&#x27;s divorce, also encounters the aliens. Through some coercion, she eventually agrees, on occasion, to join Ralph and Bill during missions.

Also seen regularly were Rhonda Blake (Faye Grant), Tony Villicana (Michael Paré), and Cyler Johnson (Jesse D. Goins), three of Ralph&#x27;s students; and Bill&#x27;s FBI supervisor Les Carlisle (William Bogert).

===Suit and hero persona===

Ralph&#x27;s uniform grants him the powers of flight, super strength, invulnerability, invisibility, precognition, telekinesis, X-ray vision, super speed, pyrokinesis, shrinking, psychometry (&quot;holographic vision&quot;), and even the ability to detect the supernatural. As Ralph lost the suit&#x27;s instruction manual, his discovery of these different powers often come as a surprise even to himself. Notably, while the suit enables Ralph to fly, it does not endow him with any particular skill at landing, so he frequently crashes in an undignified (though uninjured) heap. In the episode &quot;Fire Man&quot; he displays resistance to fire/heat and uses &quot;super exhalation&quot; (the ability to blow out a flamethrower, or any other large source of fire); he also uses this ability in the episode &quot;There&#x27;s Just No Accounting ...&quot;, to extinguish a Molotov cocktail. Ralph also shows signs of being able to control minds after he is exposed to high doses of plutonium radiation. In the season two final episode, &quot;Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell&quot;, Ralph is shown to control a dog via a hologram. This may have been an improvisational power of the suit, but is not tried again in later episodes. In &quot;The Shock Will Kill You&quot;, he (or the suit) becomes strongly magnetized.

In the season two episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot;, Ralph and Maxwell learn they are not the first duo who received such a uniform. Jim &quot;J.J.&quot; Beck had received the suit, and Marshall Dunn was his partner, much like Ralph and Maxwell operated. But Jim was overwhelmed with the power of the suit, and he used it selfishly and for ill-gotten gains, until the aliens discovered this and took the suit away. It is unknown whether or not there were others before Jim who were visited by the aliens. In &quot;Divorce Venusian Style&quot;, the pair meet one of the aliens, whose world was apparently destroyed (which hints as to why the aliens want to protect humanity) and calls Earth one of the few remaining &quot;garden planets&quot;. Ralph is given another instruction book during this encounter—supposedly the aliens&#x27; last copy, but he loses it as well. When he shrinks to a fraction of normal size, he places it on a large boulder which is actually a grain of sand given his reduced size, and forgets to pick it back up before returning to normal size.

In the episode &quot;Vanity, Says the Preacher&quot;, it is also revealed there are several humans in seeming &quot;suspended animation&quot; aboard the aliens&#x27; ship (Bill speculates that they are possible replacements for them).

Hinkley&#x27;s hero persona never receives an actual &quot;superhero name&quot; either, although Joey Scarbury sings the Elton John song &quot;Rocket Man&quot; in the pilot. In the pilot episode, Ralph sarcastically refers to himself as &quot;Captain Crash&quot; in reference to his terrible flying ability; and later &quot;Captain Gonzo&quot; in the episode &quot;The Shock Could Kill You&quot;.

Like his character, William Katt found the suit very uncomfortable and hated wearing it. Producers made various modifications to the suit to help him, and accommodated him by scheduling filming so he would not have to wear it all day during a shoot.

===Symbol===
On the Season 1 DVD, Stephen J. Cannell notes that the symbol design on the front of the suit is actually based on a pair of scissors that he had on his desk during the design of the uniform. He said that the costume designer asked him what he wanted the suit&#x27;s chest emblem to look like. He said he had not really thought about it. The designer then picked the scissors up off the desk, held them upside down, and said &quot;That&#x27;s your emblem&quot;. Cannell was fine with that decision.
The symbol on Ralph&#x27;s uniform resembles the Chinese character for &quot;center&quot; . As the symbol is red in color with white background, Hong Kong television station TVB titled the Cantonese-dubbed version of the show &quot;Fēi Tīn Hùhng Jūng Hahp&quot; (), meaning &quot;Flying Red Center Hero&quot;, in reference to the red center mahjong tile. An alternate translation of &quot;jūng&quot; in Cantonese is &quot;justice&quot;, which gave the other meaning for the title of the show &quot;Flying Red Justice Hero&quot;. This alternate translation of the show title alludes to the mandate by the alien grantor to use the suit as a means to fight crime and injustice in the world.

The symbol&#x27;s bilateral symmetry seemingly avoided the &quot;backward S&quot; problem encountered on the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. For the low-budget 1950s series, editors would on occasion &quot;flop&quot; stock footage of George Reeves in flight, causing the &quot;S&quot; shield to appear reversed. However, in many &quot;Greatest American Hero&quot; composite flying sequences, Ralph wore a watch and the timepiece alternates from one wrist to the other, especially during extended flying sequences.

==Cast and characters==
* William Katt as Ralph Hinkley/Ralph Hanley
* Robert Culp as Bill Maxwell
* Connie Sellecca as Pam Davidson
* Faye Grant as Rhonda Blake
* Michael Paré as Tony Villicana
* Jesse D. Goins as Cyler Johnson
* Don Cervantes as Paco Rodriguez
* William Bogert as Les Carlisle

===Ralph&#x27;s surname===
The main character&#x27;s name was originally Ralph Hinkley, but after the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley, Jr., on March 30, 1981, the character&#x27;s last name was hurriedly changed to &quot;Hanley&quot; in two episodes. In &quot;Here&#x27;s Looking at You, Kid&quot;, aired within days of the incident, this was accomplished by overdubbing a student&#x27;s use of &quot;Mister Hinkley&quot; to &quot;Mister H,&quot; and later by dropping out the audio and dubbing jet engine roars over June Lockhart&#x27;s two mentions of Ralph&#x27;s surname in an airport scene. Two weeks later in &quot;Reseda Rose,&quot; the name &quot;Hinkley&quot; was overdubbed &quot;Hanley&quot; whenever the character&#x27;s last name was spoken aloud, which happened frequently in the episode. This was the only episode in which the name &quot;Hanley&quot; was spoken aloud; for the rest of the abbreviated first season (which only lasted 9 episodes), the character was generally referred to as either &quot;Ralph&quot; or &quot;Mister H&quot;. The only other instance of the use of the name Hanley was in episode 9, &quot;The Best Desk Scenario,&quot; in which Ralph is given a promotion and his own office space, and we see the name &quot;Ralph Hanley&quot; on the door plaque. By the season 2 premiere &quot;The Two-Hundred-Mile-an-Hour Fast Ball&quot; (the very next episode in viewing order), the show&#x27;s producers returned the character&#x27;s surname to the original Hinkley.

==Episodes==

==Production==
On the series&#x27; season 1 DVD set Stephen J. Cannell explained that he had planned &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; as a series emphasizing real-life problems, whereas when a change of management occurred in ABC, they requested more heroic, save-the-day-type episodes. As agreed originally between Cannell and then ABC executives Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, the powers would be in the suit, not the man (though the suit would only work for him) and Ralph would try to solve ordinary-type problems, such as trying to stop corruption in Major League Baseball (&quot;The Two Hundred Miles-Per-Hour Fastball&quot;) or an assassination attempt (&quot;The Best Desk Scenario&quot;). The series initially emphasized what Cannell referred to as &quot;character comedy&quot; based on human flaws such as envy (in the aforementioned &quot;The Best Desk Scenario&quot;) or hypochondria (&quot;Plague&quot;). The series differed from previous superhero shows because of the emphasis on (especially Ralph) &quot;rising above&quot; superhero antics and instead exploring what it was like to live in that environment.

Cannell was trying to avoid save-the-day-type episodes, as per the original &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; television series, but according to Cannell on the DVD set, when Carsey and Werner left ABC (soon after the show was purchased by the network) the new network executives wanted the show to be more like a children&#x27;s show than an adults&#x27; show. So they pushed for the types of shows that Cannell did not want, shows that involved Ralph trying to stop some sort of calamity from happening, including nuclear war (&quot;Operation Spoilsport&quot;) and even a Loch Ness Monster-type of creature (&quot;The Devil in the Deep Blue Sea&quot;). For the season two finale, a serious and appropriate for the time (considering the Cold War) episode was produced; &quot;Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell&quot;, written and directed by Robert Culp. The episode&#x27;s story concerns a KGB mole-agent (played by guest star Dixie Carter) placed into the FBI with the sole purpose of discovering the methods used by agent Bill Maxwell in catching spies and other assorted villains. Cannell gave Culp free rein to produce the episode.

This was also the first of Cannell&#x27;s series to feature the &quot;Stephen J. Cannell Productions&quot; logo. The production company&#x27;s first series &quot;Tenspeed and Brown Shoe&quot; did not feature the logo.

===Theme song===

The theme song (and variants of it) have been used frequently outside of the show. &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; was composed by Mike Post (music) and Stephen Geyer (lyrics) and sung by Joey Scarbury. The theme song became well known during the show&#x27;s run. &quot;Believe it or Not&quot; debuted in the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 2. It also peaked at the No. 1 position on the &quot;Record World&quot; chart.

===Superman and Green Lantern connections===
The powers of the red suit were somewhat general, but still were similar enough to the abilities of Superman that Warner Bros., the owners of DC Comics, filed a lawsuit against ABC. &quot;Warner Bros. Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.&quot; was ultimately dismissed. However, the series has more inspiration owed to another DC property, Green Lantern, in that it shares the basic concept of an ordinary human being given a powerful weapon granting extraordinary abilities by extraterrestrials, including the later appearance in the series of an alien who is loosely reminiscent of the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; administrators, the Guardians of the Universe. It also shares the same concept of another DC property, Starman, in that it shares the basic concept of an ordinary human being is given a red costume, and given a powerful weapon granting extraordinary abilities by extraterrestrials. The series is also very similar to Nova from Marvel Comics, in that it shares the basic concept of an ordinary person attending school being given a powerful weapon granting extraordinary abilities by extraterrestrials, including the later appearance in the series of an alien who is loosely reminiscent of the Nova Corps&#x27; administrators, the Xandarians. The concept was also very similar to Frog-Man, a former supervillain, and now one of Spider-Man&#x27;s allies, as well as the superhero by the name of Ant-Man, Scott Lang (all three of them, also created by Marvel Comics), to which a non-superpowered person attending school is given a red costume that grants them extraordinary abilities and superpowers to fight off crime and bring evil to justice.

In the pilot episode, while Ralph ponders whether to accept the suit, he observes his son watching the &quot;Super Friends&quot; cartoon. Batman is heard to say, &quot;We need one more Super Friend who can fly!&quot; In a later scene, having yet to convince Pam he really is a superhero, Ralph jokes, &quot;Look at it this way. You&#x27;re one step ahead of Lois Lane: she never found out who Clark Kent really was.&quot; In &quot;Saturday on Sunset Boulevard&quot;, Ralph needs to change his clothing quickly. Seeing a telephone booth, he grumbles, &quot;No! Never!&quot;, but ends up using it. Later, while Ralph struggles to get changed in the back of Bill&#x27;s car, Bill notes &quot;We need to get you a bigger phone booth.&quot;

==Revivals==

===&quot;The Greatest American Heroine&quot;===
During 1986, the original principal cast reunited for a pilot movie for a new NBC series to be named &quot;The Greatest American Heroine&quot;, which did not result in a new series, and the pilot was never broadcast by NBC. Ultimately, the pilot was re-edited as an episode of the original series (complete with original opening credits and theme), and added to syndication sets of the original series aired on several local television stations in the late 1980s, for which it is the final episode. Immediately after the beginning credits, the episode&#x27;s title card is superimposed over a nighttime view of the Los Angeles skyline, reading &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; before appending the letters &quot;i n e&quot; individually to the sound of the NBC chimes. The chimes were a nod to NBC and its president, Brandon Tartikoff, who had expressed interest in reviving the series.

The pilot movie reveals that, several years after the final episode, Ralph&#x27;s secret identity was finally revealed to the public, resulting in his becoming a celebrity. This angers the aliens who gave him the suit, and they charge him with finding a new hero to wear the costume and use its powers for fighting evil. Once the transfer is made, they explain, all memory of Ralph&#x27;s exploits will be purged from the world&#x27;s memory and remembered only by Ralph, Pam, and Bill.

Bill begins their search by researching people with desired hero qualities, but Ralph finds a young woman named Holly Hathaway (Mary Ellen Stuart), an elementary school teacher who spends her off-hours time looking for lost kittens, raising environmental awareness, and serving as a foster mother. Bill, Pam, and Ralph meet in the desert, where Ralph tells Bill about Holly. He reacts visibly to his new partner being a &quot;skirt&quot; before Holly arrives, flying in wearing a new version of the suit made for her, and she pledges to help Bill. The original trio say their final farewells, and even the stoic Maxwell reveals his true emotions as he says goodbye to Ralph and calling Pam a trouper—&quot;...one of the best!&quot; Holly reacts emotionally to the fond farewells, but breaks the sombre mood as she accidentally pulls the door off of Bill&#x27;s sedan.

The rest of the episode deals with Holly learning how to use the suit with Bill Maxwell&#x27;s guidance, and the pair trying to develop a working relationship. It ends with Bill overhearing a conversation between Holly and her foster daughter in which Holly refers to Bill as a good person. Bill is then shown speaking into a recorder he uses as his &quot;diary&quot; to suggest that maybe Holly is the right person to wear the suit after all.
===Remake===
On August 29, 2014, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; published an article reporting that the Fox Network had ordered a pilot for a new version of the show. The pilot was to be produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, both of whom wrote and directed &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;.

Deadline reported on September 8, 2017, that Rachna Fruchbom and Nahnatchka Khan would produce a female-led remake for 20th Century Fox TV and ABC Studios. The suit was to be donned by Meera, an Indian-American woman. Actress Hannah Simone was cast as the lead for the reboot.

On February 12, 2018, Simone was announced as the lead in ABC&#x27;s reboot; however, ABC declined to pick up the series.

==Comics==
During July 2008, it was announced that Katt was writing a comic book series based on the television series for his publishing company, Catastrophic Comics, in conjunction with Arcana Studios. The three-issue mini-series debuted later that year, featuring an updated retelling of the original pilot episode set in the present. Katt also contributes to the show&#x27;s Facebook page.

<doc id="555728" wikidata="Q8020979" url="?curid=555728" title="Williams Arena">
<text>Williams Arena is an indoor arena located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is the home arena for the University of Minnesota&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. It also housed the men&#x27;s hockey team until 1993, when it moved into its own building, 3M Arena at Mariucci. The building is popularly known as The Barn, and its student section is known as &quot;The Barnyard&quot;.

Williams Arena is located on the southwest corner of the intersection of University Avenue and 19th Ave. SE in Minneapolis on the university&#x27;s East Bank campus. It is in a neighborhood called Stadium Village, named for the old Memorial Stadium that stood there until its demolition in 1992. The arena is adjacent to Huntington Bank Stadium, 3M Arena at Mariucci and Ridder Arena, where the football and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams respectively play.

==History==
When the Gophers basketball team first organized, they played games in the on-campus YMCA. In 1896, the team moved into the campus Armory, a large building with gymnasium space for the team to use, even if basketball was not its primary purpose. The Gophers remained in the Armory for almost 30 years. Halfway through the 1924–25 season, coach Harold Taylor moved the team from the University Armory to the Kenwood Armory in downtown Minneapolis. This significantly increased the attendance: capacity at the University Armory was 2,000, but it was 6,500 at Kenwood. The team only played at Kenwood for a few seasons, however, as the University of Minnesota Field House (later known as Williams Arena) opened partway through the 1927–1928 season. The team moved in on January 31, 1928.
Initially known as the Minnesota Field House (a name now used for a different building), Williams Arena opened in 1928. The original construction of the arena cost $650,000. The arena was remodeled in 1950, and renamed Williams Arena after Henry L. Williams, the football coach from 1900 to 1921.

As part of the 1950 renovation, it was divided into two separate arenas within one building: a larger one for basketball and a smaller one for hockey. Both arenas were called Williams Arena until March 2, 1985, when the hockey section was renamed Mariucci Arena after longtime Gopher hockey coach John Mariucci. The hockey team moved into a new building across the street from Williams in 1993, also named Mariucci Arena. The old Mariucci Arena within Williams was remodeled into the Sports Pavilion, now the Maturi Pavilion, named for former University of Minnesota athletic director Joel Maturi in August 2017. which houses the volleyball, wrestling, and gymnastic teams.

The venue hosted the 1951 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament championship game and the 1964 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament Mideast Regional. Williams Arena has hosted the 1st and 2nd rounds of the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2005, 2007, and 2010. The hockey portion of Williams hosted the Frozen Four in 1958 and 1966. The Minnesota Lynx played all of their 2017 postseason home games at Williams Arena, ultimately winning the franchise&#x27;s fourth WNBA championship in the building.

Williams Arena was used for the filming of scenes in the 1978 film, &quot;Ice Castles&quot;.

==Design==

The building has an arched roof, in the same manner as an airplane hangar. The double arch steel beams allows an open space for the bleachers and floor. There are some seats with partially obscured views due to the upper deck extending past the trusses. Over the summer of 2012, a new Daktronics videoboard and fascia displays were installed as part of a sporting facility update, replacing the older board. The new board is 11&#x27;7&quot;x13&#x27;8&quot; with LED rings above and below the main display. The fascia extends 360° around the arena.

===Raised floor===
Williams Arena features an unusual raised floor design. The court surface is raised above the ground approximately two feet so that team benches and scorer&#x27;s table are below the court. The same goes for fans with the first row, who look at players at about knee-level. Normally, other than the officials and those players actively playing, only head coaches are allowed to be on the court itself. The raised floor is one of only a few remaining in the United States and contributes to the historic aura of the 90-year-old arena. This served as the inspiration for the NCAA Tournament&#x27;s Final Four, which in recent years has often set its court above the stadium floor. 

The floor in Williams Arena was changed in 2009, replacing the original playing surface from 1928 with a new floor along with new baskets. This was the first major upgrade to the facility since a renovation occurred in the early 1990s. Memorial Gymnasium at Vanderbilt University and Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University are two other existing arenas with a raised floor.

=== Seating capacity ===
From 1950 until the opening of Marriott Center at Brigham Young University in 1971, it had the largest capacity of any collegiate basketball arena in the country. Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University also was constructed in 1928, and held the honor of being the highest capacity arena until the remodeling of Williams Arena in 1950.

<text>A plumbing fixture is an exchangeable device which can be connected to a plumbing system to deliver and drain water.

==Common fixtures==
===Supply===
The most common plumbing fixtures are:
*Bathtubs
*Bidets
*Channel drains
*Drinking fountains
*Showers
*Sinks
*Tap (connections for water hoses)
**Tapware - an industry term for that sub-category of plumbing fixtures consisting of tap valves, also called water taps (British English) or faucets (American English), and their accessories, such as water spouts and shower heads.
*Terminal valves for dishwashers, ice makers, humidifiers, etc.
*Urinals
*Toilets
**Flush toilets

===Waste===
Each of these plumbing fixtures has one or more water outlets and a drain. In some cases, the drain has a device that can be manipulated to block the drain to fill the basin of the fixture. Each fixture also has a &quot;flood rim&quot;, or level at which water will begin to overflow. Most fixtures also have an overflow, which is a conduit for water to drain away, when the regular drain is plugged, before the water actually overflows at the flood rim level. However, water closets and showers (that are not in bathtubs) usually lack this feature because their drains normally cannot be stopped.

Each fixture usually has a characteristic means of connection. Normal plumbing practice is to install a valve on each water supply line before the fixture, and this is most commonly termed a &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;service valve&quot;. The water supply to some fixtures is cold water only (such as water closets and urinals). Most fixtures also have a hot water supply. In some occasional cases, a sink may have both a potable (drinkable) and a non-potable water supply.

Lavatories and water closets normally connect to the water supply by means of a &quot;supply&quot;, which is a tube, usually of nominal 3/8 in (United States) or 10 or 12 mm diameter (Europe and Middle East), which connects the water supply to the fixture, sometimes through a flexible (braided) hose. For water closets, this tube usually ends in a flat neoprene washer that tightens against the connection, while for lavatories, the supply usually ends in a conical neoprene washer. Kitchen sinks, tubs and showers usually have supply tubes built onto their valves which then are soldered or &#x27;fast jointed&#x27; directly onto the water supply pipes.

====Drains====
The actual initial drain part in a lavatory or sink is termed a &quot;strainer&quot;. If there is a removable strainer device that fits into the fixed strainer, it is termed a &quot;strainer basket&quot;. The initial pipe that leads from the strainer to the trap is termed the &quot;tailpiece&quot;.

Floor-mounted water closets seal to the toilet flange of the drain pipe by means of a wax ring. These are traditionally made out of beeswax. However, their proper sealing depends on proper seating of the water closet, on a firm and secure base (floor), and on proper installation of the closet bolts which secure the closet to the flange, which is in turn supposed to be securely fastened to the floor.

====Traps and vents====
All plumbing fixtures have traps in their drains; these traps are either internal or external to the fixtures. Traps are pipes which curve down then back up; they &quot;trap&quot; a small amount of water to create a water seal between the ambient air space and the inside of the drain system. This prevents sewer gas from entering buildings. 

Most water closets, bidets, and many urinals have the trap integral with the fixture itself. The visible water surface in a toilet is the top of the trap&#x27;s water seal.

Each fixture drain, with exceptions, must be vented so that negative air pressure in the drain cannot siphon the trap dry, to prevent positive air pressure in the sewer from forcing gases past the water seal, and to prevent explosive sewer gas buildup.

==Electronic plumbing==
In public facilities, the trend is toward sensor-operated (automatic) fixtures that improve hygiene and save money. For example, sensor operated automatic-flush urinals have fewer moving parts, reduce wear, and tend to last longer than manual-flush valves. Also, they ensure fixtures are flushed only once per use. Some contain intelligence that flushes them at different amounts of water flow depending on traffic patterns: e.g.&quot;,&quot; the fixture can detect a lineup of users and only give a full flush after the last person has used the urinal. For the same purpose, dual-flush toilets are also becoming more popular. A combination of both technologies can allow for saved power and water.

Automatic flush compensates for users who do not bother to flush. Also, since the fixtures are always flushed, there is no need for a urinal cake, or other odor reduction. Sensor-operated toilets also have automatic flush. Sensor-operated faucets and showers save water. For example, while a user is lathering up with soap, the fixture shuts off and then resumes when the user needs it to. Sensor-operated soap and shampoo dispensers reduce waste and spills that might otherwise represent a slippage hazard.

However, many people, especially children, dislike or even fear automatic flush toilets, since they have the tendency to flush without warning, even while the user is still sitting on the toilet. Some parents have started keeping track of public bathrooms that have manual flush toilets, or even carrying post-it notes or other devices with them to temporarily disable the automatic flush sensor.

These fixtures typically cost more to install than conventional plumbing fixtures, because they require the services (or presence) of both a licensed plumber and a licensed electrician. Construction companies on cost-plus contracts may actually favor these fixtures for this reason, although their clients may not. The additional complexity of these fixtures also complicates repairs, particularly the diagnosis of malfunctions causing unexpected flushing. Few electricians, and fewer plumbers, understand microelectronics well enough for complex diagnosis.

==Standardization==

Some widely used standards for plumbing fittings and accessories located between the supply stop and the terminal fitting area are:

* A112.18.1 Plumbing Supply Fittings Standard, American Society of Mechanical Engineers
* A112.18.2 Plumbing Waste Fittings Standard, American Society of Mechanical Engineers

<doc id="555733" wikidata="Q3018202" url="?curid=555733" title="David Kirke">
<text>Sir David Kirke ( – ) was an English privateer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of Newfoundland from 1638 to 1651. He is best known for capturing Québec from the French in 1629 during the Anglo-French War. A favourite of Charles I of England, Kirke&#x27;s downfall came in 1651 when he was arrested after being accused of witholding taxes collected on behalf of the English government. Kirke was sent back to England, where he reportedly died in prison. 

==Early life==

Kirke was a son of Gervase (Jarvis) Kirke, a rich merchant of the City of London, and Elizabeth Goudon, a French Huguenot woman. He was raised in Dieppe, in Normandy. David was the eldest of five sons, followed by Lewis, Thomas, John and James.

While still in England, David married to Sara Kirke. They left for Newfoundland in 1638 and had a number of children, including their sons George, David the Younger, and Phillip.

==Quebec campaign==

An English fleet, consisting of six warships and three pinnaces, left Gravesend, Kent in March 1629 with Jacques Michel, a deserter from Samuel Champlain, to act as pilot on the St. Lawrence River. Champlain sent a party from Quebec, whose residents were on the point of starvation, to meet an expected French relief fleet under . Unknown to Champlain, Caën was also bringing word that in April peace had been declared in Europe by the Treaty of Susa. Although Champlain&#x27;s party met Caën in the Gulf, they were captured by the English on their way upriver to Quebec. Kirke, now aware of the desperate conditions facing the Quebecers, sent his brothers Lewis and Thomas to demand a French surrender. Having no alternative, Champlain surrendered on 19 July 1629. 

However, Champlain argued that the seizure of Quebec by the Kirkes was unlawful, as the war had already ended; and he worked to have the colony returned to France. As part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the Anglo-French War, in 1632 Charles I of England agreed to return the lands in exchange for Louis XIII paying his wife&#x27;s dowry. These terms were signed into law with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1632. The lands in Quebec and Acadia were returned to the French Company of One Hundred Associates. 

Kirke had brought to Quebec an enslaved boy born in Madagascar, and before leaving the colony in July 1632 to return to England, he sold the slave to French clerk Olivier Le Baillif, who had collaborated with the English during the occupation. Baillif purchased the slave for 50 &quot;écus&quot;, the equivalent of half a year of wages for a skilled worker, and in 1633 baptised him as Olivier Le Jeune. After returning to England, Kirke was knighted as a consolation in 1633.

==Governor of Newfoundland==
Kirke is believed to have visited Ferryland, as he published a report on the island of Newfoundland in 1635. He was impressed by the island&#x27;s fisheries, and in 1637 he asked King Charles for a land grant. In November 1637 Kirke and his partners were granted a royal charter for co-proprietorship of the entire island. A portion of Newfoundland, the Avalon Peninsula, had already been granted to George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, but he was accused of abandoning his colony before his death in 1632, and the lands were transferred to Kirke. The charter of this new grant had stipulations designed to reduce conflict with migratory fishermen; there was to be no settlement within six miles of the shore, fishing rooms were not to be occupied before the arrival of the summer fishing crews, and a five per cent tax was to be collected on all fish products taken by foreigners.

Kirke was installed as the Proprietary Governor and arrived in 1638 with one hundred colonists. The original governorship of the Avalon Peninsula had passed to Baltimore&#x27;s son, Cecilius Calvert, who had installed William Hill as governor.

Kirke seized the governor&#x27;s mansion, then occupied by Hill. In January 1638, the king also granted Kirke a coat of arms, &quot;For the greater honour and splendour of that Countrey and the people therein inhabiting … to be used in all such cases as Armes are wont to be by other nations and Countries.&quot; In 1639, Kirke renamed the colony the Pool Plantation. Over the next several years, he built forts at Ferryland, St. John’s, and Bay de Verde. He collected tolls from all fishing vessels.

Kirke was granted the rights to &quot;the sole trade of the Newfoundland, the Fishing excepted.&quot; The latter words resulted in considerable trouble. At the time the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were being fished by many European nations, and Kirke&#x27;s 5% tax gave an advantage to the English fishermen in the area. A number of West Country merchants thrived on the fish trade. Represented in London by Kirke, Barkeley, and Company, with several of his brothers in control, Kirke used his land rights to support the fish trade, in conflict with the terms of his charter. By 1638, strong links between Ferryland and Dartmouth, Devon, had already been established. Kirke brought the entire trade network south of St. John&#x27;s under the control of a growing family commercial empire.

These actions aroused strong animosity from the West Country merchants. The planters and migratory fishermen agreed that Kirke was reserving the best fishing rooms for himself and his friends. In addition, he was accused of opening taverns, which were disruptive to the settlers&#x27; work. But before these charges could be investigated, in 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the king and parliament.

==Arrest and death==
The Civil War ended in 1651, and the Kirkes, as royalists, were on the losing side. Although the merchants&#x27; complaints were put aside during the war, they were revived at the end of it, and the Kirkes were no longer protected by the crown.

In 1651 a team of six commissioners, led by Maryland merchant John Treworgie, was sent to Ferryland to seize Kirke and bring him to England to stand trial. His lands were acquired by the Commonwealth of England. Found not guilty, in 1653 Kirke re-purchased the title to his lands. His wife, Dame Sara Kirke, returned to Newfoundland to oversee his business and reclaim his property, but Cecil Calvert, Lord Baltimore, brought new charges against Kirke over the title of the lands around Ferryland. Kirke is thought to have died in the original Southwark jail, The Clink, as early as January 1654, while awaiting trial.

Treworgie was granted the governorship of Newfoundland in 1653; he was already in Ferryland, apparently never having left after 1651. The next year, he and two other commissioners were arrested by James Kirke for holding possession of lands rightfully owned by the Kirkes, and an unpaid debt of £1,100. Treworgie maintained that Kirke&#x27;s possessions had been returned to his wife, but was found guilty in a first trial. A personal plea to Cromwell resulted in a second trial. The outcome is lost, but it appears that Treworgie was found not guilty, as he continued to serve as governor until 1660. In 1660, Treworgie returned to England to ask for another term as governor and for six year&#x27;s salary he claimed he was owed. He never returned to Newfoundland.

== Aftermath ==
After David&#x27;s death, Lady Sara Kirke and her sons took control over the Pool Plantation for the next decades.

The restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 re-opened the debate between the Kirkes and the Calverts over the ownership of the Avalon Peninsula. This time, Cecil Calvert was successful in gaining the royal patent on Avalon, but he never took up residence. David Kirke&#x27;s brother, now Sir Lewis Kirke, demanded compensation for improvements made at Ferryland by the Kirkes. Lady Kirke petitioned Charles II to make Lewis&#x27;s nephew George Kirke the governor of Newfoundland, an arrangement suggested by the Newfoundlanders, but the king demurred from appointing a resident governor.

The grant of arms to Kirke was lost during the Civil War. During the aftermath of World War I, the Imperial War Graves Commission in Europe asked what arms should mark the graves of soldiers from Newfoundland. During the subsequent investigations, the Kirke arms were found in the College of Heralds. In 1928, they were adopted as the official coat of arms of Newfoundland and continue to be used today by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

<text>Earl of Aldborough, of the Palatinate of Upper Ormond, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland held by the Stratford family. It was created on 9 February 1777, along with the courtesy title of Viscount Amiens, for John Stratford, 1st Viscount Aldborough, a descendant of the English Stratford family. He had already been created Baron Baltinglass, of Baltinglass, in the County of Wicklow, on 21 May 1763, and Viscount Aldborough, of the Palatinate of Upper Ormond, on 22 July 1776. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. Three of his sons, the second, third and fourth Earls, all succeeded in the titles. They became extinct on the death of the latter&#x27;s grandson, the sixth Earl, in 1875.

<doc id="555743" wikidata="Q1740614" url="?curid=555743" title="3M Arena at Mariucci">
<text>3M Arena at Mariucci ( ) or 3M Arena is the home arena for the Minnesota Golden Gophers men&#x27;s ice hockey team of the University of Minnesota. The arena is located on the Minneapolis campus and seats approximately 10,000 fans (9,600 in the main bowl plus club room and suite seating). The arena opened in 1993 and is named after John Mariucci, the longtime Gopher coach who is considered the &quot;godfather of Minnesota hockey.&quot; Under the gate is a quote from Mariucci: &quot;Through these gates walk the greatest fans in college hockey.&quot; The ice sheet was Olympic sized () from 1993 to 2023, when construction began on reducing the rink floor size. The women&#x27;s ice hockey team played at Mariucci from 1997 until 2002 when they moved to Ridder Arena, which is connected to Mariucci via a tunnel.

==Features==
Mariucci Arena has been host to prominent regional, national, and international competitions, including the 2005 and 2009 West Regional of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship, the 2006 NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Ice Hockey Tournament, and the 2006 World Short Track speed skating event. 3M Arena also hosted the inaugural Women&#x27;s Frozen Four on March 23 and March 25, 2001.

The Minnesota State High School League state hockey tournament holds its consolation bracket at Mariucci. On March 19, 2022, 10,774 fans watched the Gophers take on the Michigan Wolverines in the B1G Tournament Championship Game, the largest crowd to watch a game at Mariucci Arena.

From 1950 to 1993 the hockey team played in the hockey arena section of Williams Arena. That arena was renamed Mariucci Arena in 1985. People now generally refer to that as the &quot;old&quot; Mariucci Arena.

In 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated on Campus&quot; named Mariucci Arena one of the top ten venues in college sports. The facility was the only ice hockey arena to make the list.

Before the 2012-13 hockey season, the University of Minnesota upgraded Mariucci Arena, which saw the replacement of the old scoreboard with a new state of the art Daktronics videoboard and the addition of a fascia display that rings the arena.

In May 2014, a proposal for an $8 million renovation to the arena was announced. The renovations would include reducing the ice sheet to approximately , increased seating capacity, improved sightlines and an upgraded weight room. The proposed renovation would be funded privately. The reduced-size playing surface would allow for playing style to be more similar to the NHL, which has a standard .

On July 10, 2017, Maplewood-based 3M bought the naming rights of Mariucci Arena for for 14 years.

In September 2020, the arena was again renovated by Gopher Athletics. The renovation spanned 11,000 square feet and included a new training center, a new &#x27;M&#x27; Club alumni room and a remodeled office suite.

Ice surface reduction and renovation finally began with removal of the concrete arena rink base shortly after the March 18, 2023, Big Ten championship game.

<doc id="555745" wikidata="Q864589" url="?curid=555745" title="Schwarzian derivative">
<text>In mathematics, the Schwarzian derivative is an operator similar to the derivative which is invariant under Möbius transformations. Thus, it occurs in the theory of the complex projective line, and in particular, in the theory of modular forms and hypergeometric functions. It plays an important role in the theory of univalent functions, conformal mapping and Teichmüller spaces. It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Schwarz.

==Definition==
The Schwarzian derivative of a holomorphic function of one complex variable is defined by

:formula_1

The same formula also defines the Schwarzian derivative of a function of one real variable.
The alternative notation

:formula_2

is frequently used.

==Properties==
The Schwarzian derivative of any Möbius transformation

: formula_3

is zero. Conversely, the Möbius transformations are the only functions with this property. Thus, the Schwarzian derivative precisely measures the degree to which a function fails to be a Möbius transformation.

If is a Möbius transformation, then the composition has the same Schwarzian derivative as ; and on the other hand, the Schwarzian derivative of is given by the chain rule

: formula_4
More generally, for any sufficiently differentiable functions and 

: formula_5
When and are smooth real-valued functions, this implies that all iterations of a function with negative (or positive) Schwarzian will remain negative (resp. positive), a fact of use in the study of one-dimensional dynamics.

Introducing the function of two complex variables

:formula_6

its second mixed partial derivative is given by

:formula_7

and the Schwarzian derivative is given by the formula:

:formula_8

The Schwarzian derivative has a simple inversion formula, exchanging the dependent and the independent variables. One has

:formula_9

or more explicitly, formula_10. This follows from the chain rule above.

=== Geometric interpretation ===
William Thurston interprets the Schwarzian derivative as a measure of how much a conformal map deviates from a Möbius transformation. Let formula_11 be a conformal mapping in a neighborhood of formula_12 Then there exists a unique &quot;Möbius transformation&quot; formula_13 such that formula_14 has the same 0, 1, 2-th order derivatives at formula_15

Now formula_16 To explicitly solve for formula_17 it suffices to solve the case of formula_18 Let formula_19formula_20 and solve for the formula_21 that make the first three coefficients of formula_22 equal to formula_23 Plugging it into the fourth coefficient, we get formula_24.

After a translation, rotation, and scaling of the complex plane, formula_25formula_26 in a neighborhood of zero. Up to third order this function maps the circle of radius formula_27 to the parametric curve defined by formula_28 where formula_29 This curve is, up to fourth order, an ellipse with semiaxes formula_30 and 

formula_31

as formula_32

Since Möbius transformations always map circles to circles or lines, the eccentricity measures the deviation of formula_11 from a Möbius transform.

==Differential equation==
Consider the linear second-order ordinary differential equation
formula_34
where formula_35 is a real-valued function of a real parameter formula_36. Let formula_37 denote the two-dimensional space of solutions. For formula_38, let formula_39 be the evaluation functional formula_40. The map formula_41 gives, for each point formula_36 of the domain of formula_37, a one-dimensional linear subspace of formula_37. That is, the kernel defines a mapping from the real line to the real projective line. The Schwarzian of this mapping is well-defined, and in fact is equal to formula_45 .

Owing to this interpretation of the Schwarzian, if two diffeomorphisms of a common open interval into formula_46 have the same Schwarzian, then they are (locally) related by an element of the general linear group acting on the two-dimensional vector space of solutions to the same differential equation, i.e., a fractional linear transformation of formula_46.

Alternatively, consider the second-order linear ordinary differential equation in the complex plane
:formula_48

Let formula_49 and formula_50 be two linearly independent holomorphic solutions. Then the ratio formula_51 satisfies

:formula_52

over the domain on which formula_49 and formula_50 are defined, and formula_55 The converse is also true: if such a exists, and it is holomorphic on a simply connected domain, then two solutions formula_56 and formula_57 can be found, and furthermore, these are unique up to a common scale factor.

When a linear second-order ordinary differential equation can be brought into the above form, the resulting is sometimes called the Q-value of the equation.

Note that the Gaussian hypergeometric differential equation can be brought into the above form, and thus pairs of solutions to the hypergeometric equation are related in this way.

==Conditions for univalence==
If is a holomorphic function on the unit disc, , then W. Kraus (1932) and Nehari (1949) proved that a necessary condition for to be univalent is

:formula_58

Conversely if is a holomorphic function on satisfying

:formula_59

then Nehari proved that is univalent.

In particular a sufficient condition for univalence is

:formula_60

==Conformal mapping of circular arc polygons==

The Schwarzian derivative and associated second-order ordinary differential equation can be used to determine the Riemann mapping between the upper half-plane or unit circle and any bounded polygon in the complex plane, the edges of which are circular arcs or straight lines. For polygons with straight edges, this reduces to the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping, which can be derived directly without using the Schwarzian derivative. The &quot;accessory parameters&quot; that arise as constants of integration are related to the eigenvalues of the second-order differential equation. Already in 1890 Felix Klein had studied the case of quadrilaterals in terms of the Lamé differential equation.

Let be a circular arc polygon with angles formula_61 in clockwise order. Let be a holomorphic map extending continuously to a map between the boundaries. Let the vertices correspond to points formula_62 on the real axis. Then is real-valued when is real and different from all the points . By the Schwarz reflection principle extends to a rational function on the complex plane with a double pole at :

:formula_63

The real numbers are called &quot;accessory parameters&quot;. They are subject to three linear constraints:

:formula_64
:formula_65
:formula_66

which correspond to the vanishing of the coefficients of formula_67 and formula_68 in the expansion of around . The mapping can then be written as

:formula_69

where formula_70 and formula_71 are linearly independent holomorphic solutions of the linear second-order ordinary differential equation

:formula_72

There are linearly independent accessory parameters, which can be difficult to determine in practise.

For a triangle, when , there are no accessory parameters. The ordinary differential equation is equivalent to the hypergeometric differential equation and is the Schwarz triangle function, which can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions.

For a quadrilateral the accessory parameters depend on one independent variable . Writing for a suitable choice of , the ordinary differential equation takes the form

:formula_73

Thus formula_74 are eigenfunctions of a Sturm–Liouville equation on the interval formula_75. By the Sturm separation theorem, the non-vanishing of formula_71 forces to be the lowest eigenvalue.

==Complex structure on Teichmüller space==
Universal Teichmüller space is defined to be the space of real analytic quasiconformal mappings of the unit disc , or equivalently the upper half-plane , onto itself, with two mappings considered to be equivalent if on the boundary one is obtained from the other by composition with a Möbius transformation. Identifying with the lower hemisphere of the Riemann sphere, any quasiconformal self-map of the lower hemisphere corresponds naturally to a conformal mapping of the upper hemisphere formula_77 onto itself. In fact formula_77 is determined as the restriction to the upper hemisphere of the solution of the Beltrami differential equation

:formula_79

where μ is the bounded measurable function defined by

:formula_80

on the lower hemisphere, extended to 0 on the upper hemisphere.

Identifying the upper hemisphere with , Lipman Bers used the Schwarzian derivative to define a mapping

:formula_81

which embeds universal Teichmüller space into an open subset of the space of bounded holomorphic functions on with the uniform norm. Frederick Gehring showed in 1977 that is the interior of the closed subset of Schwarzian derivatives of univalent functions.

For a compact Riemann surface of genus greater than 1, its universal covering space is the unit disc on which its fundamental group acts by Möbius transformations. The Teichmüller space of can be identified with the subspace of the universal Teichmüller space invariant under . The holomorphic functions have the property that

:formula_82

is invariant under , so determine quadratic differentials on . In this way, the Teichmüller space of is realized as an open subspace of the finite-dimensional complex vector space of quadratic differentials on .

==Diffeomorphism group of the circle==
===Crossed homomorphisms===
The transformation property

: formula_83

allows the Schwarzian derivative to be interpreted as a continuous 1-cocycle or crossed homomorphism of the diffeomorphism group of the circle with coefficients in the module of densities of degree 2 on the circle.
Let be the space of tensor densities of degree on . The group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of , acts on via pushforwards. If formula_84 then consider the mapping

:formula_85

In the language of group cohomology the chain-like rule above says that this mapping is a 1-cocycle on with coefficients in . In fact

:formula_86

and the 1-cocycle generating the cohomology is formula_87. The computation of 1-cohomology is a particular case of the more general result

:formula_88

Note that if is a group and a -module, then the identity defining a crossed homomorphism of into can be expressed in terms of standard homomorphisms of groups: it is encoded in a homomorphism of into the semidirect product formula_89 such that the composition of with the projection formula_89 onto is the identity map; the correspondence is by the map 

:formula_91

The crossed homomorphisms form a vector space and containing as a subspace the coboundary crossed homomorphisms 

:formula_92

in . A simple averaging argument shows that, if is a compact group and a topological vector space on which &quot;K&quot; acts continuously, then the higher cohomology groups vanish 

:formula_93 

In particular for 1-cocycles χ with

:formula_94

averaging over , using left invariant of the Haar measure on gives

:formula_95
with

:formula_96

Thus by averaging it may be assumed that satisfies the normalisation condition formula_97 for formula_98. Note that if any element in satisfies then 

:formula_99

But then, since is a homomorphism, 

:formula_100

so that satisfies the equivariance condition 

:formula_101

Thus it may be assumed that the cocycle satisfies these normalisation conditions for . The Schwarzian derivative in fact vanishes whenever is a Möbius transformation corresponding to . The other two 1-cycles discussed below vanish only on .

There is an infinitesimal version of this result giving a 1-cocycle for , the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields, and hence for the Witt algebra, the subalgebra of trigonometric polynomial vector fields. Indeed, when is a Lie group and the action of on is smooth, there is a Lie algebraic version of crossed homomorphism obtained by taking the corresponding homomorphisms of the Lie algebras (the derivatives of the homomorphisms at the identity). This also makes sense for and leads to the 1-cocycle

:formula_102

which satisfies the identity

:formula_103

In the Lie algebra case, the coboundary maps have the form 

:formula_104 

In both cases the 1-cohomology is defined as the space of crossed homomorphisms modulo coboundaries. The natural correspondence between group homomorphisms and Lie algebra homomorphisms leads to the &quot;van Est inclusion map&quot;

:formula_105

In this way the calculation can be reduced to that of Lie algebra cohomology. By continuity this reduces to the computation of crossed homomorphisms of the Witt algebra into . The normalisations conditions on the group crossed homomorphism imply the following additional conditions for :

:formula_106

for in .

Following the conventions of , a basis of the Witt algebra is given by

:formula_107

so that 

:formula_108

A basis for the complexification of is given by

:formula_109

so that

:formula_110
for formula_111. This forces 

:formula_112

for suitable coefficients . The crossed homomorphism condition 

:formula_113
gives a recurrence relation for the formula_114:

:formula_115

The condition 

:formula_116 

implies that formula_117. From this condition and the recurrence relation, it follows that up to scalar multiples, this has a unique non-zero solution when formula_118 and only the zero solution otherwise. The solution for formula_119 corresponds to the group 1-cocycle 

:formula_120 

The solution for formula_121 corresponds to the group 1-cocycle 

:formula_122 

The corresponding Lie algebra 1-cocycles for are given up to a scalar multiple by

:formula_123

===Central extensions===
The crossed homomorphisms in turn give rise to the central extension of and of its Lie algebra , the so-called Virasoro algebra.

===Coadjoint action===
The group and its central extension also appear naturally in the context of Teichmüller theory and string theory. In fact the homeomorphisms of induced by quasiconformal self-maps of are precisely the quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of ; these are exactly homeomorphisms which do not send four points with cross ratio 1/2 to points with cross ratio near 1 or 0. Taking boundary values, universal Teichmüller can be identified with the quotient of the group of quasisymmetric homeomorphisms by the subgroup of Möbius transformations . (It can also be realized naturally as the space of quasicircles in .) Since

:formula_124

the homogeneous space is naturally a subspace of universal Teichmüller space. It is also naturally a complex manifold and this and other natural geometric structures are compatible with those on Teichmüller space. The dual of the Lie algebra of can be identified with the space of Hill&#x27;s operators on 

:formula_125

and the coadjoint action of invokes the Schwarzian derivative. The inverse of the diffeomorphism sends the Hill&#x27;s operator to

:formula_126

==Pseudogroups and connections==
The Schwarzian derivative and the other 1-cocycle defined on can be extended to biholomorphic between open sets in the complex plane. In this case the local description leads to the theory of analytic pseudogroups, formalizing the theory of infinite-dimensional groups and Lie algebras first studied by Élie Cartan in the 1910s. This is related to affine and projective structures on Riemann surfaces as well as the theory of Schwarzian or projective connections, discussed by Gunning, Schiffer and Hawley.

A holomorphic pseudogroup on consists of a collection of biholomorphisms between open sets and in which contains the identity maps for each open , which is closed under restricting to opens, which is closed under composition (when possible), which is closed under taking inverses and such that if a biholomorphisms is locally in , then it too is in . The pseudogroup is said to be &quot;transitive&quot; if, given and in , there is a biholomorphism in such that . A particular case of transitive pseudogroups are those which are &quot;flat&quot;, i.e. contain all complex translations . Let be the group, under composition, of formal power series transformations with . A holomorphic pseudogroup defines a subgroup of , namely the subgroup defined by the Taylor series expansion about 0 (or &quot;jet&quot;) of elements of with . Conversely if is flat it is uniquely determined by : a biholomorphism on is contained in in if and only if the power series of lies in for every in : in other words the formal power series for at is given by an element of with replaced by ; or more briefly all the jets of lie in .

The group has a natural homomorphisms onto the group of -jets obtained by taking the truncated power series taken up to the term &quot;z&quot;&quot;k&quot;. This group acts faithfully on the space of polynomials of degree (truncating terms of order higher than &quot;k&quot;). Truncations similarly define homomorphisms of onto ; the kernel consists of maps &quot;f&quot; with , so is Abelian. Thus the group &quot;G&quot;&quot;k&quot; is solvable, a fact also clear from the fact that it is in triangular form for the basis of monomials.

A flat pseudogroup is said to be &quot;defined by differential equations&quot; if there is a finite integer such that homomorphism of into is faithful and the image is a closed subgroup. The smallest such is said to be the &quot;order&quot; of .
There is a complete classification of all subgroups that arise in this way which satisfy the additional assumptions that the image of in is a complex subgroup and that equals : this implies that the pseudogroup also contains the scaling transformations for , i.e. contains contains every polynomial with .

The only possibilities in this case are that and }; or that and . The former is the pseudogroup defined by affine subgroup of the complex Möbius group (the transformations fixing ); the latter is the pseudogroup defined by the whole complex Möbius group.

This classification can easily be reduced to a Lie algebraic problem since the formal Lie algebra formula_127 of consists of formal vector fields with &quot;F&quot; a formal power series. It contains the polynomial vectors fields with basis , which is a subalgebra of the Witt algebra. The Lie brackets are given by . Again these act on the space of polynomials of degree by differentiation—it can be identified with —and the images of give a basis of the Lie algebra of . Note that . Let formula_128 denote the Lie algebra of : it is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the Lie algebra of . It contains and is invariant under . Since formula_128 is a Lie subalgebra of the Witt algebra, the only possibility is that it has basis or basis for some . There are corresponding group elements of the form . Composing this with translations yields with . Unless , this contradicts the form of subgroup ; so .

The Schwarzian derivative is related to the pseudogroup for the complex Möbius group. In fact if is a biholomorphism defined on then is a quadratic differential on . If is a bihomolorphism defined on and and are quadratic differentials on ; moreover is a quadratic differential on , so that is also a quadratic differential on . The identity

:formula_130

is thus the analogue of a 1-cocycle for the pseudogroup of biholomorphisms with coefficients in holomorphic quadratic differentials. Similarly formula_131 and formula_132 are 1-cocycles for the same pseudogroup with values in holomorphic functions and holomorphic differentials. In general 1-cocycle can be defined for holomorphic differentials of any order so that

:formula_133

Applying the above identity to inclusion maps , it follows that ; and hence that if is the restriction of , so that , then . On the other hand, taking the local holomororphic flow defined by holomorphic vector fields—the exponential of the vector fields—the holomorphic pseudogroup of local biholomorphisms is generated by holomorphic vector fields. If the 1-cocycle satisfies suitable continuity or analyticity conditions, it induces a 1-cocycle of holomorphic vector fields, also compatible with restriction. Accordingly, it defines a 1-cocycle on holomorphic vector fields on :

:formula_134

Restricting to the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields with basis , these can be determined using the same methods of Lie algebra cohomology (as in the previous section on crossed homomorphisms). There the calculation was for the whole Witt algebra acting on densities of order , whereas here it is just for a subalgebra acting on holomorphic (or polynomial) differentials of order . Again, assuming that vanishes on rotations of , there are non-zero 1-cocycles, unique up to scalar multiples. only for differentials of degree 0, 1 and 2 given by the same derivative formula

where is a polynomial.

The 1-cocycles define the three pseudogroups by : this gives the scaling group (); the affine group (); and the whole complex Möbius group (). So these 1-cocycles are the special ordinary differential equations defining the pseudogroup. More significantly they can be used to define corresponding affine or projective structures and connections on Riemann surfaces. If is a pseudogroup of smooth mappings on , a topological space is said to have a -structure if it has a collection of charts that are homeomorphisms from open sets in to open sets in such that, for every non-empty intersection, the natural map from to lies in . This defines the structure of a smooth -manifold if consists of local diffeomorphisms and a Riemann surface if —so that —and consists of biholomorphisms. If is the affine pseudogroup, is said to have an affine structure; and if is the Möbius pseudogroup, is said to have a projective structure. Thus a genus one surface given as for some lattice has an affine structure; and a genus surface given as the quotient of the upper half plane or unit disk by a Fuchsian group has a projective structure.

Gunning in 1966 describes how this process can be reversed: for genus , the existence of a projective connection, defined using the Schwarzian derivative 2 and proved using standard results on cohomology, can be used to identify the universal covering surface with the upper half plane or unit disk (a similar result holds for genus 1, using affine connections and ).

== Generalizations ==
 describe a generalization that is applicable for mappings of conformal manifolds, in which the Schwarzian derivative becomes a symmetric tensor on the manifold. Let formula_13 be a smooth manifold of dimension formula_137 with a smooth metric tensor formula_138. A smooth diffeomorphism formula_139 is conformal if formula_140 for some smooth function formula_141. The Schwarzian is defined by
formula_142
where formula_143 is the Levi-Civita connection of formula_138, formula_145 denotes the Hessian with respect to the connection, formula_146 is the Laplace–Beltrami operator (defined as the trace of the Hessian with respect to formula_138).

The Schwarzian satisfies the cocycle law
formula_148
A Möbius transformation is a conformal diffeomorphism, whose conformal factor has vanishing Schwarzian. The collection of Möbius transformations of formula_13 is a closed Lie subgroup of the conformal group of formula_13. The solutions to formula_151 on Euclidean space, with formula_138 the Euclidean metric, are precisely when formula_141 is constant, the conformal factor giving the spherical metric formula_154, or else a conformal factor for a hyperbolic Poincaré metric on the ball or half-space formula_155 or formula_156 (respectively).

Another generalization applies to positive curves in a Lagrangian Grassmannian . Suppose that formula_157 is a symplectic vector space, of dimension formula_158 over formula_159. Fix a pair of complementary Lagrangian subspaces formula_160. The set of Lagrangian subspaces that are complemenary to formula_161 is parameterized by the space of mappings formula_162 that are symmetric with respect to formula_163 (formula_164 for all formula_165). Any Lagrangian subspace complementary to formula_161 is given by formula_167 for some such tensor formula_168. A curve is thus specified locally by a one-parameter family formula_169 of symmetric tensors. A curve is positive if formula_170 is positive definite. The Lagrangian Schwarzian is then defined as
formula_171
This has the property that formula_172 if and only if there is a symplectic transformation relating the curves formula_169 and formula_174.

The Lagrangian Schwarzian is related to a second order differential equation
formula_175
where formula_176 is a symmetric tensor, depending on a real variable formula_36 and formula_35 is a curve in formula_179. Let formula_37 be the formula_158-dimensional space of solutions of the differential equation. Since formula_182 is symmetric, the form on formula_37 given by formula_184 is independent of formula_36, and so gives formula_37 a symplectic structure. Let formula_39 the evaluation functional. Then for any formula_36 in the domain of formula_37, the kernel of formula_190 is a Lagrangian subspace of formula_37, and so the kernel defines a curve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian of formula_157. The Lagrangian Schwarzian of this curve is then formula_193.

<doc id="555747" wikidata="Q6609371" url="?curid=555747" title="List of chemical compounds with unusual names">
<text>Chemical nomenclature, replete as it is with compounds with very complex names, is a for some names that may be considered unusual. A browse through the &quot;Physical Constants of Organic Compounds&quot; in the &quot;CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics&quot; (a fundamental resource) will reveal not just the whimsical work of chemists, but the sometimes peculiar compound names that occur as the consequence of simple juxtaposition. Some names derive legitimately from their chemical makeup, from the geographic region where they may be found, the plant or animal species from which they are isolated or the name of the discoverer.

Some are given intentionally unusual trivial names based on their structure, a notable property or at the whim of those who first isolate them. However, many trivial names predate formal naming conventions. Trivial names can also be ambiguous or carry different meanings in different industries, geographic regions and languages.

Godly noted that &quot;Trivial names having the status of INN or ISO are carefully tailor-made for their field of use and are internationally accepted&quot;. In his preface to &quot;Chemical Nomenclature&quot;, Thurlow wrote that &quot;Chemical names do not have to be deadly serious&quot;. A website in existence since 1997 and maintained at the University of Bristol lists a selection of &quot;molecules with silly or unusual names&quot; strictly for entertainment. These so-called silly or funny trivial names (depending on culture) can also serve an educational purpose. In an article in the &quot;Journal of Chemical Education&quot;, Dennis Ryan argues that students of organic nomenclature (considered a &quot;dry and boring&quot; subject) may actually take an interest in it when tasked with the job of converting funny-sounding chemical trivial names to their proper systematic names.

The collection listed below presents a sample of trivial names and gives an idea how chemists are inspired when they coin a brand new name for a chemical compound outside of systematic naming. It also includes some examples of systematic names and acronyms that accidentally resemble English words.

== Elements ==

Glenn Seaborg told his students that he proposed the chemical symbol Pu (from ) instead of the conventional &quot;Pl&quot; for plutonium as a joke, only to find it officially adopted.
Unununium (Uuu) was the former temporary name of the chemical element number 111, a synthetic transuranium element. This element was named roentgenium (Rg) in November 2004.

<doc id="555748" wikidata="Q211351" url="?curid=555748" title="Mikveh">
<text>A mikveh or mikvah (,  &quot;mikva&#x27;ot&quot;, &quot;mikvot&quot;, or (Ashkenazic) &quot;mikves&quot;, lit., &quot;a collection&quot;) is a bath used for ritual immersion in Judaism to achieve ritual purity.

In Orthodox Judaism, these regulations are steadfastly adhered to; consequently, the mikveh is central to an Orthodox Jewish community. Conservative Judaism also formally holds to the regulations. The existence of a mikveh is considered so important that, according to halacha, a Jewish community is required to construct a kosher mikveh even before building a synagogue, and must go to the extreme of selling Torah scrolls, or even a synagogue if necessary, to provide funding for its construction.

==Etymology==
Formed from the Semitic root ק-ו-ה (&quot;q-w-h&quot;, &quot;collect&quot;). In the Hebrew Bible, the word is employed in the sense of &quot;collection&quot;, including in the phrase מקוה המים (&quot;miqwêh hammayim&quot;, &quot;collection of water&quot;) in Genesis 1:10; Exodus 7:19; and Leviticus 11:36. Ben Sira is the earliest author to use מקוה as a word for &quot;pool&quot; (Ecclus 43:20, 48:17), and the Mishnah is the earliest text to use it in the sense of &quot;ritual bath&quot;.

==History==

Before the beginning of the 1st century BCE, neither written sources nor archaeology gives any indication about the existence of specific installations used for ritual cleansing. Mikvot appear at the beginning of the 1st century BC, and from then on, ancient mikvot can be found throughout the Land of Israel, as well as in historic communities of the Jewish diaspora. Hundreds of mikvot from the Second Temple period have been discovered so far across the Land of Israel, in locations including Jerusalem, Hebron, Masada, and Hannaton.

The absence of dedicated mikvot prior to the 1st century BCE is surprising, given that laws of purification were in fact observed by many Jews in earlier periods, as indicated by Biblical narratives and the Elephantine papyri. One suggestion is that Jews used natural water sources such as springs for immersion, rather than building dedicated mikvot. Alternatively, according to many Halakhic authorities the prohibition on using pumped water for a &quot;mikveh&quot; is rabbinic, not biblical. Prior to the creation of such a rabbinic decree around 100 BCE, Jews may have immersed in above-ground basins that were built as part of buildings, or affixed to the roofs of buildings, and filled manually. Such structures, dating to the First Temple period, have been discovered in ancient Ashdod and possibly in Dan. The reason for such a rabbinic decree may have been to distance the practice of ritual immersion from the culture of bathhouses, which spread through the region during the Hellenistic period.

==Requirements==
The traditional rules regarding the construction of a mikveh are based on those specified in classical rabbinic literature. Numerous biblical laws indicate that one must &quot;bathe their flesh in water&quot; to become purified from ritual impurity. The type of bathing is specified in , which states that &quot;a spring, or a cistern, a gathering (&quot;mikveh&quot;) of water&quot; is a source of purity. A &quot;mikveh&quot; must be built into the ground or built as an essential part of a building. Portable receptacles, bathtubs, whirlpools, or jacuzzis cannot therefore function as mikvot.

===Water transport===
&quot;Mikveh&quot; water must have collected naturally (&quot;bidei shamayim&quot;) rather than by human action. Thus, &quot;mikveh&quot; water must flow naturally to the &quot;mikveh&quot; from the source (rain or a spring). This essentially means that it must be supplied by gravity or a natural pressure gradient and cannot be pumped there by hand or carried. As a result, tap water cannot be used as the primary water source for a mikveh, although it can be used to top the water up to a desired level provided the minimum amount (40 &quot;seah&quot;) of ritually appropriate water is in the &quot;mikveh&quot; first; in practice, this means that for a pool of at least 80 &quot;seahs&quot; (approximately 1,150 litres) the majority of its volume can be tap water. The water is also forbidden to pass through any vessel which could hold water within it or is capable of becoming impure (anything made of metal); however, pipes open to the air at both ends are fine so long as there is no significant curvature). Frozen water (snow, ice and hail) is exceptional in that it may be used to fill the &quot;mikveh&quot; no matter how it was transported.

Although not commonly accepted, at least one American Orthodox rabbi advocated a home &quot;mikveh&quot; using tap water, for those women who did not have access to a standard &quot;mikveh&quot;. As water flows through only pipes that open at both ends, the municipal and in-home plumbing would be construed as a non-vessel. So long as the pipes, hoses, and fittings are all freestanding and not held in the hand, they could be used to fill a &quot;mikveh&quot; receptacle that met all other requirements. The use of tap water for such a &quot;mikveh&quot; was controversial and was rejected by the majority of rabbinic authorities at the time and afterwards.

The laws for a &quot;mikveh&quot; are slightly different from those of a spring. &quot;Mikveh&quot; water must be at rest, while spring water can still be flowing. Thus, flowing rivers may only be used for immersion when most of their water comes from springs, rather than rainfall or snowmelt. Seas may be used (even if waves are present).

===Size and practical arrangements===
A mikveh must contain enough water to cover the entire body of an average-sized person; based on a mikveh with the dimensions of 3 cubits deep, 1 cubit wide, and 1 cubit long, the necessary volume of water was &quot;estimated&quot; as being 40 &quot;seah&quot; of water. The exact volume referred to by a &quot;seah&quot; is debated, and classical rabbinical literature specifies only that it is enough to fit 144 eggs; most Orthodox Jews use the stringent ruling of the Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, according to which one &quot;seah&quot; is 14.3 litres, and therefore a mikveh must contain at least some 575 litres. This volume of water can later be topped up with water from any source, but if there were less than 40 seahs of water in the mikveh to begin with, then the addition of 3 or more pints of water that did not meet the strict requirements would render the mikveh unfit for use, regardless of whether more water from a natural source was added later; a mikveh rendered unfit for use in this way would need to be completely drained away and refilled in the prescribed way.

Inasmuch as water that collects naturally according to halachic prescriptions is hard to come by in urban areas, various methods are employed to establish a valid mikveh. One is that tap water is made to flow into a kosher mikveh and through a conduit into a larger pool in which users actually bathe. A second method is to create a mikveh in a deep pool, place a floor with holes over that and then fill the upper pool with tap water. In this way, it is considered as if the person dipping is actually &quot;in&quot; the pool of rain water. Additionally, the &quot;hashoko&quot; method involves using two pools: one filled with at least 40 &quot;seahs&quot; of natural water and one filled with tap water. A hole at least wide on the wall of the pool filled with tap water connects it to the pool filled with natural water. When these two collections of water touch, the tap water pool is okay to use for ritual immersion.

Most contemporary mikvot are indoor constructions involving rainwater collected from a cistern and passed through a duct by gravity into an ordinary bathing pool; the mikveh can be heated to make the experience of bathing more comfortable, taking into account certain rules, often resulting in an environment not unlike a spa.

==Background==
===Laws===

Traditionally, the mikveh was used by both men and women to regain ritual purity after various events, according to regulations laid down in the Torah and in classical rabbinical literature.

Cases where Jews commonly immerse in a &quot;mikveh&quot; nowadays, in order to fulfill a requirement of Torah or rabbinic law, include:
* a woman who wishes to become purified from the status of niddah (menstruation) or the related status of zavah (abnormal discharges of body fluids). In particular, a married woman must immerse in order to resume marital relations with her husband after menstruation or childbirth. (The male equivalent of zavah, known as zav, cannot be purified in a &quot;mikveh&quot; but rather must immerse in running spring water.)
* one who is converting to Judaism, regardless of gender.
* Newly acquired utensils used in serving and eating food must be immersed (Tevilat Kelim).

Other cases where immersion in a &quot;mikveh&quot; would be required to become pure, but have not generally been practiced since destruction of the Temple (as a state of purity is generally not required outside the Temple), include:
* a man who has experienced keri (normal emissions of semen, whether from sexual activity, or from nocturnal emission). Immersing due to &quot;keri&quot; is required by the Torah in order that one should be allowed to eat terumah or a sacrifice; Ezra instituted that one should also do so in order to be allowed to recite words of Torah. The latter case is known as &quot;tevilath Ezra&quot; (&quot;the immersion of Ezra&quot;). In modern times it is no longer considered obligatory, but some perform it as a custom or act of piety.
* one who has come into contact with a &quot;niddah&quot; or &quot;zavah&quot;, or their clothes or articles
* after tzaraath
* a Kohen who is being consecrated
* the Kohen Gadol on goes to Mikvah five times on Yom Kippur;
* the Kohen who performed the red heifer ritual;
* one who has contacted a corpse or grave, in addition to having the ashes of the red heifer ritual sprinkled upon them;
* one who has eaten meat from an animal that died naturally.
* one who wishes to visit the Temple Mount (this is still practiced by some modern Jews whose rabbinic authorities follow a minority opinion to permit such visits)

===Customs===
Customs exist to immerse in a &quot;mikveh&quot; in some of the following circumstances, with the customs varying by community:
* By a bridegroom, on the day of his wedding
* By a father, prior to the circumcision of his son
* Before Yom Kippur, sometimes including married women as well as men
* Before Rosh Hashana
* By a kohen, prior to a service in which he will recite the Priestly Blessing
* Before a Jewish holiday, either as an extension of the custom of kohanim to immerse before holidays when they would recite the priestly blessing or in order to purify oneself before a holiday as was required in the times of the Temple.
* At some point during the ninth month of pregnancy
* Before each Shabbat, especially prevalent in Hasidic custom
* Every day, in Hasidic custom
* Some Jewish funeral homes have a mikveh for immersing a body during the purification procedure (&quot;taharah&quot;) before burial.

Immersion for men is more common in Hasidic communities, and done rarely in others, like German Jewish communities, where it is generally done only before the High Holidays.

==Requirements during use==

There is supposed to be no barrier between the person immersing and the water. The person should be wearing no clothes, jewelry, makeup, nail polish, fake nails, false eyelashes, contact lenses, or grooming products on the hair or skin. The person should carefully wash the hair and the body, removing calluses and dead skin prior. Some trim nails prior to immersion. Hair on the head and body is to be thoroughly combed, although exceptions are sometimes made for hair styled in dreadlocks. The mouth should be thoroughly cleaned and removable dental appliances are usually taken out. The person should carefully check their body after preparation, and sometimes an attendant will also check to ensure these requirements are met. Showering or bathing and carefully checking the whole body is, therefore, part of the religious requirements before entering the water of a mikveh. Although technically the requirements are the same for men and women, the common practice is that men do not go to great lengths to clean themselves before immersion since the immersion (with rare exceptions) is not Halakhically obligatory.

According to rabbinical tradition, the hair counts as part of the body, and therefore water is required to touch all parts of it, meaning that braids cannot be worn during immersion. This has resulted in debate between the various ethnic groups within Judaism, about whether hair combing is necessary before immersion. The Ashkenazi community generally supports the view that hair must be combed straight so that there are no knots, but some take issue with this stance, particularly when it comes to dreadlocks. A number of rabbinical rulings argue in support of dreadlocks, on the basis that
* dreadlocks can sometimes be loose enough to become thoroughly saturated with water, particularly if the person had first showered
* combing dreadlocked hair can be painful
* although a particularly cautious individual would consider a single knotted hair as an obstruction, in most cases hair is loose enough for water to pass through it unless each hair is individually knotted

==Modern practice==

===Orthodox Judaism===
Orthodox Judaism generally adheres to the classical regulations and traditions, and consequently Orthodox Jewish women are obligated to immerse in a mikveh between niddah and sexual relations with their husbands. This includes brides before their marriage, and married women after their menstruation period or childbirth.

In accordance with Orthodox rules concerning modesty, men and women immerse in separate mikveh facilities in different locations, or else use the mikveh at different designated times.

===Conservative Judaism===
In a series of responsa in 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism reaffirmed a requirement that Conservative women use a mikveh monthly following the end of the niddah period following menstruation, while adopting certain leniencies including reducing the length of the nidda period. The three responsa adopted permit a range of approaches from an opinion reaffirming the traditional ritual to an opinion declaring the concept of ritual purity does not apply outside the Temple in Jerusalem, proposing a new theological basis for the ritual, adapting new terminology including renaming the observances related to menstruation from &quot;taharat hamishpacha&quot; family purity to &quot;kedushat hamishpaha&quot; [family holiness] to reflect the view that the concept of ritual purity is no longer considered applicable, and adopting certain leniencies including reducing the length of the niddah period.

Isaac Klein&#x27;s &quot;A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice&quot;, a comprehensive guide frequently used within Conservative Judaism, also addresses Conservative views on other uses of a mikveh, but because it predates the 2006 opinions, it describes an approach more closely resembling the Orthodox one, and does not address the leniencies and views those opinions reflected. Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz&#x27;s recent book &quot;Taking the Plunge: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to the Mikveh&quot; (Jerusalem: Schechter Institute, 2007) offers a comprehensive discussion of contemporary issues and new mikveh uses along with traditional reasons for observance, details of how to prepare and what to expect, and how the laws developed. Conservative Judaism encourages, but does not require, immersion before Jewish Holidays (including Yom Kippur), nor the immersion of utensils purchased from non-Jews. New uses are being developed throughout the liberal world for healing (after rape, incest, divorce, etc.) or celebration (milestone birthdays, anniversaries, ordination, or reading Torah for the first time).

As in Orthodox Judaism, converts to Judaism through the Conservative movement are required to immerse themselves in a mikveh. Two Jews must witness the event, at least one of which must actually see the immersion. Immersion into a mikveh has been described as a very emotional, life-changing experience similar to a graduation.

===Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism do not hold the halachic requirements of mikveh the way Conservative and Orthodox Judaism do, but some Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis recommend a mikveh ceremony. However, there are growing trends toward using mikveh for conversions, wedding preparation, and even before holidays. In the 21st century the mikveh is experiencing a revival among progressive Jews who view immersion as a way to mark transitions in their lives. By 2001, the Central Conference of American Rabbis began to recommend a mikveh ceremony for converts.

&quot;Open&quot; mikvot welcome Jews to consider immersion for reasons not necessarily required by Jewish law; they might immerse following a divorce or medical treatment, to find closure after an abortion, or to celebrate a life transition, among other reasons. Progressive Jews may also use the mikveh for conversion.

==Interpretations==

Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan connects the laws of impurity to the narrative in the beginning of Genesis. According to Genesis, by eating of the fruit, Adam and Eve had brought death into the world. Kaplan points out that most of the laws of impurity relate to some form of death (or in the case of niddah the loss of a potential life). One who comes into contact with one of the forms of death must then immerse in water which is described in Genesis as flowing out of the Garden of Eden (the source of life) in order to cleanse oneself of this contact with death (and by extension of sin).

According to Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, by immersing in the mikveh, &quot;we are forced to recognize our existential estrangement from the physical universe. How long can we survive under water? The experience of submerging drives home the realization that our existence in this world is transient, and we should strive towards more lasting goals.&quot;

A custom exists to read the seventh chapter of the Mikvaot tractate of the Mishnah following a funeral. This tractate covers the laws of the mikveh, and the seventh chapter starts with a discussion of substances which can be used as valid water sources for a mikveh—snow, hail, frost, ice, salt, and pourable mud. This alludes to the belief in resurrection, as &quot;living water&quot; in a lifeless frozen state (as ice) can still become living water again (after melting).

===Allegory===
The word &quot;mikveh&quot; makes use of the same root letters in Hebrew as the word for &quot;hope&quot;, and this has served as the basis for homiletical comparison of the two concepts in both biblical and rabbinic literature. For instance, in the Book of Jeremiah, the word &quot;mikveh&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;hope&quot;, but at the same time also associated with &quot;living water&quot;:

In the Mishnah, following on from a discussion of Yom Kippur, Rabbi Akiva compares &quot;mikveh&quot; immersion to the relationship between God and Israel. Akiva refers to the description of God in the Book of Jeremiah as the &quot;Mikveh of Israel&quot;, and suggests that &quot;just as a mikveh purifies the contaminated, so does the Holy One, blessed is he, purify Israel&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Use by non-Orthodox converts===
The Reform Movement&#x27;s Israel Religious Action Center sued the state on behalf of the Reform and Conservative/Masorti movements to allow members to use publicly funded mikvot. The case, which took ten years to resolve, resulted in the Israeli Supreme Court ruling that public ritual baths must accept all prospective converts to Judaism, including converts to Reform and Conservative Judaism. In his 2016 ruling, Supreme Court Justice Elyakim Rubinstein said barring certain converts amounts to discrimination. Until this ruling, Orthodox officials barred non-Orthodox converts from using any mikveh, as their traditions do not technically conform to Jewish law, and the people they convert are therefore not technically Jews. Rubinstein noted: &quot;Once it established public mikvahs, and put them at the service of the public—including for the process of conversion—the State cannot but be even-handed in allowing their use.&quot; He also said. &quot;The State of Israel is free to supervise the use of its mikvahs, so long as it does so in an egalitarian manner.&quot;

===Intrusive questions===
In 2013, the Israeli Center for Women&#x27;s Justice and Kolech, an organization committed to Orthodox Jewish feminism, petitioned the Supreme Court to forbid attendants from asking intrusive questions of women at state-funded and -operated mikvot. In response, the Chief Rabbinate said it would forbid questioning of women about their marital status before immersion. The complaint had charged that the practice represented unacceptable discrimination. In 2015, however, the ITIM Advocacy Center filed a complaint with the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of 13 Orthodox women against the Chief Rabbinate and the Jerusalem Religious Council, insisting that women be allowed to use the mikvah &quot;according to their personal customs and without supervision, or with their own attendant if they wish&quot;. The complaint charged that the Chief Rabbinate is ignoring directives passed in 2013 that allow women to use the mikvah facilities without being asked intrusive questions by attendants. In June 2016, the Chief Rabbinate agreed to allow women to use a mikveh without an attendant.

=== Transgender people ===
Some transgender people have adopted the practice of mikveh immersion to mark a gender transition. However, many Orthodox authorities who control mikvot only permit immersions that adhere with Jewish law. Therefore, other Jewish organizations strive to create mikvot that allow for different uses, such as marking any important life transitions. Mayyim Hayyim, an organization in Newton, Massachusetts, collaborated with Keshet, one of Boston&#x27;s LGBT Jewish organizations, to actively create a mikveh space that felt accessible to transgender people, including training mikveh guides on gender issues.

There is some controversy within the Jewish transgender community about the use of mikvah to mark gender transitions. Some feel uncomfortable in a space that is traditionally so highly gendered and that requires complete nudity. Others still see mikveh as a place for married women to go after their periods, and therefore a transgender female would be exempt from these requirements as she does not menstruate.

<doc id="555750" wikidata="Q2638253" url="?curid=555750" title="Permeable paving">
<text>Permeable paving surfaces are made of either a porous material that enables stormwater to flow through it or nonporous blocks spaced so that water can flow between the gaps. Permeable paving can also include a variety of surfacing techniques for roads, parking lots, and pedestrian walkways. Permeable pavement surfaces may be composed of; pervious concrete, porous asphalt, paving stones, or interlocking pavers. Unlike traditional impervious paving materials such as concrete and asphalt, permeable paving systems allow stormwater to percolate and infiltrate through the pavement and into the aggregate layers and/or soil below. In addition to reducing surface runoff, permeable paving systems can trap suspended solids, thereby filtering pollutants from stormwater.

Permeable pavement is commonly used on roads, paths and parking lots subject to light vehicular traffic, such as cycle-paths, service or emergency access lanes, road and airport shoulders, and residential sidewalks and driveways.

== Description and applications ==

Permeable solutions can be based on porous asphalt and concrete surfaces, concrete pavers (permeable interlocking concrete paving systems – PICP), or polymer-based grass pavers, grids and geocells. Porous pavements such as pervious concrete and pervious asphalt are better suited for urbanized areas that see more frequent vehicular traffic, while concrete pavers, grids, and geocells are better suited for light vehicular traffic, pedestrian and cycling pathways, and overflow parking lots. Pervious concrete pavers allow water to percolate and infiltrate through the pavers and into the aggregate layers and/or soil below. Impervious concrete pavers installed with ample void space between each paver function in the same way as pervious concrete pavers as they enable stormwater to drain into the voids between each paver, either filled with coarse aggregate or vegetation, to a stone and/or soil base layer for on-site infiltration and filtering. Polymer based grass grid or cellular paver systems provide load bearing reinforcement for unpaved surfaces of gravel or turf.

Grass pavers, plastic turf reinforcing grids (PTRG), and geocells (cellular confinement systems) are honeycombed 3D grid-cellular systems, made of thin-walled HDPE plastic or other polymer alloys. These provide grass reinforcement, ground stabilization and gravel retention. The 3D structure reinforces infill and transfers vertical loads from the surface, distributing them over a wider area. Selection of the type of cellular grid depends to an extent on the surface material, traffic and loads. The cellular grids are installed on a prepared base layer of open-graded stone (higher void spacing) or engineered stone (stronger). The surface layer may be compacted gravel or topsoil seeded with grass and fertilizer. In addition to load support, the cellular grid reduces compaction of the soil to maintain permeability, while the roots improve permeability due to their root channels.

In new suburban growth, porous pavements protect watersheds by delaying and filtering the surge flow. In existing built-up areas and towns, redevelopment and reconstruction are opportunities to implement stormwater water management practices. Permeable paving is an important component in Low Impact Development (LID), a process for land development in the United States that attempts to minimize impacts on water quality and the similar concept of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) in the United Kingdom.

The infiltration capacity of the native soil is a key design consideration for determining the depth of base rock for stormwater storage or for whether an underdrain system is needed.

== Advantages ==

=== Managing runoff ===

Permeable paving surfaces have been demonstrated as effective in managing runoff from paved surfaces and recharging groundwater aquifers. Large volumes of urban runoff causes serious erosion and siltation in surface water bodies. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface, strong enough to take heavy loads, like large vehicles, while at the same time they allow water to filter through the surface and reach the underlying soils, mimicking natural ground absorption. They can reduce downstream flooding and stream bank erosion, and maintain base flows in rivers to keep ecosystems self-sustaining. Permeable pavers also combat erosion that occurs when grass is dry or dead, by replacing grassed areas in suburban and residential environments. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the subsurface layers.

=== Controlling pollutants ===
To control pollutants found in surface runoff, permeable paving surfaces capture the stormwater in the soil or aggregate base below the road or pathway, and subsequently treat the runoff via percolation, which allows water to infiltrate, supporting groundwater recharge or contain the stormwater to be released back into municipal stormwater management systems after a storm. Permeable paving systems have shown effective in reducing suspended solids, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand, and ammonium concentrations within groundwater. In areas where infiltration is not possible due to unsuitable soil conditions, permeable pavements are used in the attenuation mode where water is retained in the pavement and slowly released to surface water systems between storm events.

=== Trees ===
Permeable pavements may give urban trees the rooting space they need to grow to full size. A &quot;structural-soil&quot; pavement base combines structural aggregate with soil; a porous surface admits vital air and water to the rooting zone. This integrates healthy ecology and thriving cities, with the living tree canopy above, the city&#x27;s traffic on the ground, and living tree roots below. The benefits of permeables on urban tree growth have not been conclusively demonstrated and many researchers have observed tree growth is not increased if construction practices compact materials before permeable pavements are installed.

=== Reducing heat island effect ===
Research findings indicate that employing high albedo (reflective) and permeable pavement has the potential to alleviate near-surface heat island effects and enhance air quality, while also potentially improving human thermal comfort. In comparison to impermeable pavement, permeable pavement exhibits minimal thermal impact on the near-surface air due to its capacity for heat exchange.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Runoff volumes ===
Permeable pavements are designed to replace Effective Impervious Areas (EIAs), but can be used, in some cases, to manage stormwater from other impervious surfaces on site. Use of this technique must be part of an overall on site management system for stormwater, and is not a replacement for other techniques.

During large storm events, the water table below the porous pavement can rise to a higher level, preventing the precipitation from being absorbed into the ground. Some additional water is stored in the open graded or crushed drain rock base, and remains until the subgrade can absorb the water. For clay-based soils, or other low to &#x27;non&#x27;-draining soils, it is important to increase the depth of the crushed drain rock base to allow additional capacity for the water as it waits to be infiltrated.

=== Pollutant load ===
Runoff across some land uses may become contaminated, where pollutant concentrations exceed those typically found in stormwater. These &quot;hot spots&quot; include commercial plant nurseries, recycling facilities, fueling stations, industrial storage, marinas, some outdoor loading facilities, public works yards, hazardous materials generators (if containers are exposed to rainfall), vehicle service, washing, and maintenance areas, and steam cleaning facilities. Since porous pavement is an infiltration practice, it should not be applied at stormwater hot spots due to the potential for groundwater contamination. All contaminated runoff should be prevented from entering municipal storm drain systems by using best management practices (BMPs) for the specific industry or activity.

=== Weight and traffic volumes ===
Reference sources differ on whether low or medium traffic volumes and weights are appropriate for porous pavements due to the variety of physical properties of each system. For example, around truck loading docks and areas of high commercial traffic, porous pavement is sometimes cited as being inappropriate. However, given the variability of products available, the growing number of existing installations in North America and targeted research by both manufacturers and user agencies, the range of accepted applications seems to be expanding. Some concrete paver companies have developed products specifically for industrial applications. Working examples exist at fire halls, busy retail complex parking lots, and on public and private roads, including intersections in parts of North America with quite severe winter conditions.

=== Siting ===
Permeable pavements may not be appropriate when land surrounding or draining into the pavement exceeds a 20 percent slope, where pavement is down slope from buildings or where foundations have piped drainage at their footers. The key is to ensure that drainage from other parts of a site is intercepted and dealt with separately rather than being directed onto permeable surfaces.

=== Climate ===
Cold climates may present special challenges. Road salt contains chlorides that could migrate through the porous pavement into groundwater. Snow plow blades could catch block edges of concrete pavers or other block installations, damaging surfaces and creating potholes. Sand cannot be used for snow and ice control on porous surfaces because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability. Although there are design modifications to reduce the risks, infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing frost heave. Another issue is spalling damage, which exclusively occurs on porous concrete pavement from salt application during the winter season. Thus porous paving is suggested for warmer climates. However, other materials have proven to be effective, even lowering winter maintenance costs by preserving salt in the pavement itself. This also reduces the amount of storm water runoff that is contaminated with salt chlorides. Pervious concrete and asphalt designed to reduce frost heave and spalling damage has been used successfully in Norway and New Hampshire. Furthermore, experience suggests that preventive measures with rapid drainage below porous surfaces be taken in order to increase the rate of snow melt above ground.

=== Cost ===
It can be difficult to compare cost impacts between conventional impervious surfaces and permeable surfaces given the variables such as lifespan, geographic location, type of permeable paving system and site specific factors. Some estimates put the cost of permeable paving at about one third more expensive than that of conventional impervious paving. Using permeable paving, however, can reduce the cost of providing larger or more stormwater BMPs on site, and these savings should be factored into any cost analysis. In addition, the off-site environmental impact costs of not reducing on-site stormwater volumes and pollution have historically been ignored or assigned to other groups (local government parks, public works and environmental restoration budgets, fisheries losses, etc.). Permeable paving systems, specifically pervious concrete pavers, have shown significant cost benefits after a Life Cycle Assessment was performed, as the reduction in total weight of material needed for each unit is reduced by nature of the porous design.

=== Longevity and maintenance ===
Permeable paving systems, especially those with porous surfaces, require maintenance in order to keep the pores clear of fine aggregates as to not hinder the systems ability to infiltrate stormwater. The frequency of cleaning is again dependent on many site specific factors, such as runoff volume, neighboring sites and climate. Often, cleaning of permeable paving systems is done by suction excavators, which are alternatively used for excavation in sensitive areas and therefore are becoming increasingly common. If maintenance is not carried out on a regular basis, the porous pavements can begin to function more like impervious surfaces. With more advanced paving systems the levels of maintenance needed can be greatly decreased, elastomerically bound glass pavements requires less maintenance than regular concrete paving as the glass bound pavement has 50% more void space.

Plastic grid systems, if selected and installed correctly, are becoming more and more popular with local government maintenance personnel owing to the reduction in maintenance efforts: reduced gravel migration and weed suppression in public park settings.

Some permeable paving products are prone to damage from misuse, such as drivers who tear up patches of plastic &amp; gravel grid systems by &quot;joy riding&quot; on remote parking lots at night. The damage is not difficult to repair but can look unsightly in the meantime. Grass pavers require supplemental watering in the first year to establish the vegetation, otherwise they may need to be re-seeded. Regional climate also means that most grass applications will go dormant during the dry season. While brown vegetation is only a matter of aesthetics, it can influence public support for this type of permeable paving.

Traditional permeable concrete paving bricks tend to lose their color in relatively short time which can be costly to replace or clean and is mainly due to the problem of efflorescence.

== Types of permeable pavement ==
Installation of porous pavements is no more difficult than that of dense pavements, but has different specifications and procedures which must be strictly adhered to. Nine different families of porous paving materials present distinctive advantages and disadvantages for specific applications. Here are examples:

=== Pervious concrete ===
Pervious concrete is widely available, can bear frequent traffic, and is universally accessible. Pervious concrete quality depends on the installer&#x27;s knowledge and experience.

=== Plastic grids ===
Plastic grids allow for a 100% porous system using structural grid systems for containing and stabilizing either gravel or turf. These grids come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on use; from pathways to commercial parking lots. These systems have been used readily in Europe for over a decade, but are gaining popularity in North America due to requirements by government for many projects to meet LEED environmental building standards. Plastic grid systems are also popular with homeowners due to their lower cost to install, ease of installation, and versatility. The ideal design for this type of grid system is a closed cell system, which prevents gravel/sand/turf from migrating laterally.

=== Porous asphalt ===

Porous asphalt is produced and placed using the same methods as conventional asphalt concrete; it differs in that fine (small) aggregates are omitted from the asphalt mixture. The remaining large, single-sized aggregate particles leave open voids that give the material its porosity and permeability. To ensure pavement strength, fiber may be added to the mix or a polymer-modified asphalt binder may be used. Generally, porous asphalt pavements are designed with a subsurface reservoir that holds water that passes through the pavement, allowing it to evaporate and/or percolate slowly into the surround soils.

&quot;Open-graded friction courses&quot; (OGFC) are a porous asphalt surface course used on highways to improve driving safety by removing water from the surface. These use an open-graded mix design for the top layer of asphalt. Unlike a full-depth porous asphalt pavement, OGFCs do not drain water to the base of a pavement. Instead, they allow water to infiltrate the top 3/4 to 1.5 inch of the pavement and then drain out to the side of the roadway. This can improve the friction characteristics of the road and reduce road spray.

=== Single-sized aggregate ===
Single-sized aggregate without any binder, e.g. loose gravel, stone-chippings, is another alternative. Although it can only be safely used in walkways and very low-speed, low-traffic settings, e.g. car-parks and drives, its potential cumulative area is great.

=== Porous turf ===

Porous turf, if properly constructed, can be used for occasional parking like that at churches and stadia. Plastic turf reinforcing grids can be used to support the increased load. Living turf transpires water, actively counteracting the &quot;heat island&quot; with what appears to be a green open lawn.

=== Permeable interlocking concrete pavements ===

Permeable interlocking concrete pavements are concrete units with open, permeable spaces between the units. More recently manufacturers have introduced styles with smaller joint allowing for better ADA compliance and still capturing a significant amount of stormwater. They give an architectural appearance, and can bear both light and heavy traffic, particularly interlocking concrete pavers, excepting high-volume or high-speed roads. Some products are polymer-coated and have an entirely porous face.

=== Permeable clay brick pavements ===
Permeable clay brick pavements are fired clay brick units with open, permeable spaces between the units. Clay pavers provide a durable surface that allows stormwater runoff to permeate through the joints.

=== Resin-bound paving ===

Resin bound paving is a mixture of resin binder and aggregate. Clear resin is used to fully coat each aggregate particle before laying. Enough resin is used to allow each aggregate particle to adhere to one another and to the base yet leave voids for water to permeate through. Resin bound paving provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads.

=== Stabilized decomposed granite ===
Stabilized decomposed granite is a mixture of a non-resin binder and aggregate (decomposed granite). The binder, which may include color, is mixed with the decomposed granite and the mixture is moistened either before it is put in place or after. Stabilized decomposed granite provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads. The surface is ADA compliant and can be painted on..

=== Bound recycled glass porous pavement ===
Elastomerically bound recycled glass porous pavement consisting of bonding processed post-consumer glass with a mixture of resins, pigments, granite and binding agents. Approximately 75 percent of glass in the U.S. is disposed in landfills.

=== Wood permeable pavement ===
Wood permeable pavement is a natural and sustainable building material. Architects and landscape designers turning towards permeable pavers will find that some types of highly durable hardwoods (e.g. Black Locust) are an effective permeable pavers material. Wood paver blocks made of Black Locust provide a highly permeable, durable surface that will last for decades because of the characteristics of the wood. Black Locust Lumber wood pavers exceed 10.180 PSI (pounds per square inch) and have a Janka Hardness 1,700 lbf. They are suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the form of pathways and driveways and are placed upon permeable foundations.

<text>Iams () is an American brand of dog food and cat food manufactured by Spectrum Brands in Europe and Mars, Incorporated worldwide excluding Europe. The food is formulated for the puppy/kitten, adult and mature stages of life. Veterinary formulas for pets with special dietary requirements are also produced.

According to Iams, since 2006, studies have been conducted in pet owners&#x27; homes, P&amp;G Pet Care&#x27;s Pet Health &amp; Nutrition Center and locations where dogs and cats are already living such as assistance dog organizations.

== History ==
During the 1940s, because pet food was not available in stores, animals were predominantly fed homemade food, usually table scraps. Paul Iams, an animal nutritionist who graduated from the Ohio State University in 1937, founded the Iams Company in 1946 in a small feed mill near Dayton, Ohio. In 1950, he developed the world&#x27;s first animal-based protein dry dog food and called it Iams 999. In 1969, Paul Iams wanted to differentiate the new formula from other Iams products. Iams chose to name this new formula &quot;Eukanuba&quot;, a term originated by jazz era personality Hoagy Carmichael, meaning &quot;the tops&quot; or &quot;something supreme&quot;.[&quot; – &quot;]

In 1973 during the Arab oil embargo, the costs for meat and bone meal tripled. Sale prices in the U.S. were frozen by a nationwide wage and price control was issued by ex-president Richard Nixon. Iams did not change the product formula during the price-freeze mandate and the company nearly went bankrupt. Clay Mathile, who had joined Iams in 1970, purchased half of the company in 1975. By 1982, he became its sole owner and president. After expanding the company from $100,000 revenue in 1970 to $900 million in 1999, Mathile sold it to Procter &amp; Gamble in September 1999.

In its largest divestiture in five years, Procter &amp; Gamble announced in April 2014 that it would sell Iams worldwide, Eukanuba and Natura pet-food brands in all markets except Europe to for Mars, Inc. $2.9 billion in cash. Mars said that the deal would allow it to gain a new business and generate cash to grow core businesses. The deal for P&amp;G Pet Care&#x27;s operations in North America and Latin America was completed in August 2014. P&amp;G also exercised options to acquire Mars&#x27;s pet-food business in some parts of Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, including Australia, Japan and Singapore. Procter &amp; Gamble sold its European pet-care business to Spectrum Brands in December 2014.

<text>Memorial Stadium, also known as the &quot;Brick House&quot;, was an outdoor athletic stadium in the north central United States, located on the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. It was the home of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team for 58 seasons, from 1924 through 1981. Prior to 1924, the Gophers played at Northrop Field. 

Starting in 1982, the Gophers played their home games in the new Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and Memorial Stadium was demolished a decade later. After 27 seasons indoors, the Gophers returned to campus in 2009 at the new Huntington Bank Stadium, a block from the site of Memorial Stadium.

==History==
Opened on October 14, 1924, the stadium was dedicated to the 3,527 students, graduates, and workers who served in World War I, which had ended six years earlier. It sat on approximately . 

While Memorial Stadium was its home, the football team won six national championships, including three consecutive (1934–1936). The championship years were 1934, 1935, 1936, 1940, 1941, and 1960. The official capacity of the stadium during the 1970s was listed as 56,652. From the 1940s onward, temporary bleachers were occasionally brought in to boost capacity to approximately 66,000, though many of the seats were far away from the field. The stadium&#x27;s attendance record was 66,284, set in 1961 against Purdue on November 18.

Memorial Stadium also served as the university&#x27;s track and field venue, and was an occasional back-up venue for professional football and soccer. In 1969, the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings played a regular season game on October 5 against the Green Bay Packers at Memorial Stadium. It was due to a conflict with a Minnesota Twins playoff game at Metropolitan Stadium, game three of the 1969 American League Championship Series the following day. The Vikings also played a pre-season game at Memorial in 1971, its second season with artificial turf. The artificial Tartan Turf was removed after seven seasons and returned to natural grass in 1977.

The Minnesota Kicks soccer team of the NASL played once at Memorial Stadium, a 1981 playoff game on September 6 against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers and lost 3–0. The game was moved due to a schedule conflict with the Twins at Met Stadium. It was the last game in Kicks&#x27; history.

Ancel Keys founded the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene underneath Memorial Stadium, on the ground floor accessed at Gate 27. Here thirty-six conscientious objectors were confined during the yearlong Minnesota Starvation Experiment.

Memorial Stadium served as the anchor for Stadium Village, a small commercial area at the southeast portion of the Twin Cities campus.

==Move to Metrodome 1982==
Pressured by downtown Minneapolis business interests and athletic boosters, the school elected to move out of the stadium to the new Metrodome, about away, during the spring of 1982. Athletic director Paul Giel cited the advantages of recruiting by playing in a new NFL venue. Also, the attendance was expected to go up in the late fall with protection from harsh weather.

Memorial Stadium had been neglected by that time, and was badly in need of renovation. New head coach Lou Holtz gave an impassioned speech when the time came in 1984 to decide whether to remain at the Metrodome, and declared that &quot;Athletes want to play at the Dome.&quot;

==University Aquatic center==
Following the move, the University of Minnesota proposed a new natatorium that would extend into the field at the open end of the horseshoe and ensure that there could be no return to Memorial Stadium. After legal challenges to halt construction of the natatorium failed, the Aquatic Center opened in 1990 and the stadium was torn down two years later. The original brick entrance arch was preserved, and when the McNamara Alumni Center was built on the same site it was installed in the interior atrium over the entrance to a small museum.

==Aftermath==
The move to the Metrodome proved to be a dismal failure in the long run, as Gophers home games lost the charm of being on a college campus. The Gophers had the lowest priority in scheduling, behind the Twins and Vikings, and had to move games if the Twins were in the baseball playoffs. The university also gave up most concession and parking revenue, although their portion of the rent was the lowest of the three Metrodome tenants.

On May 20, 2006, the state legislature passed a bill providing funding for a new on-campus stadium. It opened in the fall of 2009 as TCF Bank Stadium. The original Memorial Stadium site could not be used, due to the construction of the aquatic and alumni centers. The new stadium is located about a block from where the old stadium once stood and was designed so that the alumni center on the old site is visible through the open end of the horseshoe.

<doc id="555766" wikidata="Q4862100" url="?curid=555766" title="Baron Alington">
<text>Baron Alington was a title that was created three times in British history. The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland on 28 July 1642 when William Alington was made Baron Alington, of Killard in the County of Cork. His second son, the third Baron (who succeeded in the title on the early death of his elder brother), was a Major-General in the English Army. On 5 December 1682 he was created Baron Alington, of Wymondley in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of England. The English barony became extinct on the death of his young son Giles, the fourth Baron, in 1691. The late Baron was succeeded in the Irish barony by his uncle, the fifth Baron. He was a captain in the army. On his death, in February 1723, the Irish barony became extinct as well.

The title was revived on 15 January 1876 when the peer and Conservative politician Henry Sturt was made Baron Alington, of Crichel in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was the son of Henry Sturt, great-grandson of Humphrey Sturt by his wife Diana (through which marriage Crichel House in Dorset came into the Sturt family), daughter of Sir Nathaniel Napier, 3rd Baronet, and Catherine, daughter of the third Baron of the 1642 creation. Lord Alington was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He represented Dorset East in Parliament. His eldest son, Captain Gerard Philip Montagu Napier Sturt (1893–1918), died on Armistice Day 1918, from wounds received in action, unmarried. Lord Alington was therefore succeeded by his second son, the third Baron. He was a Group Captain in the Royal Air Force. He had no sons and on his death on active service in 1940, the title became extinct. The family seat of Crichel House passed to the late Baron&#x27;s daughter, Mary Anna Sibell Elizabeth Sturt (1929–2010).

<doc id="555768" wikidata="Q626011" url="?curid=555768" title="Mean-field theory">
<text>In physics and probability theory, Mean-field theory (MFT) or Self-consistent field theory studies the behavior of high-dimensional random (stochastic) models by studying a simpler model that approximates the original by averaging over degrees of freedom (the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary). Such models consider many individual components that interact with each other.

The main idea of MFT is to replace all interactions to any one body with an average or effective interaction, sometimes called a &quot;molecular field&quot;. This reduces any many-body problem into an effective one-body problem. The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained at a lower computational cost.

MFT has since been applied to a wide range of fields outside of physics, including statistical inference, graphical models, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, epidemic models, queueing theory, computer-network performance and game theory, as in the quantal response equilibrium.

==Origins==
The idea first appeared in physics (statistical mechanics) in the work of Pierre Curie and Pierre Weiss to describe phase transitions. MFT has been used in the Bragg–Williams approximation, models on Bethe lattice, Landau theory, Curie-Weiss law for magnetic susceptibility, Flory–Huggins solution theory, and Scheutjens–Fleer theory.

Systems with many (sometimes infinite) degrees of freedom are generally hard to solve exactly or compute in closed, analytic form, except for some simple cases (e.g. certain Gaussian random-field theories, the 1D Ising model). Often combinatorial problems arise that make things like computing the partition function of a system difficult. MFT is an approximation method that often makes the original problem to be solvable and open to calculation, and in some cases MFT may give very accurate approximations.

In field theory, the Hamiltonian may be expanded in terms of the magnitude of fluctuations around the mean of the field. In this context, MFT can be viewed as the &quot;zeroth-order&quot; expansion of the Hamiltonian in fluctuations. Physically, this means that an MFT system has no fluctuations, but this coincides with the idea that one is replacing all interactions with a &quot;mean-field”.

Quite often, MFT provides a convenient launch point for studying higher-order fluctuations. For example, when computing the partition function, studying the combinatorics of the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian can sometimes at best produce perturbation results or Feynman diagrams that correct the mean-field approximation.

==Validity==
In general, dimensionality plays an active role in determining whether a mean-field approach will work for any particular problem. There is sometimes a critical dimension above which MFT is valid and below which it is not. 

Heuristically, many interactions are replaced in MFT by one effective interaction. So if the field or particle exhibits many random interactions in the original system, they tend to cancel each other out, so the mean effective interaction and MFT will be more accurate. This is true in cases of high dimensionality, when the Hamiltonian includes long-range forces, or when the particles are extended (e.g. polymers). The Ginzburg criterion is the formal expression of how fluctuations render MFT a poor approximation, often depending upon the number of spatial dimensions in the system of interest.

==Formal approach (Hamiltonian)==
The formal basis for mean-field theory is the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality states that the free energy of a system with Hamiltonian

: formula_1

has the following upper bound:

: formula_2

where formula_3 is the entropy, and formula_4 and formula_5 are Helmholtz free energies. The average is taken over the equilibrium ensemble of the reference system with Hamiltonian formula_6. In the special case that the reference Hamiltonian is that of a non-interacting system and can thus be written as

: formula_7

where formula_8 are the degrees of freedom of the individual components of our statistical system (atoms, spins and so forth), one can consider sharpening the upper bound by minimising the right side of the inequality. The minimising reference system is then the &quot;best&quot; approximation to the true system using non-correlated degrees of freedom and is known as the mean field approximation.

For the most common case that the target Hamiltonian contains only pairwise interactions, i.e.,

: formula_9

where formula_10 is the set of pairs that interact, the minimising procedure can be carried out formally. Define formula_11 as the generalized sum of the observable formula_12 over the degrees of freedom of the single component (sum for discrete variables, integrals for continuous ones). The approximating free energy is given by
:formula_13

where formula_14 is the probability to find the reference system in the state specified by the variables formula_15. This probability is given by the normalized Boltzmann factor
: formula_16

where formula_17 is the partition function. Thus
:formula_18

In order to minimise, we take the derivative with respect to the single-degree-of-freedom probabilities formula_19 using a Lagrange multiplier to ensure proper normalization. The end result is the set of self-consistency equations
: formula_20

where the mean field is given by
: formula_21

==Applications==
Mean field theory can be applied to a number of physical systems so as to study phenomena such as phase transitions.

===Ising model===

====Formal derivation====
The Bogoliubov inequality, shown above, can be used to find the dynamics of a mean field model of the two-dimensional Ising lattice. A magnetisation function can be calculated from the resultant approximate free energy. The first step is choosing a more tractable approximation of the true Hamiltonian. Using a non-interacting or effective field Hamiltonian, 

:formula_22,

the variational free energy is

:formula_23

By the Bogoliubov inequality, simplifying this quantity and calculating the magnetisation function that minimises the variational free energy yields the best approximation to the actual magnetisation. The minimiser is
:formula_24
which is the ensemble average of spin. This simplifies to
:formula_25

Equating the effective field felt by all spins to a mean spin value relates the variational approach to the suppression of fluctuations. The physical interpretation of the magnetisation function is then a field of mean values for individual spins.

====Non-interacting spins approximation====
Consider the Ising model on a formula_26-dimensional lattice. The Hamiltonian is given by
: formula_27
where the formula_28 indicates summation over the pair of nearest neighbors formula_29, and formula_30 are neighboring Ising spins.

Let us transform our spin variable by introducing the fluctuation from its mean value formula_31. We may rewrite the Hamiltonian as
: formula_32

where we define formula_33; this is the &quot;fluctuation&quot; of the spin. 

If we expand the right side, we obtain one term that is entirely dependent on the mean values of the spins and independent of the spin configurations. This is the trivial term, which does not affect the statistical properties of the system. The next term is the one involving the product of the mean value of the spin and the fluctuation value. Finally, the last term involves a product of two fluctuation values.

The mean field approximation consists of neglecting this second-order fluctuation term:
: formula_34

These fluctuations are enhanced at low dimensions, making MFT a better approximation for high dimensions.

Again, the summand can be re-expanded. In addition, we expect that the mean value of each spin is site-independent, since the Ising chain is translationally invariant. This yields

: formula_35

The summation over neighboring spins can be rewritten as formula_36, where formula_37 means &quot;nearest neighbor of formula_38&quot;, and the formula_39 prefactor avoids double counting, since each bond participates in two spins. Simplifying leads to the final expression

: formula_40

where formula_41 is the coordination number. At this point, the Ising Hamiltonian has been &quot;decoupled&quot; into a sum of one-body Hamiltonians with an &quot;effective mean field&quot; formula_42, which is the sum of the external field formula_43 and of the &quot;mean field&quot; induced by the neighboring spins. It is worth noting that this mean field directly depends on the number of nearest neighbors and thus on the dimension of the system (for instance, for a hypercubic lattice of dimension formula_26, formula_45).

Substituting this Hamiltonian into the partition function and solving the effective 1D problem, we obtain

: formula_46

where formula_47 is the number of lattice sites. This is a closed and exact expression for the partition function of the system. We may obtain the free energy of the system and calculate critical exponents. In particular, we can obtain the magnetization formula_48 as a function of formula_49.

We thus have two equations between formula_48 and formula_49, allowing us to determine formula_48 as a function of temperature. This leads to the following observation:
* For temperatures greater than a certain value formula_53, the only solution is formula_54. The system is paramagnetic.
* For formula_55, there are two non-zero solutions: formula_56. The system is ferromagnetic.

formula_53 is given by the following relation: formula_58.

This shows that MFT can account for the ferromagnetic phase transition.

===Application to other systems===
Similarly, MFT can be applied to other types of Hamiltonian as in the following cases:
* To study the metal–superconductor transition. In this case, the analog of the magnetization is the superconducting gap formula_59.
* The molecular field of a liquid crystal that emerges when the Laplacian of the director field is non-zero.
* To determine the optimal amino acid side chain packing given a fixed protein backbone in protein structure prediction (see Self-consistent mean field (biology)).
* To determine the elastic properties of a composite material.
Variationally minimisation like mean field theory can be also be used in statistical inference.

==Extension to time-dependent mean fields==
In mean field theory, the mean field appearing in the single-site problem is a time-independent scalar or vector quantity. However, this isn&#x27;t always the case: in a variant of mean field theory called dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), the mean field becomes a time-dependent quantity. For instance, DMFT can be applied to the Hubbard model to study the metal–Mott-insulator transition.

<text>Canada Life Place is a sports-entertainment centre, in London, Ontario, Canada – the largest such centre in Southwestern Ontario. Its previous names include John Labatt Centre and Budweiser Gardens.

Opened as the John Labatt Centre in 2002, it was named after John Labatt, founder of the Labatt brewery in London. The centre&#x27;s name was changed to Budweiser Gardens (after Labatt&#x27;s sister brand in AB InBev) in Fall 2012. Naming rights of the stadium were attained by Canada Life, and finalized in October 2024.

The centre was built to be the new downtown home of London&#x27;s Ontario Hockey League team, the London Knights, replacing the 40-year-old London Ice House in the south end of the city, near Highway 401. Since 2011, it is home to London&#x27;s Basketball Super League team, the London Lightning.

==Ownership and management==
The arena is leased from the City of London by the London Civic Centre Corporation, an example of a public-private partnership. The London Civic Centre Corporation is owned in turn by EllisDon and Global Spectrum, the Philadelphia-based subsidiary of Comcast the American cable company. Global Spectrum manages the arena, and operates more than 100 other arenas.

===Seating and ticketing===
Approximate capacities:
* 9,046 - Hockey
* 9,000 - End stage concert
* 3,200 - Theatre mode (smaller concert)
* 2,800 - Theatre mode (with proscenium)
* 10,200 - Centre stage concert

In addition to the standard end stage configuration for large concerts, the arena can be set up to accommodate touring Broadway shows or smaller concerts in its theatre mode. The theatre mode features a small, intimate atmosphere and a 30-line fly grid to suspend scenery or lighting and sound.

When the sports-entertainment centre was originally being planned, estimates for sports seating were as low as 6,500 and high as 12,000 before settling on the original 9,090. It was decided due to several smaller arenas in the 4,000 to 7,000 range struggling financially and the cost on construction nearly doubling to have 12,000 or more seats. The sports-entertainment centre features 38 luxury suites and 1,100 club seats.

The arena complies with the Ontarians with Disabilities Act and has 55% more public washrooms than required by the law.

==Cost and construction==
John Labatt Centre was built at a cost of approximately $42 million by the London, Ontario-based construction company EllisDon Corp., builders of Toronto&#x27;s Rogers Centre. The City of London contributed $32 million for arena construction and $10 million to purchase the land, while the London Civic Centre Corporation added $9.5 million to the arena&#x27;s construction.

The sports-entertainment centre was originally named the John Labatt Centre, after the Labatt Brewing Company which has a production plant in London, until 2012 when their 10-year naming rights expired. The Labatt Brewing Company had an exclusive first rights on a second deal and could change the name if they chose, which they did, to Budweiser Gardens to further promote the main brand of their sister corporation, Anheuser-Busch. The original deal was $5-million for 10 years and the deal signed in 2012 was $6.4 million for 10 years. Global Spectrum, which manages the sports-entertainment centre, was selected by the City of London to choose the naming rights and they used a subsidiary called Front Row Marketing. Proceeds from naming rights are put into the net revenue, though the exact divide of the amount going to the City of London and Global Spectrum is unknown.

==Sporting events==
Within a few years of opening, the London Knights had a championship season in 2004–05 and the centre was well positioned to take maximum advantage of the team&#x27;s popularity.

Budweiser Gardens hosted the 2005 Memorial Cup, the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s national major junior championship series, which the Knights also won after winning the OHL championship. The arena also hosted the 2014 Memorial Cup, in which the Edmonton Oil Kings were champions defeating the Guelph Storm by a score of 6–3.

The University of Western Ontario Mustangs hockey team used Budweiser Gardens as their home arena from 2005 until 2007. They have since moved back to Thompson Arena.

In addition to hockey, the arena is used as home play arena for the London Lightning professional basketball team.

Budweiser Gardens is host to national-level events, such as the 2005 Canadian Figure Skating Championships, the 2006 Scott Tournament of Hearts (curling), the 2007 World Synchronized Skating Championships, the 2011 and 2023 Tim Hortons Brier (curling), as well as a wide variety of family entertainment such as &quot;Disney on Ice&quot;, the Harlem Globetrotters, Monster Jam (extreme motorsports) and &quot;Stars on Ice&quot;. It also hosted an international jousting tournament two years in a row, and the World Figure Skating Championships in 2013. The arena also hosted on September 22, 2014, an NHL preseason game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Toronto won, 3–2, in a shootout.

==Other events==
The arena has also hosted many other well known artists and Broadway Shows. Budweiser Gardens was launched as a concert venue with Cher&#x27;s &quot;Living Proof: The Farewell Tour&quot; in 2002. The tour returned for an encore performance in 2005. Sum 41 recorded their live album Go Chuck Yourself from their tour of the same name here on April 11, 2005. In 2007, Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;3 Bats Live&quot; DVD from the &quot;Seize The Night&quot; tour was recorded here. Cirque du Soleil chose Budweiser Gardens to stage its first-ever arena show, a rebuilt production of Saltimbanco. Sting performed during his Symphonicities Tour on July 21, 2010, along with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 2010, Budweiser Gardens was awarded as the Canadian Venue of the Year at the Canadian Music and Broadcast Industry Awards.

The arena hosted the 2019 Juno Awards on March 17, 2019.

On March 30, 2024, Budweiser Gardens hosted All Elite Wrestling &amp; Ring of Honor for a live television taping of AEW Collision and taped episodes for AEW Rampage and Ring of Honor Wrestling

<doc id="555776" wikidata="Q3179389" url="?curid=555776" title="Murder Was the Case">
<text>Murder Was the Case is a 1994 short film and soundtrack album starring and performed by Snoop Doggy Dogg. The 18 minute film was directed by Dr. Dre and Fab Five Freddy and chronicles the fictional death of Snoop Dogg and his resurrection after making a deal with the Devil. The film&#x27;s title comes from Snoop&#x27;s song of the same name from his debut album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, which had been released a year earlier.

The single &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; by Tha Dogg Pound was included on the &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; soundtrack and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996. The album was re-released with a bonus DVD containing three music videos on July 11, 2006.

Tupac Shakur was paid $200,000 by Death Row Records owner Suge Knight to record a song for the album, but the track (&quot;Life&#x27;s So Hard&quot; featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg) was never used on the official soundtrack release; it was later released on the soundtrack for his posthumously released film, &quot;Gang Related&quot;.

==Critical reception==

*&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (12/29/94-1/12/95, p. 178) - &quot;...[It] isn&#x27;t the trailblazer that Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot; was last year. But it is rap very nearly as strong. Featuring West Coast stalwarts...and new discoveries..., Dre and Dat Nigga Daz present gangsta- and R&amp;B-infected fare that slams...&quot;
*&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (11/11/94, p. 76) - &quot;...confirms...Dr. Dre as the new king of pop. In addition to the ominous remix of Snoop&#x27;s title song, Dre reunites with Ice Cube...Dre&#x27;s G-funk sound may be the hardest in the land, but it&#x27;s also the most gut-wrenchingly soulful...&quot; - Rating: A
*&quot;Q&quot; magazine (1/95, p. 258) - 3 Stars - Good - &quot;...While most ears will be tuned to the bile&#x27;n&#x27;beats of &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot;...the best track here is from Snoop&#x27;s young protege, Nate Dogg...One of West Coast rap&#x27;s more imaginative albums.&quot;
*&quot;The Source&quot; (1/95, p. 85) - 4 Stars - Slammin&#x27; - &quot;...while Jodeci duets with Tha Dogg Pound and an all-star cast to try their hand at the G-Funk sound, Dre begins plotting his next move...heavy-metal bass meets chunky keyboards...&quot;
*&quot;NME&quot; (12/24/94, p. 23) - Ranked #8 in NME&#x27;s list of the 10 best compilation albums of 1994.
*&quot;NME&quot; (10/15/94, p. 53) - 7 - Very Good - &quot;...anyone expecting this to signal Dre&#x27;s decline is kidding themselves. &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot; shows the old dogg has plenty of new tricks...&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
In the United States, on the chart dated November 5, 1994, &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one, powered by first week sales 329,000 units. The album opened at the top spot of the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

<text>The versine or versed sine is a trigonometric function found in some of the earliest (Sanskrit &quot;Aryabhatia&quot;,
Section I) trigonometric tables. The versine of an angle is 1 minus its cosine.

There are several related functions, most notably the coversine and haversine. The latter, half a versine, is of particular importance in the haversine formula of navigation.

==Overview==

The versine or versed sine is a trigonometric function already appearing in some of the earliest trigonometric tables. It is symbolized in formulas using the abbreviations , , , or . In Latin, it is known as the &quot;sinus versus&quot; (flipped sine), &quot;versinus&quot;, &quot;versus&quot;, or &quot;sagitta&quot; (arrow).

Expressed in terms of common trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent, the versine is equal to
formula_1

There are several related functions corresponding to the versine:

* The versed cosine, or vercosine, abbreviated , , or .
* The coversed sine or coversine (in Latin, &quot;cosinus versus&quot; or &quot;coversinus&quot;), abbreviated , , , or 
* The coversed cosine or covercosine, abbreviated , , or 

In full analogy to the above-mentioned four functions another set of four &quot;half-value&quot; functions exists as well:

* The haversed sine or haversine (Latin &quot;semiversus&quot;), abbreviated , , , , , , , or , most famous from the haversine formula used historically in navigation
* The haversed cosine or havercosine, abbreviated , , or 
* The hacoversed sine, hacoversine, or cohaversine, abbreviated , , , or 
* The hacoversed cosine, hacovercosine, or cohavercosine, abbreviated , or 

==History and applications==

===Versine and coversine===
The ordinary &quot;sine&quot; function (see note on etymology) was sometimes historically called the &quot;sinus rectus&quot; (&quot;straight sine&quot;), to contrast it with the versed sine (&quot;sinus versus&quot;). The meaning of these terms is apparent if one looks at the functions in the original context for their definition, a unit circle:

For a vertical chord &quot;AB&quot; of the unit circle, the sine of the angle &quot;θ&quot; (representing half of the subtended angle &quot;Δ&quot;) is the distance &quot;AC&quot; (half of the chord). On the other hand, the versed sine of &quot;θ&quot; is the distance &quot;CD&quot; from the center of the chord to the center of the arc. Thus, the sum of cos(&quot;θ&quot;) (equal to the length of line &quot;OC&quot;) and versin(&quot;θ&quot;) (equal to the length of line &quot;CD&quot;) is the radius &quot;OD&quot; (with length 1). Illustrated this way, the sine is vertical (&quot;rectus&quot;, literally &quot;straight&quot;) while the versine is horizontal (&quot;versus&quot;, literally &quot;turned against, out-of-place&quot;); both are distances from &quot;C&quot; to the circle.

This figure also illustrates the reason why the versine was sometimes called the &quot;sagitta&quot;, Latin for arrow. If the arc &quot;ADB&quot; of the double-angle &quot;Δ&quot; = 2&quot;θ&quot; is viewed as a &quot;bow&quot; and the chord &quot;AB&quot; as its &quot;string&quot;, then the versine &quot;CD&quot; is clearly the &quot;arrow shaft&quot;.

In further keeping with the interpretation of the sine as &quot;vertical&quot; and the versed sine as &quot;horizontal&quot;, &quot;sagitta&quot; is also an obsolete synonym for the abscissa (the horizontal axis of a graph).

In 1821, Cauchy used the terms &quot;sinus versus&quot; (&quot;siv&quot;) for the versine and &quot;cosinus versus&quot; (&quot;cosiv&quot;) for the coversine.

Historically, the versed sine was considered one of the most important trigonometric functions.

As &quot;θ&quot; goes to zero, versin(&quot;θ&quot;) is the difference between two nearly equal quantities, so a user of a trigonometric table for the cosine alone would need a very high accuracy to obtain the versine in order to avoid catastrophic cancellation, making separate tables for the latter convenient. Even with a calculator or computer, round-off errors make it advisable to use the sin2 formula for small &quot;θ&quot;.

Another historical advantage of the versine is that it is always non-negative, so its logarithm is defined everywhere except for the single angle (&quot;θ&quot; = 0, 2, …) where it is zero—thus, one could use logarithmic tables for multiplications in formulas involving versines.

In fact, the earliest surviving table of sine (half-chord) values (as opposed to the chords tabulated by Ptolemy and other Greek authors), calculated from the Surya Siddhantha of India dated back to the 3rd century BC, was a table of values for the sine and versed sine (in 3.75° increments from 0 to 90°).

The versine appears as an intermediate step in the application of the half-angle formula sin2 = versin(&quot;θ&quot;), derived by Ptolemy, that was used to construct such tables.

===Haversine===
The haversine, in particular, was important in navigation because it appears in the haversine formula, which is used to reasonably accurately compute distances on an astronomic spheroid (see issues with the Earth&#x27;s radius vs. sphere) given angular positions (e.g., longitude and latitude). One could also use sin2 directly, but having a table of the haversine removed the need to compute squares and square roots.

An early utilization by José de Mendoza y Ríos of what later would be called haversines is documented in 1801.

The first known English equivalent to a table of haversines was published by James Andrew in 1805, under the name &quot;Squares of Natural Semi-Chords&quot;.

In 1835, the term &quot;haversine&quot; (notated naturally as &quot;hav.&quot; or base-10 logarithmically as &quot;log. haversine&quot; or &quot;log. havers.&quot;) was coined by James Inman in the third edition of his work &quot;Navigation and Nautical Astronomy: For the Use of British Seamen&quot; to simplify the calculation of distances between two points on the surface of the Earth using spherical trigonometry for applications in navigation. Inman also used the terms &quot;nat. versine&quot; and &quot;nat. vers.&quot; for versines.

Other high-regarded tables of haversines were those of Richard Farley in 1856 and John Caulfield Hannyngton in 1876.

The haversine continues to be used in navigation and has found new applications in recent decades, as in Bruce D. Stark&#x27;s method for clearing lunar distances utilizing Gaussian logarithms since 1995 or in a more compact method for sight reduction since 2014.

===Modern uses===
While the usage of the versine, coversine and haversine as well as their inverse functions can be traced back centuries, the names for the other five cofunctions appear to be of much younger origin.

One period (0 &lt; &quot;θ&quot; &lt; 2&quot;π&quot;) of a versine or, more commonly, a haversine (or havercosine) waveform is also commonly used in signal processing and control theory as the shape of a pulse or a window function (including Hann, Hann–Poisson and Tukey windows), because it smoothly (continuous in value and slope) &quot;turns on&quot; from zero to one (for haversine) and back to zero. In these applications, it is named Hann function or raised-cosine filter. Likewise, the havercosine is used in raised-cosine distributions in probability theory and statistics.

In the form of sin2(&quot;θ&quot;) the haversine of the double-angle &quot;Δ&quot; describes the relation between spreads and angles in rational trigonometry, a proposed reformulation of metrical planar and solid geometries by Norman John Wildberger since 2005.

Inverse functions like arcversine (arcversin, arcvers, avers, aver), arcvercosine (arcvercosin, arcvercos, avercos, avcs), arccoversine (arccoversin, arccovers, acovers, acvs), arccovercosine (arccovercosin, arccovercos, acovercos, acvc), archaversine (archaversin, archav, haversin−1, invhav, ahav, ahvs, ahv, hav−1), archavercosine (archavercosin, archavercos, ahvc), archacoversine (archacoversin, ahcv) or archacovercosine (archacovercosin, archacovercos, ahcc) exist as well:

===Other properties===
These functions can be extended into the complex plane.

==Approximations==


When the versine &quot;v&quot; is small in comparison to the radius &quot;r&quot;, it may be approximated from the half-chord length &quot;L&quot; (the distance &quot;AC&quot; shown above) by the formula
formula_6

Alternatively, if the versine is small and the versine, radius, and half-chord length are known, they may be used to estimate the arc length &quot;s&quot; (&quot;AD&quot; in the figure above) by the formula
formula_7
This formula was known to the Chinese mathematician Shen Kuo, and a more accurate formula also involving the sagitta was developed two centuries later by Guo Shoujing.

A more accurate approximation used in engineering is
formula_8

==Arbitrary curves and chords==
The term &quot;versine&quot; is also sometimes used to describe deviations from straightness in an arbitrary planar curve, of which the above circle is a special case. Given a chord between two points in a curve, the perpendicular distance &quot;v&quot; from the chord to the curve (usually at the chord midpoint) is called a &quot;versine&quot; measurement. For a straight line, the versine of any chord is zero, so this measurement characterizes the straightness of the curve. In the limit as the chord length &quot;L&quot; goes to zero, the ratio goes to the instantaneous curvature. This usage is especially common in rail transport, where it describes measurements of the straightness of the rail tracks and it is the basis of the Hallade method for rail surveying.

The term &quot;sagitta&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;sag&quot;) is used similarly in optics, for describing the surfaces of lenses and mirrors.

<doc id="555784" wikidata="Q3439729" url="?curid=555784" title="Earl of Anglesey">
<text>Earl of Anglesey was a title in the Peerage of England during the 17th and 18th centuries.

==History==
The first creation came in 1623 when Christopher Villiers was created Earl of Anglesey, in Wales, as well as Baron Villiers. He was the elder brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham and the younger brother of John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck. However, the Earldom and Barony became extinct on the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1661, who in 1644 had married Mary Bayning, the young widow of his cousin William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, becoming the step-father of her only child, Barbara Villiers.
The second creation came in 1661 when Arthur Annesley, 2nd Viscount Valentia, was created Earl of Anglesey, in Wales, and Baron Annesley, of Newport Pagnel in the County of Buckinghamshire. The titles were deemed extinct in 1761.
The wife of the Earl was normally given the title of Countess.
==Earls of Anglesey==
===First creation (1623)===
*Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey (d. 1630)
*Charles Villiers, 2nd Earl of Anglesey (d. 1661)

===Second creation (1661)===
*Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey (1614–1686)
*James Annesley, 2nd Earl of Anglesey (1645–1690)
*James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey (1670–1702)
*John Annesley, 4th Earl of Anglesey (died 1710)
*Arthur Annesley, 5th Earl of Anglesey (1678–1737)
*Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey (1690–1761)

All but the last of these, and various other family members, are believed to be buried in the crypt of St Peter&#x27;s Old Parish Church, Farnborough, Hampshire.

<text>Baron Altham, of Altham in the County of Cork, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1681 for the Honourable Altham Annesley, younger son of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey and Elizabeth Altham, daughter and co-heiress of Sir James Altham (see Viscount Valentia for earlier history of the Annesley family). The title was created with remainder to heirs male and in default thereof to his younger brothers and their male issue. In 1689 he was attainted by the Irish Parliament of James II and his estates were sequestered. However, after the deposition of James II he was restored and allowed to take his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1695. He was succeeded by his son James, the second Baron, who died as an infant shortly after his father. The late Baron was succeeded according to the special remainder by his uncle Richard Annesley, the third Baron. He was a clergyman and served as Dean of Exeter. He was succeeded by his son, Arthur, the fourth Baron, whose son and rightful heir James Annesley was overlooked for the succession by his uncle, Richard Anglesey, the fifth Baron Altham and later sixth Earl of Anglesey. For further history of the legal battle that followed and the descent of the title, see Viscount Valentia.

<doc id="555791" wikidata="Q157286" url="?curid=555791" title="Nicobar Islands">
<text>The Nicobar Islands are an archipelagic island chain in the eastern Indian Ocean. They are located in Southeast Asia, northwest of Aceh on Sumatra, and separated from Thailand to the east by the Andaman Sea. Located southeast of the Indian subcontinent, across the Bay of Bengal, they are part of India, as the Nicobar district within the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Together with the Andaman Islands to their north, the Nicobar Islands serve as a maritime boundary between the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Andaman Sea to the east.

UNESCO has declared the Great Nicobar Island as one of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

==Geography==
The Nicobar Islands cover a land area of and had a population of 36,844 during the 2011 Census. They comprise three distinct groups:

Northern Group:
* Car Nicobar
* Battimalv

Central Group:
* Chowra, Chaura or Sanenyo
* Teressa or Luroo
* Bompuka or Poahat
* Katchal
* Camorta
* Trinket
* Nancowry or Nancowrie
* Tillangchong
* Laouk or &quot;Isle of Man&quot;

Southern Group (Sambelong):
* Great Nicobar (, largest island of the Nicobars)
* Kondul Island, located between Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar
* Kabra Island, located between Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar
* Little Nicobar
* Pulo Milo or Pillomilo (Milo Island)
* Menchal Island
* Treis (Albatei) Island
* Trak (Mafuya) Island
* Meroe
* Pigeon Island
* Megapod Island

Indira Point () is the southernmost point of Great Nicobar Island and also of India itself, lying about north of Sumatra, Indonesia.

===Geology===
The Nicobar Islands are part of a great island arc created by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Eurasia. The collision lifted the Himalayas and most of the Indonesian islands, and created a long arc of highlands and islands, which includes the Arakan Yoma range of Burma, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and the islands off the west coast of Sumatra, including the Banyak Islands and the Mentawai Islands.

===Climate===
The climate is warm and tropical, with temperatures ranging from . Rainfall is heavy due to annual monsoons and measures around each year.

===Ecology===
The Nicobar Islands are recognised as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, the Nicobar Islands rain forests, with many endemic species.

The vegetation of the Nicobars is typically divided into the coastal mangrove forests and the interior evergreen and deciduous tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. Additionally, several islands contain extensive inland grasslands, though these are thought to have resulted from human intervention.

As a result of lower sea levels during the ice ages, the Andaman Islands were linked to the Southeast Asian mainland, but it is not believed that the Nicobar Islands ever had a land bridge to the continent. Lower sea levels did link the islands to one another: Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar were linked to each other, and Nancowry, Chaura, Katchall, Trinka, Camorta, and the nearby smaller islands were linked to one another as well.

====Protected areas====
Protected areas include Campbell Bay National Park and Galathea National Park on Great Nicobar.

A World Biosphere Reserve was declared on Grand Nicobar by UNESCO on May 31, 2013. Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve has a total area of . The core area of comprises Cambell Bay and Galathea National Parks. A buffer area of includes lands adjacent to and between the two parks. There is also a transitional area of , including .

==Population==
The islands had a population of 36,842 in 2011. The indigenous ethnic groups are the Nicobarese and the Shompen. Local languages include Shompen and the languages of the tin Nicobarese group.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===

The Nicobar Islands are believed to have been inhabited for thousands of years. Six indigenous Nicobarese languages are spoken on the islands, which are part of the Austroasiatic language family, which includes the Mon, Khmer, and Vietnamese languages of Southeast Asia, and the Munda languages of India. An indigenous tribe living at the southern tip of Great Nicobar called the Shompen, may be of Mesolithic Southeast Asian origin.

=== Origin of the name ===
The earliest extant references to the name &quot;Nicobar&quot; is in the Sri Lankan Pali Buddhist chronicles, the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; (c. 3rd or 4th century CE) and the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; (c. 4th or 5th century), which state that the children of the followers of the legendary founder of the Sri Lankan Kingdom, Vijaya, landed on &quot;Naggadipa&quot; (the island of the children, from the Pali nagga meaning &#x27;naked&#x27;). In the ninth century, the Persian explorer Abū Zayd al-Sīrāfī referred to the Nicobar Islands as Lanjabālūs. 
The modern name is likely derived from the Chola dynasty name for the islands, Nakkavaram (may be referring to open/naked land or naked man&#x27;s land in Tamil) which is inscribed on the Thanjavur (Tanjore) inscription of 1050 CE. Marco Polo (12th-13th century) also referred to this island as &#x27;Necuverann&#x27;.

In the 15th century, Great Nicobar Island was recorded as &quot;Cui Lan island&quot; (翠蘭嶼) during the voyages of Zheng He in the Mao Kun map of the Wu Bei Zhi.

=== Colonial period ===
Organised European colonisation on the islands began with the Danish East India Company in 1754/56. During this time they were administered from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India) under the name of Frederiksøerne. Missionaries from the Moravian Church Brethren&#x27;s settlement in Tranquebar attempted a settlement on Nancowry and died in great numbers from disease. The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria: 1784–1807/09, 1830–1834, and finally from 1848 gradually for good. Between 1778 and 1783, William Bolts attempted to establish an Austrian colony on the islands on the mistaken assumption that Denmark–Norway had abandoned its claims to the islands.

Italy attempted to buy the Nicobar Islands from Denmark between 1864 and 1865. The Italian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Luigi Torelli started a negotiation that looked promising but failed due to the unexpected end of his office and the second La Marmora Cabinet. The negotiations were interrupted and never brought up again.
Denmark&#x27;s presence in the islands ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to the UK, which, in 1869, made them part of British India.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, the islands were invaded and occupied by Japan between 1942 and 1945. In May 1945, shelled Japanese positions on the islands. The British regained possession of the islands after the Surrender of Japan announced on 15 August and formally signed on 2 September 1945. After the war, Choudhry Rahmat Ali proposed that the Nicobars (which he called the &quot;Balus Islands&quot;) would have a sizeable Muslim population and thus would be integrated to the Dominion of Pakistan. This hasn&#x27;t materialized either.

===Indian union territory===
Together with the Andaman Islands, it became part of India in 1950 and was declared as a union territory of the nation in 1956.

===26 December 2004 tsunami===
On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Nicobar Islands was devastated by a tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. At least 6,000 people were killed on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with reports putting the death toll on Katchal Island alone at 4,600.

Several islands were heavily damaged with initial reports of islands broken in two or three pieces and coral reefs moved above water. Teressa Island was said to have been split into two pieces and Trinkat Island into three pieces. Some estimates said that the islands were moved as much as by the earthquake and tilted.

Indira Point subsided and the lighthouse there was damaged.

==Transportation==
* Airport: Car Nicobar has an airstrip on Car Nicobar Air Force Base of on the South East coast near Malacca but does not offer commercial service. Great Nicobar has a small airstrip of approximately at Campbell Bay/Tenlaa on its East Coast.
* Seaport: At least one small shipping dock is located in Campbell Bay on the East coast of Great Nicobar. Car Nicobar has a small dock at its Northern tip near Keating Point and Mus.

<text>The Pan-Pacific Auditorium was a landmark structure in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, California. It once stood near the site of Gilmore Field, an early Los Angeles baseball venue predating Dodger Stadium. It was located within sight of both CBS Television City on the southeast corner of Beverly and Fairfax Avenue and the Farmers Market on the northeast corner of Third Street and Fairfax. For over 35 years it was the premier location for indoor public events in Los Angeles. The facility was closed in 1972, beginning 17 years of steady neglect and decay. In 1978, the Pan-Pacific Auditorium was included in the National Register of Historic Places, but eleven years later the sprawling wooden structure was destroyed in a fire.

==Architectural icon==
Built by event promoters Phillip and Cliff Henderson and designed by Los Angeles architects Wurdeman &amp; Becket, the Pan-Pacific Auditorium opened to a fanfare of Boy Scout bugles on May 18, 1935 for a 16-day model home exhibition. Noted as one of the finest examples of Streamline Moderne architecture in the United States, the green and white facade faced west, was long and had four stylized towers and flagpoles meant to evoke upswept aircraft fins. The widely known and much photographed facade belied a modest rectilinear wooden structure resembling an overgrown gymnasium inside and out. The auditorium sprawled across and had seating for up to 6,000.
Throughout the following 30 years the Pan-Pacific would host the Ice Capades and the Harlem Globetrotters, serve as home to the Los Angeles Monarchs of the Pacific Coast Hockey League along with UCLA ice hockey, UCLA men&#x27;s basketball, USC men&#x27;s basketball, professional tennis, car shows, political rallies and circuses. During the 1940s it was used for audience-attended national radio broadcasts and in the 1950s for televised professional wrestling shows. At its height, most major indoor events in Los Angeles were held at the Pan-Pacific. Leopold Stokowski conducted there in 1936, 1950s actress Jeanne Crain was crowned &quot;Miss Pan Pacific&quot; there in the early 1940s, General Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke to a beyond-capacity crowd of 10,000 in 1952 a month before being elected President of the United States, Elvis Presley performed there in 1957 shortly before he was drafted into the Army and Vice President Richard Nixon addressed a national audience from the Pan-Pacific in November 1960. The building carried on as Los Angeles&#x27; primary indoor venue until the 1972 opening of the much larger Los Angeles Convention Center, after which the Pan-Pacific Auditorium was closed.


==Decay and fire==

There were hopes throughout the surrounding Fairfax District towards refurbishing the Pan-Pacific, possibly as an ice rink or cultural center and the parking lot soon became a park. However, the building was neglected for many years and damaged by small fires started by transients.

In 1975, the Pan-Pacific made a brief appearance as the entrance to the NBC Studios in Hollywood for the movie &quot;Funny Lady&quot;. Interest in the building was rekindled somewhat with its 1978 inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The 1980 release of the movie musical &quot;Xanadu&quot; brought renewed hopes the building might be saved when the auditorium&#x27;s facade was used to portray a dilapidated building which became a sparkling, brightly lit roller disco nightclub, but the movie was critically panned and not an economic success. It also appears at the beginning of the 1980 music video for the Barnes &amp; Barnes song &quot;Fish Heads&quot;. Black-and-white film footage of a man with a jet pack flying from left to right in front of the facade was used in the video for the 1981 Devo single, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;. The dilapidated façade was used in the video for &quot;Dancing in the Sheets&quot; by Shalamar. Its final appearance was in the 1988 movie &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;.

The auditorium continued to deteriorate throughout the 1980s, mostly owing to neglect. A large loading door on the southeast corner was often forced open, allowing free access to anyone. A fire in May 1983 damaged the northern end. On the evening of May 24, 1989 (six days after the 54th anniversary of its opening), the Pan-Pacific Auditorium was destroyed by a bigger fire, the smoke from which was visible throughout the Los Angeles basin.

==Site today==
The site is now part of Pan-Pacific Park. An urban park with a recreation center, designed as a scaled-down replica of one of the famous towers, opened in 2002.

==Pop culture==

The facade of the building was used in the motion picture &quot;Xanadu&quot;, in which a muse (a daughter of Zeus) convinces two men to convert the classic but decaying building into a music and entertainment venue. Through special effects, the building is transformed to outshine the building in its heyday.

The video for &quot;She&#x27;s My Girl&quot; by The Babys featured the band playing in front of, as well as on top of the building and its iconic flagpole facades.

Similarly, The Producers&#x27; 1982 music video &quot;She Sheila&quot; was partly filmed in front of the facade.

The 1984 motion picture &quot;Ghost Warrior&quot;, in which a deep-frozen 400-year-old samurai is shipped to Los Angeles, where he comes back to life, includes scenes of both the seriously decayed façade and the dimly lit interior. In the interior shots, the columns with angled knee bracing and the distinctive arched bowstring trusses are briefly visible.

The music video for the 1988 song &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot; by LL Cool J has a black and white photograph of the building in the opening sequence.

A nearly full-scale, stylized replica of the façade opened as the main entrance to Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida on May 1, 1989, just three weeks before the original was destroyed by fire.

Disney California Adventure Park, at the Disneyland Resort, opened new entrance gates in the style of the Pan-Pacific&#x27;s façade on July 15, 2011.

<text>The Flathead Tunnel is a railroad tunnel in the Rocky Mountains of northwest Montana near Trego, approximately west of Whitefish. Located on the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Kootenai River Subdivision, it is the second-longest railroad tunnel in the United States after the Cascade Tunnel. It is ultimately named after the Bitterroot Salish, also known as the Flathead.

The tunnel was constructed for the Great Northern Railway by the Walsh Construction Company and S.J. Groves and Sons (collectively known as Walsh–Groves) at a cost of nearly $44 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It is part of a rerouting of the Great Northern Hi-Line that became a necessity due to construction of Libby Dam and subsequent creation of Lake Koocanusa.

Work began on May 12, 1966. Drilling was completed on June 21, 1968 when President Lyndon B. Johnson ceremoniously triggered a final explosion from a circuit connected via telephone to the White House.

Finishing work continued for the following two years, and the tunnel, along with the entire rerouted rail line it is a part of, opened on November 1, 1970. An opening ceremony was held on November 7, 1970 and included the passage of the first &quot;official&quot; train through the tunnel, a 21-car passenger special carrying 1,200 area residents who were offered the opportunity to travel a circular route from Libby and back on both the new and old rail lines.

Official records indicate that two people were killed in two separate incidents during construction, both occurring after drilling was complete.

 the tunnel is used by about 40 freight trains each day as well as Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot;. Maximum speed through the tunnel is . The north portal contains a ventilation system to clear the tunnel of diesel locomotive exhaust and provide cooling air to eastbound locomotives, as there is an uphill grade heading eastbound.

<doc id="555816" wikidata="Q429036" url="?curid=555816" title="Claustrum">
<text>The claustrum (Latin, meaning &quot;to close&quot; or &quot;to shut&quot;) is a thin sheet of neurons and supporting glial cells in the brain, that connects to the cerebral cortex and subcortical regions including the amygdala, hippocampus and thalamus. It is located between the insular cortex laterally and the putamen medially, encased by the extreme and external capsules respectively. Blood to the claustrum is supplied by the middle cerebral artery. It is considered to be the most densely connected structure in the brain, and thus hypothesized to allow for the integration of various cortical inputs such as vision, sound and touch, into one experience. Other hypotheses suggest that the claustrum plays a role in salience processing, to direct attention towards the most behaviorally relevant stimuli amongst the background noise. The claustrum is difficult to study given the limited number of individuals with claustral lesions and the poor resolution of neuroimaging.

The claustrum is made up of various cell types differing in size, shape and neurochemical composition. Five cell types exist, and a majority of these cells resemble pyramidal neurons found in the cortex. Within the claustrum, there is no laminar organization of cell types as in the cortical layers, and the cell bodies can be a pyramidal, fusiform or circular. The principal cell type found in the claustrum is the Golgi type I neuron, which is a large cell with dendrites covered in spines.
Through interhemispheric connections, the claustrum is believed to play a role in synchronizing activity in widely separated, but functionally related, parts of the brain such as between frontal eye fields and the visual cortex. As such, the claustrum is thought to play a role in combining different information modalities, potentially to support consciousness itself. Another proposed function of the claustrum is to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information so that the latter can be ignored.

Cortical components of consciousness include the fronto-parietal cortex, cingulate and precuneus. Due to the claustrum&#x27;s widespread connectivity to these areas, it is suggested that it may play a role in both attention and consciousness. The neural networks that mediate sustained attention and consciousness send inputs to the claustrum, and one case report in humans suggests that electrical stimulation near the claustrum reversibly disrupted the patient&#x27;s conscious state.

== Structure ==
The claustrum is a small bilateral gray matter structure (comprising roughly 0.25% of the cerebral cortex) located deep to the insular cortex and extreme capsule, and superficial to the external capsule and basal ganglia.

Its name means “hidden away”, and was first identified in 1672, with more detailed descriptions coming later on during the 19th century. Although the regional neuroanatomical boundaries of the claustrum have been defined, there remains a lack of consensus in the literature when defining its precise margins, though a meeting in 2019 of experts has posited a framework by which to refer to the structures across species.

=== Connections ===
An early summary of reports from the 20th century emphasized cortical inputs and outputs. However, later work has suggested the claustrum has extensive connections to cortical and subcortical regions. More specifically, electrophysiological studies show extensive connections to thalamic nuclei and the basal ganglia, while isotopological reports have linked the claustrum with the prefrontal, frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices. Additional studies have also looked at the relationship of the claustrum to well-described subcortical white matter tracts. Structures such as the corona radiata, occipitofrontal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus project to the claustrum from frontal, pericentral, parietal and occipital regions. Reciprocal connections also exist with motor, somatosensory, auditory and visual cortical regions. Altogether, these findings leave the claustrum as the most highly connected structure per regional volume in the brain and suggest that it may serve as a hub to coordinate activity of cerebral circuits. Even with this extensive connectivity, most projections to and from the claustrum are ipsilateral (although there are still contralateral projections), and little evidence exists to describe its afferent or efferent connections with the brainstem and spinal cord. In summary, the cortical and subcortical connectivity of the claustrum implies that it is most involved with processing sensory information, as well as the physical and emotional state of an animal.

=== Microanatomy ===
Inputs to the claustrum are organized by modality, which include prefrontal, visual, auditory and somatomotor processing areas. In the same way that the morphology of neurons in the Rexed laminae of the spinal cord is indicative of function, the visual, auditory and somatomotor regions within the claustrum share similar neurons with specific functional characteristics. For example, the portion of the claustrum that processes visual information (&quot;primarily synthesizing afferent fibers concerned with our peripheral visual field&quot;) is comprised by a majority of binocular cells that have &quot;elongated receptive fields and no orientation selectivity&quot;.

This focus on the peripheral sensory system is not an isolated occurrence, as most sensory afferents entering the claustrum bring peripheral sensory information. Moreover, the claustrum possesses a distinct topological organization for each sensory modality as well as the dense connectivity it shares with frontal cortices. For example, there is a retinotopic organization within the visual processing area of the claustrum that mirrors that of visual association cortices and V1, in a similar (yet less complicated) manner to the retinotopic conservation within the lateral geniculate nucleus.

Within the claustrum, local connectivity is dominated by feed-forward disynaptic inhibition wherein parvalbumin-expressing interneurons suppress the activity of nearby projection neurons. Local interneurons themselves are connected through both chemical and electrical synapses, allowing for widespread and synchronous inhibition of local claustrum circuitry. In recent studies of the claustrum in mice and bats, cortically-projecting excitatory claustrum neurons were found to form synapses across the anteroposterior axis and were biased toward neurons that do not share projection targets, with the possible function of joining the activity of different afferent modules. Combined, these two circuits suggest that the claustrum is capable of performing local transformations of diverse input information from across the brain.

=== Cell types ===
The claustrum is made up of various cell types that differ in size, shape and neurochemical composition. Excitatory cell types in the claustrum consist of two main classes which differentially project to cortical and subcortical brain regions. Inhibitory neurons represent only 10%-15% of the neurons within the claustrum and consist of three types, expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin or vasoactive intestinal peptide, similar to inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Finally, many studies show that the claustrum is best distinguished structurally by its prominent plexus of parvalbumin-positive fibers formed by parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory cell types. In recent studies, the use of myelin basic protein (MBP) and retrogradely traveling cholera toxin have additionally been used as effective methods of identifying the claustrum.

Several approaches in mice have been used to assess claustrum cell types, including electrophysiological, morphological, genetic, and connectomic approaches. While no clear consensus has yet been reached regarding the exact number of excitatory cell types, recent studies have suggested that cortically- and subcortically-projecting claustrum neurons are likely distinct and vary along several metrics, such as their intrinsic electrophysiological profiles, afferent projections, and neuromodulatory profiles.

== Function ==
The claustrum has been shown to have widespread activity to numerous cortical components, all of which have been associated with having components of consciousness and sustained attention. This is because of widespread connectivity to fronto-parietal areas, cingulate cortex, and thalami. Sustained attention is from the connections to the cingulate cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus.

Crick and Koch suggest that the claustrum has a role similar to that of a conductor within an orchestra as it attempts to co-ordinate the function of all connections. This “conductor” analogy can also be supported through connections between the claustral, sensory, and frontal regions. The claustrum has been confirmed to be reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex, visual, auditory, sensory, and motor regions respectively. Connections to these modalities provide insight into the functionality of the claustrum. Here it is proposed that the claustrum functions in the gating of selective attention. Through this gating process the claustrum can selectively control input from these modalities to facilitate the process of “focusing”. It has also been suggested that it operates in the opposite context; that through divisive normalization the claustrum may implement resistance to certain input modalities to prevent “distraction”.

=== Potential function ===
The claustrum, in order to facilitate consciousness, would need to integrate various sensory and motor modalities from various parts of the cortex. The anatomical connections of the claustrum have been observed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan looks at oxygenated blood levels in the brain as a way of observing the activity of specific cortical areas. fMRI scans show dampened activity when anesthetized versus awake in rats, specifically claustrum connections to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD thalamus). The claustrum is connected with the contralateral hemisphere&#x27;s claustrum with strong, functional connections. Connections with MD thalamus, mPFC, and surrounding and distant cortical areas also exist.

Electrical stimulation in the dorsal claustrum of cats elicits excitatory responses within the visual cortex. The claustrum is situated anatomically at the confluence of a large number of white-matter tracts used to connect different parts of the cortex. This further suggests an integration center role for these different modalities, such as sensory and motor. Gap junctions have been shown to exist between aspiny (lacking dendrite projections) interneurons of the claustrum – suggesting a role in its ability to synchronize these modalities as input is received.

Additional studies point to involvement in spatial navigation and slow-wave sleep.

===Attention===
The claustrum has the differential ability to select between task-relevant information and task-irrelevant information to provide directed attention. It contains the highest density of connecting white matter tracts in the cortex. This supports the notion of networking and coordination among different regions of the brain. The claustrum has regional specificity to it; information coming in from visual centers project to specific areas of grey matter neurons in the structure and the auditory cortex. Unexpected stimuli also activate the claustrum, effecting an immediate focusing or allocation of function. In lower mammals (e.g. rats), claustral regions receive input from somatosensory modalities, such as whiskers&#x27; motor control perspective because of its sensory and discriminatory use in these mammals.

Functionally, it is proposed that it segregates attention between these modalities. Attention itself has been considered as top-down processing or bottom-up processing; both fit contextually with what is observed in the claustrum structurally and functionally, supporting the notion that interactions occur with high-order sensory areas involved in encoding objects and features. Input from the prefrontal cortex, for example, will define attention based upon higher-cognitive task-driven behaviour. Moreover, induction of electrical stimulation to the claustrum has been shown to cause inhibition of reading, a blank stare, and unresponsiveness. It has been reported that the claustrum has a basal frequency firing that is modulated to increase or decrease with directed attention. For example, projections to motor and oculomotor areas would assist with gaze movement to direct attention to new stimuli by increasing the firing frequency of claustral neurons.

Salvinorin A, the active hallucinogenic compound found in &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, is capable of inducing loss of awareness. Consumption of salvinorin A can induce synesthesia, in which different sensory modalities are interpreted by different sensory cortices. (For example: seeing sounds, tasting colours.) This supports the idea of intrathalamic segregation and conduction (attention). The claustrum has kappa opioid receptors to which Salvinorin A binds, eliciting this effect.

=== Empirical evidence ===
High frequency stimulation (HFS) in cat claustrum(s) has the capability to induce autonomic changes and induce “inactivation syndrome”. This syndrome is described as a decrease in awareness, indicating the relationship between the claustrum and consciousness. In humans this same effect can be observed. Stimulation of the left claustrum in humans has produced &quot;a complete arrest of volitional behavior, unresponsiveness, and amnesia without negative motor symptoms, or mere aphasia&quot; suggesting the involvement in consciousness. Furthermore, MRI studies have shown that increased signal intensity within the claustrum has been associated with status epilepticus – a condition in which epileptic seizures follow one another without recovery of consciousness between events. As well, increased signal intensity is associated with focal dyscognitive seizures, which are seizures that elicit impairment of awareness or consciousness without convulsions. The individual becomes unaware of his or her environment, and the seizure will manifest as a blank or empty stare for a window of time.

Using an operant conditioning task combined with HFS of the claustrum resulted in significant behavioural changes of rats; this included modulated motor responses, inactivity and decreased responsiveness. Beyond this, studies have also shown that the claustrum is active during REM sleep, alongside other structures such as the dentate gyrus. These have associative roles in spatial memory, suggesting that some form of memory consolidation takes place in these areas.

=== Lesions and consciousness ===
Functionally, the claustrum will integrate various cortical inputs through its connections into consciousness. Based upon its structure and connectivity, its function is suggested to be related to coordination of different brain functions; i.e. the conductor analogy. Consciousness functionally can be divided into two components: (i) wakefulness, which is arousal and alertness; (ii) content of consciousness, which is the processing of content.

A study of traumatic brain injuries in war veterans was undertaken to better understand the functional role of the claustrum. Damage to the claustrum was associated with the duration of one&#x27;s loss of consciousness, but not its frequency. Lesion size was correlated with a longer duration of LOC events. No consequences were shown to attenuate cognitive processing.

In a single-case study, consciousness was shown to be disrupted when there was stimulation to the extreme capsule of the brain – which is in close proximity to the claustrum – such that upon termination of stimulation, consciousness was regained. Another study looking at the symptomology of schizophrenia established that the severity of delusions was associated with decreased grey matter volume of the left claustrum; postulating that correlations exist between the structure and positive symptoms seen in this psychiatric disorder. Further supporting this correlation between schizophrenia and the claustrum is that there is an increase in white matter volume entering the claustrum. Inverse correlations between grey matter volume and severity of hallucinations in the context of auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia has been supported. As well, to see the total loss of function of the claustrum, lesions to both claustrums on each hemisphere would need to occur.

However, a study in 2019, consisting of electrical stimulation of the claustrum, found no disruption of consciousness in any of the five patients that were subjected to the analysis. The tested patients reported subjective experiences in various sensory domains and exhibited reflexive movement, but none of them displayed loss of consciousness, thus questioning the claustrum&#x27;s ability to disrupt consciousness when stimulated electrically.

== Clinical significance ==

===Schizophrenia===
Damage to the claustrum may mimic various common diseases or mental disorders; delayed development of the structure appears to be linked to autism. The claustrum may be involved in schizophrenia as findings show an increase in positive symptoms, such as delusions, when the grey matter volume of the left claustrum and right insula is decreased.
===Epilepsy===
The claustrum is also seen to play a role in epilepsy; MRIs have found increased claustral signal intensity in people who have been diagnosed with epilepsy. In certain cases, seizures tend to appear to originate from the claustrum when they are involved in early kainic acid induced seizures.

===Consciousness===
A single case-study showed that consciousness was disrupted when the area between the insula and claustrum was electrically stimulated; consciousness was regained when stimulation stopped. Patients that had a lesion in their left claustrum were more likely to experience a loss of consciousness compared to those that presented with lesions outside of the claustrum. For example, a patient that was subjected to electrode stimulation at the claustrum stopped reading, stared blankly and was unresponsive. Once the electrode was removed, the patient resumed reading and could not remember the events of being dazed.

A 2019 study consisting of electrical stimulation of the claustrum found no disruption of consciousness in any of the five patients that were subjected to the analysis. The tested patients reported subjective experiences in various sensory domains and exhibited reflexive movement, but none of them displayed loss of consciousness, thus questioning the claustrum&#x27;s ability to disrupt consciousness when stimulated electrically.

A 2020 study involving artificial activation of the claustrum by optogenetic light stimulation silenced brain activity across the cortex, a phenomenon known as a &quot;Down state,&quot; which can be seen when mice are sleeping or resting awake (quiet wakefulness). The authors state that &#x27;The claustrum is a coordinator of global slow-wave activity, and it is so exciting that we are getting closer to linking specific brain connections and actions with the ultimate puzzle of consciousness.&#x27; 

However, cognitive scientist Stevan Harnad does not consider the claustrum to be a &quot;switch&quot; for consciousness, but merely for wakefulness. He claims that if the claustrum were truly a switch for consciousness, artificial activation of the claustrum would not result in the patient passing out, but instead the patient would continue behaving normally, and later report that they experienced no sensations during the period of time when their claustrum was being stimulated.

=== Psilocybin ===
The claustrum expresses a high density of 5-HT2A receptors, meaning it is significantly affected by serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin. Psilocybin appears to affect the functional connectivity of the claustrum with the default mode network (DMN), and the fronto-parietal task control network (FPTC). Psilocybin was found to significantly decrease functional connectivity of the right claustrum with the default mode network, and increase right claustrum connectivity with the fronto-parietal task control network.

===Parkinsonism===
A team of investigators led by neuroscientists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has identified lesions in the claustrum as the likely origin of parkinsonism across different conditions. The team used a novel methodology called lesion network mapping to discover the origins of parkinsonism in 29 patients whose symptoms were not the result of Parkinson&#x27;s disease but rather attributed to a brain lesion – an abnormality or injury to the brain visible on brain imaging. The mapping of the 29 lesions – which were located in different regions of the brain – revealed that connectivity to the claustrum was the single most sensitive and specific marker of lesion-induced parkinsonism.

===Anxiety and stress===
In mice, suppression of claustrum appears to attenuate anxiety/stress and increase chronic stress-resistance.

== Other animals ==
In animals, through tract tracing, findings have shown that the claustrum has extensive connections throughout the cortex with sensory and motor regions along with the hippocampus. A variety of animal models have been used such as cats, rodents and monkeys. 
===Cats===

In cats, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the claustrum can alter motor activity, induce autonomic changes, and precipitate an “inactivation syndrome” described as “decreased awareness&quot;. Recordings, primarily in cats and primates, show that claustral neurons respond to sensory stimuli and also respond during voluntary movements. Mapping from visual cortex to claustrum includes just a single map, which includes V1 and three other visual areas. Cells in the V1 are part of layer 6, and are different to cells that go to the lateral geniculate nucleus; these cells use glutamate as their neurotransmitter.

The cat claustrum has 3 defined zones: (1) the anterior dorsal zone, which connects to the motor and somatosensory cortex, (2) the posterior dorsal zone that has connections to the visual cortex and (3) a third zone that is ventral to the visual one and connects to the auditory areas.

Sensory input is segregated based on modalities and there is a high preference for peripheral sensory information. In the cat, input is received from various visual cortical areas and projects back to the area. These loops are retinotopical, meaning that regions getting visual input are responsible for the same region in the visual field as the area of the cortex that projects to the claustrum. The visual claustrum is a single map of the contralateral visual hemifield, receiving information based on motion in the visual field&#x27;s periphery and has no real selectivity.

In terms of somatosensation, cat claustrum receives dense inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1), but weaker inputs from secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). The inputs from S1 overlap with inputs from primary motor cortex (at least those from the forepaw representations of both). Rodent claustrum does not receive input from S1 or S2, and is primarily driven by motor cortex.

===Rodents===
In rats, motor whisker areas receive input from the ipsilateral claustrum but will then project to the contralateral claustrum. The sensory barrel cortex and primary visual cortex also receive input from the ipsilateral claustrum but send very few projection back to the claustrum. Studies therefore indicate distinct patterning of connectivity of claustrum with different cortical areas. These suggest, rather than a diffuse role, they play specialized roles in cortical processing.

In mice, parvalbumin fibres are highly interconnected by chemical and electrical synapses. They are additionally also highly interconnected with claustrocortical neurons – suggesting that these inhibitory interneurons strongly modulate their activity. These local networks suggest to synchronize activity of claustrocortical projections to therefore influence brain rhythms and co-ordinated activity of different cortical brain regions. There are additional classes of inhibitory interneurons with local connections within the claustrocortical neurons.

Experiments in mice monitoring claustrocortical axonal activity to changing visual stimuli suggest the claustrum signals stimulus changes. Although claustrocortical input to visual cortical areas were engaged, the strongest responses measured were in higher-order regions of the cortex, this included the anterior cingulate cortex which is densely innervated by claustral projection.

===Monkeys===
In the monkey, there are widespread connections of the claustrum with allocortical and neocortical regions. These connections project towards the frontal lobe, visual cortical regions, temporal cortex, parieto-occipital cortex and somatosensory areas amongst others. The subcortical areas receiving projections are the amygdala, caudate nucleus and hippocampus. It is unknown if there are cortical regions that do not receive input from the claustrum. Additionally, large or small types of aspiny neurons are reported in the monkey brain, which are classified as “local circuit neurons&quot;.

The dorsal claustrum has bi-directional connections with motor structures in the cortex. The relationship between the animal&#x27;s movement and how neurons in the dorsocaudal claustrum behave are as follows: 70% of movement neurons are non-selective and can fire to do any push, pull or turn movements in the forelimb; the rest were more discerning and did only one of the three movements listed above.

<doc id="555817" wikidata="Q2470001" url="?curid=555817" title="Outlaw Star">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese media mix primarily consisting of an anime television series produced by Sunrise (now a division of Bandai Namco Filmworks) and a corresponding &quot;seinen&quot; manga series written and illustrated by Takehiko Itō. The series takes place in the &quot;Toward Stars Era&quot; universe in which spacecraft are capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. The plot follows protagonist Gene Starwind and his motley crew of an inherited ship dubbed the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, as they search for a legendary outer space treasure trove called the &quot;Galactic Leyline&quot;.

Planned by Sunrise (under the Hajime Yatate pseudonym) and Itō, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; first appeared as a manga originally serialized in the monthly Shueisha magazine &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; between 1996 and 1999 for a total of 21 chapters. Three volumes of collected chapters were published in Japan between August 1997 and January 1999. Although no official English version of the manga exists, it has been published in Chinese, German, Italian, and Spanish. Sunrise produced a 26-episode anime adaptation that was directed by Mitsuru Hongo and aired on the Japanese station TV Tokyo in early 1998. The animated series has since been translated and broadcast worldwide.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; This includes an English version from Bandai Entertainment that received an edited airing on the North American Cartoon Network blocks Toonami in early 2001 and later on Adult Swim in early 2002. &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; has been licensed for release in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment and in Europe by Beez Entertainment. A few Japanese-exclusive audio CDs and light novels have been spawned since the start of the manga&#x27;s publication.

Critical reception for &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; has been mostly positive. Many reviewers praised the anime series, particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements. However, some found fault with the show&#x27;s pacing, believing that the storyline quality begins to wane after the first few episodes. Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled , which aired in Japan in 1999. Preliminary plans were made to create a direct sequel in the form of a single-episode (OVA) called &quot;Sword of Wind&quot;, but production never began.

==Plot==

&quot;Outlaw Star&quot; is a space opera/space Western set in the fictional universe. During its past, an asteroid containing a material known as &quot;dragonite&quot; crashed in the fictional Arashon desert of northern China. Scientists found that the dragonite contained properties related to &quot;ether&quot;, an energy source that would allow spacecraft to travel faster than the speed of light, and thus traverse large distances of the universe in a short time. As new colonies were formed throughout the vast reaches of outer space, pirates, assassins, and outlaws began to threaten humanity&#x27;s new frontier. To create order, the Earth Federation established four empires: USSA, Einhorn, Piotr, and Tenpa. However, internal power struggles within the factions and conflicts amongst one another become abundant, leading to inevitable lawlessness. The storyline starts shortly after an infamous outlaw named &quot;Hot Ice&quot; Hilda flees from the Kei Pirates, a branch of the Tin&#x27;Pa. Hilda has stolen from them a highly-advanced prototype ship dubbed the &quot;XGP15A-II&quot; and a suitcase containing a bio-android called Melfina, the only being capable of interfacing with the ship.

&quot;Outlaw Star&quot; opens on the backwater planet Sentinel III, on which the protagonist Gene Starwind and his 11-year-old business associate and best friend James &quot;Jim&quot; Hawking run a small jack-of-all-trades business. After the two take a job as bodyguards for a disguised Hilda and engage in a brief skirmish with the Kei Pirates, Gene and Jim find themselves the owners of the XGP15A-II (which they nickname the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;) and the caretakers of Melfina, though Hilda is killed in the process. Hilda reveals that the ship&#x27;s true purpose is to locate the , a place which popular claims say is a holder of immense treasure, knowledge, and power. Throughout the course of the series, the crew grows to include the kimono-garbed contract killer &quot;Twilight&quot; Suzuka and the Ctarl-Ctarl alien catgirl Aisha Clanclan.

The &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; manga series and animated television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship&#x27;s massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, a pair of bounty hunters responsible for the death of Gene&#x27;s father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star&#x27;s connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.

==Production==
&quot;Outlaw Star&quot; was created by Morning Star Studio. Takehiko Itō was the manga&#x27;s director, writer, and chief artist. Itō was aided in his duties by Hajime Yatate, a pseudonym of writers at Sunrise. Others who contributed to the work include producer Kenzoh Tomita; starship designer Shoji Kawamori; character concept and imageboard illustrators Yutaka Minowa and Hajime Jinguji; and a team of production designers and assistant artists. &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; takes place in the Toward Stars Era, the same universe as Itō&#x27;s , a pulp-science fiction manga that was first serialized by Kadokawa Shoten in 1988. Itō has described this earlier work as &quot;something out of boy&#x27;s dream&quot; and took a much more mature, scientific approach when writing &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;. The author also referenced aspects of Chinese culture when creating &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;.

The animated television series of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; was produced by Sunrise and directed by Mitsuru Hongo, whose previous credits include the comedy &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; and the magical girl series &quot;Shamanic Princess&quot;. The script was chiefly written by , who wrote about three-quarters of the episodes. Character designs were handled by Hiroyuki Hataike (&quot;Detonator Orgun&quot;, &quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&quot;) and Takuya Saito. The show&#x27;s vehicles were designed by and &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Gundam&quot; mecha artist Shōji Kawamori, the latter of whom designed the Outlaw Star ship itself. Kow Otani composed the musical score for the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; anime. The series features the opening theme &quot;Through the Night&quot; written and performed Masahiko Arimachi, and two closing themes, and , both written and performed by Akino Arai. &quot;Through the Night&quot; was chosen for the opening among several candidate songs. Itō and Sunrise agreed that the theme should be one that had not been used in a recent animation and that it should feature male vocals. Arimachi wrote the song to resemble a story, took into account its long-term impact, and felt it fit &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; perfectly.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Outlaw Star&quot; was serialized in Japan&#x27;s monthly Shueisha magazine &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; between 1996 and 1999. A total of 21 chapters were published, and 17 of these chapters were compiled among three &quot;tankōbon&quot; (collected volumes), released in Japan from August 1997 to January 1999. Each volume also contains information on the series&#x27; universe; detailed spaceship and planet descriptions; and character profiles. A Chinese version of the manga was published in Hong Kong by Sharp Point Press. The series has also been published in German and Italian by Planet Manga. No official English translation of the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; exists, though Morning Star Studio&#x27;s official website suggests that a release in the United States was planned at one time.

===Anime===
The 26-episode anime adaptation of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; began broadcasting in Japan on TV Tokyo from January 8, 1998, and ended on June 25, 1998, though the broadcast began on January 9, as it was in a 1:15 A.M. time slot. The series was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. The English version was produced by ZRO Limit Productions and was aired on the evening Toonami block beginning on January 15, 2001 
and ended on February 21, 2001. This broadcast of the show was heavily edited due to its adult content. Profanity was removed, scenes with violence and lewd behavior were cut or toned down, and many scenes containing nudity were altered by digitally inserting clothing onto characters. Episode 23, in which the Outlaw Star crew visits a hot spring planet, was not aired due to nudity and suggestive themes. However, some instances of adult language were not removed for the anime&#x27;s initial run. Toonami&#x27;s creative director Sean Akins claimed that Cartoon Network made all of their own edits to their licensed properties during this time period, which they did &quot;in a way that preserves the story&quot;. The role of Fred Luo, a recurring homosexual character, was considerably toned down. Cartoon Network had no specific editing policy with regard to gay characters, but that &quot;overt sexuality or implied sexuality of any kind are not allowed&quot;. &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; was also aired on the late night Adult Swim block throughout 2002. However, the broadcast was cancelled late in the year and (according to Akins) the network allowed its rights to the anime to expire by 2003. &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; was aired in the United Kingdom on CNX in October 2002. 

Bandai released the first 13 episodes of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; on DVD in Japan on August 25, 1999, and the remaining 13 episodes on November 25, 1999. A Japanese &quot;remastered&quot; DVD boxset containing the entire series was published by Bandai on September 22, 2006. Yet another DVD boxset, &quot;Emotion the Best: Seihō Bukyō Outlaw Star&quot;, was released in Japan on September 24, 2010. Bandai released the series in North America in three DVD collections on September 1, 2000, February 14, 2001, and March 6, 2001. The &quot;Outlaw Star Perfect Collection Box Set&quot;, a DVD compilation of the entire series, was released on September 10, 2002. The series was again re-released on March 28, 2006, as the &quot;Outlaw Star Complete Collection&quot;. &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; additionally received DVD releases in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment on June 23, 2004, and in the United Kingdom by Beez Entertainment on April 25, 2011. Following the closure of Beez, the show was re-licensed by Anime Limited who would re-release the series in 2013. At Otakon 2013, Funimation and Sunrise had announced that they have rescued &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, along with a handful of other former BEI titles. In October 2014, the entire series was released in Japan for the first time on Blu-Ray, with the set including such features as staff commentary, an art gallery board, book breaks of Gene and Melfina, and various songs.

On March 16, 2017, Funimation announced that &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; would be released in North America in both standard and Collector&#x27;s Editions on June 13, 2017. Each edition includes a DVD and Blu-ray copy of the series, while the Collector&#x27;s Edition comes in a metallic chipboard artbox designed after the XGP-15A2 and includes a 100-page artbook. Following Funimation&#x27;s acquisition of the series, it aired again on Cartoon Network as part of Adult Swim on the Toonami programming block starting on August 20, 2017, and concluding on March 18, 2018. Due to its late night broadcast on Adult Swim, the anime was aired with fewer edits and included the U.S. television premiere of episode 23.

===CDs===
The opening theme and the two closing themes of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; were published in Japan in 1998 as CD singles by Victor Entertainment and JVC respectively. Victor Entertainment published a two-volume original soundtrack for the series on March 31, 1998, and June 24, 1998. The CDs consist of a total of 61 background and vocal music tracks. Another two-disc album containing several drama tracks, , was released on August 21, 1998.

===Light novels===
A series of light novels based on &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; has been released in Japan by Shueisha under its &quot;Super Dash Bunko&quot; label. , was written by Katsuhiko Tiba (千葉 克彦 &quot;Chiba Katsuhiko&quot;), illustrated by Takuya Saitou (斎藤 卓也 &quot;Saitō Takuya&quot;), and released in two volumes in October 1998 and February 1999. The two books are an adaptation of the anime series, retelling the early events that trigger Gene and company&#x27;s search for the Galactic Leyline. Another light novel, , was written by Miho Sakai, illustrated by Takuya Saitou, and released as a single volume on July 14, 2000. The novel features an original plot involving the Outlaw Star crew pursuing a serial killer named Billy McAglen in a mining town called El Dorado.

===Other merchandise===
A hardcover guidebook titled was published by Fujimi Shobo as part of its &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; imprint in November 1998. The guide contains summaries of the manga and anime, character profiles, sketches, animation cels, and interviews with the production staff. In 2001, Bandai released an &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; action figure set as part of a line based on its licensed anime franchises. The set contains the Outlaw Star ship and the characters Gene and Melfina. Asako Nishida, one of the show&#x27;s animation directors, compiled her contributions to the Toward Stars Era franchise in a 2009 art book.

==Reception==
Critical reception for &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; has been favorable. Eric Luce, Ivevei Upatkoon, and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga, Japanese anime, and English anime versions of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; respectively. Luce was complimentary of the manga&#x27;s &quot;raw&quot; yet &quot;good and distinctive&quot; artwork, detailed backgrounds, and good placement of characters among one another. However, he was annoyed that all the women have a &quot;disturbing tendency to all have the same silicone stiffened chests&quot; and that characters typically wear mad grins. Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good, and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs. He also appreciated the show&#x27;s dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter, shown by the titular ship in its grappler mode and how it communicates with the crew. Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime&#x27;s best characterization: &quot;Gene Starwind is a sly, sharp-shooting hero whose success with his gun (and with the ladies) is matched only by his propensity to get space-sick. Imagine that: the star of a space-faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel. This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters.&quot; Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well, and was impressed by the &quot;sharp but fluid&quot; animation style and the spaceship designs. Mania.com&#x27;s David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters, nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable. Jacob Churosh of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout. Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; to be superb, &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be &quot;less lucky&quot; and lacking in &quot;the special aura&quot; of Sunrise&#x27;s acclaimed 1998 series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, authors of &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot; agreeably denoted &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; as &quot;no competition for &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; in terms of style, content, or execution&quot;.

Critical reception for the plot of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990&#x27;s science fiction anime, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; manages to transcend them as well. &quot;Maybe it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere that other series haven&#x27;t already been&quot;, the reviewer stated. &quot;But boy, does it have a damn good time getting there.&quot; Upatkoon observed that the plot &quot;[takes] off with a bang at the beginning&quot; and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of &quot;Animerica&quot; also noted this about the anime&#x27;s pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show&#x27;s writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from &quot;unfocused scripting&quot; and that &quot;one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing&quot;. However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.

&quot;Outlaw Star&quot; has received very modest commercial success and miscellaneous viewer recognition. The initial shipment of the manga&#x27;s first volume sold out nationwide in Japan. According to Morning Star Studio&#x27;s English website, the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; manga has sold 250,000 copies, though the anime series was less successful. The &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; television series was aired in Japan during a late night timeslot because it was not likely to obtain more than one or two percent viewership like prime time shows. &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; was voted as the 20th best anime of 1999 in the Japanese &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix. During a summer 2001 online poll to determine which show would return to Toonami, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; received approximately two-thirds of the more than 150,000 votes cast. In August 2002, Cartoon Network announced that the late-night Adult Swim &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; received a Nielsen rating of 0.9, up 125 percent for that same time slot and a delivery of 414,000, up 135 percent for the 18–34 age range. The &quot;Outlaw Star Complete Collection&quot; was the 21st best-selling anime DVD in the United States in 2006 and the 25th in 2007. In 2012, Bandai&#x27;s North American division, Bandai Entertainment, listed &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; as one of its top five most successful anime properties. Josh Pool of IGN listed &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; at number six on its &quot;Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time&quot;, noting a stark polarity between the opening and ending themes.

==Legacy==
In 1999, Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled . &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; and &quot;Angel Links&quot; take place in the same universe; characters from both series appeared in an episode of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, but the two have little else in relation. Morning Star Studio also drafted a proposed sequel to &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; in the form of a single-episode OVA special titled &quot;Outlaw Star 2: Sword of Wind&quot; on its official website with character designs and a plot outline. Set three years after the events of &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, it was to continue the adventures of Gene Starwind in his new starship named &quot;Sword of Wind&quot;. Due to the lack of the franchise&#x27;s popularity in Japan and the busy schedule of animation director Mitsuru Hongo, no production date was set. In October 2001, Takehiko Itō commented that his team only had static, preliminary plans for the sequel series and that they could perhaps continue the manga series in the future.

<text>The Sheffield Sharks, currently known as B.Braun Sheffield Sharks for sponsorship reasons, are a professional basketball team from the city of Sheffield, England. The Sharks compete in the Super League Basketball and play their home matches at Park Community Arena, which opened in 2023. They are one of the most successful teams in the history of British basketball and dominated domestic competitions throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.

==History==

===Sheffield Forgers===
The club was established in 1991 when the team, then called the Sheffield Forgers in reference to the city&#x27;s history as a major steel producer, were admitted to National Basketball League Division 2. After two seasons competing in the division, with an overall 26–16 record, the Forgers were crowned Champions in 1993 and promoted to NBL Division 1.

The 1993–1994 season would prove to be another successful one for the Forgers having reached the National Trophy final where they beat Plymouth Raiders 62–60 on &quot;home&quot; territory at the Sheffield Arena. Their stay in the First Division did not last long, and although they finished in 4th position with a 10–8 record, the Forgers were admitted to the professional top-tier British Basketball League as a new franchise to replace the withdrawing Guildford Kings.

===Rebranding as the Sharks===
The club was purchased by the Chrysalis Group in 1994 and rebranded as Sheffield Sharks. On court, the team dominated the league in its rookie season, and with a 29–7 league record, marched on to take the BBL League Championship and National Cup with an incredible 89–66 victory in the final against Thames Valley Tigers. However the Tigers got their revenge over the Sharks with a nail-biting 74–69 win in the BBL Trophy final. The Sharks also missed out on the playoff final following a 72–84 loss to Worthing Bears in the Final Four, despite this the Sheffield team still enjoyed a phenomenal debut season.

===European leagues===

In 1995, the 1995 McDonald&#x27;s Championship came to London and the Sharks were entered as the host team, mixing with the elite of world basketball including the NBA&#x27;s Houston Rockets, Spanish League giants Real Madrid and Bologna of the Italian League amongst others. Sheffield finished the series 0–2, following defeats to Real Madrid and Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Sharks&#x27; adventure continued into Europe in the following season (1995–96) when they competed in the prestigious Euroleague. After knocking out Luxembourg-based team Residence Helmsange in the qualifying round, the Sharks were then eliminated in the first round by Real Madrid after a 57–67 defeat in Sheffield and a 75–78 defeat in Madrid. As a result of losing, Sheffield were then placed in the Third Round of the less glamorous European Cup, where they were subsequently knocked out by Belgian League club Oostende Basket, thus ending their European adventure.

On the domestic scene, the Sharks could not repeat the highs of their previous season, finishing as Runners-up in the League Championship (30–6) to London Towers, and losing the final of the National Cup 58–70 also to the dominating Towers. Their playoff dreams were also shattered in the semifinals by eventual winners Birmingham Bullets, whom they lost to 68–82.

===Golden Era===
The Sharks again reached the BBL Cup final in 1996 and 1997, finishing second then third in the championship, and their next piece of silverware was the 1998 BBL Trophy. They claimed their second BBL Cup and championship double in 1999, with Terrell Myers picked as League MVP, before successfully defending the Cup in 2000 after reaching their fifth Cup final in six years. It was during the most successful period of the clubs’ history that owners Chrysalis Group decided to sell off their majority stake. After running into off-court financial difficulties and on the brink of a wind-up order from the BBL, the franchise was acquired by Montgomery Leisure Services Ltd in 2001, the same year that a first Play-off final appearance was secured in after topping the championship. However it was Leicester Riders who triumphed 84–75, and the Sharks were beaten again in the play-off final the following year, 93–82 by Cheshire Jets. The Sharks claimed their third Championship in five years in 2003 and although they failed to reach the play-off final, they got there the following year after a second-placed league finish. It was the Sharks&#x27; third playoff final in four years and a case of third time lucky as they beat Cheshire 86–74.

===Modern era===

In the 2009–2010 season, Sheffield won the BBL Cup for the first time in six years beating the Cheshire Jets 89–86. During the 2010–2011 season, they successfully defended their cup victory by beating the Mersey Tigers 93–66 and also made it to the final of the playoffs but were beaten out by Mersey Tigers 79–74. In the 2012–2013 season, the Sharks won the BBL Trophy for the first time in 15 years beating the Leicester Riders 71–69. In the 2015–2016 season, Sheffield made it to the Play Off final for the first time in five years. This time however, for the first time in 12 years the Sharks in the final of the playoffs on 8 May 2016, beat Leicester Riders 84–77.

<doc id="555819" wikidata="Q5481613" url="?curid=555819" title="One-Tonne Challenge">
<text>The One-Tonne Challenge was a challenge presented by the Government of Canada in March 2004 for Canadians to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by one tonne each year. The figure represented 20% of total greenhouse gas output by Canadians at the time and aimed to help the country reach its Kyoto Protocol emission reduction targets. The Liberal Government under Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin approved over $45 million to fund the program from 2003 to 2006.

To promote this program, the government placed television and print ads featuring comedian Rick Mercer. In one commercial, he described Canadians as wanting to take the challenge. &quot;C’mon... we’re Canadian... we’re up for a challenge!&quot;

The government urged Canadians to do such things as:

* take public transit more often
* idle vehicles less
* use programmable thermostats
* seal windows with caulking and weather-stripping
* compost organic kitchen waste
* support green energy
* water and energy conservation
* purchase electronics that are labelled with Energy Star logo
* recycling

The program received a lukewarm reception from the public, and has been criticized as ineffective and wasteful.

This program was started by the Liberal Party of Canada. However, with the election of Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative Government in 2006, the One Tonne Challenge was scrapped.

<text>Earl Amherst (), of Arracan in the East Indies, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 19 December 1826, for William Amherst, 2nd Baron Amherst, the Governor-General of India. He was made Viscount Holmesdale, in the County of Kent, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Lord Amherst had succeeded his uncle Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, as second Baron Amherst in 1797. The latter was a distinguished military commander best known as one of the victors of the French and Indian War. In 1776, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Amherst, of Holmesdale in the County of Kent, with normal remainder to heirs male of his body. In 1788, he was created Baron Amherst, of Montreal in the County of Kent, also in the Peerage of Great Britain, with special remainder to his nephew William Pitt Amherst and the heirs male of his body. 
The 1776 barony became extinct on his death in 1797, while he was succeeded in the 1778 barony as second Baron according to the special remainder by his nephew, William Amherst, who later was elevated to an earldom in 1826.

The first Earl was succeeded in 1857, by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl, who prior to his ennoblement had represented East Grinstead in the House of Commons. On his death in 1886 the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a soldier and politician, who in 1880 had been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Amherst. He died childless in 1910 and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. The latter was one of the 112 peers who voted against the passing of the Parliament Act 1911. In 1927, he was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl, on whose death in 1993, the titles became extinct.

John Amherst (), brother of the first baron, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. William Amherst, brother of the first baron and father of the first earl, was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army.

<text>John Treworgie (born ca. 1618, date of death unknown) was the last Proprietary Governor of Newfoundland. Treworgie had worked as an agent at a Kittery, Maine trading post from 1635 to 1650. In 1651 he was named as one of a party of six sent to Newfoundland to arrest Sir David Kirke who had been accused of withholding taxes collected on behalf of the crown and otherwise violating the royal charter which granted him the governorship of Newfoundland. His party was also ordered to administer the fishery and collect taxes on fish and oil from foreign fishermen. He remained after the arrest of Kirke and was named governor by the English government and given authority over both migratory fisherman and colonists and ordered to fortify the colony. John Treworgie was the son of James Treworgie (or Treworgy), the son-in-law of Alexander Shapleigh, a Devonshire merchant and fisheries owner who founded Kittery, Maine. John Treworgie was the brother-in-law of Hon. John Gilman of Exeter, New Hampshire.

In 1654 Treworgie and two other commissioners were arrested for illegally taking possession of David Kirke&#x27;s property and was found guilty. Oliver Cromwell ordered a second trial which cleared him and Treworgie continued as governor until 1660.

In 1660, he asked for another term as governor but the legal conflict between Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore and the Kirke family over ownership of Newfoundland complicated matters and it is unlikely Treworgie ever returned to the island.
