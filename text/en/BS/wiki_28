<text>In mathematics, the Champernowne constant is a transcendental real constant whose decimal expansion has important properties. It is named after economist and mathematician D. G. Champernowne, who published it as an undergraduate in 1933. The number is defined by concatenating the base-10 representations of the positive integers:

Champernowne constants can also be constructed in other bases similarly; for example,
and

The Champernowne word or Barbier word is the sequence of digits of &quot;C&quot;10 obtained by writing it in base 10 and juxtaposing the digits:

More generally, a &quot;Champernowne sequence&quot; (sometimes also called a &quot;Champernowne word&quot;) is any sequence of digits obtained by concatenating all finite digit-strings (in any given base) in some recursive order.
For instance, the binary Champernowne sequence in shortlex order is
where spaces (otherwise to be ignored) have been inserted just to show the strings being concatenated.

== Properties ==
A real number &quot;x&quot; is said to be &quot;normal&quot; if its digits in every base follow a uniform distribution: all digits being equally likely, all pairs of digits equally likely, all triplets of digits equally likely, etc. A number &quot;x&quot; is said to be normal in base &quot;b&quot; if its digits in base &quot;b&quot; follow a uniform distribution.

If we denote a digit string as [&quot;a&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;1, ...], then, in base 10, we would expect strings [0], [1], [2], …, [9] to occur 1/10 of the time, strings [0,0], [0,1], ..., [9,8], [9,9] to occur 1/100 of the time, and so on, in a normal number.

Champernowne proved that formula_1 is normal in base 10, while Nakai and Shiokawa proved a more general theorem, a corollary of which is that formula_2 is normal in base formula_3 for any &quot;b&quot;. It is an open problem whether formula_4 is normal in bases formula_5. For example, it is not known if formula_1 is normal in base 9. For example, 54 digits of formula_1 is 0.123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313. When we express this in base 9 we get formula_8.

Kurt Mahler showed that the constant is transcendental.
The irrationality measure of formula_1 is formula_10, and more generally formula_11 for any base formula_12.

The Champernowne word is a disjunctive sequence. A disjunctive sequence is an infinite sequence (over a finite alphabet of characters) in which every finite string appears as a substring

== Series ==
The definition of the Champernowne constant immediately gives rise to an infinite series representation involving a double sum,
formula_13 
where formula_14 is the number of digits between the decimal point and the first contribution from an -digit base-10 number; these expressions generalize to an arbitrary base  by replacing 10 and 9 with and respectively. Alternative forms are
formula_15
and
formula_16
where formula_17 and formula_18 denote the floor and ceiling functions.

Returning to the first of these series, both the summand of the outer sum and the expression for formula_19 can be simplified using the closed form for the two-dimensional geometric series:
formula_20

The resulting expression for formula_19 is
formula_22
while the summand of the outer sum becomes
formula_23
Summing over all gives
formula_24
Observe that in the summand, the expression in parentheses is approximately formula_25 for and rapidly approaches that value as grows, while the exponent formula_26 grows exponentially with . As a consequence, each additional term provides an exponentially growing number of correct digits even though the number of digits in the numerators and denominators of the fractions comprising these terms grows only linearly. For example, the first few terms of are
formula_27

== Continued fraction expansion ==
The simple continued fraction expansion of Champernowne&#x27;s constant does not terminate (because the constant is not rational) and is aperiodic (because it is not an irreducible quadratic). A simple continued fraction is a continued fraction where the denominator is 1. The simple continued fraction expansion of Champernowne&#x27;s constant exhibits extremely large terms appearing between many small ones. For example, in base 10,
: &quot;C&quot;10 = [0; 8, 9, 1, 149083, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 15, 4 57540 11139 10310 76483 64662 82429 56118 59960 39397 10457 55500 06620 04393 09026 26592 56314 93795 32077 47128 65631 38641 20937 55035 52094 60718 30899 84575 80146 98631 48833 59214 17830 10987, 6, 1, 1, ...]. 

The large number at position 18 has 166 digits, and the next very large term at position 40 of the continued fraction has 2504 digits. That there are such large numbers as terms of the continued fraction expansion means that the convergents obtained by stopping before these large numbers provide an exceptionally good approximation of the Champernowne constant. For example, truncating just before the 4th partial quotient, gives 
formula_28
which matches the first term in the rapidly converging series expansion of the previous section and which approximates Champernowne&#x27;s constant with an error of about . Truncating just before the 18th partial quotient gives an approximation that matches the first two terms of the series, that is, the terms up to the term containing ,
formula_29
which approximates Champernowne&#x27;s constant with error approximately .

The first and second incrementally largest terms (&quot;high-water marks&quot;) after the initial zero are 8 and 9, respectively, and occur at positions 1 and 2. Sikora (2012) noticed that the number of digits in the high-water marks starting with the fourth display an apparent pattern. Indeed, the high-water marks themselves grow doubly-exponentially, and the number of digits formula_30 in the &quot;n&quot;th mark for formula_31 are

:6, 166, 2504, 33102, 411100, 4911098, 57111096, 651111094, 7311111092, ...

whose pattern becomes obvious starting with the 6th high-water mark. The number of terms can be given by
formula_32

However, it is still unknown as to whether or not there is a way to determine where the large terms (with at least 6 digits) occur, or their values. The high-water marks themselves are located at positions

:1, 2, 4, 18, 40, 162, 526, 1708, 4838, 13522, 34062, ...

<text>The Eyalet of Anatolia () was one of the two core provinces (Rumelia being the other) in the early years of the Ottoman Empire. It was established in 1393. Its capital was first Ankara in central Anatolia, but then moved to Kütahya in western Anatolia. Its reported area in the 19th century was . 

The establishment of the province of Anatolia is held to have been in 1393, when Sultan Bayezid I ( 1389–1402) appointed Kara Timurtash as &quot;beylerbey&quot; and viceroy was in Anatolia, during Bayezid&#x27;s absence on campaign in Europe against Mircea I of Wallachia. The province of Anatolia—initially termed &quot;beylerbeylik&quot; or generically &quot;vilayet&quot; (&quot;province&quot;), only after 1591 was the term &quot;eyalet&quot; used—was the second to be formed after the Rumelia Eyalet, and ranked accordingly in the hierarchy of the provinces. The first capital of the province was Ankara, but in the late 15th century it was moved to Kütahya.

As part of the Tanzimat reforms, the Anatolia Eyalet was dissolved and divided into smaller provinces, although various scholars give conflicting dates for the dissolution, from as early as 1832 to as late as 1864.

<text>Fordlândia (, &quot;Ford-land&quot;) is a district and adjacent area of in the city of Aveiro, in the Brazilian state of Pará. It is located on the east banks of the Tapajós river roughly south of the city of Santarém.

It was established by American industrialist Henry Ford in the Amazon Rainforest in 1928 as a prefabricated industrial town intended to be inhabited by 10,000 people to secure a source of cultivated rubber for the automobile manufacturing operations of the Ford Motor Company in the United States. Ford had negotiated a deal with the Brazilian government granting him a concession of of land on the banks of the Rio Tapajós near the city of Santarém, Brazil, in exchange for a 9% share in the profits generated. Ford&#x27;s project failed, and the city was abandoned in 1934.

The town was mostly deserted, with only 90 residents still living in the city until the early 2000s when it saw an increase of population, being home to around 3,000 people .

==Background==

In the 1920s, the Ford Motor Company sought to elude the British monopoly over the supply of rubber, mainly used for producing tires and other car parts. Henry Ford looked for alternatives and a permanent place to establish a colony to produce rubber. Central America was considered; however, information about the rubber trees in the Amazon was uncovered and this, along with other factors, caused a change of plans.

Negotiations with the Brazilian government started during the visit by then-governor of the State of Pará, , to the United States to meet Ford. An agreement was signed and the American industrialist received an area of about 2.5 million acres (10,100 km2) called &quot;Boa Vista&quot;. The agreement exempted Ford from taxes on the exportation of goods produced in Brazil in exchange for 9% of the profits, 7% going to the Brazilian government and 2% of profits to local municipalities.

==History==
Work on the area began in 1926 by the &quot;Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil&quot;. It was immediately hindered by poor logistics and diseases that affected the workers who succumbed to yellow fever and malaria. No roads were available in the area thus the area was only accessible by the Tapajós River. The site was developed as a planned community with different areas of the city being designated for the Brazilian workers and the American managers, who lived in the so-called American Village. Typical American houses were built, as were a hospital, school, library, and hotel. The town also had a swimming pool, a playground, and a golf course.

In 1928, the Ford Motor Company sent two merchant ships – &quot;Lake Ormoc&quot; and &quot;Lake Farge&quot; – loaded with equipment and furnishings ranging from doorknobs to the town&#x27;s water tower. The town was then founded under the name Fordlândia.

Seeking workers, several offices were opened in the cities of Belém and Manaus, and, with the promise of good wages, people of the nearby states answered.

In lower temperatures, the latex is concentrated in the lower areas of the tree, as the temperature rises during the day the latex spreads throughout the tree, making the tapping less effective. Due to this, the typical journey of a rubber tapper began early in the morning, at around 5 am, ending at noon. The plantation was divided into areas and each worker was assigned to a different area to prevent workers from tapping the same trees successively.

The town had a strict set of rules imposed by the managers. Alcohol, women, tobacco and even association football were forbidden within the town, including inside the workers&#x27; own homes. Inspectors (American managers) would go from house to house to check how organized the houses were and to enforce these rules. The inhabitants circumvented these prohibitions by paddling out to merchant riverboats moored beyond the town jurisdiction, often hiding contraband goods inside fruits like watermelons. A small settlement was established upstream on the &quot;Island of Innocence&quot; with bars, nightclubs and brothels.

The land was hilly, rocky and infertile. None of Ford&#x27;s managers had the requisite knowledge of tropical agriculture. In the wild, the rubber trees grow apart from each other as a protection mechanism against plagues and diseases, often growing close to bigger trees of other species for added support. In Fordlândia, however, the trees were planted close together in plantations, easy prey for tree blight, Saúva ants, lace bugs, red spiders, and leaf caterpillars.

Greg Grandin, whose father was a construction engineer in Fordlândia, enjoyed spending time with his father while he worked in Brazil. Within Grandin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford&#x27;s Forgotten Jungle City&quot;, he explains how &quot;Ford had very particular understandings about what a proper diet should be … He tried to impose brown rice and whole-wheat bread and canned peaches and oatmeal — and that itself created discontent&quot;. The unfamiliar food, American-style housing, and other limitations were at minimum disliked. Additionally, workers felt the way they were treated inhumanly – being required work through the middle of the day under the tropical sun – often refusing to work out of concern that they would succumb to the heat and humidity of the Amazon Rainforest.

===Revolts===
In 1930, the native workers grew tired of Ford&#x27;s imposed diet in addition to a change with how the food was distributed and revolted in the town&#x27;s cafeteria. This became known as the &quot;Breaking Pans&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Quebra-Panelas&quot;). The rebels proceeded to cut the telegraph wires and chased away the managers and even the town&#x27;s cook into the jungle for a few days until the Brazilian Army arrived and the revolt ended. Agreements were then made on the type of food the workers would be served.

===Ford&#x27;s failure===
A 2009 NPR article reported, &quot;Not one drop of latex from Fordlândia ever made it into a Ford car&quot;. The government of Brazil was suspicious of any foreign investments, particularly in the northern Amazonian region, and offered little help. It was not long before the numerous problems began to take a toll on the project and the decision was made to relocate. Fordlândia was abandoned by the Ford Motor Company in 1934, and the project was relocated downstream to Belterra, south of the city of Santarém, where better conditions to grow rubber existed. By 1945, synthetic rubber had been developed, reducing world demand for natural rubber. Ford&#x27;s investment opportunity dried up overnight without producing any rubber for Ford&#x27;s tires, and the second town was also abandoned. In 1945, Henry Ford&#x27;s grandson Henry Ford II sold the area comprising both towns back to the Brazilian government for a loss of over US$20 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

In spite of the huge investment and numerous invitations, Henry Ford never visited either of his ill-fated towns.

===Ministry of Agriculture===

Between the 1950s and late 1970s, after being given back the rights to the lands, the Brazilian government, through its Ministry of Agriculture, installed several facilities in the area. The houses that once belonged to Ford&#x27;s rubber tappers were then given to the families of the Ministry&#x27;s employees, whose descendants still occupy them.

This project was also short-lived and left the city nearly completely abandoned upon reaching its end.

==Rebirth==
The town remained inhabited by roughly 90 people until the latter half of the 2000s. No basic services were offered in the area, with medical help only coming by boat at long intervals. That changed when people looking for places to live decided to go back into the town, often claiming houses. The town, now a district of Aveiro, was home to nearly 3,000 people .

==Facilities==

Most of the original buildings still stand, with the exception of the hospital, which was dismantled by looters.

===Water tower===
Regarded as the symbol of Fordlândia, the tall water tower is located by the main warehouses. As with most of the equipment in the town, it was built in Michigan and brought to Fordlândia by merchant ship. The water tower, water treatment plant and all of its original plumbing are still operational.

===Hospital===

The hospital was left intact until the late 2000s, when looters completely dismantled the hospital and removed its contents.

Before being dismantled, a number of controversies occurred regarding the hospital&#x27;s X-ray machines. As a local TV station reported, several marked boxes containing radioactive material were left behind. This generated fears of contamination among the population of nearby towns and cities, with people often mentioning the Goiânia accident, causing the authorities to remove the materials following an outcry.

===Sawmill===
The town had a sawmill responsible for providing lumber for all the construction around. The sawmill and kiln still stand; however, most equipment is gone.

===Workshop===
The town&#x27;s workshop was a three-story warehouse responsible for manufacturing parts for the machines working in the town. It still stands and has most of the original equipment. It is now used as a warehouse where most artifacts from Ford&#x27;s era are kept. Hospital beds, equipment, a lead coffin and parts of an X-ray machine are stored in this warehouse.

The second floor of the warehouse was allowed to be used for the processing of seeds for a community project. The oil extracted from those seeds greatly accelerated the rotting of the wooden floor which has collapsed in some areas.

===American Village===
The six houses in the American Village still had their original furniture, silverware and even clothes that were left behind when the town was deserted. The houses were claimed by locals and most items were sold or taken as souvenirs. One of the houses was lost to a fire.

<text>Aass Brewery (Norwegian: &quot;Aass Bryggeri&quot;) is Norway&#x27;s oldest brewery still active. Founded in 1834 in Drammen, Norway, the brewery&#x27;s primary products are beer and aquavit. The company also produces a wide range of soft drinks. Aass was also co-owner of the Norwegian soda pop brand A/S Solo.

==History==
Originally a company dealing in timber, groceries, baking and brewing, the brewery was bought by farmer&#x27;s son Poul Lauritz Aass in the 1860s. The brewery is still owned by the Aass family, which makes it one of Norway&#x27;s few remaining independent breweries. As an independent, it has built up a reputation for high quality products and tasty beers, brewing strictly according to the German Purity Law (reinheitsgebot).

Drammensølets venner (the Friends of the Beer from Drammen) is an association that supports the brewery, arranging various events and publishing a newsletter about 4 times a year. It is the world&#x27;s 2nd largest such association, currently boasting about 35,000 members.

==Beers==
Juleøl (strong seasonal Christmas beer), Pilsner, Fatøl, Classic (amber), Pale Ale, Bock Beer, Gull and a dark Munich-style lager called Aass Bayer. And many more.

<text>In mathematics, the Stoneham numbers are a certain class of real numbers, named after mathematician Richard G. Stoneham (1920–1996). For coprime numbers &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1, the Stoneham number α&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot; is defined as

:formula_1

It was shown by Stoneham in 1973 that α&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot; is &quot;b&quot;-normal whenever &quot;c&quot; is an odd prime and &quot;b&quot; is a primitive root of &quot;c&quot;2. In 2002, Bailey &amp; Crandall showed that coprimality of &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1 is sufficient for &quot;b&quot;-normality of α&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;.

<text>Fly or Die is the second studio album by American rap rock band N.E.R.D. It was released on March 23, 2004.

==Production==
The band recorded its second album &quot;Fly or Die&quot; during 2003. The band actually learned the instruments needed to play the tunes, so they could perform live. As Chad Hugo told MTV News on December 8, 2003, &quot;We&#x27;re the ones playing the instruments live this time. I just started playing guitar last year so I&#x27;m learning as we go. Pharrell&#x27;s playing drums. Last time, (on &quot;In Search of...&quot;) we didn&#x27;t have time to learn certain instruments so we got Spymob to help us out.&quot;

The band also recruited some assistance to record the album with Lenny Kravitz and Questlove playing on the track &quot;Maybe.&quot; Several of tracks concern issues of particular concern to adolescents including &quot;Thrasher&quot; about bullies, &quot;Drill Sergeant&quot; about rebellion and conscription, and first love on &quot;Backseat Love&quot;. Considered an eclectic album of art rock, &quot;Fly or Die&quot; features songs that have been compared to XTC and 10cc.

==Reception==

&quot;Fly or Die&quot; went on sale on March 23, 2004. The lead single &quot;She Wants to Move&quot; went into the Top 5 in U.K, top 10 in New Zealand, top 20 in Norway, Italy, Ireland and Denmark and top 40 in Australia and the Netherlands as of March 2004. &quot;Fly or Die&quot; sold 412,000 copies in the United States, but shipped at least 500,000 units making it qualify for RIAA&#x27;s Gold Certification.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (4/15/04, p. 147) - 3 stars out of 5 - &quot;It&#x27;s fascinating to hear these rap geniuses go undercover as a bar band you might hear rocking Journey covers in a bowling alley.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (4/2/04, p. 62) - &quot;Fly or Die is craftier and more multilayered than its predecessor...[A] set of clever, complex, studio-crafted pop--complete with musicianly, smooth-jazz licks--that doesn&#x27;t owe allegiance to any one genre.&quot; - Rating: A-

&quot;Uncut&quot; (p. 91) - 5 stars out of 5 - &quot;N*E*R*D can replicate machine hypersyncopation at the drop of a hi-hat. Prog-pop album of year.&quot;

&quot;Uncut&quot; (p. 74) - Ranked #18 in Uncut&#x27;s &quot;Best Albums of 2004&quot; - &quot;[A]n object lesson in eclectic art-rock...[T]his prog-pop classic reveal further depths of detail with every repeated play.&quot;

&quot;Mojo&quot; (p. 106) - 4 stars out of 5 - &quot;This is an enthusiastic hymn to the terminally uncool, an un-ironic celebration of nerd-culture...They make a party you want to be invited to.&quot;

It was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>The European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies (ENCOD), originally European NGO Council On Drugs and development, is a network of European non-governmental organisations and citizens concerned with the impact of current international drug policies on the lives of the most affected sectors in Europe and the Global South.
Since 1994 they have been working to advocate more just and effective drugs control policies, which include an integrated solution for all problems related to the global drugs phenomenon.

==History==
ENCOD was set up in 1993 thanks to the support of the European Commission, as an NGO counterpart to the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction. However, the Management Board of the EMCDDA later decided to ignore any NGO involvement in the work of the EMCDDA.

In 1998 a Manifesto for just and effective drug policies was redacted by 14 NGOs from Europe, Africa and South America, then signed by hundreds of organizations, companies, political parties, and citizens.

ENCOD is a self-financed and independent network, legally based in Belgium, and is steered by a Committee composed citizens from different EU countries (5 people after the 2013 General assembly).

==Mission==
The organization declares three primary objectives:
* To improve understanding of the causes and effects of the drugs trade,
* To contribute to the elaboration of just and effective drugs control policies,
* To bring about greater consistency between drugs control efforts and economic and social policies.

ENCOD is implementing these objectives in three ways:
* it facilitates coordination, information exchange and joint analysis between its members,
* it carries out joint information campaigns, aimed at the general public,
* it carries out joint advocacy activities, aimed at policy-makers and the media.

==Activities==

<text> (, literally &quot;Mouth of the Warnow&quot;) is a seaside resort and a district of the city of Rostock in Mecklenburg, Germany. It is located on the Baltic Sea and, as the name implies, at the estuary of the river Warnow. is one of the world&#x27;s busiest cruise ports.

== History ==

Founded in about 1200, was for centuries a small fishing village with minor importance for the economic and cultural development of the region. In 1323 lost its autonomous status as it was purchased by the city of Rostock in order to safeguard the city&#x27;s access to the Baltic Sea. It was not until the 19th century that began to develop into an important seaside resort. Today has approximately 8,400 inhabitants.

== Economy ==

Once completely dependent on the fishing industry, &#x27;s economic alignment has shifted inevitably from the primary to the secondary and tertiary sector. Besides the Nordic Yards Warnemünde ship yard (the former ), the economy largely depends on tourism. The construction of a modern cruise line centre in 2005 has contributed crucially to &#x27;s establishment as the most important harbour for cruise line ships in Germany.

 was formerly the site of the original LFG aircraft factories during World War I. Prior to World War II a number of other companies, mostly related in some way to the now bankrupt LFG, started operations in the area. These included and . The factories and surrounding living areas were bombed several times during the war. Many of these factories were used to form .

== Sights ==

Being a centre of maritime traffic, the district of comprises numerous navigational aids, the oldest being the lighthouse, built in 1897, and still currently in use. In the summer, the tower, approximately high, allows visitors to enjoy an impressive view over the Baltic Sea and the northern districts of Rostock. Warnemünde&#x27;s other famous landmark, the nearby (&quot;Teapot&quot; in German) with its curved roof, is an interesting living example of East German architecture. Built in and opened for the first time in 1926, it burned down at the end of World War II. Rebuilt in the 1960s with a curved roof and renovated in 2002, it today houses various restaurants.

In the vicinity of the canal called &#x27; (Old Channel), with its various restaurants, pubs and traditional fishing boats, regional specialities are offered in a fish market. Edvard Munch House, where the Norwegian painter of &quot;The Scream&quot; lived from 1907 to 1908, is at &#x27;. The Warnemünde Church was built on the western edge of the town in 1866 and consecrated in 1871.

&#x27;s large, sandy beaches are the broadest on the German Baltic Sea coast and stretch out over a length of .

There is a simple 1:1 billion scale model of the Solar System, the &#x27;, with a 1.4m diameter sphere as a model of the Sun installed near the light house, and signs with true scale depictions of the planets at the appropriate distances of their orbits along a coastal walking trail westwards. Some of these signs are over a kilometre apart, and the total length of the &#x27; is close to 6 km (5,870m). The model includes Pluto and has not been updated since Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Walking along the &quot;&quot; allows hikers to get an intuitive idea of the relative distances between the orbits of the planets and the Sun.

<text>Erowid, also called Erowid Center, is a non-profit educational organization that provides information about psychoactive plants and chemicals.

Erowid documents legal and illegal substances, including their intended and adverse effects. Information on Erowid&#x27;s website is gathered from diverse sources including published literature, experts in related fields, and the experiences of the general public. Erowid acts as a publisher of new information as well as a library for the collection of documents and images published elsewhere.

== History ==
Erowid was founded in April 1995 as a small business; their website appeared six months later. The name &quot;Erowid&quot; was chosen to reflect the organization&#x27;s stated philosophy of education. Using Proto-Indo-European linguistic roots, &quot;Erowid&quot; roughly translates into &quot;Earth Wisdom&quot; (, ).

In 2005, the 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization, &quot;Erowid Center&quot;, was formed. The organization is supported by donations, and its website is free of advertisements. Although its primary focus is on the website, Erowid Center also provides research and data for other harm reduction, health, and educational organizations. The organization is based in Northern California.

Fire Erowid and Earth Erowid are the sobriquets of the two creators of the site. Both work full-time on the project, along with speaking at conferences, producing original research, and contributing to entheogenic research. According to the site, the creators&#x27; vision includes a &quot;world where people treat psychoactives with respect and awareness; where people work together to collect and share knowledge in ways that strengthen their understanding of themselves, and provide insight into the complex choices faced by individuals and societies alike.&quot;

Erowid Center&#x27;s mission is to provide and facilitate access to objective, accurate, and non-judgmental information about psychoactive plants, chemicals, technologies, and related issues. According to one study, &quot;Erowid is a trusted resource for drug information—both positive and negative,&quot; and Erowid has been extensively cited worldwide by book authors, scientific and medical journals, newspapers, magazines, filmmakers, radio and TV shows, Ph.D. students, web sites, and other media producers.

== Projects ==

=== Online library ===
The library contains over 63,000 documents related to over 737 psychoactive substances, including images, research summaries and abstracts, FAQs, media articles, experience reports, information on chemistry, dosage, effects, law, health, traditional and spiritual use, and drug testing. , over 17 million people visit the site each year.

The site generally contains more detail in the pages listed under plants and chemicals than in other sections. It does not have comprehensive information about the specific effects of most pharmaceuticals. Such information may appear elsewhere on the site, where one can read about people&#x27;s individual reactions to various drugs.

=== Experience Vaults ===
Erowid allows site visitors to submit descriptions of their own personal experiences with psychoactive substances for review and possible publication. The site states that they welcome all perspectives regarding personal psychoactive experience, including positive, negative, and neutral. Their collection consists of more than 30,000 edited, reviewed, and published reports, as well as stating that they have another 55,000 unpublished reports undergoing review. Many of their reports are collected from Bluelight.org, and the two organizations have collaborated to categorize and publish trip reports.

=== DrugsData / EcstasyData ===
Erowid also runs DrugsData (formerly EcstasyData), an independent laboratory drug checking program co-sponsored by IsomerDesign and DanceSafe.

Launched in July 2001 under the name EcstasyData, its purpose was to collect ecstasy pill samples sent anonymously by the public, in order to manage, review, and publicly report laboratory test results from a variety of organizations As the site evolved into DrugsData, the service expanded to testing samples of most recreational drugs, and publicly report the sample&#x27;s chemical composition as well as what it was sold as.

As of April 10, 2024, DrugsData&#x27;s service is on administrative pause until further notice, by order of the DEA. DrugsData has published test results for over 20,000 samples throughout its 23 years of service.

Testing costs have sometimes been covered by project funding (when available) and at other times are covered by those who submit tablets for testing. Multiple published studies use EcstasyData.org as a primary source of data.

Tablets of street ecstasy can be anonymously submitted to a DEA licensed laboratory for testing and then photos of the tablets and GC/MS test results are published on the project&#x27;s website.

=== Erowid Extracts ===
&quot;Erowid Extracts&quot;, the bi-annual members&#x27; newsletter of Erowid, has been published each year since 2001. It provides updates on the organization&#x27;s activities, results of surveys conducted on Erowid.org, experience reports, new articles on various aspects of psychedelic and psychoactive plants and drugs, and information about psychedelic culture and events. New issues of &quot;Erowid Extracts&quot; are sent to members, but past issues are available on the Erowid website.

=== Psychoactive Reference Library ===
Erowid and The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) collaborated on two large reference database projects. Erowid has provided expertise and work developing and coordinating the construction of an online psychoactive drug reference library, and MAPS has published a similar collection 

=== Document archiving ===
Erowid Center also archives and provides access to thousands of older texts in their online and physical libraries. By collecting and making these texts available, they attempt to promote an understanding of the changing contexts surrounding the use of psychoactive drugs. Major archiving projects include the Albert Hofmann collection, the Myron Stolaroff Collection, documents from Alexander Shulgin, and a complete archived snapshot of The Hive.

== Reception ==
Due to the subject matter presented on Erowid.org, the site has drawn praise and criticism from both the media and medical officials. Edward Boyer, an emergency-room physician, and toxicologist, while admitting that Erowid has a plethora of useful information, once argued the site may cause more harm than good to potential drug users.

Anthropologist Nicolas Langlitz argued that Erowid also sometimes serves as a mechanism of postmarket surveillance or pharmacovigilance in the realm of illicit and experimental substances.

<doc id="541390" wikidata="Q527012" url="?curid=541390" title="Stanisław Mikołajczyk">
<text>Stanisław Mikołajczyk (18 July 1901 – 13 December 1966; ) was a Polish politician. He was a prime minister of the Polish government-in-exile during World War II, and later Deputy Prime Minister in post-war Poland until 1947.

==Biography==
===Background and early life===
Mikołajczyk&#x27;s family came from Poznań in western Poland, which in the 19th century was part of the German Empire and known as the Province of Posen. He was born in Westphalia in western Germany, where his parents had gone to look for work in the wealthy mining regions, as many Poles—known as Ruhr Poles—did in the 19th century. He returned to Poznań as a boy of ten.

As a teenager, he worked in a sugar beet refinery and was active in Polish patriotic organisations. He was 18 when Poland recovered its independence, and in 1920 he joined the Polish Army and took part in the Polish–Soviet War. He was discharged after being wounded near Warsaw and returned to inherit his father&#x27;s farm near Poznań.

===Early political career===
In the 1920s Mikołajczyk became active in the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; (PSL), and after holding a number of offices in the government of Poznań province, he was elected to the Sejm (the Polish Parliament) in 1929. In 1935 he became Vice-Chairman of the executive committee of the PSL, and in 1937 he became party President. He was an active opponent of the authoritarian regime established in Poland after the death of Józef Piłsudski in 1935.

===World War II===
When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September of 1939, Mikołajczyk was a private in the Polish army, and served in the defence of Warsaw. After the fall of Warsaw he escaped to Hungary, where he was interned. He soon escaped and made his way to Paris via Yugoslavia and Italy. By the end of November, Mikołajczyk had reached France where he was immediately asked to join the Polish government in exile as deputy Chairman of the Polish National Council. In 1941 he was appointed Minister of the Interior and became Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister. In April 1943 the Germans had announced that they had discovered the graves of almost 22,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets at Katyń Wood. The Soviet government said that the Germans had fabricated the discovery. The Allied governments, for diplomatic reasons, formally accepted this, but Mikołajczyk&#x27;s government refused to do so, and Stalin then severed relations with the government in exile.

===Prime Minister in exile===
When Sikorski was killed in a plane crash in July 1943, Mikołajczyk was appointed as his successor. &quot;We do not wish to see only a formal democracy in Poland,&quot; he said in his broadcast to Poland on taking office, &quot;but a social democracy which will put into practice not only political, religious and personal freedom but also social and economic freedom, the Four Freedoms of which Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke so finely. In any case, there is and will be no place in Poland for any kind of totalitarian government in any shape or form.&quot;

However Mikołajczyk faced daunting challenges. It was obvious by this time that the Soviet armed forces, not those of the western Allies, would seize Poland from German occupation, and the Poles feared that Stalin intended both imposing Communism on Poland and annexing Poland&#x27;s eastern territories, which were populated by Ethnic Poles, Ukrainians and Belarusians.

During 1944 the Allied leaders, particularly Winston Churchill, tried to bring about resumption talks between Mikołajczyk and Stalin, but these efforts broke down over several issues. One was the Katyń massacre. Another was Poland&#x27;s postwar borders. Stalin insisted that the eastern territories should remain in Soviet hands. Mikołajczyk also opposed Stalin&#x27;s plan to set up a Communist government in postwar Poland.

As a result, Stalin agreed that there would be a coalition government in the Soviet seized territories of Poland. A Socialist, Edward Osóbka-Morawski, became Prime Minister of the new Provisional Government of National Unity (&quot;Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej&quot; – TRJN), and the Communist leader Władysław Gomułka became one of two Deputy Prime Ministers. Mikołajczyk resigned as Prime Minister of the government in exile to return to Poland and become the other Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture. Many of the Polish exiles opposed this action, believing that this government was a façade for the establishment of Communist rule in Poland. The government in exile maintained its existence, although it no longer had diplomatic recognition as the legal government of Poland.

===Return to Poland===
Following his return, Mikołajczyk immediately set about reviving the PSL, which soon became by far the largest party in Poland. Some have argued he was further aided by the radical land reform pushed through in accordance with the PPR&#x27;s project, because it &#x27;created a new class of small farmers who became a firm political base for the PSL&#x27;. Of course, Poland had been a largely rural society in any case and Mikołajczyk&#x27;s programme was not a conservative smallholder programme. The Communists knew they would never win a free or fair election in Poland, and so they set about preventing one, despite the nominal pledges given by Stalin at the Yalta Conference.

In June 1946 the 3xTAK referendum was held on a number of issues. The PSL decided to oppose the proposal calling for the abolition of the Senate as a test of strength against the Communists: two-thirds of voters supported Mikołajczyk, but the Communist-controlled Interior Ministry issued faked results showing the opposite result. Between then and the January 1947 general elections, the PSL was subjected to ruthless persecution, and hundreds of its candidates were prevented from campaigning.

From 1946 to 1948, military courts sentenced 32,477 people, most of them members of democratic parties for &#x27;crimes against the state&#x27;. Only then the elections were held. In order to be sure that the elections would produce the &#x27;correct&#x27; results, the Polish security apparatus recruited 47% of the members of electoral committees as agents.

The elections produced a parliament with 394 seats for the Communist-controlled &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot; and 28 for the PSL, a result which everyone knew could only be obtained through massive electoral fraud. Indeed, the opposition claimed that it would have won as much as 80 percent of the vote had the election been conducted in a fair manner.

===Later life===

Mikołajczyk, who would have likely become Prime Minister had the election been honest, immediately resigned from the government in protest. Facing arrest, he left the country in October. Winston Churchill, upon seeing him in London, remarked: &quot;I am surprised you made it out alive&quot;. In London, the Polish government in exile regarded him as a traitor for having co-operated with the Communists. He emigrated to the United States, where he died in 1966. In June 2000 his remains were returned for burial in Poland. His papers are in the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.

A film, &quot;The Right to Vote&quot; (&quot;O Prawo Głosu&quot;, 2008, directed by Janusz Petelski), tells the story of Mikołajczyk&#x27;s (played by Adam Ferency) struggle.

<doc id="541404" wikidata="Q1415772" url="?curid=541404" title="Septuagesima">
<text>Septuagesima () is the ninth Sunday before Easter, the third before Ash Wednesday. The term is sometimes applied to the seventy days starting on Septuagesima Sunday and ending on the Saturday after Easter. Alternatively, the term is sometimes applied also to the period sometimes called pre-Lent that begins on this day and ends on Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, when Lent begins. 

The other two Sundays in this period of the liturgical year are called Sexagesima and Quinquagesima, the latter sometimes also called &quot;Shrove Sunday.&quot; The earliest date on which Septuagesima Sunday can occur is January 18 (Easter falling on March 22 in a common year) and the latest is February 22 (Easter falling on April 25 in a leap year).

==Origins of the term==
&quot;Septuagesima&quot; comes from the Latin word for &quot;seventieth.&quot; Likewise, &quot;Sexagesima,&quot; &quot;Quinquagesima,&quot; and &quot;Quadragesima&quot; mean &quot;sixtieth,&quot; &quot;fiftieth,&quot; and &quot;fortieth&quot; respectively. The significance of this naming (according to Andrew Hughes, &quot;Medieval Manuscripts for Mass and Office&quot; [Toronto, 1982], 10) is as follows: &quot;Septuagesima Sunday [is] so called because it falls within seventy days but more than sixty days before Easter. The next Sunday is within sixty, Sexagesima, and the next within fifty, Quinquagesima ... Falling within forty days of Easter (excluding Sundays) the next Sunday is Quadragesima.&quot; Because every Sunday recalls the resurrection of Christ, they are considered &quot;little Easters&quot; and not treated as days of penance. &quot;Quadragesima&quot; serves as the Latin word for the season of Lent, which (not counting Sundays) is forty days long.

Amalarius of Metz would have the name indicate a period of seventy days made up of the nine weeks to Easter plus Easter Week, which would mystically represent the seventy-year Babylonian captivity. He wrote, &quot;for as the Jews were obliged to do penance seventy years, that they might thereby merit to return into the promised land, so Christians sought to regain the grace of God by fasting for seventy days.&quot;

According to the First Council of Orleans, &quot;many pious ecclesiastics and lay persons of the primitive Church used to fast seventy days before Easter, and their fast was called, therefore, Septuagesima, a name which was afterwards retained to distinguish this Sunday from others.&quot;

Septuagesima was also the day on which one could begin a forty-day Lenten fast that excluded from its observance Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

==Devotional and liturgical practices==

The 17-day period beginning on Septuagesima Sunday was intended to be observed as a preparation for the season of Lent, which is itself a period of spiritual preparation (for Easter). In many countries, however, Septuagesima Sunday marked and still marks the traditional start of the carnival season, culminating on Shrove Tuesday, sometimes known as Mardi Gras.

In the pre-1970 Roman Rite liturgy, the &quot;Alleluia&quot; ceases to be said during the liturgy. At first Vespers of Septuagesima Sunday, two alleluias are added to the closing verse of &quot;Benedicamus Domino&quot; and its response, &quot;Deo gratias&quot;, as during the Easter Octave, and, starting at Compline, it is no longer used until Easter. Likewise, violet vestments are worn, except on feasts, from Septuagesima Sunday until Holy Thursday. As during Advent and Lent, the &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Te Deum&quot; are no longer said on Sundays.

The readings at Matins for this week are the first few chapters of Genesis, telling of the creation of the world, of Adam and Eve, the fall of man and resulting expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and the story of Cain and Abel. In the following weeks before and during Lent, the readings continue to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. The Gospel reading for Septuagesima week is the parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16).

==Catholic usage after 1969==
The liturgical books for the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite revised after the Second Vatican Council omit Septuagesima, Sexagesima and Quinquagesima Sundays, which are found in the earlier versions, and treat this period as part of Ordinary Time, so that the use of violet vestments and the omission of &quot;Alleluia&quot; in the liturgy do not begin until Ash Wednesday.

The Ordinariate Use and Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite have retained the Pre-Lenten season and its traditional observances.

==Lutheran usage==
While Lutherans who adopted a three-year lectionary modeled on that of the Roman Catholic Church eliminated the season of Septuagesima and instead observe an extended Epiphanytide, Lutherans who retained the traditional calendar have continued to observe Septuagesima. The following antiphon, drawn from Psalm 137, is traditionally appointed in Lutheran use for the Saturday before Septuagesima:

Hymnum cantate nobis, Alleluia, de canticis Sion, Alleluia, Quomodo cantabimus canticum Domini in terra aliena? Alleluia, septuaginta annos super flumina Babylonis sedimus et flevimus, dum recordaremur Sion, Alleluia, ibi suspendimus organa nostra, Alleluia. Gloria Patri...

Sing us a hymn, Alleluia, one of the songs of Zion, Alleluia, How shall we sing the Lord&#x27;s song in a strange land? Alleluia, seventy years we sat by the rivers of Babylon and wept when we remembered Zion, Alleluia, there we hung our harps, Alleluia. Glory be to the Father...
Beginning at First Vespers of Septuagesima, &quot;Alleluia&quot; is not said again until the Easter Vigil, and the &quot;Gloria&quot; is not said on Sundays.

==Anglican usage==
Most provinces of the Anglican Communion adopted the same change. In the Church of England these Sundays retain their original designations where the Prayer Book Calendar is followed, but in the Common Worship Calendar they have been subsumed into a pre-Lent season of variable length, with anything from zero to five &quot;Sundays before Lent&quot; depending on the date of Easter. Churches in the Episcopal and Continuing Anglican movement that use the 1928 Book of Common Prayer (or the various missals based upon it) also observe Septuagesima.

==Polish National Catholic Church usage==
The Polish National Catholic Church has officially reinstated the Septuagesima, Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima Sundays in 2014 throughout the entire Church. The celebration of this season as a preparation for Holy Lent is now highlighted as a part of the Liturgical Year.

==Eastern usage==
A pre-Lent season also exists in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic liturgical calendar, and is found in the liturgical book known as the &quot;Triódion&quot; (which continues to Easter Even). It is 22 days long because it begins on the Sunday before Septuagesima, but not 24 since the Byzantine Lent commences on a Monday instead of a Wednesday.

The Sunday of the Prodigal Son is Eastern Orthodox equivalent of Western Septuagesima.

== In popular culture ==
In 1894, Oscar Wilde told the actor Charles Brookfield, who had complained about Wilde&#x27;s conducting rehearsals for his play &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; on Christmas Day, &quot;the only festival of the Church I keep is Septuagesima&quot;.

<text>The Free Papua Movement or Free Papua Organization (, OPM) is a name given to a separatist movement that aims to separate West Papua from Indonesia and establish an independent state in the region. The territory is currently divided into six Indonesian provinces of Central Papua, Highland Papua, Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua, also formerly known as Papua, Irian Jaya and West Irian.

The movement consists of three elements: a disparate group of armed units each with limited territorial control with no single commander; several groups in the territory that conduct demonstrations and protests; and a small group of leaders based abroad that raise awareness of issues in the territory whilst striving for international support for independence.

Since its inception, the OPM has attempted diplomatic dialogue, conducted Morning Star flag-raising ceremonies, and undertaken militant actions as part of the Papua conflict. Supporters routinely display the Morning Star flag and other symbols of Papuan unity, such as the national anthem &quot;Hai Tanahku Papua&quot; and a national coat of arms, which had been adopted in the period 1961 until Indonesian administration began in May 1963 under the New York Agreement. Beginning in 2021, the movement is considered as a &quot;Terrorist and Separatist Organisation&quot; () in Indonesia, and its activities have incurred charges of treason and terrorism.

==History==
During World War II, the Netherlands East Indies (later Indonesia) were guided by Sukarno to supply oil for the Japanese war effort and subsequently declared independence as the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945. The Netherlands New Guinea (Western New Guinea, then a part of the Netherlands East Indies) and Australian administered territories of Papua and British New Guinea resisted Japanese control and were allies with the American and Australian forces during the Pacific War.

The pre-war relationship of the Netherlands and its New Guinea colony was replaced with the promotion of Papuan civil and other services until Indonesian administration began in 1963. Though there was agreement between Australia and the Netherlands by 1957 that it would be preferable for their territories to unite for independence, the lack of development in the Australian territories and the interests of the United States kept the two regions separate. The OPM was founded in December 1963, with the announcement that &quot;We do not want modern life! We refuse any kinds of development: religious groups, aid agencies, and governmental organizations just Leave Us Alone!&quot; Originally the group was a nonviolent spiritual movement based in cargoism and was led by Aser Demotekay, former head of Demta District. His policy of nonviolence and cooperation with Indonesian government, led to the creation of a more radical splinter group under Jacob Prai, former student of Demotekay.

Netherlands New Guinea held elections in January 1961 and a New Guinea Council was inaugurated in April 1961. However, in Washington, D.C. there was a desire for Indonesia to release CIA pilot Allen Pope, and there was a proposal for United Nations trusteeship of West New Guinea, Indonesian President Sukarno said he was willing &#x27;to borrow the hand of the United Nations to transfer the territory to Indonesia&#x27;, and the National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy began to lobby U.S. President John F. Kennedy to get the administration of West New Guinea transferred to Indonesia. The resulting New York Agreement was drafted by Robert Kennedy and signed by the Netherlands and Indonesia before being approved subject to the &quot;Charter of the United Nations&quot; article 85 in &quot;General Assembly resolution 1752&quot; on 21 September 1962.

Although the Netherlands had insisted the West New Guinea people be allowed self-determination in accord with the United Nations charter and General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV) which was to be called the &quot;Act of Free Choice&quot;; the New York Agreement instead provided a seven year delay and gave the United Nations no authority to supervise the act. Separatist groups raise the West Papua Morning Star flag each year on 1 December, which they call &quot;Papuan independence day&quot;. An Indonesian police officer speculated that people doing this could be charged with the crime of treason, which carries the penalty of imprisonment for seven to twenty years in Indonesia.

In October 1968, Nicolaas Jouwe, member of the New Guinea Council and of the National Committee elected by the Council in 1962, lobbied the United Nations claiming 30,000 Indonesian troops and thousands of Indonesian civil servants were repressing the Papuan population. According to US Ambassador Galbraith, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik also believed the Indonesian military was the cause of problems in the territory and the number of troops should be reduced by at least one half. Ambassador Galbraith further described the OPM to &quot;represent an amorphous mass of anti-Indonesia sentiment&quot; and that &quot;possibly 85 to 90 percent [of Papuans], are in sympathy with the Free Papua cause or at least intensely dislike Indonesians&quot;.

Indonesian Brigadier General Sarwo Edhie oversaw the design and conduct of the Act of Free Choice which took place from 14 July to 2 August 1969. The United Nations representative Ambassador Oritiz Sanz arrived on 22 August 1968 and made repeated requests for Indonesia to allow a one man, one vote system (a process known as a referendum or plebiscite) but these requests were refused on the grounds that such activity was not specified nor requested by the 1962 New York Agreement. One thousand and twenty five Papuan elders were selected from and instructed on the required procedure as specified by the article 1962 New York Agreement. The result was a consensus for integration into Indonesia.

=== Republic of West Papua Declaration ===

In response, Nicolaas Jouwe and two OPM commanders, Seth Jafeth Roemkorem and Jacob Hendrik Prai, planned to announce Papuan Independence in 1971. On 1 July 1971 Roemkorem and Prai declared a &quot;Republic of West Papua&quot;, and drafted a constitution in &#x27;Victoria Headquarters&#x27;.

Conflicts over strategy and suspicion between Roemkorem and Prai soon initiated a split of the OPM into two factions; Prai left in March 1976 and by December founded &#x27;Defender of Truth&#x27;, and TPN led by Roemkorem in &#x27;Victoria Headquarters&#x27;. This greatly weakened OPM&#x27;s ability as a centralized combat force. It remains widely used, however, invoked by both contemporary fighters and domestic and expatriate political activists.

== Activities ==

=== 1970s ===
Starting from 1976, officials at mining company Freeport Indonesia received letters from the OPM threatening the company and demanding assistance in a planned uprising in the spring. The company refused to cooperate with OPM. From July until 7 September 1977, OPM insurgents carried out their threats against Freeport and cut slurry and fuel pipelines, slashed telephone and power cables, burned down a warehouse, and detonated explosives at various facilities. Freeport estimated the damage at $US123,871.23.

=== 1980s ===
In 1982 a OPM Revolutionary Council (OPMRC) was established, and under the chairmanship of Moses Werror the OPMRC has sought independence through a campaign of international diplomacy. OPMRC aims to obtain international recognition for West Papuan independence through international forums such as the United Nations, The Non-Aligned Movement of Nations, The South Pacific Forum and The Association of South East Asian Nations.

In 1984 OPM staged an attack on Jayapura, the provincial capital and a city dominated by non-Melanesian Indonesians. The attack was quickly repelled by the Indonesian military, who followed it with broader counter-insurgency activity. This triggered an exodus of Papuan refugees, apparently supported by the OPM, into camps across the border in Papua New Guinea.

On 14 February 1986, Freeport Indonesia received information that the OPM was again becoming active in their area, and that some of Freeport&#x27;s employees were OPM members or sympathisers. On 18 February, a letter signed by a &quot;Rebel General&quot; warned that &quot;On Wed. 19th, there will be some rain on Tembagapura&quot;. At around 22:00 that night several unidentified people cut Freeport&#x27;s slurry and fuel pipelines by hacksaw, causing &quot;a substantial loss of slurry, containing copper, silver and gold ores and diesel fuel.&quot; Additionally, the saboteurs set fire along the breaks in the fuel line, and shot at police that tried to approach the fires. On 14 April of that same year, OPM insurgents cut more pipelines, slashed electric wires, vandalised plumbing, and burned equipment tyres. Repair crews were attacked by OPM gunfire as they approached the sites of the damage, so Freeport requested police and military assistance.

=== 1990s ===

In separate incidents in January and August 1996, OPM captured European and Indonesian hostages; first from a research group and later from a logging camp. Two hostages from the former group were killed and the rest were released..

In July 1998, the OPM raised their independence flag at the Kota Biak water tower on the island of Biak. They stayed there for the following few days before the Indonesian Military broke up the group. Filep Karma was among those arrested.

=== 2000 to 2019 ===
In 2009, an OPM command group led by Goliath Tabuni in Puncak Jaya Regency was featured on an undercover report about the West Papuan independence movement.

On 24 October 2011, Adj. Comr. Dominggus Oktavianus Awes, the Mulia Police chief, was shot by unknown assailants at Mulia Airport in Puncak Jaya regency. The National Police of Indonesia alleged that the perpetrators were members of the Free Papua Movement (OPM) separatist group. The series of attacks prompted deployments of more personnel to Papua.

On 21 January 2012, armed men, believed to be members of OPM, shot and killed a civilian who was running a roadside kiosk. He was a transmigrant from West Sumatra.

On 8 January 2012, OPM conducted an attack on a public bus which caused the death of three civilians and one member of an Indonesian security force. Four others were also injured.
On 31 January 2012, an OPM member was caught carrying of drugs on the Indonesian – Papua New Guinea Border. It was alleged that the drugs were intended to be sold in the city of Jayapura.

On 8 April 2012, Indonesian media sources alleged that armed members of OPM carried out an attack on a civilian aircraft flown by Trigana Air on a scheduled service after it landed and was taxiing towards an apron at Mulia Airport on Puncak Jaya, Papua. Five armed OPM militants suddenly opened fire on the moving plane, causing it to go out of control and crash into a building. One person who died, Leiron Kogoya, a journalist for Papua Pos, had suffered a neck gunshot wound. Amongst those wounded were the pilot, Beby Astek, and co-pilot, Willy Resubun, both wounded by shrapnel; Yanti Korwa, a housewife who was hurt by shrapnel on her right arm, and her four-year-old infant, Pako Korwa, who was afflicted by shrapnel on his left hand. In response to the allegations, West Papuan media source denied that the OPM was responsible for the attack, alleging that the Indonesian military had attacked the plane as a part of a false flag operation.

In December 2012, an Australian would-be mercenary, who was trained by a military/police security firm in Ukraine, was arrested in Australia for planning to train the OPM. He later pleaded guilty to training in the use of arms or explosives with the intention of committing an offence against the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978.

On 26 April 2018, a Polish OPM sympathizer and a far-right nationalist was arrested in Wamena along with four Papuans who police described as linked to &quot;armed criminal groups&quot; and was charged with treason. He later sentenced five year in prison.

On 1 December 2018, an armed group with ties to OPM kidnapped 25 civilian construction workers in Nduga regency, Papua. The following day, the group killed 19 of the workers and a soldier. One of construction workers had allegedly photographed the group raising the Morning Star flag at an independence celebration - considered illegal acts by Indonesian authorities. The construction workers were building a part of the Trans Papua highway that aims to connect remote communities in Papua. A few days after the incident, the OPM allegedly sent an open letter to Indonesian president Joko Widodo, demanding Papuan independence, rejecting central government infrastructure building projects, and demanding the right for foreign journalists and aid workers to enter Papua. In reprisals to obtain the massacred workers&#x27; bodies, the Indonesian military allegedly carried out airstrikes on at least four villages and used white phosphorus, a chemical weapon banned by numerous countries and international organizations. This was however denied by the Indonesian government.

=== 2019 Papuan protests ===
Fresh protests began on 19 August 2019 and mainly took place across Indonesian Papua in response to the arrests of 43 Papuan students in Surabaya, East Java for alleged disrespect of the Indonesian flag. Many of the protests involved thousands of participants, and some grew from local protests in Surabaya to demanding an independence referendum. In several locations, the protests turned into general riots, resulting in the destruction of government buildings in Wamena, Sorong and Jayapura. Clashes between protesters and counter-protesters and police resulted in injuries, with over 31 people killed from both the clashes and the rioting, mostly non-Papuan trapped when rioters burned houses.

In response to the rioting, the government of Indonesia implemented an internet blackout in the region. A Reuters reporter from the Jakarta bureau described the unrest as &quot;Papua&#x27;s most serious in years&quot;.

=== 2020–present ===
On 25 April 2021, Special Forces major-general I Gusti Putu Danny Karya Nugraha, head of the Papua intelligence agency, was killed when he was shot in the head while in an ambush in a heavily-armed military convoy.

On 5 March 2022, Sebby Sambom, a TPNPB-OPM spokesperson, alongside Terianus Satto supported the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, claiming alleged similarity of Ukrainian police and military treatment of the Russian minority as &quot;genocide&quot; with Indonesian police and military treatment of Papuans. TPNPB-OPM claimed Russian government support of pro-Russian separatists as justified, and claimed that both Indonesia and Ukraine are &quot;capitalist puppets&quot; of the United States.

On 7 February 2023, Papuan separatists attacked and set fire to a plane, after taking the pilot and five passengers hostage. The passengers were soon released. The New Zealander pilot, Philip Mehrtens, remained in captivity until 21 September 2024. The flight was operated by Indonesian airline Susi Air that operates flights in and out of Papua. The TPNPB has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and attack, stating that they would be targeting all foreigners as a part of their campaign. On 15 February, photos of the pilot showed him to be in relatively good health and guarded by armed insurgents from the Papua movement. The group said that he would not be freed from captivity until authorities recognise the independence of the region. In June 2024, it was reported that the rebels wanted to free Mehrtens, but there had been &quot;complications&quot; including a failed rescue in April which left casualties on both sides. On 21 September 2024, Mehrtens was freed.

On 3 April 2023, four Indonesian soldiers died and another five suffered gunshot injuries in an attack led by Egianus Kogoya in Nduga, Papua.

==Armed wing==
The Free Papua Movement has many armed wings, namely:
* West Papua National Liberation Army
(; abbreviated TPNPB) (TPNPB-OPM) led by Goliath Tabuni.
* West Papua Army 
(; abbreviated WPA) led by Damianus Magai Yogi.
* West Papua Revolutionary Army
(; abbreviated TRWP) led by Mathias Wenda.
* West Papua National Army
(; abbreviated TNPB) led by Fernando Worobay.

==Organisational hierarchy and governing authority==

The internal organisation of OPM is difficult to determine. In 1996 OPM&#x27;s &#x27;Supreme Commander&#x27; was Mathias Wenda. An OPM spokesperson in Sydney, John Otto Ondawame, says it has nine more or less independent commands. Australian freelance journalist Ben Bohane says it has seven independent commands. Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI), Indonesia&#x27;s army, says the OPM has two main wings, the &#x27;Victoria Headquarters&#x27; and &#x27;Defenders of Truth&#x27;. The former is small, and was led by M L Prawar until he was shot dead in 1991. The latter is much larger and operates all over West Papua.

The larger organisation, or &#x27;Defender of the Truth&#x27; or Pembela Kebenaran (henceforth PEMKA), was chaired by Jacob Prai, and Seth Roemkorem was the leader of Victoria Faction. During the killing of Prawar, Roemkorem was his commander.

Prior to this separation, TPN/OPM was one, under the leadership of Seth Roemkorem as the Commander of OPM, then the President of West Papua Provisional Government, while Jacob Prai as the Head of Senate. OPM reached its peak in organisation and management as it was structurally well organised. During this time, the Senegal Government recognised the presence of OPM and allowed OPM to open its embassy in Dakar, with Tanggahma as the ambassador.

Due to the rivalry, Roemkorem left his base and went to the Netherlands. During this time, Prai took over the leadership. John Otto Ondawame, who had left his law school in Jayapura because of being followed and threatened with death by the Indonesian ABRI day and night, became the right-hand man of Jacob Prai. It was Prai&#x27;s initiative to establish OPM Regional Commanders. He appointed nine of them, most of whom were members of his own troops at the PEMKA headquarter, Skotiau, Vanimo-West Papua border.

Of those regional commanders, Mathias Wenda was the commander for region II (Jayapura – Wamena), Kelly Kwalik for Nemangkawi (Fakfak regency), Tadeus Yogi (Paniai Regency), and Bernardus Mawen for Maroke region. Tadeus Yogi died on 9 January 2009 suspected of poisoning, Kelly Kwalik was shot and killed on 16 December 2009, while Benard Mawen died in Kiunga hospital, PNG on 16 November 2018. 

The armed military wing of TPNPB in Nduga, Papua is headed by Egianus Kogoya.

<doc id="541421" wikidata="Q230832" url="?curid=541421" title="Peggy Ashcroft">
<text>Dame Edith Margaret Emily &quot;Peggy&quot; Ashcroft (22 December 1907 – 14 June 1991) was an English actress whose career spanned more than 60 years. 

Born to a comfortable middle-class family, Ashcroft was determined from an early age to become an actress, despite parental opposition. She was working in smaller theatres even before graduating from drama school, and within two years she was starring in the West End. Ashcroft maintained her leading place in British theatre for the next 50 years. Always attracted by the ideals of permanent theatrical ensembles, she did much of her work for the Old Vic in the early 1930s, John Gielgud&#x27;s companies in the 1930s and 1940s, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and its successor the Royal Shakespeare Company from the 1950s, and the National Theatre from the 1970s.

While well regarded in Shakespeare, Ashcroft was also known for her commitment to modern drama, appearing in plays by Bertolt Brecht, Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. Her career was almost wholly spent in the live theatre until the 1980s. She then turned to television and cinema with considerable success, winning three BAFTAs, one Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award, and received nominations for an additional Golden Globe Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Ashcroft was born in Croydon, Surrey, (now in Greater London) the younger child and only daughter of Violetta Maud, &quot;née&quot; Bernheim (1874–1926) and William Worsley Ashcroft (1878–1918), a land agent. According to Michael Billington, her biographer, Violetta Ashcroft was of Danish and German Jewish descent and a keen amateur actress. Ashcroft&#x27;s father was killed on active service in the First World War. She attended Woodford School, East Croydon, where one of her teachers encouraged her love of Shakespeare, but neither her teachers nor her mother approved of her desire to become a professional actress. Ashcroft was determined, however, and at the age of 16, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama, run by Elsie Fogerty, from whom her mother had taken lessons some years before. The school&#x27;s emphasis was on the voice and elegant diction, which did not appeal to Ashcroft or to her fellow pupil Laurence Olivier. She learned more from reading &quot;My Life in Art&quot; by Constantin Stanislavski, the influential director of the Moscow Art Theatre.
While still a student, Ashcroft made her professional stage debut at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in a revival of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; opposite Ralph Richardson, with whom she had been greatly impressed when she saw him in Charles Doran&#x27;s touring company while she was still a schoolgirl. She graduated from the Central School in 1927 with London University&#x27;s Diploma in Dramatic Art. Never much drawn to the West End or stardom, she learned her craft with mostly small companies in fringe theatres. Her first notable West End role was Naemi in &quot;Jew Süss&quot; in 1929, an extravagantly theatrical production, in which she won praise for the naturalism and truth of her playing. In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor and later a publisher. He later described the marriage as &quot;a sad failure: we were much too young to know what we wanted ... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced. Nowadays Peggy and I lunch together perhaps once or twice a year in a Soho restaurant and have a lovely nostalgic-romantic talk of shared memories of long ago. She is a lovely person and the best actress living.&quot;

===1930s===
In 1930 Ashcroft was cast as Desdemona in a production of &quot;Othello&quot; at the Savoy Theatre, starring Paul Robeson in the title role. The production was not well received, but Ashcroft&#x27;s notices were excellent. The production prompted a political awakening in Ashcroft, who was astonished to receive hate mail for appearing onstage with a black actor; she was angry that Robeson was not welcome at the Savoy Hotel, despite being the star at the adjoining Savoy Theatre. During the run she had a brief affair with Robeson, which brought Robeson&#x27;s marriage to Essie Robeson to an end. Their affair, followed by another with the writer J. B. Priestley, ended Ashcroft&#x27;s first marriage. Hart-Davis was granted a divorce in 1933, on the grounds of Ashcroft&#x27;s adultery with the director Theodore Komisarjevsky.

Among those impressed by Ashcroft&#x27;s performance as Desdemona was John Gielgud, recently established as a West End star. He recalled, &quot;When Peggy came on in the Senate scene it was as if all the lights in the theatre had suddenly gone up&quot;. In 1932 he was invited by the Oxford University Dramatic Society to try his hand at directing, in the society&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the nurse won golden notices, although their director, already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue, referred to them as &quot;Two leading ladies, the like of whom I hope I shall never meet again.&quot;
Ashcroft joined the Old Vic company for the 1932–33 season. The theatre, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers modest wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivaled repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and many West End stars took a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Sheridan Morley&#x27;s words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas. During the season Ashcroft played five Shakespeare heroines, as well as Kate in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, Mary Stuart in a new play by John Drinkwater, and Lady Teazle in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;. In 1933 she made her first film, &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;. She was not attracted to the medium of cinema and made only four more films over the next quarter-century.

During her professional and personal relationship with Komisarjevsky, whom she married in 1934 and left in 1936, Ashcroft learned from him what Billington calls &quot;the vital importance of discipline, perfectionism, and the idea that the actor, even during passages of emotional stress, must remain a thinking human being&quot;.

After appearing in the Hitchcock film &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935), and a succession of stage failures, Ashcroft was once again cast as Juliet by Gielgud, this time in a West End production that attracted enormous attention. It ran from October 1935 to March 1936, and Ashcroft&#x27;s Romeos were played in alternation by Olivier and Gielgud. Critical opinions differed as to the relative merits of her leading men, but Ashcroft won glowing reviews. In May 1936 Komisarjevsky directed a production of &quot;The Seagull&quot;, with Evans as Arkadina, Gielgud as Trigorin and Ashcroft as Nina. The recent collapse of her marriage to the director made rehearsals difficult, but the critical reception was ecstatic.

After playing briefly and without much pleasure in New York, Ashcroft returned to London in 1937 for a season of four plays presented by Gielgud at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre. She played the Queen in &quot;Richard II&quot;, Lady Teazle in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, Irina in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. The company included Harry Andrews, Glen Byam Shaw, George Devine, Michael Redgrave and Harcourt Williams, with Angela Baddeley and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as guests. The directors were Gielgud himself, Tyrone Guthrie and Michel Saint-Denis. Billington considers that this company laid the foundations of post-war ensembles such as the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. The Munich crisis and the approach of the Second World War delayed for a decade the further development of such a company.

===1940s and 1950s===
In 1940. Ashcroft met and married the rising lawyer Jeremy Hutchinson. They had a daughter, Eliza, the following year, and Ashcroft did little stage work while the child was young. Her main appearances during the war years were in Gielgud&#x27;s company at the Haymarket Theatre in 1944, playing Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and the title role in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;. She won excellent notices, but the productions were thought to lack flair and were unfavourably compared with the exciting work of the rival Old Vic company under Richardson and Olivier&#x27;s leadership. After the Haymarket season Ashcroft resumed her break from the theatre, first campaigning for her husband, who stood as a Labour candidate in the 1945 general election, and then having a second child, Nicholas, in 1946.

Returning to the stage in 1947, Ashcroft had two long-running successes in a row as the alcoholic Evelyn Holt in &quot;Edward, My Son&quot;, in the West End and then on Broadway, and the downtrodden Catherine Sloper in &quot;The Heiress&quot; in 1949.
Ashcroft began the 1950s with a return to Shakespeare, at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, playing Beatrice to Gielgud&#x27;s Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Cordelia to his King Lear. In 1951 she returned to the Old Vic, playing Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, the title role in &quot;Electra&quot; and Mistress Page in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. In the second of these, according to Billington, &quot;she scaled the austere peaks of Greek tragedy&quot;.

Through the rest of the decade, Ashcroft&#x27;s career switched between commercial productions in the West End and appearances in the nascent subsidised theatres in Shakespeare and experimental works. In the former she made a deep impression as the adulterous, suicidal Hester Collyer in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1952) and was well reviewed as the governess Miss Madrigal in Enid Bagnold&#x27;s &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1956). Her roles for non-commercial managements were in Shakespeare at Stratford and on tour, Hedda Gabler (1954) and the double role of Shen Te and Shui Ta in &quot;The Good Woman of Setzuan&quot; (1956). The last of these was not a success, but Ashcroft was credited with courage for taking the role on.

In 1958, Peter Hall, who had been appointed to run the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, approached Ashcroft with his plans for a permanent company, with bases in Stratford and London, and a regular, salaried company, presenting a mixture of classical and new plays. Ashcroft immediately agreed to join him, and her lead was, in Hall&#x27;s view, key to the success of the new Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC).

===1960s===

In the RSC&#x27;s first seasons Ashcroft played Katharina in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Paulina in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1960), The Duchess of Malfi (1961), Emilia in &quot;Othello&quot; (1961) and Ranevskaya in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, opposite Gielgud as Gaev. These were generally well reviewed, but her performance in &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; in 1963 and 1964 had the critics searching for superlatives. The production was a reshaping of Shakespeare&#x27;s three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays and &quot;Richard III&quot;. Ashcroft, then aged fifty-six, played Margaret of Anjou, ageing from blithe youth to ferocious old age as the plays progressed. The critic Philip Hope-Wallace wrote of:
At about this time Ashcroft&#x27;s third and last marriage was beginning to fall apart. According to Billington she found solace in her work, and threw herself into classical and &quot;avant garde&quot; works &quot;with ever greater fervour&quot;. Her roles in the 1960s were Arkadina in &quot;The Seagull&quot; (1964), Mother in Marguerite Duras&#x27;s &quot;Days in the Trees&quot; (1966), Mrs Alving in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1967), Agnes in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1969), Beth in Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Landscape&quot; (1969) and Katharine of Aragon in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1969).

===Later years===
In the 1970s, Ashcroft remained a pillar of the RSC but when Peter Hall succeeded Olivier as director of the National Theatre in 1973 he persuaded her to appear there from time to time. She also appeared at the Royal Court in Duras&#x27;s &quot;The Lovers of Viorne&quot; (1971) in the role of a schizophrenic killer, a performance that the young Helen Mirren found so accomplished that &quot;I just wanted to rush out and start all over again&quot;. Many were surprised when Ashcroft appeared with Richardson at the Savoy in 1972 in what was by all appearances a conventional West End drawing room comedy, &quot;Lloyd George Knew My Father&quot;, by William Douglas-Home, but the two stars revealed unexpected depths in their characters.

For the National, Ashcroft appeared in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot;, Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; and Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Family Voices&quot;. Her RSC roles were Lidya in Aleksei Arbuzov&#x27;s &quot;Old World&quot; (1976), and her last stage part was the Countess in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, which she played at Stratford in 1981 and in London in 1982.

Ashcroft later made occasional, but highly successful, television and film appearances. For &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot; she won a BAFTA award for best actress in 1984, and for her portrayal of Mrs. Moore in David Lean&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;A Passage to India&quot; she won another BAFTA best actress award and the 1985 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress; this made her the oldest person to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, at 77 years 93 days old. Her final performance was also in a work about India, the radio play &quot;In the Native State&quot; by Tom Stoppard.

She was the grandmother of the French singer Emily Loizeau.

Ashcroft died of a stroke in London at the age of 83. Her ashes were scattered around a mulberry tree in the Great Garden at New Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, which she had planted in 1969. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 30 November 1991.

==Honours, awards and memorials==

Ashcroft&#x27;s British state honours were Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1951 Birthday Honours and Dame Commander of the Order (DBE) in the 1956 Birthday Honours. Her foreign state honours were the King&#x27;s Gold Medal, Norway (1955), and the Order of St Olav, Norway (Commander, 1976). She was awarded honorary degrees by eight universities and was an honorary fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. She was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1989. In addition to the Oscar and BAFTA awards, she received a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a New Play for Old World in 1976, a Venice Film Festival Award for &quot;She&#x27;s Been Away&quot; (1989), a BAFTA Award for the television play &quot;Caught on a Train&quot; (1980), a special award from the British Theatre Association for the television play &quot;Cream in My Coffee&quot; (1982), a special award from BAFTA (1990) and a special Laurence Olivier Award (1991).

Ashcroft is commemorated with a memorial plaque in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey. The Ashcroft Theatre in Croydon was named in her honour in 1962. The Royal Shakespeare Company has an Ashcroft Room directly above the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon named after her, used for play rehearsals.

On 13 June 2024, English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque on Ashcroft&#x27;s birthplace at Tirlemont Road, South Croydon.

<doc id="541426" wikidata="Q4355091" url="?curid=541426" title="HMS Blake (C99)">
<text>HMS &quot;Blake&quot; was a light cruiser of the of the British Royal Navy, the last (traditional) Royal Navy gun-armed cruiser of the 20th century. She was named after Robert Blake, a 17th-century admiral who was the &quot;Father of the Royal Navy&quot;.

== Construction and commissioning ==
She was ordered and laid down in 1942 as one of the of light cruisers. They had a low construction priority due to more pressing requirements for other ship types during World War II, particularly anti-submarine craft. In 1944, she was renamed &quot;Tiger&quot;, then back to &quot;Blake&quot; again in 1945, the year she was launched partially constructed at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Govan, by Lady Jean Blake, wife of Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Blake. Construction was suspended in 1946 and she was laid up at Gareloch.

In 1954, construction of &quot;Blake&quot; resumed, but to a new design. The new design was approved in 1951, but construction did not resume until 1954. She would have fully automatic 6 inch guns in twin high-angle mounts with each gun capable of shooting 20 rounds per minute, and a secondary battery of fully automatic 3 inch guns which delivered 90 rounds per minute per gun. She would have no lighter anti-aircraft armament or torpedo tubes. Air conditioning was fitted throughout the ship, and a 200-line automatic telephone exchange was installed. Each 6 inch and 3 inch mounting had its own director, linked to a dedicated radar on the director. On 18 March 1961, &quot;Blake&quot; finally commissioned into the Royal Navy, to date the last (traditional) cruiser to do so. Just two years later, she was placed in reserve.

== Conversion ==
From 1965 to 1969, she underwent a major conversion to become a helicopter and command cruiser. This reconstruction included replacing the aft 6 inch and 3-inch mounts with a flight deck and hangar. She also had new radars and taller funnels. She had excellent command, control, and communications facilities installed, and found use as a flagship to task groups. The refit was very expensive; during the conversion, a major fire broke out causing considerable damage and raising the costs still further. There were concerns that the money used to convert &quot;Blake&quot; and her sister ship to helicopter cruisers drained much-needed resources better used elsewhere.

==Later career==
In 1969 &quot;Blake&quot; deployed to Gibraltar along with other Royal Navy units in order to ‘fly the flag’ in response to Spanish hostility following the closure of the Gibraltar-Spain border by General Franco. Also in 1969 a Royal Air Force (RAF) Harrier jet landed on &quot;Blake&quot;. In 1971, she was present during the emotional withdrawal from Malta, supporting the commando carrier . In 1977 she took part in the Fleet Review of the Royal Navy during the Silver Jubilee celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II, which took place off Spithead, site of many Fleet Reviews.

The cruiser carried Westland Wessex HAS.3 helicopters of 820 Naval Air Squadron from June 1969; these were replaced by the Westland Sea King HAS.1 helicopter in December 1972, continuing until &quot;Blake&quot; was withdrawn from service in 1979. &quot;Blake&quot; was the last ship to fire a six-inch gun in the Royal Navy. Her large crew made her an expensive ship to operate and maintain.

== Decommissioning ==
&quot;Blake&quot; was refitted in 1980, and due to a defence manpower drawdown that resulted in manpower shortages, became part of the Standby Squadron in HMNB Chatham. The advent of the Falklands War led to a rapid ship survey in early April 1982 and work was immediately begun to recommission her and sister ship &quot;Tiger&quot; for service in the conflict, but work was stopped on both in late May when it was clear neither could be ready in time to be deployed. Chile showed some interest in acquiring both her, and &quot;Tiger&quot; in June–July, but a proposed deal did not go through for the ships, despite both being in good shape and that a good deal of reactivation work had been accomplished the past April–May. She was sold for scrap on 25 August 1982 to Shipbreaking (Queenborough) Ltd for £210,000. She was the last cruiser serving with the Royal Navy upon her decommissioning. She was sold for breaking up in August 1982 and on 29 October 1982, she was towed from Chatham for Cairnryan, near Stranraer in Scotland, arriving 7 November 1982.

The 1961-1963 ship&#x27;s bell of &quot;Blake&quot; has been preserved and was on display in Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, Bridgwater, until 2016. Following the reordering of the church it was transferred to Blake Museum, Bridgwater where it forms part of the display about Robert Blake.

<doc id="541428" wikidata="Q917998" url="?curid=541428" title="Docklands Stadium">
<text>Docklands Stadium, known by naming rights sponsorship as Marvel Stadium, is a multi-purpose sports and entertainment stadium in the suburb of Docklands in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Construction started in October 1997 and was completed in 2000 at a cost of A$460 million ($930 million in 2023 terms). The stadium features a retractable roof and the ground level seating can be converted from oval to rectangular configuration.

The stadium is primarily used for Australian rules football and was originally built as a replacement for Waverley Park. Offices at the precinct serve as the headquarters of the Australian Football League (AFL) which, since October 2016, has had exclusive ownership of the venue. With a capacity for over 53,000 spectators for sports, it is the second-largest stadium in Melbourne after the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It has hosted a number of other sporting events—including domestic Twenty20 cricket matches, Melbourne Victory soccer home matches, rugby league and rugby union matches, as well as special events and concerts. The precinct is headquarters for the Seven Network&#x27;s digital broadcast centre and an NAB branch.

==History==
===Construction===

Plans for the stadium were announced in October 1996 as a more centrally located replacement for the much larger but ageing Waverley Park as a headquarters for the Australian Football League. It was built in the Melbourne Docklands to the immediate west of the CBD, a central but largely deserted industrial area which had just begun its own urban renewal project. Construction of the stadium by Baulderstone began in October 1997 under the working name &quot;Victoria Stadium&quot;, and was completed ahead of the 2000 AFL season. The stadium was originally developed by the Docklands Stadium Consortium and thereafter controlled by the Seven Network. The remaining leasehold interest in the stadium was sold to James Fielding Funds Management in June 2006 for A$330 million.

The stadium, like Waverley Park, was built primarily for Australian rules football, unlike most grounds of a similar size in Australia which were originally designed for cricket then later developed for football. It was the first Australian rules football stadium built with a retractable roof, which throughout its history has usually been closed for night matches and for wet weather day matches; the roof closure policy for dry weather day matches has varied. It was the first stadium in Australia to have movable seating. All four level-one tiers of the stadium can be moved up to 18 metres forward into a rectangular configuration. Despite this being a key feature of the stadium design, it has rarely been used, due to damage to turf, time to deploy the seats, and a reduced capacity, since the corner bays of the stadium become unavailable in rectangular configuration.

===Development===
Construction was finished only weeks before the first match, and some scheduled pre-season matches were relocated as a result. The first match to be played at the ground was between and , before a crowd of 43,012, on 9 March 2000. Essendon won the match by 94 points, and Michael Long kicked the first goal at the ground. The game was to have been played under the closed roof, but due to technical issues it remained open. Six days later, Barbra Streisand staged the venue&#x27;s first concert. The stadium&#x27;s third football game, between Western Bulldogs and Brisbane Lions on 19 March, was the first to be played under the roof. On 16 August 2000, the world&#x27;s first indoor One Day International was held at the venue between Australia and South Africa. The first game played in the rectangular configuration was a Melbourne Storm game in July 2001. The first soccer match played was in round 5 2001 of the National Soccer League between South Melbourne FC and Melbourne Knights FC.

From the beginning, the stadium&#x27;s playing surface was criticised for its slipperiness, hardness and lack of grass coverage, and the increased risk of injury that this causes to players. Maintaining surface quality remains one of the stadium&#x27;s biggest challenges. The stadium&#x27;s orientation and highly built-up grandstands mean that the Northern end of the stadium in particular receives only 6 weeks of sunlight a year. Concerts held at the stadium are also usually placed at the Southern end due to the ability for grass to recover more quickly. The entire surface undergoes regular, expensive replacement during the season with turf grown externally, under contract by HG Turf, whereas the responsibility of laying and managing the turf lies with Docklands Stadium management. Since 2007, elaborate heating and lighting to better allow grass to be grown and managed within the stadium have been in use.

The venue was damaged by a thunderstorm in March 2010 during the 2010 Victorian storms. The external roof at Gate 2 caved in, causing damage and flooding inside the entertainment area. That evening&#x27;s pre-season match between and was delayed due to WorkSafe inspections, but it still went ahead before a small crowd of 5,000.
In 2015, LED electronic advertising was added around the perimeter of the ground on level 1 and 2, as well as a strip synthetic turf around the edge of the fence, outside the boundary line. The synthetic strip was narrowed after Brisbane Lions player Michael Close suffered a season ending ACL injury on the uneven surface during a game in 2015.

The stadium became unpopular with many of its tenant clubs, especially , and , as high operating costs and the high proportion of gate revenues which were paid back to the stadium meant that clubs earned much lower returns for a game at Docklands than they would have earned from the same attendance at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. At least 20,000 spectators were usually required to break even on a game. Those three clubs all received compensation payments from the AFL to balance the weak deals, and sold occasional home matches to small interstate or international venues for greater financial returns than they could earn at Docklands.

The stadium and broader precinct underwent a $225 million redevelopment, funded by the AFL and Victorian Government, between 2021 and 2024. This included two new video screens, which hang underneath the stadium&#x27;s roof and were installed behind the goal at each end of the stadium ahead of the 2022 AFL season. The rest of the redevelopment upgraded stadium infrastructure, connected the precinct to the Melbourne CBD and opened up access to the Docklands waterfront. The redevelopment was completed in March 2024.

In May 2023, Docklands Stadium opened The Runner, becoming the first venue in the Southern Hemisphere to utilise Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology for checkout-free purchases. The Runner outlets, consisting of one bar and one food kiosk, work by having attendees scanning their credit or debit card, or mobile wallet payment option at the entry, entering to collect their items, and then leaving the outlet without having to wait in line to checkout. The outlets utilises cameras, sensors, machine learning algorithms, motion tracking and artificial intelligence like computer vision and deep learning techniques, including generative AI, to accurately determine who took what in any retail environment.

===Ownership===
Under the terms of the agreement governing construction and operation of the venue, in 2025 the AFL was to win ownership of the stadium for a nominal $30 fee; but the AFL Commission opted to purchase exclusive ownership of the stadium earlier than this, in October 2016, for approximately $200 million. This purchase left the stadium&#x27;s tenant AFL clubs millions of dollars better off, as they and the AFL arranged more favourable tenancy agreements; although clubs continue to make more money at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, leading to a push from tenant clubs , and to reduce their annual matches at the ground. The stadium was eventually integrated into the AFL structure several years later, ending the independent management of the venue by Melbourne Stadiums Limited.

The purchase also soon proved critically important to the AFL&#x27;s finances during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was able to leverage its ownership of the stadium in obtaining a $500–600 million line of credit to cover cash flow shortages when the 2020 AFL season was suspended.

==Naming rights history==

The stadium has never operated under the name &#x27;Docklands Stadium&#x27;, having been covered by naming rights deals throughout its entire operating history. When it opened, the Colonial State Bank paid $32.5 million for 10 years of naming rights, and the stadium opened as Colonial Stadium. The same year, Commonwealth Bank took over the Colonial State Bank and began to discontinue the brand. Commonwealth then sold the balance of the naming rights contract to Telstra for about $50 million, and the stadium&#x27;s name was changed to Telstra Dome in October 2002. During this time it was colloquially referred to as &quot;The Dome&quot; – a colloquialism used actively by clubs which were sponsored by rival telecommunications companies (such as with 3 and with Optus).

In March 2009, the naming rights transferred to Etihad Airways. The venue became known as Etihad Stadium under a five-year deal, which was later extended to ten years, at a cost estimated at between $5–$8 million per year. This once again caused problems, as the AFL would not initially recognise the new name due to its deal with rival airline Qantas. The league recognised the new name only after further negotiation between the two parties.

In September 2018, the stadium was renamed Marvel Stadium after the stadium operators negotiated an eight-year deal with the Walt Disney Company, the parent company of Marvel Entertainment, to change the naming rights and install a Marvel retail store at the venue.

==Stadium features==
*Oval-shaped, turf playing surface of or 
*Retractable roof above the playing surface, opens east–west, and takes eight minutes to fully open or close.
*Movable seating (4 sections of the lower tier can move 18 metres forward to give a rectangular configuration)
*Two large internal video screens, one behind each goal (installed 2022); and two smaller internal video screens on opposite flanks of the field (original construction) – displaying scores, video replays and advertisements.
*1,000 video seats
*13 function rooms
*66 corporate boxes
*Premium Club membership area, The Medallion Club
*1700 car parking spaces across 3 levels beneath the playing surface.
*Over 700 2,000-watt lights for arena illumination
*A varying capacity of between 12,000 and 74,000, depending on the event. For example, seats can be laid on the ground.
*An AFL capacity of 53,359
*Dimensions of playing area are 159.5 metres by 128.5 metres (174.4 yards by 140.5 yards)
The ends of the ground, where the AFL goal posts are located, are named after the two leading goalkickers in VFL/AFL history: the northern end is the Lockett End, after Tony Lockett; and the southern end is the Coventry End, after Gordon Coventry. Some clubs informally use alternative names during their home games in place of those to honour their own histories.

==Use==
===Australian rules football===

As of 2024, five AFL teams have deals in place to play home games at Docklands Stadium:
* – ten home games per year. The club has played almost all home games at the venue since it opened in 2000.
* – nine home games per year. The club has played almost all home games at the venue since it opened in 2000.
* – seven home games per year. The venue has been the club&#x27;s primary home ground since 2005, but it had previously played about five games per year from 2000 to 2004.
* – seven home games per year. The club has a 25-year deal, which has been in place since the stadium opened in 2000.
* – six home games per year. The club has a deal for six home games per year in place since 2005, with the exception of 2015–2017 when five home games were played. 

All Victorian-based AFL teams, including those not listed here, have played some home games at the ground during its history, owing to a contractual requirement between the AFL and the stadium&#x27;s original owners to stage at least 46 AFL matches per year until 2013, and 40 matches per year thereafter. and both had deals to play around four home matches per year during the 2000s, with the latter playing two home games per year at the ground since 2014. Most other clubs still play one or two home matches there per year to make up the numbers; for example, have played one home game per year at the ground since 2011 and have played one home game per year at the ground since 2017. 

In 2020, to mark 20 years of AFL football at the ground, the AFL named the 20 biggest moments and stories involving games played at the stadium in a video. The top 5 were as follows:

# Jason McCartney&#x27;s AFL return after nearly dying in the 2002 Bali bombings – North Melbourne vs Richmond, Round 11 (6 June), 2003
# Lance Franklin completing a 100-goal season in 2008 – Hawthorn vs Carlton, Round 22 (30 August), 2008
# Wayne Carey&#x27;s return to face North Melbourne after his extramarital scandal involving former teammate Anthony Stevens – North Melbourne vs Adelaide, Round 6 (2 May), 2003
# James Hird leading a final-quarter comeback with 15 touches and the winning goal – Essendon vs West Coast, Round 3 (10 April), 2004
# St Kilda and Geelong facing off after both clubs started the 2009 season 13–0, the latest meeting of unbeaten teams in a season – St Kilda vs Geelong, Round 14 (5 July), 2009

===Cricket===
The venue&#x27;s major summer tenant is Big Bash League side Melbourne Renegades, which has played its home games at the Docklands Stadium since the league&#x27;s inception in 2011/12. A drop-in pitch is used to facilitate cricket at the venue. At the end of the 2016/17 Big Bash, the stadium was rated the most entertaining venue for T20 cricket in Australia.

In 2016, Chris Gayle of the Renegades and the West Indies tied the record for the fastest T20 half century (12 balls) during the last round of BBL 5 at the ground against the Adelaide Strikers.

Although rare, multiple players have hit the roof during a game, which is 38 metres (125 feet) above the playing surface. For example, in 2018, Perth Scorchers batsman Ashton Turner hit a Dan Christian delivery into the roof; under the BBL rules, such a hit is considered to be six runs, with the ball being considered dead and unable to be caught for the purpose of getting the batsman out.

===Soccer===
The first time it was used for soccer was in 2001 between South Melbourne and Melbourne Knights in the NSL. A-League team Melbourne Victory played home matches at the stadium between 2006–07 and 2020–21. Originally, the plan was that the stadium would only be used for games against its biggest rivals, Sydney FC, in the 2006–07 A-League; but after the success of that game, the club shifted permanently from Olympic Park Stadium to Docklands from the 2006–07 season until the 2009–10 season. This gave the stadium its first major summer tenant. After the opening of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium in 2010, the club played only high-drawing games and finals at Docklands, with all other games being played at the new stadium; and as of the 2022–23 season, Victory ceased playing home matches at the stadium. The stadium hosted the 2024 A-Leagues All Stars Games on 24 May 2024, as part of Global Football Week Melbourne.

===Rugby league===
In the 2001 National Rugby League season, the stadium was the permanent home ground for the Melbourne Storm, but this deal lasted only one year. The club occasionally hosted high-drawing home games and finals at Docklands after that, including their first three home games of the 2010 NRL season while awaiting the completion of their then new home ground AAMI Park. In 2023, the Storm returned to play two games at the ground, while AAMI Park was unavailable in July–August due to the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Docklands has also hosted interstate and international rugby league games. As Telstra Dome, Docklands hosted its first State of Origin game in 2006 as it hosted the deciding third game. As Etihad Stadium, the stadium also hosted Origin games in 2009 and 2012. The 2012 match attracted 56,021, a new record for rugby league at the stadium.

===Other sports===
The stadium has been converted to host several other sporting events. In its early years, the stadium was used for off-season one day international cricket matches, but has also held some summer matches, particularly in 2006 when the Melbourne Cricket Ground was unavailable due to preparations for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The venue has also hosted international rugby union – including being Melbourne&#x27;s venue during the 2003 Rugby World Cup – although the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium now hosts most such games. The venue has hosted international basketball, Rugby 7s at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, a 2002 non-televised WWE live event as part of the WWE Global Warning Tour: Melbourne, the 2015 UFC 193 in front of a then-record UFC attendance of 56,214 fans, a motorcycle speedway event (when it played host to the 2015 Speedway Grand Prix of Australia on a long temporary track), and a controversial international darts event in 2015 in which spectators seated on the arena started throwing chairs and furniture.

===Non-sports events===
Outside of sporting events, the stadium hosts special events and concerts. Adele holds the record for the largest concert attendance at the stadium, on the Adele Live 2017 tour. Ed Sheeran holds the record for the largest concert series attendance at the stadium, on the Divide World Tour. In November 2023, the stadium was the first in Australia to hold a K-pop concert and the first in Australia to be headlined by a female group, when Twice held their Ready to Be World Tour concert at the stadium.

RMIT University uses the stadium as the site for its graduation ceremonies annually.

<text>Sir Leonard Hutton (23 June 1916 – 6 September 1990) was an English cricketer. He played as an opening batsman for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1934 to 1955 and for England in 79 Test matches between 1937 and 1955. &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; described him as &quot;one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket&quot;. He set a record in 1938 for the highest individual innings in a Test match in only his sixth Test appearance, scoring 364 runs against Australia, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years (and remains an England Test record 84 years later as of 2023). Following the Second World War, he was the mainstay of England&#x27;s batting. In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy England won the Ashes the following year for the first time in 19 years.

Marked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and quickly established himself at county level. By 1937, he was playing for England and when the war interrupted his career in 1939, critics regarded him as one of the leading batsmen in the country, and even the world. During the war, he received a serious injury to his arm while taking part in a commando training course. His arm never fully recovered, forcing him to alter his batting style. When cricket restarted, Hutton resumed his role as one of England&#x27;s leading batsmen; by the time of England&#x27;s tour to Australia in 1950–51, the team relied heavily on his batting and did so for the remainder of his career. As a batsman, Hutton was cautious and built his style on a sound defence. Although capable of attacking strokeplay, both Yorkshire and England depended on him, and awareness of this affected his style. Hutton remains statistically among the best batsmen to have played Test cricket.

Hutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, although his leadership was at times controversial. His cautious approach led critics to accuse him of negativity. Never comfortable in the role, Hutton felt that the former amateur players who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. Knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956, he went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket and became president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.

==Early life==

Hutton was born on 23 June 1916 in the Moravian community of Fulneck, Pudsey, the youngest of five children to Henry Hutton and his wife Lily (née Swithenbank). Many of his family were local cricketers and Hutton soon became immersed in the sport, which he both played and read about with enthusiasm. He practised in the playground of Littlemoor Council School, which he attended from 1921 until 1930, and at Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club, which he joined as a junior. At the age of 12, he made his first appearance for Pudsey St Lawrence&#x27;s second eleven and by 1929 had reached the first team. Locals encouraged him to meet the Yorkshire and England cricketer Herbert Sutcliffe, a neighbour, from whom Hutton received coaching in Sutcliffe&#x27;s garden. Sutcliffe was impressed by the young batsman, and commended him to Yorkshire as a good prospect.

Following this endorsement, Hutton went to the county&#x27;s indoor practice shed at Headingley in February 1930. George Hirst, a former Yorkshire cricketer responsible for assessing and coaching young players, believed that Hutton&#x27;s batting technique was essentially already complete. Bill Bowes, the Yorkshire pace bowler, was equally impressed, and helped Hutton to correct a minor flaw in his technique. Hutton was sufficiently encouraged to decide to attempt a career in professional cricket, but at the prompting of his parents decided to learn a trade as well. During 1930, he watched the Australian Don Bradman hit 334 at Headingley in a Test match, then a record individual score in Tests—which he himself would surpass eight years later. Later that year, Hutton enrolled at Pudsey Grammar School where he spent a year studying technical drawing and quantitative work before joining his father at a local building firm, Joseph Verity. After becoming a professional cricketer, Hutton continued to work for the company during winter months until 1939.

==Career before the Second World War==

===First years with Yorkshire===

By 1933, Hutton was regularly opening the batting for the Pudsey St Lawrence first team in the Bradford Cricket League. By close observation of his opening partner, the former Yorkshire county batsman Edgar Oldroyd, Hutton further developed his batting technique, especially in defence. The local press soon identified Hutton as a player of promise, particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 not out in the Priestley Cup. Senior figures within Yorkshire cricket identified him as a potential successor to Percy Holmes as an opening partner to Sutcliffe; at this stage in his career, Hutton was also considered a promising leg spin bowler. In the 1933 season Hutton was selected for the Yorkshire Second Eleven. Although he failed to score a run in either of his first two innings, over the season he scored 699 runs at an average of 69.90. Yorkshire appointed Cyril Turner as Hutton&#x27;s mentor; Hedley Verity and Bowes also offered Hutton guidance in his early career.

Hutton made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1934, at the age of 17 the youngest Yorkshire player since Hirst, 45 years earlier. In his first match, against Cambridge University, he was run out for a duck but scored an unbeaten 50 runs in his second match; he followed this with another half-century against Warwickshire on his County Championship debut. He played regularly for the rest of the season but to prevent his overexposure to Championship cricket, Yorkshire limited his appearances and returned him periodically to the second eleven. In matches for the first team, Hutton shared large first-wicket partnerships with Wilf Barber and with Arthur Mitchell, before scoring his maiden first-class century in an innings of 196 against Worcestershire. At the time, he was the youngest Yorkshire batsman to score a first-class century. He finished the season with a total of 863 runs at an average of 33.19;

An operation on his nose before the 1935 season delayed Hutton&#x27;s appearance on the cricket field that year. Attempting to return too quickly, he endured poor health which limited his subsequent appearances and effectiveness; by the middle of August he had scored a total of just 73 runs. A century against Middlesex led to run of bigger scores, and his contribution to Yorkshire&#x27;s County Championship victory that season was 577 runs at an average in first-class matches of 28.85. In the winter of 1935–36 Hutton went on his first overseas tour, as Yorkshire visited Jamaica. In the 1936 season he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time—1,282 runs at an average of 29.81—and was awarded his county cap in July. He took part in several large partnerships through the season, including one of 230 with Sutcliffe, although he experienced a sequence of low scores in May and June.

Throughout his first seasons, Hutton faced press criticism for his caution and reluctance to play attacking shots. Although regarding him a certain England selection in the future, critics thought Hutton slightly dull and pedestrian. Yorkshire remained unconcerned; cricket writer Alan Hill believes Hutton&#x27;s subsequent success was built on this initial establishment of a defensive technique. His achievements brought limited recognition, owing to the high level of expectation surrounding him. This sense of frustration was heightened by comments from Sutcliffe in 1935, when he wrote that Hutton was &quot;a certainty for a place as England&#x27;s opening batsman. He is a marvel – the discovery of a generation ... His technique is that of a maestro.&quot; Such praise was rare from Sutcliffe, but Hutton found the comments a burden, while others found them embarrassing.

===Test match debut===
After Hutton began 1937 with a series of high scores—including an innings of 271 against Derbyshire, the reigning County Champions, and 153 against Leicestershire two days later when he and Sutcliffe shared a 315-run opening partnership—he was chosen to play for England against New Zealand in the first Test match of the season. On 26 June, he made his Test debut at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, scoring 0 and 1. Retaining his place in the England team after scoring centuries for Yorkshire in the following games, he scored his maiden Test hundred on 24 July in the second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester. He batted for three-and-a-half hours to score exactly 100 runs and shared a century opening partnership with Charlie Barnett. Hutton&#x27;s remaining two innings in the Test series yielded 14 and 12, giving him 127 runs at an average of 25.40. Also in 1937, Hutton made his first appearance for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord&#x27;s. In total that year he scored 2,888 runs, more than double his previous seasonal best, at an average of 56.62 and including ten centuries. He also recorded the best bowling performance of his career, six wickets for 76 against Leicestershire, altogether taking ten wickets in the match—the only time he achieved this. His performances that year earned him selection as one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; Cricketers of the Year. The citation praised his attitude, technique, fielding and bowling, noting however that some commentators continued to criticise his overcaution.

In early matches of the 1938 season, with an Ashes series against Australia pending, Hutton made three centuries and scored 93 not out. Selected for a Test trial, he shared a century opening partnership with Bill Edrich, and was selected for the first Test at Trent Bridge in Nottingham beginning on 28 June. In just over three hours, Hutton scored 100 from 221 deliveries on his Ashes debut, adding 219 with Charlie Barnett for the first wicket. England, in Wally Hammond&#x27;s first match as Test captain, posted a total of 658 for eight wickets, but the match was drawn. Hutton failed in the second Test, with two single figure scores in another drawn game. He was generally unsuccessful with the bat in the following weeks, during which the third Test was entirely rained off. Following a sequence of low scores for Yorkshire, Hutton&#x27;s finger was broken in a match against Middlesex played on a dangerous pitch at Lord&#x27;s. Consequently, he could not play in the fourth Test, played at his home ground, Headingley, in which England were soundly beaten. After missing a month of cricket, Hutton played just two games before his selection for the final Test of the series.

===Test record score===

The last Test was played at The Oval and began on 20 August 1938. Hammond won the toss on a very good pitch for batting, and after an early wicket fell, Hutton and Maurice Leyland, his Yorkshire teammate, took the score to 347 for one wicket after the first day. Hutton was unbeaten on 160 although Australia missed a chance to dismiss him, stumped, when he had scored 40. After a rest day, the Yorkshire batsmen took their partnership to 382 before Leyland was out. Hutton then shared substantial partnerships with Hammond and Joe Hardstaff junior, taking his personal score to 300 at the end of the second day, out of a total of 634 for five. In the process he surpassed the previous highest Test score by an England batsman in a home match. Hutton maintained caution throughout; &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that his dominance of the bowling had become slightly monotonous after two days, although it recognised his skill. On the third day (23 August), the Australians made a concerted effort to dismiss Hutton before he broke Bradman&#x27;s 1930 record Ashes score of 334— the record score in a Test match was Hammond&#x27;s 336 not out against New Zealand, but it was compiled against what was perceived as inferior bowling, and Bradman&#x27;s total was more prestigious. Although showing nerves as he approached the record, Hutton passed Bradman&#x27;s score with a cut off Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, and extended his score to 364 before he was out, caught. Lasting for more than 13 hours, with 847 balls faced, Hutton&#x27;s innings was the longest in first-class cricket at the time. It was only the sixth Test of his career. The innings was the highest individual score in a Test until Garfield Sobers scored 365 not out in 1958; it remains the 6th highest in Tests and is the most runs scored in an innings by an English player. England eventually scored 903, the highest team total in a Test at that time, before Hammond declared the innings closed. Australia were bowled out twice and England won by an innings and 579 runs to draw the series with one victory apiece.

Commentators mainly praised Hutton&#x27;s concentration and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly when compared to Bradman&#x27;s innings of 334, was excused on the grounds that the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, Les Ames believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain Bob Wyatt described the innings as one of the greatest feats of concentration and endurance in the history of the game. Some critics expressed distaste at England&#x27;s approach, but this opinion was not widely shared. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst things that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.

===Leading batsman===
From October 1938, Hutton toured South Africa with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—the name by which England teams toured at the time—under the captaincy of Hammond; England won the series 1–0, with the other four games drawn. He scored centuries in two early matches but in a match against Transvaal, a delivery from Eric Davies knocked him unconscious and forced him to miss the first Test. Unsuccessful on his return in the second Test, Hutton scored a double century in the following tour match, but had another low score in the third Test, which England won. He was more successful in the final Tests. In the fourth, on a difficult pitch for batting, he scored 92. The final Test was drawn after ten days of play in a supposedly &quot;timeless&quot; Test. In a match which set a record aggregate of runs, Hutton scored 38 and 55 but his contributions were overshadowed by the heavy scoring of others. Although Hutton scored 265 runs in the Test series, at an average of 44.16, critics were disappointed, expecting more after his record innings of 1938. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs at an average of 64.88, the highest aggregate among the tourists, and accumulated five centuries. Spectators found his batting attractive and the &quot;Wisden&quot; correspondent regarded him the most accomplished batsman on the tour.

In its summary of the 1939 season, &quot;Wisden&quot; noted the development of Hutton into a more exciting batsman to watch, observing that he &quot;gave further evidence of being one of the world&#x27;s greatest batsmen&quot;. He began to dominate opening partnerships with Sutcliffe, in contrast to prior seasons when he was the junior partner. In total, he scored 2,883 runs, over 400 more than any other batsman and his average of 62.27 placed him second in the national averages behind Hammond. Among his twelve centuries, Hutton scored his highest total for Yorkshire, 280 not out in six hours against Hampshire, sharing an opening partnership of 315 with Sutcliffe. His contributions helped Yorkshire to their third successive Championship. He was also successful in representative matches, scoring 86 for the Players against the Gentlemen, and compiling 480 runs (averaging 96.00) in the Test matches against West Indies. England won the series, after recording victory in the first match and drawing the others. Hutton scored 196 in the first Test, hitting his last 96 runs in 95 minutes; he and Denis Compton scored 248 runs together in 133 minutes. After low scores in the second Test, Hutton scored 73 and 165 not out in the final game at the Oval. Facing a West Indian lead of 146, he batted five hours in the second innings, sharing a partnership of 264 with Hammond. He ended his season with a century against Sussex in Yorkshire&#x27;s final match before the war; two days after its conclusion, the Second World War began.

==Wartime injury and recovery==
At the beginning of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his ulna at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the Royal Engineers, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton&#x27;s recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.

Hutton resumed professional cricket with Pudsey St Lawrence in 1943, briefly captaining the team before poor results and a disagreement with the committee led him to resign the captaincy. He played for Pudsey until 1945, batting successfully and helping the team to the Priestley Cup, but his relationship with the club remained strained and he did not play for them again after 1945. When the war ended in 1945, a programme of first-class matches was organised, involving counties and other teams. A series of matches was played between England and an Australian Services cricket team, called Victory Tests although they were not official Test matches. Hutton played in all three games with mixed success. He scored 46 in the second match, but was struck painfully on his weak arm by a short ball from Keith Miller, whom he encountered for the first time. After scoring 81 for Yorkshire against the Australian team, Hutton scored 104 and 69 in the final &quot;Test&quot;. Another century followed for Yorkshire against the Australians, taking his first-class run aggregate to 782 runs at an average of 48.87 in nine games. Commentators were satisfied that his batting technique remained effective and that he could still succeed at the highest level. The showpiece match of the season was England against the Dominions at Lord&#x27;s, but Hutton was prevented from appearing by his commitments to Pudsey.

==Career after the war==
===First tour to Australia===
County cricket fully resumed in 1946. Hutton was troubled by his injury; his wrists no longer rotated fully and he abandoned the hook shot. Nevertheless, he scored 1,552 runs at an average of 48.50, and was recognised by &quot;Wisden&quot; as Yorkshire&#x27;s most effective batsman as the county won their fourth consecutive championship title. His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team, but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs at an average of 30.75. England won the series 1–0 but Hutton&#x27;s only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he was troubled by a bad back. He was omitted from the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the MCC team touring party for the 1946–47 tour of Australia.

The MCC were reluctant to tour so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent. The tourists, led once more by Wally Hammond, were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, finding their opponents much stronger than expected. Hutton began the tour well, scoring two early centuries, the latter of which was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as the best English innings of the tour. A string of other good performances drew praise from press and former players; one such report named him the best batsman in the world. However, Hutton failed to reach a score of 50 runs in the first three Tests; in the first, he was out for a first ball duck, and in the second, a short ball from Keith Miller struck him on his injured arm. In the second innings of the latter game, he quickly scored 37, frequently driving the bowling of Miller and Fred Freer before the bat slipped from his hand and hit the wicket, ending the innings. Even so, the display was praised by critics.

In the final two Tests, Hutton shared three consecutive century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton&#x27;s performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton&#x27;s preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced the impression that he was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsillitis, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.

===Series against South Africa and West Indies===

Hutton&#x27;s tonsils were removed before the start of the 1947 season but his poor health continued, forcing him to miss some games at the start of the season. Nevertheless, his form remained good and he scored four centuries in early matches. Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, affected by the retirement of key players and the frequent loss of Hutton to representative cricket. In the Test matches Hutton did not initially score heavily. His highest innings after three Tests was only 24 runs, and critics called his place into question. He returned to form during the fourth Test, his first at Headingley, with a four-and-a-half-hour century on a difficult pitch for batting. Hutton scored 83 and 36 in the drawn final Test, and England won the series 3–0 with the other two games drawn. Hutton hit 344 runs in the Test series at an average of 44.00; in all first-class matches, he scored eleven centuries and totalled 2,585 runs at an average 64.62, although his achievements that season were overshadowed by those of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, who both broke the previous record for most runs scored in a season.

After 16 months of continuous cricket, Hutton chose to miss the 1947–48 winter MCC tour of the West Indies. However, injuries severely affected that team, and its captain Gubby Allen requested reinforcements. Subsequently, Hutton flew out to join the tour;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcc47/48&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after he arrived, having travelled for four days, Hutton played against British Guiana, scoring 138 and 62 not out, before appearing in the third Test. After a century against Jamaica, Hutton played innings of 56 and 60 in the fourth and final Test, giving him 171 runs at an average of 42.75 in the series. He came top of the first-class averages for the tourists, with 578 runs at an average of 64.22, and was judged by &quot;Wisden&quot; as one of the few batting successes in a team which lost the four-Test series 2–0 and failed to win a single match on tour.

===Struggles against pace===
During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing more than half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average than anyone else in the side. In county matches, Hutton averaged 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team&#x27;s dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton&#x27;s main challenge that season came from the Australian side which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In the early part of the tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton&#x27;s confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire&#x27;s match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.

Hutton was selected for the first Test, but England were overwhelmed by the Australian fast bowlers and lost the match. After a failure in the first innings, Hutton scored 74 in the second, and briefly established dominance over Miller, who responded with a series of bouncers, one of which struck Hutton on the shoulder and provoked an angry reaction from the crowd. Miller bowled him in very poor light at the start of the fourth day&#x27;s play. At Lord&#x27;s in the second Test, also lost by England, Hutton scored 20 and 13, but of more concern to critics was the manner in which he batted. In the second innings, England had to bat for a long time to save the game, &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that Hutton, in contrast to his opening partner Washbrook, looked &quot;plainly uncomfortable&quot;. He was nearly dismissed several times before he was out for 13, and returned to the pavilion to an uncomfortable silence from the crowd. The former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton, covering the tour as a journalist, described it as Hutton&#x27;s worst effort in a Test. Bill O&#x27;Reilly, another former Australian player working as a journalist, said Hutton seemed to be struggling with concentration and was a shadow of his former self.

Following his struggles at Lord&#x27;s, Hutton was omitted from the team for the third Test. Observers had noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers, which the English selectors saw as a poor example from a leading batsman. The decision generated considerable acrimony, but surprised and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat. Press and critics generally judged the omission a mistake, although the &quot;Wisden&quot; correspondent believed the decision to be correct as Hutton benefited from a break. In later years, Norman Yardley, the England captain, agreed that the choice was a poor one. Hutton, who escaped most of the debate by playing in Scotland for Yorkshire, found the situation unsettling and Patrick Murphy, a sports journalist, writes that it &quot;served to drive a reserved man further in on himself.&quot; Meanwhile, Hutton was chosen to captain the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord&#x27;s; he scored 59 and 132 not out.

Recalled to the England team for the fourth Test at Headingley, Hutton scored 81 and 57. Given an excellent reception by his home crowd, he shared a century opening partnership with Washbrook in both innings, the second time they had accomplished this feat. Critics considered Hutton to be a better batsmen when he returned and that these innings repaired his damaged reputation. Australia needed 404 to win on a pitch favouring spin, but the poor performances of the main bowlers allowed Australia to record a seven wicket win described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;astonishing&quot;. Hutton&#x27;s contribution to the second Australian innings was to bowl four overs and concede 30 runs. Australia&#x27;s dominance in the series was sealed by a crushing win in the fifth Test. England were bowled out for 52 runs in the first innings, of which Hutton scored 30 before being last out to an exceptional catch down the leg side from wicketkeeper Don Tallon. &quot;Wisden&quot; described Hutton as &quot;the one exception to complete failure&quot;, while other critics noted he always looked comfortable. Facing a huge deficit in their second innings, England were bowled out for 188. Hutton scored 64, playing a similar defensive role to his first innings. In the Test series, Hutton scored 342 runs at an average of 42.75. In all first-class matches, he reached 2,654 runs at an average of 64.73.

===Leading batsman again===
Hutton toured South Africa in the winter of 1948–49 with the MCC under the captaincy of George Mann. &quot;Wisden&quot; described Hutton&#x27;s tour as a succession of triumphs until he tired at the end: &quot;Hutton&#x27;s driving aroused the greatest admiration, but all his strokes were stamped with the hallmark of class.&quot; Before the Test matches began, Hutton scored three centuries and then contributed 83 as England won the first Test. The next three Tests were drawn. In the second match, Hutton and Washbrook set a new Test match record opening partnership. In easy batting conditions, they shared 359 runs on the first day before Hutton was out for 158 after almost five hours batting. In more favourable bowling conditions in the third Test, Hutton scored 41 and 87, followed by 123 in the fourth game which settled England&#x27;s second innings at a dangerous time. England won the final game to take the series 2–0, and Hutton finished the Test series with 577 runs at an average of 64.11, while in all first-class matches he recorded 1,477 runs at an average of 73.85.

The most successful season of Hutton&#x27;s career in terms of runs scored was 1949; he scored 3,429 runs at an average of 68.58, the fourth highest aggregate of runs in an English season. In both June and August he scored over 1,000 runs; his 1,294 runs in June was a record for a single month and only Herbert Sutcliffe had previously passed 1,000 runs for a calendar month twice in a season. He scored a double century against Lancashire, only the second for a Yorkshire batsman in the fixture. With Hutton available for more matches than in the previous few seasons, Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex, their last success until 1959. In the four Test matches against the touring New Zealanders, all of which were drawn, Hutton scored 469 runs at an average of 78.16. He scored 101 in the first Test, and fifties in the second and third matches, before ending the series with an innings of 206 in the fourth Test, in which the second hundred runs took only 85 minutes.

Hutton scored 2,049 runs at an average of 56.91 in the 1950 season. Batting effectively on a succession of early season rain-affected wickets, Hutton frequently top-scored for Yorkshire. Hutton&#x27;s benefit match against Middlesex was affected by rain, but other events, collections and insurance for loss of play gave Hutton £9,713, a record at that point for a Yorkshire cricketer. Two-thirds of the amount was invested on Hutton&#x27;s behalf by the Yorkshire committee, following their usual practice; Hutton resented this paternalism from the committee, particularly as he did not receive the full amount until 1972. Hutton played in three of the four Tests against West Indies. In the first Test, hampered by a finger injury, he scored 39 and 45 as England recorded their only victory of the series. The West Indies won the second Test, their first Test victory in England, and won the final two Tests to take the series 3–1; Hutton missed the third Test with lumbago but in the fourth Test scored 202 not out, carrying his bat through England&#x27;s first innings. The West Indian spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine caused difficulties for all the batsmen except Hutton, who always appeared comfortable. &quot;Wisden&quot; praised his effort as unforgettable.

===Australia 1950–51===

Hutton was chosen to go on the MCC tour of Australia in 1950–51, under the captaincy of the amateur Freddie Brown. The latter was an unexpected choice as captain, after a struggle to find a suitable amateur for the role. As a compromise aimed at critics who favoured the appointment of a professional captain, the professional Denis Compton was made vice-captain, but Brown came to rely more on Hutton than on Compton for advice. The tour selectors, in an attempt to strengthen the batting line-up, asked Hutton to bat in the middle order rather than his usual position as opener. He batted well in the early games but the team struggled. In the first Test, England dismissed Australia for 228 before rain made the pitch difficult for batting. In reply, England collapsed to 68 for seven before Brown declared to make Australia bat again while the pitch was still treacherous. Australia in turn struggled to 32 for seven, before declaring to leave England needing 193 to win. By the end of the third day&#x27;s play, victory seemed unlikely as England were 30 for six. Next morning on a slightly easier pitch, Hutton scored 62 not out, an innings which was widely acclaimed in the press. &quot;Wisden&quot; observed that he had &quot;given yet another exhibition of his wonderful batsmanship on tricky turf ... Hutton thrashed the fast bowlers majestically and played the turning or lifting ball with the ease of a master craftsman.&quot; However, the team were bowled out for 122 and Australia won by 70 runs.

Hutton remained in the middle order for the second Test, which England lost by 28 runs, but resumed his role as opener for the rest of the tour and scored a century in the following state game. Hutton scored 62 in the third Test, but the Australian spinner Jack Iverson, who caused the touring batsmen huge problems all series, bowled Australia to victory. Hutton&#x27;s form continued in the fourth Test as he carried his bat for the second time in six months. &quot;Wisden&quot; observed: &quot;Against Hutton the bowling looked almost mediocre, but most of the other batsmen made it appear lethal.&quot; He scored 156 not out and added 45 more runs in the second innings, but Australia won by 274 runs. With the series lost, England won the final game, their first victory over Australia since the war and Australia&#x27;s first defeat in 26 matches; Hutton contributed scores of 79 and 60 not out and struck the winning run. Hutton scored 553 Test runs at an average of 88.83, and in all first-class matches accumulated 1,199 runs with five centuries and an average of 70.52. In contrast to his previous Australian tour, Hutton played the short ball comfortably. Reviewing the tour, &quot;Wisden&quot; stated, &quot;With Hutton, figures did not lie. He stood head and shoulders above every other batsman and, taking all factors into consideration, worthily earned the description of the finest present-day batsman in the world.&quot;

===100th century===
Hutton scored 2,145 runs in 1951 with nine centuries, including his 100th in first-class cricket. The South Africans toured England, losing the Test series 3–1. After Hutton scored fifty in the first Test, which was won by South Africa, his 100th century almost came during the third Test, when he scored an unbeaten 98 in the second innings to take England to victory. But the innings provoked controversy when Hutton&#x27;s teammates seemed to decline easy runs to allow Hutton the opportunity to reach his hundred before the end of the match, thereby jeopardising England&#x27;s chances of victory in unsettled weather. The 100th century came a week later, against Surrey, when Hutton became the thirteenth player to achieve the landmark. He followed this immediately with 194 not out against Nottinghamshire and 100, in the drawn fourth Test at Headlingley. In the final Test, which England won to take the series, Hutton became the first man in Tests, and only the fourth in all first-class cricket, to be given out obstructing the field: he edged a ball in the air and legitimately knocked it away from his wickets with his bat; in doing so, he prevented a catch being taken and was given out. This remains the only such instance in Tests. Hutton ended the Test series with 378 runs at an average of 54.00. Late in the season, he scored a century against Gloucestershire to become the second Yorkshire player after Sutcliffe to complete centuries against the other 16 first-class counties.

==Captain of England==
===Appointment===

Brown&#x27;s resignation from the captaincy of England at the end of 1951 left no obvious replacement candidate. Traditionally, captains in county or Test cricket were amateurs, who usually came from privileged backgrounds, in contrast to professionals, who often came from the working classes. Consequently, class distinction pervaded cricket which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs, many of whom reasoned that professionals would not make good captains owing to their worries over safeguarding their contracts or concerns about affecting the livelihoods of other professionals. In 1952, the selectors judged that none of the serving amateur county captains possessed the required ability or experience to fill the role of England captain. Consequently, the selectors decided to radically depart from tradition and appoint a professional captain. All previous England captains in home Test matches had been amateurs, and no professional had captained England in any match in the 20th century. But, as widely anticipated by the press, Hutton was appointed to captain England in the first Test of a four-match series against the 1952 Indian tourists. He harboured private doubts whether the cricket establishment would accept a professional captain, but declined to turn amateur, as Wally Hammond had done in 1938. The decision met with broad approval from the press, and the editor of &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote: &quot;In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should mean that in future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side.&quot; Hutton had not expected to be asked and had thought an amateur would have been appointed as usual. He presumed his appointment was an interim measure until a more suitable candidate could be found.

Before his home crowd at Headingley, Hutton&#x27;s first match as captain was a success, although his tactics were cautious. The &quot;Wisden&quot; correspondent wrote: &quot;For Hutton the match was a personal triumph. Tradition had been broken ... and he must have known that the eyes of the world were upon him. He did not falter and his astute leadership earned him many admirers&quot;. England won comfortably, although Hutton failed with the bat. In the second Test, Hutton scored 150 out of a total of 537, and although cautious once more, the &quot;Wisden&quot; editor believed his captaincy helped to secure a win. Following this match, the selectors appointed Hutton captain for the rest of the series. In the final two Tests, Hutton scored 104 and 86 and his bowlers dominated the Indian batsmen. The drawn final Test was ruined by weather, but England won the four match series 3–0, and Hutton scored 399 runs at an average of 79.80; in the whole summer he scored 2,567 first-class runs at an average of 61.11 with eleven centuries.

===Ashes victory===

During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having held the Ashes since 1934 but critics considered England to have a good chance of winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia&#x27;s first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.

The fourth Test, in front of Hutton&#x27;s home crowd, was his least successful of the series. He was bowled second ball by a yorker from Lindwall and England struggled to remain competitive throughout the match. In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. Hutton used Trevor Bailey to bowl negatively and slow Australia down; his tactics, including time-wasting and the use of leg theory, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn. It is possible that the idea came from Bailey himself, but the Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity. In contrast, English critics believed the tactics were justified. Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia&#x27;s first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82. In reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners and England scored the necessary 132 runs to win their first series against Australia since 1932–33 and their first such home series win since 1926. &quot;Wisden&quot; praised Hutton&#x27;s strategy and tactical sense, and he was widely acclaimed in the press, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett, the Australian captain, maintained. Hutton scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37 in the Tests, but found it mentally tiring to lead England. Meanwhile, some Yorkshire observers felt he should do more to improve discipline at the county. In the whole summer, he scored 2,458 runs at an average of 63.02.

===Captain in the West Indies===
In the winter of 1953–54, Hutton led the MCC on a tour of West Indies. Before the team left England, critics queried his appointment, arguing that a professional captain was unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton&#x27;s authority was also compromised by the MCC, who did not give him the tour manager he requested; instead, they appointed the inexperienced Charles Palmer, the Leicestershire captain, who had already been selected as a player on the tour. Palmer&#x27;s dual role as player and manager blurred the lines of command. Hutton also found some of the professionals in the team to be difficult to lead, particularly Godfrey Evans, and Fred Trueman. Off-field events often overshadowed the cricket. Amid growing independence movements in the region, Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule. The situation was further inflamed as journalists and English residents in the Caribbean placed great emphasis on an English victory, and the perception was that the series would establish the unofficial world champions. The standards of local umpiring were a further source of controversy. The crowds often made noisy protests about on-field events, often related to umpiring. The climax came in the third Test when missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire judged Cliff McWatt was out; Hutton kept his team and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation. The attitude of some English players inflamed feelings, either through a perceived lack of courtesy, or their negative reactions to events on the field. Some critics held Hutton responsible for this, but the editor of &quot;Wisden&quot; later wrote: &quot;[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling—an experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless.&quot;

Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace, picking four fast bowlers for the first Test. In doing so, he misjudged the pitch; West Indies made a large score and won by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative leg theory bowling, outside leg stump. In the second Test, Hutton scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another defeat after losing his seventh consecutive toss in Tests. England batted slowly throughout; Hutton was himself barracked for his slow, defensive batting during the match. England won the third Test by nine wickets, their first victory in the Caribbean since 1935. Hutton, who finally won the toss, scored 169 in seven hours and West Indies were bowled out twice. After a drawn fourth Test, England had to win the final Test to draw the series. Hutton lost the toss but his bowlers dismissed West Indies cheaply in good batting conditions. Hutton then batted for almost nine hours to score 205, his nineteenth and final Test century. &quot;Wisden&quot; observed that &quot;For concentration and control, Hutton&#x27;s innings ... scarcely could have been excelled.&quot; The innings ended amid another controversy when local officials and journalists accused Hutton of snubbing the congratulations of the Chief Minister Alexander Bustamante during a tea interval. Hutton apologised, not having noticed Bustamante speaking to him, but was dismissed immediately when play resumed; the incident was prominently reported the following day. England&#x27;s bowlers bowled out West Indies a second time and England scored the required runs to record a series-levelling victory, West Indies&#x27; first defeat in Jamaica in a Test. In its summary of the tour, &quot;Wisden&quot; said that Hutton showed mastery over every bowler. The correspondent wrote, &quot;From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering the weight of his many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket&quot;. The press were generally supportive despite reservations over his caution. Swanton and Alan Gibson later credited England&#x27;s recovery in the series to Hutton&#x27;s batting and leadership. In five Tests, he scored 677 runs—his largest aggregate in a series—at an average of 96.71, the highest on either side. In all first-class matches, he made 780 runs at an average of 78.00.

===Appointment of Sheppard===
Hutton missed large parts of the 1954 season on medical advice, suffering from mental and physical exhaustion brought about by the West Indian tour. He played in the first Test against Pakistan, on their first tour of England, scored a duck and missed the next two matches. In Hutton&#x27;s absence, the selectors appointed the amateur David Sheppard, a theology student at the time; Sheppard achieved little batting success, but England won one of the two Tests in which he was captain. According to &quot;Wisden&quot; editor Norman Preston, influential figures within the cricket hierarchy blamed Hutton for the previous winter&#x27;s events and attempted to replace him as captain. Two former England cricketers, Errol Holmes and Walter Robins, the latter also a selector that year, favoured Sheppard over Hutton and persuaded him to offer his candidacy to captain the MCC in Australia that winter. Sheppard indicated he would accept the post and take a leave of absence from his studies if required. The press speculated that Hutton would step aside, but most newspapers favoured his continued leadership and ran stories alleging MCC prejudice against professional cricketers. Neither Hutton nor Sheppard publicly expressed an opinion, although Hutton informed the MCC he would tour Australia as captain or player as required, and both men remained on good personal terms throughout. Robins, seeing the strength of opinion, backed down. When Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the MCC for the winter tour. Returning to captain a slightly weakened team for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, and Pakistan recorded their first Test victory. In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs. Owing to his reduced appearances, Hutton failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs for the first time since 1936, reaching 912 runs at an average of 35.07.

===Captain in Australia===

Expectations before the Australian tour were low after the confusion of the 1954 summer and some controversial selections. Trueman, Jim Laker and Tony Lock, part of the winning 1953 team, were omitted; Colin Cowdrey and Vic Wilson were included. Hutton further downplayed his team&#x27;s chances through exaggerating its inexperience to the Australian press; newspapers were already sympathetic to Hutton as a professional captain of a class-driven country. The team began the tour well. Hutton made a series of good scores in the opening games. But for the first Test, Hutton did not include a spinner in the team and chose to bowl on winning the toss, an unusual strategy in Australia. The home side scored 601, England dropped 12 catches and, with the key players Evans and Compton injured, lost by an innings; the press blamed Hutton for choosing to bowl. Despite the result, Hutton saw potential in Frank Tyson&#x27;s bowling and arranged for Alf Gover, a respected coach who was in Australia as a journalist, to improve and shorten Tyson&#x27;s run to the wicket. For the second Test, Hutton left out the unfit Alec Bedser, England&#x27;s most reliable bowler since the war, to include two spinners, but in a low-scoring game, Tyson made the difference and England won by 38 runs. Hutton was unwell before the third Test, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold, and had to be persuaded out of bed by members of his team. He decided to play at the last minute and unexpectedly left out Bedser again, although he was fit to play. Hutton neglected to inform Bedser, who only learned of his omission when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match. Hutton contributed few runs, but Cowdrey and Peter May made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128-run victory. The fourth Test was crucial, and Hutton&#x27;s innings of 80 runs in four-and-a-half hours was the highest of the game. &quot;Wisden&quot; believed Hutton&#x27;s tactics were instrumental in giving his team the upper hand, and in the final innings, England needed 94 to win and retain the Ashes. Early wickets, including Hutton&#x27;s, fell to Miller, and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had &quot;done us again.&quot; Compton, the next man in, replied &quot;I haven&#x27;t been in yet&quot;, and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton&#x27;s reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton. England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out. This ended the series, which England won 3–1.

Hutton&#x27;s tactical approach in the series was praised by Australian and English commentators; they noted how Hutton observed his opponents carefully to spot weaknesses. His caution was criticised, but the main complaint was that he deliberately slowed the speed of play, reducing the number of overs bowled, allowing the fast bowlers to rest and restricting the rate at which Australia scored. With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44. In all first-class matches in Australia, he scored 959 runs at 50.47. The tour ended with two Tests in New Zealand; England won the first by eight wickets, and the second by an innings and 20 runs. New Zealand were bowled out for 26 in their second innings, which, in 2018, remains the lowest Test score. In the latter match, Hutton scored 53 batting at number five in his final Test innings. He had played in 79 Test matches, scoring 6,971 runs at an average of 56.67 with 19 hundreds. As England captain in 23 matches, he won eight Tests and lost four, and along with Percy Chapman was the only England captain to win consecutive series against Australia.

===Retirement===
On Hutton&#x27;s return to England, he was made an honorary member of the MCC, which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, a rare indication of confidence. After a poor start to the season, Hutton captained MCC against the tourists, but withdrew from the final day of the match with lumbago. His uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton played for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours, his final first-class century. His last 100 runs came in an hour. After the following match, his back was too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. In eleven first-class matches, he scored 537 runs at an average of 29.83. In June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. He was 39, an early retirement age for the period. He played one further match in 1957 for MCC against Lancashire, and two matches in 1960 for MCC and L. C. Stevens&#x27; XI. In all first-class cricket, he scored 40,140 runs at an average of 55.51 with 129 hundreds.

==Style and technique==

===Batting===
&quot;Wisden&quot; viewed Hutton, with Jack Hobbs, as &quot;one of the two most accomplished professional batsmen to have played for his country&quot;, and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world. In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time. As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England&#x27;s greatest team; The official Yorkshire history describes him as &quot;technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire&quot;. E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next. Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded. Cricket historian David Frith believes that &quot;there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship&quot;, and Alan Gibson described Hutton&#x27;s off drive as &quot;the glory of the game.&quot; He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches. Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton&#x27;s mental approach to both batting and captaincy, while Colin Cowdrey later said &quot;I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton ever since I started playing serious cricket.&quot; Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is ninth highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.

Hutton&#x27;s batting technique was orthodox and conventional. John Woodcock writes that he seemed to possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease. His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide his right foot back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the back foot, getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late. Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form. This arose mainly through the wartime injury to his arm and by 1950 he had adjusted his technique to compensate and had fewer problems. Immediately before the war, Hutton batted in a more attacking style and several of his contemporaries remembered his attractive strokeplay. By his own admission, Hutton was not the same player after the war. A combination of the effects of his injury and the responsibility of opening the batting in generally weak Yorkshire and England teams, whose success often depended on Hutton, meant that he batted cautiously. Hutton only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches. However, Patrick Murphy writes: &quot;Just now and again he would play an innings of genius, when bowlers could not contain him.&quot; One such innings was his score of 37 in the second Test of 1946–47 in which the attacking shots he played reminded older spectators of Victor Trumper, regarded as the ultimate Australian strokeplayer. In all his innings, he was expert at hitting the ball just out of the reach of fieldsmen to allow runs to be taken. Several of his contemporaries believed he did not get enough credit for surviving the short-pitched attacks of the Australian bowlers following the war.

===Captaincy===

As captain, Hutton believed that the key to success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down the game to allow the fast bowlers to rest, which set a precedent for other captains. Tactically, Norman Yardley found him &quot;sound rather than venturesome&quot;. Run saving was his main priority, but during matches, he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of particular batsmen. Jim Kilburn believed that Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, to the point where he missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the &quot;outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience.&quot;

Some of his selections as captain were widely debated. Following incidents in the Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton&#x27;s captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker&#x27;s commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker&#x27;s replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton found it hard to talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton played a key role in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton&#x27;s advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey&#x27;s father died during the tour.

Cricket followers from the south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him with the result that Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.

Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, except in the absence of the official captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton&#x27;s favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side&#x27;s senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county&#x27;s failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but &quot;he didn&#x27;t do anything about it&quot;. Illingworth recalled that he was a &quot;distant hero&quot;, saying: &quot;He was a funny man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He&#x27;d hear an argument in the dressing room and he&#x27;d throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner.&quot;

==Later life==
Hutton married Dorothy Mary Dennis, the sister of former Yorkshire cricketer Frank Dennis, on 16 September 1939 at Wykeham near Scarborough; they met at an end-of-season dance which Dorothy had attended with her brother. They had two sons: Richard, who later played cricket for Yorkshire and England, in 1942, and John in 1947.

During and after the war, Hutton worked for a paper manufacturer, but writing and journalism provided a more permanent career. Hutton worked with Thomas Moult, a journalist and writer, to produce a book of memoirs, &quot;Cricket is My Life&quot; in 1949, and he wrote for the &quot;News of the World&quot; while still playing. Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961, and after 1955, he wrote for the London &quot;Evening News&quot; until 1963. A second book, &quot;Just my story&quot;, followed in 1956 in collaboration with journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958–59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the MCC tour as correspondent for the &quot;Evening News&quot;, again assisted by a professional journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for &quot;The Observer&quot;. He wrote a third book, &quot;Thirty Years in Cricket&quot;, in 1984. Hutton&#x27;s increasing commitments in the south of England meant he moved to North London in 1959. In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner, mainly working in a public relations capacity. Later, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products, became a director of the firm in 1973, and retired in 1984.

Although he disliked committees, Hutton served as an England Test selector in 1975 and 1976, but business commitments limited his availability so he resigned in 1977. Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and became president of Yorkshire county cricket in January 1990. In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a ruptured aorta shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September.

<text>The Birkebein Party or Birkebeinar (; (nynorsk) or (bokmål)) was the name for a rebellious party in Norway, formed in 1174 around the pretender to the Norwegian throne, Eystein Meyla. The name has its origins in propaganda from the established party that the rebels were so poor that they made their shoes of birch bark. Although originally a pejorative, the opposition adopted the &quot;Birkebeiner&quot; name for themselves, and continued using it after they came to power in 1184.

Today, the Birkebeins are popularly celebrated for having escorted the one-year-old Haakon Haakonsson, an heir to the Norwegian throne, safely from Lillehammer to Østerdalen to Trondheim, a long and perilous journey through treacherous mountains and forests. This is commemorated through cross-country ski races, Birkebeinerrennet and Birkebeinerrittet.

==What is a Birkebeiner?==
The original meaning of Birkebeiner is “birch bark leggers.” 800 years ago, Norwegian warriors wrapped and tied birch bark around their legs as gaiters and armor. In later times – when birch bark was replaced with other materials – Birkebeiner came to mean “a person strong in adversity, never daunted by trial and hardships.”

==Background==
The Civil war era in Norway (&quot;borgerkrigstiden&quot;) is a term used for the period between 1130 and 1240 in the history of Norway. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. Although weak in the beginning, the Birkebeiners had the upper hand for most of the conflict&#x27;s duration. King Haakon IV was the ultimate victor for the Birkebeiners in 1217. In the earlier part of the reign of King Haakon, much of the royal power was in the hands of Skule Bårdsson. In 1239, the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare, when Skule had himself proclaimed king in Nidaros. The rebellion ended in 1240 when Skule was put to death.

The background for these conflicts was the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between Church and King. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensing into the parties of Bagler and Birkebeiners. The rallying point was regularly a royal son, who was set up as the figurehead of the party in question, to oppose the rule of the king from the contesting party.

==Formation==
The Birkebein party was formed of some earlier groups with the original goal of deposing king Magnus V of Norway (Magnus Erlingsson) and his father Earl Erling Skakke. From a socio-historical perspective, scholars have interpreted the party as the result of the rapid increase in landless &quot;markamenn&quot; (meaning &quot;border men&quot;), who settled along the Swedish border and made their living by pillaging the rich old settlements. It was this lawless population that became the foremost basis of the Birkebeiner, even though it is questionable whether their leaders were paupers wearing shoes made of birch bark.

Their leadership came from Trøndelag, a region where the social tensions were not as marked, and their motive was rather to stop the transition of power from Trøndelag to Viken and Vestlandet. The powerful Trønder families were simply being left behind by their peers in the south, who had acquired a strong leader in the Vestland earl Erling Skakke in the mid-12th century. In the early 1160s, Erling had taken control of Viken and the bishopric of Nidaros and had subsequently made his underage son Magnus Erlingsson the king of Norway. The party that was behind their rule was not called the Bagli party (Bagler) during their time, but only later. The rival forces against the Birkebeins were dubbed several names, successively Lendsmenn, Heklungs, Kuvlungs, Øyskjeggs and Bagler.

==The rise of Sverre==
After some initial victories for the Viken party, the tables turned when Sverre entered the political scene claiming to be the illegitimate son of king Sigurd Munn. Sverre sought assistance from the Swedish earl Birger Brosa who sent him Swedish forces after some hesitation. One of Birger Brosa&#x27;s sons, Philippus Birgersson, became Sverre&#x27;s earl.

Under Sverre&#x27;s leadership, the Birkebeiner movement was re-organized and pruned and the most criminal elements were brutally purged from the party. The army consisted more and more of mercenaries from Sweden and England. As early as 1177, Sverre was proclaimed king by his followers, but in reality his power did not extend beyond the borders of Trøndelag and it took two decisive battles in 1179 and 1184 before he could be formally elected king. By then, both the main opponents were dead, i.e., earl Erling (1179) and King Magnus Erlingsson (1184), and the opposition was greatly reduced.

The Birkebeiner&#x27;s political program was a continuation of earl Erling&#x27;s centralization which underscores the geographical motivations behind the movement. Their leadership did not seek a social revolution, only to move the centre of power back to Trøndelag. The opposition around Viken organized in 1196 into a new faction called the Bagler.

==1200 onwards==
Around the year 1200, the rival groups shared the goal of controlling the entire country. In 1202, when King Sverre died, he had managed to acquire most of Norway, but in Østerdalen, the Baglers were still very powerful. Sverre&#x27;s death meant some decrease in the power of the Birkebeins. His successor, King Haakon Sverresson, died only two years later, leaving his son Haakon Haakonsson as the ultimate target for the Baglers to get rid of the pretender to the throne. In 1206, the Birkebeiners set off on a dangerous journey through treacherous mountains and forests, taking the now one-year-old Haakon Haakonsson to safety in Trondheim. Norwegian history credits the Birkebeiners&#x27; bravery with preserving the life of the boy who later became King Haakon Haakonsson IV, ended the civil wars in 1240 and forever changing Northern Europe&#x27;s history through his reign. The events surrounding the journey are dramatised in &quot;The Last King&quot;.

The Birkebeins managed to hold some power, despite short reigns of their monarchs. In 1209, a resolution was made between Bagler and Birkebeiner. Bagler pretender Philip Simonsson was recognized as ruler of the eastern third of the country, Østlandet, without the title of king. Birkebeiner&#x27;s Inge Baardsson was recognized to be King of Norway. They both died in 1217 and Birkebeiner-born Haakon IV ascended the throne, relatively unopposed, under the regency of Duke Skule.

==Birkebeiner traditions==

The city arms of Lillehammer show a Birkebeiner skiing in honour of the historic rescue. The mascots Håkon and Kristin of the 1994 Winter Olympics are depicted as Birkebeiner children, bearing the names of the son and daughter of king Sverre. Near Drammen, the sports association Idrettsforeningen Birkebeineren took their name from the party.

==Birkebeiner Run==
Today, the historic event of the rescue of Haakon Haakonsson is honoured in Norway by three annual sporting events, a run, Birkebeinerløpet; a mountain bike race, Birkebeinerrittet; a cross-country ski race, Birkebeinerrennet and, beginning in 2012, Landeveisbirken, a road bicycle race. Common for the bike and ski events is the requirement of carrying a backpack weighing 3.5 kg as a remembrance of the child the Birkebeiners had to carry on their journey. The bike and ski events start in Rena and all three events finish in Lillehammer. There are also sister cross-country ski races held in Hayward Wisconsin (United States) (the American Birkebeiner), in Edmonton (Canada) (the Canadian Birkebeiner) and in Falls Creek (Australia).

<text>Slavic folklore encompasses the folklore of the Slavic peoples from their earliest records until today. Folklorists have published a variety of works focused specifically on the topic over the years.

There are few written records of pagan Slavic beliefs; research of the pre-Christian Slavic beliefs is challenging due to a stark class divide between nobility and peasantry who worshipped separate deities. Many Christian beliefs were later integrated and synthesized into Slavic folklore.

<text>For Your Eyes Only is a collection of short stories by Ian Fleming, and the eighth book to feature the fictional British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. It was first published by Jonathan Cape on 11 April 1960. It marked a change of approach for Fleming, who had previously only written Bond stories as full-length novels.

The collection comprises five short stories: &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;Risico&quot; and &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;. Three of the stories were adaptations of plots for a television series that was never filmed; Fleming had written the fifth previously but not published it. He undertook some minor experiments with the format, including one story written as an homage to W. Somerset Maugham, an author he greatly admired.

Reviews for the book were mixed, although several critics thought the short-story format suited Bond. Elements from the stories have been used in several Bond films, including the title of the 1981 film, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, starring Roger Moore as Bond. The film also used some elements and characters from the short stories &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;Risico&quot;. &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; also gave part of its title (but no characters or plot elements) to the 1985 film, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; and plot elements from &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot; were used in the 1989 film, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;. &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; was used as the title for the twenty-second Bond film in 2008.

==Plots==

===&quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; ===
The Secret Service agent James Bond investigates the murder of a motorcycle dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. As Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in any way he can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider; as expected, the assassin attempts to kill him. Bond is ready for him and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin&#x27;s underground base of operations.

===&quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; ===
The Havelocks, a British couple living in Jamaica, refuse to sell their estate to Herr von Hammerstein, a former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counter-intelligence for the Cuban secret service. They are murdered by two Cuban hit-men at the direction of their leader, Major Gonzales; all three work for Hammerstein. The Havelocks are close friends of M, who served as the best man during their wedding. M gives Bond a voluntary assignment, unconnected to sanctioned Secret Service duties, to travel to Vermont via Canada, find Hammerstein at his rented estate at Echo Lake and assassinate him as a warning to future criminals who might think to target British citizens. When Bond arrives on the scene, he finds the Havelocks&#x27; daughter, Judy, who intends to carry out her own mission of revenge with a bow and arrow. Judy kills Hammerstein by shooting him in the back with an arrow from away at the exact moment that he dives into a lake. A shoot-out then occurs between Bond and Gonzales and the two Cuban gunmen. Bond kills all of them and returns to Canada with Judy, who has been slightly wounded during the gunfight.

===&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; ===

After completing a mission in the Bahamas, Bond is in Nassau and attends a dinner party at Government House. When the other guests have left, Bond remarks that if he ever marries, he imagines it would be nice to marry an air hostess. The Governor then tells Bond the story of a relationship between the civil servant Philip Masters and the air hostess Rhoda Llewellyn. After meeting aboard a flight to London, the couple married, and went to live in Bermuda, but after a time Rhoda began a long open affair with the eldest son of a rich Bermudian family. As a result, Masters&#x27;s work deteriorated, and he suffered a nervous breakdown. After recovering, he was given a break from Bermuda by the governor and sent on an assignment to Washington. Upon his return Masters was determined to end his marriage and he divided their home into two sections, half to each of them and refused to have anything to do with his wife in private—although they continued to appear as a couple in public. He eventually returned to the UK alone, leaving Rhoda with unpaid debts and stranded in Bermuda—a cruel act which he would have been incapable of carrying out just a few months earlier. The governor explains his point to Bond: when the &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone and the relationship is finished. Despite the success of Masters&#x27;s plan to take revenge on his unfaithful wife, he never recovered emotionally. After a time, Rhoda married a rich Canadian. The governor then reveals that the dinner companions whom Bond found dull were Rhoda and her rich Canadian husband.

===&quot;Risico&quot; ===
Bond is sent by M to investigate a drug-smuggling operation based in Italy that is sending narcotics to England. M instructs Bond to get in touch with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo, he is captured and brought aboard Colombo&#x27;s ship, &quot;Colombina&quot;. Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation, and that Kristatos is backed by the Russians. Colombo agrees to help Bond by providing information about things &quot;as long as none of it comes back to Italy&quot;; Bond agrees to help Colombo eliminate Kristatos. Bond, Colombo and his men sail &quot;Colombina&quot; to Santa Maria when Kristatos&#x27;s men are loading another shipment of drugs. They attack Kristatos&#x27;s ship and adjacent warehouse and discover Kristatos lurking near the warehouse, preparing to detonate a bomb. Kristatos tries to escape, but is killed by Bond.

===&quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot; ===

Bond is on an assignment in the Seychelles; through Fidele Barbey, his influential and well-connected local contact, he meets an uncouth American millionaire, Milton Krest, who challenges the two to aid him in the search for a rare fish, the Hildebrand Rarity. Bond, Barbey, Krest and his English wife Elizabeth set off aboard Krest&#x27;s boat &quot;Wavekrest&quot; in search of the fish. During the journey, Bond learns that Krest verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, especially his wife—whom he punishes with the use of a stingray tail he dubs &quot;The Corrector&quot;. Krest finds the Hildebrand Rarity and kills it—along with many other fish—by pouring poison into the water. &quot;Wavekrest&quot; sets sail for port. Along the way Krest gets very drunk, insults Bond and Barbey and tells his wife he will beat her again with the stingray tail. Later that night, Bond hears Krest choking; investigating, Bond finds that Krest has been murdered—apparently by having the rare fish stuffed down his throat. So as not to be entangled in a murder investigation, Bond throws Krest overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime, making it look as though Krest fell overboard after one of the ropes holding his hammock broke: Bond suspects both Barbey and Mrs Krest, but is unsure which is responsible. When Mrs Krest invites Bond to sail with her to Mombasa—his next destination—aboard the &quot;Wavekrest&quot;, he accepts her invitation with reservations.

==Background and writing history==
In mid-1958 CBS television commissioned the author Ian Fleming to write episodes of a television show based on his Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; as an episode of the CBS television series &quot;Climax!&quot;. Fleming agreed to the deal and began to write outlines for the series, but CBS later dropped the idea.

By January 1959 Fleming had published six books in the preceding six years. A seventh book, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, was being edited and prepared for production; it was released at the end of March 1959. Once Fleming completed &quot;Goldfinger&quot; he thought he had exhausted his inspiration for plots. He told the writer William Plomer—his friend who proof-read all the Bond books—that the novel was to be &quot;the last full length folio on Bond ... Though I may be able to think up some episodes for him in the future, I shall never be able to give him 70,000 words again&quot;.

Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January 1959, where he adapted three of the CBS television plots into short stories and added a fifth he had written in the summer of 1958. Fleming&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lycett noted that at the time he was writing both the television scripts and the short story collection, &quot;Ian&#x27;s mood of weariness and self-doubt was beginning to affect his writing&quot;. 
&quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; was initially intended to be the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of the novel &quot;Moonraker&quot;. The story would have taken place during the Second World War, and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later, the hospital is bombed, leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face. The story was one that Fleming had drawn up for the television series. The original name for the story was &quot;The Rough with the Smooth&quot;, which was also the original title of the book, before &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; was chosen for publication. &quot;From A View to a Kill&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in September 1959 under the title &quot;Murder Before Breakfast&quot;.
For &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; Fleming contacted the Bond enthusiast and gun expert Geoffrey Boothroyd for research about bows and arrows, which Fleming felt would be better in the natural setting. Boothroyd had previously advised Fleming on the type of gun Bond should be carrying. Early names for &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; were &quot;Death Leaves an Echo&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;s Work&quot;. While it was still a possible television episode, it was to be called &quot;Rough Justice&quot;, which was to be episode three of the series.

&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; was based on a story told to Fleming by his neighbour and lover Blanche Blackwell about a real-life police inspector, whom Fleming turned into the story&#x27;s civil servant, Philip Masters. As thanks for the story, Fleming bought Blackwell a Cartier watch. Fleming wrote the story in the style of W. Somerset Maugham as an homage to a writer he greatly admired. An earlier title that was considered for &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; was &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot;. The story was first published in &quot;Modern Woman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in November 1959 under the title &quot;A Choice of Love and Hate&quot;.
The original manuscript copy for &quot;Risico&quot; is titled &quot;Risiko&quot;. The story was first published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in April 1960 under the name &quot;The Double-Take&quot;. This was adapted from another idea from the planned television series.
In April 1958 Fleming flew to the Seychelles via Bombay to report for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on a treasure hunt; although the hunt was not as exciting as he hoped, Fleming used many of the details of the island for &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;. Fleming combined the backdrop of the Seychelles with his and Blackwell&#x27;s earlier experience in Pedro Keys, two islands off Jamaica, where they watched two scientists do something similar with poison to obtain samples. For the villain of the story, an abusive American millionaire, Fleming used the name Milton Krest: Milton was the code name of a Greek sea captain who ferried British soldiers and agents through German patrols and who received the Distinguished Service Order and an MBE, while Krest was the name of tonic and ginger beer Fleming drank in Seychelles. &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot; was first published in &quot;Playboy&quot; in March 1960. It became the first magazine to publish a Bond short story; it began a long association between the publication and Bond. The story was also published in &quot;Today&quot; magazine in March 1960.

The collection &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; had two possible names before publication: &quot;The Rough with the Smooth&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;s Work&quot;; it was provisionally subtitled &quot;Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond&quot;. Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have identified timelines based on episodes and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor puts the events of all five episodes in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; between 1957 and 1958. Griswold provides more exact estimates and considers &quot;Risico&quot; to have taken place between 15 and 18 October 1957; &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; in February 1958; &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot; in April 1958; &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; in May 1958; and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; in September and October 1958.

==Development==

===Plot inspirations===

The underground hideout in &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; was inspired by Fleming&#x27;s brother Peter&#x27;s band of Auxiliary Units who dug tunnel networks in Britain in 1940 as part of a resistance movement in advance of a German invasion. The name of the secret service operative in Paris—Mary Ann Russell—is probably named after a former girlfriend, Maud Russell, according to Fleming&#x27;s bibliographer, Jon Gilbert.
&quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; was set in Vermont, where Fleming had spent a number of summers at his friend Ivar Bryce&#x27;s Black Hole Hollow Farm, which became the model for Hammerstein&#x27;s hideaway, Echo Lake. The name of the villain of the story, Hammerstein was taken from General Baron Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord (1878–1943), one of Hitler&#x27;s opponents. When Mrs Havelock says &quot;Somebody&#x27;s gone and bought that ghastly Blue Harbour hotel&quot;, Fleming is having a joke at the expense of his friend and neighbour Noël Coward, who had a house in Jamaica called Blue Harbour, not far from Fleming&#x27;s. The story&#x27;s name comes from a stamp used in the Naval Intelligence Division to show the classification of secret documents; Fleming was a member of the unit during the war. In October 1959 Fleming wrote to his publishers &quot;I rather like &#x27;For Your Eyes Only&#x27;. This used to be stamped on secret papers in the early days of the war and is still occasionally in use.&quot;
&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; takes its structure – an agent&#x27;s private conversation with a high-ranking diplomat about socially unequal romance – from Maugham&#x27;s short story &quot;&quot;. The story also provides a indication of the parlous state of Fleming&#x27;s own marriage at the time of writing.
&quot;Risico&quot; was inspired by Fleming&#x27;s love of Venice. In 1958 he holidayed with his wife Ann there and at the Lido island. Fleming was a great admirer of Thomas Mann&#x27;s work &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, which is set on the Lido, and the Flemings visited it for that reason. Fleming used the location as the backdrop for the story. For the love interest in the story, Lisl, Fleming used the name of an ex-girlfriend from Kitzbühel in Austria, where he had travelled in the 1930s. For Colombo&#x27;s name, Fleming borrowed the surname of Gioacchino Colombo, the Ferrari engine designer.
In addition to being inspired by his visit to the Seychelles in 1958, Fleming recalled a trip to two small islands off Jamaica he had made to observe a scientific expedition. He witnessed the scientists use the method of pouring poison into the water to obtain samples.

===Characters===

According to Raymond Benson—the author of the continuation Bond novels—two of the stories (&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; and &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;) are experimental in style for Fleming, while the remaining three are straightforward Bond adventures. In the two experimental stories Bond is given something of a more human side. In &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; Bond&#x27;s reaction to the Governor&#x27;s story shows a compassionate side, as he sees the real life of Philip Masters and Rhoda Llewellyn as being more dramatic than his recent mission; the forthcoming trip he has to make to the CIA, he now sees as &quot;dull and unexciting&quot;. In &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;, Bond is also shown with a humanitarian side, with feelings for the plight of Liz at the hands of her husband and for the use of the poison on the fish by Milton Krest.
The sociologist Anthony Synnott observes that &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; provides information about Bond&#x27;s moral code. With his stance against the evil that Hammerstein brings, Synnott sees Bond&#x27;s decision as that of an honourable man making a morally good verdict based on his own code of values. When accepting M&#x27;s request to take revenge for the murders of the Havelocks, Bond&#x27;s thoughts are outlined by Fleming:

There were no doubts in Bond&#x27;s mind. ... Hammerstein had operated the law of the jungle on two defenceless old people. Since no other law was available, the law of the jungle should be visited upon Hammerstein. In no other way could justice be done. If it was revenge, it was the revenge of the community.

An aspect of Bond&#x27;s relationship with M is shown in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;: Bond takes the decision from M&#x27;s shoulders about what should happen to the murderers the Havelocks; the scene also shows the reader about the weight of command and M&#x27;s indecision as to what path to follow. The daughter of M&#x27;s friends, Judy Havelock, is a tough and resourceful character, according to Benson, although after she has avenged her parents&#x27; death and is wounded, she softens and allows Bond to take up his usual role of protector.
In &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; the SHAPE head of security, Colonel Schreiber, is described as having &quot;the politely negative manner of a bank manager&quot; and is shown as the antithesis of Bond, according to the historian Jeremy Black. Fleming describes him with greying hair, sitting at a desk with silver framed photographs of his family and a single white rose; the lack of colour in the description reflects Schreiber&#x27;s lack of personality. The clash between the relaxed man of action (Bond) and an officious colleague was repeated in the 1962 short story &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.
The cultural critic Umberto Eco identifies the character of Enrico Colombo in &quot;Risico&quot; as an example of those characters who have morals closer to those of the traditional villains, but who act on the side of good in support of Bond; others of this type include Darko Kerim (&quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;), Tiger Tanaka (&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;) and Marc-Ange Draco (&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;).

==Style==

Within the &quot;James Bond&quot; series, Benson identifies what he described as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;, the use of &quot;hooks&quot; at the end of events to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. In &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; he sees the hooks being used to keep the pace of the story moving. The story, which he considers a morality tale, uses the flashback technique that Fleming liked.
The Fleming Sweep is also present in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, and helps the story move between the various locations. Benson sees the story structured in the same way as the novels: a murder at the beginning, Bond being instructed by M, the introduction of the female character which complicates the plot and then ending with the shoot-out at the end.

==Themes==
As it had in many of his previous works, the Second World War makes an appearance in some of the stories. Black observes that &quot;Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made ... [an] easy and obvious target for bad press.&quot; In &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Hammerstein is a former Gestapo officer, while the RCMP officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under Montgomery in the Eighth Army, Krest is of German descent and Colombo fought for the British in the war. Fleming&#x27;s prejudices against the Germans were summed up in &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;: &quot;The old Hun again. Always at your feet or at your throat&quot;.

Justice and revenge are themes that run through two of the stories. In &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; the idea of revenge is looked at from a number of angles: Bond&#x27;s, M&#x27;s and Judy Havelock&#x27;s, and each has a different interpretation. Bond&#x27;s approach to killing is also dissected in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, while the morality of killing—both with the mass poisoning of fish and the murder of Krest—is a theme in &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;.

The decline of Britain&#x27;s position in the world is observed and commented upon in several of the stories and was a subject which was of concern to Fleming. Krest, while drunk, tries to rile Bond:

Nowadays, said Mr Krest, there were only three powers—America, Russia and China. That as the big poker game and no other country had either the chips or the cards to come into it. Occasionally some pleasant little country—and he admitted they&#x27;d been pretty big league in the past—like England would be lent some money so that they could take a hand with the grown-ups.

Decline re-appears in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; with the ambassador, who has worked &quot;for thirty years while the Empire crumbled around him&quot;. In &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; the British residents in the colony of Jamaica are declining in number, either being bought out of their homes—being paid in United States dollars, rather than in sterling—or, like the Havelocks, being killed.

==Publication and reception==
===Publication history===
&quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; was published on 11 April 1960 in the UK as a hardcover edition by the publishers Jonathan Cape; it was 252 pages long and cost fifteen shillings. 21,712 copies were printed and quickly sold out. As he had done for many of Fleming&#x27;s other &quot;Bond&quot; novels, the artist Richard Chopping provided the cover art for a fee of 50 guineas. The picture was based on an idea by Fleming and the eye appearing on the cover is supposed to be that of Bond. &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; was published in the US in August 1960 by Viking Press and the subtitle was changed to &quot;Five Secret Exploits of James Bond&quot;; in later editions, the subtitle was dropped altogether.

In May 1962 Pan Books published a paperback version of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; in the UK that sold 226,000 copies before the end of the year and 441,000 in 1963. Since its initial publication the book has been re-issued in hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at 2025, has never been out of print.

===Critical reception===
Several reviewers thought the short story format suited Bond: Francis Iles wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the structure was &quot;better than the novels&quot;. One downside was that &quot;if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs&quot;, according to &quot;The Observer&quot; Maurice Richardson. The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; also felt for the female characters, the short form &quot;allows them only walk-on parts&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Listener&quot;, John Raymond said of the stories that &quot;all but one ... are well up to 007&#x27;s high standard&quot;; James Sandoe, in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, considered they had &quot;urban savagery and mighty smooth tale-spinning&quot;. Philip Stead for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; thought &quot;occasionally there seem to be echoes of &quot;&quot; and glimpses of &quot;Rogue Male&quot;, but the Bond ambience is persuasive&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Anthony Boucher considered that &quot;Bond&#x27;s triumphs are too simple and lack ... intricate suspense&quot;, while Violet Grant at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; thought &quot;Every one of the five long-short stories ... makes it plain that James Bond has served his purpose and should be allowed a decent death&quot;.

Some reviewers noted a new mood in Bond, with the critic for &quot;The Times&quot; considering the character had &quot;begun to have qualms&quot;; both Richardson and Raymond believed Bond was mellowing with age. The result, considered Richardson, was that Bond was &quot;less of a show-off&quot;. In &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Cyril Ray, writing under the pseudonym Christopher Pym, said that &quot;our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Four of the five short stories in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; were adapted into comic strips published in the British newspaper &quot;Daily Express&quot; and subsequently syndicated around the world. The first three stories were &quot;Risico&quot;, which ran between 3 April and 24 June 1961; &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;, which ran between 25 June and 9 September 1961; and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, which ran between 29 May and 16 December 1961. They were adapted by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky.

All three strips were published again in 2005 as part of the &quot;Dr. No&quot; anthology by Titan Books. The fourth adaptation, &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;, did not appear until six years after the comic-strip versions of the other stories and it ran between 29 May and 16 December 1967. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. This adaptation was reprinted by Titan Books in 2009 as part of Volume 2 of the &quot;James Bond Omnibus&quot; collection.
A number of details from the story &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; are used in the film of the same name, released in 1981 and starring Roger Moore as James Bond. The film shows the murder of the Havelocks—a marine archaeologist and his wife—by a hit-man, although it names the hit-man as Gonzalez, rather than Gonzales. The film also changes the name of the Havelocks&#x27; daughter, Judy, to Melina. &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; also uses much of the plot of &quot;Risico&quot;, including the characters of Colombo and Kristatos. Part of the title of the story &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; was used for the 1985 Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, although none of the story&#x27;s plot was used in the film. Milton Krest, his foundation, the &quot;Wavekrest&quot; and &quot;the Corrector&quot; were incorporated into the 1989 film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;. &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; was chosen as the title of the 22nd Bond film; none of the story was used for the film&#x27;s plot. In the 2015 film &quot;Spectre&quot;, M and Bond meet in a London safe house, which carries a name plate labelled &quot;Hildebrand Antiques and Rarities&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;.

<doc id="541461" wikidata="Q7811112" url="?curid=541461" title="To Serve and Protect">
<text>To Serve and Protect, also known as Under Arrest on streaming services, is a Canadian reality crime television series that shadows city police in Edmonton, Alberta, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Vancouver⁠, Penticton, New Westminster, Summerland, and Surrey, British Columbia. A few episodes venture to Las Vegas, and Memphis. The program premiered on KVOS-TV in 1993 using footage shot in 1991 and 1992. It is based on the American television series Cops.

==History==
The program was created by Dwayne Mitchell and Dan Forrer for KF Media Inc., debuting in 1993 on KVOS-TV in Bellingham, Washington. Most viewers of the hour-long program were located in the Vancouver, British Columbia region. Mitchell filmed five hundred &quot;ride alongs&quot; with the police in the program&#x27;s first two years. KVOS aired the program on Sunday nights in the 1990s and weeknights at midnight in the early 2000s. Among those featured on the program were future Edmonton Police whistleblower Derek Huff. With a new audience on Netflix, the program is today considered something of a camp classic for its dramatic characters and 1990s aesthetic. As of 2023, 26 episodes are available for streaming on Peacock.

After the first season, the Vancouver Police Department refused to allow the production company on ride alongs after they refused to blur the faces of suspects. Vancouver police constable Anne Drenan said Forrer&#x27;s &quot;negative attitude after police requested the show black out faces led to the police board deciding ... not to participate further.&quot; Drennan said police wanted to protect the identities of people who were arrested but not charged. The provincial government ruled that broadcasting a suspect&#x27;s face without their consent was illegal.

The original version of To Serve and Protect was canceled in 1995. Executive producer Dan Forrer blamed &quot;senior officers in the Vancouver police department and RCMP.&quot; The final episode featured footage that, according to Forrer, &quot;Vancouver police Chief Ray Canuel did want the public to see.&quot; He claimed the police chief wanted to &quot;kill the show&#x27;s access to ride alongs with officers in patrol cars because the original approval had been given by the previous police chief, Bill Marshall.&quot; Several instances of excessive force and illegal maneuvers were captured on film and aired as if routine. The new police chief was mortified to see the program showcase some of the brutal tactics routinely employed by his force, potentially casting them in a negative light.

Forrer and Mitchell secured access to other police departments and a new round of episodes were made starting in 1997. The RCMP of Surrey, British Columbia, was featured prominently. Located thirty minutes east of Vancouver, the suburb was famous for mullets, mustaches, and alcohol-related incidents. People have compared the area to Heavy Metal Parking Lot and the Trailer Park Boys. Some of the program&#x27;s most memorable moments occur during Surrey episodes, something that led to the Surrey City Council revoking permission to film within the city. The city council also contacted KVOS to pull all Surrey-based episodes from its rerun package. &quot;They are broadcasting the same incidents over and over, so people are getting the impression that this is still happening,&quot; said councillor Judy Villeneuve. She felt that the program unfairly portrayed Surrey as &quot;crime-ridden.&quot; Forrer was outraged. &quot;We are not going to acquiesce to the suggestion that we not show something – that&#x27;s ludicrous. If they are putting the screws to the police on To Serve and Protect, then what else are they telling them to do?&quot; However, the Surrey RCMP themselves were &quot;troubled about the show for months, and suspended participation last November [1997].&quot; The department didn&#x27;t cite specific concerns but said the program &quot;doesn&#x27;t present a balanced view of police work, but instead is skewed toward the more sensational incidents.&quot;

Forrer said the show was unrehearsed, but conceded that the program was formatted for maximum television impact. &quot;We just get in a police car and go wherever they are dispatched. I&#x27;m not saying that what we show is 100 per cent of reality but neither is what you see on BCTV News. There are people on the show two or three times, and they&#x27;re people who are always getting in trouble and causing us all a lot of grief. My sympathy for these people? There isn&#x27;t any ... It comes down to bleeding hearts and political correctness. They don&#x27;t like the fact that we embarrass or put some heat on some of these crooks that are on the show.&quot;

==Alternate Versions==

Dwayne Mitchell sold a syndicated, half-hour version of the program to American markets in 1997 under the title Mounties: True Stories of the Royal Canadian Police. It reportedly aired in eighty regional markets including Elko, Nevada, St. Joseph, Missouri, Salina, Kansas, Tucson, Arizona, West Palm Beach, Florida, and Agana, Guam. It generally aired around two in the morning. Forrer referred to his show as &quot;filler&quot; for the American market.

This show is available on the video-on-demand streaming services Netflix, Peacock, The Roku Channel, Pluto TV, Crackle, Tubi and Amazon Freevee (the version on the latter six services provided by FilmRise) under the title Under Arrest with episodes condensed from their original hour length to eight &quot;Best of&quot; seasons with each episode running 20 minutes.

<text>Hariprasad Chaurasia (born 1 July 1938) is an Indian music director and classical flautist, who plays the bansuri, in the Hindustani classical tradition.

==Early life==
Chaurasia was born in Allahabad (1938) (present day Prayagraj) in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. His mother died when he was six years old. He had to learn music without his father&#x27;s knowledge, as his father wanted him to become a wrestler. Chaurasia did go to the Akhada and trained with his father for some time, although he also started learning music and practising at his friend&#x27;s house.

He has stated, 
==Career==

Chaurasia started learning vocal music from his neighbour, Rajaram, at the age of 15. Later, he switched to playing the flute under the tutelage of Bholanath Prasanna of Varanasi for eight years. He joined the All India Radio, Cuttack, Odisha in 1957 and worked as a composer and performer. Much later, while working for All India Radio, he received guidance from the reclusive Annapurna Devi, daughter of Baba Allaudin Khan. She only agreed to teach him if he was willing to unlearn all that he had learnt until then. Another version is that she only agreed to teach him after he took the decision to switch from right-handed to left-handed playing to show her his commitment. In any case Chaurasia plays left-handed to this day.

Apart from classical music, Hariprasad has collaborated with Shivkumar Sharma, forming a group called Shiv-Hari. The pair composed music for many popular movies, including Silsila and Chandni, and created some highly popular songs. Chaurasia also collaborated with Bhubaneswar Mishra, forming the pair &quot;Bhuban-Hari&quot; (in line with Shiv-Hari), and the pair composed music for many Odia movies, creating numerous songs that were hugely popular in the state. These include Muje janena kaha baata (sung by Suman Kalyanpur; movie: Gapa helebi Sata); and all songs from Maa o Mamata, and many more.

Chaurasia&#x27;s nephew and pupil Rakesh Chaurasia is a highly accomplished flautist now, and has been performing globally with such eminent maestros as Zakir Hussain.

He serves as the artistic director of the World Music Department at the Rotterdam Music Conservatory in the Netherlands. He was also the founder of the Vrindavan Gurukul in Mumbai (opened 2006) and Vrindavan Gurukul in Bhubaneshwar (opened 2010). Both of these institutes are schools dedicated to training students in bansuri in the Guru-shishya tradition.

He has collaborated with several western musicians, including John McLaughlin, Jan Garbarek, and Ken Lauber, and has composed music for Indian films. Chaurasia also played on The Beatles&#x27; 1968 B-side &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, which was written by George Harrison. He also played with George Harrison on his first solo release, &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot;, and with Harrison, Ravi Shankar and others on the Dark Horse Records release &quot;Shankar Family &amp; Friends&quot;.

==Personal life==
Chaurasia has married twice, first to Kamala Devi and then Anuradha Roy. He has three sons. With first wife Kamala Devi he has two sons, Vinay and Ajay. With Anuradha, Chaurasia has a son named Rajeev. Chaurasia has five granddaughters and a grandson. His nephew Rakesh Chaurasia is also a flautist and carrying forward the family legacy.

==In popular culture==
The 2013 documentary film &quot;Bansuri Guru&quot; features the life and legacy of Chaurasia and was directed by the musician&#x27;s son Rajeev Chaurasia and produced by the Films Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India.

<doc id="541469" wikidata="Q960389" url="?curid=541469" title="Bansuri">
<text>A bansuri is an ancient side-blown bamboo flute originating from Indian Subcontinent. It is an aerophone produced from bamboo and metal like material used in many Indian and Nepali Lok songs. A &quot;bansuri&quot; is traditionally made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with seven finger holes. Some modern designs come in ivory, fiberglass and various metals. The six hole instrument covers two and a half octaves of music. The &quot;bansuri&quot; is typically between in length, and the thickness of a human thumb. One end is closed, and few centimeters from the closed end is its blow hole. Longer &quot;bansuris&quot; feature deeper tones and lower pitches. The traditional design features no mechanical keys, and the musician creates the notes they want by covering and uncovering the various finger holes.

The &quot;bansuri&quot;-like flute is depicted in ancient Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temple paintings and reliefs, and is common in the iconography of the Hindu god Krishna. It is intimately linked to the love story of Krishna and Radha. The bansuri is revered as Lord Krishna&#x27;s divine instrument and is often associated with Krishna&#x27;s Rasa lila dance. These legends sometimes use alternate names for this wind instrument, such as the &quot;murali&quot;. However, the instrument is also common among other traditions such as Shaivism. The early medieval Indian texts also refer to it as &quot;vaṃśi&quot;, while in medieval Indonesian Hindu and Buddhist arts, as well as temple carvings in Java and Bali dated to be from pre-10th century period, this transverse flute has been called &quot;wangsi&quot; or &quot;bangsi&quot;.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word bansuri originates in the &quot;bans&quot; (बाँस) [bamboo] + &quot;sur&quot; (सुर) [melody]. A phonetically similar name for the same instrument, in early medieval texts, is the Sanskrit word &quot;vaṃśi&quot; which is derived from root &quot;vaṃśa&quot; (Sanskrit: वंश) meaning bamboo. A flute player in these medieval texts is called &quot;vamsika&quot;.

Other regional names of -style, six to eight play holes, bamboo flutes in India include , baashi, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The instrument is also used in Nepal, under the name Bām̐surī (बाँसुरी). Nepalese also use the word murli (मुरली), but that word can mean not only flute or fife, but also a reed instrument.

Ancient regional innovations, such as those in the Himalayan foothills of India, developed more complex designs, such as the which is a &quot;twin bansuri&quot; in different keys constructed as a single instrument, allowing the musician to play more complex music. In central and south India, a similar innovation is called or , and Buddhist stupa reliefs in central India, from about the 1st century BCE, depict the single and twinned flute designs.

==History==
According to Ardal Powell, flute is a simple instrument found in numerous ancient cultures. According to legends the three birthplaces of flutes are Egypt, Greece, and India. Of these, the transverse flute (side blown) appeared only in ancient India, while the fipple flutes are found in all three. It is likely, states Powell, that the modern Indian &quot;bansuri&quot; has not changed much since the early medieval era. However, a flute of a somewhat different design is evidenced in ancient China (&quot;dizi&quot;) which Powell, quoting Curt Sachs&#x27; &quot;The History of Musical Instruments&quot;, suggests may not have originated in China but evolved from a more ancient Central Asian flute design. It is, however, not clear whether there was any connection between the Indian and Chinese varieties.

The early medieval Indian &quot;bansuri&quot; was, however, influential. Its size, style, bindings, mounts on ends and playing style in medieval Europe artworks has led scholars, such as Liane Ehlich, a flute scholar at the music school in the University of Lucerne, to state that the &quot;bansuri&quot; (&quot;venu&quot;) migrated from India into the Byzantine Empire by the 10th century and from there on to medieval Europe where it became popular.
The flute is discussed as an important musical instrument in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; (~200 BCE to 200 CE), the classic Sanskrit text on music and performance arts. The flute (Venu or Vamsa) is mentioned in many Hindu texts on music and singing, as complementary to the human voice and Veena (vaani-veena-venu). The flute is however not called &quot;bansuri&quot; in the ancient, and is referred to by other names such as &quot;nadi&quot;, &quot;tunava&quot; in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (3000–2500 BCE) and other Vedic texts of Hinduism, or as &quot;venu&quot; in post-Vedic texts. The flute is also mentioned in various Upanishads and Yoga texts.

According to Bruno Nettl, a music historian and ethnomusicologist, the ancient surviving sculptures and paintings in the temples and archaeological sites of India predominantly show transverse flutes being played horizontally (with a downward tilt). However, beginning in the 15th century, vertical end blowing style are commonly represented. This change in the relevance and style of &quot;bansuri&quot; is likely, states Nettl, because of the arrival of Islamic rule era on the Indian subcontinent and the West Asian influence on North Indian music.

==Construction==

A bansuri is traditionally produced from a special type of bamboo, that naturally grows to long lengths between its nodes (knots). These grow abundantly in Himalayan foothills up to about 11,000 feet with high rainfall. These are particularly found in the northeastern (near Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura) and Western Ghats (near Kerala) states of India where numerous bamboo species grow with internodal lengths greater than .

The harvested bamboo with a desired diameter is cut, dried and treated with natural oils and resins to strengthen it. Once ready, the artisans examine the smoothness and straightness and measure the dried hollow tube. They mark the exact positions for the holes, then use hot metal rod skewers of different diameters to burn in the holes. Drilling and other methods of hole making are avoided as it is believed they damage the fiber orientation and the splits affect the music quality. The burnt-in holes are then finished by sanding, one end plugged, the flute ringed at various positions to stabilize its form and shape over time and the unit tested for its musical performance. The distance of a finger-hole from the mouth-hole, and the diameter of the finger-hole controls the note it plays. Adjustments to the diameters of various holes is made by the artisans to achieve purity of the musical notes produced. The wall thickness of the &quot;bansuri&quot; determines the tone, range and octave tuning. Once all the holes have reached their performance range, the &quot;bansuri&quot; is steeped in natural oils, cleaned, dried and decorated or bound with silk or nylon threads.

There are two varieties of bansuri: transverse and fipple. The fipple flute is usually played in folk music and is held at the lips like a tin whistle. Because the transverse variety enables superior control, variations and embellishments, it is preferred in Indian classical music.

===Musical notes===
Six holes are sufficient to produce seven basic &quot;swaras&quot;: &quot;sa&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, &quot;ga&quot;, &quot;ma&quot;, &quot;pa&quot;, &quot;dha&quot;, and &quot;ni&quot;. When all holes are closed, it produces the bass scale that is the root note of the &quot;bansuri&quot; (&quot;pa&quot;). With one hole farthest from the closed end of the &quot;bansuri&quot; open, the instrument plays the &quot;dha&quot;. Similarly, &quot;ni&quot; is produced with two farthest holes open, &quot;sa&quot; with three farthest open, &quot;re&quot; with four, &quot;ga&quot; with five, and &quot;ma&quot; is produced with all holes open.
Every &quot;bansuri&quot; by its design and construction has a specific key and tonal center, corresponding to &quot;sa&quot; (&quot;shadja&quot;, natural tonic) of the &quot;swara&quot; scale. This key is achieved by variations in length, inner diameter of the instrument and the relative size and placement of the finger holes. This allows the musician to select a &quot;bansuri&quot; constructed in the key of the music they want to create and share.

==Playing==
A &quot;bansuri&quot; is typically held horizontally slanting downwards towards right by the bansuri player. The index, middle and ring fingers of the right hand cover the outer fingerholes, while the same fingers of the left hand cover the rest. The &quot;bansuri&quot; is supported by the thumb and little finger, while the airhole is positioned near the lips and air blown over it at various speeds to reach the desired octave. For the seven-hole bansuri, the little finger (pinky) of the right hand is usually employed.
As with other air-reed wind instruments, the sound of a bansuri is generated from resonance of the air column inside it. The length of this column is varied by closing or leaving open, a varying number of holes. Half-holing is employed to play flat or minor notes. The &#x27;sa&#x27; (on the Indian sargam scale, or equivalent &#x27;do&#x27; on the octave) note is obtained by covering the first three holes from the blowing-hole. Octaves are varied by manipulating one&#x27;s embouchure and controlling the blowing strength. Either finger tips or finger pads are used by &quot;bansuri&quot; players to partially or fully cover the tap holes.

In order to play the diatonic scale on a bansuri, one needs to find where the notes lie. For example, in a bansuri where Sa or the tonic is always played by closing the first three holes, is equivalent to C, one can play sheet music by creating a finger notation that corresponds to different notes. A flutist is able to perform complex facets of Raga music such as microtonal inflections, ornamentation, and glissando by varying the breath, performing fast and dexterous fingering, and closing/opening the holes with slow, sweeping gestures.

<doc id="541471" wikidata="Q1729714" url="?curid=541471" title="San Saba, Rome">
<text>San Saba is an ancient basilica church in Rome, Italy. It lies on the so-called &quot;Piccolo Aventino&quot;, which is an area close to the ancient Aurelian Walls next to the Aventine Hill and Caelian Hill.

The current Cardinal Deacon of the &quot;Titulus S. Sabae&quot; is Arthur Roche, succeeding Jorge Medina. Both served as prefects of the Dicastery of Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments at the time of their elevation. The church was made parochial in 1931 and entrusted to the care of the Society of Jesus. It was established as a titulus in 1959.

==History==
According to legend, St. Silvia, mother of Pope Gregory I, had an estate at the site. After her death, so legend reads, her estate was transformed into an affiliate monastery of St. Andreas, the monastery which Gregory I founded at the site of today&#x27;s San Gregorio al Celio. This legend, however, can be traced back only to the 12th century, when in context of &quot;Renovatio Romae&quot; and Church Reform, the monastery of San Saba was meant to be provided with a long and impressive local tradition.

An alternate theory suggests a connection with a hospice for pilgrims founded by Gregory on land that belonged to his family. 

The historic origin of the religious site goes back to around 645. In this year, fugitive monks from the monastery of St. Sabas (Mar Saba, Palestine), who had fled their home country after the Islamic invasion, came to Rome to attend the Lateran Council. After the council, these Sabaite monks settled down in an old &quot;domus&quot; (=noble estate) on the &quot;Piccolo Aventino&quot; (the smaller crest of the Aventine hill, which at this time was deserted due to the big decrease in Rome&#x27;s population. Here, they founded an eremitic cell. The Sabaites introduced the cult of St. Sabas to Rome. In ancient sources, their monastery however goes by the name &quot;cellas novas&quot; or &quot;cellaenovae&quot;, which refers to the &quot;cellae&quot; (=cells) of their mother abbey, Mar Saba.
The Sabaite monastery prospered quickly and for a long time. In the 8th and 9th centuries, San Saba was one of the most prestigious of Rome and among the leading &quot;Greek&quot; monasteries. It received rich papal donations. Since 680, its abbots held important diplomatic roles in the relationships between Rome and Byzantium, and represented the Roman Church and Pope at several church councils in Constantinople.

In 768, Antipope Constantine II was held prisoner in this monastery, before being killed by the Lombards. 

The Benedictine monks of Monte Cassino received the church after it was rebuilt in the 10th century. Anselm, the nephew of St Anselm, was one of its abbots before departing to England as a papal legate. After many years of decay, the basilica was completely renovated in the 13th century, after being ceded to Cluniac monks in 1144. 

In 1463, Pope Pius II granted his nephew, Cardinal Francesco Todeschini the monastery of San Saba &quot;in commendam&quot;. The cardinal, who adopted his uncle&#x27;s family name &quot;Piccolomini&quot;, immediately began extensive restoration, construction, and decoration works on the ancient buildings. He added the loggia to the facade, and a fresco depicting the &quot;Annunciation&quot;.

In 1503 the Cistercians were entrusted with the church, which in 1573 was conveyed to the Jesuits (and their German seminary Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum).

== Description ==

The church, preceded by a small porch from the 13th century, has a nave with two aisles. These end with three apses. The interior is characterized by numerous interventions from different ages. The columns are from ancient buildings, and the floor is an example of Cosmatesque marble art from the beginning of the 13th century. 

The main artpieces are the notable frescoes that were discovered on the lower church which is close to the public. Fragments of those frescoes, most of which are very small, were detached and are now exhibited on the walls of the coridors leading to the church. On the left side of the lower church were depicted scenes from the life of Christ; on the right, scenes from the life of Mary. They represent the first instance of this Marian subject matter in any church in western Europe. The wall paintings were dated 
to the first half of the eighth century. Egyptian blue and lapis lazuli have been detected mixed together within the same pictorial layer. These are the oldest western paintings where lapis lazuli has been used as a blue pigment. 

The crypt, built on the house of St. Silvia, holds the relics of St. Sabas. The sacristy houses a fragment of fresco from the first church (8th century).

==Cardinal-deacons==
In 1959, San Saba was made a titular church, to be held by a cardinal-deacon.

<doc id="541488" wikidata="Q321458" url="?curid=541488" title="Sun tanning">
<text>Sun tanning or tanning is the process whereby skin color is darkened or tanned. It is most often a result of exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or from artificial sources, such as a tanning lamp found in indoor tanning beds. People who deliberately tan their skin by exposure to the sun engage in a passive recreational activity of sun bathing. Some people use chemical products that can produce a tanning effect without exposure to ultraviolet radiation, known as sunless tanning.

== Impact on skin health ==
===Moderate exposure===

Moderate exposure to direct sunlight contributes to the production of melanin and vitamin D by the body.

===Excessive exposure===
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays has negative health effects, including sunburn. Some people tan or sunburn more easily than others. This may be the result of different skin types and natural skin color, and these may be a result of genetics. The term &quot;tanning&quot; has a cultural origin, arising from the color tan. Its origin lies in the Western culture of Europe when it became fashionable for young women to seek a less pale complexion (see Cultural history below).

====Long-term====

Excessive exposure may in the long-term increase the risk of skin cancer, as well as depressed immune system function and accelerated aging of the skin.

==Tanning process==
Melanin is a natural pigment produced by cells called melanocytes in a process called melanogenesis. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin: pheomelanin (red) and eumelanin (very dark brown). Melanin protects the body by absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Excessive UV radiation causes sunburn along with other direct and indirect DNA damage to the skin, and the body naturally combats and seeks to repair the damage and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin&#x27;s cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens. The tanning process can be triggered by natural sunlight or by artificial UV radiation, which can be delivered in frequencies of UVA, UVB, or a combination of both. The intensity is commonly measured by the UV Index.

There are two different mechanisms involved in the production of a tan by UV exposure: Firstly, UVA radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidizes existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin. UVA may also cause melanin to be redistributed (released from melanocytes where it is already stored), but its total quantity is unchanged. Skin darkening from UVA exposure does not lead to significantly increased production of melanin or protection against sunburn. In the second process, triggered primarily by UVB, there is an increase in production of melanin (melanogenesis), which is the body&#x27;s reaction to direct DNA photodamage (formation of pyrimidine dimers) from UV radiation. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning, and typically becomes visible two or three days after exposure. The tan that is created by increased melanogenesis typically lasts for a few weeks or months, much longer than the tan that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV skin damage and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. Typically, it can provide a modest Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to 3 times the UV exposure as pale skin. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UVB exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UVB). The ultraviolet frequencies responsible for tanning are often divided into the UVA and UVB ranges.

===UVA===
Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation is in the wavelength range 320 to 400 nm.

===UVB===
Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is in the wavelength range 280 to 320 nm. Much of this band is blocked by the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer, but some penetrates. UVB:

* triggers the formation of CPD-DNA damage (direct DNA damage), which in turn induces an increased melanin production.
* is more likely to cause a sunburn than UVA as a result of overexposure. The mechanism for sunburn and increased melanogenesis is identical. Both are caused by the direct DNA damage (formation of CPDs).
* produces Vitamin D in human skin.
* is reduced by virtually all sunscreens in accordance with their SPF.
* is thought, but not proven, to cause the formation of moles and some types of skin cancer.
* stimulates the production of new melanin, which leads to an increase in the dark-colored pigment within a few days.

==Tanning behavior of different skin colors==
A person&#x27;s natural skin color affects their reaction to exposure to sunlight. An individual&#x27;s natural skin color can vary from a dark brown to a nearly colorless pigmentation, which may appear white. In 1975, Harvard dermatologist Thomas B. Fitzpatrick devised the Fitzpatrick scale to describe the common tanning behavior of various skin types, as follows: 

Dark skin does provide some protection against the sun’s ultraviolet rays, but people with dark skin are still subject to photoaging and melanoma.

==Health aspects==

The most common risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation is sunburn, the speed and severity of which vary among individuals. This can be alleviated at least to some extent by the prior application of a suitable-strength sunscreen, which also hinders the tanning process due to the blocking of UV light. Overexposure to ultraviolet radiation is known to cause skin cancer, make skin age and wrinkle faster, mutate DNA, and impair the immune system. Frequent tanning bed use triples the risk of developing melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, according to a 2010 study. The study suggests that the melanoma risk is linked more closely to total exposure than it is to the age at which an individual first uses a tanning bed. Frequent tanning also has behavioural reinforcing effects, following UVA radiation epidermal keratinocytes synthesize POMC inducing the production of β-Endorphins, which are opioid agonists. An opioid blockade also then causes withdrawal signs after habitual UV exposure leading to many tanners meeting the DSM-IV criteria for addiction. Several organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American Cancer Society and the US Surgeon General have issued guidelines warning about sun tanning and UV radiation exposure, either from the sun or from indoor tanning. Production of vitamin D is essential for human health. Moderate exposure (avoiding sunburn) to UV radiation provides benefits such as increased vitamin D, as well as other possible benefits that are still being studied. Several tanning activators have used different forms of psoralen, which are known to be photocarcinogenic. Health authorities have banned psoralen since July 1996.

==Cultural history==

In the United States and Western Europe before the 1920s, tanned skin was associated with the lower classes because they worked outdoors and were exposed to the sunlight. Parasols and long sleeves were typically worn, even at beaches. By the 1920s, however, a cultural transformation took place, and tan skin became the ideal.

By the early 20th century, therapeutic benefits of sunlight were advertised to the public. In 1903, Niels Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his &quot;Finsen Light Therapy&quot;. The therapy was a cure for diseases such as lupus vulgaris and rickets. Vitamin D deficiency was found to be a cause of rickets, and exposure to sunlight would allow vitamin D to be produced in a person. Therefore, sunlight exposure was a remedy to curing several diseases, especially rickets.
In 1910 a scientific expedition went to the island of Tenerife to test the wider health benefits of &quot;heliotherapy&quot;, and by 1913 &quot;sunbathing&quot; was referred to as a desirable activity for the leisured class. Shortly thereafter, in the 1920s, fashion-designer Coco Chanel accidentally got sunburnt while visiting the French Riviera. When she arrived home, she arrived with a sun tan and her fans apparently liked the look and started to adopt darker skin tones themselves. Tanned skin became a trend partly because of Coco&#x27;s status and the longing for her lifestyle by other members of society. In addition, Parisians fell in love with Josephine Baker, a &quot;caramel-skinned&quot; singer in Paris, and idolized her darker skin. These two women were leading figures of the transformation that tan skin underwent, in which it became perceived as fashionable, healthy, and luxurious. Jean Patou capitalized on the new tanning fad, launching the first sun tan oil &quot;Huile de Chaldee&quot; in 1927. Just before the 1930s, sunlight therapy became a popularly subscribed cure for almost every ailment from simple fatigue to tuberculosis. In the 1940s, advertisements encouraging sunbathing began to appear in women&#x27;s magazines. At the same time, swimsuits&#x27; skin coverage began decreasing, with the bikini radically changing swimsuit style after it made its appearance in 1946. In the 1950s, baby oil was commonly used to increase tanning.
Coppertone, in 1953, marketed its sunscreen with a drawing of a young girl and her cocker spaniel tugging on her bathing suit bottom, revealing her bare bottom and tan line; this advertisement was modified around the turn of the 21st century and now shows a little girl wearing a one-piece bathing suit or shorts. In the latter part of the 1950s, silver metallic reflectors were common to enhance one&#x27;s tan. In 1962, sunscreen commenced to be SPF rated, although SPF labeling in the US was not standardized by the FDA until 1978. In the 1970s, Mattel introduced Malibu Barbie, which had tanned skin and further popularized sun tanning among women.

In 1978, both sunscreen with an SPF 15 rating as well as tanning beds first appeared. In 2007, there were an estimated 50,000 outlets for indoor tanning; it was a five-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and had spawned an auxiliary industry for indoor tanning lotions including bronzers, intensifiers, and accelerators. Since then, the indoor tanning industry has become more constrained by health regulations. In China, darker skin is still considered by many to be the mark of the lower classes. As recently as 2012, in some parts of China, ski masks were becoming popular items to wear at the beach in order to protect the wearer&#x27;s face from the effects of sunlight. A 1969 innovation is tan-through swimwear, which uses fabric perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which transmit enough sunlight to approach an all-over tan, especially if the fabric is stretched taut. Tan-through swimwear typically allows more than one-third of UV rays to pass through (equivalent to SPF 3 or less), and an application of sunscreen even to the covered area is recommended.

==Sunless tanning==
To avoid exposure to UVB and UVA rays, or in seasons without strong sunshine, some people take alternative steps to appear with darkened skin. They may use sunless tanning (also known as self-tanners); stainers that are based on dihydroxyacetone (DHA); or cosmetics such as bronzers. Many sunless tanning products are available in the form of darkening creams, gels, lotions, and sprays that are self-applied on the skin. There is also a professional spray-on tanning option or &quot;tanning booth&quot; that is offered by spas, salons, and tanning businesses. Spray tanning does not involve a color being sprayed on the body, instead it uses a colorless chemical that reacts with proteins in the top layer of the skin, resulting in a brown color.

<text>The German Institute of Science and Technology – TUM Asia is an institute for research and education located in Singapore, formed in 2002 as the Asian campus of the Technical University of Munich.

== Background ==
GIST-TUM Asia was set up in Singapore in 2002, under the Singapore government&#x27;s Global Schoolhouse Initiative. GIST-TUM Asia currently offers 5 Master of Science programmes, MSc in Industrial Chemistry; MSc in Integrated Circuit Design; MSc in Green Electronics; MSc in Aerospace Engineering; and MSc in Transport and Logistics. The former three programmes are run jointly with either Nanyang Technological University (NTU) or National University of Singapore (NUS) and the latter two programmes are pure TUM programmes.

GIST-TUM Asia then partnered Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) to offer Bachelor of Science programmes in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology and Chemical Engineering in 2010. Admitted students undergo a 2 ½ year programme that includes a 2 to 4 month overseas exchange at the Munich campus.

In 2020, TUM deepened their partnership with SIT and change the Electrical Engineering Program and Chemical Engineering Program into 4 years Bachelor of Engineering with Honours.

&quot;TUM CREATE&quot;, a research initiative by GIST-TUM Asia, was incepted in June 2010 to propagate research programmes where scientists and researchers from both Germany and Singapore can work together for the advancement of science and technology. With the research agreement in TUM CREATE Centre for Electromobility in Megacities sealed between GIST-TUM Asia and National Research Foundation of Singapore (NRF), the research programme will focus on developing innovative systems that incorporate safety and reliability with functionality and energy efficiency in electric vehicles.

<text>The Games is a 1970 British sports drama film directed by Michael Winner. It is based on the 1968 Hugh Atkinson novel and adapted to the screen by Erich Segal. The plot concerned four marathon competitors at a fictitious Olympic Games in Rome, played by Michael Crawford, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Charles Aznavour and Athol Compton. Elton John recorded one song (&quot;From Denver To L.A.&quot;) for the soundtrack.

==Plot==
American athlete Scott Reynolds, British athlete Harry Hayes, Czechoslovak athlete Pavel Vendek, and Indigenous Australian athlete Sunny Pintubi train for the Rome Olympics marathon.

==Cast==
* Michael Crawford as Harry Hayes, British competitor
* Ryan O&#x27;Neal as Scott Reynolds, American competitor
* Charles Aznavour as Pavel Vendek, Czechoslovak competitor 
* Jeremy Kemp as Jim Harcourt 
* Elaine Taylor as Christine 
* Stanley Baker as Bill Oliver 
* Athol Compton as Sunny Pintubi, Australian competitor 
* Rafer Johnson, Ron Pickering &amp; Adrian Metcalfe as Commentators 
* Kent Smith as Kaverley 
* Sam Elliott as Richie Robinson 
* Mona Washbourne as Mrs. Hayes 
* Reg Lye as Gilmour 
* June Jago as Mae Harcourt 
* Don Newsome as Cal Wood
* Slim de Grey as Hunt Driver

==Production==
Athol Compton was an Aboriginal Australian postman who had never acted before being cast in the film.

To simulate vast crowds of people, thousands of life-sized dummies were placed in the stadium&#x27;s seats in Rome&#x27;s Olympic stadium.

==Reception==
According to Fox records, the film required $7,500,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $2,825,000, meaning a loss to the studio.

Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that &quot;this beautifully scenic and perceptive drama, centering on four marathon contestants at the Rome Olympiad, is a nice antidote for the hot weather. The real star of the picture is Michael Winner, who has directed some previous British exercises with brisk adroitness and stamps this unstartling but engrossing eyeful with the same visual appeal.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; opined that &quot;with the outdated polemics of director Michael Winner, the banalities of Erich Segal&#x27;s adaptation of a Hugh Atkinson novel, and a rather lifeless and cardboard cast, the 20th-Fox release amounts to a dull Frank Merriwell yarn, hyped a bit to the level of high-school mentality.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;If Erich Segal&#x27;s screenplay had its tongue in its cheek, the four stories could be dismissed as comedy of stereotypes.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;what strikes you about &#x27;The Games&#x27; is what is such beautiful scenery doing in a dumb script like this?&quot; He elaborated that the screenplay contained &quot;almost every cliche known to sports.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; commented, &quot;A cliché-ridden script with much high-flown dialogue and the kind of flashy shooting one has come to expect from Michael Winner (all staccato cutting and ugly zooms) make it difficult to work up much interest in the fate of the four protagonists of &quot;The Games&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="541496" wikidata="Q383791" url="?curid=541496" title="Cut-through switching">
<text>In computer networking, cut-through switching, also called cut-through forwarding is a method for packet switching systems, wherein the switch starts forwarding a frame (or packet) before the whole frame has been received, normally as soon as the destination address and outgoing interface is determined. Compared to store and forward, this technique reduces latency through the switch and relies on the destination devices for error handling. Pure cut-through switching is only possible when the speed of the outgoing interface is at least equal or higher than the incoming interface speed.

Adaptive switching dynamically selects between cut-through and store and forward behaviors based on current network conditions.

Cut-through switching is closely associated with wormhole switching.

==Use in Ethernet==

When cut-through switching is used in Ethernet the switch is not able to verify the integrity of an incoming frame before forwarding it.

The technology was developed by Kalpana, the company that introduced the first Ethernet switch.

The primary advantage of cut-through Ethernet switches, compared to store-and-forward Ethernet switches, is lower latency.
Cut-through Ethernet switches can support an end-to-end network delay latency of about ten microseconds.
End-to-end application latencies below 3 microseconds require specialized hardware such as InfiniBand.

A cut-through switch will forward corrupted frames, whereas a store and forward switch will drop them. Fragment free is a variation on cut-through switching that partially addresses this problem by assuring that collision fragments are not forwarded. Fragment free will hold the frame until the first 64 bytes are read from the source to detect a collision before forwarding. This is only useful if there is a chance of a collision on the source port.

The theory here is that frames that are damaged by collisions are often shorter than the minimum valid Ethernet frame size of 64 bytes. With a fragment-free buffer, the first 64 bytes of each frame update the source MAC and port if necessary, provide the destination MAC, and allow forwarding the frame. If the frame is less than 64 bytes, it is discarded. Frames that are smaller than 64 bytes are called runts; this is why fragment-free switching is sometimes called “runt-less” switching. Because the switch only ever buffers 64 bytes of each frame, fragment-free is a faster mode than store-and-forward, but there still exists a risk of forwarding bad frames.

There are certain scenarios that force a cut-through Ethernet switch to buffer the entire frame, acting like a store-and-forward Ethernet switch for that frame:
* Speed: When the outgoing port is faster than the incoming port, the switch must buffer the entire frame received from the lower-speed port before the switch can start transmitting that frame out the high-speed port, to prevent underrun. (When the outgoing port is slower than the incoming port, the switch can perform cut-through switching and start transmitting that frame before it is entirely received, although it must still buffer most of the frame).
* Congestion: When a cut-through switch decides a frame from one incoming port needs to go out through an outgoing port, but that outgoing port is already busy sending a frame from a second incoming port, the switch must buffer some or all of the frame from the first incoming port.

==Use in Fibre Channel==

Cut-through switching is the dominant switching architecture in Fibre Channel due to the low-latency performance required for SCSI traffic. Brocade has implemented cut-through switching in its Fibre Channel ASICs since the 1990s and has been implemented in tens of millions of ports in production SANs worldwide. CRC errors are detected in a cut-through switch and indicated by marking the corrupted frame EOF field as &quot;invalid&quot;. The destination devices (host or storage) sees the invalid EOF and discards the frame prior to sending it to the application or LUN. Discarding corrupted frames by the destination device is a 100% reliable method for error handling and is mandated by Fibre Channel standards driven by Technical Committee T11. Discarding corrupted frames at the destination device also minimizes the time to recover bad frames. As soon as the destination device receives the EOF marker as &quot;invalid&quot;, recovery of the corrupted frame can begin. With store and forward, the corrupted frame is discarded at the switch forcing a SCSI timeout and a SCSI retry for recovery that can result in delays of tens of seconds.

==Use in ATM==

Cut-through switching was one of the important features of IP networks using ATM networks since the edge routers of the ATM network were able to use cell switching through the core of the network with low latency at all points. With higher speed links, this has become less of a problem since packet latency has become much smaller.

==Use in InfiniBand==

Cut-through switching is very popular in InfiniBand networks, since these are often deployed in environments where latency is a prime concern, such as supercomputer clusters.

==Use in SMTP==

A closely allied concept is
offered
by the Exim mail transfer agent. When operating as a forwarder the onward connection can be made to the destination while the source connection is still open.
This permits data-time rejection (due, for example, to content-scanning) by the target MTA to be notified to the source MTA within the SMTP connection, rather than the traditional bounce message necessitated by the more usual store-and-forward operation.

==Use in Bitcoin==
Cut-through switching has been applied to make block-relay lower latency in Bitcoin. Low latency is critical for Bitcoin miners to reduce the rate at which their blocks are orphaned.

<doc id="541497" wikidata="Q72652" url="?curid=541497" title="Albert R. Broccoli">
<text>Albert Romolo Broccoli ( ; April 5, 1909 – June 27, 1996), nicknamed &quot;Cubby&quot;, was an American film producer who made more than 40 motion pictures throughout his career. Most of the films were made in the United Kingdom and often filmed at Pinewood Studios. Co-founder of Danjaq, LLC and Eon Productions, Broccoli is most notable as the producer of many of the &quot;James Bond&quot; films. He and Harry Saltzman saw the films develop from relatively low-budget origins to large-budget, high-grossing extravaganzas of which Broccoli&#x27;s heirs continued to produce new Bond films until 2021.

==Early life and career==
Broccoli was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, the younger of two children of immigrants from the Calabria region of Italy, Giovanni Broccoli and Kristina Vence. He had an older brother. He acquired his nickname after his cousin, mobster Pat DiCicco, began calling him &quot;Kabibble&quot;, after a similarly named cartoon character. This was eventually shortened to &quot;Kubbie&quot; and adopted by Broccoli as &quot;Cubby&quot;. The family later bought a farm in Smithtown, New York, on Long Island, near their relatives the DiCiccos.

The family moved to Florida, and on the death of his father Giovanni, Broccoli moved to live with his grandmother in Astoria, Queens, in New York City. Having worked many jobs, including casket maker, Broccoli then became involved in the film industry. He started at the bottom, working as a gofer on Howard Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1941), which starred Jane Russell. Here he met his lifelong friend Howard Hughes for the first time, while Hughes was overseeing the movie&#x27;s production after director Howard Hawks was fired. Broccoli rose quickly to the level of assistant director by the time the U.S. entered World War II.

He served in the US Navy during World War II from 1942 to 1947 where he met Ray Stark.

In 1951, he and Irving Allen created Warwick Films in order to take advantage of tax incentives available to them by producing films in the United Kingdom with British crews, while often using American stars. Among the films they produced are &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (1953), &quot;Hell Below Zero&quot; (1954), &quot;The Black Knight&quot; (1954), &quot;The Gamma People&quot; (1956), &quot;Safari&quot; (1956), &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960), among others. The Allen–Broccoli partnership ended in part due to a disagreement over acquiring film rights to the &quot;James Bond&quot; novels as Allen felt they were of poor quality. Broccoli partnered instead with Harry Saltzman in 1961 to form Eon Productions, which would produce the &quot;Bond&quot; series. (See Production of the James Bond films)

=== Ted Healy incident ===
Broccoli is alleged to have been involved in an altercation with comedian and Three Stooges creator Ted Healy outside the Trocadero nightclub, just before the latter&#x27;s death in 1937. A source alleged that actor Wallace Beery, Broccoli, and film producer Pat DiCicco beat Healy so badly that he fell into a coma and died. There is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present, allegedly because the investigation and any subsequent newspaper coverage would be routinely sidelined by the MGM studio fixers, Eddie Mannix and Howard Strickling (Mannix would later become a producer and executive for MGM), since Wallace Beery was one of MGM&#x27;s most highly-paid and important actors. Beery was immediately dispatched to a long vacation in Europe until the story died down. Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fist fight with Healy at the Trocadero. He later modified his story, stating that a heavily intoxicated Healy had picked a fight with him, the two had briefly scuffled, then shook hands and parted ways. In other reports, Broccoli admitted to pushing Healy, but not striking him.

There is disagreement over whether Healy died as a result of the brawl or due to his well-known alcoholism. Because of the authorities&#x27; lack of interest in investigating Healy&#x27;s death, an autopsy was not performed until after Healy&#x27;s body had been embalmed, rendering the examiner&#x27;s note that Healy&#x27;s organs were &quot;soaked in alcohol&quot; useless in determining a cause of death.

Following the autopsy, the Los Angeles county coroner reported that Healy died of acute toxic nephritis secondary to acute and chronic alcoholism. Police closed their investigation, as there was no indication in the report that his death was caused by physical assault.

==Personal life==
Broccoli married three times. In 1940, at the age of 31, he married actress Gloria Blondell, the younger sister of Joan Blondell. They later divorced amicably in 1945 without having had children. In 1951, he married Nedra Clark, widow of the singer Buddy Clark. They adopted a son, Tony Broccoli, after which Nedra became pregnant. She died in 1958, soon after giving birth to their daughter, Tina. In 1959, Broccoli married actress and novelist Dana Natol. They had a daughter, Barbara Broccoli, and Natol adopted his other two children. Albert Broccoli became a mentor to Dana&#x27;s teenage son, Michael G. Wilson. The children grew up around the Bond film sets, and his wife&#x27;s influence on various production decisions is alluded to in many informal accounts.

In 1966, Broccoli was in Japan with other producers scouting locations to film the next James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. He had a ticket booked on BOAC Flight 911 and cancelled his ticket on that day so he could see a ninja demonstration. Flight 911 crashed due to clear-air turbulence, killing everyone on board.

Michael Wilson worked his way up through the production company to co-write and co-produce. Barbara Broccoli, in her turn, served in several capacities under her father&#x27;s tutelage from the 1980s on. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have co-produced the films since Albert Broccoli&#x27;s death.

==Later life and honors==

* In 1981 he was honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work in film. The award was presented at the 1982 Academy Awards ceremony by the then-current James Bond, Roger Moore. In 1990, Broccoli also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (as Cubby Broccoli).
* A thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast, Albert Broccoli owned Brocco, who won the 1993 Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita Park at Arcadia, California.
* An autobiography was published posthumously in 1999, titled &quot;When the Snow Melts: The Autobiography of Cubby Broccoli&quot; ().
* The end of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997) displays the dedication &quot;In loving memory of Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli&quot;.
* The Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre is one of three situated in the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts Complex, completed in 2010.

==Death==
Broccoli died at his home in Beverly Hills in 1996 at the age of 87 of heart failure. He had undergone a triple heart bypass earlier that year. He was interred in an ornate sarcophagus in the outdoor Courts of Remembrance section, at Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles following a funeral mass at The Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills. Former Bond actor Timothy Dalton was among the pallbearers.

<text>Indoor tanning involves using a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to produce a cosmetic tan. Typically found in tanning salons, gyms, spas, hotels, and sporting facilities, and less often in private residences, the most common device is a horizontal tanning bed, also known as a sunbed or solarium. Vertical devices are known as tanning booths or stand-up sunbeds.

First introduced in the 1960s, indoor tanning became popular with people in the Western world, particularly in Scandinavia, in the late 1970s. The practice finds a cultural parallel in skin whitening in Asian countries, and both support multibillion-dollar industries. Most indoor tanners are women, 16–25 years old, who want to improve their appearance or mood, acquire a pre-holiday tan, or treat a skin condition.
==Background==
===Ultraviolet radiation===
Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, just beyond visible light. Ultraviolet wavelengths are 100 to 400 nanometres (nm, billionths of a metre) and are divided into three bands: A, B and C. UVA wavelengths are the longest, 315 to 400 nm; UVB are 280 to 315 nm, and UVC wavelengths are the shortest, 100 to 280 nm.

About 95% of the UVR that reaches the earth from the sun is UVA and 5% UVB; no appreciable UVC reaches the earth. While tanning systems before the 1970s produced some UVC, modern tanning devices produce no UVC, a small amount of UVB and mostly UVA. Classified by the WHO as a group 1 carcinogen, UV radiation has &quot;complex and mixed effects on human health&quot;. While it causes skin cancer and other damage, including skin aging or creases such as wrinkles, it also triggers the synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin.

===History===
In 1890 the Danish physician Niels Ryberg Finsen developed a carbon arc lamp (&quot;Finsen&#x27;s light&quot; or a &quot;Finsen lamp&quot;) that produced ultraviolet radiation for use in skin therapy, including to treat lupus vulgaris. He won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work.

Until the 20th century in Europe and the United States, pale skin was a symbol of high social class among white people. Victorian women would carry parasols and wear wide-brimmed hats and gloves; their homes featured heavy curtains that kept out the sun. But as the working classes moved from country work to city factories, and to crowded, dark, unsanitary homes, pale skin became increasingly associated with poverty and ill health. In 1923 Coco Chanel returned from a holiday in Cannes with a tan, later telling &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine: &quot;A golden tan is the index of chic!&quot; Tanned skin had become a fashion accessory.

In parallel physicians began advising their patients on the benefits of the &quot;sun cure&quot;, citing its antiseptic properties. Sunshine was promoted as a treatment for depression, diabetes, constipation, pneumonia, high and low blood pressure, and many other ailments. Home-tanning equipment was introduced in the 1920s in the form of &quot;sunlamps&quot; or &quot;health lamps&quot;, UV lamps that emitted a large percentage of UVB, leading to burns. Friedrich Wolff, a German scientist, began using UV light on athletes, and developed beds that emitted 95% UVA and 5% UVB, which reduced the likelihood of burning. The world&#x27;s first tanning salon opened in 1977 in Berlin, followed by tanning salons in Europe and North America in the late 1970s. In 1978 Wolff&#x27;s devices began selling in the United States, and the indoor tanning industry was born.

==Devices==

===Lamps===

Tanning lamps, also known as tanning bulbs or tanning tubes, produce the ultraviolet light in tanning devices. The performance (or output) varies widely between brands and styles. Most are low-pressure fluorescent tubes, but high-pressure bulbs also exist. The electronics systems and number of lamps affect performance, but to a lesser degree than the lamp itself. Tanning lamps are regulated separately from tanning beds in most countries, as they are the consumable portion of the system.

===Beds===

Most tanning beds are horizontal enclosures with a bench and canopy (lid) that house long, low-pressure fluorescent bulbs (100–200 watt) under an acrylic surface. The tanner is surrounded by bulbs when the canopy is closed. Modern tanning beds emit mostly UVA (the sun emits around 95% UVA and 5% UVB). One review of studies found that the UVB irradiance of beds was on average lower than the summer sun at latitudes 37°S to 35°N, but that UVA irradiance was on average much higher.

The user sets a timer (or it is set remotely by the salon operator), lies on the bed and pulls down the canopy. The maximum exposure time for most low-pressure beds is 15–20 minutes. In the US, maximum times are set by the manufacturer according to how long it takes to produce four &quot;minimal erythema doses&quot; (MEDs), an upper limit laid down by the FDA. An MED is the amount of UV radiation that will produce erythema (redness of the skin) within a few hours of exposure.

High-pressure beds use smaller, higher-wattage quartz bulbs and emit a higher percentage of UVA. They may emit 10–15 times more UVA than the midday sun, and have a shorter maximum exposure time (typically 10–12 minutes). UVA gives an immediate, short-term tan by bronzing melanin in the skin, but no new melanin is formed. UVB has no immediate bronzing effect, but with a delay of 72 hours makes the skin produce new melanin, leading to tans of longer duration. UVA is less likely to cause burning or dry skin than UVB but is associated with wrinkling and loss of elasticity because it penetrates deeper.

Commercial tanning beds cost $6,000 to $30,000 as of 2006, with high-pressure beds at the high end. 

===Booths===
Tanning booths (also known as stand-up sunbeds) are vertical enclosures; the tanner stands during exposure, hanging onto straps or handrails, and is surrounded by tanning bulbs. In most models, the tanner closes a door, but there are open designs too. Some booths use the same electronics and lamps as tanning beds, but most have more lamps and are likely to use 100–160 watt lamps. They often have a maximum session of 7–15 minutes. There are other technical differences, or degrees of intensity, but for all practical intents, their function and safety are the same as a horizontal bed. Booths have a smaller footprint, which some commercial operators find useful. Some tanners prefer booths out of concern for hygiene, since the only shared surface is the floor.

==Eye protection==

Eye protection for indoor tanning, either in the form of goggles, or disposable eye protection must be worn to avoid eye damage. In one 2004 study, tanners said they avoided using indoor tanning eye protection at times to prevent leaving the appearance of pale skin around the eyes.
==Prevalence==
===Tanning-device use===
Indoor tanning is most popular with white females, 16–25 years old, with low-to-moderate skin sensitivity, who know other tanners. Studies seeking to link indoor tanning to education level and income have returned inconsistent results. Prevalence was highest in one German study among those with a moderate level of education (neither high nor low).

The late teens to early–mid 20s is the highest-prevalence age group. In a national survey of white teenagers in 2003 in the US (aged 13–19), 24% had used a tanning facility. Indoor-tanning prevalence figures in the US vary from 30 million each year to just under 10 million (7.8 million women and 1.9 million men).

The figures in the US are in decline: according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, usage in the 18–29 age group fell from 11.3 percent in 2010 to 8.6 percent in 2013, perhaps attributable in part to a 10% &quot;tanning tax&quot; introduced in 2010. Attitudes toward tanning vary across states; in one study, doctors in the northeast and midwest of the country were more likely than those in the south or west to recommend tanning beds to treat vitamin D deficiency and depression.

Tanning bed use is more prevalent in northern countries. In Sweden in 2001, 44% said they had used one (in a survey of 1,752 men and women aged 18–37). Their use increased in Denmark between 1994 and 2002 from 35% to 50% (reported use in the previous two years). In Germany, between 29% and 47% had used one, and one survey found that 21% had done so in the previous year. In France, 15% of adults in 1994–1995 had tanned indoors; the practice was more common in the north of France. In 2006, 12% of grade 9–10 students in Canada had used a tanning bed in the last year. In 2004, 7% of 8–11-year-olds in Scotland said they had used one. Tanning bed use is higher in the UK in the north of England. One study found that the prevalence was lower in London than in less urban areas of the country.

===Density of facilities===
Tanning facilities are ubiquitous in the US, although the figures are in decline. In a study in the US published in 2002, there was a higher density in colder areas with a lower median income and higher proportion of whites. A study in 1997 found an average of 50.3 indoor-tanning facilities in 20 US cities (13.89 facilities for every 100,000 residents); the highest was 134 in Minneapolis, MN, and the lowest four in Honolulu, Hawaii. In 2006 a study of 116 cities in the US found 41.8 facilities on average, a higher density than either Starbucks or McDonald&#x27;s. Of the country&#x27;s 125 top colleges and universities in 2014, 12% had indoor-tanning facilities on campus and 42.4% in off-campus housing, 96% of the latter free of charge to the tenants.

There are fewer professional salons than tanning facilities; the latter includes tanning beds in gyms, spas and similar. According to the FDA, citing the Indoor Tanning Association, there were 25,000 tanning salons in 2010 in the US (population 308.7 million in 2010). Mailing-list data suggest there were 18,200 in September 2008 and 12,200 in September 2015, a decline of 30 percent. According to Chris Sternberg of the American Suntanning Association, the figures are 18,000 in 2009 and 9,500 in 2016.

The South West Public Health Observatory found 5,350 tanning salons in the UK in 2009: 4,492 in England (population 52.6 million in 2010), 484 in Scotland (5.3 million), 203 in Wales (3 million) and 171 in Northern Ireland (1.8 million).

==Reasons==
===Overview===
Reasons cited for indoor tanning include improving appearance, acquiring a pre-holiday tan, feeling good and treating a skin condition. Tanners often cite feelings of well-being; exposure to tanning beds is reported to &quot;increase serum beta-endorphin levels by 44%&quot;. Beta-endorphin is associated with feelings of relaxation and euphoria, including &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot;.

Improving appearance is the most-cited reason. Studies show that tanned skin has semiotic power, signifying health, beauty, youth and the ability to seduce. Women, in particular, say not only that they prefer their appearance with tanned skin, but that they receive the same message from friends and family, especially from other women. They believe tanned skin makes them look thinner and more toned, and that it covers or heals skin blemishes such as acne. Other reasons include acquiring a base tan for further sunbathing; that a uniform tan is easier to achieve in a tanning unit than in the sun, and a desire to avoid tan lines. Proponents of indoor tanning say that tanning beds deliver more consistent, predictable exposure than the sun, but studies show that indoor tanners do suffer burns. In two surveys in the US in 1998 and 2004, 58% of indoor tanners said they had been burned during sessions.
===Vitamin D===

Vitamin D is produced when the skin is exposed to UVB, whether from sunlight or an artificial source. It is needed for mineralization of bone and bone growth. Exposing arms and legs to a minimal 0.5 erythemal (mild sunburn) UVB dose is equal to consuming about 3000 IU of vitamin D3. Researchers reported that adults who used tanning beds had &quot;robust&quot; levels of 25(OH)D (46 ng/mL on average), along with higher hip bone density, compared to adults who did not use them.

Obtaining vitamin D from indoor tanning has to be weighed against the risk of developing skin cancer. The indoor-tanning industry has stressed the relationship between tanning and the production of vitamin D. According to the US National Institutes of Health, some researchers have suggested that &quot;5–30 minutes of sun exposure between 10 AM and 3 PM at least twice a week to the face, arms, legs, or back without sunscreen usually lead to sufficient vitamin D synthesis and that the moderate use of commercial tanning beds that emit 2%–6% UVB radiation is also effective&quot;. Most researchers say the health risks outweigh the benefits, that the UVB doses produced by tanning beds exceed what is needed for adequate vitamin D production, and that adequate vitamin D levels can be achieved by taking supplements and eating fortified foods.
===Medical use===

Certain skin conditions, including keratosis, psoriasis, eczema and acne, may be treated with UVB light therapy, including by using tanning beds in commercial salons. Using tanning beds allows patients to access UV exposure when dermatologist-provided phototherapy is not available. A systematic review of studies, published in &quot;Dermatology and Therapy&quot; in 2015, noted that moderate sunlight is a treatment recommended by the American National Psoriasis Foundation, and suggested that clinicians consider UV phototherapy and tanning beds as a source of that therapy. Physicians have recommended tanning devices to treat skin conditions. 

When UV light therapy is used in combination with psoralen, an oral or topical medication, the combined therapy is referred to as PUVA. A concern with the use of commercial tanning is that beds that primarily emit UVA may not treat psoriasis effectively. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to erythemogenic doses of either UVA or UVB. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.

==Risks==
===Skin cancer===

Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), whether from outdoor tanning under the sun or indoor tanning using tanning devices is known to be a major cause of the three main types of skin cancer: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and melanoma. Overexposure to UVR induces at least two types of DNA damage: cyclobutane–pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts (6–4PPs). While DNA repair enzymes can fix some mutations, if they are not sufficiently effective, a cell will acquire genetic mutations which may cause the cell to die or become cancerous. These mutations can result in cancer, aging, persistent mutation and cell death. For example, squamous cell carcinoma can be caused by a UVB-induced mutation in the p53 gene.

Non-melanoma skin cancer includes squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and is more common than melanoma. With early detection and treatment, it is typically not life-threatening. Prevalence increases with age, cumulative exposure to UV, and proximity to the equator. It is most prevalent in Australia, where the rate is 1,000 in 100,000 and where, as of 2000, it represented 75 percent of all cancers.

Melanoma accounts for approximately one percent of skin cancer, and causes most of skin cancer-related deaths. The average age of diagnosis is 63, and it is the most common cancer in the 25–29 age group and the second most common in the 15-29 group, which may be due in part to the increased UV exposure and use of indoor tanning observed in this population. In the United States, the melanoma incidence rate was 22.3 per 100,000, based on 2010–2014 data from the National Institutes of Health Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, and the death rate was 2.7 per 100,000. 9,730 people were estimated to die of melanoma in the United States in 2017, and these numbers are anticipated to continue rising. Although 91.7% of patients diagnosed with melanoma survive beyond 5-years, advanced melanoma is largely incurable, and only 19.9% percent of patients with metastatic disease survive beyond 5 years. An international meta-analysis performed in 2014 estimates that annually, 464,170 cases of skin cancer can be attributed to exposure to indoor tanning.

=== Age and indoor tanning ===
The age at which someone begins indoor tanning has a known impact on the later risk of developing cancers. A 2012 analysis of epidemiological studies found a 20% increase in the risk of melanoma (a relative risk of 1.20) among those who had ever used a tanning device compared to those who had not, and a 59% percent increase (a relative risk of 1.59) among those who had used one before age 35. Additionally, a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that indoor tanners had a 16 percent increased risk of developing melanoma, which increased to 23 percent for North Americans. For those who started tanning indoors before age 25, their risk further increased to 35% compared to those who began after age 25.

===Young people===

Children and adolescents who use tanning beds are at greater risk because of biological vulnerability to UV radiation. Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to artificial tanning increases the risk of malignant melanoma and that the longer the exposure, the greater the risk, particularly in individuals exposed before the age of 30 or who have been sunburned.

One study conducted among college students found that awareness of the risks of tanning beds did not deter the students from using them. Teenagers are frequent targets of tanning industry marketing, which includes offers of coupons and placing ads in high-school newspapers. Members of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce commissioned a &quot;sting&quot; operation in 2012, in which callers posing as a 16-year-old woman who wanted to tan for the first time called 300 tanning salons in the US. Staff reportedly failed to follow FDA recommendations, denied the risks of tanning, and offered misleading information about benefits.

===Dependency concern===
Developing a dependence on indoor tanning has been recognized as a psychiatric disorder. The disorder is characterized as excessive indoor tanning that causes the subject personal distress; it has been associated with anxiety, eating disorders and smoking. The media has described the disorder as &quot;tanorexia&quot;. According to the Canadian Pediatric Society, &quot;repeated UVR exposures, and the use of indoor tanning beds specifically, may have important systemic and behavioral consequences, including mood changes, compulsive disorders, pain and physical dependency.&quot; Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health found evidence of dependence on tanning in a 2017 paper.

===Other risks===
Exposure to UV radiation is associated with skin aging, wrinkle production, liver spots, loss of skin elasticity, erythema (reddening of the skin), sunburn, photokeratitis (snow blindness), ocular melanoma (eye cancer), and infections. Tanning beds can contain many microbes, some of which are pathogens that can cause skin infections and gastric distress. In one study in New York in 2009, the most common pathogens found on tanning beds were &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; spp. (&quot;aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;putida&quot;), &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp., &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus&quot; species, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Enterobacter cloacae&quot;. Several prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including antidepressants, antibiotics, antifungals and anti-diabetic medication, can cause photosensitivity, which makes burning the skin while tanning more likely. This risk is increased by a lack of staff training in tanning facilities.

==Regulation==
From 1997 several countries and US states had banned under-18-year-old persons from indoor tanning.

=== Australia ===
Commercial tanning services are banned in all states, except the Northern Territory where no salons are in operation. Private ownership of tanning beds is permitted. The commercial use of tanning beds was banned entirely in Australia in 2015.

===Brazil===
Brazil&#x27;s National Health Surveillance Agency banned the use of tanning beds for cosmetic purposes in 2009, making that country the first to enact a ban. It followed a 2002 ban on minors using the beds.

===Canada===
Indoor tanning is prohibited for under-18s in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island; and for under-19s in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Northwest Territories. Health Canada recommends against the use of tanning equipment.

===European Union===
In 1997 France became the first country to ban minors from indoor tanning. Under-18s are similarly prohibited in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom. In addition, Ireland prohibits salons from offering &quot;happy hour&quot; discounts. Netherlands also forbid the usage of a tanning bed below the age of 18.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, indoor tanning is regulated by a voluntary code of practice. Salons are asked to turn away under-18s, those with type 1 skin (fair skin that burns easily or never tans), people who experienced episodes of sunburn as children, and anyone taking certain medications, with several moles, or who has had skin cancer. Tanners are asked to sign a consent form, which includes health information and advice about the importance of wearing goggles. Surveys have found a high level of non-compliance. The government has carried out bi-annual surveys of tanning facilities since 2012.

===United States===

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies tanning beds as &quot;moderate risk&quot; devices (changed in 2014 from &quot;low risk&quot;). It requires that devices carry a black box warning that they should not be used by individuals under the age of 18. There is no federal ban on indoor use by minors. , California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Washington have banned the use of tanning beds for minors under the age of 18. Other states strictly regulate indoor tanning under the age of 18, with most banning indoor tanning for persons under the age of 14 unless medically required, and some requiring the consent of a guardian for those aged 14–17. Injuries caused by tanning devices lead to over 3,000 emergency-room cases a year in the United States. 

In 2010 under the Affordable Care Act, a 10% excise tax was introduced on indoor tanning dubbed a &quot;tanning tax&quot;, which is added to the fees charged by tanning facilities; it was expected to raise $2.7 billion for health care over ten years.

Tanning beds are regulated in the United States by the federal government&#x27;s Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 1040.20). This is designed to ensure that the devices adhere to a set of safety rules, with the primary focus on sunbed and lamp manufacturers regarding maximum exposure times and product equivalence. Additionally, must have a &quot;Recommended Exposure Schedule&quot; posted on both the front of the tanning bed and in the owners&#x27; manual, and list the original lamp that was certified for that particular tanning bed. Salon owners are required to replace the lamps with either exactly the same lamp, or a lamp that is certified by the lamp manufacturer to be.

States control regulations for salons, regarding operator training, sanitization of sunbeds and eyewear, and additional warning signs. Many states also ban or regulate the use of tanning beds by minors under the age of 18.

American osteopathic physician Joseph Mercola was prosecuted in 2016 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for selling tanning beds to &quot;reverse your wrinkles&quot; and &quot;slash your risk of cancer&quot;. The settlement meant that consumers who had purchased the devices were eligible for refunds totaling $5.3 million. Mercola had falsely claimed that the FDA &quot;endorsed indoor tanning devices as safe&quot;, and had failed to disclose that he had paid the Vitamin D Council for its endorsement of his devices. The FTC said that it was deceptive for the defendants to fail to disclose that tanning is not necessary to produce vitamin D.

<text>Progress in the area of prevention is formulated in an environment of beliefs, called paradigms as can be seen in the next table. Some of them can be referred to as professional folklore, &quot;i.e.&quot; a widely supported set of beliefs with no real basis. For example, the “accident-prone driver” was a belief that was supported by the data in the sense that a small number of drivers do participate in a disproportionate number of accidents, it follows that the identification and removal of this drivers will reduce crashes. A more scientific analysis of the data indicate that this phenomenon can be explained simply by the random nature of the accidents, and not for a specific error-prone attitude of such drivers.

From: OECD Road Transport Research

== National programs==

A prerequisite for progress in this area is to introduce national programs with clear and quantifiable objectives, some examples are:
*Chile 0% growth in fatalities, (down from historical 5-7% annual growth), (CONASET, 1993)
*EU, 40% reduction in fatalities for 2010
*Denmark 40% reduction for 2000
*Finland 65% reduction for 2005
*United Kingdom 33% reduction for 2000
*United States No more than 1.0 fatality for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 2008

Sweden has developed a new concept to improve road safety called &quot;Vision Zero&quot;.
Vision Zero is conceived from the ethical base that it can never be acceptable that people are killed or seriously injured when moving within the road transport system. It centres around an explicit goal, and develops into a highly pragmatic and scientifically based strategy which challenges the traditional approach to road safety.

Vision Zero: strategic principles
*The traffic system has to adapt to take better account of the needs, mistakes and vulnerabilities of road users.
*The level of violence that the human body can tolerate without being killed or seriously injured forms the basic parameter in the design of the road transport system.
*Vehicle speed is the most important regulating factor for a safe road traffic. It should be determined by the technical standard of both roads and vehicle so as not to exceed the level of violence that the human body can tolerate.

While the concept envisages responsibility for safety amongst the designers and users of the system, the designer has the final responsibility for &quot;fail-safe&quot; measures.

Vision Zero: system designer has primary responsibility
*System designers are responsible for the design, operation and the use of the road transport system and are thereby responsible for the level of safety within the entire system.
*Road users are responsible for following the rules for using the road transport system set by the system designers.
*If the users fail to comply with these rules due to a lack of knowledge, acceptance or ability, the system designers are required to take the necessary further steps to counteract people being killed or injured.

==Management systems==

Modern Road Safety makes a distinction between the situation and the management systems necessary to control it, with prevention activities that largely exceeds the self-evident fields of the traditional &quot;3 E&quot; (Engineering, Enforcement, Education) approach, first introduced in 1925. Modern Management systems have the aims of be inclusive, &quot;i.e.&quot; to include explicitly all activities part of such system. Forming an integrated whole

The more extensive effort to obtain a comprehensive, holistic design of a road safety system, with the direct participation of 123 persons, representatives of different areas of activities, was done in Chile, (CONASET, 1993), utilizing the methodology for the design of social systems developed by Del Valle (1992). The result was the design of the control apparatus for this situation, called “Road Safety System”, defined by its components. An informal test of its completeness can be done simply by consider this management system without any of its components, for example if we remove rescue we simply lose opportunities to save human life coming from activities in this area. It can be used as an outline to assess the completeness of national road safety programs.

Please note than the following table is a systems definition i.e. it is supposed that is parts form an integrated whole.

==Semantics==
The field of Road safety is handicapped by the terminology. Words have power to them that conveys impressions as well as meanings, phenomena that in this case results in sub-optimal approaches to prevention, as follows:

===Road safety===
The name “Road safety” have conveyed that in this field the activities need to concentrate on items that properly belong to roads and, by extension, to the roads authorities, keeping a reduced scope of activities in a number of different areas, in spite of their potentially significant contributions. For example, in the UK, Burrough, (1991) indicates that only one-third of the target reduction will be delivered by road safety engineering measures while Koornstra ( 2002) indicates “The contribution of local road engineering to the fatality reductions between 1980 and 2000 are estimated to be 4% for Sweden, 10% for Britain, and 5% for the Netherlands”. Whereas TEC (2003), quotes a research from the Imperial College, London that indicates than the progress in medical technology and care made a significant contribution to the 45% fall of fatalities during the last 20 years, and account for 700 lives saved annually in the UK, and further puts forward that the lack of consideration of the benefits coming from the medical area, suggests that road safety is probably less effective that thought. It is remarkable that implicitly the author of the research doesn&#x27;t consider medical activities as a component of a road safety management system.

It reflects confusion between the space where this phenomenon occurs (mainly roads) and the design of the Management systems to control it, in what “Roads” is only a 11% of the activities (one area out of nine in previous table).

===Accident===
The use of the word “accident” with its connotations of being and unavoidable event, weaken the resolve to intervene in order to reduce crashes and the resulting harm. Evans (1991) argues that the word “crash” indicates in a simple factual way what is observed, while “Accident” seems to suggest in addition a general explanation of why it occurred.

===Cause of accidents===
Road safety recognizes that crashes, and their consequences, are multifactor events, Ogden (1996) indicates: “An approach based in notions of cause and blame is simplistic in the extreme”. In short, crashes have factors not causes .

===Problem-solving===
Old approaches emphasize the concept of problem-solving in road safety, but it is more correct to recognize that road safety activities do not solve problems. For instance, when a safer road design is implemented, hopefully the number of crashes, or their seriousness, will go down, but they will not disappear. It is more correct to say the implementation of correct policies, programs and measures will reduce numbers or consequences of crashes, but they will not be ´´solved´´.

This realization is important, because it changes the focus from a problem that will go away if we devote enough resources to it, to a situation requiring on-going management. This management in turn requires the development of scientifically based techniques, which will enable us to predict with confidence that safety resources are well-spent and likely to be effective.

<text>HEC Paris () is a business school and &quot;grande école&quot; located in Jouy-en-Josas, a southwestern outer suburb of Paris, France. It offers Bachelor, MiM, MSc in International Finance, MBA, EMBA, executive education, professional development, professional certification, and PhD programs. 

==History==

Founded in 1881 by Gustave Emmanuel Roy, president of the Paris Chamber of Commerce (CCIP), with 57 students in its first class, the &quot;École des hautes études commerciales de Paris&quot; (HEC) aimed to be in the fields of management and commerce what the &quot;École Centrale de Paris&quot; was in the field of engineering.

In 1921, the school introduced the case-based method of the Harvard Business School, but most of the lectures remained theoretical. In 1938, the HEC program was lengthened to 3 years.

Due to French corporations&#x27; demand for North-American-style management education, at the end of the 1950s, the case-based method was generalized and a one-year &quot;classe préparatoire&quot; was created to prepare for the entrance examination, which had become more difficult. As a result, only 9% of HEC students had attended university in 1959, whereas 47% had done so in 1929.

In 1964, French President Charles de Gaulle inaugurated a new wooded campus in Jouy-en-Josas. In 1967, HEC launched its executive education programs. Women have been accepted at HEC since 1973. Only 27 women were accepted that year and &quot;HEC jeunes filles&quot; (HECJF), another school dedicated to women, was closed. Its alumnae are officially considered graduates of HEC, and include Édith Cresson, the first female Prime Minister of France.

The doctoral course was established in 1975 but until 1985 doctoral students had to complete their thesis at the university. In 1985 the HEC obtained the right to award the title of doctor, before ESSEC (2010) and ESCP (2012).

The school has developed professorships financed by companies (Deloitte, EDF, Toshiba and others) to multiply links between HEC and companies. The HEC Foundation, founded in 1972, has the specific aim of developing these connections and the financing of the school by companies.

Ties with businesses were strengthened in the 1990s and this led to greater specialization, with the establishment of finance and entrepreneurship courses in 1986. As a consequence of the &quot;financial Big Bang&quot; and the explosion of the City, more and more graduates went to work in England and, in general, abroad. In 2006, a third found their first job abroad. In 2015 the school adopted a new legal statute to allow private investors to join the board of directors.

In 1988, HEC founded the CEMS network with ESADE, Bocconi University and the University of Cologne.

On 1 July 2008, HEC Paris joined ParisTech and then Paris-Saclay University as a founding member. The university campus of Jouy-en-Josas, in the Yvelines department, is located in the northern part of the technological cluster of Paris-Saclay, which brings together a quarter of French public research. HEC Paris is part of the network of graduate schools of business (ESC) in the Paris Île-de-France area, together with ESSEC and ESCP Business School.

In 2016, the school adopted a new legal status and became a public-private partnership (&quot;École consulaire&quot; or EESC), largely financed by the public Chamber of Commerce in Paris.

In 2017, HEC launched a portfolio of new dual degree programs called M2M with the Yale School of Management, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Fundação Getulio Vargas.

The same year in March, the school launched the Executive Master in innovation &amp; entrepreneurship program in collaboration with Coursera.

On 15 September 2020, the school co-founded with the Polytechnic Institute of Paris the artificial intelligence research center Hi! PARIS.

In October 2023 the school announced the creation of a Bachelor of Arts in data, society and organisations in collaboration with Bocconi University in Milan.

== Grande École system and Accreditation ==

Degrees (such as the Master in Management or &quot;&quot;Grande École&quot; program&quot;) from HEC Paris are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and by the Ministry of National Education. 

HEC Paris is also triple accredited by the European Foundation for Management Development (EQUIS), the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and the Association of MBAs (AMBA).

HEC Paris is also one of the founding members of CEMS - Global Alliance in Management Education.

== International rankings ==

==Programs==

Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the &quot;Licence (&quot;Bachelor&#x27;s), Master&#x27;s, and Doctorate degrees. A Bachelor&#x27;s degree requires the completion of 180 ECTS credits (bac + 3); a Master&#x27;s, requires an additional 120 ECTS credits (bac + 5). HEC Paris offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree since October 2023. 

=== Master in Management - &quot;Grande École&quot; program ===
Its highly coveted PGE &quot;(Programme Grande École&quot; or &quot;Grande École&quot; program) ends with the awarding of Master&#x27;s in Management (MiM) degree. Outside of the PGE, students at HEC can be awarded other master&#x27;s degrees, such as the MBA (bac + 5), or a PhD (bac + 8).

=== Bachelor in Data, Society and Organisations ===
Announced in October 2023, the school offers a Bachelor of Arts in partnership with Bocconi University in Milan. Focused on Data, Society &amp; Organizations, it combines data sciences and social sciences. Students spend the first three semesters in Italy and the last three in France on the Jouy-en-Josas campus.

=== MSc in International Finance (MIF) ===
The MSc in International Finance is ranked #1 worldwide for pre-experience programs (2020 FT Rankings).

=== Master of Business Administration (MBA) ===
The MBA program, created in 1969, has two intakes: September and January. HEC&#x27;s MBA consists of a 16-month-long curriculum, with 8 months of core courses and 8 months of a customized program, including several specialization options, exchange programs, and fieldwork projects. A typical class is composed of some 250 students – 90% of whom are international students – with more than 52 nationalities represented in the 2017 graduating class. The selection process seeks a balance between academic achievement, professional experience, international exposure, and personal motivation. Knowledge of French is not an entry requirement, but participants are highly encouraged to have a basic knowledge of French by the start of the MBA Program, while mandatory (during the first two core terms) and optional language courses are offered throughout the program. Exchange and dual degree programs are offered with about 40 international partner business schools, including the Singapore Management University, HKUST, London Business School, Columbia Business School, Wharton, and Yale.

=== Executive education ===

==== Executive MSc Innovation and Entrepreneurship ====
The Executive MSc Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship is a program created by HEC Paris and delivered partly on Coursera. 100% online, it takes 18 months. The first students were admitted in March 2017.

==== Executive MBA ====
Formerly (until 2002) Centre de perfectionnement aux affaires, the HEC Executive MBA is a program for top executives with a minimum of 8 years of corporate experience, which prepares them for general management positions (the average background experience of students is about 14 years). The Executive MBA is a multi-site program offered in Paris (France), Beijing (China), St Petersburg (Russia) and Doha (Qatar). The courses are split between theory, case studies, strategic projects, leadership training, EU community campus and foreign exchanges in the US and Asia. Program partnering universities are NYU, UCLA, Babson College in the US, Tsinghua University in China and Nihon University in Japan.

==== TRIUM Global Executive MBA ====

HEC also offers the TRIUM Global Executive MBA programme jointly with Stern School of Business of NYU and the London School of Economics. It is divided into six modules that are held in five international business locations over 16 months.

== Admissions ==

== Massive Online Open Courses ==

HEC Paris is also participating in the new wave of distance learning, by creating its own online training courses via MOOCs available on Coursera.

== Research and Entrepreneurship ==

HEC Paris has several centres of research:
* HI! PARIS CENTER - A collaboration with the &quot;Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris)&quot;, this interdisciplinary and inter-institutional centre combines education, research and innovation to investigate the major challenges surrounding digital transformation and its impact on companies and society at large. This Center combines the 300 researchers and infrastructures of IP Paris and HEC Paris.

* Society &amp; Organizations Institute - an interdisciplinary Institute that brings together over 60 professors to research, teach and implement ideas in sustainability and inclusion.

* GREGHEC - The &quot;Groupement de Recherche et d’Etudes en Gestion à HEC Paris&quot; is a joint research laboratory focused on economics and management in France.

* Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship Institute - 20 partnerships of excellence; 400 projects supported each year; an ecosystem of 400 professors, researchers and recognized experts.

The school has been offering a degree in entrepreneurship for more than 40 years, by creating HEC Entrepreneurs in 1977, which has today become the MSc X-HEC Entrepreneurs, in partnership with École Polytechnique. Between 2004 and 2013, the percentage of entrepreneurs per class jumped from 10% to 25%. In 2007, HEC Paris created Incubateur HEC Paris, its startup incubator dedicated to supporting alumni-created startups. Currently directed by Antoine Leprêtre, the incubator has been part of the Station F campus since 2017. Since 2017, the school has also an online Master&#x27;s degree dedicated to this topic.

<text>Burning Blue Soul is the debut studio album released by Matt Johnson in 1981. The album is commonly regarded as an accomplished debut, with a mix of guitar riffs, tape loops, experimental electronics and heavily filtered vocals.

The album was re-released in 1993 under Johnson&#x27;s band&#x27;s name, The The. Johnson requested that 4AD do this so that all his albums would be racked together in record stores.

Despite rumours to the contrary, all releases of &quot;Burning Blue Soul&quot; contain the same mix.

<doc id="541530" wikidata="Q4355074" url="?curid=541530" title="HMS Tiger (C20)">
<text>HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; was a conventional cruiser of the British Royal Navy, one of a three-ship class known as the . Ordered during the Second World War, she was completed after its end.

&quot;Tiger&quot; was in service by 1960 and served in the Far East and then with the Home Fleet before going into reserve at the end of 1966.

From 1968 &quot;Tiger&quot; was converted to a &quot;helicopter and command cruiser&quot; and equipped with guided missile anti-aircraft defence before returning to service in the early 1970s. She remained in service until 1978 when she was put into reserve and marked for disposal. There were moves to return her to service during the Falklands War for her flight deck capacity, but this did not proceed. &quot;Tiger&quot; was finally sold for scrap in 1986.

==Construction==
&quot;Tiger&quot; started out as &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. She was laid down in 1941 at the John Brown Shipyard as part of the of light cruisers. These vessels had a low construction priority, owing to there being more pressing requirements for other ship types during the Second World War, particularly anti-submarine vessels. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was renamed &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1945, and was launched, partially constructed, on 25 October 1945. She was christened by Lady Stansgate, the wife of William Benn, Viscount Stansgate, the Secretary of State for Air. Work on &quot;Tiger&quot; was suspended in 1946, and she was laid up at Dalmuir.

The &quot;Tiger&quot;s were redesigned in 1948, mainly for anti-aircraft defence of convoys and aircraft carrier task forces. Cruisers were seen as playing a secondary and complementary role to light fleet aircraft carriers in the defence of trade and attack on enemy shipping. For AA defence of fleet carrier task forces the cruisers replaced the AA batteries of Second World War-era battleships and carriers.

In 1951, rather than building new cruisers, the Government decided to complete the ship and two others to an altered design with all-new armament. With the revised design, HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; became the lead ship of the class. Due to the priority of the Royal Air Force (in providing defence against nuclear attack by Soviet bombers), the Cold War, and the conflict between the prime minister and Admiralty Naval Staff over shipbuilding issues, the warships that were approved in 1951-1953 were anti-submarine frigates, destroyers, and minehunters but no cruisers. The restart of work on the &quot;Tiger&quot; class and reconstruction of other cruisers was delayed until 1955.

The ship had automatic guns in twin high-angle mounts with each gun designed to fire 20 rounds per minute, and a secondary battery of automatic weapons firing at 90–120 rpm. Each 6 inch and 3 inch mounting had its own Medium Range System (MRS) 3 radar director. Viscount Hall stated in the House of Lords in 1959 that her &quot;automatically controlled&quot; guns were &quot;capable of firing at more than twice the speed of manned armament&quot; and the &quot;improvement in guns was ten times better than if the ship had been with the original gun armament&quot;. However, &quot;Tiger&quot;″s 6-inch guns usually jammed after 30 seconds firing, and couldn&#x27;t deliver sustained bombardment in support of troops ashore. RN argued that the first 30 seconds of engaging jet aircraft and warships was the critical determinant and that aircraft would be shot down with short bursts of fire and as such limited magazine capacity and gun reliability were less important than instantaneous response. The decision to complete the ships was based on the availability of hulls and expectation that the cruisers could be completed sooner (three years against five years) and cheaper (60% of the cost) than building new [8,000-ton] cruisers at a time when the existing cruiser fleet was ageing and its weapons and fire control were useless against modern aircraft. The RN had 21 cruisers in 1957, nine of which were in operation; by 1961, the cruiser fleet had reduced to nine, of which five were in service.

HMS &quot;Tiger&quot;″s revised weapon fit was for immediate post-war requirements and the continued reconstruction of the class confirmed the 1957 Defence White Paper as interim anti-aircraft ships pending the introduction of guided weapons into the Royal Navy; four County-class destroyers with the Seaslug missiles had been ordered by February 1957. In practice, only &quot;Tiger&quot; would be ready in time and perform sufficiently well to serve any length of time as a gun cruiser.

By the time &quot;Tiger&quot;″s legend was accepted by the Board of the Admiralty in July 1954 and the Cabinet in November 1954, the cruiser design, hull and machinery were really too old. Her two 6-inch turrets were insufficient to guarantee surface fire and were less effective in the anti-aircraft warfare role due to improvements in missiles and aircraft; also, the basic fit of three twin 3 inch turrets were poor for effective, reliable coverage of the fire arcs. The planned 40mm Bofors guns approved in 1954/57 as essential for close-in defence were omitted to give the crew space and comfort. Air conditioning was fitted throughout the ship, and a 200-line automatic telephone exchange was installed. Her first captain was reported in the House of Lords to have said &quot;that H.M.S. &quot;Tiger&quot; had been designed to cope with nuclear attacks, in that she can steam for up to a fortnight through radioactive fallout with remotely controlled boiler and engine and armament operating with re-circulating purified air below decks, and could operate as a fighting unit even if a nuclear bomb were dropped near by.&quot; They were described in Parliament as &quot;effective ships for a long period to come, and especially is this true east of Suez, where distances are so gigantic.&quot;

As completed, &quot;Tiger&quot; carried:
*a Type 992Q surface search radar at the top of the foremast, with a range of ,
*a Type 960 air warning radar at the top of the mainmast, with a range of ,
*a Type 277Q height-finding radar halfway up the mainmast, with a range of ,
*five MRS 3 fire control directors (one for each turret), each fitted with a Type 903 gunnery radar.
Her sonars were:
*Type 174 medium range search,
*Type 176 passive search, which shared the same dome as the Type 174,
*Type 185 underwater telephone.

The &quot;Tiger&quot;″s complement was officially stated as 698 (53 officers and 645 ratings) in peacetime, and 900 in wartime.

The &quot;Navy Estimates&quot; for 1959-60 gave her initial costs as £12,820,000, whereas &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; gave her initial cost as £13,113,000.

&quot;Tiger&quot; was accepted by the Navy in March 1959, and commissioned on 18 March 1959.

==Early career==

The early part of &quot;Tiger&quot;″s first commission was spent, under Captain R. E. Washbourn, on trials of her new armament. After workup, now under Captain R. Hutchins, &quot;Tiger&quot; went on a round of autumn flag-showing visits to Gdynia, Stockholm, Kiel and Antwerp. At the end of 1959 she deployed to the Mediterranean for a year as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. By late 1960, there were still problems with her armament and it was planned to resolve these at her first refit at the end of 1960. During a visit by the Lord Carrington (the First Lord of the Admiralty), his Naval Secretary Rear-Admiral Frank Twiss &quot;made the unpardonable error of shooting down a very expensive target aircraft, to the cheers of the ship&#x27;s company but to a stinging rebuke from their Lordships of the Admiralty.&quot; The ship took part in operations in the Far East during the Indonesian Confrontation in the early 1960s. The Navy in the early 1960s suffered manpower shortages, which resulted in a &quot;shortfall in technical personnel&quot; in the &quot;Tiger&quot;, as a consequence some &quot;items of its equipment could not be operated&quot;, and &quot;some of its equipment was not operational&quot;. In September 1963, the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; said that the &quot;Tiger already has a much-reduced crew and is virtually a floating office.&quot; During the 1964 general election campaign, the leader of the opposition, Harold Wilson, criticised the government for this during a speech at Plymouth.

Rear-Admiral Michael Pollock flew his flag in her as Flag Officer, Second-in-Command, Home Fleet, from 1965 to 1966. On 10 August 1966 one of the guns accidentally fired a practice shell into Devonport Dockyard during material tests of the equipment. &quot;One member of the ship&#x27;s company was slightly grazed, but there were no other casualties.&quot; In October 1966, the ship was visiting Cardiff at the time of the Aberfan disaster. The crew assisted with the rescue and recovery operation.

From 2 to 4 December 1966, she hosted talks between Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (UK) and Ian Smith of Rhodesia. The latter had unilaterally declared independence from Britain due to Britain&#x27;s insistence on the removal of white minority rule before independence. Twenty officers (including all twelve midshipmen) were put ashore at Gibraltar before the talks to &quot;make room for the three delegations of the Prime Minister, the Governor of Rhodesia and Mr. Smith.&quot; When the Rhodesian delegation arrived, the &quot;Tiger&quot; was a few miles off shore, and the delegation was ferried out in a small craft. The &quot;Tiger&quot; then moved out to sea, but moved close to harbour when the Rhodesian delegation disembarked. On Wilson&#x27;s orders, the British and Rhodesian delegations were &quot;separated in all activities outside the conference room&quot;.

==Conversion and later career==
&quot;Tiger&quot; was placed in reserve on 18 December 1966, before undergoing conversion to a &quot;helicopter and command cruiser&quot; from 1968–72 in HMNB Devonport. This reconstruction included removing the after 6 inch mount and 3 inch mounts, installing two Seacat missile GWS 22 mounts, and building a flight deck and hangar to operate four Westland Wessex (later Westland Sea King HAS 2) helicopters. &quot;Tiger&quot; was given much taller funnels with squared off caps, which was such an improvement that the &quot;Blake&quot; was given similar funnels in 1977.

Once converted, &quot;Tiger&quot; carried:
*a Type 992Q surface search radar at the top of the foremast, with a range of ,
*a Type 965M air warning radar with an AKE-1 single bedstead aerial at the top of the mainmast, this had a narrower beam than the Type 960, which was needed for air direction and was now the Royal Navy standard.
*a Type 278 height-finding radar halfway up the mainmast, which was similar to the Type 277Q, but easier to maintain,
*four MRS 3 fire control directors (one for each turret and Seacat mounting, each fitted with a Type 903 gunnery radar.

She had excellent command, control, and communications facilities installed, and found use as a flagship to task groups.

When plans were announced to Parliament in March 1964, it was said that the Navy did &quot;not expect this conversion work to be difficult or particularly expensive&quot;. The reconstruction of &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; was examined in the third report of the Public Accounts Committee for 1972. Michael Barnes said in parliament that the refits &quot;show too lax an attitude towards the way in which the taxpayers&#x27; money is being spent&quot;. &quot;The refits were planned to take 18 months and to cost £5 million each... The &quot;Tiger&quot; refit took over five years and cost over £13 million.&quot; Rear-Admiral Morgan-Giles, MP for Winchester, while advocating for the carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; to be brought back into commission, described &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; as &quot;among the worst abortions which have ever been thrust on the Royal Navy&quot;.

The ship&#x27;s helicopter squadron increased the ship&#x27;s peacetime complement to 885 (85 officers and 800 ratings), which put a strain on accommodation for the crew.

During reconstruction and in the following years, material cannibalised from &quot;Lion&quot; was used to patch both &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot;. &quot;Tiger&quot; reportedly had so much material from &quot;Lion&quot; that her crew nicknamed her &quot;HMS Liger&quot;.

She was recommissioned on 6 May 1972. Her large crew made her an expensive ship to operate and maintain. When the economic difficulties of the late seventies came around, this led to a defence manpower drawdown that resulted in manpower shortages; although &quot;Tiger&quot; remained in service long enough to take part in the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

In 1978 &quot;Tiger&quot; was placed in reserve, and decommissioned on 4 May 1979. She was put on the disposal list in 1979. Both &quot;Tiger&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Blake&quot; were listed as part of the Standby Squadron, and moored inactive at HMNB Chatham.

When the Falklands War broke out in early April 1982, both ships were rapidly surveyed and it was determined both were in very good material shape, and both were immediately drydocked (&quot;Tiger&quot; in Portsmouth and &quot;Blake&quot; at Chatham) and recommissioning work was begun.

Whilst there was speculation that their 6-inch guns would be useful for shore bombardment, the real reason for their potential deployment was the size of their flight decks (at the time the third-largest in the Royal Navy after the aircraft carriers and ), and the potential to use them as mobile forward operating and refuelling bases for Task Force Harriers. (&quot;Blake&quot; had already operated RAF Harriers briefly for proving trials in 1971, and Harriers had refuelled on &quot;Tiger&quot;). Their benefit would be more as platforms to extend the range and endurance of the Harriers and as a refuelling stop on the way back to the carriers, rather than as somewhere to operate offensive missions from, or as somewhere to place a pair of Sea Harriers as an extended-range Combat Air Patrol ahead of the two carriers (and reducing their own exposure to air strikes), but the need to take off vertically rather than the use of a ski-jump severely reduced the Harriers&#x27; endurance and weapons carrying capability, and in late May 1982 after the loss of the destroyer and the Argentinian cruiser the refits were stopped.

There were also doubts about the two ships&#x27; self-defence capabilities, (the 6-inch and 3-inch armament had never been reliable) and this coupled with the large complement (and potential loss of life if one of the cruisers was to be lost), caused much anxiety in the Admiralty. That, along with where to find 1,800 capable and qualified crew in a hurry at a time when the Royal Navy was already down-sizing, sealed the two ships&#x27; fate. The UK simply could not afford its own &quot;Belgrano&quot; disaster, either materially or politically.

Although Chile showed a faint interest in acquiring &quot;Tiger&quot; and sister-ship &quot;Blake&quot;, this did not get past the discussion stage and &quot;Tiger&quot; lingered on, moored in Portsmouth harbour. &quot;Tiger&quot; existed in a slowly deteriorating condition until mid-1986, and following competitive tendering she was sold for scrap to Desguaces Varela of Spain. She was towed to Spain and scrapping started in October 1986.

<doc id="541534" wikidata="Q273019" url="?curid=541534" title="Greet Hofmans">
<text>Greet Hofmans (23 June 1894 – 16 November 1968) was a Dutch faith healer and &quot;hand layer&quot;. For nine years she was a friend and advisor of Queen Juliana, often residing at Palace Soestdijk. She became the former Dutch queen&#x27;s confidante in the 1950s, but was removed from the royal court after an affair that in the Netherlands is often referred to by her name, the &quot;Greet Hofmans affair&quot;.

== Court crisis 1948–1956 ==

Hofmans was introduced at the Dutch Royal Court on the initiative of Prince Bernhard in 1948 to treat the eye sickness of Princess Maria Christina. This illness arose after Juliana was infected with rubella during the pregnancy. Hofmans developed a great influence on the queen, encouraging pacifist ideas. In the period of the Cold War this caused a crisis in the royal household. Reputedly it reached the point where it threatened the marriage of Juliana and Bernhard. This crisis, which lasted to 1956, split the Dutch court into two camps. On the one side were Juliana and other admirers of Hofmans. On the other side were her husband Prince Bernhard, his supporters and the children of him and Juliana, including the later Dutch queen, Beatrix.

Outside the Netherlands, a great deal was written and speculated about the Hofmans affair. On 13 June 1956 an article appeared in the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; subtitled &quot;Zwischen Königin und Rasputin&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Between queen and Rasputin&quot;. Reportedly it was Bernhard who provided the information for the article, by which means he hoped to have Hofmans removed from the court.

The British newspaper &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; with headline: &quot;Royal Crisis over A Faith-Healer&quot;.

== Beel Commission, 1956 ==

The cabinet of Willem Drees banned the import of the edition of the German magazine and on 28 June 1956 appointed a commission of enquiry of former ministers (Louis Beel and Gerbrandy) and former governor-general of the Dutch East Indies A. W. L. Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer: the Beel Commission. The outcome was the termination of Hofmans&#x27; contacts with the court and the reorganisation of the royal household.

Through the secrecy imposed on the official side and the self-censorship of the Dutch press, the Hofmans affair took on a life of its own. Some have speculated that the affair was simply a mask for a looming divorce of the royal couple.

Hofmans retained until her death followers of the higher circles, who saw in her the personification of the ideal life: sober, peaceful, free of self-interest, and directed at one&#x27;s fellow man. Others viewed her, however, as a charlatan, an intrigant, and a dangerous &quot;witch&quot;, or at best a naive figure. She kept treating patients till she died from cancer in 1968. She was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery.

On 7 February 2004 Bernhard wrote in an open letter to the &quot;Volkskrant&quot; newspaper:

&quot;with respect to the so-named Hofmans affair, I recall that the Beel Commission in 1956 conducted an exhaustive investigation. The report of this commission is for formal reasons still not public, therefore I express here my confidence that the eventual publication will place all those involved in this complex affair in the correct light&quot;.
== Fasseur study 2008 ==

In November 2008, the Dutch historian Cees Fasseur revealed in his book &quot;Juliana &amp; Bernhard. Story of a marriage, 1936–1956&quot; that Hofmans left the Dutch royal court in 1956 after receiving a letter warning that both she and Queen Juliana’s private secretary Walraven van Heeckeren would be &quot;assassinated if she did not leave “voluntarily&quot;. The existence of the anonymous letter, signed by &quot;the Action Committee&quot;, was kept secret until that publication. However, it was known that two members of former Dutch resistance groups had sent a letter to Queen Juliana’s mother, Wilhelmina, suggesting a violent solution for the crisis within the monarchy caused by the Hofmans’ closeness to Queen Juliana.

Author Fasseur said he did not know if Bernhard, who had close ties with the former resistance, knew about the liquidation threat – or if he perhaps gave the order to send such a threat himself. Fasseur was the first who was granted permission by the then Queen Beatrix to read files related to the affair, that had been kept in the royal archives along with the 1956 secret report of the Beel Commission. The long-secret report of the commission appeared as an appendix to Fasseur’s book in 2008.

The &quot;Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij&quot; (Dutch association against charlatans, or quackery) has ranked Hofmans in the 14th place of the top twenty charlatans of the 20th century in the Netherlands.

<doc id="541538" wikidata="Q750900" url="?curid=541538" title="SPOT (satellite)">
<text>SPOT (, lit. &quot;Satellite for observation of Earth&quot;) is a commercial high-resolution optical Earth imaging satellite system operating from space. It is run by Spot Image, based in Toulouse, France. It was initiated by the CNES (&quot;Centre national d&#x27;études spatiales&quot; – the French space agency) in the 1970s and was developed in association with the SSTC (Belgian scientific, technical and cultural services) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). It has been designed to improve the knowledge and management of the Earth by exploring the Earth&#x27;s resources, detecting and forecasting phenomena involving climatology and oceanography, and monitoring human activities and natural phenomena. The SPOT system includes a series of satellites and ground control resources for satellite control and programming, image production, and distribution. Earlier satellites were launched using the European Space Agency&#x27;s Ariane 2, 3, and 4 rockets, while SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 were launched by the Indian PSLV.

==List of satellites==
SPOT Image is marketing the high-resolution images, which SPOT can take from every corner of the Earth.
* SPOT 1 launched February 22, 1986 with 10 panchromatic and 20 meter multispectral picture resolution capability. Withdrawn December 31, 1990.
* SPOT 2 launched January 22, 1990 and deorbited in July 2009.
* SPOT 3 launched September 26, 1993. Stopped functioning November 14, 1997.
* SPOT 4 launched March 24, 1998. Stopped functioning July, 2013. 
* SPOT 5 launched May 4, 2002 with 2.5 m, 5 m and 10 m capability. Stopped functioning March 31, 2015.
* SPOT 6 launched September 9, 2012.
* SPOT 7 (Azersky) launched on June 30, 2014. Stopped functioning March 17, 2023.

== Orbit ==
The SPOT orbit is polar, circular, Sun-synchronous, and phased. The inclination of the orbital plane combined with the rotation of the Earth around the polar axis allows the satellite to fly over any point on Earth within 26 days. The orbit has an altitude of , an inclination of 98.7°, and completing 14 + 5/26 revolutions per day.

== Generations ==
=== SPOT 1, 2, and 3 ===
Since 1986 the SPOT family of satellites has been orbiting the Earth and has already taken more than 10 million high quality images. SPOT 1 was launched with the last Ariane 1 rocket on February 22, 1986. Two days later, the SPOT 1 transmitted its first image with a spatial resolution of . SPOT 2 joined SPOT 1 in orbit on January 22, 1990, on the Ariane 4 maiden flight, and SPOT 3 followed on September 26, 1993, also on an Ariane 4.

The satellite loads were identical, each including two identical HRV (High Resolution Visible) imaging instruments that were able to operate in two modes, either simultaneously or individually. The two spectral modes are panchromatic and multispectral. The panchromatic band has a resolution of , and the three multispectral bands (G, R, NIR) have resolutions of s. They have a scene size of and a revisit interval of one to four days, depending on the latitude.

Because the orbit of SPOT 1 was lowered in 2003, it will gradually lose altitude and break up naturally in the atmosphere. Deorbiting of SPOT 2, in accordance with Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), commenced in mid-July 2009 for a period of two weeks, with a final burn on 29 July 2009. SPOT 3 is no longer functioning, due to problems with its stabilization system.

=== SPOT 4 ===
SPOT 4 launched March 24, 1998 and stopped functioning July, 2013. In 2013, CNES lowered the altitude of SPOT 4 by to put it on a phased orbit with a five-day repeat cycle. On this orbit, SPOT4 was programmed to acquire a time-lapse series of images over 42 sites with a five days revisit period from February to end of May 2013. The data set it produced is aimed at helping future users of the Sentinel-2 mission to learn working with time-lapse series. The time-lapse series provided by SPOT4 (Take5) have the same repetitiveness as those that will be delivered by the Sentinel-2 satellites, starting in 2015 and 2016.

=== SPOT 5 ===
SPOT 5 was launched on May 4, 2002, and has the goal to ensure continuity of services for customers and to improve the quality of data and images by anticipating changes in market requirements.

SPOT 5 has two high resolution geometrical (HRG) instruments that were deduced from the HRVIR of SPOT 4. They offer a higher resolution of 2.5 to 5 meters in panchromatic mode and 10 meters in multispectral mode (20 metre on short wave infrared 1.58 – 1.75 μm). SPOT 5 also features an HRS imaging instrument operating in panchromatic mode. HRS points forward and backward of the satellite. Thus, it is able to take stereopair images almost simultaneously to map relief.

=== SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 ===
SPOT 6 was launched by India&#x27;s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on flight C21 at 04:23 UTC on 9 September 2012, while SPOT 7 was launched on PSLV flight C23 at 04:42 UTC on 30 June 2014. They form a constellation of Earth-imaging satellites designed to provide continuity of high-resolution, wide-swath data up to 2024. EADS Astrium decided to build this constellation in 2009 on the basis of a perceived government need for this kind of data. Spot Image, a subsidiary of Astrium, funded the satellites alone and owned the system (satellites and ground segments) at time of launch. In December 2014, SPOT 7 was sold to Azerbaijan&#x27;s space agency Azercosmos, who renamed it &quot;Azersky&quot;.

*The architecture is similar to that of the Pleiades satellites, with a centrally mounted optical instrument, a three-axis star tracker, a fiber-optic gyro (FOG) and four control moment gyros (CMGs).
*SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 are phased in the same orbit as Pléiades 1A and Pléiades 1B at an altitude of , forming a constellation of 2-by-2 satellites - 90° apart from one another.
*Image product resolution:
**Panchromatic: 1.5 m
**Colour merge: 1.5 m
**Multi-spectral: 6 m
*Spectral bands, with simultaneous panchromatic and multi-spectral acquisitions:
**Panchromatic (450 – 745 nm)
**Blue (450 – 525 nm)
**Green (530 – 590 nm)
**Red (625 – 695 nm)
**Near-infrared (760 – 890 nm)
*Footprint: 60 km × 60 km
*Responsive satellite tasking, with six tasking plans per day, per satellite
*Capacity to acquire up to 3 million km2 daily

<text>The Eyalet of Rûm (; ; originally Arabic for Eastern Roman Empire), later named as the Eyalet of Sivas (; ), was an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire in northern Anatolia, founded following Bayezid I&#x27;s conquest of the area in the 1390s. The capital was the city of Amasya, which was then moved to Tokat and later to Sivas. Its reported area in the 19th century was .

Rûm was the old Seljuk Turkish designation for Anatolia, referring to the Eastern Roman Empire, and in European texts as late as the 19th-century the word Rûm (or Roum) was used to denote the whole of central Anatolia, not just the smaller area comprising the Ottoman province (see Sultanate of Rum).

==History==
In the 14th century several autonomous towns (Amasya, Tokat, Sivas) were established, despite the continued Seljukid-Mongol rule in central Asia Minor.

When the Ilkhanid ruler Ebu Said died in 1335, administration of Asia Minor was entrusted to his former governor Eretna Bey, a Uyghur. Eretna Bey ultimately declared independence, seeking the protection of the Mamluks, who were rivals of the Ilkhanids. He captured the area around Sivas-Kayseri, eventually establishing an emirate of Eretna, which grew stronger during the rule of his son, Mehmed Bey.

In 1381 Kadı Burhaneddin a kadı in Kayseri who was also appointed vizier to represent the emirate of Eretna in that town, replaced the Eretnid as ruler of Sivas and also captured Amasya and Tokat. His principality managed to resist interference in central Anatolia from both the Akkoyunlus and the Ottomans until it collapsed with his death in 1398.

==Administrative divisions==
According to Evliya Çelebi, the eyalet of Sivas had the following sanjaks in the 17th century:
# Sivas Sanjak (&quot;Sívás&quot;, Sivas)
# Divriği Sanjak (&quot;Deverbegi&quot;, Divriği)
# Çorum Sanjak (&quot;Khúrúm&quot;, Çorum)
# Keskin Sanjak (&quot;Keskín&quot;, Keskin)
# Bozok Sanjak (&quot;Buzúk&quot;, Yozgat)
# Amasya Sanjak (&quot;Amasia&quot;, Amasya)
# Tokat Sanjak (&quot;Tokát&quot;, Tokat)
# Zila Sanjak (&quot;Zíla&quot;, Zile)
# Canik Sanjak (&quot;Janík&quot;, Samsun)
# Arabgir Sanjak (&quot;Arab-gír&quot;, Arapgir)

The eyalet of Sivas consisted of seven sanjaks between 1700 and 1740:
# Sanjak of &quot;Sivas&quot; (&quot;Paşa Sancağı&quot;, Sivas)
# Sanjak of &quot;Amasya&quot; (Amasya)
# Sanjak of Janik (&quot;Canik Sancağı&quot;, Samsun)
# Sanjak of Diwriji (&quot;Divriği Sancağı&quot;, Divriği)
# Sanjak of Arabgir (&quot;Arabgir Sancağı&quot;, Arapgir)
# Sanjak of Chorum (&quot;Çorum Sancağı&quot;, Çorum)
# Sanjak of Bozok (&quot;Bozok Sancağı&quot;, Yozgat)

<text>The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium (RASAB) is a non-governmental association that promotes and organises science and the arts in Belgium by coordinating the national and international activities of its constituent academies such as the National Scientific Committees and the representation of Belgium in international scientific organisations.

The RASAB was formed as a non-profit organization (Association without lucrative purpose) in 2001 by the Dutch-speaking academy KVAB (Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten i.e. &quot;Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts&quot;) and by the French-speaking academy ARB ( i.e. &quot;The Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium&quot;).

The association is headquartered in the buildings of the former Royal Stables at the Academy Palace, Hertogsstraat 1 Rue Ducale B-1000 Brussels.

== History ==

=== Academies ===

The RASAB was founded in 2001 by the two Belgian academies that are connected through their working language either to the Flemish community or to the French community of Belgium as a collaborative association with the aim of promoting the science and the arts on a national and international level in Belgium. To meet this demand, the academies organise scientific and cultural activities, they try to stimulate cooperation between universities in Belgium, they assure Belgian representation in international organisations and forums, they attract foreign researchers, they give recommendations and advice to institutions involved in government, industry, education and research, and they give prizes to talented researchers and artists.

The Belgian academies are successor institutions to the Imperial and Royal Academy of Brussels established in 1772 by Georg Adam, Prince of Starhemberg, minister plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands during the reign of Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa.

=== RASAB ===
The RASAB was founded in 2001 in order to coordinate the national and international activities for which the Académie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux- Arts de Belgique (ARB) and the Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten (KVAB) have a mutual responsibility.

== Mission and goals ==
The RASAB has the following responsibilities and duties:
* to coordinate and, if necessary, create national deliberative assemblies, such as the National Committees;
* to pay the memberships to international institutions where both Academies are members of;
* to provide funds to make sure that Belgian representatives are present at the General Assemblies and other meetings of these international institutions, because presence is required due to the membership of Belgium in these organisations;
* to provide Belgian representation in those scientific, artistic and cultural international organisations where KVAB and ARB are members of and which accept only one representative from each country;
* to improve the international cooperation between individual scientists by reimbursing travel- and accommodation costs;
* to fulfil assignments where both academies are responsible for.

The articles of the RASAB were published in the Belgian Official Journal from the 19th of April 2001. The association is headquartered in the former stables of the Palace of Academies in Brussels, nearby the Royal Palace and the Warandepark.

== National scientific committees ==
The assignment of the National Committees is the promotion and coordination for Belgium of the studies of different scientific disciplines that are within their competences, mainly from an international point of view. Each National Committee focuses on a specific scientific study. There are 24 committees. Members of these committees are doctors, professors and people working within a specific scientific field.

The conditions for the foundation of a National Committee is the existence of an international scientific union that is a member of the International Council for Science or a member of a scientific institution of the International Council for Science (scientific committees, special committees...) in the same scientific discipline.

The RASAB is responsible for the financial and logistic support of the National Committees, as well for its daily activities, as for the organisation of scientific events by the National Committees in the Palace of Academies.

== International relations ==
=== ALLEA ===
All European Academies (ALLEA) is the European Federation of National Academies of Sciences and Humanities. Currently, there are 53 Academies from 40 European countries in this federation.

ALLEA Member Academies are self-governing communities of scientists and researchers, and operate as learned societies, think-tanks, grant givers, and research performing organisations.

The goals of ALLEA are:
* promotes the exchange of information and experiences between its Member Academies;
* offers European science and society advice from its Member Academies;
* strives for excellence in science and scholarship, for high ethical standards in the conduct of research, and for independence from political, commercial and ideological interests.

=== EASAC ===
The European Academies&#x27; Science Advisory Council (EASAC) is formed by the National Academies of the European Union&#x27;s Member States.

EASAC provides a cooperation between the Academies with the aim of providing scientific advice to the European policy makers. In that way, EASAC makes it possible for the European scientists to be heard as one voice.

In this way, EASAC has the opportunity to fulfil the vision of the Academies, namely that science plays a key role in many aspects of modern life and the recognition of this scientific aspect is a prerequisite for wise political decisions. This vision is part of the foundation of many National Academies. Given the increasing role of the European Union in the political arena, the National Academies acknowledge that the scope of their advisory tasks must exceed the national borders and that it&#x27;s important not to lose sight of the European level.

Since April 2010, the official contact for EASAC in Brussels is the RASAB&#x27;s liaison office. There is an intense cooperation between the RASAB and the secretariat and board of EASAC.

==== RASAB&#x27;s liaison office ====
The Belgian Academies have the advantage of being located in the heart of Brussels, at walking distance from the European institutions. Given the context a liaison office was founded within the RASAB, which makes sure that the advice from the Belgian as well as the European academies are heard by the European policy makers.

The office has the following responsibilities and duties:
* to gather information on the upcoming EU policy measures, which may benefit from an independent scientific and technical guidance.
* to increase the visibility of the Belgian and European Academies and its global umbrella organisations as a source of independent, peer-reviewed and scientific information of high quality to develop policy measures.
* to establish a more regular contact with key figures in the European Commission, the Parliament and the Council, who show an interest in science and technique as an input for policy preparations.
* to organise meetings between key figures of the Academies with those from the European Institutions.

=== IAP ===
InterAcademy Panel (IAP) is a worldwide network of National Academies of Science. The Panel was founded in 1993.

The main objective is to promote the cooperation between its Member Academies and to give advice to its citizens and their governments when it comes to scientific aspects of worldwide concerns.

IAP especially focuses on helping out the smaller and younger Academies to obtain these objectives. All Academies will be more efficient when it comes to increasing their influence and spreading their advice and warnings amongst their citizens and politicians through communication connections and networks created by the IAP-activities.

=== I.H.R Network ===
De International Human Rights Network (IHR) of Academies and Scholarly Societies helps scientists, engineers and physicians all over the world who are victims of severe repression, just because of the nonviolent use of their rights as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

IHR also supports the awareness of the human rights and institutional commitment to the human rights in het national academies and the scientific communities worldwide.

=== UAI ===
De Union Académique Internationale (UAI, &quot;The International Union of Academies&quot;) is an organisation of many national academies from more than 60 countries and several international academies.

The UAI works to promote the advancement of knowledge, development of scientific exchanges and initiatives of its academies. The increasing number of projects, by its willingness to accommodate more members of academies, the International Academic Union and aims to represent the principle of excellence that animates it.

<text>OJ, formerly named OpenJava, is a programming tool that parses and analyzes Java source code. It uses a metaobject protocol (MOP) to provide services for language extensions. Michiaki Tatsubori was the lead developer of OpenJava. Its first release was back to 1997, and won the Student Encouragement Prize at the Java Conference Grandprix &#x27;97 held in Japan.

This isn&#x27;t to be confused with OpenJDK, which is the open source release of the Java compiler runtime and tools.

OpenJava was renamed OJ in October 2007 at the request of Sun Microsystems.

From the mid 14th century until its fall in 1487, the Karamanid dynasty was one of the most powerful beyliks in Anatolia.
==History==

The Karamanids traced their ancestry from Hodja Sad al-Din and his son Nure Sufi Bey, who emigrated from Arran (roughly encompassing modern-day Azerbaijan) to Sivas because of the Mongol invasion in 1230.

The Karamanids were members of the Salur tribe of Oghuz Turks. According to others, they were members of the Afshar tribe, which participated in the revolt led by Baba Ishak and afterwards moved to the western Taurus Mountains, near the town of Larende, where they came to serve the Seljuks. Nure Sofi worked there as a woodcutter. His son, Kerîmeddin Karaman Bey, gained tenuous control over the mountainous parts of Cilicia in the middle of the 13th century. A persistent but spurious legend, however, claims that the Seljuq Sultan of Rum, Kayqubad I, instead established a Karamanid dynasty in these lands.

Karaman Bey expanded his territories by capturing castles in Ermenek, Mut, Ereğli, Gülnar, and Silifke. The year of the conquests is reported as 1225, during the reign of Ala al-Din Kaykubadh I (1220–1237), which seems excessively early. Karaman Bey&#x27;s conquests were mainly at the expense of the Kingdom of Lesser Armenia (and perhaps at the expense of Rukn al-Din Kilij Arslan IV, 1248–1265); in any case it is certain that he fought against the Kingdom of Lesser Armenia (and probably even died in this fight) to such extent that King Hethum I (1226–1269) had to place himself voluntarily under the sovereignty of the great Khan, in order to protect his kingdom from Mamluks and Seljuks (1244).

The rivalry between Kilij Arslan IV and Izz al-Din Kaykaus II allowed the tribes in the border areas to live virtually independently. Karaman Bey helped Kaykaus, but Arslan had the support of both the Mongols and Pervâne Sulayman Muin al-Din (who had the real power in the sultanate).

The Mongolian governor and general Baiju was dismissed from office in 1256 because he had failed to conquer new territories. Still, he continued to serve as a general and appeared, the same year, fighting the Sultan of Rum, who had not paid the tax, and he managed to defeat the sultan a second time. Rukn al-Din Kilidj Arslan IV got rid of almost all hostile begs and amirs except Karaman Bey, to whom he gave the town of Larende (now Karaman, in honour of the dynasty) and Ermenek (c. 1260) in order to win him to his side. In the meantime, Bunsuz, brother of Karaman Bey, was chosen as a &quot;Candar&quot;, or bodyguard, for Kilij Arslan IV. Their power rose as a result of the unification of Turkish clans that lived in the mountainous regions of Cilicia with the new Turkish population transferred there by Kayqubad.

Good relations between the Seljuqs and the Karamanids did not last. In 1261, on the pretext of supporting Kaykaus II, who had fled to Constantinople as a result of the intrigues of the chancellor Mu&#x27;in al-Din Suleyman, the Pervane, Karaman Bey and his two brothers, Zeynül-Hac and Bunsuz, marched toward Konya, the Seljuq capital, with 20,000 men. A combined Seljuq and Mongol army, led by the Pervane, defeated the Karamanid army and captured Karaman Bey&#x27;s two brothers.

After Karaman Bey died in 1262, his older son, Mehmet I of Karaman, became the head of the house. He immediately negotiated alliances with other Turkmen clans to raise an army against the Seljuqs and Ilkhanids. During the 1276 revolt of Hatıroğlu Şemseddin Bey against Mongol domination in Anatolia, Karamanids also defeated several Mongol-Seljuq armies. In the Battle of Göksu in 1277 in particular, the central power of the Seljuq was dealt a severe blow. Taking advantage of the general confusion, Mehmed Bey captured Konya on 12 May and placed on the throne a pretender called Jimri, who claimed to be the son of Kaykaus. In the end, however, Mehmed was defeated by Seljuq and Mongol forces and executed with some of his brothers in 1278.

Despite these blows, the Karamanids continued to increase their power and influence, largely aided by the Mamluks of Egypt, especially during the reign of Baybars. Karamanids captured Konya on two more occasions at the beginning of the 14th century but were driven out the first time by emir Chupan, the Ilkhanid governor of Anatolia, and the second time by Chupan&#x27;s son and successor Timurtash. An expansion of Karamanoğlu power occurred after the fall of the Ilkhanids in the 1330s. A second expansion coincided with Karamanoğlu Alâeddin Ali Bey&#x27;s marriage to Nefise Hatun, the daughter of the Ottoman sultan Murat I, the first important contact between the two dynasties.

As Ottoman power expanded into the Balkans, Aleaddin Ali Bey captured the city of Beyşehir, which had been an Ottoman city. However, it did not take much time for the Ottomans to react and march on Konya, the Karamanoğlu capital city. A treaty between the two kingdoms was formed, and peace existed until the reign of Bayezid I.

Timur gave control of the Karamanid lands to Mehmet Bey, the oldest son of Aleaddin Ali Bey. After Bayezid I died in 1403, the Ottoman Empire went into a political crisis as the Ottoman family fell prey to internecine strife. It was an opportunity not only for Karamanids but also for all of the Anatolian &quot;beyliks&quot;. Mehmet Bey assembled an army to march on Bursa. He captured the city and damaged it; this would not be the last Karamanid invasion of Ottoman lands. However, Mehmet Bey was captured by Bayezid Pasha and sent to prison. He apologized for what he had done and was forgiven by the Ottoman ruler.

Ramazanoğlu Ali Bey captured Tarsus while Mehmet Bey was in prison. Mustafa Bey, son of Mehmet Bey, retook the city during a conflict between the Emirs of Sham and Egypt. After that, the Egyptian sultan Sayf ad-Din Inal sent an army to retake Tarsus from the Karamanids. The Egyptian Mamluks damaged Konya after defeating the Karamanids, and Mehmet Bey retreated from Konya. Ramazanoğlu Ali Bey pursued and captured him; according to an agreement between the two leaders, Mehmet Bey was exiled to Egypt for the rest of his life.

During the Crusade of Varna against the Ottomans in 1443–44, Karamanid İbrahim Bey marched on Ankara and Kütahya, destroying both cities. In the meantime, the Ottoman sultan Murad II was returning from Rumelia with a victory against the Hungarian Crusaders. Like all other Islamic emirates in Anatolia, the Karamanids were accused of treason. Hence, İbrahim Bey accepted all Ottoman terms. The Karamanid state was eventually terminated by the Ottomans in 1487, as the power of their Mameluke allies was declining. Some were resettled in various parts of Anatolia. Large groups were accommodated in northern Iran on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. The main part was brought to the newly conquered territories in north-eastern Bulgaria – the Ludogorie region, another group – to what is now northern Greece and southern Bulgaria— present-day Kardzhali region and Macedonia. Ottomans founded Karaman Eyalet from former territories of Karamanids.

==Power of the Karamanid state in Anatolia==
According to Mesâlik-ül-Ebsâr, written by Şehâbeddin Ömer, the Karamanid army had 25,000 riders and 25,000 saracens. They could also rely on some Turkmen tribes and their warriors.

Their economic activities depended mostly on control of strategic commercial areas such as Konya, Karaman and the ports of Lamos, Silifke, Anamur, and Manavgat.

==Karamanid architecture==

66 mosques, 8 hammams, 2 caravanserais and 3 medreses built by the Karamanids survived to the present day. Notable examples of Karamanid architecture include:
* Hasbey Medrese (1241)
* Şerafettin Mosque (13th century)
* İnce Minare (Dar-ül Hadis) Medrese (1258–1279)
* Hatuniye Medrese (Karaman)
* Mevlana Mosque and Tomb in Konya
* Mader-i Mevlana (Aktekke) mosque in Karaman
* Ibrahim Bey Mosque (Imaret) in Karaman

<doc id="541568" wikidata="Q879080" url="?curid=541568" title="Rogation days">
<text>Rogation days are days of prayer and fasting in Western Christianity. They are observed with processions and the Litany of the Saints. The so-called &quot;major&quot; rogation is held on 25 April; the &quot;minor&quot; rogations are held on Monday to Wednesday preceding Ascension Thursday. The word &quot;rogation&quot; comes from the Latin verb , meaning &quot;to ask&quot;, which reflects the beseeching of God for the appeasement of his anger and for protection from calamities.

Rogation Sunday is celebrated on the 5th Sunday after Easter (also known as the 6th Sunday of Easter) in the Anglican tradition. This day is also known in the Lutheran tradition as Rogate Sunday.

== Christian beginnings ==
The Christian major rogation replaced a pagan Roman procession known as Robigalia, at which a dog was sacrificed to propitiate Robigus, the deity of agricultural disease. The practitioners observing Robigalia asked Robigus for protection of their crops from wheat rust.

The minor Rogation days were introduced around AD 470 by Mamertus, bishop of Vienne, and eventually adopted elsewhere. Their observance was ordered by the Council of Orleans in 511, and though the practice was spreading in Gaul during the 7th century, it was not officially adopted into the Roman rite until the reign of Pope Leo III (died 816).

The faithful typically observed the Rogation days by fasting and abstinence in preparation to celebrate the Ascension, and farmers often had their crops blessed by a priest at this time. Violet vestments are worn at the rogation litany and its associated Mass, regardless of what colour is worn at the ordinary liturgies of the day.

A common feature of Rogation days in former times was the ceremony of beating the bounds, in which a procession of parishioners, led by the minister, churchwarden, and choirboys, would proceed around the boundary of their parish and pray for its protection in the forthcoming year. This was also known in the northern parts of England as &#x27;Gang-day&#x27; or &#x27;gan week&#x27;, after the old English name for going or walking. This was also a feature of the original Roman festival, when revellers would walk to a grove five miles from the city to perform their rites. Thomas Johnson (1633), speaking of the birch tree, mentions another name: Cross-week: &quot;It serveth well to the decking up of houses and banquetting-rooms, for places of pleasure, and for beautifying of streets in the Crosse or Gang Week, and such like.&quot;

==In the British Isles==

The Rogation Day ceremonies are thought to have arrived in the British Isles in the 7th century.

The oldest known Sarum text regarding Rogation Days is dated from around 1173 to 1220. In it, celebrations in the south of England are described, in which processions were led by members of the congregation carrying banners which represented various biblical characters. At the head of the procession was the dragon, representing Pontius Pilate, which would be followed by a lion, representing Christ. After this there would be images of saints carried by the rest of the congregation. Many torches were present at each procession, weighing between 42 lb (19 kg) and 27 lbs (12 kg), which were bought by the church and parishioners jointly.

Sarum texts from the 13th and 15th centuries show that the dragon was eventually moved to the rear of the procession on the vigil of the Ascension, with the lion taking the place at the front. Illustrations of the procession from the early 16th century show that the arrangements had been changed yet again, this time also showing bearers of reliquaries and incense.

During the reign of King Henry VIII, Rogation processions were used as a way to assist crop yields, with a notable number of the celebrations taking place in 1543 when there were prolonged rains.

During the reign of King Edward VI, the Crown having taken much of the Church&#x27;s holdings within the country, liturgical ceremonies were not officially condoned or recognized as an official part of worship. However, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I the celebrations were explicitly mentioned in the royal reformation, allowing them to resume as public processions.

Rogation processions continued in the post-Reformation Church of England much as they had before, and Anglican priests were encouraged to bring their congregations together for inter-parish processions. At specific intervals, clerics were to remind their congregations to be thankful for their harvests. Psalms 103 and 104 were sung, and people were reminded of the curses the Bible ascribed to those who violated agricultural boundaries. The processions were not mandatory, but were at the discretion of the local minister, and were also ascribed more importance when a public right of way needed to be protected from agricultural or other expansion.

The marches would follow prescribed routes, with York and Coventry being unique in their following royal entries. On other routes, altars were erected at certain locations where antiphons were sung.

Any Roman Catholic imagery or icons were banned from the processions. The then Archdeacon of Essex, Grindal of London, besought the church explicitly to label the tradition as a perambulation of the parish boundaries (beating the bounds), further to distance it from the Catholic liturgy. In the book &quot;Second Tome of Homelys&quot;, a volume containing officially sanctioned homilies of the Elizabethan church, it was made clear that the English Rogation was to remember town and other communal boundaries in a social and historical context, with extra emphasis on the stability gained from lawful boundary lines.

For years after Rogation Days were recognized, the manner in which they were observed in reality was very different from the official decree. Even before religious sensibilities turned towards the puritanical, there were concerns about the lack of piety at such events. While it was officially ordered that the entire congregation attend, bishops began urging their priests to invite only older and more pious men. This, they believed, would stop the drunken revelry. Royal Injunctions concerning the practice were reinterpreted to restrict and regulate participants of the festivities. Robert Herrick penned a piece to capture the mood of the celebrations before their repression:

In London, Rogation Days, just like Easter or Hocktide, were times when begging was &quot;legitimate&quot; for the period of celebration. Though not widely celebrated in the modern Church of England, the holiday is still observed in some areas.

==In the Americas==
===Catholic===
The reform of the Liturgical Calendar for Roman Catholics in 1969 delegated the establishment of Rogation Days, along with Ember Days, to the episcopal conferences. Their observance in the Latin Church subsequently declined, but the observance has revived somewhat since Pope John Paul II allowed Rogation days as a permitted, but not mandated, observance. For those Catholics who continue to celebrate Mass according to the General Roman Calendar of 1960 or earlier, the Rogation Days are still kept, unless a higher ranking feast would occur on the day.

===Anglican===
The new, Protestant version of the Rogation days became such a fixture in Church life that the tradition was carried over to the English churches across the British Empire, including to the Americas by British colonists in Bermuda, Jamaica, Barbados, Virginia and South Carolina. Rogation days continue as an optional observance in the Episcopal Church, and in Anglican Provinces around the world. Although early Rogation celebrations were associated with rural life, agriculture and fishing, the Book of Common Prayer in many jurisdictions has been expanded to include propers for commerce and industry and the stewardship of creation, as well as a fruitful season, and rubrics were added for their use.

<text>John Harold Williamson (June 7, 1937 – April 11, 2021) was a British-born economist who coined the term Washington Consensus. He served as a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics from 1981 until his retirement in 2012. During that time, he was the project director for the United Nations High-Level Panel on Financing for Development in 2001. He was also on leave as chief economist for South Asia at the World Bank during 1996–99, adviser to the International Monetary Fund from 1972 to 1974, and an economic consultant to the UK Treasury from 1968 to 1970. He was also an economics professor at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (1978–81), University of Warwick (1970–77), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1967, 1980), University of York (1963–68) and Princeton University (1962–63).

He is best known for defining the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; in 1989. He made 10 rules that were imposed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the US government on developing nations. He came to strongly oppose the way those recommendations were actually imposed and their use by neoliberals.

==Early life and education==
John Harold Williamson was born in Hereford in 1937. He graduated from Hereford High School for Boys and had originally planned to study civil engineering. However, his headmaster convinced him to do economics and he decided to attend the London School of Economics. He graduated with a B.Sc. in economics in 1958.

Following graduation, Williamson served two years of compulsory military service in the Royal Air Force. He conducted operations research at the Department of the Scientific Adviser to the Air Ministry in Whitehall. He then attended graduate school at Princeton University, graduating with a Ph.D. in Economics in 1963. He was influenced by courses he took with well known economists, including Oskar Morgenstern, William Baumol, and Richard E. Quandt. His dissertation, entitled “Patent Licensing and Royalty Terms”, explored proposed new theoretical foundations for patent-licensing policy and royalty provisions.

==Career==
Williamson&#x27;s first academic posting was at the University of York, where he taught microeconomics. At the time, there were four other professors on the economics department: Alan T. Peacock, Jack Wiseman, John Hutton, and Douglas Dosser. In his fourth year at York, Williamson became a visiting professor in the department of economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he worked alongside Joseph Stiglitz, Charles Kindleberger, Paul Samuelson, and Tony Atkinson.

In October 1968, Williamson was appointed an adviser to the H.M. Treasury. He was in charge of overseeing relations with the European Economic Community, particularly France. He developed new forecasts on how British export markets were predicted to expand following various policy recommendations. There was also a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Allen, that formed British views on international monetary reform. Exchange rates were the main focus of the Treasury, as the IMF&#x27;s Special Drawing Rights had recently been introduced.

While serving at the Treasury, Williamson was offered chairs in economics from the University of Manchester, University of Nottingham, and the University of Warwick. He ultimately accepted the latter because he was attracted to the theories and research at newer universities. There he became Honorary Professor and taught courses in international economics and macroeconomics. While at Warwick, Williamson took a leave of absence to serve as an adviser to the International Monetary Fund. He replaced Fred Hirsch as senior adviser. After two years, he returned to Warwick where he published &quot;The Failure of World Monetary Reform, 1971–74&quot; (1977). In this capacity, he gained an international reputation for his contributions to the field. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) offered him a post to begin its graduate program in economics. He offered insights into the reasons for Brazil&#x27;s inflationary environment, beginning the country&#x27;s path to successful stabilization in 1922.

After serving as visiting professor of economics at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Williamson joined the-then Institute for International Economics as a Senior Fellow in 1981. There, he further developed research on international monetary cooperation. He also published a textbook, &quot;The Exchange-Rate System; The Open Economy and the World Economy&quot; (1983). He joined the first cohort of scholars at the institute, working alongside William Cline and Gary Hufbauer.

==Research==
Williamson is the author or editor of over 40 books on international monetary and developing-world debt issues. He has authored/co-authored 56 journal articles, and has been cited around 2,000 times according to Google Scholar. He is ranked by &quot;IDEAS&quot; RePEc publications monitor in 2019 as among the 2,000 most influential economists of the world of all time.

===Exchange rates===
Much of Williamson&#x27;s early career focused on developing a theory of the crawling peg. He has since stated that his primary contribution to the discipline has been his research on exchange rates. The system entailed gradual devaluations of the currency, changing expectations that the currency will devalue and interest rates would be sufficiently high to compensate bondholders. His proposal contrasted with the existing adjustable peg, in which the rate is pegged in the short run. His theories on the crawling peg were well received among economists. Sir Roy Harrod of Christ Church, Oxford University offered him a prestigious post, which Williamson declined. During the early 1970s, Williamson was involved in working with the Committee of Twenty for devising the IMF&#x27;s strategy to comprehensive systemic reforms. He has continued to modify his theories of intermediate exchange rates with new proposals on monitoring bands and reference rates.

During the 1980s, while working at the Institute for International Economics, Williamson began exploring theories on target zones. He argued that these targets should be based on estimates of the real exchange rate, which would accommodate secular trends in productivity growth, real shocks to the economy, and new information. The main mechanism of adjustment was monetary policy, supported by direct exchange-rate intervention. He worked with Fred Bergsten, then the institute&#x27;s Director, on ways of helping Latin American countries stabilize their currencies through this process. He argued that intermediate exchange-rate regimes maintain competitiveness in increasingly globalized economies, while also being politically favorable. Beginning in 1985, Williamson worked with Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Richard Darman to develop a comprehensive system of optimal exchange rates (&quot;target zones&quot;). At the 1987 Louvre Accord, the G-5 industrialized nations adopted a system of reference exchange rates that was influenced by proposals of C. Fred Bergsten and John Williamson for a target zone system. Research has shown that Williamson was largely correct in his assessment of altering expectations through his proposal of post-Louvre target zones. Shortly thereafter, however, the target zones were replaced due to the belief that free-floating exchange rates would have been preferred. Williamson challenged this notion through his theories on intermediate exchange rates.

For much of his academic career, he worked on a theory of &quot;intermediate&quot; exchange rates as an intermediate between fixed exchange rates and floating exchange rates. He was a critic of capital liberalization and the bipolar exchange rate. Rüdiger Dornbusch (MIT) summarized this proposal as a &quot;BBC&quot; (band, basket, and crawl). Williamson further coined the concept of “fundamental equilibrium exchange rate” (FEER) in &quot;Estimating Equilibrium Exchange Rates&quot; (1994) to describe how exchange-rate misalignments resulted in balance-of-payments crises. The IMF began using FEERs as the basis of its exchange-rate policies. There were also adoptions of FEERs in the private sector, most notably the Goldman Sachs desirable effective exchange rates (GSDEERs).

In the 1990s, Williamson continued his policy-oriented contributions. In 1996, Williamson became Chief Economist for South Asia, World Bank. He was invited by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to assess policy reform in Latin America. The project, headed by President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo, involved assessing options for expanding the roles of the World Trade Organization and the International Labour Organization. The findings of the report, the &quot;Report of the High-level Panel on Financing for Development&quot; (2001) were discussed at a subsequent conference. The panel found that to secure economic growth and equity, developing countries needed to achieve balanced budgets, ensure macroeconomic discipline, and support human capital investments. This Zedillo Report also recommended that the United Nations organize a series of climate-change conferences. In 2018, he stated that climate change was the number one concern facing economics. Following his retirement, Williamson wrote a book on growth-linked securities. It argues that, instead of fixed interest rates, certain securities should bear an interest rate that positively correlated with the growth of a country. Such an instrument would allow investors to have a vested interest in the economic growth.

===Washington Consensus===

In 1989, he coined the term &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; to describe policy reforms that the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury advocated for emerging-market economies. The term arose from a publication, “What Washington Means by Policy Reform” (1990) that described what countries should do according to the convictions of Washington-based institutions. It became more widely known after a conference at the Institute for International Economics. Many of those who attended, including Allan Meltzer, Richard Feinberg, and Stanley Fischer, were receptive to the idea. The proposal notably received pushback from Rudi Dornbusch, who proclaimed &quot;Williamson surrendered to Washington.&quot;

The term gained popularity and continues to be used today, both as Williamson described and in its current-day form. Critics of the Washington Consensus argue that it endorses complete free movements of capital. However, Williamson&#x27;s 1989 conceptualization of the consensus only included foreign direct investment. He connected these policy recommendations to his advocacy of target zones and limited exchange-rate fluctuations. The list of ten policies involved broad policy recommendations for economic stabilization: liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI), legal security for property rights, and trade liberalization, among others.

Since the term entered public discourse, it has been misinterpreted and distorted from its original meaning. Williamson claimed that the guidelines were meant to establish economic stability through stable institutions and cooperation. His policies had also been connected to the neoliberal policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, whom he disliked. Instead, Williamson argued that these were a series of recommendations—not requirements—for Latin American countries. Some politicians, notably the former finance minister of Brazil Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, recognized that the term had been used outside of the original context. He also felt that advocacy for economic stabilization through his policies were not necessarily neoliberal. He later included an updated set of policy proposals to the Washington Consensus in “What Should the World Bank Think about the Washington Consensus?” (2000). Joseph Stiglitz, former Chief Economist of the World Bank and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, did not object to the Washington Consensus per se, but to the neoliberal policies that policymakers have adopted. He noted, at the time, that the policies were appropriate for some Latin American countries, but not for many others. More recently, economists have recognized that the term was misconstrued from its original meaning, notably with regard to the opening of the capital account. Williamson et al. argued for prudential capital controls for developing countries through international coordination efforts. As Narcís Serra, Shari Spiegel, and Joseph E. Stiglitz, noted &quot;the Washington Consensus has come to be associated with ‘market fundamentalism,’ the view that markets solve most, if not all, economic problems by themselves—views from which Williamson has carefully distanced himself.&quot;

In 2012, scholars debated over a new term to describe China&#x27;s economic growth. Business executive Joshua Cooper Ramo coined the term Beijing Consensus to frame China&#x27;s economic development as an alternative to the Washington Consensus. The three guidelines he proposed were: 1. a commitment to innovation, 2. emphasis on sustainable growth through measures alongside GDP, and 3. a policy of self-determination. In turn, Williamson argued that the Beijing Consensus comprised five major points: 1. incremental reform, 2. innovation, 3. export-led growth, 4. state capitalism, and 5. authoritarianism. In light of this change, Williamson argued Western countries should modify their policies through export-led growth, prudential capital controls, and fiscal policies.

===Growth-linked securities===

In 2006, Williamson published an article describing the benefits of bonds linked to the growth of a country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). These refer to securities where the issuer (a government) promises to pay the investor returns based on the changes to that country&#x27;s GDP. In other words, the investor obtains a stake in a country&#x27;s growth through this &quot;equity-like&quot; feature. Williamson argued that these bonds would help countries obtain stability from capital flight. The idea was also developed by other distinguished economists, including Nobel Prize Laureates Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz. Williamson built on the research conducted by Shiller to discuss how, in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007–9 and the European debt crisis of 2010, economic stability has become all the more important.

==Personal life==
Williamson married Denise Rosemary Rausch (b. 1940), a scholar at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). He has three children: André Williamson (b. 1968), Daniel (b. 1969), and Theresa (b. 1975).

In 2012, Williamson retired from the PIIE. His Festschrift, &quot;Global Economics in Extraordinary Times: Essays in Honor of John Williamson&quot; (2012), was edited by C. Fred Bergsten, former assistant to Henry Kissinger on the U.S. National Security Council and assistant secretary for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Williamson resided in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He was fluent in Portuguese.

Williamson died from multiple system atrophy at his home in Chevy Chase on April 11, 2021, at age 83.

<text>Disestablishmentarianism is a movement to end the Church of England&#x27;s status as an official church of England

==Anglican disestablishment==
===Irish church===
The campaign to disestablish the Anglican Church of Ireland began in the 18th century. A rich church, with 22 bishops drawing £150,000 a year in aggregate, and a further £600,000 going annually to the rest of the clergy, it was wholly disproportionate to the needs of its worshippers, and consisted largely of absentee sinecurists. Given that in Ireland not even nominal adherence by the predominantly Roman Catholic majority population could be expected for the (Protestant) established Church, defence of the latter became increasingly difficult, especially after Catholic emancipation. In 1833 a Church Reform Act was passed, reducing the number of sees from 22 to 12, but attempts to redistribute the church&#x27;s wealth failed amidst political controversy.

Eventually, as G. M. Trevelyan put it, &quot;the disestablishment and partial disendowment of the Irish Protestant Church was carried out in a masterly and sympathetic manner by William Ewart Gladstone, whose known position as an enthusiastic Churchman stood him in good stead during the negotiations&quot;; and in 1869 an Act of the British Parliament enabling the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland was passed, coming into effect on 1 January 1871.

===English developments===
The early 19th century saw Radicals like Jeremy Bentham formulating schemes for the disestablishment of the church, which received new impetus after the success of Catholic emancipation. Following the Great Reform Act, they were increasingly joined by dissenters and nonconformists in a Liberal campaign to disestablish the Church of England – dissenting ministers like T. Binney proclaiming that &quot;the Established Church is a great national evil&quot;.

The campaigners were called &quot;Liberationists&quot; (the &quot;Liberation Society&quot; was founded by Edward Miall in 1844); and gathered strength to the point where, mid-century, Anglicans and Dissenters alike would have been astonished to learn that the church would remain established over a century later. There were, however, several reasons this campaign failed: parliamentary reform of the church to make it more efficient; Whig acquiescence in a system whereby they could appoint latitudinarian bishops with liberal views; and a dissenter focus instead on a process by which nearly all of the legal disabilities of nonconformists were gradually dismantled.

The campaign for disestablishment was revived in the 20th century from &quot;inside&quot; the church, when Parliament rejected the 1929 revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, leading to calls for separation of church and state to prevent political interference in matters of worship. In the late 20th century, reform of the House of Lords also brought into question the position of the Lords Spiritual. Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Liberal Democrats, said in April 2014 that he thought the Church of England and the British state should be separated &quot;in the long run&quot;. Prime Minister David Cameron, responding to Clegg&#x27;s comments, said that disestablishmentarianism is &quot;a long-term Liberal idea, but it is not a Conservative one&quot; and that he believed having an established church works well.

===Welsh conflicts=== 
The triumph of Methodism in Wales led by the 19th century to a situation where the vast majority of Protestants were &quot;not&quot; members of the Church of England, which in turn fuelled a long and bitter struggle for disestablishment, only resolved in the wake of the Welsh Church Act 1914 when in 1920 the Church of England was disestablished in Wales, becoming the Church in Wales.

==Presbyterian disestablishment==
Pressure to disestablish the Presbyterian Church of Scotland began in 1832, with dissidents like Thomas Chalmers arguing that a state church tended &quot;to secularize religion, promote hypocrisy, perpetuate error, produce infidelity, [and] destroy the unity and purity of the Church&quot;. However, focus swiftly shifted to the question of lay patronage &quot;within&quot; the church, not its separation from the state; and it was only well after the dissident split that created the Free Church of Scotland, on the grounds that &quot;they quitted a vitiated Establishment&quot;, that the Free Church joined William Ewart Gladstone in calling for the disestablishment of the Church of Scotland itself.

The twentieth century saw Presbyterian differences gradually diminished, and in 1929 the Free Church joined the Church of Scotland, to form the largest church in Scotland, in what can be considered a form of disestablishment.

==Literary echoes==
In Anthony Trollope&#x27;s 1858 novel &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot;, the local parson is laughingly described as well-to-do: &quot;He&#x27;s got what will buy him bread and cheese when the Rads shut up the Church – unless, indeed, they shut up the Funds too&quot;. Disestablishment also features in Trollope&#x27;s 1873 novel, &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;, in which a conservative leader adopts the policy, shocking his party, to outmaneuver the Liberals. Trollope undoubtedly had in mind (see chapter viii of &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;) Disraeli&#x27;s maneuver of adopting male household suffrage as Conservative party policy, leading to the Second Reform Act of 1867.

<doc id="541592" wikidata="Q4971815" url="?curid=541592" title="Broad-spectrum antibiotic">
<text>A broad-[[antimicrobial spectrum|spectrum]] antibiotic is an antibiotic that acts on the two major bacterial groups, Gram-positive and Gram-negative, or any antibiotic that acts against a wide range of disease-causing bacteria. These medications are used when a bacterial infection is suspected but the group of bacteria is unknown (also called empiric therapy) or when infection with multiple groups of bacteria is suspected. This is in contrast to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, which is effective against only a specific group of bacteria. Although powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotics pose specific risks, particularly the disruption of native, normal bacteria and the development of antimicrobial resistance. An example of a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic is ampicillin.

== Bacterial targets ==
Antibiotics are often grouped by their ability to act on different bacterial groups. Although bacteria are biologically classified using taxonomy, disease-causing bacteria have historically been classified by their microscopic appearance and chemical function. The morphology of the organism may be classified as cocci, diplococci, bacilli (also known as &quot;rods&quot;), spiral-shaped or pleomorphic. Additional classification occurs through the organism&#x27;s ability to take up the Gram stain and counter-stain; bacteria that take up the crystal violet dye stain are referred to as &quot;gram-positive,&quot; those that take up the counterstain only are &quot;gram-negative,&quot; and those that remain unstained are referred to as &quot;atypical.&quot; Further classification includes their requirement for oxygen (i.e., aerobic or anaerobic), patterns of hemolysis, or other chemical properties. The most commonly encountered groupings of bacteria include gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, atypical bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria.

== Empiric antibiotic therapy ==
Empiric antibiotic therapy refers to the use of antibiotics to treat a suspected bacterial infection despite lack of a specific bacterial diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of the species of bacteria often occurs through culture of blood, sputum, or urine, and can be delayed by 24 to 72 hours. Antibiotics are generally given &quot;after&quot; the culture specimen has been taken from the patient in order to preserve the bacteria in the specimen and ensure accurate diagnosis. Alternatively, some species may be identified through a urine or stool test.

== Risks ==

=== Disruption of normal microbiome ===

There are an estimated 38 trillion microorganisms that colonize the human body. As a side-effect of therapy, antibiotics can change the body&#x27;s normal microbial content by attacking indiscriminately both the pathological and naturally occurring, beneficial or harmless bacteria found in the intestines, lungs and bladder. The destruction of the body&#x27;s normal bacterial flora is thought to disrupt immunity, nutrition, and lead to a relative overgrowth in some bacteria or fungi. An overgrowth of drug-resistant microorganisms can lead to a secondary infection such as &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; (&quot;C. diff&quot;) or candidiasis (&quot;thrush&quot;). This side-effect is more likely with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, given their greater potential to disrupt a larger variety of normal human flora. The use of doxycycline in acne vulgaris has been associated with increased risk of Crohn&#x27;s disease, although a later study indicated a link between acne vulgaris and IBS irrespective of the use of antibiotics. Likewise, the use of minocycline in acne vulgaris has been associated with skin and gut dysbiosis.

== Examples of broad-spectrum antibiotics ==
In humans:
* Doxycycline
* Minocycline
* Aminoglycosides (except for streptomycin)
* Ampicillin
* Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin)
* Azithromycin
* Carbapenems (e.g. imipenem)
* Piperacillin/tazobactam
* Quinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin)
* Tetracycline-class drugs (except sarecycline)
* Chloramphenicol
* Ticarcillin

* Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)
* Ofloxacin
In veterinary medicine, co-amoxiclav, (in small animals); penicillin &amp; streptomycin and oxytetracycline (in farm animals); penicillin and potentiated sulfonamides (in horses).

<text>Kingsville is a town in Essex County in southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is Canada&#x27;s southernmost municipality with town status. The town had a population of 22,119 in the Canada 2021 Census a 2.6% increase from the previous census figure of 21,552 in the Canada 2016 Census. 

==History==
Kingsville was incorporated as a town in 1901. On 1 January 1999, the Town was amalgamated with the adjoining Township of Gosfield North and Township of Gosfield South to form an expanded municipality.

==Geography==
Kingsville is west of the Municipality of Leamington, south of the Town of Lakeshore and southeast of the Town of Essex and north of Lake Erie.

The geography of Kingsville is typical of most of Essex County. The terrain is generally flat, and consists of glacial drift which is a mixture of various rocks, sand and clay. The town is approximately 570 feet above sea level.

===Communities===
In addition to the primary settlement at Kingsville, the municipality also includes the smaller communities of Cedar Beach, Cedar Island, Cedarhurst Park, Cottam, Klondyke, Linden Beach, North Ridge, Olinda, Ruthven and Union. The community of Albuna is located on the boundary between Kingsville and Leamington, and the communities of Arner and Elford are located on the boundary between Kingsville and Essex.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kingsville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Attractions==
Kingsville is home to the Jack Miner Bird Sanctuary. Jack Miner was awarded The Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his achievements in conservation in the British Empire. It was awarded June 23, 1943, by King George VI, as King of Canada. Jack Miner is considered &quot;the father of the conservation movement on the continent&quot;.

Kingsville is home to Colasanti&#x27;s Tropical Gardens which attracts people from all over Ontario. The gardens have many varieties of tropical plants and animals. Kingsville is also home to the Kingsville Music Festival which is organized by the Kingsville Music Society. It began in early August 2014 and has continued each year with headliners such as Bruce Cockburn, Ashley MacIsaac, Steven Page, and Kathleen Edwards.

Kingsville was, for over a decade, home to the Williams family&#x27;s Christmas light show which had over the years grown to a display with more than 60,000 lights. Over the years, this show was used by the family to raise money to help with the fight against cancer, and thus far have raised over $40,000. In 2024 the city enacted a bylaw that would have required the family to apply for a permit for their display that would also limit their hours of operation. Rather than comply with these new regulations, they have decided instead to discontinue this display in the town and have been looking for other municipalities to host this display instead.

==Sports==
Kingsville was, for 26 years, the home town of the Great Lakes Jr. C team Kingsville Comets. The team was sold and moved to Amherstburg in 2013, becoming the Amherstburg Admirals. The town was among the top 5 places in Canada chosen for CBC&#x27;s Kraft Hockeyville 2008, and finished in 2nd place in the competition with over 1.5 million votes.

In 2015, the Kingsville Kings were formed and added to the South Conference of the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League. They play out of the Kingsville Arena Complex.

After playing a neutral site game in Kingsville during the 2016–17 season, the St. Clair Shores Fighting Saints of the Federal Hockey League relocated to Kingsville for the 2017–18 season as the North Shore Knights. The team played most of its home games out of the Kingsville Arena Complex with a few other neutral site home games in various cities in Ontario and Quebec. After cancelling several games during the season, the Knights were not listed as an FHL member the following season.

==Education==
Kingsville has two schools, St. John de Brebeuf Catholic Elementary School and Erie Migration District School. Erie Migration District School opened in September 2024 and amalgamated the student body of three previous schools Kingsville Public School, Jack Miner Public School and Kingsville District High School; all of which were closed as of June 2024. Several community members were critical of the name chosen for the new school. 

A fourth school, Ruthven Public School, was closed in the summer of 2013 due to overall declining enrollment. Students from Ruthven were assigned to Jack Miner Public School.

<doc id="541602" wikidata="Q411646" url="?curid=541602" title="Oxytetracycline">
<text>Oxytetracycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, the second of the group to be discovered.

Oxytetracycline works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to produce essential proteins. Without these proteins, the bacteria cannot grow, multiply and increase in numbers. Oxytetracycline therefore stops the spread of the infection, and the remaining bacteria are killed by the immune system or eventually die.

Oxytetracycline is active against a wide variety of bacteria. However, some strains of bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic, which has reduced its effectiveness for treating some types of infections.

Oxytetracycline is used to treat infections caused by &quot;Chlamydia&quot;, such as psittacosis, trachoma, and urethritis, and infections caused by &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; organisms, such as pneumonia.

Oxytetracycline is used to treat acne, due to its activity against the bacteria on the skin that influence the development of acne (&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;). It is used to treat flare-ups of chronic bronchitis, due to its activity against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Oxytetracycline may be used to treat other rarer infections, such as those caused by a group of microorganisms called rickettsiae (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever). To make sure the bacteria causing an infection are susceptible to it, a tissue sample is usually taken; for example, a swab from the infected area or a urine or blood sample.

Oxytetracycline was patented in 1949 and came into commercial use in 1950. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines as an alternative to tetracycline.

==Medical uses==
Oxytetracycline, like other tetracyclines, is used to treat many infections, both common and rare. Its better absorption profile makes it preferable to tetracycline for moderately severe acne at a dosage of 250–500 mg four times a day for usually six to eight weeks at a time, but alternatives should be sought if no improvement occurs by three months.

It is sometimes used to treat spirochaetal infections, clostridial wound infection, and anthrax in patients sensitive to penicillin. Oxytetracycline is used to treat infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts, skin, ear, eye and gonorrhoea, although its use for such purposes has declined in recent years due to large increases in bacterial resistance to this class of drugs. The drug is particularly useful when penicillins and/or macrolides cannot be used due to allergy. It may be used to treat Legionnaire&#x27;s disease as a substitute for a macrolide or quinolone.

Oxytetracycline is especially valuable in treating nonspecific urethritis, Lyme disease, brucellosis, cholera, typhus, tularaemia, and infections caused by &quot;Chlamydia, Mycoplasma&quot;, and &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. Doxycycline is now preferred to oxytetracycline for many of these indications because it has improved pharmacologic features.

The standard dose is 250 to 500 mg every six hours by mouth. In particularly severe infections, this dose may be increased accordingly. Occasionally, oxytetracycline is given by intramuscular injection or topically in the form of creams, ophthalmic ointments, or eye drops.

== Side effects ==
Side effects are mainly gastrointestinal and photosensitive allergic reactions common to the tetracycline antibiotics group. It can damage calcium-rich organs, such as teeth and bones, although this is very rare. It sometimes causes nasal cavities to erode; because of this, tetracyclines should not be used to treat pregnant or lactating women and children under age twelve except in certain conditions where it has been approved by a specialist because there are no obvious substitutes. Candidiasis (thrush) is not uncommon following treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

== History ==
It was first found near Pfizer laboratories in a soil sample yielding the actinomycete &quot;Streptomyces rimosus&quot; by Finlay et al. In 1950, a group at Pfizer led by Francis A. Hochstein, working in a loose collaboration with the Harvard organic chemist Robert B. Woodward, worked out the chemical structure of oxytetracycline, enabling Pfizer to mass-produce the drug under the trade name Terramycin. This discovery was a major advancement in tetracycline research and paved the way for the discovery of an oxytetracycline derivative, doxycycline, which is one of the most popularly used antibiotics today.

== Biosynthesis ==
Oxytetracycline belongs to a structurally diverse class of aromatic polyketide antibiotics, also known as bacterial aromatic polyketides, produced by &quot;Streptomyces&quot; via type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). Other compounds produced via type II PKSs are important bioactive compounds ranging from anticancer agents like doxorubicin to antibiotics such as tetracycline. The biosynthesis of oxytetracycline can be broken down into three general portions: first is the formation of an amidated polyketide backbone with minimal polyketide synthases (PKSs), second is the cyclization of the polyketide backbone, and finally, the formation of anhydrotetracycline—a shared intermediate with tetracycline—to produce oxytetracycline.

The biosynthesis of oxytetracycline begins with the utilization of PKS enzymes ketosynthase (KS), the chain length factor (CLF), the acyl carrier protein (ACP), and an acyltransferase (encoded as &quot;OxyA&quot;, &quot;OxyB&quot;, &quot;OxyC&quot; and &quot;OxyP&quot; in the oxytetracycline gene cluster) to catalyze the extension of the malonamyl-CoA starting unit with eight malonyl-CoA extender units. The process of elongating the polypeptide skeleton occurs through a series of Claisen-like decarboxylation reactions until the linear tetracyclic skeleton is formed. Thus, minimal PKSs form a completed amidated polyketide backbone without any additional post-synthase tailoring enzymes (Figure 1).

Following the formation of the linear tetracyclic skeleton, four successive cyclization reactions must occur in a regioselective manner to produce the aromatic natural product known as pretetramid, a common precursor to both oxytetracycline and other tetracycline antibiotics. In the oxytetracycline gene cluster, these enzymes are encoded as &quot;OxyK&quot; (aromatase), &quot;OxyN&quot; (cyclase), and &quot;OxyI&quot; (cyclase). Formation of pretetramid allows for one of the most important intermediates en route to the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline; this is the generation of anhydrotetracycline. Anhydrotetracycline contains the first functionalized A ring in this biosynthetic pathway.

After the formation of anhydrotetracycline, ATC monooxygenase (&quot;OxyS&quot;) oxidizes the C-6 position in an enantioselective manner in the presence of the cofactor NADPH and atmospheric oxygen to produce 5a,11a-dehydrotetracycline. Next, a hydroxylation occurs at the C-5 position of 5a,11a-dehydrotetracycline via the oxygenase encoded as &quot;OxyE&quot; in the oxytetracycline gene cluster. This produces the intermediate 5a,11a-dehydro-oxytetracycline. However, the exact mechanism of this step remains unclear. The final step of this biosynthesis occurs through the reduction of a double bond in the α, β—unsaturated ketone of 5a,11a-dehydro-oxytetracycline. In this final step, the cofactor NADPH is employed by &quot;TchA&quot; (reductase) as the reducing agent. Upon reduction, the enol form is favored due to conjugation, thus producing the aromatic polyketide oxytetracycline. Figure 2 shows the biosynthesis as described above, as well as an arrow-pushing mechanism of NADPH being used as the final cofactor in the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline.

== Veterinary indications ==
Oxytetracycline is used to control the outbreak of American foulbrood and European foulbrood in honeybees.

Oxytetracycline can be used to correct breathing disorders in livestock. It is administered in a powder or through an intramuscular injection. American livestock producers apply oxytetracycline to livestock feed to prevent diseases and infections in cattle and poultry. The antibiotic is partially absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal and the remaining is deposited in manure. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service studied the breakdown of oxytetracycline in manure depending on various environmental conditions. They found the breakdown slowed with increased saturation of the manure and concluded this was a result of decreased oxygen levels. This research helps producers understand the effects of oxytetracycline in animal feed on the environment, bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.

Oxytetracycline is used to mark fish which are released and later recaptured. The oxytetracycline interferes with bone deposition, leaving a visible mark on growing bones.

Oxytetracycline has been formulated as a broad-spectrum anti-infective for fish under the name Terramycin 200 (TM200). It is used to control certain diseases that adversely affect salmonids, catfish, and lobsters.

<doc id="541622" wikidata="Q3777749" url="?curid=541622" title="Attorney General of Ireland">
<text>The attorney general of Ireland () is a constitutional officer who is the legal adviser to the Government and is therefore the chief law officer of the State. The attorney general is not a member of the Government but does participate in cabinet meetings when invited and attends government meetings. The current attorney general is Rossa Fanning, SC.

==Overview==
The office and functions of the attorney general are outlined in Article 30 of the Constitution of Ireland.

The attorney general has always been a barrister rather than a solicitor, although this is not a requirement for the post. In cases where a barrister nominated by the Taoiseach to be the attorney general was not a senior counsel at the time, the government of the day has made them one first, as occurred in the cases of John M. Kelly and John Rogers.

The attorney general advises the government on the constitutionality of bills and treaties, and presents the government&#x27;s case if the President refers any bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution before signing it.

The attorney general has few prosecution duties; these are limited to functions under the various Fisheries Acts and Extradition Acts. Instead, the Director of Public Prosecutions has responsibility for all other criminal prosecutions in the State.

The Office of the Attorney General is made up of different offices:
* The Attorney General&#x27;s Office (located at Government Buildings, Merrion Street, Dublin 2) containing the advisory counsel to the attorney general (providing legal advice)
* The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (also located at Merrion Street, Dublin 2) containing the Parliamentary Counsel who draft legislation and have responsibilities in the area of Statute Law revision
* The Chief State Solicitor&#x27;s Office (located at Little Ship Street, Dublin 8) containing the solicitors representing the Attorney and the State who provide litigation, conveyancing and other transactional services
* The Statute Law Revision Unit which simplifies and improves the body of statute law

Part of the attorney general&#x27;s function has been to support the Statute Law Revision Programme of the Law Reform Commission, which reviews all legislation passed before independence to investigate which laws are obsolete and may be repealed, and which should be kept. This includes laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Britain, England, and the Irish Parliament. For example, the killing of cattle in Dublin is still regulated, in part by an Irish act of 1743, the Slaughter of Cattle Act 1743 (17 Geo. 2. c. 5 (I)), while the &quot;Treatment of Foreign Merchants&quot; is governed by clause 30 of Magna Carta (25 Edw. 1), an act of the Parliament of England dated 1297.

==History==
The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 provided a legislative basis for the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State (). This act provided it with:
It also transferred the following bodies to the office of the Attorney-General:
*Chief Crown Solicitor for Ireland.
*Chief State Solicitor&#x27;s Department and all local State Solicitors.
*Treasury Solicitor for Ireland.
*Parliamentary Draftsman.
*Charities.
*Estates of illegitimate deceased persons.

The Constitution of Ireland, which came into operation on 29 December 1937, established the position of Attorney General of Ireland in Article 30, providing it with a constitutional basis for the first time. Article 59 provided that the attorney general of Saorstát Éireann before the coming into operation of the Constitution would become the attorney general on the coming into operation of the Constitution without the need for an appointment, which occurred on 29 December 1937.

Until 1974, the attorney general was responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences. In 1974, the position of Director of Public Prosecutions was established. Local state solicitors were transferred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2007.

==Other functions==
Two less well-known but significant roles played by all Irish Attorneys General to date are as the &quot;leader of the Irish Bar&quot; and as a Bencher of the King&#x27;s Inns. The acceptance by Attorneys General of these non-statutory and often secretive roles upon taking office throughout the years has been questioned and criticised as inappropriate for a constitutional office-holder. In 1990, the Fair Trade Commission stated that &quot;[w]e have recommended that the Bar Council should be the primary disciplinary body for barristers, and it does not include any members of the judiciary. The Attorney General is, however, a member of the Bar Council, and the Commission believes that it is preferable that he should not be involved when the Bar Council is exercising its disciplinary function. The Attorney General is also a member of the Council of King&#x27;s Inns, and the Commission believes it to preferable that he should not participate in any disciplinary activity pursued by that body either. Indeed, in general, we find the membership of these bodies by the Attorney General to be somewhat anomalous.&quot;

==Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government==
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government is the Office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government of Ireland. It is part of the office of the Attorney General. It drafts bills which the Government intends to introduce in the Oireachtas. Although the Oireachtas as the legislature has formal authority to enact legislation, in practice the government whip rarely allows substantive amendments to bills to be made in the Dáil or Seanad; thus the Parliamentary Counsel&#x27;s role is crucial.

<doc id="541624" wikidata="Q6016799" url="?curid=541624" title="Independent Manchester United Supporters Association">
<text>The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA) is an organisation linked to Manchester United football club, based in Manchester, England.

The group is independent of the club. Its primary aim is to represent the interests of the club&#x27;s supporters, and facilitate lines of communication between the supporters and the directors of the club. The organisation was formed at a meeting at the Gorse Hill Hotel in Stretford in April 1995 as a protest group against official club policies regarding standing during matches.

The group have been opposed to foreign ownership of the club, opposing both the unsuccessful takeover attempt by Rupert Murdoch, and the later successful takeover by the current owners, the Glazer family. The group has also opposed rising ticket prices which they believe make the club&#x27;s games inaccessible to the &quot;true&quot; owners, the supporters.

==Notable members==
* Roger Taylor, of the band Queen, donated £10,000.

<text>A cantus (Latin for &quot;singing&quot;, derived from &quot;cantare&quot;) is an activity organised by Belgian, Dutch, German, French, and Baltic fraternities. A cantus mainly involves singing traditional songs and drinking beer. It is governed by strict traditional rules. The use of this dates back a few centuries and was inspired by German student organisations; however, some of the songs that are sung date back to the Middle Ages. Cantus probably shares its roots with commercium, sitsit and tableround.

Currently, the world record for biggest traditional cantus is in the hands of the Eurekaweek, based in Rotterdam, who welcomed 4594 officially registered guests during their 2019 cantus and 6200 in 2023.

== Codex ==

The songs are compiled in what the students refer to as the codex, which contains the club anthems of most student organisations and hundreds of songs in various languages, such as Dutch, French, English, German, Latin and Afrikaans. They usually have easy and familiar melodies. Nearly all of the songs predate World War II and refer to either drinking, the student&#x27;s (love) life or the history and past of the home country, city or region. For this reason, some songs are typically sung more by students of one city or another, e.g. students from Ghent will not sing songs about Leuven and vice versa, or they will simply replace instances of one city with another. Also due to the old nature of the songs, some of them have in recent years been controversial because they are perceived to be sexist, right-wing or racist.

In Antwerp, Hasselt, Leuven and Aalst, the codex used is that published by the KVHV (Katholiek Vlaams Hoogstudentenverbond or Catholic Flemish Students Union). However, due to disagreements between KVHV and LOKO (umbrella organisation for student associations in Leuven), there was a new codex developed for Leuven in 2023, called &#x27;Leuvens Liedboek&#x27;. In Brussels, the Flemish codex is published jointly by Polytechnische Kring and Brussels Senioren Konvent. In Ghent they also used to use the KVHV codex but since 2012 the SC Ghent (Studentikoos Centrum Ghent) has started to publish a codex catering more specifically to the student societies in Ghent. And at the end of that same year the SC Ghent started publishing a codex for the societies in West Flanders, mainly Courtrai.

The French-speaking students from Brussels use the Carpe Diem published by the Guilde Polytechnique or Les Fleurs du Mâle published by the Union des Anciens Etudiants de l&#x27;ULB. Those who are from Catholics highschools and universities of Brussels and Wallonia mostly choose Le Bitu Magnifique published by the Academicus Sanctae Barbae Ordo.

The biggest Belgian codex is the Florex published by the Corporation Brabantia Bruxelliensis, both in French and Dutch, with more than 2300 pages divided into two parts.

== Structure of a cantus ==

The cantus is led by the senior. In most cases, the senior is the praeses (president) of the student organisation that organises the cantus. He or she is responsible for keeping order at the cantus and can punish people who disrupt it. These punishments usually involve the drinking of beer in unusual, humorous or sometimes degrading ways if the culprit has committed a grave offence. The rest of the attending people are called the &#x27;corona&#x27; (Latin for &#x27;circle&#x27;). The senior can be aided by the ab actis and the cantor (Latin for &#x27;singer&#x27;). Another group of people at a cantus with a special status are the so-called proseniores (singular: prosenior), former presidents of the student&#x27;s club.

A special group at the cantus are the so-called &#x27;schachten&#x27; (in Dutch) or &#x27;bleus&#x27; (in French). They often are freshmen or first-year students and have the lowest status at the cantus itself, but students can also decide to join the club later in their studies. Some clubs even include special rites for attaining the position of schacht, with the preceding status of fetus. The schachten are, among other things, responsible for the distribution of the beer. They are not part of the corona and are supervised by the schachtenmeester or schachtentemmer in less (Dutch for &#x27;tamer of freshmen&#x27;) (in French, they&#x27;re called &#x27;Président de baptême&#x27; or &#x27;maître des bleus&#x27;), who answers only to the authority of the senior.

People at a cantus use special formulae, usually in Latin. For example, after a song, a senior can order the corona to drink collectively. They can do this by either saying &#x27;prosit corona&#x27; (after which the corona responds with &#x27;prosit senior&#x27;) a few times, or by using the formula &#x27;ad exercissimum sanctissimi salamandris omnes commilitones qui adsunt, surgite&#x27;, to which the corona replies &#x27;surgimus&#x27; whilst rising (&#x27;onwards to the exercise of the most sacred salamander, all of you fellow students present, rise&#x27; and &#x27;we rise&#x27;). Then the senior has the choice of either ordering &#x27;ad libitum&#x27; (drink as you please, which should be &#x27;ad libidinem&#x27; in more accurate Latin) or the more famous and notorious &#x27;ad fundum&#x27; (literally: to the bottom, or drink until the glass is empty). The corona can also start such a drinking procedure if it collectively begins with &#x27;prosit senior&#x27;. This is usually a manner of teasing the senior or testing their ability to withstand huge amounts of alcohol.

Normally, people at a cantus are required to remain silent (although most seniors are fairly tolerant in this regard), and if they want to address the corona or the senior, they should ask the senior for permission first, by asking &#x27;senior, peto verbum&#x27; (senior, I request to speak, lat. &quot;I request a word&quot;). They can reply by &#x27;habeas&#x27; (lat. &quot;you have it&quot;) or &#x27;non habeas&#x27; (lat. &quot;you do not have it&quot;). Most of the time the request is granted. At a cantus, people wear hats and sashes that tell something about their status in student life (e.g. broad sashes for members of the presidium, small sashes around the right shoulder for commilitones and small sashes around the left shoulder for the schachten). Not all student clubs hold on to this tradition, however. In some towns the use of hats and/or sashes is identified with the extreme-right.

<doc id="541631" wikidata="Q290596" url="?curid=541631" title="Bob Lemon">
<text>Robert Granville Lemon (September 22, 1920 – January 11, 2000) was an American right-handed pitcher and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976.

Lemon was raised in California, where he played high school baseball and was the state player of the year in 1938. At the age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the Cleveland Indians organization, with whom he played for his entire professional career. Lemon was called up to Cleveland&#x27;s major league team as a utility player in 1941. He then joined the United States Navy during World War II and returned to the Indians in 1946. That season was the first Lemon would play at the pitcher position.

The Indians played in the 1948 World Series and were helped by Lemon&#x27;s two pitching wins as they won the club&#x27;s first championship since 1920. In the early 1950s, Cleveland had a starting pitching rotation which included Lemon, Bob Feller, Mike Garcia and Early Wynn. During the 1954 season, Lemon had a career-best 23–7 win–loss record and the Indians set a 154-game season AL-record win mark when they won 111 games before they won the American League (AL) pennant. He was an All-Star for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more pitching wins in a nine-year period from 1948 to 1956.

Lemon was a manager with the Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. He was named Manager of the Year with the White Sox and Yankees. In 1978, he was fired as manager of the White Sox. He was named Yankees manager one month later and he led the team to a 1978 World Series title and a 1981 American League Championship. Lemon became the first AL manager to win a World Series after assuming the managerial role in the middle of a season.

==Early life==
Bob Lemon was born in San Bernardino, California. Lemon&#x27;s father, Earl Lemon, ran an ice business. The family later moved to Long Beach, California, where Lemon attended Wilson Classical High School and played shortstop on the school&#x27;s baseball team. He was recognized as the state baseball player of the year by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section in 1938.

Later that same year, at the age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the farm system of the Cleveland Indians as a member of the Oswego Netherlands of the Canadian–American League and later that year, the Middle Atlantic League&#x27;s Springfield Indians. In 75 games with the Netherlands he recorded a .312 batting average. The following season he played 80 games with Springfield, and hit .293, and then joined the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association, where Lemon hit .309. He spent the next two seasons at the Class A level with the Eastern League&#x27;s Wilkes-Barre Barons as he hit .255 in 1940 and .301 in 1941. In his final stint in the minors, Lemon hit .268 with 21 home runs for the 1942 Baltimore Orioles of the International League.

==Major League career==

===Making it as a utility player===
Lemon&#x27;s major league debut came as a third baseman as a late season call-up on September 9, 1941. He appeared in five games and collected one hit in five plate appearances. He was joined by catcher and fellow rookie Jim Hegan. He repeated the same number of games in the 1942 season and failed to record a hit. Lemon served in the United States Navy during World War II and missed the next three seasons. Before leaving for tour duty in 1943, Lemon married Jane McGee.

Lemon was the Indians&#x27; center fielder for Opening Day in 1946. On April 30, Indians pitcher Bob Feller no-hit the New York Yankees; Feller later wrote that Lemon&#x27;s &quot;daring catch&quot; and &quot;throwing to and doubling a man off second base&quot; were key in &quot;saving my&quot; no-hitter. By season&#x27;s end, however, Lemon had entered more games as a pitcher than a utility player. Before that season, Lemon had pitched only one inning while with Oswego and another while with Wilkes-Barre. Birdie Tebbetts of the Detroit Tigers and Johnny Pesky of the Boston Red Sox had played against Lemon in Navy baseball games, and they spoke to Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau about switching Lemon from the outfield to the pitching mound.

Boudreau discussed the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, who had also played in the Navy with Lemon. &quot;I knew Lemon had a strong arm, and once I realized he was not going to hit with consistency as an outfielder, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher,&quot; Boudreau later wrote. Lemon resisted the idea at first, but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher. Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position. Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider, a key pitch in his repertoire. That same year, Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon &quot;some day will become the best pitcher in the American League&quot;. Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49 ERA. He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox. During the last two months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including two 11-inning outings.

===Full-time pitcher to World Series champion===
Before the 1948 season started, team president Bill Veeck doubled Lemon&#x27;s contract amount. In what would be his first full season as a pitcher, Lemon was the Indians&#x27; number-two pitcher in the starting rotation, behind Bob Feller. On June 30, 1948, Lemon pitched a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers in a 2–0 win, becoming the ninth Indians pitcher to record a no-hitter and earning his 11th win and fifth shutout of the season. He ended his breakout season with an AL-best 20 complete games. His ten shutouts on the season were the most in the majors. Lemon would go on to win the 1948 AL Pitcher of the Year Award. With three games remaining in the regular season, 20-game winner Lemon started the first game of their final series against Detroit. Lemon allowed three runs on seven hits and the Indians lost the game. Cleveland lost two games of the three-game series, forcing a one-game playoff with the Boston Red Sox. Speculation built up around which Indians pitcher Boudreau would send to the mound against the Red Sox on October 4; the choices were largely narrowed down to Lemon and Satchel Paige. Lemon was listed as Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;probable pitcher&quot; by United Press International in morning newspapers the day of the game, even though he would be working on two days of rest. Instead, Boudreau went with Gene Bearden, who would be pitching on one day of rest, and the choice was solidified when veteran second baseman Joe Gordon spoke up in support of Boudreau at a team meeting. The Indians won the game at Fenway Park by a score of 8–3 and prepared to face the Boston Braves in the World Series.

Boudreau started Feller in game one, which Cleveland lost. Lemon was the starter in the second game. Lemon faced Warren Spahn, and Cleveland won 4–1. Lemon was named the starter for game six in Boston with the Indians leading the series 3–2. He allowed three earned runs on eight hits and Cleveland had the lead when Lemon was replaced by Bearden. The Braves scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth inning but the Indians won the game, 4–3, to clinch the franchise&#x27;s first World Series title since 1920. Lemon was the only pitcher from either club to win two games in the Series. He finished the Series with a 1.65 ERA.

Lemon&#x27;s hitting skills began to get attention as well. By August 1949, Lemon was batting .295 with 11 extra-base hits and six home runs, prompting Yankees manager Casey Stengel to comment: &quot;Well, I see where the Indians have nine hitters in the lineup instead of eight.&quot; UPI sportswriter Milton Richman wrote, &quot;Lemon&#x27;s fine work at the plate has also conspired to tire him more. When the Indians get behind and Lemon is pitching, he rarely is yanked for a pinch hitter in the early innings. It&#x27;s a tough price he&#x27;s paying for batting fame.&quot; In 1950, Lemon led the major leagues in wins (23) for the first time and won his second AL Pitcher of the Year Award. He pitched a six-hit complete game over the Detroit Tigers in his last start of the season on September 29. When Lemon signed a new contract before the 1951 season, the Indians made him the highest paid pitcher in baseball. At the beginning of the 1951 season, UPI sportswriter Oscar Fraley pointed out that Lemon was one of only 12 active pitchers who had earned a winning record in four consecutive seasons. He finished the season with a 3.52 ERA, lower than the 1950 season mark of 3.84 when he led the majors with 23 wins, and a 17–14 record. The loss total was the most in the AL. He did not record his first shutout of the season until well into August, when he earned a three-hit win over the Chicago White Sox. In 1952, Lemon recorded the second-lowest ERA of his career, 2.50, and went 22–11. His 28 complete games were a career-high and led the AL. Along with teammates Early Wynn (23), and Mike Garcia (22), Lemon gave Cleveland&#x27;s starting rotation three 20-game winners.

On Opening Day of the 1953 season, Lemon pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago White Sox and earned a win. He finished the season with a 21–15 record, 3.36 ERA and led the AL in innings pitched for the fourth and final time of his career.

===Second World Series appearance===
In , he was 23–7 and won his third AL Pitcher of the Year Award as Cleveland won the pennant. The Indians set an AL record with 111 wins. (The record stood until major league seasons were lengthened to 162 games, and it has been surpassed twice since then.) Lemon was named Cleveland&#x27;s starter for game one of the 1954 World Series. After nine innings, the Indians and Giants were tied 2–2. Lemon stayed in the game to pitch the tenth and final inning, but he surrendered a three-run home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost, 5–2. Indians manager Al López went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two days rest. &quot;He hasn&#x27;t worked that close together all year because we had a good bunch of other pitchers, but a year ago, he and Wynn and Garcia pitched every third day for practically a month. Bob will be all right,&quot; Lopez said. Lemon and the Indians lost the game, 7–4, as the Giants swept the Series four games to none. In his two appearances, he went 0–2 with a 6.75 ERA, allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts.

Lemon began the 1955 season with a 5–0 record in April, but he was the only Cleveland starting pitcher with a winning record that month. His 18 wins tied for the most in the AL that year. He recorded five complete games through May 30 but none after that date. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg got Lemon to agree to his first reduction in contract salary since joining the organization. Lemon earned his 200th career win against the Baltimore Orioles on September 11, 1956, and he also hit a home run that day. He finished the season with a 20–14 record, the last of his seven career 20-win seasons, and led the AL in complete games (21). On August 13, 1957, it was announced that Lemon would not finish the season due to continued irritation to his elbow after bone chips were found earlier in the season. Lemon ended the season with a record of 6–11, his first losing record since 1946.

In 1958, Lemon was the oldest Indian on the roster at age 37. Lemon pitched innings over the span of two games before he was put on the Indians&#x27; disabled list and sent to the Triple-A San Diego Padres. There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the pitching staff of the Indians&#x27; top farm club. He appeared in 12 games with the Padres, going 2–5, with a 4.34 ERA, 22 walks, and 19 strikeouts. He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role, but he appeared in only nine games that season. He earned just one decision that year, a loss, which brought his career pitching record to 207–128. The club put him on waivers in July.

===Retirement===
At 38, Lemon went to Tucson in 1959 to attend Indians&#x27; spring training camp. He told manager Joe Gordon that he was willing to become a relief pitcher, but he retired as a player on March 5, stating, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t keep up with the young fellows anymore.&quot; He accepted a scouting role with the Indians.
Lemon retired in 1958 with 207 wins, all but ten of them occurring in a ten-year span. He recorded 274 hits in 1,183 at-bats (.232), had 147 RBI, and his 37 career home runs are second on the all-time career list for pitchers (behind Wes Ferrell&#x27;s 38). In 1951, Ted Williams wrote of Lemon: &quot;I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, sinking, fast-breaking. You could never really &quot;uhmmmph&quot; with Lemon.&quot; The Indians retired Lemon&#x27;s jersey number, 21, on June 20, 1998 (Mike Hargrove, the Indians Manager at the time who was wearing number 21 switched to number 30). Lemon was the sixth Indian to receive the honor.

On January 22, 1976, Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. It was the twelfth ballot on which he had appeared. He received 78.6% of the vote. On August 8, one day before his induction ceremony, Lemon said, &quot;It&#x27;s a great thrill. My mother is 83 but she is making the trip from California. She says she can die happy now that I&#x27;ve been elected to the Hall of Fame.&quot; Lemon&#x27;s dominant slider has been cited as a key reason for his election to the Hall of Fame.

==Post-playing career==

===Coaching===
In 1959, Lemon became a scout and minor league pitching instructor for Cleveland. He spent part of 1959 season, and part of 1960, as a coach with the MLB Indians. In 1961, he joined the Philadelphia Phillies coaching staff. The California Angels hired him as their pitching coach for 1967–1968. In 1976, Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees. The Yankees were owned by Cleveland-area native George Steinbrenner and they had been the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon&#x27;s pitching years. In recognition of his election to the Hall of Fame, Lemon was named honorary captain of the AL team for the All-Star Game.

===Managing===

Lemon&#x27;s first managerial role came in 1964 with the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders of the PCL, an affiliate of the California Angels. The team went 60–98. In 1965, the Angels switched their Triple-A affiliation to the Seattle Angels and Lemon moved with the team. He managed the team in 1965–1966 and won the 1966 championship. He was named the PCL&#x27;s Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; for the 1966 season. In 1969, Lemon returned to the PCL as manager of the Vancouver Mounties, affiliated with the expansion Seattle Pilots and Montreal Expos. Lemon said he used Indians manager Al López as a model for his managing style:

:&quot;Lopez always handled his players like I&#x27;d want to be handled. He treated men like men. He made them feel relaxed. That&#x27;s the only way to play this game...by being relaxed. You can&#x27;t be worried about the manager getting on you. All the time I was at Cleveland, I saw Lopez get mad only twice. He never showed anybody up. I don&#x27;t do it either.&quot;

Tommy John, who played under both Lopez and Lemon, noticed this similarity. &quot;Lemon was an outstanding manager who never got the credit he deserved,&quot; John wrote in 1991. &quot;He was like Al Lopez; he let you alone and treated you like an adult.&quot; His approach to the game was to simplify it, trying to make it easier for everyone involved. Lemon frequently called his players &quot;Meat.&quot;

====Kansas City Royals====
Lemon became pitching coach of the Kansas City Royals for the season. He got his first major league managing job when Kansas City fired manager Charlie Metro on June 7, 1970. By August, Lemon received a one-year contract extension with the club:
:&quot;I know many major league owners are against hiring a former pitcher as manager and I&#x27;ve always wondered why. Pitching is 75 per cent of the game. If it&#x27;s so important, why not have a former pitcher as manager? He can always have someone else run the other 25 per cent of the club.&quot;

In , Lemon guided the Royals to their first winning season since the franchise began as an expansion team in . Lemon finished second in the Associated Press AL Manager of the Year voting. Before the 1972 season, Lemon talked about the team&#x27;s chances, saying &quot;Five clubs could win it, including ourselves.&quot; However, the Royals finished 76–78. Royals owner Ewing Kauffman fired Lemon as manager, saying he wanted a younger manager and &quot;did not want to lose Jack McKeon&quot;, who was named as Lemon&#x27;s replacement (Lemon was 51 while McKeon was ten years younger). Royals outfielder Lou Piniella was one of several players who disagreed with Kauffman&#x27;s decision, saying, &quot;...Lemon deserved to manage the club next year.&quot;

Lemon returned to managing in the minor leagues. His third and final stint in the PCL was in 1974 with the Sacramento Solons, affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers. His last minor league managerial position was in 1975 with the Atlanta Braves’ International League affiliate, the Richmond Braves.

====Chicago White Sox====

Bill Veeck hired Lemon to succeed Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon took over a Chicago team that finished in last place in the AL West in 1976. &quot;Bob is the type of manager we need at this stage of the game&quot;, Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, &quot;I think we&#x27;ll surprise a few people.&quot; White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, &quot;He&#x27;d post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we&#x27;d find out who was playing and where. Lemon&#x27;s made it a serious operation.&quot; As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. &quot;The fans got behind us after about three weeks. They had a lot to do with our success&quot;, Lemon said after being winning the award.

Lemon was fired the following season on June 30, 1978, by Veeck after Chicago posted a 34–40 record in the first half of the 1978 season. He was replaced by former Indians&#x27; teammate Larry Doby. &quot;This change is not meant as any commentary on Lemon&#x27;s ability but rather was the result of unusual circumstances which seemed to make a change necessary&quot;, said Veeck.

====New York Yankees====
Yankees manager Billy Martin resigned on July 24, 1978, and team president Al Rosen called Lemon to offer him the vacant position. He was announced as the new manager the next day. At their 1978 Old Timers Day five days after the Martin–Lemon changeover, the Yankees divulged that Lemon would be moved in 1980 to general manager, and they said that Martin would then return as field manager. The announcement was made by public-address announcer Bob Sheppard after the Old Timers had been announced and it was accompanied by Martin&#x27;s dramatic entrance from the Yankee dugout. Martin received a long standing ovation from fans. Lemon responded to his new job—and to the newspaper strike that helped calm down the atmosphere in the Yankees clubhouse—by guiding the Yankees to the pennant. The Yankees, who trailed the Red Sox by 14 games at one point in July, pulled even with the Red Sox by defeating them in a four-game September series known as the &quot;Boston Massacre&quot;. The Yankees pulled ahead by games, but the Red Sox rallied to tie the Yanks by the final day of the season. A one-game playoff would determine the AL Eastern Division winner.

Ron Guidry was named the Yankees&#x27; starting pitcher for the October 2 playoff game at Fenway Park. Guidry was able to pitch &quot;because of Lemon&#x27;s good planning&quot;. The Yankees defeated Boston for the division title in the tie-breaker game, punctuated both by a dramatic three-run home run by Bucky Dent in the seventh inning, and an eighth-inning homer by Reggie Jackson that proved the game&#x27;s winning run. Lemon became the third manager in MLB history to replace another mid-season and win the pennant. Lemon&#x27;s Yankees then beat the Royals in the ALCS and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series title. With the Series win, Lemon became the first AL manager and third MLB manager to take over a team mid-season and win a World Series. This was the second World Series championship for Lemon, who had won his last one in 1948; the thirty year gap between World championships set a record for longest gap between championships for a person that was not broken until 2022. Before the World Series, one columnist wrote, &quot;...many observers feel that Lemon&#x27;s low-keyed approach with the Yankees&#x27; temperamental millionaires as compared to the combativeness of Martin served to mold a spirit of togetherness among the Yankees that did not even exist last year when they won it all.&quot; Lemon and his handling of the season was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an island of calm in a stormy summer&quot;. Changes Lemon made during the season included returning Thurman Munson to the team&#x27;s every day catcher (he had been playing in the outfield), putting Jackson in the clean-up spot in the batting order and becoming the regular right fielder, and pitching Ed Figueroa every fourth day (instead of fifth). In October, Lemon was named the Associated Press&#x27; AL Manager of the Year, the second time he received such an award.

Lemon&#x27;s 26-year-old son, Jerry, was killed in an automobile accident in the fall of 1978, 10 days after Lemon won the World Series. Tommy John thought this was distracting him from fully focusing on baseball as the 1979 season began. In early June, several of the players got rowdy on a plane flight to Texas, blaring loud music from their cassette players. Lemon did nothing to intervene, which John thought might have prompted his dismissal. With the Yankees at 34–31, Lemon was fired in June by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin, but he remained with the organization as he had a contract through the 1982 season. Speaking of Martin, Lemon said, &quot;He&#x27;s a very likeable guy, a free spirit. Where maybe I keep things inside, he lets them come out. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.&quot; The Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East (89–71). Lemon worked as a scout for the Yankees and received &quot;several offers&quot; from other teams to serve as manager. One offer came in 1979 from the Indians, but Lemon refused it as well as the others.

====Second stint with Yankees====
Steinbrenner named Lemon the team&#x27;s field manager a second time on September 6, 1981, the sixth Yankees&#x27; manager change since 1978 after firing Gene Michael, who also had served as general manager and had won the first half of the split season. The Yankees moved on to the postseason and dispatched the Milwaukee Brewers and the Billy Martin-led Oakland Athletics, and won the first two games of the 1981 World Series against the Dodgers, only to lose four straight and the Series. Lemon survived just a few weeks into the 1982 season (the Yankees were 6–8) before Steinbrenner dismissed him one last time, despite a promise from Steinbrenner he would manage the season &quot;no matter what&quot;. Lemon had considered resigning a week before because of Steinbrenner&#x27;s constant criticisms, but coach Mike Ferraro talked him out of it. Of the agreement between Lemon and Steinbrenner, Steinbrenner said, &quot;Lem and I talked. He said it was O.K. He said he didn&#x27;t take it as a promise anyway.&quot; Tommy John thought Lemon &quot;was relieved&quot; at Steinbrenner&#x27;s decision. Gene Michael succeeded Lemon as manager. All in all, Lemon had managed just over one full season of games (172) for the Yankees, winning 99 games for a .576 winning percentage.

==Death==
Lemon suffered a stroke in his later years. Lemon died in 2000 in Long Beach, California, where he had been a permanent resident since his career as a player. Former teammate Bob Feller said, &quot;Bob had a good curve, a good slider, and a vicious sinker pitch. He wasn&#x27;t overly fast, but he always stayed ahead of the hitters and he didn&#x27;t walk many batters, which is the key to success in the majors.&quot;

<text>Praeses (Latin  &quot;praesides&quot;) is a Latin word meaning &quot;placed before&quot; or &quot;at the head&quot;. In antiquity, notably under the Roman Dominate, it was used to refer to Roman governors; it continues to see some use for various modern positions.

== Roman governors ==
&quot;Praeses&quot; began to be used as a generic description for provincial governors—often through paraphrases, such as &quot;qui praeest&quot; (&quot;he who presides&quot;)—already since the early Principate, but came in general use under the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. The jurist Aemilius Macer, who wrote at the time of Caracalla (reigned 198–217), insists that the term was applied only to the governors who were also senators—thereby excluding the equestrian &quot;procuratores&quot;—but, while this may reflect earlier usage, it was certainly no longer the case by the time he wrote. In the usage of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the term appears originally to have been used as an honorific, affixed to the formal gubernatorial titles (&quot;legatus Augusti&quot; etc.), and even, occasionally, for legion commanders or fiscal &quot;procuratores&quot;. By the mid-3rd century, however, &quot;praeses&quot; had become an official term, including for equestrian officials. The form &quot;[procurator] vice praesidis&quot; had also come into common use for equestrian &quot;procuratores&quot; entrusted with the governance of provinces in the absence of, or in lieu of, the regular (senatorial) governor. This marks a decisive step in the assumption of full provincial governorships by equestrians, with the first equestrian &quot;praesides provinciae&quot; appearing in the 270s.

This evolution was formalized in the reforms of Diocletian (r. 284–305) and Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), when the term &quot;praeses&quot; came to designate a specific class of provincial governors, the lowest after the &quot;consulares&quot; and the &quot;correctores&quot;. In the East, however, they ranked between the two other classes, possibly because the few &quot;correctores&quot; there were instituted after the &quot;praesides&quot;. The term &quot;praeses&quot; remained in general use for provincial governors, and was still used in legal parlance to designate all classes of provincial governors collectively. In common usage, the &quot;praesides&quot; were often also designated by more generic titles such as &quot;iudex&quot; (&quot;judge&quot;), &quot;rector&quot; or &quot;moderator&quot;, and sometimes archaically as &quot;praetor&quot;. In Greek, the term was rendered as (&quot;hegemon&quot;).

Most of the provinces (&quot;diocese&quot;) created by Diocletian by splitting the larger older ones were entrusted to such &quot;praesides&quot;, and they form the most numerous group of governors in the late-4th century &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;:

;in thirty-one provinces in the Western Roman Empire
*four in the Diocese of Illyricum: Dalmatia, Pannonia Prima, Noricum Mediterraneum, Noricum Ripense
*seven in Italy: Alpes Cottiae, Rhaetia Prima and Secunda, Samnium, Valeria, Corsica et Sardinia.
*two in the Diocese of Africa: Mauretania Sitifensis, Tripolitana
*four in Diocese of the Spains (Iberia and opposite African coast): Tarraconensis, Carthaginensis, Insulae Baleares, Mauretania Tingitana
*eleven in the Diocese of the Gauls: Alpes Maritimae, Alpes Poenninae et Graiae, Maxima Sequanorum, Aquitanica Prima and Secunda, Novempopulania, Narbonensis Prima and Secunda, Lugdunensis Secunda, Tertia and Senonica
*three in the Diocese of Britain: Britannia Prima and Secunda, Flavia Caesariensis.

;in forty provinces in the Eastern Roman Empire
* five in the Diocese of Egypt: Libya Superior and Inferior, Thebais, Ægyptus, Arcadia.
* eight in the Diocese of the East: Palaestina Salutaris and Secunda, Phoenice Libanensis, Euphratensis, Syria Salutaris, Osrhoene, Mesopotamia, Cilicia Secunda
* seven in the Diocese of Asia: Pisidia, Lycaonia, Phrygia Pacatiana and Phrygia Salutaris, Lycia, Caria, Insulae.
* eight in the Diocese of Pontus: Honorias, Cappadocia Prima and Secunda, Helenopontus, Pontus Polemoniacus, Armenia Prima and Armenia Secunda, Galatia Salutaris.
* four in the Diocese of Thrace: Haemimontus, Rhodope, Moesia Secunda, Scythia
* four in the Diocese of Dacia: Dacia Ripensis, Moesia Prima, Praevalitana, Dardania
* four in the Diocese of Macedonia: Thessalia, Epirus Vetus and Epirus Nova, Macedonia Salutaris.

In the East, the staff (&quot;officium&quot;) of the &quot;praeses&quot; (attested for Thebais) comprised the same as that of a &quot;consularis&quot;, i.e. a &quot;princeps officii&quot;, &quot;cornicularius&quot;, &quot;commentariensis&quot;, &quot;adiutor&quot;, &quot;numerarius&quot;, &quot;ab actis&quot;, &quot;a libellis&quot;, &quot;subadiuva&quot;; finally unspecified &quot;exceptores&quot; and &quot;cohortalini&quot; (menial staff). In the West (attested for Dalmatia), the &quot;officium&quot; was again the same as with the &quot;consulares&quot; and &quot;correctores&quot;, comprising the &quot;princeps officii&quot;, &quot;cornicularius&quot;, two &quot;tabularii&quot;, &quot;commentariensis&quot;, &quot;adiutor&quot;, &quot;ab actis&quot;, &quot;subadiuva&quot;, and the usual &quot;exceptores&quot; and &quot;cohortalini&quot;.

The status of a &quot;praeses&quot; could also be awarded as a separate honour, &quot;ex praeside&quot;, attached to the rank of &quot;vir perfectissimus&quot;.

== German advisors ==
In German academia a doctoral advisor is called the . However, in the 18th century and before, the doctoral system was quite different. Instead of a as such, the candidate had a &quot;praeses&quot; to act as mentor and who would also head the oral &quot;viva voce&quot; exam. In the 18th century the &quot;praeses&quot; often chose the subject and compiled the theses and the candidate had only to defend. Sometimes there were several candidates at the same time defending the same thesis, in order to save time.

== Modern uses ==
The chair of a student society in the Netherlands or Belgium may be called a praeses; in Dutch the official spelling has changed to &quot;&quot;preses&quot; but most student societies still observe the Latin spelling. Various minor offices may be designated by a compound title, e.g. &quot;dooppraeses&quot; in charge of initiation and associated hazing.

In modern Italian the word &quot;preside&quot;&quot; is still used to indicate the head of primary or secondary school, generally equivalent to the American principal or the British headmaster positions.

In Norway, the office of archbishop has been abolished. Instead, the Lutheran Church of Norway has a Bishops Conference which is presided over by a &quot;praeses&quot;.

In Sweden, the chair of academic institutions and disputations, as well as the bishop of Cathedral chapters, is called &quot;preses&quot;. 
The church bodies Evangelical Church in the Rhineland and Evangelical Church of Westphalia, in which the title and function of bishop are unknown, are also chaired by a &quot;praeses&quot; ().
In other German church bodies the title usually refers to the president of the synod. 

Roman Catholic religious institutions, especially Franciscan ones, use the term to indicate the presiding officer of a collegial meeting of the order.

The official Scots title of the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament is &quot;Preses o the Scots Pairlament&quot;.

The Polish word &quot;prezes&quot;, derived from Latin &quot;praeses&quot; means &quot;chairman&quot;.

<doc id="541636" wikidata="Q4354991" url="?curid=541636" title="HMS Lion (C34)">
<text>HMS &quot;Lion&quot; was a light cruiser of the British Royal Navy, originally ordered in 1942 as one of the and laid down that same year as &quot;Defence&quot; by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Greenock in Scotland on 6 June 1942.

Work was stopped and not begun again until the mid-1950s for completion as an air-defence cruiser pending the introduction of guided missile-equipped s into the navy. She was commissioned in 1960. All three &quot;Tiger&quot;s were to be converted into helicopter carriers but &quot;Lion&quot; was placed into reserve in 1965 and served as a supply of spares for the other two until decommissioned in 1972 followed by selling for scrap in 1975.

==Design and construction==
Partially complete, the ship was launched on 2 September 1944 by Lady Edelson, but work was suspended in 1946. The cruiser was further advanced than the two other &quot;Tiger&quot;s and its completion as HMS &quot;Defence&quot; in 1947 was anticipated. New Mk 24 triple six-inch turrets for four &quot;Tiger&quot;-class ships were 75-80% complete. but the decision was made in 1954 to fit the more advanced fully automatic Mk 26 twin 6-inch turrets. &quot;Lion&quot; was fitted with one hydraulic and one electric powered turret in A and Y positions, The three Mk 24 turrets in A, B and Y would have given more reliable all angle surface cover against multiple targets Still named &quot;Defence&quot;, she was laid up at Gareloch in Scotland for eight years in dehumidified sealed state in the RN Reserve Fleet, while the other incomplete &quot;Tiger&quot;s remained with their builders. By 1954 the condition of &quot;Defence&quot; &quot;was not so good&quot;, but it was felt &quot;Defence&quot;, &quot;Blake&quot;, and &quot;Tiger&quot; could still be completed, with new armament in three years at a cost of 6 million pounds while construction of equivalent new cruisers would cost 12 million pounds and take 5 years. Construction of &quot;Defence&quot; and two other cruisers was resumed to a revised design. &quot;Defence&quot; was renamed &quot;Lion&quot; in 1957 and construction continued at the Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson yards at Wallsend on the Tyne. Its final cost was 13 million pounds.

==Service history==
She was finally commissioned in July 1960, having been rushed into service with some shortcuts in the engineering department, due to political pressure to get her to sea. Initial trials were disrupted by severe rotor, turbine and vibration problems and a further three months in Portsmouth dockyard were required before she became fully operational in February 1961.

&quot;Lion&quot;″s first commission included a Mediterranean leg covering some 20,500 miles in 1961. In the latter part of that year she headed to South America and returned to Plymouth in 1962.

&quot;Lion&quot; recommissioned at Devonport for service in the Home Fleet and Far East on 31 July 1962 and sailed to the Mediterranean for work-up at the end of November. She reached the Far East in March 1963 and was present at the Malaya independence celebrations in September. She subsequently visited Australia before returning to the UK via the Suez Canal. In early 1964, &quot;Lion&quot; took part in major NATO and other national exercises; she then visited Spain and Portugal before returning to the UK.

In September 1964 &quot;Lion&quot; was present at the Maltese independence celebrations. Earlier that year she had been rammed under the Forth Road Bridge by the frigate . Emergency repairs were carried out in Rosyth dockyard before she sailed for Malta with only hours to spare. Early in 1965, &quot;Lion&quot; was present at the Gambian independence ceremony on Bathurst, now Banjul. Later that year, she was flagship of a small force for an official visit to Sweden. The ship was present at Portsmouth Navy Days in August 1965, before being decommissioned into the reserve at Devonport until 1972, when she was placed on the disposal list.

Plans to convert &quot;Lion&quot; along the lines of her sisters and were rejected as too costly. On 15 May 1973, she arrived at Rosyth and was subsequently stripped of parts and equipment for use in &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot;. &quot;Lion&quot; was sold for breaking up on 12 February 1975 for £262,500. On 24 April 1975 she arrived at Inverkeithing where she was scrapped by ship breakers Thos. W. Ward. Some equipment from her was salvaged and sold to Peru for use in their former British cruisers.

<text>Octopussy is a 1983 spy film and the thirteenth in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions. It is the sixth to star Roger Moore as the MI6 agent James Bond. It was directed by John Glen and the screenplay was written by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson.

The film&#x27;s title is taken from a short story in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1966 short story collection &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;, although the film&#x27;s plot is mostly original. It does, however, contain a scene adapted from the Fleming short story &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; (included in 1967 and later editions of &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;). The events of the &quot;Octopussy&quot; short story form part of the title character&#x27;s background.

In &quot;Octopussy&quot;, Bond is assigned the task of hunting a megalomaniacal Soviet general (Steven Berkoff) who is stealing jewellery and art objects from the Kremlin art repository. This leads Bond to the exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), and his associate Octopussy (Maud Adams), and the discovery of a plot to force disarmament in Western Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon.

&quot;Octopussy&quot; was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and executive produced by Michael G. Wilson; it was released four months before the non-Eon Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. The film earned $187.5 million against its $27.5 million budget and received mixed reviews. Praise was directed towards the action sequences and locations, with the plot and humour being targeted for criticism; Adams&#x27;s portrayal of the titular character also drew polarised responses.

==Plot==
After an encounter with knife-throwing twin assassins Mischka and Grishka in East Berlin, mortally wounded British agent 009, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg, crashes into the British ambassador&#x27;s residence and dies. MI6 suspects Soviet involvement and, after the real Fabergé egg is to be auctioned in London, sends James Bond to identify the seller.

At the auction, Bond switches the fake egg for the real one and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan to his palace in India. Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon using Khan&#x27;s loaded dice. Bond and his MI6 contact, Vijay, escape Khan&#x27;s bodyguard Gobinda in a taxi chase through a marketplace. Later, Khan&#x27;s associate Magda seduces Bond. Bond allows Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg, which is fitted with Q&#x27;s listening and tracking device. Gobinda knocks Bond unconscious and takes him to Khan&#x27;s palace. After Bond escapes, he listens in on the bug and discovers that Khan works with Orlov, a corrupt Soviet general seeking to defy his superiors and expand Soviet domination to Western Europe. Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures stolen from the Kremlin, replacing them with fakes while Khan has been smuggling the real objects into the West using Octopussy&#x27;s circus.

Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur and meets Octopussy, a businesswoman, smuggler and Khan&#x27;s associate. She also leads the Octopus cult, which Magda is a member of. Octopussy has a personal connection with Bond: her father was the late Major Dexter-Smythe, who Bond arrested for treason. Octopussy thanks Bond for allowing the Major to commit suicide rather than face trial, and invites Bond to be her guest. Khan&#x27;s assassins break into the palace to kill Bond, but Bond and Octopussy defeat them. Bond learns from Q that the assassins have killed Vijay.

Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt in East Germany, where the circus is scheduled to perform, while back in Moscow, General Gogol begins to pursue Orlov when the fake jewels are discovered. Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates the circus and discovers that Orlov has replaced the jewels with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus performance at a United States Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would cause Europe to seek unilateral disarmament in the belief that the bomb belonged to the US and was detonated at the airbase accidentally, which would leave the unprotected borders open to a Soviet invasion.

Bond drives Orlov&#x27;s car along the railway tracks and boards the circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed by border guards when he tries to catch the train as it crosses the border. Bond kills Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and after falling from the train, hitch-hikes a lift from a passing motorist to reach the airbase, eventually stealing a car from a nearby town to complete his journey. Bond penetrates the base and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He convinces Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her, and realizing that she has been tricked, she assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.

With the plan stopped, Khan has returned to his palace and prepares to flee. Bond and Octopussy also return separately to India. Bond arrives at Khan&#x27;s palace just as Octopussy and her troops launch an assault on the grounds.

Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy&#x27;s team overpowers Khan&#x27;s guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. As they attempt to escape in their plane, Bond clings to the fuselage and disables an engine and the elevator panel. Struggling with Bond, Gobinda falls to his death, and Bond and Octopussy jump off the plane onto a nearby cliff seconds before the plane crashes, killing Khan. While the Minister of Defence and Gogol discuss the return of the stolen jewels to the Kremlin, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private galley in India.

==Cast==

Other actors in smaller roles include Andy Bradford as MI6 agent 009, Dermot Crowley as Lieutenant Kamp, Orlov&#x27;s nuclear weapons expert; former Pan&#x27;s People dancer Cherry Gillespie as Midge, an Octopussy subordinate; Peter Porteous as Lenkin, the Kremlin art expert; Eva Rueber-Staier as Rublevitch, Gogol&#x27;s secretary; Jeremy Bulloch as Smithers, Q&#x27;s assistant; Richard LeParmentier as General Peterson&#x27;s aide; and Gabor Vernon as Borchoi. Ingrid Pitt has an uncredited voice cameo as Octopussy&#x27;s galley mistress.

==Production==
===Writing===
Despite financial problems at United Artists after the release of Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, the studio greenlit another James Bond film to be produced and released in 1983. In May 1981, one month after the announcement, UA was purchased and merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Michael G. Wilson, Richard Maibaum, and George MacDonald Fraser were hired to write a film based on short stories from Ian Fleming&#x27;s posthumous collection &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;. Little of the plot of the short story &quot;Octopussy&quot; is used, however, with its events simply related by Bond as the family backstory for one of the main characters. The scene at Sotheby&#x27;s is, though, adapted from the short story &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; (included in 1967 and later editions of the collection), while Kamal Khan&#x27;s reaction following the backgammon game is taken from Fleming&#x27;s novel &quot;Moonraker&quot;. After initially intending the film to be set in Japan, Fraser chose India as the setting because of his extensive research on the country for his novel &quot;Flashman&quot;.

Fraser was hired to work on an early draft of the script and he proposed that the story be set in India, as the series had not yet visited said country. The first draft was delivered shortly after the release of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, whose writers Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum went on to rework the script. They discarded his idea for the opening sequence, featuring a motorbike chase set at the Isle of Man TT, but still retained moments that producer Albert R. Broccoli had first criticized, where Bond dressed as a gorilla and later, a clown. The film was rewritten to focus on jewellery smuggling after a scandal in the Soviet Union involving General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s son-in-law in which the Moscow State Circus was being used to smuggle jewellery.

===Casting===

Following &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Roger Moore had expressed a desire to retire from the role of James Bond. His original contract had been for three films (&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; in 1973, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; in 1974 and &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; in 1977) which was fulfilled. Moore&#x27;s following two films (&quot;Moonraker&quot; in 1979 and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; in 1981) were negotiated on a film-by-film basis. Given his reluctance to return for &quot;Octopussy&quot;, the producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next Bond, with Timothy Dalton and Lewis Collins being suggested as a replacement and screen tests carried out with Michael Billington, Oliver Tobias, and American actor James Brolin. However, when rival Bond production &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was announced with former Bond Sean Connery playing Bond, the producers persuaded Moore to continue in the role as it was thought the established actor would fare better against Connery. It has been reported that Brolin had actually been hired and was on the point of moving to London to begin work on &quot;Octopussy&quot;, while Broccoli refused to dispute Tobias&#x27;s public statements that he was about to be cast as Bond.

Sybil Danning was announced in &quot;Prevue&quot; magazine in 1982 as being Octopussy, but was never actually cast, later explaining that Albert R. Broccoli felt &quot;her personality was too strong&quot;. Faye Dunaway was deemed too expensive. Barbara Carrera said she turned down the role in order to appear as Fatima Blush in the competing Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. &quot;Octopussy&quot; casting director Jane Jenkins revealed that the Bond producers told her that they wanted a South Asian actress to play Octopussy, so she considered the only two Indians in predominantly white Hollywood, Persis Khambatta and Susie Coelho. Afterward, she auditioned white actresses, like Barbara Parkins and Kathleen Turner, who she felt could pass for Indian. Finally, Broccoli announced to her that Octopussy would be portrayed by Swedish-born Maud Adams, who had been a Bond girl in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), and had been recently used by Eon to screen test the potential Bonds. To acknowledge the nationality, Adams had her hair darkened, and a few lines were added about how she was raised by an Indian family. A different plotline, with Adams&#x27;s British father exposed as a traitor, was used instead. The role of Magda went to another Swedish actress, Kristina Wayborn, who gained the attention of producers with her portrayal of Greta Garbo in the TV miniseries &quot;The Silent Lovers&quot;. Pam Grier turned down an offer to play a Bond girl in the film.

&quot;Octopussy&quot; is also the first film to feature Robert Brown as M, following the death of Bernard Lee in 1981. Brown was recommended by Moore, who had known him since both worked in the series &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. Brown had previously played Admiral Hargreaves in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, six years earlier.

The first actor to be cast in the film was Vijay Amritraj, a popular Indian professional tennis player whom Broccoli met while watching The Championships in Wimbledon. His character of Bond&#x27;s ally in India was also named Vijay and used a tennis racket as a weapon. For the villains, Broccoli brought in his friend Louis Jourdan as Kamal Khan, while his daughter Barbara suggested Steven Berkoff for Orlov after having seen him perform his own play, &quot;Greek&quot;, in Los Angeles.

===Filming===

The filming of &quot;Octopussy&quot; began in West Berlin on 10 August 1982 with the scene in which Bond arrives at Checkpoint Charlie. Other locations from the city included Spandau Prison, the Brandenburg Gate, and Potsdamer Platz. Principal photography was done by Arthur Wooster and his second unit, who later filmed the knife-throwing scenes. Filming in India began on 12 September 1982 in Udaipur, Rajasthan. The Monsoon Palace served as the exterior of Kamal Khan&#x27;s palace, while scenes set at Octopussy&#x27;s palace were filmed at the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir, and Bond&#x27;s hotel was the Shiv Niwas Palace. In England RAF Northolt, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Oakley were the main locations. The Karl-Marx-Stadt railways scenes were shot at the Nene Valley Railway in Peterborough, while studio work was performed at Pinewood Studios and the 007 Stage. Parts of the film were also shot in Hurricane Mesa, Hurricane-LaVerkin Bridge, and New Harmony in Utah. Most of the crew, as well as Roger Moore, had diet problems while shooting in India.
The pre-title sequence has a scene where Bond flies a nimble homebuilt Bede BD-5J aircraft through an open hangar. Hollywood stunt pilot and aerial co-ordinator J. W. &quot;Corkey&quot; Fornof, who piloted the aircraft at more than , has said, &quot;Today, few directors would consider such a stunt. They&#x27;d just whip it up in a computer lab.&quot; Having collapsible wings, the plane was shown hidden in a horse trailer; however, a dummy was used for this shot. Filming inside the hangar was achieved by attaching the aircraft to an old Jaguar car with a steel pole, driving with the roof removed. The second unit were able to add enough obstacles including people and objects inside the hangar to hide the car and the pole and make it look as though Moore was flying inside the base. For the explosion after the mini jet escapes, however, a miniature of the hangar was constructed and filmed up close. The exploding pieces of the hangar were in reality only long.

Much later in the film, Bond steals Orlov&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz at a depot defended by antagonist soldiers; as he tries to escape, he drives over barrier spikes shredding the tyres and then manoeuvres the car&#x27;s bare wheels onto the rails to pursue Octopussy&#x27;s circus train. During filming, the car had intact tyres in one scene so as to avoid any mishap.
Stunt coordinator Martin Grace suffered an injury while shooting the scene where Bond climbs down the train to catch Octopussy&#x27;s attention. During the second day of filming, Grace – who was Roger Moore&#x27;s stunt double for the scene – carried on doing the scene longer than he should have, due to a miscommunication with the second unit director, and the train entered a section of the track which the team had not properly surveyed. Shortly afterwards, a concrete pole fractured Grace&#x27;s left leg. The cyclist seen passing in the middle of a sword fight during the baby taxi chase sequence was in fact a bystander who passed through the shot, oblivious to the filming; his intrusion was captured by two cameras and left in the final film. Cameraman Alan Hume&#x27;s last scene was that of Octopussy&#x27;s followers rowing. That day, little time was left and it was decided to film the sunset at the eleventh hour.

The Fabergé egg in the film is based on a real one, made in 1897 and which was called the &quot;Coronation Egg&quot;. The egg in the film is listed in the auction catalogue as being &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot;, which is the name of one of Ian Fleming&#x27;s short stories released in more recent editions of the collection &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;.

In a bit of diegesis that &quot;breaks the fourth wall&quot;, Vijay signals his affiliation to MI6 by playing the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; on a recorder while Bond is disembarking from a boat in the harbour near the City Palace. Like his fictional counterpart, the real Vijay had a distinct fear of snakes and found it difficult to hold the basket during filming.

===Music===
After being absent in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; due to tax problems, John Barry returned to do his ninth Bond score. Barry made frequent references to the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; to reinforce &quot;Octopussy&quot; as the official Bond film, given that the motif could not be featured in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, and opted to include only subtle references to the music of India, avoiding instruments such as the sitar for feeling that authentic music &quot;didn&#x27;t work dramatically&quot;. He also wrote opening theme &quot;All Time High&quot; with lyricist Tim Rice. &quot;All Time High&quot;, sung by Rita Coolidge, is one of seven musical themes in the James Bond series whose song titles do not refer to the film&#x27;s title. &quot;All Time High&quot; spent four weeks at number one on the United States&#x27; Adult Contemporary singles chart and reached number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The soundtrack album was released in 1985 by A&amp;M Records; the compact disc version of this release was recalled due to a colour printing error which omitted the credits from the album cover, making it a rare collector&#x27;s item. In 1997, the soundtrack was re-issued by Rykodisc, with the original soundtrack music and some film dialogue, on an Enhanced CD version. The 2003 release, by EMI, restored the original soundtrack music without dialogue.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Octopussy&quot; was the first Bond film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had absorbed United Artists, the previous distributor of Eon Bond films. &quot;Octopussy&quot; premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 6 June 1983, with the Prince and Princess of Wales in attendance. The film earned slightly less than &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, but still grossed $187.5 million, with $67.8 million in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed £8.3 million ($14.9 million). Other large international grosses include $15.7 million in Germany, $15.1 million in Japan and $9.1 million in France. The film also performed better than &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, the non-Eon Bond remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot; which was released a few months later and grossed $55 million in the United States and Canada. At the 11th Saturn Awards, Maud Adams was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The film won the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing. In Germany, it won the Golden Screen Award for selling over 3 million tickets.

===Contemporary reviews===
Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt &quot;Octopussy&quot; was &quot;one of the snazziest, wittiest productions&quot; of the film series, in which he praised John Glen&#x27;s direction, Louis Jourdan&#x27;s performance, and the screenplay. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby praised the film, but noted how &quot;much of the story is incomprehensible&quot;. Gene Siskel, reviewing for &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, awarded the film three stars out of four, stating it is &quot;surprisingly entertaining—surprising because in his previous five Bond appearances Roger Moore has always come off as a smug stiff. In &quot;Octopussy&quot; Moore relaxes a bit and, just as important, his role is subordinated to the film&#x27;s many and extremely exciting action scenes. &quot;Octopussy&quot; has the most sustained excitement in a Bond film since &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.&quot; However, he felt that the character Octopussy was detrimental to the film and the action &quot;blunts a script that is weak on characterization and long on male chauvinism&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; felt the film&#x27;s strong points were &quot;the spectacular aerial stuntwork marking both the pre-credits teaser and extremely dangerous-looking climax. The rest of the action scenes are well-executed but suffer from a sense of deja vu, as in a speeding train that recalls Sean Connery&#x27;s derring-do in &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt the film proved &quot;to be business as usual, no better or worse than most of its predecessors. After all this time, it&#x27;s amazing that the same old formula still plays: the gadgetry, gorgeous girls, travelogue locales and the shameless double-entendres—in this instance, octo-entendres.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine negatively reviewed Moore&#x27;s performance, writing he has &quot;degenerated [Bond] into a male model, and something of a genial anachronism.&quot; Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t treat itself seriously for a moment ...Bond has now become almost totally absurdist, a parody of a parody. The film effectively disarms criticism, except that one might wish for the public to flock to something other than the technically ambitious.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 42% based on 50 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Despite a couple of electrifying action sequences, &quot;Octopussy&quot; is a formulaic, anachronistic Bond outing.&quot; 

James Berardinelli said that the movie was long and confusing, and strongly criticised Steven Berkoff&#x27;s performance, describing it as &quot;offensively bad&quot; and the worst performance of any Bond villain. A particular point of contention are comedic scenes where Bond is dressed in a clown costume, a gorilla outfit and doing a Tarzan yell during a jungle chase. As a result, it frequently ranks low in rankings of James Bond films, such as the ones by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, MSN, and IGN. C. J. Henderson reviewed &quot;Octopussy&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; magazine, writing &quot;there isn&#x27;t a moment in the movie when we worry for the slightest instant that anything could happen to suave ol&#x27; James. Predictably, it doesn&#x27;t. To kill Bond would be to lose the most bankable genre character ever brought to the movies.&quot;

By contrast, the elegance of the film locations in India, and the stunts on the aircraft and train were appreciated. &quot;GQ&quot; writer David Williams said &quot;Octopussy&quot; was &quot;one of the best &#x27;Bad Films&#x27; of the franchise&quot;, praising the entertaining characters but finding the silliness and Moore&#x27;s advanced age problematic. Danny Peary wrote that &quot;Octopussy&quot; &quot;has slow spots, little humour, and villains who aren&#x27;t nearly of the calibre of Dr. No, Goldfinger, or Blofeld. Also, the filmmakers make the mistake of demeaning Bond by having him swing through the trees and emitting a Tarzan cry and having him hide in a gorilla suit and later disguise himself as a clown (who all the kids at the circus laugh at). It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re trying to remind us that everything is tongue-in-cheek, but that makes little sense, for the film is much more serious than typical Bond outings – in fact, it recalls the tone of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;.&quot;

===Character reviews===
In 2006, Fandango ranked the character Octopussy as one of the top-10 Bond girls, and described her as &quot;a powerful, impressive woman&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, however, ranked her as the 10th-worst Bond girl in one list in 2006 but as the best &quot;babe&quot; of the Roger Moore &quot;James Bond&quot; films in another list in 2008. A poll by Bond fans in 2008 elected Octopussy as the tenth-worst Bond Girl. Yahoo! Movies included the character in a 2012 list of the best Bond girl names, commenting: &quot;This Bond girl moniker was so good, they named the film after her!&quot;

=== Television ===
&quot;Octopussy&quot; premiered in North America on The ABC Sunday Night Movie on February 2, 1986. It placed third in its time period with a Nielsen Media Research household rating of 17.4, a 29% audience share, and approximately 25 million viewers. The movie started 18 minutes late due to an overrun earlier in the day of &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;, which may have negatively impacted its performance slightly (a key action sequence near the end of the film did not air until after 11:30pm in the Eastern Time Zone).

<doc id="541675" wikidata="Q24899277" url="?curid=541675" title="Mothering Sunday">
<text>Mothering Sunday is a day honouring mother churches, the church where one is baptised and becomes &quot;a child of the church&quot;, celebrated since the Middle Ages in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries on the fourth Sunday in Lent. On Mothering Sunday, Christians have historically visited their mother church—the church in which they received the sacrament of baptism. 

Constance Adelaide Smith revived its modern observance beginning in 1913 to honour Mother Church, &#x27;mothers of earthly homes&#x27;, the Virgin Mary (mother of Jesus), and Mother Nature. It gained popularity in response to the originally American Mother&#x27;s Day. The holiday is often known as &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; in the United Kingdom, and has become a secular celebration of mothers and motherhood.

== Mediaeval origin ==
Mothering Sunday coincides with Laetare Sunday, also called Mid-Lent Sunday or Refreshment Sunday, a day of respite from fasting halfway through the penitential season of Lent. Its association with mothering originates in the texts read during the Mass in the Middle Ages, appearing in the lectionary in sources as old as the Murbach lectionary from the 8th century. These include several references to mothers and metaphors for mothers.

The introit for the day is from Isaiah 66:10–11 and Psalm 122:1, using imagery of the New Jerusalem:

Rejoice ye with Jerusalem; and be ye glad for her, all ye that delight in her: exult and sing for joy with her, all ye that in sadness mourn for her; that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations. &quot;Psalm&quot;: I was glad when they said unto me, We will go into the house of the Lord.
Laetare Hierusalem et conventum facite omnes qui diligitis eam: gaudete cum laetitia, qui in tristitia fuistis, ut exsultetis et satiemini ab uberibus consolationis vestrae. &quot;Psalmus&quot;: Laetatus sum in his quae dicta sunt mihi: in domum Domini ibimus.

Commentators of the period associate this with the personification of the Church as the Bride of Christ or with the Virgin Mary.

The Epistle reading for the day is Galatians 4:21–31, Paul the Apostle&#x27;s analysis of the story of Hagar and Sarah, speaking of &#x27;Jerusalem … which is the mother of us all.&#x27; While acknowledging the significance of motherhood, Paul understands the story as an allegory, advocating for an understanding of motherhood that transcends the material world and fertility through quoting Isaiah 54:1:
Rejoice, you childless one, you who bear no children,
 burst into song and shout, you who endure no birth pangs;
for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous
 than the children of the one who is married.
The Gospel for the day is John 6:1–14, the story of the Feeding of the Five Thousand, which prompted the association between Mothering Sunday and the &#x27;Gifts of Mother Earth&#x27;.

Inspired by the &#x27;We will go into the house of the Lord&#x27; psalm, mediaeval people began to make processions to their local &#x27;mother church&#x27; on the day, typically the local cathedral. These could sometimes become unruly, as recorded by Robert Grosseteste (Letter 22.7):

In each and every church you should strictly prohibit one parish from fighting with another over whose banners should come first in processions at the time of the annual visitation and veneration of the mother church. […] Those who dishonour their spiritual mother should not at all escape punishment, when those who dishonour their fleshly mothers are, in accordance with God&#x27;s law, cursed and punished with death.

== Early modern continuation ==

After the English Reformation, the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; continued to assign the same readings. During the 16th century, Christians continued to return to their local mother churches for a service held on Laetare Sunday. In this context, one&#x27;s mother church was either the church where one was baptised, the local parish church, or the nearest cathedral (the latter being the mother church of all the parish churches in a diocese). Anyone who did this was commonly said to have gone &#x27;mothering&#x27;, a term recorded by 1644:
Every Midlent Sunday is a great day at Worcester, when all the children and godchildren meet at the head and cheife of the family and have a feast. They call it the Mothering-day.
In later times, Mothering Sunday became a day when domestic servants were given a day off to visit their mother church, usually with their own mothers and other family members.

== Revival ==
Reacting to Anna Jarvis&#x27;s efforts to establish Mother&#x27;s Day in 1913, Constance Penswick Smith created the Mothering Sunday Movement.

Smith published a play, &quot;In Praise of Mother: A story of Mothering Sunday&quot; (1913), as well as &quot;A Short History of Mothering Sunday&quot; (1915), which went through several editions. Her most influential booklet was &quot;The Revival of Mothering Sunday&quot; (1921). This book has a series of four chapters outlining the different aspects of motherhood that the day should honour beyond a strictly biological one:

* &#x27;The Church – Our Mother&#x27;
* &#x27;Mothers of Earthly Homes&#x27;
* &#x27;The Mother of Jesus&#x27;
* &#x27;Gifts of Mother Earth&#x27;

By the 1950s, the occasion was celebrated across the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries.

The Church of England, as with other Christian denominations, invites people on Mothering Sunday to visit the parish church or cathedral in which they received the sacrament of baptism.

In modern Britain, &#x27;Mother&#x27;s Day&#x27; has become another term for Mothering Sunday in commercial contexts due to American influence, but it continues to be held during Lent. The holiday has also gained secular observance in Britain as a celebration of motherhood, following the American tradition, rather than its original religious meaning.

== Cakes, buns and violets ==
Reflecting the day&#x27;s association with the story of the Feeding of the Five Thousand and the reprieve from fasting, various types of cakes and buns have long been made for Mothering Sunday, especially Simnel cake, as gifts to parents. This is a traditional confection associated with both Mothering Sunday and Easter. In Bristol and some other parts of the world, mothering buns remain a speciality for Mothering Sunday: &quot;plain yeast-leavened buns, iced, and sprinkled with hundreds and thousands, eaten for breakfast on that day&quot;.

Numerous newspapers across many decades attest to children gathering violets to present to their mothers on this day. In urban settings, churches supply the violets to the children.

== Dates ==
Mothering Sunday always falls on the fourth Sunday in Lent (Laetare Sunday), 3 weeks before Easter Sunday.

<text>A standards organization, standards body, standards developing organization (SDO), or standards setting organization (SSO) is an organization whose primary function is developing, coordinating, promulgating, revising, amending, reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise contributing to the usefulness of technical standards to those who employ them. Such an organization works to create uniformity across producers, consumers, government agencies, and other relevant parties regarding terminology, product specifications (e.g. size, including units of measure), protocols, and more. Its goals could include ensuring that Company A&#x27;s external hard drive works on Company B&#x27;s computer, an individual&#x27;s blood pressure measures the same with Company C&#x27;s sphygmomanometer as it does with Company D&#x27;s, or that all shirts that should not be ironed have the same icon (a clothes iron crossed out with an X) on the label.

Most standards are voluntary in the sense that they are offered for adoption by people or industry without being mandated in law. Some standards become mandatory when they are adopted by regulators as legal requirements in particular domains, often for the purpose of safety or for consumer protection act from deceitful practices.

The term &quot;formal standard&quot; refers specifically to a specification that has been approved by a standards setting organization. The term &quot;de jure standard&quot; refers to a standard mandated by legal requirements or refers generally to any formal standard. In contrast, the term &quot;de facto standard&quot; refers to a specification (or protocol or technology) that has achieved widespread use and acceptance – often without being approved by any standards organization (or receiving such approval only after it already has achieved widespread use). Examples of de facto standards that were not approved by any standards organizations (or at least not approved until after they were in widespread &quot;de facto&quot; use) include the Hayes command set developed by Hayes, Apple&#x27;s TrueType font design and the PCL protocol used by Hewlett-Packard in the computer printers they produced.

Normally, the term &quot;standards organization&quot; is not used to refer to the individual parties participating within the standards developing organization in the capacity of founders, benefactors, stakeholders, members or contributors, who themselves may function as or lead the standards organizations.

==History==

===Standardization===

The implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the need for high-precision machine tools and interchangeable parts. Henry Maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800, which allowed for the standardization of screw thread sizes for the first time.

Maudslay&#x27;s work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies&#x27; in-house standards also began to spread more widely within their industries. Joseph Whitworth&#x27;s screw thread measurements were adopted as the first (unofficial) national standard by companies around Britain in 1841. It came to be known as the British Standard Whitworth, and was widely adopted in other countries.

===Early standards organizations===
By the end of the 19th century differences in standards between companies was making trade increasingly difficult and strained. For instance, in 1895 an iron and steel dealer recorded his displeasure in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;Architects and engineers generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or given work that anything like economical and continuous manufacture becomes impossible. In this country no two professional men are agreed upon the size and weight of a girder to employ for given work&quot;.

The Engineering Standards Committee was established in London in 1901 as the world&#x27;s first national standards body. It subsequently extended its standardization work and became the British Engineering Standards Association in 1918, adopting the name British Standards Institution in 1931 after receiving its Royal Charter in 1929. The national standards were adopted universally throughout the country, and enabled the markets to act more rationally and efficiently, with an increased level of cooperation.

After the First World War, similar national bodies were established in other countries. The was set up in Germany in 1917, followed by its counterparts, the American National Standard Institute and the French Commission Permanente de Standardisation, both in 1918.

===International organizations===
Several international organizations create international standards, such as Codex Alimentarius in food, the World Health Organization Guidelines in health, or ITU Recommendations in ICT and being publicly funded, are freely available for consideration and use worldwide.

===International standards associations===
In 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, as part of a delegation by the Institute of Electrical Engineers. He presented a paper on standardization, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process. By 1906, his work was complete and he drew up a permanent terms for the International Electrotechnical Commission. The body held its first meeting that year in London, with representatives from 14 countries. In honour of his contribution to electrical standardization, Lord Kelvin was elected as the body&#x27;s first President.
The International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA) was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications. The body was suspended in 1942 during World War II.

After the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization; the new organization officially began operations in February 1947.

==Overview==
Standards organizations can be classified by their role, position, and the extent of their influence on the local, national, regional, and global standardization arena.

By geographic designation, there are international, regional, and national standards bodies (the latter often referred to as NSBs). By technology or industry designation, there are standards developing organizations (SDOs) and also standards setting organizations (SSOs) also known as consortia. Standards organizations may be governmental, quasi-governmental or non-governmental entities. Quasi- and non-governmental standards organizations are often non-profit organizations.

=== International standards organizations ===

Broadly, an international standards organization develops international standards (this does not necessarily restrict the use of other published standards internationally).

There are many international standards organizations. The three largest and most well-established such organizations are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which have each existed for more than 50 years (founded in 1947, 1906, and 1865, respectively) and are all based in Geneva, Switzerland. They have established tens of thousands of standards covering almost every conceivable topic. Many of these are then adopted worldwide replacing various incompatible &quot;homegrown&quot; standards. Many of these standards are naturally evolved from those designed in-house within an industry, or by a particular country, while others have been built from scratch by groups of experts who sit on various technical committees (TCs). These three organizations together comprise the World Standards Cooperation (WSC) alliance.

ISO is composed of the national standards bodies (NSBs), one per member economy. The IEC is similarly composed of national committees, one per member economy. In some cases, the national committee to the IEC of an economy may also be the ISO member from that country or economy. ISO and IEC are private international organizations that are not established by any international treaty. Their members may be non-governmental organizations or governmental agencies, as selected by ISO and IEC (which are privately established organizations).

The ITU is a treaty-based organization established as a permanent agency of the United Nations, in which governments are the primary members, although other organizations (such as non-governmental organizations and individual companies) can also hold a form of direct membership status in the ITU as well. Another example of a treaty-based international standards organization with government membership is the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

In addition to these, a large variety of independent international standards organizations such as the ASME, ASTM International, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), the IEEE, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), SAE International, TAPPI, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and the Universal Postal Union (UPU) develop and publish standards for a variety of international uses. In many such cases, these international standards organizations are not based on the principle of one member per country. Rather, membership in such organizations is open to those interested in joining and willing to agree to the organization&#x27;s by-laws – having either organizational/corporate or individual technical experts as members.

The Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) was formed in 1949 to prepare avionics system engineering standards with other aviation organizations RTCA, EUROCAE, and ICAO. The standards are widely known as the ARINC Standards.

=== Regional standards organizations ===
Regional standards bodies also exist, such as the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) in Europe, the Pacific Area Standards Congress (PASC), the Pan American Standards Commission (COPANT), the African Organisation for Standardisation (ARSO), the Arabic industrial development and mining organization (AIDMO), and others.

In the European Union, only standards created by CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI are recognized as &quot;European standards&quot; (according to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012), and member states are required to notify the European Commission and each other about all the draft technical regulations concerning ICT products and services before they are adopted in national law. These rules were laid down in Directive 98/34/EC with the goal of providing transparency and control with regard to technical regulations.

Sub-regional standards organizations also exist such as the MERCOSUR Standardization Association (AMN), the CARICOM Regional Organisation for Standards and Quality (CROSQ), and the ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ), EAC East Africa Standards Committee www.eac-quality.net, and the GCC Standardization Organization (GSO) for Arab States of the Persian Gulf.

=== National standards bodies ===
In general, each country or economy has a single recognized national standards body (NSB). A national standards body is likely the sole member from that economy in ISO; ISO currently has 161 members. National standards bodies usually do not prepare the technical content of standards, which instead is developed by national technical societies.

NSBs may be either public or private sector organizations, or combinations of the two. For example, the Standards Council of Canada is a Canadian Crown Corporation, Dirección General de Normas is a governmental agency within the Mexican Ministry of Economy, and ANSI is a 501(c)(3) non-profit U.S. organization with members from both the private and public sectors. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. government&#x27;s standards agency, cooperates with ANSI under a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on the United States Standards Strategy. The determinates of whether an NSB for a particular economy is a public or private sector body may include the historical and traditional roles that the private sector fills in public affairs in that economy or the development stage of that economy.

=== Standards developing organizations (SDOs) ===
A &quot;national standards body&quot; (NSB) generally refers to one standardization organization that is that country&#x27;s member of the ISO. A &quot;standards developing organization&quot; (SDO) is one of the thousands of industry- or sector-based standards organizations that develop and publish industry specific standards. Some economies feature only an NSB with no other SDOs. Large economies like the United States and Japan have several hundred SDOs, many of which are coordinated by the central NSBs of each country (ANSI and JISC in this case). In some cases, international industry-based SDOs such as the CIE, the IEEE and the Audio Engineering Society (AES) may have direct liaisons with international standards organizations, having input to international standards without going through a national standards body. SDOs are differentiated from standards setting organizations (SSOs) in that SDOs may be accredited to develop standards using open and transparent processes.

=== Scope of work ===
Developers of technical standards are generally concerned with interface standards, which detail how products interconnect with each other, and safety standards, which established characteristics ensure that a product or process is safe for humans, animals, and the environment. The subject of their work can be narrow or broad. Another area of interest is in defining how the behavior and performance of products is measured and described in data sheets.

Overlapping or competing standards bodies tend to cooperate purposefully, by seeking to define boundaries between the scope of their work, and by operating in a hierarchical fashion in terms of national, regional and international scope; international organizations tend to have as members national organizations; and standards emerging at national level (such as BS 5750) can be adopted at regional levels (BS 5750 was adopted as EN 29000) and at international levels (BS 5750 was adopted as ISO 9000).

Unless adopted by a government, standards carry no force in law. However, most jurisdictions have truth in advertising laws, and ambiguities can be reduced if a company offers a product that is &quot;compliant&quot; with a standard.

=== Standards development process ===
When an organization develops standards that may be used openly, it is common to have formal rules published regarding the process. This may include:
* Who is allowed to vote and provide input on new or revised standards
* What is the formal step-by-step process
* How are bias and commercial interests handled
* How negative votes or ballots are handled
* What type of consensus is required

Though it can be a tedious and lengthy process, formal standard setting is essential to developing new technologies. For example, since 1865, the telecommunications industry has depended on the ITU to establish the telecommunications standards that have been adopted worldwide. The ITU has created numerous telecommunications standards including telegraph specifications, allocation of telephone numbers, interference protection, and protocols for a variety of communications technologies. The standards that are created through standards organizations lead to improved product quality, ensured interoperability of competitors&#x27; products, and they provide a technological baseline for future research and product development. Formal standard setting through standards organizations has numerous benefits for consumers including increased innovation, multiple market participants, reduced production costs, and the efficiency effects of product interchangeability. To support the standard development process, ISO published Good Standardization Practices (GSP) and the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee published the &quot;Six Principles&quot; guiding members in the development of international standards.

=== Standards distribution and copyright ===
Some standards – such as the SIF Specification in K12 education – are managed by a non-profit organizations composed of public entities and private entities working in cooperation that then publish the standards under an open license at no charge and requiring no registration.

A technical library at a university may have copies of technical standards on hand. Major libraries in large cities may also have access to many technical standards.

Some users of standards mistakenly assume that all standards are in the public domain. This assumption is correct only for standards produced by the central governments whose publications are not amenable to copyright or to organizations that issue their standard under an open license. Any standards produced by non-governmental entities remain the intellectual property of their developers (unless specifically designed otherwise) and are protected, just like any other publications, by copyright laws and international treaties. However, the intellectual property extends only to the standard itself and not to its use. For instance if a company sells a device that is compliant with a given standard, it is not liable for further payment to the standards organization except in the special case when the organization holds patent rights or some other ownership of the intellectual property described in the standard.

It is, however, liable for any patent infringement by its implementation, just as with any other implementation of technology. The standards organizations give no guarantees that patents relevant to a given standard have been identified. ISO standards draw attention to this in the foreword with a statement like the following: &quot;Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights&quot;. If the standards organization is aware that parts of a given standard fall under patent protection, it will often require the patent holder to agree to Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing before including it in the standard. Such an agreement is regarded as a legally binding contract, as in the 2012 case &quot;Microsoft v. Motorola&quot;.

== Trends ==
The ever-quickening pace of technology evolution is now more than ever affecting the way new standards are proposed, developed and implemented.

Since traditional, widely respected standards organizations tend to operate at a slower pace than technology evolves, many standards they develop are becoming less relevant because of the inability of their developers to keep abreast with the technological innovation. As a result, a new class of standards setters appeared on the standardization arena: the industry consortia or standards setting organizations (SSOs), which are also referred to as private standards. Despite having limited financial resources, some of them enjoy truly international acceptance. One example is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), whose standards for HTML, CSS, and XML are used universally. There are also community-driven associations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a worldwide network of volunteers who collaborate to set standards for internet protocols.

Some industry-driven standards development efforts don&#x27;t even have a formal organizational structure. They are projects funded by large corporations. Among them are the OpenOffice.org, an Apache Software Foundation-sponsored international community of volunteers working on an open-standard software that aims to compete with Microsoft Office, and two commercial groups competing fiercely with each other to develop an industry-wide standard for high-density optical storage. Another example is the Global Food Safety Initiative where members of the Consumer Goods Forum define benchmarking requirements for harmonization and recognize scheme owners using private standards for food safety.

<text>Zoltán Kocsis (; 30 May 1952 – 6 November 2016) was a Hungarian pianist, conductor and composer.

==Biography==

===Studies===
Born in Budapest, he began his musical studies at the age of five and continued them at the Béla Bartók Conservatory in 1963, studying piano and composition. In 1968 he was admitted to the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, where he was a pupil of Pál Kadosa, Ferenc Rados and György Kurtág, graduating in 1973.

===Career===

He won the Hungarian Radio Beethoven Competition in 1970, and made his first concert tour of the United States in the following year. He received the Liszt Prize in 1973, and the Kossuth Prize in 1978.

Kocsis performed with the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Philharmonia of London, and the Vienna Philharmonic. Kocsis recorded the complete solo piano works and works with piano and orchestra of Béla Bartók. In 1990, his recording of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Images&quot; won &quot;The Gramophone&quot; Instrumental Award for that year. He won another with the violinist Barnabás Kelemen in 2013 in the chamber category for the recording of Bartók&#x27;s Violin Sonatas Nos 1 &amp; 2.

American critic Harold C. Schonberg praised Kocsis&#x27; extraordinary technique and fine piano tone. According to &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, he had &quot;an impressive technique, and his forthright, strongly rhythmic playing is nevertheless deeply felt and never mechanical. Kocsis has a natural affinity for Bach, but is also a fine exponent of contemporary music and has given the first performances of works by Kurtág.&quot;

===Conductor===
Kocsis co-founded with Iván Fischer the Budapest Festival Orchestra in 1983, thus opening a new epoch in the history of Hungarian orchestral playing. Kocsis played a key role in the direction and the development of the program policy of the orchestra from its founding, and from 1987 also appeared as a conductor at their concerts.

He became the musical director of the Hungarian National Philharmonic in 1997 and held the title until his death in 2016.

===Compositions===
In addition to his compositions, Kocsis made piano transcriptions of works by Wagner, Rachmaninov, Bartók and Debussy. Kocsis completed the last act of Schoenberg&#x27;s opera &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, with the permission of Schoenberg&#x27;s heirs, in 2010.

===Personal life===

He was married to pianist Adrienne Hauser from 1986. They had two children, Mark and Rita. In 1997 he married pianist Erika Tóth. They had a son, Krisztian, also a pianist, and a daughter, Viktoria.
Kocsis died following a long illness after undergoing heart surgery on 6 November 2016, aged 64, in his native Budapest.
