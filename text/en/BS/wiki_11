<text>Flag desecration is the desecration of a flag, violation of flag protocol, or various acts that intentionally destroy, damage, or mutilate a flag in public. In the case of a national flag, such action is often intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws against methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between the desecration of the country&#x27;s own national flag and the desecration of flags of other countries. Some countries have also banned the desecration of all types of flags from inside the country to other country flags.
==Background==
Actions that may be treated as the desecration of a flag include burning it, urinating or defecating on it, defacing it with slogans, stepping upon it, damaging it with stones; bullets; or any other projectile, cutting or ripping it, improperly flying it, verbally insulting it, dragging it on the ground, or eating it, among other things.

Flag desecration may be undertaken for a variety of reasons. It may be a protest against a country&#x27;s foreign policy, including one&#x27;s own, or the nature of the government in power there. It may be a protest against nationalism or a deliberate and symbolic insult to the people of the country represented by the flag. It may also be a protest at the very laws prohibiting the act of desecrating a flag.

=== Flag desecration laws ===
In some countries, desecrating a flag is a crime and may result in punishment, such as a prison sentence or a fine. In countries where it is not, the act may still be prosecuted as disorderly conduct or arson or, if conducted on someone else&#x27;s property, as theft or vandalism.

== By jurisdiction ==

===Algeria===
In Algeria, flag desecration is a crime. According to article 160 of the Algerian penal code, the intentional and public shredding, distortion, or desecration of the national flag results in five to ten years of imprisonment as punishment.

In 2010, an Algerian court convicted 18 people of flag desecration and punished them by up to six years of imprisonment and $10,000 in fines after protests about jobs and housing.

===Argentina===
The Penal Code (Código Penal) on its Article 222 criminalizes the public desecration of the national flag, coat of arms, national anthem, or any provincial symbol, imposing one to four years of imprisonment. In other words, in Argentina, flag desecration is a crime, resulting in a punishment of up to one year of imprisonment.

=== Armenia ===
The Armenian criminal code punishes any insult to the flag (as well as to the coat of arms and the national anthem) with community service of up to two years or imprisonment of up to one year.

===Australia===

====Legality====
Flag desecration is not, in itself, illegal in Australia. However, flag desecration must be compliant with the law.

In &quot;Coleman v Kinbacher &amp; Anor (Qld Police)&quot;, Coleman was successfully prosecuted for flag burning, not because of its political nature, but because given the size of the flag, the use of petrol as an accelerant, and the fact that it was in an open park area, many members of the public experienced &quot;concern, fright and anger&quot;, and in these circumstances flag burning could be considered disorderly conduct.

====Attempts to ban flag burning====
There have been several attempts to pass bills making flag burning illegal in Australia, none of which have yet been successful. In 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, National Party MP Michael Cobb introduced bills making it an offence to desecrate, dishonour, burn, mutilate or destroy the Australian national flag. On each occasion, the bill failed. As of May 2016, the most recent bill which attempted to ban flag burning was the &quot;Flags Amendment (Protecting Australian Flags) Bill 2016&quot;, which was introduced by National Party MP George Christensen but lapsed in April 2016.

====Historical occurrences====
During the 2005 Cronulla riots, a Lebanese-Australian youth, whose name has been kept secret, climbed a Returned and Services League (RSL) club building and tore down its flag before setting it on fire. The youth was sentenced to 12 months probation not for flag desecration but for the destruction of property of the RSL. In October of that year the youth accepted an invitation from the RSL to carry the Australian flag along with war veterans in the Anzac Day march the following year. However, the RSL was forced to withdraw this invitation as it received phone calls from people threatening to pelt the youth with missiles on the day. The head of the New South Wales RSL was quoted as saying that &quot;the people who made these threats ought to be bloody ashamed of themselves&quot;.

In 2006, Australian contemporary artist Azlan McLennan burnt an Australian flag and displayed it on a billboard outside the Trocadero artspace in Footscray, Victoria. He called the artpiece &quot;Proudly UnAustralian&quot;.

The socialist youth group Resistance marketed &quot;flag-burning kits&quot;inspired by, and to protest, the censorship of Azlan McLennan&#x27;s artto university students.

Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre worker Adam Thompson burned the Australian flag on the week of Australia Day (2008) celebrations in Launceston&#x27;s City Park to the cheers of about 100 people, who were rallying against what they call &quot;Invasion Day&quot;.

Tent embassy activists burned the Australian flag on 27 January 2012 at the entrance to Canberra&#x27;s Parliament House as they called for Aboriginal sovereignty over Australia.

===Austria===
In Austria, flag desecration is illegal under §248 Strafgesetzbuch. Offenders can be fined or punished with up to six months of imprisonment. Under §317 Strafgesetzbuch desecration of flags of foreign states or international organizations can be punished if Austria maintains diplomatic relations with them or belongs to the respective organization.

=== Azerbaijan ===
The Criminal Code of Azerbaijan, Article 324, penalizes desecration of the national flag or state emblem with imprisonment for up to one year.

===Belgium===
Flag desecration is not illegal in Belgium. Flemish nationalists have burned Belgian flags on at least one occasion.

===Brazil===
Brazilian law number 5700, chapter V, from 1971, concerns respect and the national flag:

Article 30 states that, when in the flag is being marched or paraded (for example, when the national anthem is being played), everyone present must take a respectful attitude, standing in silence. Males must remove any head coverings. Military personnel must salute or present arms according to their corps&#x27; internal regulations.

Article 31 states that people are prohibited from:

Article 32 states that flags in a bad condition must be sent to the nearest military unit for incineration on Flag Day according to ceremonial procedures.

Article 33 states that, except at diplomatic missions such as embassies and consulates, no foreign flag may be flown without a Brazilian flag of the same size in a prominent position alongside it.

Chapter VI of the law states, in article 35, that the act of a civilian breaking this law is considered a misdemeanor, punished with a fine of one to four times the highest reference value active in the country, doubled in repeated infringement cases. In the Brazilian Armed Forces&#x27; Military Penal Code, article 161, a soldier, airman or seaman who disrespects any national symbol is punished with one to two years&#x27; detention; officers may be declared unsuitable for their rank. In other words, the desecration of a flag is illegal in Brazil, resulting in up to one month of imprisonment and a fine of up to ten reais as punishment.

===Bulgaria===
The desecration of any national symbol, including the national flag, is a crime in Bulgaria, resulting in up to two years of imprisonment as punishment and a fine of up to €1,600.

===Canada===

====Legality====
Flag desecration is not, in itself, a crime in Canada. Acts of this nature are forms of expression protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

In 1990, during heated political times around the Meech Lake Accord, the flag of Quebec was desecrated by protestors in Brockville, Ontario opposed to Quebec&#x27;s language laws after the Canadian flag had been burnt in protests in Quebec. Televised images of individuals stepping on the Quebec flag were played in Quebec and contributed to the deterioration in relations between Quebec and English Canada. The incident, seen as a metaphor of Canada&#x27;s perceived rejection of Quebec (and of Quebec&#x27;s distinctiveness in the demise of the Meech Lake Accord) was invoked by Quebec nationalists during the run-up to the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence and is still remembered today.

In 1999, members of the Westboro Baptist Church from the United States staged a burning of the Canadian Flag outside of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. This was to protest legalization of same-sex marriage which was being adjudicated by the Canadian court.

===Chile===
The &quot;Ley de Seguridad Interior del Estado&quot;, articles 6 and 7, defines as a crime the public desecration of the national flag, coat of arms, the name of the country or the national anthem, and imposes a period of imprisonment, relegation or estrangement for a period of up to one year.

===China===

Flag desecration is a crime in China. The penal code provides for up to three years of imprisonment criminal detention, public surveillance, or deprivation of political rights for &quot;whoever desecrates the National Flag or the National Emblem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China by intentionally burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling upon it in a public place&quot;.

====Hong Kong====

Chinese laws concerning flag desecration were incorporated into Hong Kong law as the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance in 1997 as required by Annex III of the territory&#x27;s constitution. The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance is the equivalent statute in respect of the Hong Kong flag. Both ordinances ban desecration of the Chinese flag and Hong Kong flag, respectively, through methods including &quot;burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling&quot;.

In 1999, two individuals were convicted for desecration of the Regional Flag of Hong Kong and the Chinese flag. They were found guilty by a magistrate, had the conviction overturned in the High Court but the convictions were restored by the Court of Final Appeal. They were bound over to keep the peace on their own recognisance of $2,000 for 12 months for each of the two charges. In the judgement, Chief Justice Andrew Li said although the Basic Law of Hong Kong guarantees freedom of speech, flag desecration is not legal because there are other protest methods.

Social activist Koo Sze-yiu has been convicted several times of flag desecration. He was sentenced to a nine-month prison term in 2013 for the offence. However, the sentence was reduced to four months and two weeks after an appeal. In March 2016, he was sentenced to a six-week prison term for burning the regional flag in Wanchai on HKSAR Establishment Day in 2015. Koo responded that &quot;he is happy to be punished as being jailed is part of the life of an activist, and he would continue to protest against the Beijing and Hong Kong governments and fight for democracy.&quot; In January 2021, Koo was again jailed, this time for four months, for displaying an inverted Chinese flag with slogans written on it in July 2020.

In October 2016, some miniature Chinese and Hong Kong flags that had been placed by pro-Beijing legislators in the Legislative Council chamber were flipped upside down by lawmaker Cheng Chung-tai, who regarded them as &quot;cheap patriotic acts&quot;. In April 2017 he was charged with flag desecration. He alleged that the arrest was part of a &quot;general cleansing&quot; of dissenting voices ahead of Carrie Lam&#x27;s inauguration as new chief executive. On 29 September 2017, the Eastern Magistrates&#x27; Court found Cheng guilty and fined him $5,000.

In December 2019, a 13-year-old girl was sentenced to 12 months probation for flag desecration during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. She received a curfew as well as a criminal record; the act was described as &quot;rash&quot; by magistrate Kelly Shui. Government intervention was on the basis of &quot;(Maliciously) challenging the national sovereignty&quot;.

===Croatia===
Croatian history recalls the burning of the flag of the Kingdom of Hungary during the 1895 visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Zagreb. Two people involved in the incident, Stjepan Radić and Vladimir Vidrić, later pursued notable careers in politics and literature, respectively. In modern Croatia, desecrating any national flag or treating any national flag in a disrespectful manner is a felony. Offenders can face up to one year of imprisonment.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, it is legal to burn or desecrate the national flag, the Dannebrog. However it is illegal to publicly burn or desecrate the flags of foreign countries, the United Nations and Council of Europe according to § 110e of the Danish penal code because Parliament has decided that burning or desecrating these is a matter of foreign relations, as it could be construed as a threat. This law is rarely enforced; the last conviction was in 1936.

====Faroe Islands====
In the autonomous Faroe Islands, the flag law states that the Faroese flag, &quot;Merkið&quot;, may not be desecrated, &quot;neither by words nor by deeds&quot;.

=== Dominican Republic ===
The law of patriotic symbols (Law 210-19) which among other things regulates the use of the national flag, states that any person who desecrates the flag may be punished with 1 to 3 months of imprisonment and a fine ranging from 5 to 20 minimum wages.

===Egypt===
Flag desecration has been illegal in Egypt since 2014. It results in a fine of up to 30,000 Egyptian pounds (about $4,300) as the punishment.

===Ethiopia===
In 2009, the Parliament of Ethiopia passed Proclamation 654/2009 (The Federal Flag Proclamation), which prohibited firstly amongst 23 other provisions &quot;use [of] the Flag without its Emblem&quot;, as well as &quot;to deface the Flag by writing or displaying signs, symbols, emblems or picture &quot;, or &quot;to prepare or use the Flag without the proper order of its colors and size or its Emblem.&quot; While most offenses were punishable by a fine of &quot;3000 birr or rigorous imprisonment up to one year&quot;, the first offense, mandating the usage of the emblem, received an increased penalty of &quot;5000 birr or the rigorous imprisonment of up to three years.&quot; This replaced the 1996 Flag Proclamation, which had made no mention of offenses or penalties.

===Finland===
According to the law on the Finnish flag, it is illegal to desecrate the flag, treat it in disrespecting manner, or remove it from a public place without permission.

===France===
According to French law, a person outraging the French national anthem or the French flag during an event organized or regulated by public authorities is liable to a fine of up to €7,500 and a punishment of up to six months of imprisonment if performing in a gathering. The law targets &quot;outrageous behaviour&quot; during public ceremonies and major sports events.

This clause was added as an amendment to a large bill dealing with internal security, in reaction to a football match during which there had been whistles against &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, but also to similar actions during public ceremonies. The amendment initially prohibited such behaviour regardless of the context, but a parliamentary commission later restricted its scope to events organized or regulated by public authorities, which is to be understood, according to the ruling of the Constitutional Council, as events organized by public authorities, mass sport matches and other mass events taking place in enclosures, but not private speech, literary or artistic works, or speech during events not organized or regulated by public authorities.

In 2006, a man who had publicly burnt a French flag stolen from the façade of the city hall of Aurillac during a public festival, organized and regulated by public authorities, was fined €300.

A July 2010 law makes it a crime to desecrate the French national flag in a public place, but also to distribute images of a flag desecration, even when done in a private setting, if the objective is to create trouble in public space. On 22 December 2010, an Algerian national was the first person to be convicted under the new status, and ordered to pay a €750 after breaking the pole of a flag hung in the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture a day prior.

===Germany===

Under the German criminal code (§90a Strafgesetzbuch (StGB)), it is illegal to revile or damage the German federal flag as well as any flags of its states in public. Offenders can be fined or sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison, or fined or sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison if the act was intentionally used to support the eradication of the Federal Republic of Germany or to violate constitutional rights. Actual convictions because of a violation of the criminal code need to be balanced against the constitutional right of the freedom of expression, as ruled multiple times by Germany&#x27;s constitutional court.

The original law from 1932 was expanded in 1935 to include the flag of Nazi Germany.

As of 2020, it also results in up to three years of imprisonment as punishment for damaging or reviling the flag of any foreign country (§104 StGB). Until then, only flags that were shown publicly by tradition, event, or routinely by representatives of an official foreign entity were protected. The legislative reform to include also unofficially or privately used flags was an explicit reaction to the repeated burning of Israeli flags during anti-Israeli protests.

As part of that reform, a newly formed §90c StGB was introduced that extends the scope of protection to the flag and anthem of the European Union.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, some East Germans cut out the emblem from their national flag in support for a reunified, democratic Germany. This flag is now used by the Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship.

===Greece===
Under article 188 of Greece&#x27;s Penal code, flag desecration, along with the desecration of other Greek symbols, is illegal and results in up to two years of imprisonment as punishment.

===Hungary===

Desecration of the national flag is illegal in Hungary.

During a demonstration at the beginning of the Hungarian revolution of 1956 someone in the crowd cut out the communist coat of arms from the Hungarian flag, leaving a distinctive hole, and others quickly followed suit. The &quot;flag with a hole&quot; became a symbol of the Hungarian resistance. The practice of cutting out the communist coat of arms was also followed by other Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania, especially during the Revolutions of 1989.

===India===

The Indian Flag Code is a set of laws that govern the usage of the Flag of India. The Bureau of Indian Standards is in charge of the enforcement of the manufacture of the flag according to the guidelines.

Violation of the code may invite severe punishments and penalties. The code was written in 2002 and merged the following acts: provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 (No.12 of 1950) and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 (No. 69 of 1971).

The Indian Flag Code was often criticized for being too rigid and prevented ordinary citizens from displaying the flag on homes and other buildings. For many years, only government officials and other government buildings could unfurl the flag. That changed in 2001 when Naveen Jindal won a court case in the Supreme Court of India to give Indians the right to unfurl the flag publicly. The Indian cricket batsman Sachin Tendulkar was accused of sporting the flag on his cricket helmet below the BCCI emblem. He later changed it and placed the flag above the emblem. The flag code was updated in 2005; some new provisions include that the flag cannot be worn under the waist or on undergarments.

===Indonesia===
Article 24 of Law No. 24/2009 on Flags, Language, National Symbols, and Anthems, states that people are prohibited from:&lt;ref name=&quot;UU No 24/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

# destroying, tearing, trampling, burning, or performing other actions with the intention to tarnish, insult, or degrade the honour of the national flag;
# using the national flag for billboards or commercials;
# flying the national flag if it is damaged, torn, smudged, crumpled, or faded;
# printing on, embroidering or adding letters, numbers, images or other signs, or adding badges or any objects to the national flag;
# using the national flag to cover a ceiling or roof, or for wrapping or covering goods in a way that can degrade the honor of the national flag.

Article 66 and 67 of Law No. 24/2009 states that anyone who commits any of these prohibited acts may face up to ten years of imprisonment as punishment or a fine of up to a billion rupiah.

===Iran===
In Iran, flag desecration is a crime.

===Iraq===
In 2004, many copies of the proposed new flag for Iraq were burnt (see flag of Iraq). There were no such examples of burning the current Iraqi national flags, even by political opponents, as both contain the &quot;takbir&quot;, so this would be seen as a religious insult in Islam.

===Ireland===

The Department of the Taoiseach&#x27;s guide to the flag of Ireland includes a list of &quot;practices to avoid&quot;. This states in part &quot;The National Flag should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos, lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events.&quot; A tricolour inscribed &quot;Davy Keogh says hello&quot; waved continually since 1981 has given its eponymous bearer a modicum of fame among Republic of Ireland soccer supporters. Guinness ran a promotion before the 2002 FIFA World Cup distributing Irish flags to supporters in pubs, on which the tricolour&#x27;s white band was defaced with Guinness&#x27;s harp logo (which is similar to, but different from, the harp on the Irish coat of arms). Guinness apologised after public criticism. Cecilia Keaveney said in a subsequent Dáil debate, &quot;It may not be possible to address defacing the flag through legislation, but the House must issue a strong message that this is unacceptable.&quot;

Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s 1926 play &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; attracted controversy for its critical view of the Easter Rising, in particular a scene in which a tricolour is brought into a pub frequented by a prostitute. On 7 May 1945, the day before V-E Day, celebrating unionist students in Trinity College Dublin raised the flags of the victorious Allies over the college; when onlookers in College Green began jeering, some took down the flag of neutral Ireland, set fire to it and tossed it away, provoking a small riot. In response, nationalist students from University College Dublin, including future Taoiseach Charles Haughey, burned the British flag in Grafton Street. The Provost of Trinity College apologised for the incident, which was not reported in Irish newspapers owing to wartime censorship.

===Israel===

In 2007, six teenagers in the South Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam were arrested directly for burning an Israeli flag. This incident was considered serious by the police and others since the youths were suspected in other acts of vandalism and claimed to be Satanists.

In 2022, Israel passed a new amendment, meaning those convicted of deliberately burning an Israeli flag, face up to two years in prison.

===Italy===
In Italy, the desecration of any Italian or foreign nation&#x27;s national flag (&quot;vilipendio alla bandiera&quot;) is prohibited by law (Article 292 of the Italian Penal Code) and punished with fines (between and euros) for verbal desecration and with imprisonment (up to two years) for physical damage or destruction.

===Jamaica===
Flag desecration is considered legal in Jamaica, especially because it is part of flag protocol to dispose of it when it is torn.

A German advert depicted the flag being torched in a coffee shop.

===Japan===

In Japan, under Chapter 4, Article 92 of the Criminal Code, the desecration of a recognized foreign nation&#x27;s national flag and symbol to dishonour that particular nation is illegal and results in fine or penal labour, but only on complaint by the foreign government.

In May 1958, the flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the &quot;Wǔ Xīng Hóngqí&quot;, at a postage stamp convention was pulled down and damaged, but as Japan did not recognize the PRC at the time, the law was not applied. In February 2011, Japanese ultra-rightists held a protest over the Kuril Islands dispute outside of the Russian embassy in Tokyo, during which they dragged a Russian flag on the ground; Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov stated that his ministry had asked the Japanese government to launch a criminal case over the incident.

However, the desecration of the Japanese flag, the &quot;Hinomaru&quot;, has never been a crime. Absent from such law, the act of desecration is implicitly protected by Article 21 covering freedom of speech in the Constitution of Japan.

On 26 October 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the &quot;Hinomaru&quot;, before the start of the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the national flag not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the wartime Japanese army and the continued Japanese-requested presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of &quot;Kimigayo&quot;.

In late January 2021, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party announced its intention to pass a law in the Diet to prohibit the desecration of the &quot;Hinomaru&quot;.

On April 13, 2022, Japan made the desecration of foreign flags legal.

=== Kazakhstan ===
In Kazakhstan, under Chapter 14, Article 317 of the Criminal Code, an individual involved in flag desecration (including any state symbol) could face up to a fine of 3,000 monthly calculation index (10,350,000 tenge as of 2023). Additionally, they could be sentenced to up to two years of house arrest or imprisonment and may also be required to perform up to 900 hours of community service.

===Lithuania===
The desecration of the national flag, coat of arms or anthem of Lithuania results in an arrest or up to 2 years of imprisonment, or other fines, as the punishment or penalty.

===Malaysia===
While Malaysia does not have specific legislation regarding flag desecration, legal action can be taken against those who show disrespect towards the national flag &quot;Jalur Gemilang&quot; under the Penal Code (Act 574), Sedition Act 1948 (Act 15) and the Emblems &amp; Names (Prevention of Control of Improper Use) 1963 (Act 193). In October 2013, the Law Minister Nancy Shukri announced that the Government would be removing the proposed Clause 5 amendment to the Penal Code, which proposed fining or jailing anyone charged with desecrating the Jalur Gemilang or a foreign flag for a term of between five and fifteen years. She clarified that provisions for safeguarding the national flag would be added under the proposed National Harmony Act.

Nine Australian men, the &#x27;Budgie Nine&#x27;, were arrested after celebrating the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix by stripping to their &#x27;budgie smuggler&#x27; swimming trunks, decorated with the Malaysian flag. After three days in custody they were charged with public nuisance and released. The briefs had been made in Australia, not Malaysia.

In 2013, a group of Chinese Malaysian students in Taiwan, were photographed with an upside-down national flag, and claimed the action was &quot;to express their dissatisfaction of the just-concluded general election that they alleged was carried out in an undemocratic way&quot;. In another incident, a Chinese Malaysian businessman Lee Kim Yew was reported to have dishonoring the national flag by changing its white stripes to black in an online post. The image, which has since been removed, was uploaded along with a post by Lee highlighting his recent blog entry on the inclusion of Jawi script lessons in Malay-language textbooks for Year 4 students. His action drew widespread online criticism and Lee&#x27;s Facebook account appeared to have been deactivated later on.

===Mexico===
The use of the National Symbols (Coat of Arms, Anthem, and National Flag) in Mexico is protected by law. In Mexico, the desecration of the national flag and coat of arms is a crime punishable by six months to four years in prison, or a fine of 50 to 3,000 pesos (between 2 and 152 USD), or both sanctions. Although punishment is not sought often and are usually not harsh, there are a few instances; for example, in 2008 a federal judge convicted an individual for &#x27;desecrating the flag&#x27; in a poem. The ministry that oversees the use of national symbols requested four years in jail, but the judge only issued a small fine and a public warning.

===Nepal===
Burning the national flag is illegal in Nepal. The Criminal Code has a provision of a three-year jail sentence or a Rs 30,000 (about $300) fine or both if one is found disrespecting or damaging the national anthem or the national flag.

===Netherlands===
Flag desecration is not a crime according to the Dutch law. For example in Nova Scotia, Canada, the Dutch flag is used as an &quot;open&quot; and &quot;sale&quot; sign.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, under the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 it is illegal to destroy the New Zealand flag with the intent of dishonouring it. In 2003, Paul Hopkinson, a Wellington schoolteacher, burned the national flag of New Zealand as part of a protest in Parliament grounds at the New Zealand Government&#x27;s hosting of the Prime Minister of Australia, against the background of Australia&#x27;s support of the United States in the Iraq War. Hopkinson was initially convicted under Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 of destroying a New Zealand flag with intent to dishonour it, but appealed his conviction. On appeal, his conviction was overturned on the grounds that the law had to be read consistently with the right to freedom of expression under the Bill of Rights. This meant that his actions were not unlawful because the word dishonour in the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act had many shades of meaning, and when the least restrictive meaning of that word was adopted Hopkinson&#x27;s actions did not meet that standard. This somewhat unusual result was due in part to the fact that the Bill of Rights does not overrule other laws (&quot;Hopkinson v Police&quot;).

In 2007, activist Valerie Morse had burned the New Zealand flag during an ANZAC Day dawn service in Wellington. She was fined NZ$500 by the Wellington District Court and her conviction was upheld by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After Morse&#x27;s lawyers appealed the conviction on the grounds that she was being punished for expressing ideas, the New Zealand Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the previous rulings had misinterpreted the meaning of &quot;offensive behavior&quot; in the Summary Offences Act.

===Nigeria===
Any person who flies or exhibits the National Flag in a defaced or bad condition shall be guilty of an offence. A fine of and in the case of a continuing offence to a fine of for every day or part of a day during which the offence is continued after the day on which such person is first convicted. 

===North Macedonia===
The desecration of the national flag, coat of arms or anthem and international flags, coat of arms or anthems is banned under Articles 178 and 181 in the Criminal Code of North Macedonia.

It is questionable if these laws are enforced as there have been many instances where the national and foreign flags were set on fire.

===Norway===
Desecration of foreign countries&#x27; flags or national coats of arms was previously banned according to the General Civil Penal Code §95. The ban had, however, rarely been practiced, and was eventually lifted in 2008.

Comedian Otto Jespersen burned a U.S. flag during a satirical TV show in 2003.
During the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Norwegian flags were burned in demonstrations in various Muslim countries.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan&#x27;s flag comes under the strict protection of various constitutional clauses. However, the statutes governing the topic consist only of Pakistan Flag Protocols and are unclear as with regards to legal status of the offender and the punishment under the Pakistan Penal Code.

===Panama===
On 9 January 1964, a dispute broke out between Panamanian students and Americans living in the Panama Canal Zone over the right of the flag of Panama to be raised next to the flag of the United States, as the Canal Zone was then a disputed territory between the two nations. During the scuffle a Panamanian flag carried by Panamanian students was torn. This sparked four days of riots that ended with 22 Panamanians and four Americans dead and with Panama breaking diplomatic relations with the United States. This event is considered very important in the decision to negotiate and sign the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, by whose terms the Panama Canal administration was handed over to the Panamanian Government at the end of 1999. 9 January is known as Martyrs&#x27; Day and is commemorated in Panama as a day of mourning.

===Peru===
The precise law in Peru is unclear, but such acts are clearly capable of causing outrage. In 2008, the dancer, model and actress Leysi Suárez appeared naked photographed using Peru&#x27;s flag as a saddle while mounted on a horse. The country&#x27;s defence minister said she would face charges that could put her in jail for up to four years for offending patriotic symbols&quot;. However, the case was closed in 2010.

===Philippines===
Section 34a of the 1998 Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines declares that it is a prohibited act &quot;to mutilate, deface, defile, trample on or cast contempt or commit any act or omission casting dishonor or ridicule upon the flag or over its surface;&quot;

Section 50 meanwhile declares, &quot;Any person or judicial entity which violates any of the provisions of this Act shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than five thousand pesos (₱5,000.00) not more than twenty thousand pesos (₱20,000.00), or by imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both such fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the court: Provided, That for any second and additional offenses, both fine and imprisonment shall always be imposed: Provided, That in case the violation is committed by a juridical person, its President or Chief Executive Officer thereof shall be liable.&quot;

Flag burning is only permitted, in the case of proper disposal of the flag.

A crucial point of etiquette for the Philippine flag is that flying it upside-down (i.e., red field over blue), or vertically hanging it with the red to the viewer&#x27;s left, makes it the national war standard. Outside of an official state of war, Filipinos consider this a major &quot;faux-pas&quot; or a highly offensive act: several instances of this incorrect display (usually by foreigners) have attracted online backlash, prompting official apologies.

===Poland===
Polish Criminal Code (1997) declares:

Article 137. § 1. &quot;Whoever publicly insults, destroys, damages or removes an emblem, banner, standard, flag, ensign or other symbol of the State shall be subject to a fine, the penalty of restriction of liberty or the penalty of deprivation of liberty for up to one year.&quot; § 2. &quot;The same punishment shall be imposed on anyone, who on the territory of the Republic of Poland publicly insults, destroys, damages or removes an emblem, banner, standard, flag, ensign or other symbol of another State, publicly displayed by a mission of this State or upon an order of a Polish authority.&quot; Article 138. § 1. &quot;The provisions of Articles 136 and 137 § 2 shall apply, when the foreign country ensures reciprocity.&quot;

===Portugal===
Currently, according to article 332 of the Penal Code, &quot;Who publicly, by means of words, gestures or print publication, or by other means of public communication, insults the Republic, the Flag or the National Anthem, the coats of arms or the symbols of Portuguese sovereignty, or fails to show the respect they are entitled to, shall be punished with up to two years&#x27; imprisonment or a fine of up to 240 days&quot;. In the case of the regional symbols, the person shall be punished with up to one year&#x27;s imprisonment or a fine of up to 120 days (fines are calculated based on the defendant&#x27;s income).

The Portuguese Penal Code (article 323) also forbids the desecration of foreign symbols: &quot;Who publicly, by means of words, gestures or print publication, or by other means of public communication, insults the official flag or other symbol of sovereignty of a foreign State or of an international organization of which Portugal is a member shall be punished with up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to 120 days.&quot; This article applies under two conditions (article 324): that Portugal maintains diplomatic relations with the insulted country, and that there is reciprocity (i.e., that the insulted country would also punish any insult against Portuguese symbols of sovereignty, should they occur there).

===Romania===
The Romanian Criminal Code no longer prohibits flag desecration (as it was the case with the previous criminal code). Several laws attempting to reinstate punishments for manifestations which express contempt for the Romanian symbols (according to the constitution, these are the flag, national day, anthem and coat-of-arms) have not been approved.

During the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Communist era flag was flown with the coat of arms cut out, leaving a hole.

===Russia===
In February 2011, Japanese ultra-rightists held a protest over the Kuril Islands dispute outside of the Russian embassy in Tokyo, during which they dragged a Russian flag on the ground; Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov stated that his ministry had asked the Japanese government to launch a criminal case over the incident.

In 2013, the U.S. rock band Bloodhound Gang desecrated a Russian flag during a concert in Ukraine. In response, Vladimir Markin of the Investigative Committee of Russia said that his department was prepared to file criminal charges if prosecutors thought they had a case.

National flag burning is a crime in Russia, resulting in up to four years of imprisonment as punishment.

===Samoa===
Those who deface or wilfully insult the flag of Samoa can be imprisoned for up to six months.

===Saudi Arabia===
The flag of Saudi Arabia bears the &quot;shahada&quot; (Islamic declaration of faith). Because the &quot;shahada&quot; is considered holy, even the slightest disrespect amounts to not only desecration but blasphemy. This has led to several incidents of controversy. In 1994, McDonald&#x27;s printed carry-out bags bearing the flags of all nations participating in the FIFA World Cup (with a green flag with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s coat of arms superimposed, rather than the Saudi flag), while Coca-Cola did the same on cans of soda. Because of Saudi Arabian objections, the companies stopped producing those items. Also during the FIFA World Cup, in 2002, Saudi Arabian officials protested against printing the flag on a football on the belief that kicking the creed with the foot was unacceptable.

Because of the shahada, even flying this flag at half-mast is considered desecration in Saudi Arabia. This also applies to the flags of Afghanistan and Somaliland which also bear the shahada, and Iraq&#x27;s which bears the takbir.

===Serbia===
In Serbia, flag desecration is illegal.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, flag desecration is illegal under the statuory of National Symbols Act 2022 and National Symbols Regulations 2023. Under current constitution, using the national symbol (such as Presidential symbols, state crests, national flag, public seals and national flowers) in a derogatory manner (including defacing, dirtying and obstructing some symbols like stars and crescents) also amounts to flag descration, which enforces a stop-work order or a maximum penalty of S$30,000 or a six-month imprisonment or both (previously S$1,000).

===South Africa===
During the apartheid era, protesters would burn the (former) South African flag in protest against the apartheid policies of the South African government. In one example, Americans opposed to apartheid burned the old South African flag at an anti-apartheid protest in the U.S. state of Massachusetts during the mid-1980s. South Africans opposed to minority rule also burned the (now former) South African flag, viewing it as a symbol of the country&#x27;s government at the time. Under the 1983 constitution desecration of the flag was a criminal offense punishable by up to five years&#x27; imprisonment.

In post-apartheid South Africa there is no law banning flag desecration. The current South African flag designed and adopted in 1994 has been the subject of desecration. In early 1994, white supremacists from the &quot;Afrikaner Volksfront&quot; organization burned the then-new South African flag in Bloemfontein in protest against the country&#x27;s pending democratization.

===South Korea===
The South Korean &quot;Criminal Act&quot; punishes flag desecration, of both domestic and foreign, in various ways:

*Article 105 imposes up to three years in prison, disfranchisement of up to six years, or a fine up to four million South Korean won for damaging, removing, or staining a South Korean flag or emblem with intent to insult the South Korean state. Article 5 makes this crime punishable, even if done by aliens outside South Korea.
*Article 106 imposes up to one year in prison, disfranchisement of up to five years, or a fine up to two million South Korean won for defaming a South Korean flag or emblem with intent to insult the South Korean state. Article 5 makes this crime punishable, even if done by aliens outside South Korea.
*Article 109 imposes up to two years in prison or a fine up to three million South Korean won for damaging, removing, or staining a foreign flag or emblem with intent to insult a foreign country. Article 110 forbids prosecution without foreign governmental complaint.
The desecration of the national flag in South Korea by the country&#x27;s own citizens is rare when compared to analogous instances in other countries as the flag is viewed more along the lines of an ethnic flag rather than merely just the flag of a state.

===Soviet Union===
The flag of the Soviet Union was burned many times by protestors against its government&#x27;s policies, for instance in Brazil by those protesting the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia of 1968, and in New York City in 1985 by protesters against the Soviet–Afghan War. The Soviet flag was burned or otherwise desecrated during the Euromaidan in Ukraine.

===Spain===
The Spanish Penal Code punishes insulting the flag of Spain and the flags of the autonomous communities of Spain with a fine that can range from 420 to 144,000 euros. However, flag burning is often seen in nationalist demonstrations.

===Sweden===
In Swedish law, there is no explicit prohibition against burning the flag of any country. The desecration of the national flag was decriminalized in 1971. However, publicly showing a Swedish flag modified with added marks, characters or symbols is forbidden according flag law number 1982:269, and may be punishable under the provisions regarding disorderly conduct (&quot;förargelseväckande beteende&quot;) under the chapter 16 § 16 of the criminal code. 

In 1997 a teenager who identified as a skinhead was fined 500kr for waving a large, modified Swedish flag from the top of a hill during an event celebrating Sweden&#x27;s National Day. The motifs that had been added to the flag in question were those of a sun wheel, an axe, a viking warrior&#x27;s head in profile and the word &quot;Valhalla&quot;. The royal family being present, the event being part of the city of Lycksele&#x27;s 50 year jubilee, and the act of standing on the hill to increase the number of people who could see the flag, were all seen as contributing factors in the sentence.

===Switzerland===
The destruction, removal, or desecration of national emblems installed by a public authority (i.e., the Swiss flag, the Swiss coat of arms, the cantonal or municipal flags and coats of arms) results in a monetary penalty or a punishment of up to three years of imprisonment according to the Swiss federal penal code. The destruction or desecration of privately owned flags or coats of arms is legal.

===Taiwan===
Under Articles 118 and 160 of the Criminal Law of the Republic of China (Taiwan), it is a criminal offence to insult either the national flag or the national emblem of any country. If it is a national flag or emblem of a foreign country being insulted, the name of the offence would be &#x27;obstructing state diplomacy&#x27;; if it is the ones of the Republic of China (Taiwan), the offence would be &#x27;disturbing the order&#x27;. Besides, insulting or damaging the portrait of Sun Yat-sen is also punishable as &#x27;disturbing the order&#x27;. The penalty can be either incarceration for up to one year, or a fine of $9,000 NTD or less.

===Thailand===
In October 2018, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha ordered the Foreign Ministry to investigate fashion footwear in Paris that incorporates the colours of the Thai national flag. Photos of the shoes, shown on the &quot;Vogue Paris&quot; Facebook page taken during Paris Fashion Week, outraged Thai social media users, some of whom demanded apologies and jail sentences for the perpetrators. As was pointed out in the Bangkok daily, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The combination of the Thai flag and human feet is a contentious cultural cocktail for Thais.&quot;

The designers are immune from prosecution as the shoes were made and displayed outside Thailand. Were the offence committed in Thailand, those responsible could face a 2,000 baht fine or a year in jail.

A spokesman at the Thai National Flag Museum commented that no one has a copyright on the flag&#x27;s colours or the order in which they are presented.

===Turkey===

Under the 1983 Turkish flag law, burning the flag is strictly forbidden, resulting in a prison sentence of three years. Displaying or pulling a torn or discolored flag to flagpole is also illegal. Taking down the flag is a crime, which results in a prison sentence of 18 years.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, the desecration of national symbols, including the national flag, is a crime, resulting in up to one year of imprisonment as punishment.

===United Kingdom===

The law of England and Wales and the law of Scotland have no specific concept of &quot;flag desecration&quot;. Flag desecration is not illegal in the United Kingdom.

In May 1998, in a protest by 2,000 former prisoners of war, a Burma Railway veteran torched the Rising Sun banner before both Emperor Akihito and Queen Elizabeth. Police were persuaded by the crowd not to arrest him. A year later, two &quot;committed socialists&quot; threw a burning British flag in the direction of the Queen&#x27;s motor vehicle. They were arrested for a breach of the peace offence, subsequently pleaded guilty and were fined a total of £450. In 2001 at RAF Feltwell, home of United States Air Force&#x27;s 5th Space Surveillance Squadron, a protester desecrated a U.S. flag with the words &quot;Stop Star Wars&quot; before stepping in front of a vehicle and stomping on the flag. Her conviction under S5 Public Order Act 1986 was overturned as incompatible with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In 2011, a group of approximately 20–30 students at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge influenced the burning of a large British flag, the centerpiece of the Student Union&#x27;s decorations to celebrate the royal wedding. King&#x27;s College Student Union condemned the action as a &quot;needlessly divisive and violent way to make a political point... [the] Union flag is a symbol and therefore can mean different things to different people in different contexts.&quot;

The Union Flag has also been burned by Argentine nationalists protesting British sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.

In 2006, to allow greater police control over extremist protesters, 17 MPs signed a House of Commons motion calling for burning of the British flag to be made a criminal offence.

====Northern Ireland====

Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, the law in Northern Ireland has varied since its foundation in 1921. The British flag, the former flag of Northern Ireland, and the Irish flag are often desecrated or burnt in Northern Ireland by various groups as a political statement/provocation or in protest.

Also in Northern Ireland, Ulster loyalists have sometimes mistakenly desecrated the Ivorian flag, erroneously mistaking it for the Irish one as the two are somewhat similar in appearance. In some cases, Ivorian flags displayed in Northern Ireland have signs explicitly labeling them as such displayed nearby to avoid having them desecrated by Ulster loyalists mistaking them for Irish ones.

===United States===
Flag desecration is not a crime in the United States. The flag of the United States is sometimes burned as a cultural or political statement, in protest of the policies of the U.S. government, or for other reasons, both within the U.S. and abroad. The United States Supreme Court in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, , and reaffirmed in &quot;U.S. v. Eichman&quot;, , has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipal) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as &quot;symbolic speech.&quot; However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression. If the flag that was burned was someone else&#x27;s property (as it was in the &quot;Johnson&quot; case, since Johnson had stolen the flag from a Texas bank&#x27;s flagpole), the offender could be charged with petty larceny (a flag usually sells at retail for less than US$20), or with destruction of private property, or possibly both. Desecration of a flag representing a minority group may also be used in some jurisdictions to support the prosecution of a crime as a hate crime.

In the American Civil War, the U.S. flag was flown by the Union against the Confederacy. Union Army general Benjamin Franklin Butler ordered the 1862 execution for treason of William B. Mumford, who had removed a Union flag in occupied New Orleans. An apocryphal tale of Barbara Fritchie preventing Confederate soldiers dishonoring her Union flag was propagated by John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s 1863 poem &quot;&quot;, which contains the famous lines:
&quot;Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country&#x27;s flag,&quot; she said.

During the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War, American flags were sometimes burned during war protest demonstrations.

After the &quot;Johnson&quot; decision, the Flag Protection Act was passed, protecting flags from anyone who &quot;mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag&quot;. This law was later struck down in the &quot;Eichman&quot; decision. After that case, several flag burning amendments to the Constitution were proposed. On June 22, 2005, a Flag Desecration Amendment was passed by the House with the needed two-thirds majority. On June 27, 2006, another attempt to pass a ban on flag burning was rejected by the Senate in a close vote of 66 in favor and 34 opposed, one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to send the amendment to be voted on by the states.

There have been several proposed Flag Desecration Amendments to the Constitution of the United States that would allow Congress to enact laws to prohibit flag desecration:
*Douglas Applegate (Ohio) in 1991
*Spencer Bachus (Alabama) in 2013
*Steve Daines (Montana) in 2019
*Robert Dornan (California) in 1991
*Bill Emerson (Missouri) in 1991, 1993, 1995
*Randy Cunningham (California) in 1999, 2001, 2003,
*Jo Ann Emerson (Missouri) in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013
*John P. Hammerschmidt (Arkansas), 1991
*Orrin Hatch (Utah) in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2011, 2013
*Andrew Jacobs Jr. (Indiana) in 1995
*Joseph M. McDade (Pennsylvania) in 1989, 1995, 1996
*Clarence E. Miller (Ohio) in 1991
*John Murtha (Pennsylvania) in 2007
*Ron Paul (Texas) in 1997, but he opposed any federal prohibition of flag desecration, including his own Flag Desecration Amendment which he proposed only as a protest against proposals by his Congressional colleagues, such as Emerson and Solomon, to ban flag desecration through ordinary legislation instead of by Constitutional Amendment.
*Gerald B. H. Solomon (New York) in 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997
*Floyd Spence (South Carolina) in 1991
*David Vitter (Louisiana) in 2009

During a rally in June 2020, president Donald Trump told supporters that he believed flag burning should be punishable by one year in prison.

====Flag burning====

In common usage, the phrase &quot;flag burning&quot; refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest. However, the United States Flag Code states that &quot;the flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display (for example, the flag being faded or torn), should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.&quot;

====Confederate flag====
The Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, commonly referred to as the Confederate flag, has sometimes been burned in protest as well. In 2000, protesters from the Jewish Defense League burned Confederate and Nazi flags to protest an arson attempt against a Reno, Nevada synagogue. This was criticized by a representative of the Anti-Defamation League, who said that it was more effective to work with the police and other authorities rather than to engage in &quot;tactics which inflame and exacerbate situations.&quot;

Of the states which continue to have laws against flag burning, in spite of them being ruled unconstitutional, five afford this protection to the Virginian battle flag as well: Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.

===Uruguay===
Desecration of foreign national flags is punished by the article 139 of the Penal Code:Article 139 (Disrespect of foreign emblems) Whoever, in the territory of the State, disrespects, in a public place or in a place open or exposed to the public, the flag or any other emblem of a foreign State, shall be punished with six months of imprisonment to three years of penitentiary.There is no restriction in place for the desecration of the Uruguayan national flag.

=== Uzbekistan ===
In Uzbekistan, desecration of state symbols, including the national flag of Uzbekistan or Karakalpakstan, emblem, or anthem, is punishable under Article 215 of the Criminal Code with fines, community service, or correctional labor for up to three years. Additionally, Article 203 of the Administrative Code imposes fines for violating legislation on state symbols, with stricter penalties for repeat offenses.

===Venezuela===
Since the demonstrations against the refusal by the government to renew the broadcasting license of RCTV (a major TV network), the upside-down flag of Venezuela has been adopted as a symbol of protest for this and other alleged threats to civil liberties. Demonstrators claim that it is a sign of distress and a call for help. However, government and ruling-party officials insist that these demonstrators are desecrating the flag. An official video sharply criticizing this practice as disrespectful was produced. Globovisión prepended to the video a statement denouncing the message as violative of the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television, &quot;for constituting anonymous official propaganda&quot;.

<doc id="536875" wikidata="Q6673403" url="?curid=536875" title="Long Wharf (New Haven)">
<text>Long Wharf is a waterfront district and neighborhood of the city of New Haven, Connecticut, United States. The neighborhood is a mixed-use district, with a combination of commercial, industrial, port, and recreation facilities.

==Location==
Long Wharf can be defined as the area stretching inland from the west side of New Haven Harbor northwest to Union Avenue, west to Hallock Avenue and Cedar Street, and north to the Oak Street Connector and I-95 (up to the Q-Bridge). It is located east of The Hill, and south of downtown New Haven and the Wooster Square neighborhood. Interstate 95 bisects the neighborhood from the southwest to northeast; it intersects with Interstate 91 in the extreme northeast section of the neighborhood. The Oak Street Connector/Route 34 also connects with Interstate 95 in the selfsame section.

==History==
The area is called &quot;Long Wharf&quot; because there was once a wharf there that projected out of the juncture of Water St. and Union Ave. The wharf was built by William Lanson, an African American entrepreneur and engineer. He built the wharf into New Haven Harbor until it finally reached a length of 3/4 of a mile, making it the longest wharf in the country. Along it stood the Customs House, warehouses and other businesses. It was destroyed in the late 1940s to early 1950s when the harbor was partially filled in to construct Interstate Highways 91 and 95, dramatically moving the waterfront and creating this district.

==Buildings and features==

The Long Wharf area contains several notable features and buildings, including the Long Wharf Theatre, the Long Wharf Maritime Center, Sargent (a New Haven firm with a history going back to 1810, now a division of Assa Abloy), the former headquarters of the &quot;New Haven Register&quot; (Jordan&#x27;s Furniture as of 2016), as well as New Haven&#x27;s &quot;Vietnam Veterans Memorial Park&quot; which stretches for seventeen acres (69,000 m2) directly along the harborfront. Long Wharf is also the home port of a replica of the historical ship Amistad.

The area also includes the remaining portion of Marcel Breuer&#x27;s landmark Pirelli Tire Building (1969), now the Hotel Marcel. The building was truncated in 2003 to accommodate the construction of the new IKEA home products store. IKEA originally proposed to destroy the entire building but compromised after a lengthy public debate. The tower was preserved but the rear portion was razed to make room for the IKEA parking lot. Ironically, IKEA&#x27;s furniture styling is strongly influenced by the famed Bauhaus school where Breuer taught. It was once planned that a large shopping mall, the New Haven Galleria, would be constructed at this location; instead the IKEA store was built.

==Church Street Bridge==
Road construction has been encouraged to reconnect this neighborhood directly with downtown. The Church Street Bridge was built for this purpose and opened in December 2003. It provided a new link from downtown to Long Wharf for vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists. Constructing the bridge was difficult due to its placement over a broad active rail yard. In order to minimize disruption, particularly to the trains which run underneath it, the bridge was completed in a single-night operation (called the &quot;Big Pick&quot;) using the largest land-based, mobile, high-capacity crane in existence. This mega-crane with a 2600-ton capacity was delivered in over 200 tractor-trailer loads and put in place the preassembled steel truss center span.

==Neighborhood issues==
Long Wharf Drive has attracted drag racers from all over the state. On August 17, 2008, Misael Ruiz, of East Haven, was killed by a racing car that lost control. Town officials are now making decisions on how to prevent racing on the strip.

<text>David William Sanborn (July 30, 1945 – May 12, 2024) was an American alto saxophonist. He worked in many musical genres; his solo recordings typically blended jazz with instrumental pop and R&amp;B. He began playing the saxophone at the age of 11 and released his first solo album, &quot;Taking Off,&quot; in 1975. He was active as a session musician and played on numerous albums by artists including Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin, Sting, the Eagles, Rickie Lee Jones, James Brown, George Benson, Carly Simon, Elton John, Bryan Ferry, and The Rolling Stones. Sanborn released more than 20 albums and won six Grammy awards.

Sanborn was one of the most commercially successful American saxophonists to earn prominence since the 1980s. He was described by critic Scott Yanow as &quot;the most influential saxophonist on pop, R&amp;B and crossover players of the past 20 years.&quot; He became identified with radio-friendly smooth jazz, although he disliked the term and said he was not a jazz musician.

==Early life==
Sanborn was born in 1945 in Tampa, Florida where his father was stationed in the US Air Force. David grew up in Kirkwood, Missouri, a western suburb of St Louis He contracted polio at the age of three. He &quot;accepted his fate stoically&quot; and endured a &quot;miserable childhood&quot;. He was confined to an iron lung for a year, and polio left him with impaired respiration and a left arm shorter than the right.

While confined to bed, David Sanborn was inspired by the &quot;raw rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll energy&quot; of music he heard on the radio, particularly saxophone breaks in songs such as Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; and Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;. He loved the sound of the saxophone and at the age of eleven was happy to change to saxophone from piano lessons when doctors recommended that he take up a wind instrument to improve his breathing and strengthen his chest muscles. When he was 14, he was competent enough playing saxophone to play with blues musicians in local clubs. Alto saxophonist Hank Crawford, who was a member of Ray Charles&#x27;s band at the time, was an early and lasting influence on Sanborn.

Sanborn attended college at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois directly north of Chicago and studied music. He transferred to the University of Iowa in Iowa City east of Des Moines where he played and studied with saxophonist J. R. Monterose.

==Career==
Sanborn performed with blues musicians Albert King and Little Milton at the age of 14. In 1967 Sanborn took a Greyhound bus to San Francisco to join the &quot;Summer of Love.&quot; While visiting recording studios he was invited to sit in on a session with The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. He made such an impression that he joined the band for five years. He recorded on four Butterfield albums as a horn section member and a soloist from 1967 to 1971. Early in the morning on August 18, 1969, he appeared with the band at the Woodstock Music Festival in Bethel, New York.

In 1972, Sanborn played on the track &quot;Tuesday Heartbreak&quot; on the Stevie Wonder album &quot;Talking Book&quot;. In 1975 he worked with David Bowie on &quot;Young Americans&quot; and on the James Taylor recording of &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)&quot; on the album &quot;Gorilla&quot;. In the mid-1970s, Sanborn became active in the popular jazz fusion scene by joining the Brecker Brothers band, where he became influenced by Michael Brecker. With the Brecker brothers he recorded his first solo album, &quot;Taking Off&quot;, which became a jazz/funk classic. In 1985, Sanborn and Al Jarreau played two sold-out concerts at Chastain Park in Atlanta. Although Sanborn was most associated with smooth jazz, he studied free jazz in his youth with saxophonists Roscoe Mitchell and Julius Hemphill. In 1993, he revisited this genre when he appeared on Tim Berne&#x27;s &quot;Diminutive Mysteries&quot;, dedicated to Hemphill. Sanborn&#x27;s album &quot;Another Hand&quot; which featured avant-garde musicians.

===Recordings===
Sanborn was a highly regarded session player from the late 1960s onwards and played with an array of well-known artists including James Brown, Phil Woods, Bryan Ferry, Michael Stanley, Eric Clapton, Bobby Charles, Cat Stevens, Roger Daltrey, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Jaco Pastorius, the Brecker Brothers, Michael Franks, Kenny Loggins, Casiopea, Players Association, David Bowie, Todd Rundgren, Bruce Springsteen, Little Feat, Tommy Bolin, Bob James, James Taylor, Al Jarreau, Pure Prairie League, Kenny G, Loudon Wainwright III, George Benson, Joe Beck, Donny Hathaway, Elton John, Gil Evans, Carly Simon, Guru, Linda Ronstadt, Billy Joel, Kenny Garrett, Roger Waters, Steely Dan, Ween, the Eagles, Grateful Dead, Nena, Hikaru Utada, The Rolling Stones, Ian Hunter, and Toto.

Many of Sanborn&#x27;s solo recordings were collaborations with bassist/multi-instrumentalist/composer and producer Marcus Miller, whom he met in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band in the late 1970s. Sanborn performed with Clapton on film soundtracks such as &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (and its sequels) and &quot;Scrooged&quot;. In 1991, Sanborn recorded &quot;Another Hand&quot;, which the &quot;All Music Guide to Jazz&quot; described as a &quot;return by Sanborn to his real, true love: unadorned (or only partly adorned) jazz&quot; that &quot;balanced the scales&quot; against his smooth jazz material. The album, produced by Hal Willner, featured musicians from outside the smooth jazz scene like Terry Adams, Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Frisell, and Marc Ribot.

In 1994, Sanborn appeared in &quot;A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who&quot;, also known as &quot;Daltrey Sings Townshend,&quot; a two-night concert at Carnegie Hall produced by Roger Daltrey of English rock band The Who in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. In 1994 a CD and a VHS video were issued, and in 1998 a DVD was released. In 1995 Sanborn performed in &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot;, a musical performance at Lincoln Center to benefit the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. The performance was broadcast on Turner Network Television (TNT) and released on CD and video in 1996.

In 2006, he featured in Gordon Goodwin&#x27;s Big Phat Band&#x27;s album &quot;The Phat Pack&quot; on the track &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;, a remake of the Wild Cherry hit in a big band style. Sanborn often performed at Japan&#x27;s Blue Note venues in Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo. Sanborn played on the song &quot;Your Party&quot; on Ween&#x27;s 2007 release &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;. On April 8, 2007, he sat in with the Allman Brothers Band during their annual run at the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan, New York. In 2010, Sanborn toured with a trio featuring jazz organist Joey DeFrancesco and Steve Gadd. They played the combination of blues and jazz from his album &quot;Only Everything&quot;. In 2011, Sanborn toured with keyboardist George Duke and bassist Marcus Miller as the group DMS. In 2013, Sanborn toured with keyboardist Brian Culbertson on &quot;The Dream Tour&quot; celebrating the 25th anniversary of the song &quot;The Dream&quot;.

Beginning in the late 1980s he was a regular guest member of Paul Shaffer&#x27;s band on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. He also appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; a few times in the 1990s.

From 1988 to 1989, Sanborn co-hosted &quot;Night Music&quot;, a late-night music show on television with Jools Holland.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Sanborn hosted a syndicated radio program, &quot;The Jazz Show with David Sanborn&quot;. He recorded many shows&#x27; theme songs, as well as several other songs for &quot;The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder&quot;. In 2021, as the coronavirus pandemic paused live music performances in public venues, Sanborn hosted a series of master classes on Zoom and also virtual productions of &quot;Sanborn Sessions&quot; with artists such as Marcus Miller, Christian McBride, Sting, Michael McDonald, which involved live performances and interviews from his home in Westchester, New York.

==Equipment==
Sanborn played a Selmer Mark VI alto saxophone. In the early 1980s he was endorsed by Yamaha and he played their saxophones on the albums &quot;As We Speak&quot; and &quot;Backstreet.&quot; He can be seen playing a Yamaha saxophone at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1981.

According to an April 1988 interview in the jazz magazine &quot;DownBeat&quot;, he had a preference for Selmer Mark VI alto saxophones in the 140,000-150,000 serial number range, all produced in 1967. From the late 1970s, Sanborn played with mouthpieces created by Bobby Dukoff. He later played a mouthpiece designed by Aaron Drake.

Sanborn was married to his fourth wife, French-born Alice Soyer Sanborn, a pianist, vocalist, and composer. His first three marriages ended in divorce. He had one son, Jonathan, a bass player and two granddaughters.

Sanborn died of complications from prostate cancer in Tarrytown, New York west of White Plains, on May 12, 2024, at the age of 78. He was diagnosed with the disease in 2018.

On November 25, 2024, a David Sanborn Tribute Concert was held at Sony Hall in New York City. The concert was live-streamed by WBGO and hosted by Marcus Miller and Pat Prescott, and featured performances by Eric Marienthal, Bob James, Paul Shaffer, Will Lee, Kurt Elling, Randy Brecker, Alex Han and Dave Koz.

==Awards and honors==

<doc id="536880" wikidata="Q472051" url="?curid=536880" title="Glenn Frey">
<text>Glenn Lewis Frey (; November 6, 1948 – January 18, 2016) was an American musician. He was a founding member of the rock band Eagles, for whom he was the co-lead singer and frontman, roles he came to share with fellow member Don Henley, with whom he wrote most of Eagles&#x27; material. Frey played guitar and keyboards as well as singing lead vocals on songs such as &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;James Dean&quot;, &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, and &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;.

While Eagles were on hiatus from 1980 to 1994, Frey embarked on a successful solo career. He released his debut album, &quot;No Fun Aloud&quot;, in 1982 and went on to record Top 40 hits &quot;The One You Love&quot;, &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;, &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, &quot;You Belong to the City&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Soul Searchin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; Right&quot;. As a member of Eagles, Frey won six Grammy Awards and five American Music Awards. Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, the first year they were nominated. Consolidating his solo recordings and those with the Eagles, Frey had 24 Top 40 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early life==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, on November 6, 1948 and raised in nearby Royal Oak, Frey studied piano at age five, later switched to guitar, and became part of the mid-1960s Detroit rock scene. One of his earliest bands was called the Subterraneans, named after Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel, and included fellow Dondero High School classmates Doug Edwards (later replaced by Lenny Mintz) on drums, Doug Gunsch and Bill Barnes on guitar, with Jeff Hodge on bass.

Immediately after graduating from Dondero in 1966, Frey was invited to join The Four of Us, a local band led by Gary Burrows, who had seen him performing with the Subterraneans. Frey also attended Oakland Community College while in the band, and he learned to sing harmonies performing with The Four of Us. In 1967, he formed the Mushrooms with Gary Burrows&#x27; brother Jeff, Bill Barnes, Doug Gunsch, Ken Bash, and Lenny Mintz. That year Frey also met Bob Seger, who helped Frey get a management and recording contract with a label formed by Seger&#x27;s management team, Hideout Records. Seger also wrote and produced the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Such a Lovely Child&quot;, and the band made television appearances to promote it. Frey had intended to join Seger&#x27;s band, but his mother blocked that course of action for smoking cannabis with Seger. In the later part of 1967, Frey also pulled together another band called Heavy Metal Kids with Jeff Burrows (piano), Jeff Alborell (bass), Paul Kelcourse (lead guitar), and Lance Dickerson (drums).

At age 19 in 1968, Frey played the acoustic guitar and performed background vocals on Seger&#x27;s single, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;. Frey has said that Seger strongly encouraged and influenced him to focus on writing original songs. They remained good friends and occasional songwriting partners in later years, and Frey would also sing on Seger&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Fire Lake&quot; and &quot;Against the Wind&quot;.

In Detroit, Frey also met and dated Joan Sliwin of the local female group The Mama Cats, which became Honey Ltd. after the group moved to California in 1968. Frey went to Los Angeles hoping to reconnect with his girlfriend, and he was introduced to JD Souther by her sister, Alexandra Sliwin, who was with Souther at the time. Frey returned to Detroit after three weeks, but then went back again to Los Angeles to form a duo with Souther called Longbranch Pennywhistle. They were signed to Amos Records and released an eponymous album in 1969, which contains songs he wrote such as &quot;Run, Boy, Run&quot; and &quot;Rebecca&quot;, and &quot;Bring Back Funky Women&quot; he co-wrote with Souther. Frey also met Jackson Browne during this period. The three musicians lived in the same apartment building for a short time, and Frey later said that he learned a lot about songwriting from hearing Browne work on songs in the apartment below.

==Eagles==
Frey met drummer Don Henley in 1970. They were signed to the same label, Amos Records, at that time and spent time at the Troubadour. When Linda Ronstadt needed a backup band for an upcoming tour, her manager John Boylan hired Frey because Boylan needed someone who could play rhythm guitar and sing. Frey approached Don Henley to join Ronstadt. Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon were also hired. Because the backing band personnel changed during the tour, the four played together only once: at a gig at Disneyland. While on the tour, Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and were joined by Meisner on bass and Leadon on guitar, banjo, steel guitar, mandolin, and dobro, forming the Eagles, with Frey playing guitar and keyboards and Henley playing drums. The band went on to become one of the world&#x27;s bestselling groups of all time. Frey wrote or co-wrote (often with Henley) many of the group&#x27;s songs, and sang the lead vocals on a number of Eagles hits including &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; and &quot;How Long&quot;.

The Eagles broke up around 1980 and reunited in 1994, when they released a new album, &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;. The album had live tracks and four new songs. The Hell Freezes Over Tour followed. In 2012 on &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot;, Frey told Smiley, &quot;When the Eagles broke up, people used to ask me and Don, &#x27;When are the Eagles getting back together?&#x27; We used to answer, &#x27;When Hell freezes over.&#x27; We thought it was a pretty good joke. People have the misconception that we were fighting a lot. It is not true. We had a lot of fun. We had a lot more fun than I think people realize.&quot; At their first live concert of 1994, Frey told the crowd, &quot;For the record, we never broke up. We just took a 14-year vacation.&quot;

The Eagles released the album &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; in 2007, and Frey participated in the Eagles&#x27; Long Road Out of Eden Tour (2008–2011).

In May 2012, Frey was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music along with Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit.

In 2013, the two-part documentary &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;, directed by Alison Ellwood and co-produced by Academy Award winner Alex Gibney, was aired on Showtime. The documentary won an Emmy Award in 2013 for Outstanding Sound Mixing For Nonfiction Programming. An accompanying two-year History of the Eagles world tour ended on July 29, 2015, at Bossier City, Louisiana, a concert which would be Frey&#x27;s final public appearance with the band.

==Solo career==
After the Eagles disbanded, Frey achieved solo success in the 1980s, especially with two No. 2 hits. In 1984 he recorded in collaboration with Harold Faltermeyer the worldwide hit &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, the main theme from the Eddie Murphy action comedy film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;; then, Frey performed &quot;You Belong to the City&quot; (from the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, the soundtrack of which stayed on top of the U.S. album charts for 11 weeks in 1985). His other contribution to the soundtrack, &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, hit No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. During his solo career, Frey had 12 charting songs in the U.S. Top 100. Eleven of those were written with Jack Tempchin, who wrote &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;.

Frey was the first choice to record &quot;Shakedown&quot;, the theme for the film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;. Frey did not like the lyrics and then came down with laryngitis, so the song was given to Bob Seger. After the song went to number one, Frey called to congratulate Seger, saying &quot;At least we kept the money in Michigan!&quot;

Frey contributed the song &quot;Flip City&quot; to the &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; soundtrack and &quot;Part of Me, Part of You&quot; to the soundtrack for &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. In 2005 he appeared on &quot;B.B. King &amp; Friends: 80&quot; on the track &quot;Drivin&#x27; Wheel&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Frey founded a record company, Mission Records, with attorney Peter Lopez. Frey never released any of his own work on the label, and the company has since disbanded.

In 2009 Glenn Frey was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

On May 8, 2012, he released his first solo album in 20 years, &quot;After Hours&quot;, featuring covers of pop standards from the 1940s to the 1960s. It was his final album before his death.

==Acting career==
As a television actor, Frey guest starred on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in the first-season episode &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, inspired by his hit song of the same name, and had a starring role in the &quot;Dead Dog Records Arc&quot; of &quot;Wiseguy&quot;. He was also the star of &quot;South of Sunset&quot;, which was canceled after one episode. In the late 1990s, he guest-starred on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; as a policeman whose teenage daughter had run amok and gone on a crime spree with her sociopathic boyfriend. In 2002, he appeared on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Arliss&quot;, playing a political candidate who double-crosses Arliss and must pay a high price for it.

Frey&#x27;s first foray into film was his starring role in &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Harry&quot;, a 1986 film about a group of plumbers who travel to Colombia to rescue a friend from a drug lord. Frey&#x27;s next film appearance was a smaller role in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s third film, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). Frey played the frugal general manager of the Arizona Cardinals football team who, in the film&#x27;s climax, finally agrees to award Cuba Gooding Jr.&#x27;s character, wide receiver Rod Tidwell, a large professional contract.
==Personal life==
Frey was married twice. From 1983 to 1988, he was married to artist Janie Beggs. He married dancer and choreographer Cindy Millican in 1990. They had three children: a daughter, Taylor, in 1991 and two sons, Deacon in 1993 and Otis in 2002, and remained together until his death. Deacon, following his father&#x27;s death, toured with the surviving Eagles until he departed in 2022 in favor of a solo career. He rejoined the Eagles in 2023.

==Illness and death==
Frey was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2000, which affected his joints. The medication that he was prescribed to control the disease eventually led to colitis and pneumonia. In November 2015, the Eagles announced they were postponing their appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors because Frey required surgery for intestinal problems and needed a lengthy recovery period. Because of complications from pneumonia, he never had the surgery and was placed in a medically induced coma at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Frey died there on January 18, 2016, at the age of 67, from complications of rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis, and pneumonia. Some medications for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis are immune suppressants and can compromise the immune system&#x27;s ability to fight off pneumonia. In January 2018, Frey&#x27;s widow filed a suit against Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan) and gastroenterologist Steven Itzkowitz for the wrongful death of Frey.

Frey was publicly mourned by his friends, fellow musicians, and bandmates, including Don Henley, Randy Meisner, JD Souther, Jack Tempchin, Irving Azoff, Linda Ronstadt, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, and Bob Seger. A life-sized statue of Frey was unveiled at the Standin&#x27; on the Corner Park in Winslow, Arizona, on September 24, 2016, to honor his songwriting contributions to &quot;Take It Easy&quot;. The song was the Eagles&#x27; first single in 1972, with Frey its lead vocalist. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, the remaining members of the Eagles and Jackson Browne performed &quot;Take It Easy&quot; in his honor. The road running next to the high school (now a middle school) that Frey attended in Royal Oak, Michigan also bears his name.

Takamine Guitars manufactures a Glenn Frey signature acoustic-electric guitar, the EF360GF. It is designed to replicate the Takamine Frey used for his live and studio applications. In the 1970s, Frey used Martin acoustic guitars in both six- and 12-string versions.

Frey played assorted electric guitars over the years, namely Fender Telecaster, Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, Gibson ES-330, Epiphone Casino and Rickenbacker 230, but the electric guitar that is most associated with him was his black Gibson Les Paul Junior, nicknamed Old Black.

<text>Lynda Joy La Plante, CBE (née Titchmarsh; born 15 March 1943) is an English author, screenwriter and former actress often known for writing the &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; television crime series. In 2024 she was honoured with the Crime Writers&#x27; Association of Britain&#x27;s Diamond Dagger award for her outstanding lifetime&#x27;s contribution to the crime and mystery fiction genre.

== Early life ==
Lynda La Plante was born Lynda Joy Titchmarsh on 15 March 1943 in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire. La Plante&#x27;s older sister Dail was killed in a road accident, at the age of five, before she was born. Her younger sister, Gill Titchmarsh is a casting director, and the two have often worked together. They also had a brother who was a doctor.

Raised in Crosby, Liverpool, La Plante trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After finishing her studies, using the stage name Lynda Marchal, she appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company in a variety of productions, as well as popular television series including &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Educating Marmalade&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;The Professionals&quot;, and &quot;Bergerac&quot;. As an actress she is perhaps best remembered as the hay-fever suffering ghost Tamara Novek in the BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;Rentaghost&quot;. In 1974, La Plante took her first scriptwriting job on the ITV children&#x27;s series &quot;The Kids from 47A&quot;.

== &quot;Widows&quot; and career breakthrough ==
Her breakthrough came in 1983 when she created and wrote the six-part robbery series &quot;Widows&quot; for Thames Television. The plot concerned the widows of four armed robbers carrying out a heist planned by their deceased husbands. A second series of &quot;Widows&quot; followed in 1985, while a sequel &quot;She&#x27;s Out&quot; took up the story ten years later.

Her debut novel, &quot;The Legacy&quot;, was published in 1987 and received both critical and best-seller success. Her second, third and fourth novels came soon after – &quot;The Talisman&quot; (1987), &quot;Bella Mafia&quot; (1990) and &quot;Entwined&quot; (1993) – all of which became international best sellers.
In 1990 La Plante started working on her next television project, &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;, which was released by Granada Television in 1991. &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; starred Helen Mirren as DCI Jane Tennison, airing in the UK as well as on PBS in the United States as part of the anthology program &quot;Mystery!&quot;. In 1993 La Plante won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for her work on the series. In 1992 she wrote a TV film called &quot;Seekers&quot;, starring Brenda Fricker and Josette Simon, produced by Sarah Lawson.

In 1993 La Plante formed her own television production company, La Plante Productions and through her new company she wrote and produced high-rating series &quot;The Governor&quot; (ITV 1995–96), &quot;Supply &amp; Demand&quot; (ITV 1997–98), &quot;Killer Net&quot; (Channel 4 1998), acclaimed series &quot;Trial &amp; Retribution&quot; (ITV 1997–2009), &quot;Mind Games&quot; (ITV 2001) and &quot;The Commander&quot; (ITV 2003–08). During this period La Plante also released the Cold series of books; &quot;Cold Shoulder&quot;, &quot;Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;Cold Heart&quot;, followed by &quot;Sleeping Cruelty&quot; (2000) – adding to her list of best sellers.

In 1996 La Plante co-wrote and executive produced &quot;The Prosecutors&quot; (NBC) with Tom Fontana (starring Stockard Channing), wrote and executive produced &quot;Bella Mafia&quot; (1998 CBS) (starring Vanessa Redgrave), which La Plante adapted from her novel of the same name. In 2001 she co-produced &quot;The Warden&quot; (2001 TNT), starring Ally Sheedy, a variation of La Plante&#x27;s series &quot;The Governor&quot;. La Plante also co-produced her adaptation of the UK hit &quot;Widows&quot; (2002 ABC) and produced the pilot of &quot;Cold Shoulder&quot; (2006 New Regency / CBS) starring Kelly McGillis, which was based on her Cold series. La Plante was also executive producer on Daniel Petrie Jr&#x27;s adaptation of her show &quot;Framed&quot; (2002 TNT) which starred Sam Neill and Rob Lowe.

La Plante released &quot;Royal Flush&quot; (2002), and then began working on her Anna Travis series, which includes &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; (2004), &quot;The Red Dahlia&quot; (2005), &quot;Clean Cut&quot; (2007), &quot;Deadly Intent&quot; (2008), &quot;Silent Scream&quot; (2009), &quot;Blind Fury&quot; (2010), &quot;Blood Line&quot; (2011), &quot;Backlash&quot; (2012), and &quot;Wrongful Death&quot; (2013). So successful were the books that a UK television series was written and produced by La Plante starring Kelly Reilly and Ciarán Hinds.

&quot;Widows&quot; was remade as a US-set film in 2018, directed by Steve McQueen. &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; was also remade as an American series, starring Maria Bello. It ran for 13 episodes in 2011–2012.

==Awards==

La Plante has received many awards over the course of her career. For her work on &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; she received two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Mini Series (1993, 1994), as well as the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Mystery TV Episode. In 2001, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) gave her the Dennis Potter Award for television writing.

In 2008 La Plante was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List for services to Literature, Drama and to Charity. In the same year she received the TV Spielfilm Award at the International Film and Television Festival Conference in Cologne, Germany, for her television adaptation of her novel &quot;Above Suspicion&quot;.

In 2009 La Plante was inducted into the Crime Thriller Awards Hall of Fame and most recently, in 2013, La Plante was awarded an honorary fellowship with the Forensic Science Society (FSSoc), the first non-scientist to be inducted into the professional body; receiving the award for the accuracy with which she portrays forensic science in her work.

<doc id="536882" wikidata="Q1086358" url="?curid=536882" title="St. Rumbold's Cathedral">
<text>St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral (; ) is the Roman Catholic metropolitan archiepiscopal cathedral in Mechelen, Belgium, dedicated to Saint Rumbold, Christian missionary and martyr who founded an abbey nearby. His remains are rumoured to be buried inside the cathedral. State-of-the-art examination of the relics honoured as Saint Rumbold&#x27;s and kept in a shrine in the retro-choir, showed a life span of about 40 years and a death date between 580 and 655, while tradition had claimed 775 AD.

In 1999, the tower of the cathedral was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, in recognition of its architecture and its importance in civic duties such as a watchtower.

==History==

===Construction===
Construction of the church itself started shortly after 1200, and it was consecrated in 1312, when part had become usable. From 1324 onwards the flying buttresses and revised choir structure acquired Brabantine Gothic characteristics, distinct from French Gothic. After the city fire of 1342, the Master Mason Jean d&#x27;Oisy managed repairs and continued this second phase, which by the time of his death in 1375 formed the prototype for that High Gothic style. His successors finished the vaults of the nave by 1437, and those of the choir by 1451.

During the final phase of 1452–1520, the tower was erected, financed by pilgrims and later by its proprietor, the city. Designed to reach 600 Mechlinian feet or about 167 metres, higher than any church tower would ever attain (Ulm Minster has measured 161 metres since the 19th century), the very heavy St. Rumbold&#x27;s tower was built on what had once been wetlands, though with foundations only three metres deep its site appears to have been well-chosen. After a few years, in 1454, its chief architect Andries I Keldermans constructed the Saint Livinus&#x27; Monster Tower (or &quot;St.-Lievensmonstertoren&quot; as it is called in Dutch) in Zierikzee (in the present-day Netherlands), where leaning or sagging of the tower (now 62 metres but designed for ca. 130) could wreck the church. This concern led to fully separate edifices, a solution also applied in Mechelen. At both places, in the early 16th century the upper part of the tower was abandoned, not for technical but for financial reasons. St-Rumbold&#x27;s should have been topped by a 77-metre spire but only seven metres of this were built, hence the unusual shape. A deliberately weak connection closed the gap between tower and church upon finishing the construction.

===Later history===
The church has functioned as a cathedral since 1559. In the 18th century, each capital&#x27;s surrounding ornament of sculpted cabbage leaves, that had been an inspiration for numerous Brabantine Gothic churches, was replaced with a double ring of crops. In 2005, after engineers had figured out the support capacity of ground and tower, there was talk of completing the entire spire from the original drawings. In 2010, prior to the construction of an underground car park at Saint Rumbold&#x27;s north side, 4,165 skeletons were unearthed during archeological excavations of the cemetery.

==Tower==

The flat-topped silhouette of the cathedral&#x27;s tower is easily recognizable and dominates the surroundings. For centuries it held the city documents, served as a watchtower, and could sound the fire alarm.
Despite its characteristic incompleteness, this World Heritage monument
is 97.28 metres high and its 514 steps are mounted by thousands of tourists every year, following the footsteps of Louis XV, Napoleon, King Albert I, and King Baudouin with queen Fabiola in 1981.

Many of the region&#x27;s cities have a nickname for their populace. The Mechlinians are said to have had ancestors running up their great Tower and passing on buckets of water to extinguish a blazing fire behind the perpendicular windows, where it turned out to be mere moonlight through sprightly clouds, hence are called &quot;Maneblussers&quot; (&#x27;Moon Extinguishers&#x27;).

==Bells==
The tower contains 49 bells and only the largest bells swing, which are still in working order. The weights of the bells range from 16 kg to the most notable bell; the bourdon &quot;Salvator&quot;, which strikes the hours and weighs 8 tons. Up to 1923, the cathedral had 18 bell ringers prior to electricity taking over. Thirty-nine steps above this instrument, there is a second complete carillon on which concerts are played during the summer months.

==Interior==
The main entrance, underneath the tower, leads into the nave of the cathedral (approximately 118 metres long).

Apart from small heraldic shields, dating from the Thirty Knights of the Golden Fleece chapter meetings presided in the church by young Philip the Handsome while his Burgundian inheritance was still under guardianship of his father, few original movables survive. Forty preciously decorated Gothic altars and all other furniture disappeared during the religious troubles of 1566–1585. Though the cathedral was spared in the 1566 Iconoclasm, Mechelen was sacked in the 1572 three-days &quot;Spanish Fury&quot; by slaughtering troops under command of Alva&#x27;s son Fadrique, and suffered the English Fury of pillaging by rampant mercenaries in the service of the States General in 1580.

The interior features a Baroque high altar and choir by Lucas Faydherbe (with twenty-five paintings illustrating the life of Saint Rumbold), as well as paintings by Anthony van Dyck, sculptures by Lucas Faydherbe and Michiel Vervoort, and stained-glass windows,
including one depicting – though with a white face – the Black Madonna painting in the church.

==Organs==
The cathedral has two organs. The main organ on the reverse side of the west facade was built in 1957 by organ builder Stevens. On the reverse of the side facade is a smaller organ, installed there in 1919 by the same organ builder Stevens. This instrument has 30 stops on two manual keyboards and pedalboard.

==Events at the cathedral==
St. Rumbold&#x27;s was the venue for the 2008 wedding of Count Rodolphe de Limburg Stirum to Archduchess Marie-Christine of Austria, daughter of Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg.

===Papal visit===
In 1985, on his 65th birthday, Pope John Paul II celebrated a Mass at St. Rumbold&#x27;s. Jo Haazen, then the city&#x27;s carillon player, heard him state: &quot;Your tower is not complete.&quot;

<doc id="536887" wikidata="Q7343175" url="?curid=536887" title="Robert Crandall">
<text>Robert Lloyd &quot;Bob&quot; Crandall (born December 6, 1935, in Westerly, Rhode Island) is an American businessman who is the former president and chairman of American Airlines. Called an industry legend by airline industry observers, Crandall has been the subject of several books and is a member of the Hall of Honor of the Conrad Hilton college.

==Early life==
The Great Depression forced Robert Crandall&#x27;s father to leave Rhode Island to work selling life insurance, which resulted in multiple relocations. Crandall ended up attending 13 schools before his high school graduation.
He graduated from the University of Rhode Island, and from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, with an MBA.

== Airline career ==
In 1966, he joined TWA, where he worked for six years. In 1972, he left to become a senior financial officer at Bloomingdale&#x27;s Department Stores, but he returned to the airline industry in 1973, as senior financial vice president of American.

In 1982, he had a famous conversation with Braniff CEO Howard D. Putnam, in which he told Putnam that if Braniff raised their prices, American would too. Crandall has publicly expressed embarrassment over that conversation. That same year, Crandall became American&#x27;s president. In 1985, Crandall succeeded Albert Casey as American&#x27;s chairman and CEO.

During the latter period of Crandall&#x27;s tenure as CEO, investor concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices caused Crandall to remind his employees about the dangers of investing in airline stocks. Known for his candor, Crandall later told an interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;ve never invested in any airline. I&#x27;m an airline manager. I don&#x27;t invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, &#x27;This is not an appropriate investment. It&#x27;s a great place to work and it&#x27;s a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.&#x27;&quot; Crandall noted that since the airline deregulation of the 1970s, some 150 airlines had gone out of business. &quot;A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money,&quot; he said.

Crandall is credited with creating the first major mileage-reward frequent flyer program in the airline industry, the AAdvantage program, as well as pioneering modern reservations systems through the creation of Sabre. He is also credited with pioneering yield management. Crandall also serves as a senior adviser and sits on the board of AirCell, an in-flight telephony company which won the larger of two licenses for air-ground data service that provide in-flight broadband service.

In 1998, he retired from American and he went on to work as director of many other companies, including Celestica, Haliburton, and Anixter. 

=== Criticism of deregulation ===

Before the passing of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, Crandall was one of the act&#x27;s loudest opponents. When asked to comment on deregulation in June 2008, Crandall stated:

In 2018, he stated:
===Reputation for cost-cutting===
While at American Airlines in the 1980s, Crandall was famed for his focus on cost-cutting. One story that has been frequently retold since is that he came up with the idea to remove one olive from every salad served to passengers. No one would notice and the airline would save $40,000 a year. Another story, which Crandall himself shared, involved cutting security at a Caribbean station warehouse to the point that the only guard left was a sound recording of a guard dog barking.

==Honors and awards==
* Hall of Honor of the Conrad Hilton college.
* Horatio Alger award, 1997.
* &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; for outstanding leadership in the commercial aviation industry, 2001.
* L. Welch Pogue Award for Lifetime Achievement in Aviation, 2004.
* Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association, 2006.

<doc id="536889" wikidata="Q19829485" url="?curid=536889" title="Marmoset">
<text>The marmosets (), also known as zaris or sagoin, are twenty-two New World monkey species of the genera &quot;Callithrix&quot;, &quot;Cebuella&quot;, &quot;Callibella&quot;, and &quot;Mico&quot;. All four genera are part of the biological family Callitrichidae. The term &quot;marmoset&quot; is also used in reference to Goeldi&#x27;s marmoset, &quot;Callimico goeldii&quot;, which is closely related.

Most marmosets are about long. Relative to other monkeys, they show some apparently primitive features; they have claws rather than nails, and tactile hairs on their wrists. They lack wisdom teeth, and their brain layout seems to be relatively primitive. Their body temperature is unusually variable, changing by up to in a day. Marmosets are native to South America and have been found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru. They have also been occasionally spotted in Central America and southern Mexico. They are sometimes kept as pets, though they have specific dietary and habitat needs that require consideration.

According to recent research, marmosets exhibit germline chimerism, which is not known to occur in nature in any primates other than callitrichids. 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions, making them hematopoietic chimeras.

==Etymology==
&quot;Callithrix&quot; comes from Ancient Greek and means &quot;beautiful fur&quot;.

** Pygmy marmoset, &quot;Cebuella pygmaea&quot;

==Behavior==

Marmosets are highly active, living in the upper canopy of forest trees, and feeding on insects, fruit, leaves, tack, sap, and gum. They have long lower incisors, which allow them to chew holes in tree trunks and branches to harvest the gum inside; some species are specialised feeders on gum.

Marmosets live in family groups of three to 15, consisting of one or two breeding females, an unrelated male, their offspring, and occasionally extended family members and unrelated individuals. Their mating systems are highly variable and can include monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry. In most species, fraternal twins are usually born, but triplets are not unknown. Like other callitrichines, marmosets are characterized by a high degree of cooperative care of the young and some food sharing and tolerated theft. Adult males, females other than the mother, and older offspring participate in carrying infants. Father marmosets are an exceptionally attentive example of fathers within the animal kingdom, going as far as assisting their mates in giving birth, cleaning up afterbirth, and even biting the umbilical cords attaching their newborn offspring to their mothers. Most groups scent mark and defend the edges of their ranges, but whether they are truly territorial is unclear, as group home ranges greatly overlap.

The favorite food of marmosets is carbohydrate-rich tree sap, which they reach by gnawing holes in trunks. Their territories are centered on the trees that they regularly exploit in this way. The smaller marmosets venture into the very top of forest canopies to hunt insects that are abundant there.

Marmosets use chirps, trills, and &quot;phee&quot; calls to communicate with each other. &quot;Phee&quot; calls are long-distance vocalizations that help monkeys identify each other&#x27;s locations. Marmosets have been observed to use distinctive &quot;phee&quot; calls for the different individuals in their group, similar to a human name.

<text>The pepper-box revolver or simply pepperbox (also &quot;pepper-pot&quot;, from its resemblance to the household pepper shakers) is a multiple-barrel firearm, mostly in the form of a handgun, that has three or more gun barrels in a revolving mechanism. Each barrel holds a single shot, and the shooter can manually rotate the whole barrel assembly to sequentially index each barrel into alignment with the lock or hammer, similar to rotation of a revolver&#x27;s cylinder.

Pepperbox guns have existed for all types of firelock firearms and metal cased ammunition systems used in breechloading firearms: matchlock, wheellock, flintlock, caplock, pinfire, rimfire, and centerfire. While they are usually sidearms, a few long guns were also made. For example, Samuel Colt owned a three-barrel pepperbox matchlock musket from British India, and an eight-barrel pepperbox shotgun was designed in 1967, but never went into production.

==Early years==

This type of firearm was popular in North America from 1830 until the American Civil War, but the concept was introduced much earlier. In the 15th century, Ribauldequin, a version of the volley gun, had several single shot barrels were attached to a stock, being fired individually by means of a match. Around 1790, pepperboxes were built on the basis of flintlock systems, notably by Nock in England and &quot;Segallas&quot; in Belgium. Building on the success of the earlier two-barrel turnover pistols, they were fitted with three, four or seven barrels. These early pepperboxes were hand rotated.

The invention of the percussion cap building on the percussion powder innovations of the Rev. Alexander Forsyth&#x27;s patent of 1807 (which ran until 1821), and the industrial revolution allowed pepperbox revolvers to be mass-produced, making them more affordable than the early handmade guns previously only seen in the hands of the rich. Examples of these early weapons are the American three-barrel Manhattan pistol, the English Budding (probably the first English percussion pepperbox) and the Swedish Engholm. Most percussion pepperboxes have a circular flange around the rear of the cylinder to prevent the capped nipples being accidentally fired if the gun were to be knocked while in a pocket or dropped and to protect the eyes from cap fragments.

==Popularity==
The pepperbox, or at least the firearm that is mostly associated with this term, was invented in the 1830s and was intended for civilian use, but military officers often made private purchases for their own use. The design spread rapidly in the United States, the United Kingdom and some parts of continental Europe. It was similar to the later revolver in that it contained bullets in separate chambers in a rotating cylinder. Unlike the revolver, however, each chamber had its own barrel, making a complex indexing system unnecessary (though pepperboxes with such a system do exist). Originally these pistols were muzzle loaders, but in 1837 the Belgian gunsmith Mariette invented a hammerless pepperbox with a ring trigger and turn off barrels that could be unscrewed.

A few percussion pepperboxes were still hand-rotated but most have a mechanism that rotates the barrel group as the hammer is cocked for each shot. Single-action versions were made, notably by Darling of Massachusetts, but the vast majority use the self-cocking system whereby pressing the trigger rotates the barrel block, cocks the hammer and finally fires the weapon. The main producer of self-cocking top hammer pepperboxes (mostly referred to as &quot;bar-hammer pepperbox&quot;) in the United States was Ethan Allen, but this type of weapon was also produced in large quantities in England.

Some pepperboxes fired the lower barrel instead of the upper, such as the American Blunt &amp; Syms, the English Cooper or the Belgian Mariette (with configurations between three and twenty-four barrels). Usually, these employed an &quot;underhammer&quot; action, with the hammer mounted under the frame, behind the barrels, and forward of the trigger (often a ring-trigger). Several other types of firing mechanisms exist, such as rotating internal firing pins (Rigby, Robbins and Lawrence, Comblain), rotating firing pins on a hammer (Sharps, Grunbaum) or multiple firing pins (Martin). During the early 1830s English gunsmith Joseph Manton offered a variant with a retractable knife blade, and pistols with up to 18 barrels. The Robbins &amp; Lawrence pepperboxes of 1851–1854 had rifled barrels, a break action breechloading mechanism and an early safety catch, meaning that it was not necessary to disassemble the gun to reload it.

The flaw with the pepperbox design is that it becomes more front-heavy if the length and number of barrels are increased, making accurate aiming difficult. With most types, in particular, those with rotating barrel clusters, it is almost impossible to aim beyond close range because the hammer is in the line of sight (some pepperboxes have a slot in the hammer through which one is supposed to aim), there is no place to put a front sight (putting one for each barrel would only increase the weight of the front end and likely make drawing the weapon awkward), and the gun is too front heavy to permit quick and steady aiming. However, the primary market was for civilian self-defense, so its most common use was at close range. Common practice at the time, indeed, was not to aim pistols, but instead to &quot;shoot from the hip&quot;, holding the gun low and simply pointing at the target&#x27;s center of mass. Gunfights often happened at a very close range. With this use in mind, many pepperboxes, in fact, have smooth-bored barrels, even though rifling had been commonly used for decades by the time of their manufacture. In the Old West, large pepperboxes were favored by the gold prospectors of 1849, for protection against robbers, rival claimants and hostile native Americans. Both American and British made pepperboxes were also popular among gold miners in Australia as a cheaper alternative to the Colt Navy revolver, and several were used at the Eureka Stockade.

Multi-shot percussion firearms were often considered dangerous because firing one powder charge could ignite the others (a &quot;chainfire&quot;), all at the same time, when proper care was not taken. This problem was largely eliminated by the introduction of nipple partitions, evident on later percussion revolvers, which largely shielded the percussion caps on neighbouring chambers from the flash struck by the weapon&#x27;s hammer during firing. However, this feature is rarely seen on pepperboxes, although some had the nipples placed in recesses or at right angles to each other to reduce the chance of a chainfire. A chainfire in a pepperbox would be far less dangerous than in a single-barreled revolver because, with a pepperbox, each of its bullets could freely exit its own dedicated barrel (essentially turning it into an impromptu volley gun). Similarly, if a chamber was not in exactly the right position when the hammer hit the cap it would fire normally and safely, as opposed to a single-barrelled revolver where a cylinder misaligned with the barrel when fired could cause a potentially explosive malfunction. This simplicity and safety helped the pepperbox survive after more modern revolvers came along, as well as keeping production costs a lot lower than revolvers with their more complex mechanisms.

==Transitional revolver==


A development from the pepperboxes are the so-called &quot;transitional&quot; revolvers. These weapons have a cut-down pepperbox &quot;cylinder&quot; firing through a single barrel. A transitional revolver is defined as a revolver (with barrel and cylinder) that does not have a cylinder stop, an early example being the 1739&#x27;s revolver of Jaumandreu from Manresa and the 1702&#x27;s revolver of Rovira from Ripoll, exhibited in the Armouries of the Tower of London, followed 100 years later by the Collier flintlock revolver of 1819. 

It retained the pepperbox&#x27;s caplock action but still had many deficiencies. The lack of an effective cylinder stop allowed a charge to be fired when the cylinder was not aligned with the barrel, resulting in an erratic shot possibly damaging the gun and even injuring the firer. While the shortened cylinder made loading easier the barrel was attached to the cylinder pin, over time this weakened the gun, decreasing its accuracy. In addition, it lacked partitions between its nipples, risking similar chain-fires to the earlier pepperbox. This was exacerbated by the fact that the bar-hammers common on pepperboxes and transitional revolvers usually provided a weak blow, which meant that extra sensitive percussion caps were needed to ensure that the gun would fire, further increasing the risk of a chain-fire. Although later models were fitted with a shield to protect the user from cap fragments, there was still a risk of being killed or maimed as a multiple discharge could cause the gun to explode.

Since the bullets didn&#x27;t have to be rammed down from the muzzle but were loaded into the cylinder behind the barrel, they could be slightly larger than the bore, which facilitated the use of rifled barrels. Whereas most pepperboxes are smooth-bore, most transitionals are rifled.

Daniel Leavitt was the subject of a lawsuit after producing a transitional revolver in 1851 with an identical loading lever to the Colt Dragoon revolver. Guns of this type saw use in the Mexican War as an alternative to the Colt Dragoon revolver and the Colt Walker revolver, most notably by General Winfield Scott. A late example the Butterfield revolver of 1855 used a Maynard tape primer rather than percussion caps. 640 were issued to the US Army during the American Civil War, but the government canceled any further purchases when the pistols were found to be inferior to the cheaper Colt Navy revolver. Transitional revolvers and pepperboxes started disappearing gradually in the 1850s with the manufacture of true revolvers by Colt, Smith &amp; Wesson, Webley, Adams, Rupertus and others.

==Revival==

The pepperbox experienced a kind of &quot;revival&quot; in the late 19th century as a short, easily concealable pocket pistol that used pinfire cartridges. The five-barrel Feilitzenre pistol was almost accepted as the standard officer sidearm for the Swedish Army.

A special variation of this kind of sidearm, in which the shortness of the barrel cluster was fully used, is the Belgian Dolne M1869 Apache revolver. This weapon, allegedly popular among the Paris street gangs after whom it was named, was fitted with a folding blade and knuckle-duster. The pepperboxes from this period disappeared with the demise of the pinfire cartridge.

One of the more interesting pepperbox revolvers is the .22 Short, six-barrel Remington Zig-Zag Derringer. Unlike the older single action designs, it had a double action ring trigger and could fire six shots as fast as one could pull the trigger. Guns of this type were prized by gamblers, in addition to the four-barrel Christian Sharps derringer, because they could be easily concealed in a vest pocket and easily used for self-defense.

==Modern use==
The pepperbox design was used for a small number of weapon designs in the 20th century, most notably a six-barrelled derringer in .22 caliber from Cobray.

During the 1960s an eight-barrelled pepperbox shotgun, the Colt Defender Mark I, was designed by Robert Hillberg; but never went into production.

In the 1970s Heckler &amp; Koch produced the five-barrelled P11 pistol designed as a covert underwater firearm firing 7.62 X 36mm darts electrically.

The four-barreled COP .357 Derringer was manufactured from 1983 to 1989 by the later defunct COP Inc. of California, US (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police).

The Osa is a Russian four-barrelled pistol designed to fire a range of non-lethal and flare rounds from electrically-fired 18×45 mm cartridges.

The Reprringer is a design for a five-barrelled 3D printed pepperbox sidearm in .22 LR, which received widespread media coverage.

3D printed pistols resembling the pepperbox have been allegedly downloaded and manufactured by drug dealers in the UK. A student from London named Tendai Muswere was the first person convicted in 2019 of printing a multi-barrelled derringer of this type, known as the Hexen.

== Popular culture ==
In the first season of &quot;Critical Role&quot;, and its animated adaptation &quot;The Legend of Vox Machina&quot;, the character Percival de Rolo III, played by Taliesin Jaffe, invented and wielded a pepperbox revolver.

<text>Pirkkala (; ) is a municipality in Finland, located in the Pirkanmaa region. It lies to the southwest of the regional capital, Tampere. The population of Pirkkala is approximately , while the metropolitan area has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

Pirkkala has an area of of which is water. The population density is , which makes it the most densely populated municipality in Finland that does not use the title of town or city. Pirkkala is also currently the fastest-growing municipality in the Pirkanmaa region. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Tampere-Pirkkala Airport is located in southwest Pirkkala. The most significant main road in Pirkkala is Tampere Ring Road.

==History==

===Great Pirkkala===
The former parish of Suur-Pirkkala (Great Pirkkala) is mentioned in historical writings from the 14th century. It occupied over half of Pirkanmaa, a region nowadays populated by about 526,000 inhabitants. Suur-Pirkkala began to split when new parishes and municipalities were founded and wanted independence. 

===South and North Pirkkala===
In 1922 the Pirkkala was split into Pohjois- (Northern) and Etelä-Pirkkala (Southern Pirkkala) due to a movement in Southern Pirkkala led by agronomist Hannes Palmroth of the Partola Estate to gain independence from the more industrial North. 

===Pirkkala===
In 1938 the name of Northern Pirkkala was changed to Nokia and after an appeal to the President of Finland Kyösti Kallio in 1939, Southern Pirkkala reverted to its original name Pirkkala. The present-day province of Pirkanmaa that was founded in the 1950s is named after Pirkkala as it was in the center of the region that was more or less the same area as the historic Great Pirkkala

==Sights==
Pirkkala has been inhabited by the Stone Age and Iron Age, and many ancient finds have been made in the area.

The red-brick old church was designed by Ilmari Launis in 1921, and it is known that it was built on the site of the old Pirkkala parish church. The white new church from 1994, designed by Simo Paavilainen and Käpy Paavilainen, is located near the current town center, Naistenmatka. In its year of completion, the church, which has a modern appearance, was chosen as the most beautiful new building in Finland.

The Sculpture Park has been formed near the municipal center from the works of art of the international cast iron symposia of 2001 and 2003. It consists of sculptures of contemporary art, which are mostly placed around Lake Vähäjärvi. The idea of the cast iron symposiums is Villu Jaanisoo, an artist from Pirkkala who moved from Estonia to Finland. Other materials were used in the 2003 event. Perhaps the most prominent of the sights is the Jaaniso&#x27;s &quot;Peruspirkkalalainen&quot; statue on the edge of the Suupantori market square in the town center, or the &quot;Valte&quot; statue according to its model.

<text>The Michigan Brigade, sometimes called the Wolverines, the Michigan Cavalry Brigade or Custer&#x27;s Brigade, was a brigade of cavalry in the volunteer Union Army during the later half of the American Civil War. Composed primarily of the 1st Michigan Cavalry, 5th Michigan Cavalry, 6th Michigan Cavalry and 7th Michigan Cavalry, the Michigan Brigade fought in every major campaign of the Army of the Potomac from the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 to the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865.

The brigade first gained fame during the Gettysburg Campaign under the command of youthful Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer. After the war, several men associated with the brigade joined the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment and later fought again under Custer in the Old West frontier.

==Service record==
===Organization and the Gettysburg Campaign===
The Michigan Cavalry Brigade was created on December 12, 1862, at Washington, D.C. It originally consisted of the 5th, 6th and 7th Michigan Cavalry regiments, under the command of General Joseph T. Copeland. During the early part of the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, the 1st Michigan Cavalry and Battery M, 2nd United States Artillery were added to the brigade in central Maryland as part of a major reorganization of the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s Cavalry Corps by its commander, Alfred Pleasonton.

The larger brigade was assigned to the newly promoted Custer, who assumed command near Westminster, Maryland. The Michigan Brigade saw its first combat action as an entity at the Battle of Hanover in southern Pennsylvania on June 30, 1863. There, Custer&#x27;s men were deployed as a strong advance skirmish line south of town. Two days later, on July 2, the brigade participated in the Battle of Hunterstown, where one of the Wolverines, Norville Churchill, rescued a fallen Custer, who was pinned in the road under his slain horse.

At the subsequent Battle of Gettysburg, the Michigan Brigade was posted east of Gettysburg along the Hanover Road on July 3. On the third day, the brigade fought in piecemeal fashion, with the 5th and 6th serving as dismounted skirmishers near the John Rummel farm on the left of the battlefield, while first the 7th and then the 1st Michigan charged into a growing mounted melee in the center. Custer&#x27;s cry of &quot;Come on, you Wolverines!&quot; became the rallying cry of the brigade.

During the retreat of the Army of Northern Virginia from Gettysburg, Custer&#x27;s men maintained a series of skirmishes and encounters with the Confederate rear guard, fighting another battle at Falling Waters as the last of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army slipped across the Potomac River. The skirmishing continued well into Virginia, including a minor affair at Amissville.

===Bristoe and Mine Run Campaigns===
During the balance of 1863, the Michigan Brigade performed scouting and patrol duty, as well as screening the flanks of the Army of the Potomac. The brigade again engaged in a series of fights with J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s Confederates during the Bristoe Campaign and the subsequent Mine Run Campaign.

===1864===
For a time, the 1st Vermont Cavalry was assigned to the Michigan Brigade.

In February 1864, the Michigan Brigade participated in Judson Kilpatrick&#x27;s large 5,000-man cavalry raid on the Confederacy&#x27;s capital city, Richmond, Virginia. Kilpatrick&#x27;s objectives for the daring raid were to free Federal prisoners of war, cut supply lines, and create panic among the Confederate civilians and government officials. Carrying only rations for two days, the troopers were expected to live off the land by foraging for food. Kilpatrick&#x27;s men severed all the rail lines between Richmond and the Army of Northern Virginia, but did not enter Richmond or free the prisoners.

During the Overland Campaign in May, the Michigan men were engaged in Philip H. Sheridan&#x27;s raid, fighting at the Battle of Haw&#x27;s Shop on May 28. There, due to the heavily wooded terrain, Custer dismounted the brigade and deployed in a long, double-ranked line of battle, as if they were infantrymen. However, Custer inspired his men by staying mounted as he led them forward, waving his hat in full view of the enemy. Some of the relatively inexperienced South Carolina Confederate infantry mistook a Union shift in position for a retreat and charged after them, only to run into Custer&#x27;s men, who captured eighty Confederates. Forty-one Michigan cavalrymen fell in the attack, but their enthusiastic charge caused Wade Hampton&#x27;s men to withdraw.

At Trevilian Station on June 11 and 12, the brigade was heavily engaged. Custer maneuvered into a position in the rear of (and between) two Confederate divisions and seized the train depot and a large cache of supplies. However, subsequent enemy movements left the Michigan Brigade nearly surrounded, and Custer had to fight his way out of the encirclement.

In July, the brigade rode to Washington, D.C. en route to the Shenandoah Valley, then threatened by a Confederate force under Jubal A. Early. The Michigan Brigade was engaged at Winchester, Virginia, on August 11, as well as in numerous other small engagements through September, when it fought at the Battle of Opequon, also near Winchester, where it captured three Confederate battle flags. The brigade was again in action at the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill.

On September 26, Custer was promoted to divisional command and Colonel James H. Kidd of the 6th Michigan assumed direct command of the Michigan Brigade. The brigade spent the rest of the year in the Valley, engaging in a series of running fights with Confederate cavalry, including the decisive victory over Jubal Early at the Battle of Cedar Creek.

===1865===
On February 27, General Sheridan commenced a major movement against Early&#x27;s remaining forces in the Valley and his communications and supply lines. The Michigan Brigade participated in an engagement at Louisa Court House against enemy cavalry under Thomas L. Rosser, routing the Confederates and capturing the village and its important stores of military supplies.

Not long afterward, following Early&#x27;s final crushing defeat at the Battle of Waynesboro, Sheridan&#x27;s force was reassigned to the Richmond area to help Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s final push to break Lee&#x27;s entrenchments. The Michigan Brigade arrived at White House, landing in time to participate in some of the final engagements of the Army of the Potomac, including the Battle of Five Forks on April 1. They were active in the pursuit of Lee&#x27;s retreating army following the fall of Richmond and again engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Sayler&#x27;s Creek on April 6. They were among the troops that finally blocked Lee&#x27;s planned escape route, precipitating the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House.

Under the command of Colonel Peter Stagg, the Michigan Brigade was part of Sheridan&#x27;s force that rode southward to Petersburg, Virginia, and then proceeded into North Carolina to assist William T. Sherman&#x27;s army in its quest to defeat another Confederate army under Joseph E. Johnston. However, Johnston surrendered before Sheridan arrived. The Michigan Brigade returned to Washington, D.C., for the Grand Review of the Armies on May 23.

===Western frontier duty===
Immediately after the review, the Michigan Brigade received orders to serve in the Western frontier in the District of the Plains, Department of Missouri. Using railroads and a series of riverboats, the brigade arrived at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 2,300 strong but with only 600 horses. There, the 5th Michigan was formally mustered out of the service, as well as portions of the other three regiments whose enlistments had expired, in all half the brigade. The remaining troopers saw subsequent duty in the Dakota Territory in the forces of Patrick Connor until December.

In late 1865, the remnants of the much depleted brigade were consolidated into the 1st Michigan Veteran Cavalry and served in the Montana Territory. Despite the fact that their term of enlistment had expired, the remaining men were kept in the service until March 10, 1866, when they were finally mustered out and allowed to return home to Michigan. Some men elected to stay on the frontier and enlist in Custer&#x27;s 7th U.S. Cavalry; a few former members of the Michigan Brigade fought at the Battle of Little Big Horn in June 1876.

Most veterans of the Michigan Brigade were active in various fraternal organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic, and many men returned to Gettysburg for the 25th Anniversary commemorations. A few returned in 1913 for the 50th Anniversary.

A modern non-profit group calling itself the Michigan Cavalry Brigade Association serves as living historians and reenactors.

<text>Königstein Fortress (), the &quot;Saxon Bastille&quot;, is a hilltop fortress near Dresden, in Saxon Switzerland, Germany, above the town of Königstein on the left bank of the River Elbe. It is one of the largest hilltop fortifications in Europe and sits atop the table hill of the same name.

The rock plateau rises above the Elbe and has over 50 buildings, some over 400 years old, that bear witness to the military and civilian life in the fortress. The rampart run of the fortress is long with walls up to high and steep sandstone faces. In the centre of the site is a well, which is the deepest in Saxony and second-deepest well in Europe.

The fortress, which for centuries was used as a state prison, is still intact and is now one of Saxony&#x27;s foremost tourist attractions, with 700,000 visitors per year.

== Construction and expansion of the fortress ==


By far the oldest written record of a castle on the Königstein is found in a deed by King Wenceslas I of Bohemia dating to the year 1233, in which a witness is named as &quot;Burgrave Gebhard of Stein&quot;. At that time the region was split between the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Bishopric of Meissen. The medieval castle belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Its first full description as &quot;Königstein&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Rock&quot;) occurred in the Upper Lusatian Border Charter (&quot;Oberlausitzer Grenzurkunde&quot;) of 1241, that Wenceslas I &quot;in lapide regis&quot; (Lat.: at the rock of the king) sealed. In this charter the demarcation of the border between the Slavic &quot;Gauen&quot; of Milska (Upper Lusatia), Nisani (Meißen Depression) and Dacena (Tetschen region) was laid down. Because the Königstein lay left of the Elbe, it was independent of the 3 aforementioned &quot;Gauen&quot;.

It belonged at that time to the Kingdom of Bohemia and was expanded by order of the Bohemian kings, as the Elbe became more intensively used as a trade route, into a fortified site that dominated the north of their territories, controlling the Elbe above Pirna, and an outpost of strategically important Dohna Castle located in the nearby Müglitz.

After the king and later emperor, Charles IV had Eulau Castle, which dominated the southern region, destroyed in 1348 by townsfolk from Aussig, he spent from 5 to 19 August 1359 on the Königstein and signed the authority for shipping rights. The castle was pledged several times in the 50 years that followed, including to the Donins. Because this family were enemies of the margraves of Meißen, the latter finally captured the castle in 1408 during the Dohna Feud that had been raging since 1385. But not until 25 April 1459 was the transfer of the castle to the Margraviate of Meißen finally completed once the Saxon-Bohemian border had been settled in the Treaty of Eger. Unlike the other rock castles in Saxon Switzerland the Königstein continued to be used by the Saxon dukes and prince-electors for military purposes. At one stage the Königstein was also a monastery. In 1516, Duke George the Bearded, a fierce opponent of the Reformation, founded a Celestine abbey on the Königstein, the &quot;Kloster des Lobes der Wunder Mariae&quot;. It closed again in 1524 - after the death of Duke George, Saxony became Evangelical.
It is probable that there had been a stone castle on the Königstein as early as the 12th century. The oldest surviving structure today is the castle chapel built at the turn of the 13th century. In the years 1563 to 1569 the 152.5 metre deep well was bored into the rock within the castle - until that point the garrison of the Königstein had to obtain water from cisterns and by collecting rainwater. During the construction of the well some 8 cubic metres of water had to be removed from the shaft every day.

Between 1589 and 1591/97 Prince-Elector Christian I of Saxony and his successor had the castle developed into the strongest fortification in Saxony. The hitherto very jagged table hill was now surrounded with high walls. Buildings were erected, including the Gatehouse (&quot;Torhaus&quot;), the &quot;Streichwehr&quot;, the Old Barracks (&quot;Alte Kaserne&quot;), the &quot;Christiansburg&quot; (&quot;Friedrichsburg&quot;) and the Old Armoury (&quot;Altes Zeughaus&quot;). The second construction period followed from 1619 to 1681, during which &quot;inter alia&quot; the John George Bastion (&quot;Johann-Georgenbastion&quot;) was built in front of the &quot;Johann-Georgenburg&quot;. The third construction period is seen as the time from 1694 to 1756, which included the expansion of the Old Barracks. From 1722 to 1725, at the behest of August the Strong, coopers under Böttger built the enormous Königstein Wine Barrel (&quot;Königsteiner Weinfass&quot;), the greatest wine barrel in the world, in the cellar of the Magdalenenburg which had a capacity of 249,838 litres. It cost 8,230 thalers, 18 groschen and 9 pfennigs. The butt, which was once completely filled with country wine from the Meißen vineyards, had to be removed again in 1818 due to its poor condition. Because of Böttger, Königstein Fortress is also the site where European porcelain started.

Even after the expansion during those periods of time there continued to be modifications and additions on the extensive plateau. St. John&#x27;s Hall (&quot;Johannissaal&quot;) built in 1631 was converted in 1816 into the New Armoury (&quot;Neues Zeughaus&quot;). In 1819 the &quot;Magdalenenburg&quot; castle was turned into a provisions magazine that was fortified to withstand bombardment. The old provisions store became a barracks. The Treasury (&quot;Schatzhaus&quot;) was built from 1854 to 1855. After the fortress had been incorporated in 1871 into the fortification system of the new German Empire, battery ramparts (&quot;Batteriewälle&quot;) were constructed from 1870 to 1895 with eight firing points, that were to have provided all-round defence for the fortress in case of an attack that, in the event, never came. This was at this time that the last major building work was done on the fortress.

Because Königstein Fortress was regarded as unconquerable, the Saxon monarchs retreated to it from Wittenberg and later Dresden during times of crisis and also deposited the state treasure and many works of art from the famous Zwinger here; it was also used as a country retreat due to its lovely surroundings.

== Military significance ==

The fortress played an important role in the History of Saxony, albeit less as a result of military action. The Saxon Dukes and Prince-Electors used the fortress primarily as a secure refuge during times of war, as a hunting lodge and maison de plaisance, but also as a dreaded state prison. Its actual military significance was rather marginal, although generals such as John Everard of Droste and Zützen (1662–1726) commanded it. For example, Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II could only watch helplessly from the Königstein during the Seven Years&#x27; War, when right at the start of the war in 1756 his army surrendered without a fight to the Prussian Army at the foot of the Lilienstein on the other side of the Elbe. The commandant of the fortress from 1753 was the electoral Saxon Lieutenant General, Michael Lorenz von Pirch. In August 1813 the clash at Krietzschwitz took place in front of its gates, an engagement that proved an important precursor to the Battle of Kulm and the Battle of Leipzig.
In October 1866 Alexander von Rohrscheidt (1808–1881) was nominated as commandant of the fortress. It lost its military value with the development of long-range guns at the beginning of the 19th century. The last commandant of Königstein Fortress was Lieutenant Colonel Heinicke who commanded it until 1913. The fortress had to guard the Saxon state reserves and secret archives during times of war. In 1756 and 1813 Dresden&#x27;s art treasures were also stored at the Königstein. During the Second World War the large casemates of the fortress were also used for such purposes.

The fortress was never conquered, it had too much of a chilling reputation after it had been expanded by Elector Christian I. Only the chimney sweep, , managed to climb the vertical sandstone walls in 1848. The Abratzky Chimney (&quot;Abratzky-Kamin&quot;) named after him is a grade IV (based on the Saxon system) climbing route that may still be climbed today. Because climbing over the wall is banned, climbers must abseil down the adjacent wall again after climbing it.

== Use as a prison ==
Until 1922 the fortress was the best-known state prison in Saxony. During the Franco-Prussian War and the two world wars the fortress was also used as a prisoner of war camp. In World War I the castle was used as a prisoner of war camp (&quot;Oflag&quot;) for French and Russian officers. In World War II it again served as an &quot;Oflag&quot;, called &quot;Oflag IV-B&quot;, for British, French, Polish and other Allied officers.

After the Second World War the Red Army used the fortress as a military hospital. From 1949 to 1955 it was used as a so-called &quot;Jugendwerkhof&quot; for the reeducation of delinquent youths and those who did not fit the image of a socialist society.

Some of the more notable prisoners incarcerated at Königstein are given below (dates of imprisonment in parentheses):

*the Crypto-Calvinists, including Caspar Peucer (1574–86) and Nikolaus Krell (1591–1601), chancellor of the Electorate of Saxony
* Count Wolf Dietrich von Beichlingen (1703–1709), great chancellor and senior court-marshal of the Electorate of Saxony
* Franz Conrad Romanus (1705–1746), &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; of Leipzig
* Johann Friedrich Böttger (1706–1707), co-discoverer with Tschirnhaus of European porcelain
* Johann Reinhold von Patkul (1706–1707), Livonian statesman
* Count Karl Heinrich von Hoym (1734–1736), cabinet minister of the Electorate of Saxony; committed suicide in his cell
* Mikhail Bakunin (1849–1850), Russian anarchist and revolutionary
* August Bebel (1872–1874), German politician, president of the SPD, founder of German social democracy
* Thomas Theodor Heine (1899), caricaturist and artist
* Frank Wedekind (1899–1900), writer and dramatist
* Henri Giraud (1940–1942), French general; successfully escaped from the castle
* Bertrand Fagalde (1940-1945), French general; captured just after the Battle of Dunkirk

Königstein was never taken, not even during World War II. However, on 17 April 1942, French General Henri Giraud successfully escaped German captivity from the castle.

== Military history open-air museum ==

Since 29 May 1955, the fortress has been an open-air, military history museum of high touristic value. The museum has been managed as a satellite of the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden since 1990.

In the years 1967 to 1970, a lift was built at the foot of the access path for 42 people. A second lift was built in 2005 against a vertical wall of the fortress, which transports up to 18 passengers in a lift with a panoramic view to a height of about 42 metres. The state of Saxony made 1.7 million euros available for the project. The lift opened Easter 2006.

Between 1991 and 2010, a total of about 46 million euros was invested by the Free State of Saxony on the renovation and upgrade of Königstein Fortress. The museum welcomed its 25 millionth visitor on 14 October 2005 since it opened Whitsun 1955.

Visitor numbers decreased somewhat from about 1,000,000 in 1999 to 446,000 in 2010.

==The fortress in art==
Around 1756, Elector Augustus III commissioned the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto to paint a series of five large-scale views of the fortress at Königstein. The canvasses were never delivered to the Elector due to the hostilities of the Seven Years&#x27; War and were eventually exported to Great Britain. Today, four of the Königstein paintings are held in public collections in Britain: &quot;The Fortress of Königstein from the North&quot; is in the National Gallery; &quot;The Fortress of Königstein from the South&quot; is at Knowsley Hall, Merseyside; and both &quot;The Fortress of Königstein: Courtyard with the Brunnenhaus&quot; and &quot;The Fortress of Königstein: Courtyard with the Magdalenenburg&quot;, hang in the Manchester Art Gallery. The fifth canvas, &quot;The Fortress of Königstein from the North-West&quot;, is now in the United States, on display in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

In Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;, it is during an excursion to Königstein, &quot;the fortress constructed on that wonderful rock,&quot; that the hero, Phineas Finn, learns from his first love, who had refused his offer of marriage, that she had in fact always loved him, and continues to.

<text>The Monon Bell (pronounced MOE-non) is the trophy awarded to the victor of the annual college football matchup between the Wabash College Little Giants (in Crawfordsville, Indiana) and the DePauw University Tigers (in Greencastle, Indiana) in the United States. The Bell is a 300-pound locomotive bell from the Monon Railroad. As of the end of the 2024 regular season, the two teams have played against each other 130 times. Wabash leads the all-time series, 63-58-9, and also has a slight advantage since the Bell was introduced as the victor&#x27;s trophy in 1932, 44-42-6.

==Series history==
The rivalry game between Wabash and DePauw began in 1890 and is among the oldest college football rivalries. The hit 1904 play &quot;The College Widow&quot;, and its subsequent film adaptations, were loosely based on the rivalry.

The Monon Bell was introduced as a traveling trophy in 1932 at the suggestion of a DePauw alumnus, Orien Fifer (Class of 1925), in a letter to the editor of &quot;The Indianapolis News&quot;. Since the schools are only 27 miles apart, the adversaries in the game are often brothers, cousins, high school classmates or good friends, adding to the rivalry&#x27;s intensity. Before the introduction of overtime to college football, nine ties were logged in the series. By rule, in the event of a tie, the Bell was awarded to the previous owner. In the 1960 matchup, DePauw held the Bell and scored a last-minute touchdown to cut Wabash&#x27;s lead to 13–12. DePauw coach Tommy Mont turned to the stands and spread out his hands. The DePauw fans shouted &quot;Go!&quot; DePauw scored on the conversion and won 14–13. This rule also held significance for the 99th Monon Bell Classic in 1992 in which from the 8 yard line Wabash opted for a field goal to tie the game at 17-17 (the kick hit the right upright, but still went through) and retained ownership of the Bell. This tie set up the 100th game as an evenly split 45-45-9 series, in which Wabash won, 40–26. 

The teams failed to play each other only six years in the entire history. From 1897 to 1899, the schools did not schedule each other for an unknown reason. In 1910, the teams didn&#x27;t play due to the death of Wabash&#x27;s star halfback, Ralph Lee Wilson, who died from a concussion in a game earlier in the season. The schools have played each other every year since 1911. The 2020 game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

==Monon Bell Classic==
The Monon Bell Classic is an American college football rivalry game played by Wabash College and DePauw University. Named for the Monon Bell, the trophy awarded to the winner, it is the sixth most-played Division III rivalry and equals the 12th-most played in college football. To date, there have been 130 total games played between the two teams, resulting in a lead for Wabash at 63-58-9.

Since the Bell was introduced as the rivalry&#x27;s prize in 1932, Wabash holds a slimmer 44-42-6 advantage.

The game has received national media coverage including articles in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1973 and 1993, a feature on Charles Kuralt&#x27;s 1979 &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; show, articles in &quot;USA Today&quot; in 1987 and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1999 and a feature on Fox Sports Net&#x27;s show &quot;The Slant&quot; in 1999.

The game is regularly televised and past battles have been seen on ABC, ESPN2, AXS TV, and Fox Sports.

Annually, alumni parties are held in more than 50 cities across America where loyal fans from both schools gather to watch the game. Professionally replicated DVDs have been produced of 22 complete contests—the 2000 through 2017 games, as well as the 1977, 1984, 1993 and 1994 Monon Bell Classics.

In 2008, Ken Owen &#x27;82, executive director of media relations at DePauw, completed the task of compiling a &quot;Monon Memory&quot; for each and every game in the rivalry series. The clips utilize video/film from the DePauw and Wabash archives, as well as vintage photographs, and are available online and on Monon Bell DVDs. The &quot;Memories&quot; project was the subject of coverage in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Inside Indiana Business, and other media outlets. Owen has since re-cut several of the segments after locating additional archival materials.

Listed below are the all-time Monon Bell Classic results, with Wabash victories shaded in scarlet and DePauw victories are shaded in old gold.

==Bell heists==

The Bell has been stolen at least nine times (1941, 1959, 1965, 1966, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1988, 1998). The most famous theft is known as &quot;Operation Frijoles,&quot; which was ranked by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as one of the five greatest all-time rivalry pranks. &quot;Operation Frijoles&quot; is still the favorite story shared by Wabash fans regarding the &quot;reappropriation&quot; of the 300-pound trophy claimed each November by either Wabash College or DePauw University in the annual football meeting.

===Operation Frijoles===

Prior to the 1965 meeting between the two teams, Wabash student Jim Shanks &#x27;67 scheduled a meeting with DePauw University President William H. Kerstetter, claiming to be representative from the US Information Service in Mexico City. During the meeting with Kerstetter, Shanks was able to convince the president to offer two full scholarships for Mexican students. To &quot;seal the deal&quot; Shanks asked to take photos of various points of interest on campus to show the &quot;prospective&quot; Mexican students more about DePauw University.

One item Shanks asked to photograph was the Monon Bell, in the Tigers&#x27; possession after a 22–21 victory in 1964. The dean of the college was the only person on campus who knew the location of the Bell, but was reluctant to tell Shanks of its location. &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether I should show this to you or not,&quot; he said with a laugh. &quot;The last time I showed it to someone, they stole it.&quot;

Taken to the second floor of a Quonset hut near the football field, Shanks took careful notes that were reviewed by Wabash students upon his return. The Wabash students decided they would have two groups attempt to retrieve The Bell. The first group that arrived on campus was quickly discovered before attempting the heist and were ordered to either &quot;leave campus or find dates.&quot; The Wabash students chose the latter. The second group of students arrived on campus undetected, entered the building, and took the Bell back to Crawfordsville. Depauw&#x27;s security, upon realizing The Bell was gone, found the first group of Wabash students still on campus. Security questioned the students about the heist but their dates vouched that they had been together the entire night. The Bell was eventually &quot;found&quot; by the Wabash administration and returned to DePauw the day before the 1965 game.

Saturday afternoon the Little Giant football team made certain it was a short visit. Wabash defeated DePauw 16–6. After every Wabash touchdown, the Wabash fans cheered &quot;Ole!&quot; At the conclusion of the game Wabash fans stormed the field, many wearing sombreros and ponchos, throwing tortillas onto the field and wielding posters congratulating President Kerstetter for the loss of the Bell and the two scholarship offers.

===Other heists===
Another famous heist saw DePauw students stealing the bell from themselves. In 1967, concerned about the safety of the Bell from Wabash kidnappers, a group of DePauw students stole the bell from its resting place and buried it in the north end zone of DePauw&#x27;s Blackstock Stadium. Very few students knew of its location, and many mistakenly believed it had been kidnapped by Wabash students. Shortly after the heist, the temperature dropped well below freezing and there was concern The Bell would inaccessible for the game. Luckily, the ground thawed and The Bell was unearthed on game day. Wabash wound up leaving with the trophy after a 7–0 victory on the muddy turf.

The Bell was last stolen in 1998 by Wabash students on Halloween.

In 1998, after DePauw had secured the Bell, a fracas broke out on the field of Wabash&#x27;s Byron P. Hollett Little Giant Stadium and DePauw students pulled down one of the Little Giants&#x27; goal posts. The Little Giant student body retaliated by charging the field. The melee was broken up by the local police, which used pepper spray to restrain the visiting crowd. As a result, following Monon Bell Classics have been played with added security and segregated fan sections along with transferring The Bell midway through the 4th quarter to a neutral location if the result of the game is still in doubt.

===Failed heists===
One other failed heist occurred by DePauw students. They had succeeded in stealing the bell and had the bell loaded into their car when their car wouldn&#x27;t start. They were caught red-handed with the bell. They assumed that they would only get a slap on the wrist for the attempted heist. However, because the crime occurred in Montgomery County, where nearly all the judges are Wabash alumni, the students from DePauw got 1000 hours of community service.

In 2012, DePauw students nearly snatched the bell when several members of the Wabash fraternity Sigma Chi fell asleep guarding it, however they woke up when the bell accidentally rang. In the resulting melee, the handle to the bell was broken, but Wabash was able to retain it.

In October 2017, three Wabash students wearing masks of Barack Obama and Donald Trump attempted to steal the bell from its display case at DePauw&#x27;s Lilly Center in what is now known as the Failed Bipartisanship Heist. The students were intercepted on their way to a getaway truck after a DePauw police officer noticed the vehicle with its engine running during fall break; the would-be bandits also triggered a hidden pressure sensor, which alerted the DePauw and Greencastle City Police. Out of concern for the students&#x27; future employment prospects, the police, the schools, and the students agreed the students only punishment would be cleaning Blackstock Stadium after the game. Many Wabash alumni and other students assisted the clean-up following the game to lighten the burden on the apprehended students.

==The Ballad of the Monon Bell==
The Ballad of the Monon Bell was introduced the week of the 1985 game at DePauw. The music is by Nancy Ford Charles (DePauw 1957), and the lyrics are by Darel Lindquist (DePauw 1968). The concept of the ballad originated with Patrick Aikman (DePauw 1957). The ballad has been recorded by Jim Ibbotson (of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) (DePauw 1969). A video, originally created in 1985, was recut in 2007 after tape was found containing a stereo version of the song, and another new version was created in August 2012. A 1985 demo of the song was also found in 2009. &quot;(See external links below for an MP3 and MOV of the song.)&quot;

&quot;Long before the cannonball traveled through her towns&quot;
&quot;The state of Indiana owned the jewel of the crown&quot;
&quot;The train, they called the Monon, the stories they still tell&quot;
&quot;The Giants and the Tigers playing for her bell&quot;

&quot;It rode like a masthead on engine ninety-nine&quot;
&quot;Crawfordsville to Greencastle, then further down the line&quot;
&quot;The Giants came from Wabash, the Tigers from DePauw&quot;
&quot;Since eighteen-ninety they have played the last game ev’ry fall&quot;

&quot;Many years they played for pride, oh the stories they could tell&quot;
&quot;Then in thirty-two the Monon train gave up her precious bell&quot;
&quot;They said, &quot;Here take this symbol of smoke and fire and grit&quot;
&quot;And give it to the winner, a symbol not to quit.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;
&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;

&quot;Suddenly the boys of autumn had fire in their eyes&quot;
&quot;Blood and spit, but never quit, fighting for the prize&quot;
&quot;The medal to the victor, the symbol to the school&quot;
&quot;Wabash and DePauw became a yearly duel&quot;

&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;
&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;

&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;
&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;

&quot;Now history has recorded the players and their games&quot;
&quot;And to this day they still play for the Bell in Monon’s name&quot;
&quot;Those who’ve gone before return each November day&quot;
&quot;Swapping stories and legends for those who did not play&quot;

&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;
&quot;Ring the Bell for Wabash, ring for old DePauw&quot;
&quot;Ring the bell for victory in the last game ev’ry fall&quot;

<text>Pirkanmaa (; ; ), also known as &quot;Tampere Region&quot; in government documents, is a region of Finland. It borders the regions of Satakunta, South Ostrobothnia, Central Finland, Päijät-Häme, Kanta-Häme and Southwest Finland. Most of the water area in the Kokemäki River watershed is located in the Pirkanmaa region, although Lake Vanajavesi is partly in the Kanta-Häme region. The region got its name from Pirkkala, which in the Middle Ages comprised most of present-day Pirkanmaa. Tampere is the regional center and capital of Pirkanmaa, and at the same time the largest city in the region.

The total population of Pirkanmaa was 529,100 on 30 June 2022, which makes it the second largest among Finland&#x27;s regions after Uusimaa. The population density is well over twice the Finnish average, and most of its population is largely concentrated in the Tampere metropolitan area.

== History ==

Pirkanmaa has been inhabited for thousands of years. In the Bronze Age, agriculture replaced hunting, and in the Iron Age a settlement stretched from Eurajoki to Längelmäki, which was Finland&#x27;s northernmost area of peasant culture from the 8th century. In the 11th century, the settlement was concentrated along River Kokemäenjoki and Lake Pyhäjärvi. In the 14th century, present-day Pirkanmaa was part of the historical Satakunta, the main part of which was Upper Satakunta and a small part of which was also Lower Satakunta. After the wilderness period, the absence of towns slowed down development. King Gustav III founded Tampere in 1775, and in the 1840s it became Finland&#x27;s most important industrial centre. New inventions such as sawdust, cellulose and papermaking boosted development. Industries were established in Valkeakoski, Nokia and Mänttä, among others. Tampere became the centre of the province and a railway junction.

During the Finnish Civil War, Pirkanmaa was under the control of the Reds and Tampere was the centre of the Reds. After the war, industrialisation intensified. During the Winter War, Tampere and other cities were bombed. The County of Pirkanmaa was established in 1956. The county was also called &quot;Tammermaa&quot;, but gradually &quot;Pirkanmaa&quot; became the name of the region. In the 1950s, the only city in the province was Tampere, but from 1963 to 1977 the municipalities were made into cities. The number of municipalities decreased in the second half of the 20th century, and old place names were reintroduced as municipalities merged. In 1994 Finland was divided into 20 functional economic provinces, and Pirkanmaa was one of them.

== Regional division ==
=== Historical provinces ===
== Municipalities ==

The region of Pirkanmaa consists of 23 municipalities, 12 of which have city status (marked in bold).

=== List of municipalities ===

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 18.3 billion € in 2016, accounting for 8.5% of Finnish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €36,040 or 92% of the EU27 average in the same year. Pirkanmaa&#x27;s GDP was the second highest among the regions and the seventh highest among the nineteen regions per capita.

The economic structure of Pirkanmaa typically focuses on services for post-industrial society. A nationally significant ICT concentration has grown in Tampere. Thanks to its population base, the city is also a major trading center. Industry&#x27;s share of value added and jobs in Pirkanmaa is higher than the Finnish average. The region is one of Finland&#x27;s main centers of manufacturing, has a long tradition of industrial activity and a good education network. The industry is largely concentrated in Tampere and its surroundings, such as towns of Nokia and Valkeakoski. Mänttä-Vilppula is also a major industrial center. Agriculture accounts for a small share of economic activity. In the western part of the region, agricultural production is dominated by dairy cattle, in the south by cereals, and in the north by forestry.

== Language ==

Pirkanmaa is a rather linguistically homogeneous region: in 2018, almost 490,000 people, or about 95 per cent of the county&#x27;s population, spoke Finnish as their mother tongue. For Finno-speakers, the national population share of Pirkanmaa was 10,1 per cent. In the 2010s, the number of Finnish-speakers has increased only in Uusimaa, Pirkanmaa and Northern Ostrobothnia, and slightly in Southwest Finland and Åland.

The Swedish-speaking settlement settled in Finland in the Middle Ages did not extend to the area of present-day Pirkanmaa, so the number and share of Finno-Swedes in the province is small. In 2018, about two thousand people spoke Swedish as their mother tongue in Pirkanmaa. In 2017, 27 people spoke Sámi as their mother tongue in Pirkanmaa. The second most spoken language in Pirkanmaa is Russian, in 2018 it was used by four thousand people as their mother tongue.

== Regional council ==
The regional council is the main governing body for region and focuses primarily on urban planning. Like all regional councils, it is mandated by law.

== Politics ==

<text>The Arcadian Court is an Art Deco event space in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the eighth floor of the flagship downtown Toronto location of the Canadian department store The Bay at Yonge and Queen Streets. For many years, it was an exclusive restaurant, then an art gallery, then closed and used for storage. It was restored and is now used as an event space.

The facility first opened in 1929, when the store was part of the Simpson&#x27;s chain. The Arcadian Court was intended to compete with the Royal York Hotel&#x27;s Imperial Room, the Georgian Room at the main Eaton&#x27;s store, and the Eaton&#x27;s Seventh Floor on College Street (now called The Carlu) for downtown lunch business. The Court was two stories in height, the main floor and a mezzanine (called &quot;The Men&#x27;s Grill&quot; from 1968–1969), which was men-only for many years. The restaurant&#x27;s architecture featured wrought iron railings, arched windows, and huge chandeliers. Three skylights allow light to enter the whitewash hall interior. At its opening, it was the largest department store restaurant in the world, seating 1,300. The restaurant hosted many of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s first radio broadcasts, and in 1967, it hosted the first auction ever held outside Britain by Sotheby&#x27;s.

In 1978, Simpson&#x27;s was acquired by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and subsequently became downtown Toronto&#x27;s flagship Bay store in 1991. From 1988 to 1989, some of the mezzanine space was converted to gallery space, which displayed the Canadian art collection of Kenneth Thomson. Much of the second floor of the Arcadian Court was closed off or used for the storage of chairs. A small pictorial display and a cast-iron fountain is located outside the hall. This gallery space was closed in 2004, and the Thomson collection was transferred to the Art Gallery of Ontario and now displayed as the Thomson Collection.

Reopened in May 2012, the Arcadian Court is now a part of a larger event complex (which now includes the neighboring Arcadian Loft) called &quot;Arcadian&quot;, which is operated by Oliver &amp; Bonacini Events. The renovations were carried out by architecture firm DeSignum Design. The renovations have stripped back layers of walls and flooring that have been added over the years, reclaiming approximately of the perimeter. The arches were also restored. Eight of the 16 grand arches in the mezzanine that were closed off in past renovations were reopened and the squared-off arches were restored. The renovations added in height to the remaining eight. The Court is now with improved acoustics, new chandeliers that are a deconstructed take on the original Lalique crystal chandeliers and an opened-up mezzanine.

The &quot;Arcadian Court&quot; name has been carried on as a brand name for other restaurants operated in Bay stores, though none are as opulent or exclusive as the Toronto original was. The Arcadian Court also figures prominently in Margaret Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;, as the center of Toronto&#x27;s high society to which Iris Chase Griffen is introduced. On November 18, 2022, Trinity College at the University of Toronto hosted its 85th annual Saints Ball at the Arcadian Court, a prestigious philanthropic event that supports a different charitable cause every year.

<text>Corio Bay is one of numerous internal bays in the southwest corner of Australia&#x27;s Port Phillip, and is the bay on which abuts the City of Geelong. The nearby suburb of Corio takes its name from Corio Bay.

==Etymology==
When Hamilton Hume and William Hovell arrived at the bay in 1824 they met with the local Wautharong people who referred to the bay as &quot;Jillong&quot; and the surround land &quot;Corayo&quot;, but by the time the area was surveyed in the late 1830s the Aboriginal names had been swapped. The names &quot;Corayo&quot; and &quot;Jillong&quot; had since been Anglicised to &quot;Corio&quot; and &quot;Geelong&quot;.

==Shipping==

The Port of Geelong is located on the shores of Corio Bay, and is the sixth largest port in Australia by tonnage.

Before the initial settlement of Geelong, a sandbar across the bay from Point Lillias to Point Henry prevented ships from entering the inner harbour. Ships were required to drop anchor in the bay, and cargo was brought into Geelong on small barges. At times it was possible to walk across the bay on the sandbar at low tide.

The first channel through the sandbar was started in 1853, providing less than 4 metres draught for ships. This channel was straightened out and dredged at a depth of 6 metres in the 1860s. In 1881 a new channel started that took 12 years to complete. It was named the Hopetoun Channel after Lord Hopetoun who opened it on December 20, 1893.

Management of the channels and port was the responsibility of the Geelong Harbour Trust that was formed in December 1905. In 1981, the Port of Geelong Authority took over from the trust. The authority was privatised by the State Government in mid 1996, being sold to TNT Logistics for $49.6 million. It was later re-branded as &#x27;GeelongPort&#x27;.

==Leisure==
The shores of Corio Bay have been a popular playground for Geelong residents. Since the 1930s Eastern Beach has been a popular swimming location. Boating is also popular, with a number of public boat ramps and piers provided. The bay is also the home of the Royal Geelong Yacht Club that was established in 1859, and the adjacent Bay City Marina that was constructed in the 1980s. Sometimes, whales and dolphins can be seen in the bay.

== Commercial fishing ==
Commercial net fishing in Corio Bay ended in 2018 after campaigning by recreational fishing groups.

== Contamination ==
Industrial activity around Corio bay has resulted in pollution to the bay:

* In 1974, severe cadmium contamination of mussels from Corio Bay was reported. Levels as high as 41.5 μg/g had been found. The Corio Bay contamination was traced to an industrial effluent which later ceased. After that time, cadmium levels in Corio Bay mussels decreased to below the NH&amp;MRC limits.
*Lead levels were significantly high in mussels in Corio Bay in 1977-78 and remained above the maximum permitted concentration of 2.5 μg/g up to the last measurements made prior to 1992
*In 2002, Shell Australia was fined for three separate oil spills into Corio Bay.
*In 2003, Shell refinery had 63 spills to the bay up until September 8 of that year.
*in 2004 Shell Australia was ordered to pay $75,000 towards an environmental project near its Geelong refinery after it was convicted of polluting Corio Bay during three oil spills in 2003.
*In 2009 Shell Australia was fined over oil leaks into bay and on land.
*In 2014, spills of 3500 litres and 6300 litres of an ammonia derivative chemical (diisopropylamine) used in oil refining by Viva Energy from the bayside oil refinery occurred.
* In 2016, Incitec Pivot was fined twice for illegally discharging about 1.7 million litres of treated wastewater and untreated stormwater into Corio Bay.
* In 2015, Impact Fertilisers was fined for two illegal discharges of contaminated liquid. During its investigations EPA found out that a second discharge had occurred. It is likely that this second discharge would have reached Corio Bay.
* In 2017, Midway Limited was fined for permitting a significant amount of contaminated water, the company&#x27;s third spill in 12 months, to leave its site and enter Corio Bay.

<text>Henry Timrod (December 8, 1828 – October 7, 1867) was an American poet, often called the &quot;Poet of the Confederacy&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Timrod was born on December 8, 1828, in Charleston, South Carolina, to a family of German descent. His grandfather Heinrich Dimroth emigrated to the United States in 1765 and anglicized his name. His father, William Henry Timrod, was an officer in the Seminole Wars and a poet himself. 
The elder Timrod died from tuberculosis on July 28, 1838, in Charleston, at the age of 44, leaving behind his wife of 25 years, Thyrza Prince Timrod, and their four children, the eldest of which was Adaline Rebecca, 14 years; Henry was nine. A few years later, their home burned down, leaving the family impoverished.

He attended a classical school where he befriended Paul Hamilton Hayne, his lifelong friend and fellow poet who would edit Timrod&#x27;s work after he died. He then studied at the University of Georgia beginning in 1847 with the help of a financial benefactor. He was soon forced by illness to end his formal studies, however, and returned to Charleston. He took a position with a lawyer and planned to begin a law practice. From 1848 to 1853, he submitted a number of poems to the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; under the pen name &quot;Aglaus&quot;, where he attracted some attention for his abilities. He left his legal studies by December 1850, calling it &quot;distasteful&quot;, and focused more on writing and tutoring. He was a member of Charleston&#x27;s literati, and with John Dickson Bruns and Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, could often be found in the company of their leader, William Gilmore Simms, whom they referred to as &quot;Father Abbot,&quot; from one of his novels.

===Career===

In 1856, he accepted a posting as a teacher at the plantation of Colonel William Henry Cannon in the area that would later become Florence, South Carolina. Cannon had a single-room school building built in 1858 to provide for the education of the plantation children. The building measures &quot;only about twelve by fifteen feet in size.&quot; Among his students was the young lady who would later become his bride and the object of a number of his poems – the &quot;fair Saxon&quot; Kate Goodwin. While teaching and tutoring, he continued also to publish his poems in literary magazines. In 1860, he published a small book, which, although a commercial failure, increased his fame. The best-known poem from the book was &quot;A Vision of Poesy&quot;.

===Civil War period===
With the outbreak of American Civil War, in a state of fervent patriotism, Timrod returned to Charleston to begin publishing his war poems, which drew many young men to enlist in the service of the Confederacy. His first poem of this period is &quot;Ethnogenesis&quot;, written in February, 1861, during the meeting of the first Confederate Congress at Montgomery, Alabama. Part of the poem was read aloud at this meeting:

&quot;A Cry to Arms&quot;, &quot;Carolina&quot; and &quot;The Cotton Boll&quot; are other famous examples of his war poetry. He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Russell&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and to &quot;The Southern Literary Messenger&quot;.

During this period, Timrod’s poetry received inspiration from Sophie Augusta Sosnowski, who taught German and music at the Barhamville Institute and was the daughter of Sophie Wentz Sosnowski. Even after Sosnowski married a Confederate officer in 1863 and Timrod married Kate, the two couples maintained a cordial relationship.

On March 1, 1862, Timrod enlisted into the military as a private in Company B, 20th South Carolina Regiment, and was detailed for special duty as a clerk at regimental headquarters, but his tuberculosis prevented much service, and he was sent home. After the bloody Battle of Shiloh, he tried again to live the camp life as a western war correspondent for the Charleston &quot;Mercury&quot;, but this too was short lived as he was not strong enough for the rugged task.

He returned from the front and settled in Columbia, South Carolina, to become associate editor of the &quot;South Carolinian&quot;, a daily newspaper. Throughout 1864 he wrote many articles for the paper. In February 1864 he married his beloved Katie, and they soon had a son, Willie, born on Christmas Eve.

This happy period in his life was short-lived. General Sherman&#x27;s troops invaded Columbia on February 17, 1865, one year and one day after his marriage. Timrod and his colleague Julian Selby printed the last issues of the &quot;South Carolinian&quot; as shells were falling nearby. Due to the vigor of his editorials, he was forced into hiding, his home was burned, and the newspaper office was destroyed.

===Death===
The aftermath of war brought his family poverty and, to him and his wife, increasing illness. He moved his family into his sister and mother&#x27;s home in Columbia. Then, his son Willie died on October 23, 1865. He expressed his sorrow in the poem &quot;Our Willie&quot;:

He took a post as correspondent for a new newspaper based in Charleston, &quot;The Carolinian&quot;, but continued to reside in Columbia. Even after several months of work, however, he was never paid, and the paper folded. In economic desperation, he submitted poems written in his strongest style to northern periodicals, but all were coldly declined. Henry continued to seek work, but continued to be disappointed. Finally, in November, 1866, he was given an assistant clerkship under Governor James L. Orr&#x27;s staff member James S. Simons. This lasted less than a month, after which he was again dependent on charity and odd jobs to feed his family of women. Despite the harshly reduced circumstances, and mounting health problems, he was still able to produce highly regarded poetry. His &quot;&quot;, composed in the Spring of 1867 &quot;was sung at Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, in May when the graves of the southern dead were decorated.&quot;

He finally succumbed to consumption Sunday morning, October 7, 1867, and was laid to rest in the churchyard at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbia next to his son.

==Criticism and legacy==

Timrod&#x27;s friend and fellow poet, Paul Hamilton Hayne, posthumously edited and published &quot;The Poems of Henry Timrod&quot;, with more of Timrod&#x27;s more famous poems in 1873, including his &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Cotton Boll&quot;.

Later critics of Timrod&#x27;s writings, including Edd Winfield Parks and Guy A. Cardwell, Jr. of the University of Georgia, Jay B. Hubbell of Vanderbilt University and Christina Murphy, who completed a Ph.D. dissertation on Timrod at the University of Connecticut, have asserted that Timrod was one of the most important regional poets of 19th-century America and one of the most important Southern poets. In terms of achievement, Timrod is often compared to Sidney Lanier and John Greenleaf Whittier as poets who achieved significant stature by combining lyricism with a poetic capacity for nationalism. 

Today, Timrod&#x27;s poetry is included in most of the historical anthologies of American poetry, and he is regarded as a significant—though secondary—figure in 19th-century American literature. From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, allegedly, comes the appellation of Timrod as &quot;the poet laureate of the South&quot;--though that claim comes from a review published years after Tennyson&#x27;s death.

In 1901, a monument with a bronze bust of Timrod was dedicated in Charleston. The state&#x27;s General Assembly passed a resolution in 1911 instituting the verses of his poem &quot;Carolina&quot; as the lyrics of the official state anthem.

In September 2006, an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted similarities between Bob Dylan&#x27;s lyrics on the album &quot;Modern Times&quot; and the poetry of Timrod. A wider debate developed in &quot;The Times&quot; as to the nature of &quot;borrowing&quot; within the folk tradition and in literature.

<text>Business casual is an ambiguously defined Western dress code that is generally considered casual wear but with smart (in the sense of &quot;well dressed&quot;) components of a proper lounge suit from traditional informal wear, adopted for white-collar workplaces. This interpretation typically includes a dress shirt and trousers, but worn with an odd-coloured blazer or a sports coat instead. Neck ties are optional in this category.

Acceptance of business casual in the United States was preceded by Casual Fridays which originated in California in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the Hawaiian 1960s casual custom of Aloha Friday. The designation of particular clothing pieces as &quot;business casual&quot; may be contentious.

==Definition==
There is no generally agreed definition of &quot;business casual&quot;. One definition states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The &quot;Dress for Success&quot; advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as &quot;a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,&quot; which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that &quot;it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.&quot;

Another author wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that &quot;Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie.&quot; 

A BBC article in 2011 suggested that a &quot;safe global standard&quot; consists of &quot;a button down shirt,&quot; &quot;jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes.&quot; It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries. A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look &quot;clean and well-groomed.&quot;

A contributor to &quot;Forbes&quot; asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: &quot;For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear.&quot; A response to that was &quot;I disagree. No khakis.&quot; She states that &quot;there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet.&quot;

<doc id="536970" wikidata="Q1142526" url="?curid=536970" title="Spectral bat">
<text>The spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum), also called the great false vampire bat, great spectral bat, American false vampire bat or Linnaeus&#x27;s false vampire bat, is a large, carnivorous leaf-nosed bat found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is the only member of the genus Vampyrum; its closest living relative is the big-eared woolly bat. It is the largest bat species in the New World, as well as the largest carnivorous bat: its wingspan is . It has a robust skull and teeth, with which it delivers a powerful bite to kill its prey. Birds are frequent prey items, though it may also consume rodents, insects, and other bats.

Unlike the majority of bat species, it is monogamous. Colonies consist of an adult male and female and their offspring. The adult male will bring food back to the roost to provision the adult female and their offspring. Colonies generally roost in tree hollows, though individuals may roost in caves. Due to habitat destruction and its low population density, it is listed as a near-threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The spectral bat was described in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus. The holotype was collected in South America by Daniel Rolander. Linnaeus assigned it to the genus &quot;Vespertilio&quot;, which he classified as a kind of primate. Its species name &quot;&quot; is from Latin meaning &quot;apparition&quot; or &quot;specter&quot;.

The genus &quot;Vampyrum&quot; was not described until 1815 by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. The genus and species names were not used in their current combination until biologist George Gilbert Goodwin did so in 1942. &quot;Vampyrum&quot; is a Neo-Latin derivative of vampire, thus named because it was once erroneously believed that the species was sanguivorous and consumed blood.
Based on mitochondrial DNA and the RAG2 gene, the spectral bat is most closely related to the monotypic genus &quot;Chrotopterus&quot; (the big-eared woolly bat).

&quot;Vampyrum&quot; and &quot;Chroptopterus&quot; diverged from other leaf-nosed bat species approximately 20.75 million years ago, with the two genera diverging from each other 14.35 million years ago. The spectral and big-eared woolly bats likely evolved from an insectivorous ancestor.

The spectral bat is included within the subfamily Phyllostominae, which includes species of diverse feeding strategies, including carnivory, insectivory and mixed insectivory/frugivory. The spectral and big-eared woolly bats are the two extant members of the tribe Vampyrini. Vampyrini additionally includes the extinct genus &quot;Notonycteris&quot;. Based on dental characteristics, Czaplewski and Morgan additionally included the fringe-lipped bat (genus &quot;Trachops&quot;) and sometimes the round-eared bats (genus &quot;Lophostoma&quot;) in Vampyrini.

==Description==
The spectral bat is the largest bat species native to the New World and the largest carnivorous bat in the world.
The wingspan typically ranges from . Its forearm length is .
Its body length is and its mass is . Its wings, though large in an absolute sense, are short relative to its body size. The wings are wide, though, creating a large surface area. Its wingtips are rounded and almost squarish. The thumbs are long, at .
Each of its thumbs has a large, recurved claw that is grooved, similar to those of cats. Its back fur is reddish-brown, long, and soft, while its belly fur is shorter and paler. The forearm is furred on the half closer to the body, but naked on the half closer to the wrist and fingers.
Its molars are narrow with W-shaped crests. While six of its molars have three cusps, as in many mammal species, the last upper molars are reduced to two cusps; they are much smaller than the other molars. The talonids (crushing surfaces) of the molars are small relative to their trigonids (shearing surfaces). The upper canine teeth are well-developed. Its dental formula is for a total of 34 teeth. Its skull is narrow and elongated with a pronounced sagittal crest. Overall, its skull resembles a miniature canid or bear skull. Its nose-leaf is large, at in length. There is no discernible tail, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is long and broad. Its legs are long, and the feet are composed of slender bones; each digit has a well-developed claw. The ears are large and rounded, at long.

The brain is large relative to the body; at 1:67, its brain-to-body mass ratio is higher than that of cats and dogs. The cerebral hemispheres of the brain are extensively convoluted. The brain has well-developed olfactory bulbs and its cerebellum is the most ornamented and complex of any member of its subfamily. McDaniel described its corpus callosum and white matter as &quot;exceptionally thick&quot;.

==Biology and ecology==
===Diet===

The spectral bat is exclusively carnivorous, consuming birds, rodents, and other species of bat. Additionally, it consumes some insects such as beetles. It preys on other bats opportunistically, and it is known to eat bats out of researchers&#x27; mist nets. Prey species include the highland yellow-shouldered bat, Geoffroy&#x27;s tailless bat, Pallas&#x27;s long-tongued bat, short-tailed fruit bats, the common vampire bat, and fruit-eating bats. It was once thought to supplement its diet with fruit, but a captive pair refused to eat any fruit over a 5-year period. Its diet can be studied passively because it carries prey items back to its roost to consume, discarding unwanted parts such as bird feathers, bat wings, and rodent tails. Over the course of a year, 18 bird species were identified from feathers left under a roost in Costa Rica: based on the assemblage, it prefers non-perching bird species that weigh . However, a later study in Brazil determined that perching bird species were a majority of prey items.

Doves and cuckoos are frequently consumed—they represented over half the prey items documented in the Costa Rican study. Some prey species such as cuckoos, trogons, and motmots are known to have a strong odor, leading Vehrencamp et al. to hypothesize that spectral bats may rely on scent to locate prey. It also prefers prey that roost in groups, which may aid in detection. The groove-billed ani, which both has a strong smell and roosts in groups, is a particularly common prey item, representing approximately 24-26 of the 86 prey items identified in the study. Other species identified included the orange-fronted parakeet, orange-chinned parakeet, rufous-naped wren, streak-backed oriole, and scissor-tailed flycatcher. The largest prey species identified was the white-tipped dove, which at , weighs almost as much as spectral bats. Because its prey items can be so large, it may only need to consume one bird every two or three nights to meet its caloric requirements. 

===Foraging===

The spectral bat uses echolocation to navigate, creating short pulses of ultrasound at relatively low frequencies; its echolocation characteristics are suited for maneuvering around obstacles while flying low to the ground. Its foraging style has been compared to owls; it likely uses its agile and maneuverable wings to hover as it plucks prey items off the ground or tree branches. It stalks the prey and then lands on it from above, securing the prey by hooking it with its sharp thumb claws. It kills its prey by delivering a forceful bite to the skull. Relative to its size, its bite force is stronger than any Carnivoran. Its bite force is predicted to measure 80–100 Newtons based on its body size and canine teeth characteristics. It has been recorded as being attracted to the distress calls of smaller bats while hunting.

In a study of the wing morphology of 51 Neotropical bat species, the spectral bat had the lowest wing loading (body mass to wing area ratio) at 20.05. Low wing loading is advantageous for carnivorous bats because it allows them to pick up prey items from the ground and fly with them. Its wing structure allows it to take flight in confined spaces and to carry heavy prey items, despite the bat&#x27;s size. Males will carry prey back to their roosts to provision females and their pup.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
The spectral bat is one of an estimated 18 species of bat which are monogamous. Additionally, it is one of two known species of bat where the males provide parental care, the other being the yellow-winged bat. Males have relatively small testes—as a monogamous species, there is not generally sperm competition, so males can save energy by producing less sperm.

It is a seasonal breeder, with females giving birth at the end of the dry season or the beginning of the rainy season. The litter size is one individual, with offspring called &quot;pups.&quot; The mother is reportedly very attentive and gentle with her offspring. The male is often in attendance as well and will frequently sleep with both the female and their young completely wrapped up in his wings.
The extent of natural depredation upon spectral bats is unknown, but spectral bat remains were once documented in a western barn owl pellet in Oaxaca, Mexico.

Spectral bats roost independently or in small colonies of up to five individuals in hollow trees. An examination of one colony of five individuals consisted of an adult male and female, a nursing pup, and a juvenile male and female. The juvenile male was estimated to be six months old; he was presumed to be the older offspring of the adults, while the female was also possibly their offspring. Though it was initially believed to only roost in trees, it was first documented using a cave as a roost in 2008. Its average lifespan is unknown; however, it is believed that the same individual roosted in a cave from 2008 until at least 2016 based on a unique ear pigmentation, making lifespans of at least 8 years possible. In captivity, one adult individual of uncertain initial age was maintained for 5.5 years.

==Range and habitat==
The spectral bat is found in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It has been documented at elevations from above sea level, though in Mexico it is only found in lowland areas of below . It is associated with tropical rainforests. In 2010, the species was documented for the first time in the Cerrado of Brazil. It is occasionally encountered in pastures and orchards.

==Conservation==
As of 2018, the spectral bat is classified as near threatened by the IUCN. Its population size is difficult to assess, as it is rarely encountered. However, its population trend is assessed as decreasing. It may be intentionally persecuted by humans. In Trinidad, the bats are sometimes thought to be ghosts, and locals will seek out and destroy their roosts.

As of 1999, the spectral bat is listed as endangered in Bolivia. It has been listed as an endangered species in Mexico since 2001.

<text>Ladysmith, originally Oyster Harbour, is a town located on the 49th parallel north on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The local economy is based on forestry, tourism, and agriculture. A hillside location adjacent to a sheltered harbour forms the natural geography of the community.

, the population was 8,990. The area of the town was 12.04 square kilometres. Total private dwellings were 4,079. Population density was 746.5 people per square kilometre.

Ladysmith is served by the coast-spanning Island Highway, the Island Rail Corridor, nearby Nanaimo Airport and BC Ferries.

== History ==
James Dunsmuir founded Ladysmith about 1898, a year after he built shipping wharves for loading coal at Oyster Harbour (now Ladysmith Harbour) from the mine at Extension, nearer Nanaimo. Dunsmuir, owner of coal mines in the Nanaimo area, needed a location to house the families of his miners. He chose to build the community at what was then known as Oyster Harbour, some 20 miles (32 km) south of his Extension mines. Many buildings were moved from Extension and Wellington by rail and by oxen.

In 1900, Dunsmuir renamed the town in honour of the British lifting the siege of Ladysmith in South Africa (28 February 1900) during the Second Boer War. (The original town of Ladysmith in turn took its name from Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith, known as Lady Smith, the Spanish wife of Sir Harry Smith, the British Governor of the Cape Colony and high commissioner in South Africa from 1847 to 1852.) The Town of Ladysmith was incorporated June 3, 1904.

Dunsmuir thought this would be a fitting tribute at the conclusion of the Boer War (which ended in 1902). In addition to commemorating the end of the war by naming his town after Ladysmith, Dunsmuir also chose to name the streets of the community after British military personnel including: Field Marshall Lord Roberts, General John French, General Redvers Buller, General Sir Charles Warren, General Sir George White, Horatio Herbert Kitchener, Lieutenant-General Sir William Forbes Gatacre, Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, Major General Lord Methuen, and Sir William Penn Symonds. The local high school yearbook was at one time called Spion Kop (&quot;spy hill&quot; in Afrikaans), in commemoration of the Battle of Spion Kop, a famous engagement in January 1900 in which the Boers defeated British troops during the Second Boer War.

Ladysmith experienced significant unrest and violence during the Vancouver Island coal miners&#x27; strike of 1912–1914. The miners were striking because of a variety of long-standing safety concerns. During the strike, militia were dispatched to put down unrest and protect property.

The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada first saw active service in the summer of 1912 when rallies by striking coal miners in the area around Nanaimo led to rioting. A company from the Seaforths was sent to garrison the area. Order was eventually restored and maintained until the unit was called back to mobilize for war in August 1914.

In 2017, Ladysmith&#x27;s historic First Avenue was named the best street in Canada by the Canadian Institute of Planners.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ladysmith had a population of 8,990 living in 3,926 of its 4,079 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 8,537. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Ladysmith included:
*Irreligion (5,255 persons or 59.7%)
*Christianity (3,335 persons or 37.9%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (40 persons or 0.5%)
*Judaism (30 persons or 0.3%)
*Sikhism (30 persons or 0.3%)
*Buddhism (25 persons or 0.3%)
*Other (80 persons or 0.9%)

=== Ethnicity ===
== Media ==
The &quot;Ladysmith-Chemainus Chronicle&quot;, a weekly community paper on Vancouver Island with a circulation of 1,898, has been printed locally and was founded in 1908. It is circulated in the communities of Ladysmith and Chemainus, in central Vancouver Island. It is archived online in the Google news archive.

== Education ==
Ladysmith Secondary School is the only secondary school in Ladysmith. The area has three elementary schools: Ladysmith Primary School (Kindergarten to Grade 3), Ladysmith Intermediate School (Grade 4 to Grade 7), and École North Oyster Elementary (Kindergarten to Grade 7). École North Oyster Elementary is a dual-track school, having both French immersion and English programs. Davis Road Elementary School (Kindergarten to Grade 7) was open from 1963 until June 2014 when it was closed due to being over capacity.

== Business ==
The Syfy original series &quot;Resident Alien&quot; is largely filmed within the town of Ladysmith. During production, many of the town&#x27;s residents are employed as background performers. The town is transformed into the show&#x27;s fictional setting of Patience, Colorado. Showrunner Chris Sheridan stated that production of the series is the subject of much attention and that residents often attempt to glean spoilers based on the observations of filming, leading certain scenes to be filmed at night. He furthermore detailed that while the filming does create disruptions such as the temporary closures of streets, the show&#x27;s crew makes every effort to be as respectful as possible.

<text>In law, a dwelling (also known as a residence, abode or domicile) is a self-contained unit of accommodation – such as a house, apartment, mobile home, houseboat, recreational vehicle, or other &quot;substantial&quot; structure – used as a home by one or more households. The concept of a dwelling has significance in relation to search and seizure, conveyancing of real property, burglary, trespass, and land-use planning.

==Legal definitions==
Legal definitions vary by jurisdiction.

===&#x27;Dwelling&#x27; (England and Wales)===
Under English law, a dwelling is defined as a self-contained &#x27;substantial&#x27; unit of accommodation, such as a building, part of a building, caravan, houseboat or other mobile home. A tent is not normally considered substantial.

===&#x27;Dwelling&#x27; (North Carolina)===
According to North Carolina General Statute § 160A-442, &quot;Dwelling&quot; means any building, structure, manufactured home or mobile home, or part thereof, used and occupied for human habitation, or intended to be so used, and includes any outhouses and appurtenances belonging thereto or usually enjoyed therewith, except that it does not include any manufactured home or mobile home, which is used solely for a seasonal vacation purpose.&quot;

According to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 53-244.030, &quot;Dwelling&quot; means a residential structure that contains one to four units, whether or not that structure is attached to real property. The term includes an individual condominium unit, cooperative unit, manufactured home, mobile home, or trailer if it is used as a residence. Under the Oregon law, a &quot;dwelling&quot; is defined as a &quot;building which regularly or intermittently is occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present.&quot; The United States v. Adams, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 25866 (9th Cir. Or. 25 November 2009)

===&#x27;Habitual residence&#x27; (international law)===
In international conventions, a person can have only one habitual residence, being the place where the individual ordinarily resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places for a reasonably significant period of time. It is used to determine the law which should be applied to determine a given legal dispute. The Hague Conference on Private International Law has deliberately refrained from offering a definition so that the concept may be flexible and adaptable to practical requirements.

===&#x27;Inhabited dwelling&#x27; (various US states)===
In California, California Penal Code § 246 refers to the discharging of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house. This statute specifies that a &quot;dwelling&quot; (more commonly referred to as a house) is &quot;inhabited&quot; if a person lives in it; it is irrelevant whether anyone is present. A house, building, or structure is not considered &quot;inhabited&quot; or &quot;occupied&quot; if the occupants have moved out or vacated and do not intend to return, even if the personal property was left behind. Therefore, it would no longer be considered a dwelling for legal purposes, which from a defense standpoint, would negate a conviction under this code. For prosecutors, it is advantageous to construe these terms loosely in order to secure as many convictions as possible for violation of this code. Examples of loose interpretation exist not only in California but also in other states such as Colorado where a similar statute (Colorado Code § 18-1-901(3)(g)) applies in cases even when a shooting at a detached garage that does not traditionally constitute a dwelling or house. However, per common law, courts in both of these states and others have held that it does qualify as an occupied building for purposes of a criminal conviction.

===The &#x27;curtilage&#x27; (boundary) of a dwelling===

In law, the curtilage of a dwelling is the land immediately surrounding it, including any closely associated buildings and structures. It delineates the boundary within which a homeowner can have a reasonable expectation of privacy with particular relevance to search and seizure, conveyancing of real property, burglary, trespass, and land use planning. In urban properties, the location of the curtilage may be evident from the position of fences, walls, and similar; within larger properties, it may be a matter of some legal debate as to where the private area ends and any &quot;open fields beyond&quot; begin.

<doc id="536999" wikidata="Q258028" url="?curid=536999" title="Birżebbuġa">
<text>Birżebbuġa (; sometimes shortened to B&#x27;Buġa) is a seaside town in the Southern Region of Malta, close to Marsaxlokk. It is approximately from the capital Valletta, and has a population of 9,736 as of March 2014.

The town is popular among Maltese holidaymakers, and is known for its sandy beach, Pretty Bay. The village is also notable for its important archaeological sites, especially Għar Dalam, Ta&#x27; Kaċċatura and Borġ in-Nadur.

==Etymology==
&quot;Birżebbuġa&quot; means &quot;well of olives&quot; in the Maltese language. Such linguistic evidence established early inhabitants were in the south of the island since the first millennium. The name also indicates climate and food.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Near the village of Birżebbuġa is &quot;Għar Dalam&quot;, meaning a dark cave. Għar Dalam Cave is a highly important site, as it was here that the earliest evidence of human presence on Malta was discovered. Artefacts date back to the Neolithic Period some 7,400 years ago. The display area consists of two parts: the cave and the museum, which exhibit a remarkable wealth of finds from animal bones to human artefacts. An overlaying river running at right angles formed the cave. It is some 144 metres deep, but only the first fifty metres are open to visitors.

The lowermost layers, more than 500,000 years old, contain the fossil bones of dwarf elephants, hippopotami, micro-mammals and birds. Above the pebble layer is the so-called ‘deer’ layer, dating to around 18,000 years ago. The top layer dates to less than 10,000 years and holds evidence of the first humans on the Island. Experts hold that these remains suggest that the Islands were once a land bridge to continental Europe.

Other remains include those of a prehistoric temple or settlement, Borġ in-Nadur, which dates from the Bronze Age. The settlement was fortified with a large stone wall, still visible today. These temple ruins are important because they reveal not only a four-apse temple (c.2000 BC), but an authentic, fortified Bronze Age domestic settlement. The remains of a large, defensive wall lie nearby, running across the head of a promontory between two valleys leading down to two bays. The wall was built facing inland. The village would have had the sea to its back. This logistic situation leads scholars to believe that the people living in the village were more afraid of being attacked by invaders by land rather than from the sea.

Traces of Bronze Age huts were discovered lying just behind the wall. The depth of the deposits was very shallow, covering the remains of the Temple Period. Archaeologists have found evidence that shows that the Neolithic population became extinct and the islands were uninhabited. Archaeologists think that this could have been due to no agricultural produce, civil warfare, or the Neolithic population being murdered by war-like tribes. Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of the three apses (semi-circular rooms) of the temple. Beyond the main entrance, there is a wide elliptical area about 25 m long and 15 m wide. Only the Trilithon Entrance remains. Visits to these sites can be arranged by appointment.

Birżebbuġa also has cart ruts that lead into the sea and run along the sea floor. A Roman villa can be found across the valley from Għar Dalam, at Ta&#x27; Kaċċatura.

===Modern history===
In addition to prehistoric sites, the town includes historical structures and remains that date back centuries, revealing changing peoples as the island went through different periods of domination by various political interests. Such structures include Ferretti Battery, Pinto Battery, and the Birżebbuġa entrenchments. These sites date back to the rule of the Order of Saint John, who ruled the Maltese islands from 1530 to 1798. Napoleon ejected the Order from Malta, and later the island came under the control of Great Britain.

During the British period, Fort Benghisa, RAF Kalafrana and RAF Hal Far were built in Birżebbuġa.

Churches tell part of the history of the town: 
* St George&#x27;s Church (1575, reopened in 1683). In the earth nearby are traces of prehistoric cart ruts.
* the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, 
* the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception, Bengħisa (1822, enlarged in 1862),
* the Holy Family Chapel (1865),
* the Chapel of Our Lady Help of Christians (1839), private; 
* St Joseph’s Chapel (1871), private; and
* the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows (1909), which served as the parish church until 1938. Birżebbuġa became a formal parish on 9 September 1913, with a resident priest. Some time later, the parish worked to build a larger church. St. Peter in Chains opened for worship on 12 June 1938. The present parish priest is Rev. Can. Fr Anton Galea-Scannura.

A monument in Birżebbuġa commemorates the Malta Summit, which took place close by on 3 December 1989.

During the last decade, there has been an influx of new workers employed at the nearby Malta Freeport and container terminal. In addition, new residents have come from the neighbouring villages, Birzebbuġa now hosts some 10,000 people.

The town is built around the beach, which puts it close to many shops and restaurants along the coastline. Some vacationers prefer the rocky shore in the neighbouring St George&#x27;s Bay, ideal for sunbathing and snorkelling. Sailing is popular throughout the year. St George&#x27;s Bay is also used by local fishermen who moor their boats at the inlet. St George&#x27;s Bay is famous for the cart ruts that go across the small sandy bay.

==Transport==

To get to Birzebbuga from Valletta you will have to board either the 82, 80 or X4 bus. The X4 passes every 30 minutes to Birzebbuga, 80 every hour and 82 passes every 15 minutes during the rush hour and 20–30 minutes at other times.

There are two other routes that pass from Birzebbuga; route 210 which travels to and from Mater Dei Hospital and the University of Malta; and route 119 which travels through Birzebbuga and ends at the Malta International Airport and Marsascala.

==Coat of arms==
Birżebbuġa&#x27;s coat of arms shows a blue chevron and olive branch on a white field. The blue represents the nearby waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the olive branch the major importance of olives to the local economy, in former times.

==Sports==
The locality hosts a number of football teams. Birżebbuġa St. Peter&#x27;s F.C. currently compete in Group A of the Maltese National Amateur League (after a merging of the now defunct Maltese Second Division and the Maltese Third Division), after languishing at the bottom of Maltese football for years. The highest tier Birzebbugia St. Peter&#x27;s has played in was the Maltese First Division. The club was promoted to this division in 2010, due to a league expansion, but was subsequently relegated in 2015. As well as its Seniors&#x27; team, the club also possesses a prosperous nursery which is run by Birzebbuga Windmills FC.

Birzebbuga St. Peters&#x27; is also in a collaboration with a newly founded futsal team, Birzebbuga St. Peters&#x27; FC Futsal, which is competing in the Maltese Futsal Fourth Division Section A . Apart from these clubs, an amateur football team is also present, Birzebbuga Tigers FC.

Birzebbuga also has its own water polo team, Birzebbuga A.S.C. (also known as Birzebbugia Freeport), which plays in the Maltese Waterpolo First Division.

Furthermore, Birzebbuga has its own &#x27;Boċċi&#x27; club, which competes in the Second Division of the Maltese Bocci Federation League.

<text>The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD or UT Dallas) is a public research university in Richardson, Texas, United States. It is the northernmost institution of the University of Texas System. It was initially founded in 1961 as a private research arm of Texas Instruments.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. It is associated with four Nobel Prizes and has members of the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering on its faculty with research projects including the areas of Space Science, Bioengineering, Cybersecurity, Nanotechnology, and Behavioral and Brain Sciences. UT Dallas offers more than 140 academic programs across its seven schools and hosts more than 50 research centers and institutes.

While the main campus is officially under the city jurisdiction of Richardson, one-third of it is within the borders of Dallas County. UTD also operates several locations in downtown Dallas – this includes the Crow Museum of Asian Art in the Arts District as well as multiple buildings in the Medical District next to UT Southwestern: the Center for BrainHealth, the Center for Vital Longevity, and the Callier Center for Communication Disorders.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===

Before the founding of the University of Texas at Dallas, Eugene McDermott, Cecil Howard Green and J. Erik Jonsson had purchased Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI) on December 6, 1941 – the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor. With the rapid increase in defense contracts due to declaration of war with Germany, the General Instrument Division of GSI grew substantially and was later reorganized under the name Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) in 1951.

The increase in defense contracts also created a shortage in the Dallas–Fort Worth area of the qualified personnel required by TI. At the time, the region&#x27;s universities did not provide enough graduates with advanced training in engineering and physical sciences. Texas Instruments was forced to recruit talent from other states during its expansion, and the founders observed in 1959 that &quot;To grow industrially, the region must grow academically; it must provide the intellectual atmosphere, which will allow it to compete in the new industries dependent on highly trained and creative minds.&quot;

To compensate for a shortage, McDermott, Green, and Jonsson established the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest on February 14, 1961. While the institute initially was housed in the Fondren Science Library at Southern Methodist University, a nearby empty cotton field was later acquired by Jonsson, McDermott, and Green in Richardson, Texas in 1962. The first facility, the Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Science (later named the Founders Building), opened in 1964. The Graduate Research Center of the Southwest was renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS) in 1967.

On June 13, 1969, Texas governor Preston Smith signed House Bill 303, which added the institution to the University of Texas System as the University of Texas at Dallas (effective September 1, 1969). When Texas Instruments and UTD co-founders officially bequeathed the young university to the UT System, they boldly stated that they envisioned it would one day become the “MIT of the South.” At the time, the college only accepted graduate students for Masters and PhD programs – no undergraduate Bachelor degree programs were offered. Francis S. Johnson served as initial interim president before Bryce Jordan was selected in 1971.

=== Expansion and growth ===

In July 1971, Bryce Jordan became the university&#x27;s first president and served until 1981. At that time the campus consisted of only one facility (the Founders Building) and only admitted graduate students. During Jordan&#x27;s 10-year tenure the university received of land in 1972 from the Hoblitzelle Foundation. This allowed the campus to expand with the addition of a number of new facilities, including most notably the Cecil H. Green Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, and a campus bookstore. The school received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1972, and the first diplomas were awarded in 1973.

The first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded in spring 1976. The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the UTD in 1975 and the School of Management opened in 1975. Enrollment increased from 700 in 1974, to 3,333 in 1975, and later to more than 5,300 students in 1977.

UT Dallas&#x27;s first Nobel laureate, the late Polykarp Kusch, was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982.

The first art installation, the &quot;Love Jack&quot; by Jim Love, was added to UTD&#x27;s campus in 1976. The Visual Arts Building opened in 1978.

Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the Rutford Ice Stream and Mount Rutford in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982. He served in this post until 1994. During his tenure as president, the university secured approval for a school of engineering, added freshmen and sophomores to its student body, and built the first on-campus housing.

The school became a four-year institution in fall 1990. The initial incoming freshman class was about 100 students. The state mandated that admission criteria for entering freshmen &quot;to be no less stringent than the criteria of UT Austin&quot;.

Franklyn Jenifer became the third president of UT Dallas in 1994 and served until 2005. During that time, UT Dallas&#x27;s enrollment increased over 61% – from less than 8,500 to nearly 14,000.

Parts of the university&#x27;s ceremonial mace have been brought into space. A steel band in the headpiece and the metal foot of the staff fashioned from a scientific instrument designed by the UT Dallas Space Sciences Institute and were flown aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor in September 1995.

The Galerstein Women&#x27;s Center opened in 1996. It was renamed the Galerstein Gender Center and then dismantled in 2023 after the passing of SB17.
In June 2005, David E. Daniel was appointed the university&#x27;s fourth president. He previously served on the faculty at UT Austin and was the Dean of Engineering at the University of Illinois from 2001 to 2005. He has continued the expansion of the campus by adding the Natural Science and Engineering Research Laboratory, the Center for BrainHealth (near the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), and almost 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) of new facilities added from 2007 to 2010.

The first fight song was written in September 2008; it was written to the music of &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;.

=== Attempted DFW area UT System mergers ===

In July 2001, the 77th Texas legislature failed to pass two proposed bills which had very different plans for the future of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex UT System intuitions.

The first plan, 77(R) HB 3568 proposed by Kenn George, would have consolidated the 2 universities and 1 medical school under the name &quot;The University of Texas at Dallas&quot;. It would have established UT Dallas (UTD) in Richardson, TX as the main flagship campus, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW) as its medical school, and would have designated UT Arlington (UTA) as a UT Dallas satellite campus (a situation similar to UT Rio Grande Valley). The purpose of the bill was to consolidate all DFW UT System institutions into one, creating single cohesive flagship-level university for the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. However, the bill was unpopular with supporters of UT Arlington (because they wanted to retain their identity as a separate institution from UT Dallas) and the House Bill ultimately failed to pass. Despite this, UT Dallas has continued a close relationship with UT Southwestern. UT Dallas&#x27; Center for BrainHealth and Callier Center were built right next to UTSW&#x27;s main campus in downtown Dallas. Additionally, UT Southwestern later established a Clinical Center in Richardson next to UTD&#x27;s main campus.

The second plan, 77(R) HB 3607 proposed by Domingo Garcia, would have transferred UT Dallas, UT Southwestern, and UT Arlington to the University of North Texas System (to create something similar to the University of Houston System). The Denton, TX campus would have remained as the flagship university while the 3 Dallas–Fort Worth UT System institutions would have been designated as separate degree-granting sister UNT System colleges. Their names would have changed to the &quot;&quot;University of North Texas at Dallas&quot; located in Richardson, TX (not to be confused with the present-day UNTD campus established later in 2009), the &quot;University of North Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas&quot; (UNTSW), and the &quot;University of North Texas at Arlington&quot;&quot; (UNTA). The law was left pending due to objections from both UT Arlington and UT Dallas, as both preferred to remain under the UT System.

=== Recent history ===

On July 15, 2016, Richard C. Benson was appointed the fifth president of the University of Texas at Dallas. Previously he was Dean of the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech, which saw record growth from 2005 to 2016 after the number of engineering applicants nearly doubled during his tenure. He has continued the expansion of the UTD campus with the addition of The Bioengineering and Sciences Building, The Engineering &amp; Computer Science West Building, a new Science Building, The Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center, and Northside Phase 1 &amp; 2 (the first on-campus apartments with first floor retail space).
In 2018, the university inherited the Barrett collection of Swiss art which will be housed in a new building as part of the Edith O&#x27;Donnell Institute of Art History. In January 2019, the family of Trammell and Margaret Crow donated the entire collection of the Crow Museum of Asian Art to The University of Texas at Dallas, along with $23 million in support funding to help build a structure on the university campus to show more of the artworks.

In fall 2019 UT Dallas marked its 50 years as a Texas public university (est. 1969), 44 years of undergraduate junior/senior enrollment (since 1975), 29 years of incoming freshmen enrollment (since 1990), and 58 years as a research center (founded in 1961).

In April 2023, University of Texas at Dallas students protested the Israel-Hamas war and genocide. They staged a sit-in and setup an encampment, joining other campuses across the USA. The students  demanded that the university divest from companies that contribute weapons to the war. The university administration called in riot police to forcibly remove the encampment and there were 17 arrests. UTD students were charged with trespassing on UTD land and threatened with disciplinary action.

On July 20, 2023, UT Dallas announced that it would leave the American Southwest Conference and transition to become an NCAA Division II school in the Lone Star Conference.

On August 26, 2024, UT Dallas President Richard C. Benson announced plans to step down from his position as the fifth president of the university. The UT System Board of Regents will conduct a national search for his replacement over the course of the 2024–25 academic year and he will remain in his role until a successor begins their term.

In September 2024, the student newspaper &quot;The Mercury&quot; website was shut down by the administration and the editor removed, allegedly in retaliation for criticism of UTD actions against the pro-Palestinian protesters earlier in the year.

== Academics ==
As of 2024, UTD had an 8-year student graduation rate of 70% for its undergraduate students seeking a bachelor&#x27;s degree, compared to the national median of 58% for 4-year universities. This is the third-highest student graduation rate for public universities in Texas, behind the 82% student graduation rates of UT Austin and Texas A&amp;M.

=== Rankings ===
In 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in &quot;Best Colleges&quot; ranked UTD at tied for 109th among national universities. The &quot;2017 Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; placed UTD at 71st–99th in the United States. &quot;Washington Monthly&#x27;s 2015 Annual College and University Rankings&quot; placed UTD at 99th in the United States. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance magazine&#x27;s 100 Best Values in Public Colleges 2016&quot; ranked UTD at 33rd in value for in-state residents and 38th for out-of-state students.

=== Colleges and schools ===


For fall 2021, the University of Texas at Dallas offered 146 academic programs across its seven schools including 56 baccalaureate programs, 59 master&#x27;s programs and 31 doctoral programs. The school also offers 33 undergraduate and graduate certificates. The school offers a number of interdisciplinary degree programs.

In July 2022, UTDallas announced it would combine the School of Arts &amp; Humanities with the School of Art, Technology and Emerging Communications (ATEC) to form the School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology (AHT) effective August 22, 2022.

The seven schools of UT Dallas for fall 2024:

* Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities and Technology 
* School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences
* School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences

=== Student body ===
The top majors among undergraduates are computer science; arts, technology, and emerging communication; computer information systems and technology; biology; finance; psychology; business administration; neuroscience; mechanical engineering; and healthcare studies. Undergraduate students comprise 69% of the student body, while graduate students comprise 31%. The majority of graduate students (61.57%) are international students, compared to only 4.43% of undergraduate students being international students.

In the fall 2022–23 academic year, UTD enrolled 227 National Merit Scholars in its freshmen class of 4,220, which was the highest total number in Texas and one of the highest in the nation. The fall 2017 entering freshmen class had an average SAT composite score of 1323 and an average ACT composite score of 29. These freshman SAT/ACT scores are the highest averages in UTD&#x27;s history – which surpassed Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s and matched UT Austin&#x27;s averages of that year. For the 2022–2023 academic year, the university granted 5,227 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 3,788 master&#x27;s degrees and 250 doctoral degrees for a total of 9,265 degrees.

=== Scholarship programs ===
All freshmen admitted to the university are automatically considered for an Academic Excellence Scholarship (AES) Award. For the fall 2017 incoming freshmen class, the awards range from $3,000 per year for tuition and mandatory fees up to complete coverage of UT Dallas tuition and mandatory fees plus $3,000 per semester cash stipend to defray the costs of books, supplies and other expenses.

The McDermott Scholars Program, established at UT Dallas in 2000, provides full scholarships and unique cultural and civic opportunities to academically talented high school students.

The National Merit Scholars Program, established at UT Dallas in 2011, provides admission to the Collegium V Honors college, full tuition and mandatory fees, and an additional stipend.

In 2006, UT Dallas became one of 13 universities in Texas affiliated with the Terry Foundation Scholarship. The Terry Scholars Program is a cohort experience that offers academic, cultural, service, mentoring, and other unique opportunities to traditional and transfer students awarded the prestigious scholarship.

=== Research ===
UT Dallas is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and had research expenditures of $140 million for the 2022 fiscal year, $60 million of which came from federal fundings. Research projects include the areas of space science, bioengineering, cybersecurity, nanotechnology, and behavioral and brain sciences. The university has more than 50 research centers and institutes and the UTD Office of Technology Commercialization, a technology transfer center.

The William B. Hanson Center for Space Studies (CSS), affiliated with the Department of Physics, conducts research in space plasma physics. It has its roots in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Laboratory of the university&#x27;s predecessor. The center conducts a NASA-sponsored mission, Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI), which was launched in April 2008 in cooperation with the United States Air Force. CINDI, which is part of the payload for the Communication and Navigation Outage Forecast System program, seeks to uncover information about the equatorial plasma bubbles that interrupt radio signals. Under the leadership of John H. Hoffman, the center designed the mass spectrometer for the Phoenix Mars Lander as part of the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) experiment in cooperation with the University of Arizona.

UT Dallas conducts cybersecurity research in a number of areas including cross-domain information sharing, data security and privacy, data mining for malware detection, geospatial information security, secure social networks, and secure cloud computing. The university is designated a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research for the academic years 2008–2013 by the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security.

The Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute was established in 2001 when Bay Baughman, a pioneering nanotechnologist, became the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Chemistry and director of the university&#x27;s NanoTech Institute. In 2007, it was renamed in memory of the late Alan G. MacDiarmid, who shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Alan Heeger and Hideki Shirakawa. The NanoTech Institute has produced more than 200 refereed journal articles, 13 of which have been published in &quot;Science&quot; or &quot;Nature&quot;, and given over 300 lectures in the United States and abroad. Ray Baughman was ranked number 30 on the March 2, 2011, Thomson Reuters list of the top 100 materials scientists. 

The Natural Science and Engineering Research Laboratory (NSERL), a four-story, research facility, was completed in December 2006 after two years of construction. Including ISO 7 cleanroom facilities, the $85 million building provides open floor plans that allows chemists, biologists, nanotechnologists, materials scientists and other specialists to conduct multidisciplinary research. The laboratory provides extensive wet lab, fabrication, instrumentation, and high performance computing facilities to foster biomedical engineering and nano-technology research. The Nanoelectronics Materials Laboratory, on the fourth floor, includes a system that allows researchers to deposit thin film materials one atomic layer at a time. In May 2011 a $3 million JEOL ARM200F scanning transmission electron microscope with an atomic resolution of 0.78 picometers, was added to the research laboratory, already home to two transmission electron microscopes.
The Center for BrainHealth, both its own facility and part of the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, is a research institute with clinical interventions focused on brain health. The center is located near the UT Dallas&#x27; Callier Center for Communication Disorders and adjacent to the north campus of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the city of Dallas. Brain research is concentrated on brain conditions, diseases, and disorders including, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, autism, dementia, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and working memory.

The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences). Research, at the center, includes the causes, prevention, assessment and treatment of communication disorders and the facilities include laboratories for research in child language development and disorders, autism spectrum disorders, speech production, hearing disorders, neurogenic speech and language, cochlear implants and aural habilitation.

Additional ongoing research initiatives at UT Dallas include researchers overseeing the long-running British Election Study (BES). Harold Clarke, the Ashbel Smith professor of political science in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, and Marianne Stewart, professor of political science are the co-principal investigators for the study, which began in 1964 and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest continuous political research projects. The other two co-investigators are David Sanders and Paul Whiteley of the University of Essex in England.

== Campus ==

=== Main campus ===
The main campus is located in Richardson, Texas. Portions of that campus extend into Dallas. The main campus is next to Dallas&#x27;s Telecom Corridor, north of downtown Dallas, on the boundary of Dallas and Collin counties. UT Dallas owns land in Richardson, Texas consisting of approximately for campus development and another adjacent to the campus. &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s Guide to 332 Green Colleges: 2014 Edition&quot; recognized UTD for their green campus efforts.

While the main campus&#x27; address is officially within the jurisdiction of Richardson and Collin county, approximately one-third of the college today (one-half in 1969) is physically located within the border of Dallas county (which the city of Dallas typically governs). This section contains major areas in the south end of campus, including the Visitor Center, Bookstore, the Naveen Jindal School of Management, Athletics District and facilities, half of the Founders Building, parking lots, and some on-campus student housing (Canyon Creek and University Village buildings 1, 2, and 3). When UT Dallas started growing in the 1960s, the university needed to coordinate with one of the cities for water, electricity, sewer, police, and fire services. Dallas agreed to let Richardson officially host the university because it did not have the ability or capacity to support UTD at the time (a situation similar to SMU and University Park). Today, UT Dallas and Richardson share a close relationship and have strongly supported each other&#x27;s growth for the past 50 years.

=== Other locations ===
* Waterview Science &amp; Technology Center and the Research and Operations Center, a leased building, is adjacent to the main campus and officially within Dallas city limits.
* Callier Center, consisting of 8 buildings, and the Center for BrainHealth, a single building, is adjacent to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the city of Dallas.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 19, 2022, to officially launch CENT-IQ that will be home to five multi-disciplinary research centers.
*The Athenaeum, a cultural district on the UT Dallas campus, opened its first phase in September 2024. It features a new home for the Crow Museum of Asian Art and a performance hall, establishing a significant arts and cultural hub for the university.
*TI Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building: Dedicated on October 26, 2023, this 150,000-square-foot facility is located on the East Campus of UT Southwestern. Funded by a $120 million donation from Texas Instruments, it features advanced lab spaces and collaboration areas, aiming to enhance biomedical innovation and training at UT Dallas and UT Southwestern.

=== Architecture ===

The first campus development plan (1971) called for brutalist-style concrete architecture, a monorail, and skywalks. While not everything was implemented, some of the original elements outlined do remain today. The overall modern look and feel of the campus was inspired by the founders&#x27; vision of a &quot;college of the future&quot; – intentionally straying far from the traditional &quot;red-brick&quot; styles of older universities.

Later architecture (early 21st century) exhibits late modern or postmodern features such as bronze glass, bronze aluminum frames, unadorned geometric shapes, unusual surfaces, and unorthodox layouts. This styling is seen in the Engineering and Computer Science West building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles). To provide protection from inclement weather and extreme temperatures, many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of elevated indoor walking paths also referred to as skybridges.

The Student Services building, completed in 2010, is the first academic structure in Texas to be rated a LEED Platinum facility by the United States Green Building Council.

=== Landscape ===

A $30 million Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, largely funded by Margaret McDermott (wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott), was started in October 2008 and completed in late 2010. The project encompassed all aspects of landscape architecture from campus identity to pedestrian strategies, future growth patterns, sustainability and establishing a campus core. The first enhancement included the reforestation of the main entry drive with more than 5,000 native trees. Each tree was hand-picked and individually arranged by the landscape architect after study of native stands in Texas.

The next major enhancement included the commitment to a riparian corridor, consisting of a densely planted natural creek bed along the central entry median to the campus Allée. The main Mall (or &#x27;Allée&#x27;) includes 116 hand-picked columnar &#x27;Claudia Wannamaker&#x27; Magnolias alongside five reflecting pools and four human-scale chess boards (to represent the achievements of the school&#x27;s chess team). At the northern terminus of the Mall (between the McDermott Library and the Student Union) is a pavilion-sized plaza, referred to by many students as &quot;The Plinth&quot;. The plaza includes a granite fountain complete with mist column, an overhead trellis covered in wisteria vines, and a temperature-modifying shade structure design.

The most recent Phase of the Campus Landscape Enhancement Project was completed in time for the fall 2021 semester. This phase included converting a section of Rutford Ave from North Loop Road to Franklyn Jenifer Drive into a 24-foot wide pedestrian-only promenade. Six brick signs matching that of the main entrance was also installed at major intersections and campus entrances. A bridge was also installed over Cottonwood Creek between Callier Center Richardson and the Bioengineering and Sciences Building which was finished in September 2021. A total of 1,200 trees were planted and enhancements were made to the Rock Garden behind the Founder Building.

=== Art museum ===
In November 2018, the university announced the donation of the Barrett Collection of Swiss Art, the largest collection of Swiss art outside of Switzerland. Shortly after, in January 2019, the family of Trammell and Margaret Crow, local real estate mogul, donated the entire collection of the Crow Museum of Asian Art to The University of Texas at Dallas, along with $23 million in support funding to help build a structure on the university campus to show more of the artworks. This donation was a decade in the making by the Director of the Center for Asian Studies and Dean of the then School of Arts and Humanities, Dennis M. Kratz.

With the need to build an art museum to hold these vast collections, Richard Brettell, founding director of the Edith O&#x27;Donnell Institute of Art History and major orchestrator of the two acquisitions, was heavily involved in the design process, which was designed by the Los Angeles-based architecture firm Morphosis, which is also designed the renowned Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Downtown Dallas

Located south of the Naveen Jindal School of Management and close to the main entrance of the university, groundbreaking for the two story 68, 459 sq ft Edith and Peter O’Donnell Jr. Athenaeum began on May 11, 2022, and is expected to be completed by 2024. The project is expected to cost $58 million, with around 55% of the cost being funded through university gifts. Upon completion, the Athenaeum will be the largest major art museum north of I-635.

=== Greek life ===
The University of Texas at Dallas opened the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life in 1992 with Kappa Sigma and Alpha Gamma Delta as the first fraternity and sorority on campus, respectively. Internal sources state that more than 1,000 students are involved in 26 Greek organizations as of fall 2019.

=== Student media ===
&quot;The Mercury&quot; has been the official student newspaper of the University of Texas at Dallas since 1980. It publishes 5,000 copies every other Monday during the fall and spring semesters, and every third Monday during the summer. It is distributed free around campus and at the UTD newsroom in the Student Union. &quot;The Mercury&quot; also publishes online at utdmercury.com. In April 2011, &quot;The Mercury&quot; won 12 awards at the 101st annual Texas Intercollegiate Press Association IPA convention. In September 2024, &quot;The Mercury&quot;&#x27;s editorial board, management team, and staff went on strike to protest the removal of Gregorio Olivares Gutierrez as Editor-in-Chief of &quot;The Mercury&quot; and to demand his reinstatement by UTD&#x27;s Student Media Operating Board.

In 2004, another student print named &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; (&quot;AMP&quot;) was formed. In contrast to &quot;The Mercury&quot;, which is almost all news articles, &quot;AMP&quot; is a magazine and features mostly editorial content. &quot;AMP&quot; is published once a month, eight times a year. Any student, faculty, or staff of UTD can contribute to the paper. Copies of &quot;AMP&quot; are available for free at the first of each month around the campus, and can also be downloaded in PDF format from their website. &quot;Radio UTD&quot; is the university&#x27;s student-run, online-only, radio station.

In 2009, UTD TV, an internet-based campus TV station, was founded and launched by students. It webcasts a range of student-interest programs from campus news and amusing serial stories to student affairs coverage.

=== Residential housing ===
On-campus housing for the 2015–2016 academic year consisted of the University Commons five residential halls and 1,237 apartments. The apartment buildings 1–37, which make up 696 units and buildings 38–67, which make up 541 units, are owned by the university and privately managed by American Campus Communities under the name University Village. Buildings 1–37, previously known as the Waterview Park Apartments, were owned by the Utley Foundation and purchased by UTD on July 1, 2013. Apartment floor plans vary from 1-bedroom to 4-bedroom units and amenities include swimming pools, volleyball courts, outdoor grills, and study centers. According to a &quot;UTD Mercury&quot; article on September 18, 2011, both graduate and upperclassman housing continues to be in short supply due to the increase in enrollment.
On August 12, 2009, a residence hall (Residence Hall South) opened, providing housing for 384 full-time freshmen residents and 16 peer advisers. The building includes a mix of three-bedroom, single-bath suites for freshmen and one-bedroom, one-bath units for peer advisers. On each wing and each floor are several communal study areas and the ground floor features a glass-enclosed rotunda with pool and ping-pong tables, large-screen televisions, couches and chairs. A second, residence hall, (Residence Hall North), was officially completed June 27, 2011, and a third freshman residence hall (Residence Hall Northwest) adjacent to the two existing halls was completed in August 2012. A fourth residence hall (Residence Hall Southwest) opened in time for the fall 2013 semester. Construction for a fifth residential facility (Residence Hall West) was started in July 2013 and completed in 2014. The 339,000-square-foot (31,500 m2) 600-bed facility includes a dining hall with seating for 800 and a recreation center. Residence Hall West houses the Living Learning Communities program that groups students with similar interests and majors together.

Construction has begun on two new apartment-style housing complexes known as Phase VI and Phase VII. The two complexes will offer a total of 800 beds and are expected to open in time for the fall 2017 semester.

In 2015, co-developers Balfour Beatty Campus Solutions and Wynne/Jackson began construction of a private mixed-use development known as Northside on leased university land directly adjacent to the main campus. Opened in time for the fall 2016 semester, the development offers 600 beds through a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments and townhomes. Northside also includes 20,000 square feet of space for retail and food vendors, bringing an integrated residential and retail complex to the edge of campus for the first time.

=== Dining ===
Students have multiple dining options, including commercial restaurants primarily within the Student Union, a traditional dining hall near the residence halls, and convenience stores within buildings. Commercial restaurants include Firehouse Subs, Chick-fil-A, Smoothie King, Halal Guys, Panda Express, Starbucks, and Einstein Bros. Bagels. The Student Union dining hall opened on August 12, 2009, in conjunction with the opening of the first residence hall and was later replaced by a new dining hall within the Residence Hall West complex. The former Student Union dining hall was later replaced by an extended food court area featuring an expanded Chick-fil-A and a Panda Express, among other options. The Student Union building houses The Pub which features a sit-down restaurant atmosphere. Beginning in the fall 2016 semester, UT Dallas Dining began hosting local food trucks on campus. All first-year students living on campus are required to purchase a meal plan; meal plans are optional for all other students who live on campus.

== Traditions ==
The student body is collectively known as the Comets, while the college&#x27;s mascot is Temoc. The &quot;Whoosh&quot; salute is a way for students to show campus unity.

Resting in front of the Texas Instruments Plaza is the sculpture &quot;Jack&quot;, created in 1971 by artist Jim Love (1927–2005). Margaret McDermott, wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott (1899–1973), presented the sculpture to the university in 1976.

=== Spirit Rocks ===
The Spirit Rocks were a set of three &quot;free speech&quot; rocks on campus where students could paint anything following loose rules. The rocks were painted frequently with political, event-related, and school spirit messages.

On October 16, 2023, student newspaper The Mercury reported on students spray painting Palestinian and Israeli flags and messages on the Spirit Rocks in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. Students painted various messages in support of both countries, including &quot;WE (Israel) ARE WINNING&quot;, &quot;Free Palestine&quot;, &quot;END OCCUPATION&quot;, &quot;Terror ≠ &#x27;Justice&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Zionism = Nazism&quot;. Dean of Students Amanda Smith said the support for both countries did not violate the rules of the Spirit Rocks. CBS Texas reported on the issue, calling the Spirit Rocks &quot;a tense platform for politics with competing views about the violence in the Middle East&quot;.

On November 20, the Spirit Rocks were removed by Student Affairs executives for platforming &quot;extended political discourse&quot; without consulting the committee responsible for university policies. This sparked backlash from the student body, prompting protests attended by hundreds of students. Free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression condemned the University for the Spirit Rocks&#x27; removal.

== Athletics ==
UT Dallas is transitioning to NCAA Division II varsity athletics. It has competitive club teams and intramural sports teams. Athletic teams are known as the Comets, while the mascot is Temoc (&quot;Temoc&quot; is &quot;comet&quot; spelled backwards.)

=== Varsity ===
The University of Texas at Dallas&#x27; Varsity athletics program started when UTD provisionally joined the NCAA Division III and the American Southwest Conference (ASC) in 1998 and was granted full membership in the ASC in 2002. On July 20, 2023, the university announced it would move to NCAA Division II and join the Lone Star Conference. Varsity sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, esports, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. In total, there are 300 student athletes and 14 intercollegiate teams officially supported by the university.

Gene Fitch, the university’s vice president of student affairs stated that UTD plans to open &quot;the premier collegiate gaming center in the country&quot; by spring of 2025.

=== Intramural sports ===
UT Dallas has several intramural sports teams. These teams compete only within UTD, as all teams are organized groups of current students. While available sports and teams can vary each year, teams offered in spring 2019 included: Badminton, Basketball, Battleship, Cricket, Esports, Flag Football, Sand Volleyball, Swim, Soccer, Table Tennis, Tennis, Ultimate Frisbee, Wiffleball, Rock Climbing and Xtreme Dodgeball.

<text>The Gondi (Gōṇḍī) or Gond people, who refer to themselves as &quot;Kōītōr&quot; (Kōī, Kōītōr), are an ethnolinguistic group in India. Their native language, Gondi, belongs to the Dravidian family. They are spread over the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha. They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe for the purpose of India&#x27;s system of reservation.

The Gond have formed many kingdoms of historical significance. Gondwana was the ruling kingdom in the Gondwana region of India. This includes the eastern part of the Vidarbha of Maharashtra. The Garha Kingdom includes the parts of Madhya Pradesh immediately to the north of it and parts of western Chhattisgarh. The wider region extends beyond these, also including parts of northern Telangana, western Odisha, and southern Uttar Pradesh.

Gondi is claimed to be related to the Telugu language. The 2011 Census of India recorded about 2.4 million speakers of Gondi as a macrolanguage and 2.91 million speakers of languages within the Gondi subgroup, including languages such as Maria (also known as Maadiya Gond). Many Gonds also speak regionally dominant languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Odia, and Telugu.

According to the 1971 census, the Gondi population was 5,653,422. By 1991, this had increased to 7,300,998, and by 2001, the figure was 8,501,549. For the past few decades, the group has been witness to the Naxalite–Maoist insurgency. Gondi people, at the behest of the Chhattisgarh government, formed the Salwa Judum, an armed militant group, to fight the Naxalite insurgency. This was disbanded by order of the Supreme Court of India on 5 July 2011, however.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Gond, used by outsiders, is still uncertain. Some believe the word to derive from the Dravidian &quot;kond&quot;, meaning hill, similar to the Khonds of Odisha.

Another theory, according to Vol. 3 of the &quot;Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life&quot;, is that the name was given to them by the Mughal dynasty of the 16th–18th centuries. It was the Mughals who first used the term &quot;Gond&quot;, meaning &quot;hill people&quot;, to refer to the group.

The Gonds call themselves Koitur (Kōītōr) or Koi (Kōī), which also has no definitive origin.

==History==
The origins of the Gonds is unclear. Some researchers have claimed that the Gonds were a collection of disparate tribes that adopted a proto-Gondi language as a mother tongue from a class of rulers, originally speaking various pre-Dravidian languages. While there is an affinity between Gonds and Munda peoples, researchers point to a more complex event involving language shift through a Dravidian linguistic expansion, rather than a recent event of Gondi replacing a North Munda language, hence supporting distinct origins for these two groups.

R. V. Russell believed the Gonds came into Gondwana from the south: up the Godavari into Vidarbha, from there up the Indravati into Bastar, and up the Wardha and Wainganga into the Satpura Range.

The first historical reference to the Gonds appears in Muslim writings from the 14th century. Scholars believe the Gonds ruled Gondwana, a region extending from present-day eastern Madhya Pradesh to western Odisha, and from northern Andhra Pradesh to the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradesh, between the 13th and 19th centuries CE.

The first kingdom of the Gonds was that of Chanda, founded in 1200, although some genealogies trace its founders to the 9th century CE. The Gonds of Chanda originated from Sirpur in what is now northern Telangana and were said to have overthrown the previous rulers of the country, called the Mana dynasty. Another theory states that after the downfall of the Kakatiyas in 1318, the Gonds of Sirpur had the opportunity to throw off outside domination and built their own kingdom. The kingdom of Chanda developed extensive irrigation and the first defined revenue system of the Gond kingdoms. It also began to build forts, which later became highly sophisticated. Khandakhya Ballal Shah founded the town of Chandrapur and shifted the capital there from Sirpur. The &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; records the kingdom as being fully independent, and it even conquered some territory from nearby sultanates. However, during Akbar&#x27;s rule, Babji Shah began paying tribute after the Mughals incorporated territory to their south into the Berar Subah.

The kingdom of Garha was founded in the 14th century by Jadurai, who deposed the previous Kalachuri rulers. Garha-Mandla is known for queen Rani Durgavati, who fought against Mughal emperor Akbar (d. 1564). Mandla was then ruled by her son Bir Narayan, who similarly fought until he died. Afterward, his kingdom was offered to Chanda Shah by the victorious Mughals. During Shah Jahan&#x27;s reign, his successor Hirde Shah was attacked by the Bundelas and shifted the capital to Mandla. His successors fought against themselves and invited the aid of Aurangzeb and the Marathas to their cause.

Deogarh was founded in the early 13th century. It is said that its founder, Jatba, slew the previous Gauli rulers during a temple festival. In the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, Deogarh was said to have 2,000 cavalry, 50,000 footmen, and 100 elephants and was ruled by a monarch named Jatba. Jatba built outposts in the Berar plains, including a fort near modern Nagpur. It was his grandson Bakr Shah who, in order to enlist Aurangzeb&#x27;s help, converted to Islam and became Bakht Buland Shah. Shah founded the city of Nagpur and brought a revival of the fortunes of the Deogarh kingdom. During his reign, the kingdom covered the southeastern Satpura range from Betul to Rajnandgaon in the east, and parts of the northern Berar plains. Under his son Chand Sultan, Nagpur gained even more importance.

These kingdoms were briefly conquered by the Mughals, but eventually, the Gond rajas were restored and were simply under Mughal suzerainty. In the 1740s, the Marathas began to attack the Gond rajas, causing both rajas and subjects to flee from the plains to the forests and hills. Raghoji Bhonsle forced the Gond rajas of Garha-Mandla to pay tribute to him. Marathi caste groups quickly replaced the displaced original population. Maratha occupation of the Gond rajas&#x27; territory continued until the Third Anglo-Maratha War, when the British took control over the remaining Gond zamindaris and took over revenue collection. The British, who regarded the Gonds as &quot;plunderers&quot; and &quot;thieves&quot; before their takeover, began to view the Gonds as &quot;timid&quot; and &quot;meek&quot; by the mid-19th century. The remaining Gond zamindaris were absorbed into the Indian union upon independence.

During colonial rule, the Gonds were marginalised by colonial forest management practices. The Bastar rebellion of 1910, better known in the tribal belt as the &quot;bhumkal&quot;, was a partly successful armed struggle against colonial forest policy that denied the Madia and Muria Gonds of Bastar, along with other tribes in the region, access to the forest for their livelihoods. In the early 1920s, Komaram Bheem, a Gond leader from Adilabad in Hyderabad state, rebelled against the Nizam and sought a separate Gond raj. It was he who coined the well-known slogan &quot;jal, jangal, jameen&quot; (&quot;water, forest, land&quot;) that has symbolised Adivasi movements since independence.

In 1916, Gondi intellectuals from various parts of Gondwana formed the Gond Mahasabha to protect Gondi culture from increasing outside influence. The organisation held meetings in 1931 and 1934 to discuss ways to preserve Gond culture from manipulation by outsiders, social norms the Gonds should have, and solidarity between the Gonds of different parts of Gondwana. Starting in the 1940s, various Gond leaders agitated for a separate state that would encompass the erstwhile territory of Gondwana, especially tribal areas of eastern Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Vidharbha, and Adilabad. The demand reached its peak in the early 1950s, when Heera Singh founded the Bharatiya Gondwana Sangh to agitate for statehood. Singh held many meetings throughout Gondwana and could mobilise 100,000 people between 1962 and 1963, but his movement had died down by the late 1960s and was never taken seriously by the Indian authorities. Other methods of agitation, including petitions and demands by various Gond organisations, were ignored by the state. In the 1990s, Heera Singh Markam and Kausalya Porte founded the Gondwana Ganatantra Party to fight for statehood.

The Gond rajas used &quot;Singh&quot; or &quot;Shah&quot; as titles, influenced by the Rajputs and Mughals. The Gond are also known as the &quot;Raj Gond&quot;. The term was widely used in the 1950s but has now become almost obsolete, probably because of the political eclipse of the Gond rajas.

==Society==
Gond society is divided into several exogamous patrilineal units known as &quot;sagas&quot;. The number depends on the region, with Gonds in the hills of Madhya Pradesh and the northern Nagpur plain having only two and those in the southern Nagpur plain and Adilabad having four. In Adilabad, these &quot;Sagas&quot; are called &quot;Yerwen&quot;, &quot;Sarwen&quot;, &quot;Siwen&quot;, and &quot;Nalwen&quot;, and their names refer to the number of ancestors for that &quot;saga&quot;. In Adilabad, there is a fifth &quot;saga&quot;, &quot;Sarpe saga&quot;, which for marriage purposes is linked with &quot;Sarwen&quot;, although their origin myths are different. According to Gond mythology, all &quot;sagas&quot; once lived in a single village but soon moved out and established individual villages. The names of these ancestral villages are preserved in culture and sometimes identified with present-day locations. The number of ancestors for each &quot;saga&quot; is its symbol, and on many ceremonial and ritual occasions, the number of involved animals, people, actions, or objects corresponds to that &quot;saga&quot;&#x27;s number.

The &quot;saga&quot; exists mostly in the sphere of ritual and has no real political or organizational significance. The most visible sign of &quot;saga&quot; consciousness is in the worship of &quot;Persa Pen&quot;, although this occurs mainly at the clan level. All worshippers of the same &quot;Persa pen&quot; see themselves as agnatically related, and so any intermarriage or sexual relations between them is forbidden. Gonds use the term &quot;soira&quot; to refer to &quot;sagas&quot; whose members they can marry.

Each &quot;saga&quot; is regarded as performing actions essential to society as a whole. During ceremonies and ritual events, the &quot;saga&quot; becomes important for determining roles in the proceedings. For instance, in the worship of a clan&#x27;s &quot;Persa pen&quot;, the clan priest is involved in sacrifice while two members of a &quot;soira saga&quot; to the celebrating clan dress the idol and cook the sacrificial food. During certain parts of Gond festivals, participants divide into &quot;saga&quot; or &quot;soira&quot;. For serving the sacrificial meal at &quot;Persa Pen&quot;, members of each &quot;saga&quot; sit separately and are served in order of which their ancestors emerged from the cave in their origin story. However, all &quot;sagas&quot; have equal status in Gond society. Members of each &quot;saga&quot; work cooperatively on issues affecting their relationship with other &quot;sagas&quot;, such as negotiations about bride price in marriage. In addition, for ritual purposes, any person can be replaced by someone of the same age, generation, and &quot;saga&quot;. As an example, in a marriage where, for instance, the bride&#x27;s parents are not present, a couple from the same &quot;saga&quot; as the bride can stand in for the bride&#x27;s parents in the ritual. This applies also to the relations between Gonds and Pardhans: if a Pardhan of the same clan is not found, then a Pardhan belonging to a different clan in the same &quot;saga&quot; can be brought in as a suitable replacement.

Subdivided within the &quot;saga&quot; is the &quot;pari&quot;, or clan, the main unit of organisation of Gond society. In each &quot;saga&quot;, the number of clans is determined by the number of ancestors of that &quot;saga&quot;. The clans of a &quot;saga&quot; are arranged by precedence based on when they emerged from the cave in the Gond creation story. This precedence regulates behaviour during some rituals. For instance, during the First Fruit festival, all members of a &quot;saga&quot; eat with the seniormost member of the seniormost &quot;pari&quot; of the &quot;saga&quot; represented in the village. Group relations between senior and junior &quot;pari&quot; are based on relations between older and younger brothers. For instance, members of a senior &quot;pari&quot; cannot marry a widow from a junior &quot;pari&quot;, since it is seen as analogous to the marriage between an elder brother and a younger brother&#x27;s wife. Clans generally have names relating to specific plants. Some common &quot;pari&quot; include Tekam, Uikey, Markam, Dhurwe, and Atram.

Each clan is divided into several parallel lineages, called &quot;kita&quot;. Each of these &quot;kita&quot; has a specific ritual function within Gond society: for instance, the &quot;katora kita&quot; is the only &quot;kita&quot; that presides over the worship of &quot;Persa Pen&quot;. &quot;Kita&quot; in some clans use Maratha titles like Deshmukh, bestowed on certain Gond chiefs. The &quot;kita&quot; functions only in the ritual sphere. Sometimes, the clans are also divided into &quot;khandan&quot;, or subclans, which are generally organic in nature. Each &quot;khandan&quot; is like a mini-clan, in that it has its own set of ritual objects for worship of &quot;Persa Pen&quot; and is formed when a group in a &quot;pari&quot; including a &quot;katora&quot; decide to set up a new centre for worship of &quot;Persa Pen&quot;. Eventually, this group becomes solidified into a &quot;khandan&quot;.

==Culture==
Many astronomical ideas were known to ancient Gonds, who had their own local terms for the Sun, Moon, Milky Way, and constellations. Most of these ideas served as the basis for their timekeeping and calendrical activities.


The Gondi language is spoken by almost 3 million people, mainly in the southern area of the Gond range. This area encompasses the southeastern districts of Madhya Pradesh, eastern Maharashtra, northern Telganana, and southern Chhattisgarh (mainly in the Bastar division). The language is related to Telugu. In the early 20th century, it was spoken by 1.5 million people, nearly all of whom were bilingual. At present, the language is only spoken by one fifth of Gonds and is dying out, even in its traditional linguistic range.

In Chhattisgarh, women perform the sua dance, which was named after the word for &quot;parrot&quot;. It is performed after Diwali to honour Shiva and Parvati, representing the belief that the parrot will bring their sadness to their lovers.

Diwali is a major festival for Adilabad&#x27;s Gond tribes, which they celebrate with the traditional Gussadi dance, donning peacock-feathered turbans, saffron attire, and joining in festive groups.

The Gondi people have their own version of the Ramayana, known as the &quot;Gond Ramayani&quot;, derived from oral folk legends. It consists of seven stories with Lakshmana as the protagonist, set after the main events of the Ramayana, where he finds a bride.

==Religion==
According to the 2011 census, there were 1,026,344 followers of the &quot;Gondi&quot; religion in India, with the majority residing in Madhya Pradesh (584,884), followed by Chhattisgarh (368,438), Maharashtra (66,857), Uttar Pradesh (3,419), and Jharkhand (2,419). The majority of Gond people still follow their own traditions of nature worship, but like many other tribes in India, their religion has been influenced by Brahminical Hinduism.

Many Gond people practice their own indigenous religion, Koyapunem, while some follow Sarnaism. Pola, Phag, and Dassera are some of their major festivals. A small number of Gonds are Christian or Muslim.

===Hinduism===
In medieval times, the Gondi kingdoms worshipped Vishnu as their patron deity.

The Gonds worship ancestral deities known as Angadevs, which Brahminical Hindus claim are a representation of the goddess Mahakali. There were seven groups of Angadevs, rescued by Pari Kupar Lingo from the Kachchargardh caves. In one version, there were twenty-eight Angadevs, and in another version, there were thirty-three.

In the second version, the Angadevs, or Saga Deva, were the children of the goddess Mata Kali Kankali after she ate a flower given to her by a sage. They were raised in Raitad Jungo&#x27;s ashram, and while they were playing, they met the gods Shambu and Gaura. Gaura offered them food, but because they were annoyed by the children&#x27;s mischief, Shambu and Gaura imprisoned them in the Kachchargardh caves. For twelve years, the children relied on a pond and a mythical bird who provided them food to survive. Kali Kankali pleaded to Shambu to release her children, but he rejected her pleas. Raitad Jungo then asked Pari Kupar Lingo to help him free the children, and Pari Kupar Lingo approached the bard Hirasuka Patalir. Patalir played music on his &quot;kingri&quot;, and the children were filled with strength to push the boulder blocking the caves from the outside world. Patalir was then crushed by the boulder. Ever since, the Kachchargardh caves became a site of pilgrimage, and Kali Kankali became one of the &quot;dharmagurus&quot; of the Gondi people.

A typical Gond reaction to death has been described as one of anger, because they believe death is caused by demons. Gonds usually bury their dead, together with their worldly possessions, but due to partial Hinduization, their kings were occasionally cremated, as per Vedic practices. Hinduization has led to cremation becoming more common.

===Koyapunem===
The native Gond religion, Koyapunem (meaning &quot;the way of nature&quot;), was founded by Pari Kupar Lingo. It is also known as Gondi Punem, or &quot;the way of the Gondi people&quot;.

In Gond folk tradition, adherents worship a high god known as Baradeo, whose alternate names are &quot;Bhagavan&quot;, &quot;Kupar Lingo&quot;, &quot;Badadeo&quot;, and &quot;Persa Pen&quot;. Baradeo oversees activities of lesser gods such as clan and village deities as well as ancestors. Baradeo is respected but he does not receive fervent devotion, which is shown only to clan and village deities, ancestors, and totems. These village deities include &quot;Aki Pen&quot;, the village guardian and the , the village mother goddess, a similar paradigm to folk traditions of other Dravidian peoples. Before any festival occurs, these two deities are worshipped. Each clan has their own , meaning &quot;great god&quot;. This god is benign at heart but can display violent tendencies. However, these tendencies are reduced when a , a bard, plays a fiddle.

Three people are important in Gond religious ceremonies: the &quot;baiga&quot; (village priest), the &quot;bhumka&quot; (clan priest), and the &quot;kaser-gaita&quot; (leader of the village).

As Kupar Lingo, the high god of the Gonds is depicted as a clean-shaven young prince wearing a trident-shaped crown, the &quot;munshul&quot;, which represents the head, heart, and body. There are many shrines to Kupar Lingo in Gondwana, and he is revered as an ancestral hero.

Per Gond religious beliefs, their ancestor Rupolang Pahandi Pari Kupar Lingo was born as the son of the chief Pulsheev, during the reign of Sambhu-Gaura, several thousand years ago. Kupar Lingo became the ruler of the Koya race and established the Gondi Punem, a code of conduct and philosophy that the Gondi practice. He gathered thirty-three disciples to teach the Gondi Punem to the distant lands of the &quot;koyamooree&quot;.

A principle in the Gond religion is &quot;munjok&quot;, which is non-violence, cooperation, and self-defense. Another part of Gond belief is &quot;salla&quot; and &quot;gangra&quot;, which represent action and reaction, superficially similar to the concept of karma in Hinduism. To prevent people from destroying themselves in conflict and discord, they are supposed to live under &quot;Phratrial&quot; society. Among the beliefs related to Phratrial society are the need to defend the community from enemies, working together and being in harmony with nature, and being allowed to eat animals (but not those representing a totem).

Like village deity worship in South India, Gonds believe their clan and village deities have the capability of possession. A person possessed by the spirit ceases to have any responsibility for their actions. Gonds also believe disease is caused by spirit possession.

Many Gonds worship Ravana, whom they consider to be the tenth of their people, the ancestor-king of one of their four lineages and the eightieth &quot;lingo&quot; (great teacher). On Dussehra, Gondi inhabitants of Paraswadi in Gadchiroli district carry an image of Ravana riding an elephant in a procession to worship him and &quot;protest&quot; the burning of his effigies.

Gonds venerate plants and animals, especially the &quot;saja&quot; tree. In some places, death is associated with a (&quot;Terminalia elliptica&quot;) tree. Stones representing souls of the dead, or , are kept in a at the foot of a &quot;saja&quot; tree. When there is no specific shrine for the village mother goddess, the &quot;saja&quot; tree is her abode. In addition, the &quot;Penkara&quot;, or holy circle of the clan, is under this tree. Gonds in Seoni believe Baradeo lives in a &quot;saja&quot; tree. The Mahua plant, whose flowers produce a liquor considered purifying, is also revered. In many Gond weddings, the bride and groom circle a post made out of a Mahua tree during the ceremony, and the Gonds of Adilabad perform the first ceremonies of the year when Mahua flowers bloom.

Gonds also believe in rain gods. One early British anthropologist noted how during the pre-monsoon hunting ceremony, the amount of blood spilled by the animals was indicative of the amount of rain to follow.

The gods are known as &quot;pen&quot; in the singular and &quot;pennoo&quot; in the plural. Other gods worshipped by the Gonds include:
* Mata Kali Kankali, the ancestral mother of the Gondi forefathers. She is associated with Mahakali.
* Dulha-Pen, the bridegroom god. He is represented by a stone, a man riding a horse, or a battle-axe.
* Gansam, the protector of villages from tigers. He is represented by a stone on the village boundary or a platform and a pole. Animals were sacrificed to him.
* Hardul, the god of weddings
* Bhimsen or Bhimal, the god of strength and the earth. He is associated with rocks, mountains, and rivers, and certain hills and rocks are considered holy sites of Bhimsen.
* Nat Awal or Dharti Mata, the goddess of fertility
* Bhumi, the earth and mother of humanity
* Nat Auwal, the mother goddess of the village. She is invoked when the village partakes in a ceremony, from seasonal rites to prayers against disasters.
* Thakur Dev, the male guardian of the village
* Hulera-Pen, the protector of cattle
* Maitya-Pen, the demon of whirlwinds
* Narayan-Pen, the sun god
* Kodapen, the horse god
* Maswasi Pen, the hunting god
* Kanya, water spirits

==Classification==
Gondi people are designated as a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Odisha, and West Bengal.

The Government of Uttar Pradesh had classified them as a Scheduled Caste, but by 2007, they were one of several groups that was redesignated as Scheduled Tribes. As of 2017, that tribal designation applies only to certain districts, not the entire state. The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Gond population at 21,992.

==In popular culture==
Gondi people have been portrayed in the 2017 Amit V. Masurkar film &quot;Newton&quot; and in S.S. Rajamouli&#x27;s 2022 blockbuster &quot;RRR&quot;, in which N. T. Rama Rao Jr. plays a fictionalised version of the Gond tribal leader Komaram Bheem.

Some people have speculated that the plot of the 2021 film &quot;Skater Girl&quot; is based on the life of Gond skateboarder Asha Gond. The film&#x27;s writer and director, Manjari Makijany, has denied this, however.

<doc id="537017" wikidata="Q1382604" url="?curid=537017" title="Jack Hylton">
<text>Jack Hylton (born John Greenhalgh Hilton; 2 July 1892 – 29 January 1965) was an English pianist, composer, band leader and impresario.

Hylton rose to prominence during the British dance band era, being referred as the &quot;British King of Jazz&quot; and &quot;The Ambassador of British Dance Music&quot; by the musical press, not only because of his popularity which extended throughout the world, but also for his use of unusually large ensembles for the time and his polished arrangements. He mostly retired from the music industry after 1940, becoming a successful theatrical businessman until his death.

==Early life and career==
He was born John Greenhalgh Hilton in Great Lever near Bolton, Lancashire, the son of George Hilton, a cotton yarn twister. His father was an amateur singer at the local Labour Club and Hylton learned piano to accompany him on the stage. Hylton later sang to the customers when his father bought a pub (The Round Croft) in nearby Little Lever, becoming known as the &quot;Singing Mill-Boy&quot;. He also performed as a relief pianist for various bands. In 1905 he joined a pierrot troupe in Rhyl and he went on to conduct the orchestra of a touring pantomime.

In 1913 he moved to London where he initially worked as an organist at a cinema in Stoke Newington. A year later he was working as a pianist in the 400 Club and playing with the Stroud Haxton Band. During the First World War he moved to be a musical director of the band of the 20th Hussars, and later in the Army Entertainment Division (N.A.C.B.).

After the First World War, Hylton formed a double act with Tommy Handley to little success, also collaborating in a number of short-lived stage shows. In 1919 he moved to Blackpool, where he composed and sold songs to tourists. He returned to London, playing with the &quot;Queens&quot; Dance Orchestra, wrote arrangements of popular songs and recorded them for the His Master&#x27;s Voice and Zonophone under the label &quot;Directed by Jack Hylton&quot; (being credited in lieu of a pay rise), his records carrying the new style of jazz-derived American dance music.

==1920s and 1930s==
After being dismissed by his own bandmates from the Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1922, Hylton not only set up his own band, but also set up a number of other orchestras under the Jack Hylton Organisation. Even though he was not professionally trained for business, he brought his band to success even at a time when the Great Depression hit hard during the 1930s. His good reputation allowed him to make contacts with famous jazz artists of the time, and he was credited for bringing Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and others to Britain and Europe in the 1930s.

An ensemble consisting at times of more than 20 musicians, the Hylton orchestra quickly stood out from the rest. Unlike many other bandleaders who took up residences at nightclubs and ballrooms, Hylton often embarked on lengthy tours of England, which ultimately moulded the concept most Britons had of jazz.

By the mid-1920s, he was usually referred as the &quot;British King of Jazz&quot;, a notion Hylton initially dismissed. As late as 1926, he thought of jazz as &quot;a bunch of noises&quot; popular at the end of the First World War, &quot;when everything was topsy-turvy&quot;. Hylton first appeared on radio through station 2LO in 1924, and on 24 June 1925, he cut the His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27;s first electric record, &quot;Feelin&#x27; Kind O&#x27; Blue&quot;, at Hayes in Middlesex.

The second half of the 1920s marked Hylton&#x27;s highest point of prominence. After recovering from a near-fatal car accident – which took place on 20 January 1927, on way to the Gramophone Company studios in Hayes, Middlesex – he made the first in a string of &quot;continental tours&quot; that lasted until 1930. The orchestra&#x27;s line-up also included some of the most skilled musicians of the time. &quot;Regular&quot; players included saxophonists Billy Ternent (who was also the band&#x27;s main arranger and co-leader), Edward Owen (E.O.) &quot;Poggy&quot; Pogson and Noel &quot;Chappie&quot; d&#x27;Amato, trumpeter/cornetist Jack Jackson, trombonist Lew Davis, violinists Hugo Rignold and Harry Berly, pianist/arranger Peter Yorke, and (from 1928) singer Sam Browne. The orchestra was often augmented with members of other Hylton-controlled bands, especially for 12-inch &quot;concert arrangements&quot;. According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of 7 June 1930, between four and five million records sold in 1929 (out of 50 million sold overall) were made by Hylton, although three million has been suggested as likely a more accurate figure.

By the time the Depression started biting in 1930, Hylton downsized his band and began performing in Europe less frequently; that same year, however, Maurice Chevalier recorded with Hylton, who also made the first recording of &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, and Pat O&#x27;Malley replaced Browne as vocalist. In 1930, they recorded &quot;Amy, Wonderful Amy&quot;, a song about Amy Johnson. Hylton also became a director and major shareholder of the new Decca record label, switching from His Master&#x27;s Voice in late 1931. The following year, he was decorated by the French government, recorded with Paul Robeson, and made the first transatlantic entertainment broadcast with Paul Whiteman and his orchestra.

In late 1933, Hylton left Decca after refusing to take a pay cut, not making records until 1935 when he rejoined His Master&#x27;s Voice. He spent 1934 touring Europe again, and adopted &quot;The Soldiers in the Park&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;Oh Listen to the Band&quot;) as his signature tune. In 1935, he appeared in his first feature film, the musical comedy &quot;She Shall Have Music&quot;, which starred June Clyde and Claude Dampier.

That same year, Hylton finally was able to perform in the United States; he had repeatedly attempted this for almost a decade, but had been opposed by the musicians&#x27; unions (a 1929 tour was cancelled at the last minute). Standard Oil signed Hylton for a radio show on CBS, not only paying him and his star players, but also paying all expenses for those band members unable to play in the US. Whilst in Chicago, Hylton made a number of records with his radio band for Victor. Union pressure led him to return to the UK in 1936, although Pat O&#x27;Malley and Alec Templeton stayed in America, making a name for themselves.

Upon returning to Britain, he was criticised for adopting the then-popular swing rhythm, so he kept playing in his well-established style, including a series of new &quot;concert recordings&quot;. After a new tour of Europe in 1937, which included a month-long run of performances at Berlin&#x27;s Scala Theatre in Nazi Germany, Hylton began appearing on radio more frequently, starring in Radio Luxembourg&#x27;s &quot;Rinso Radio Revue&quot; until 1939, when he appeared in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Band Waggon&quot;, as well as its 1940 film adaptation. Hylton and his band also made a number of appearances on BBC television in the 1930s, on one of which Ernie Wise made his television debut.

==1940s and 1950s==
The Jack Hylton orchestra disbanded in 1940 as many of its members were called up for service, although Jack continued to conduct orchestras for radio in the years to come, leading the Glenn Miller Orchestra when it visited England in 1943. During the war, he took the London Philharmonic Orchestra around Britain, giving promenade concerts. This helped to keep the orchestra going when its normal programme had ceased and it was on the edge of bankruptcy.

At this point in his career he became an impresario, discovering new stars and managing radio, film and theatre productions, from ballets to circuses. His productions dominated the London theatres with such productions as &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, and &quot;Kismet&quot;.

In 1950 he reunited with a number of his former employees, many of whom had become successful in their own right, for that year&#x27;s Royal Command Performance, billed as &quot;The Band that Jack Built&quot;. Despite their success, Hylton resisted calls for his return to band-leading. There were rumours in 1954 that he would stand for Parliament from Bolton, where he was a prominent member of the local Labour Party branch.

In November 1955, he was contracted as Advisor of Light Entertainment to Associated-Rediffusion (A-R), winner of the London weekday franchise in the recently established ITV network. He founded Jack Hylton Television Productions, Ltd. in that same month to produce a range of light entertainment programming exclusively for A-R. In spite of their popularity, however, the company&#x27;s productions were of low quality, with performers even apologising in front of millions of viewers at times. This in turn helped establish ITV&#x27;s reputation for coarseness, a stigma it would only shake off by the 1970s. Hylton refused to renew his ITV contract in 1959; the last shows made by the company were broadcast in 1960.

==1960s==
In his final years Hylton was still producing stage shows, as well as taking a leading role in organising various Royal Command Performances, until his final stage production, &quot;Camelot&quot;, in 1965.

In 1965 a televised tribute to Hylton, &quot;The Stars Shine for Jack&quot;, was held in London on Sunday 30 May at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with many artists including Arthur Askey, the Crazy Gang, Marlene Dietrich, Dickie Henderson and Shirley Bassey.

==Personal life==
Hylton was married twice; firstly in 1913 in St Asaph, Flintshire, Wales, to bandleader Ennis Parkes (born Florence Parkinson), whom he had met during his pierrot work. They separated in 1929, but remained relatively close until Parkes&#x27;s death in 1957, despite the formation of a short-lived &quot;Mrs. Jack Hylton Band&quot; in the mid-1930s. During the 1930s he had a long affair with model Frederika Kogler (&quot;Fifi&quot;), with whom he had two daughters: Jackie (b. 1932) and Georgina (b. 1938). He also had a son, Jack (b. 1947) by a later affair with the singer and actress Pat Taylor and a daughter, Angela (b. 1965) by an affair with Rosalina Neri.

He secondly married in Geneva in 1963, to Australian model and beauty queen Beverley Prowse (1932–2000).

Hylton was decorated by the French government on two occasions for his contribution to the entertainment industry.

==Death==
On 26 January 1965, complaining of chest and stomach pains, Hylton was admitted to the London Clinic. He died there three days later, from a heart attack, aged 72. Hylton&#x27;s spending habits and generosity left his estate with £242,288. Hylton said to his son during his latter years, &quot;I won&#x27;t leave you much, but we&#x27;ll have a good laugh spending it while I&#x27;m here!&quot; However, this equates to £4.6 million in 2018, when adjusted for inflation.

He is buried in the churchyard of St Catherine at Gosfield, Essex. His wife Beverley is buried beside him.

==Legacy==

Specialist dance band radio stations, such as Radio Dismuke and Swing Street Radio, continue to play his records. Hylton also features regularly on the Manx Radio programme &quot;Sweet &amp; Swing&quot;, presented by Howard Caine.

His 1930 recording of &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; was used during the closing credits of episode four of Ken Burns&#x27;s documentary series &quot;The Roosevelts&quot;.

Hylton is portrayed by Ted Robbins in the 2011 television film &quot;Eric and Ernie&quot;.

<text>Temperate rainforests are rainforests with coniferous or broadleaf forests that occur in the temperate zone and receive heavy rain.

Temperate rainforests occur in oceanic moist regions around the world: the Pacific temperate rainforests of North American Pacific Northwest as well as the Appalachian temperate rainforest in the Appalachian region of the United States; the Valdivian temperate rainforests of southwestern South America; the rainforests of New Zealand and southeastern Australia; northwest Europe (small pockets in Great Britain and larger areas in Ireland, southern Norway, northern Iberia and Brittany); southern Japan; the Black Sea–Caspian Sea region from the southeasternmost coastal zone of the Bulgarian coast, through Turkey, to Georgia, and northern Iran.

The moist conditions of temperate rainforests generally support an understory of mosses, ferns and some shrubs and berries. Temperate rainforests can be temperate coniferous forests or temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.

==Definition==

For temperate rainforests of North America, Alaback&#x27;s definition is widely recognized:
* Annual precipitation over (KJ)
* Mean annual temperature is between .
However, required annual precipitation depends on factors such as distribution of rain over the year, temperatures over the year and fog presence, and definitions in other regions of the world differ considerably. For example, Australian definitions are ecological-structural rather than climatic:
* Closed canopy of trees excludes at least 69% of the sky.
* Forest is composed mainly of tree species which do not require fire for regeneration, but with seedlings able to regenerate under shade and in natural openings.
Australian definitions would exclude some temperate rainforests of western North America that are Coast Douglas-fir dominant, such as parts of the Klamath Mountains in southern Oregon and northern California, the Puget Lowlands of western Washington and the Georgia Depression in British Columbia, as their dominant tree species, the Coast Douglas-fir, requires stand-destroying disturbance to initiate a new cohort of seedlings. The North American definition would in turn exclude a part of temperate rainforests under definitions used elsewhere.

==Canopy level==

For forests, canopy refers to the upper layer or habitat zone, formed by mature tree crowns and including other biological organisms (epiphytes, lianas, arboreal animals, etc.). The canopy level is the third level of the temperate rainforest. The trees forming the canopy, conifers, can stand as tall as 100 metres or more. A variety of species survive in the canopy. The tops of these trees collect most of the rain, moisture, and photosynthesis that the rainforest takes in. They form a canopy over the forest, covering about 95% of the floor during the summer.

The canopy&#x27;s coverage affects the shade tolerance levels of forest floor plants. When the canopy is in full bloom, covering about 95% of the floor, plant survival decreases. Some plant species have become shade tolerant in order to survive. 
The treetops take in the heavy amount of rain and keep the lower levels of the forest damp.

The canopy survives through photosynthesis. The leaves provide energy and nutrients for the trees, which provide homes and food for the forest. Through satellite data, the radiation use efficiency (RUE) calculates the annual amount of photosynthesis that occurs in temperate rainforests. A diverse amount of photosynthesis occurs based on the location and microclimates of the forest.
==Distribution==

===North America===

====Pacific temperate rainforests==== 
A portion of the temperate rain forest region of North America, the largest area of temperate zone rainforests on the planet, is the Pacific temperate rain forests ecoregion, which occur on west-facing coastal mountains along the Pacific coast of North America, from Kodiak Island in Alaska to northern California, and are part of the Nearctic realm. In the different system established by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, this same general region is classed as the Pacific Maritime Ecozone by Environment Canada and as the Marine West Coast Forest Level II ecoregion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In terms of the floristic province system used by botany, the bulk of the region is the Rocky Mountain Floristic Region but a small southern portion is part of the California Floristic Province.
Sub-ecoregions of the Pacific temperate rainforest ecoregion as defined by the WWF include the Northern Pacific coastal forests, Haida Gwaii ecoregion, Vancouver Island ecoregion, British Columbia mainland coastal forests, Central Pacific coastal forests, Cascades forests, Klamath-Siskiyou coastal forests, and Northern California coastal forests ecoregions. They vary in their species composition, but are all predominantly coniferous, sometimes with an understory of broadleaved trees and shrubs. Most of the precipitation occurs in winter, similar to Mediterranean climates, but in summer, fog moisture is extracted by the trees and produces a fog drip keeping the forest moist. The Northern California coastal forests are home to the Coast Redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), the world&#x27;s tallest tree. In the other ecoregions, Coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot;), Sitka Spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;), Western Hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;) and Western redcedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;) are the most important tree species. A common feature of Pacific temperate rainforests of North America is the Nurse log, a fallen tree which as it decays, provides ecological facilitation to seedlings. Trees such as the Coast Douglas-fir, Western Hemlock, Western Red Cedar, Pacific Yew, and Vine Maple are more closely related to coniferous and deciduous trees in the temperate forests of East Asia.

Some of the largest expanses of old growth are found in Olympic National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Mount Hood National Forest, Crater Lake National Park, Tongass National Forest, Mount St. Helens National Monument, Redwood National Park, and throughout British Columbia (including British Columbia&#x27;s Coastal Mountain Ranges), with the coastal Great Bear Rainforest containing the largest expanses of old growth temperate rainforest found in the world.

British Columbia&#x27;s Rocky Mountains, Cariboo Mountains, Rocky Mountain Trench (east of Prince George) and the Columbia Mountains of Southeastern British Columbia (west of the Canadian Rocky Mountains that extend into parts of Idaho and Northwestern Montana in the US), which include the Selkirk Mountains, Monashee Mountains, and the Purcell Mountains, have the largest stretch of interior temperate coniferous rainforests. These inland rainforests have more continental climate with a large proportion of the precipitation falling as snow. Being closer to the Rocky Mountains, there is more of a diverse mammalian fauna. Some of the best interior rainforests are found in Mount Revelstoke National Park and Glacier National Park (Canada) in the Columbia Mountains.

==== Appalachian temperate rainforests ====
Temperate rainforests are located in the southern Appalachian Mountains where orographic precipitation increases precipitation of weather systems coming from the west and from the Gulf of Mexico. Temperate rainforest extends through the Appalachian areas of western North Carolina, southeastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, eastern Tennessee, northern South Carolina, and northern Georgia.

Red spruce and Fraser fir are dominant canopy trees in high mountain areas. In higher elevation (over ), Fraser fir is dominant, in middle elevation () red spruce and Fraser fir grow together, and in lower elevation () red spruce is dominant. Yellow birch, mountain ash, and mountain maple grow in the understory. Younger spruce and fir and shrubs like raspberry, blackberry, hobblebush, southern mountain cranberries, red elderberry, minniebush, southern bush honeysuckle are understory vegetation. Below the spruce-fir forest, at around , are forests of American beech, yellow birch, maple birch, and oak. Skunk cabbage and ground juniper are northern species that were pushed into the areas from the north.

The mild and wet environment supports the high diversity of fungi. Over 2,000 species live in this area and scientists estimate many unidentified fungi may be there.[10]

===South America===

====Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests====
The temperate rainforests of South America are located on the Pacific coast of southern Chile, on the west-facing slopes of the southern Chilean coast range, and the Andes Mountains in both Chile and Western Argentina down to the southern tip of South America, and are part of the Neotropical realm. Temperate rainforests occur in the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregions. The Valdivian rainforests are home to a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, like &quot;Aextoxicon punctatum&quot;, &quot;Eucryphia cordifolia&quot;, and southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;), but include many conifers as well, notably Alerce (&quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot;), one of the largest tree species of the world.

The Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rainforests in South America. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the Pacific temperate rainforests of North America. The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the Antarctic flora, and share many plant families and genera with the temperate rainforests of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia. Fully half the species of woody plants are endemic to this ecoregion.

In the Valdivian region the Andean Cordillera intercepts moist westerly winds along the Pacific coast during winter and summer months; these winds cool as they ascend the mountains, creating heavy rainfall on the mountains&#x27; west-facing slopes. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400 m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35°S), and descends to 1,000 m in the south of the Valdivian region. In the summer the temperature can climb to , while during winter the temperature can drop below .

===Africa===

====Knysna-Amatole coastal rainforests (South Africa)====

The temperate rainforests of South Africa are part of the Knysna-Amatole forests that are located along South Africa&#x27;s Garden Route between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth on the south-facing slopes of South Africa&#x27;s Drakensberg Mountains facing the Indian Ocean. There are several coniferous podocarps that grow here. This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean, and resembles not only other temperate rainforests worldwide, but also the montane evergreen Afromontane forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa. A fine example of this forest is in South Africa&#x27;s Tsitsikamma National Park.

===Macaronesia===
====Azores====

The rainforests of the Azores (also known as cloud forests, due to the constant cloud coverage caused by orographic lift) are found in the more humid, montane areas that transition from the lower altitude laurissilva. They are generally found at altitudes ranging from , and receive of average annual rainfall.

Despite being located in the temperate zone, the Azores rainforest is similar in many ways to the cloud forest environments of the tropics and subtropics. These pluvial montane forests hold the highest biodiversity and degree of endemism of the whole archipelago. They are dominated by dense formations of endemic juniper, laurel, holly and tree heaths with several species of epiphytic ferns and an abundance of mosses and rainforest lichens (such as &quot;Erioderma&quot;).

The climate in the rainforest is mild and cool, averaging with a narrow diurnal temperature range and temperatures that only drop below freezing in exceptional years. 

Since human settlement in the 15th century, these rainforests, which once covered most of the high altitudes of the archipelago, have gradually been reduced to relics and are now found almost exclusively on three of the nine islands (Flores, Pico and Terceira). Their main threat is the expansion of cattle grazing pastures.

===Europe===
Temperate rainforest occurs in fragments across the north and west of Europe in countries such as southern Norway (see Scandinavian coastal conifer forests) and northern Spain. Other temperate rainforest regions include areas of south eastern Europe such as mountains on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, surrounding North Western Bulgaria along with the Black Sea.

====Atlantic Oakwood forest (Britain and Ireland)====

The woodlands are variously referred to in Britain as Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods, Western Oakwoods or Temperate Rainforest, Caledonian forest, and colloquially as &#x27;Celtic Rainforests&#x27;. They are also listed in the British National Vegetation Classification as British NVC community W11 and British NVC community W17 depending on the ground flora. The majority of surviving fragments of Atlantic Oakwoods in Britain occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples on the islands and shores of Loch Maree, Loch Sunart, Loch Lomond and one of the best preserved sites on the remote Taynish Peninsula in Argyll. There are also small areas on steep-sided riverine gorges in Snowdonia and Mid Wales, such as found at the Dolmelynllyn Estate in Gwynedd.

In England, they occur in the Lake District (Borrowdale Woods) and steep sided riverine and estuarine valleys in Devon and Cornwall and the Microclimate disused slate &amp; granite quarries in these counties. This includes the Fowey valley in Cornwall and the valley of the river Dart which flows off Dartmoor and has rainfall in excess of 2 metres per year.

Derrycunnihy Wood, located in the Killarney National Park, is the best example of the ancient damp-climate oceanic forest that covered an estimated 80 percent of Ireland prior to the arrival of humans in 7,000 BCE.

Guy Shrubsole&#x27;s &quot;Lost Rainforests of Britain&quot; attempts to find, map, photograph, and restore them.

====Colchian (Colchis) rainforests (Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia)====
The Colchian rainforests are found around both the southeast and west corners of the Black Sea starting in Bulgaria all the way to Turkey and Georgia and are part of the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests ecoregion, together with the drier Euxine forests further west. The Colchian rainforests are mixed, with deciduous black alder &quot;(Alnus glutinosa)&quot;, hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; and &quot;C. orientalis&quot;), Oriental beech (&quot;Fagus orientalis&quot;), and sweet chestnut &quot;(Castanea sativa)&quot; together with evergreen Nordmann fir (&quot;Abies nordmanniana&quot;, the tallest tree in Europe at 78 m), Caucasian spruce (&quot;Picea orientalis&quot;) and Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;).
The refugium is the largest throughout the Western Asian/ near Eastern region. The area has multiple representatives of disjunct relict groups of plants with the closest relatives in Eastern Asia, southern Europe, and even North America. Over 70 species of forest snails of the region are endemic. Some relict species of vertebrates are Caucasian parsley frog, Caucasian salamander, Robert&#x27;s snow vole and Caucasian grouse; they are almost entirely endemic groups of animals such as lizards of genus &quot;Darevskia&quot;. In general, species composition of this refugium is quite distinct and differs from that of the other Western Eurasian refugia. 
Genetic data suggest that the Colchis temperate rainforest, during the Ice Age, was fragmented into smaller parts; in particular, evolutionary lineages of the Caucasian Salamander from the central and south-western Colchis remained isolated from one another during the entire Ice Age.

====Fragas do Eume (Spain)====
The is a natural park situated in Galicia, north-western Spain. is a Galician word for &#x27;natural woodland&#x27;, (old-growth forest) and the park is an example of a temperate rainforest in which oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot; and &quot;Quercus pyrenaica&quot;) is the climax vegetation. The protected area extends along the valley of the river Eume within the municipalities of , , , and . Some 500 people reside within the park. The monastery of Monastery of also lies within the park.

The area was declared a natural park (a level of protection lower than national park) in 1997. It is one of six natural parks in Galicia. The European Union has recognised the park as a Site of Community Importance. There are a number of species of ferns. Invertebrate species include the Kerry slug and it is an important site for amphibians.

==== Vinatovača rainforest (Serbia) ====

The Vinatovača rainforest, alternatively spelled vintovača, is the only rainforest in Serbia. It has been left undisturbed for centuries due to strict conservation laws starting in the 17th century.

Vinatovača is situated in the central Kučaj mountains in the Upper Resava region, at an altitude between and . It is isolated and hard to reach which helped its preservation. It is believed that trees have not been cut in Vinatovača since about 1650. Being under strict protection means not only that the trees that die of old age are not being cleared or removed, but even picking herbs or mushrooms is forbidden. It is considered as an example of what central and eastern Serbia&#x27;s natural look is. Beech trees are up to tall and some specimens are estimated to be over 300 years old.

===Asia===

====Caspian Hyrcanian forest (Iran and Azerbaijan)====
The Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion in northern Iran contains a jungle in the form of a rainforest which stretches from the east in the Khorasan province to the west in the Ardabil Province, covering the other provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan. The Elburz or Alborz mountain range is the highest mountain range in the Middle East which captures the moisture of the Caspian Sea to its north and forms subtropical and temperate rainforests in the northern part of Iran. The Iranians call this forest and region &quot;Shomal&quot; which means &quot;north&quot; in Persian. This forest was known for most of the history for being home to the now extinct Caspian Tiger.

In southeast Azerbaijan, this ecoregion includes the Lankaran Lowland and the Talysh Mountains, the latter being evenly divided with Iran to the south. They are deciduous forests containing tree species such as black alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot; subsp. &quot;barbata&quot;), hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; and &quot;C. orientalis&quot;), Caucasian wingnut (&quot;Pterocarya fraxinifolia&quot;), chestnut-leaved oak (&quot;Quercus castaneifolia&quot;), Caucasian oak (&quot;Quercus macranthera&quot;), oriental beech (&quot;Fagus orientalis&quot;), Persian ironwood (&quot;Parrotia persica&quot;) and Persian silk tree (&quot;Albizia julibrissin&quot;).

The existing protected areas in Azerbaijan include:

* Gizil-Agach State Reserve – 
* Hirkan National Park – 
* Zuvand National Park – 
* Girkan State Reserve – 

====High elevation mountain rainforests (Taiwan)====
These forests are found in eastern Taiwan and Taiwan&#x27;s Central Mountain Ranges, part of the Taiwan subtropical evergreen forest region covering the higher elevations. Most of the lower elevations are covered by subtropical broadleaf evergreen forests, dominated by Chinese Cryptocarya (&quot;Cryptocarya chinensis&quot;), &quot;Castanopsis hystrix&quot; and Japanese Blue Oak (&quot;Quercus glauca&quot;). Higher elevations give way to temperate forests with large stands of old growth Taiwan Cypress (&quot;Chamaecyparis taiwanensis&quot;), Camphor tree (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;), maple (&quot;Acer&quot; spp.), Chinese yew (&quot;Taxus chinensis&quot;), Taiwan Hemlock (&quot;Tsuga chinensis&quot;), and Taiwan Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga sinensis var. wilsoniana&quot;). These higher elevation forests include also giant conifers Formosan Cypress (&quot;Chamaecyparis formosensis&quot;) and Taiwania (&quot;Taiwania cryptomerioides&quot;) Some fine examples of forests are found in Yushan (Jade Mountain) National Park and Alishan.

====Baekdu Mountain Range (Taebaek and Sobaek Mountain Ranges) and South Sea forests (Korea)====

The forests that cover the mountains and valleys of the Baekdu Mountain Range – from Mt. Baekdu, in the north, to Mt. Jiri, in the southwest, forming the spine of the Korean Peninsula – and the southern coast and islands of the peninsula – including Jeju Island – feature a wide variety of conifers and broadleaf trees. Much of these forests are protected in mountain and marine national forests, such as in Hallyeohaesang National Park, which encompasses of mountainous forests spread out over 69 uninhabited islands and 30 inhabited islands in Korea&#x27;s South Sea that provide a home to 1,142 plant species, including major species such as red pine, black pine, common camellia, serrata oak, and cork oak, as well as rare species such as nadopungnan (sedirea japonica), daeheongnan (cymbidium nipponicum) and the Korean winter hazel. Major animals species, such as otters, small-eared cats, and badgers also call Hallyeohaesang National Park home, and overall there are 25 mammal species, 115 bird species, 16 reptile species, 1,566 insect species, and 24 freshwater fish species found among the forested, mountains islands.

Seoraksan National Park covers of mountainous forests near the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, and is a UNESCO designated Biosphere Preservation District. Over 2,000 animal species live in Seoraksan, including the Korean goral, musk deer, and there are also more than 1,400 rare plant species, such as the edelweiss.

====Taiheiyo (Pacific) rainforests (Japan)====
Southwestern Japan&#x27;s Taiheiyo evergreen forests region covers much of Shikoku and Kyūshū Islands, and the Southern/Pacific Ocean-facing side of Honshu (&quot;Taiheiyo&quot; is the Pacific Ocean, in Japanese). Here the natural forests are mainly broadleaf evergreen in lower elevations and deciduous in higher elevations. The &quot;Hydrangea hirta&quot; species is an endemic deciduous species that can be found in this area. The limit occurs at 500–1000 metres depending on latitude. The main tree species are members of beech family (Fagaceae). In lower altitudes these include evergreen oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), Japanese Chinquapin (&quot;Castanopsis cuspidata&quot;) and Japanese Stone Oak (&quot;Lithocarpus edulis&quot;), and in higher altitudes Japanese Blue Beech (&quot;Fagus japonica&quot;) and Siebold&#x27;s beech (&quot;Fagus crenata&quot;).

Some of the best preserved examples of forest are found in Kirishima-Yaku National Park on the Island of Yakushima off of Kyūshū in a very wet climate (the annual rainfall is 4,000 to 10,000 mm depending on altitude). Because of relatively infertile soils on granite, Yakushima&#x27;s forests in higher elevations are dominated by a giant conifer species, Japanese Cedar (&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;), rather than deciduous forests typical of the mainland. Other areas include Mount Kirishima near Kagoshima in southern Kyūshū. On Southern Honshū, there is a forest with the Nachi Falls located in Yoshino-Kumano National Park. This particular area of Honshū has been described as one of the rainiest spots in Japan.

==== Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests (Bhutan, India, Nepal) ====

It is a temperate broadleaf forest ecoregion found in the middle elevations of the eastern Himalayas, including parts of Nepal, India, and Bhutan.

====Southern Siberian rainforest====

====Temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East====
The Russian Far East region is the eastern-most region of both Russia and the Asian continent as a whole. The Russian federal subjects of Primorsky Krai and Khabarovsk Krai are located in the southeast of this region, with Primorsky Krai sharing a land border with China and North Korea, and both federal subjects face the Pacific ocean to the eaat and share maritime borders with Japan. The Sikhote-Alin mountain range is located here and extends for about 1000 km in a northeast direction, parallel to the coast, from near the coastal city of Vladivostok.

Whilst the mountain range ascends from sea level to a maximum altitude of around 1900 metres contains a variety of different habitats, they are located in region with a temperate climate. During the last glacial maximum (or ice age), the area was not glaciated, allowing for the development of a complex ecosystem containing species with origins in Siberia’s boreal forest and Manchuria’s subtropical forests. Temperate rainforest covers most of the mountain slopes and the biogeographic region is known as the Primorye centre of plant diversity, a biogeographic meeting point of flora and fauna from temperate, subtropical and taiga climatic regions. Historically these forests ranged from the southeastern Pacific coast of Russia, through North Korea and into northern China, however vast human development, particularly in China, has limited the forest to its current range in the Russian Far East. In 2001, UNESCO recognized a 1.5 million hectare area of forest in the central part of the Sikhote-Alin mountains as a World Heritage Site in Russia, citing the area as one of the most unique and valuable areas of intact forest in the world 

Although not limited to forests, more than 2500 species of vascular plants have been described in the Primorye biographic region, of which many are considered relict and endemic species. Flora of mosses and lichens are particularly diverse. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List as rare and endangered. The forests fall in the transition zone between two biomes: the southern Asian hardwood forest and the northern coniferous forest. The rainforests are a mix of deciduous broadleaf and coniferous forest, with the dominant tree species becoming more coniferous at higher elevations, and more mixed forest found at lower elevations or within mountain valleys. The most common species include the Korean pine (&quot;Pinus koraiensis&quot;) and Manchurian fir (&quot;Abies holophylla&quot;) at the lowest elevations and coastlines. Jezo spruce (&quot;Picea jezoensis&quot;) and Khingan fir (&quot;Abies nephrolepis&quot;) are common species to be found from 700–1400 metres altitude. Other tree species include Mongolian oak (&quot;Quercus mongolica&quot;), silver birch (&quot;Betula platyphylla&quot;), Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), trembling aspen (&quot;Populus tremula&quot;), Siberian dwarf pine (&quot;Pinus pumila&quot;), Erman&#x27;s birch (&quot;Betula ermanii&quot;), and Dahurian larch (&quot;Larix gmelinii&quot;), a deciduous conifer common throughout, but dominant in the northernmost reaches of the forest Other characteristic flora include various ferns, lotus, (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;) and the willow &quot;Salix arbutifolia,&quot; &quot;Taxus cuspidata&quot;, &quot;Juniperus rigida&quot;, &quot;Phellodendron amurense&quot;, &quot;Kalopanax&quot;, &quot;Aralia elata&quot;, &quot;Maackia amurensis&quot;, &quot;Alnus japonica&quot;, &quot;Actinidia kolomikta&quot;, &quot;Schisandra chinensis&quot;, &quot;Celastrus orbiculatus&quot;, &quot;Thladiantha dubia&quot;, &quot;Weigela&quot;, &quot;Eleutherococcus&quot;, &quot;Flueggea suffruticosa&quot;, &quot;Deutzia&quot;, &quot;Betula schmidtii&quot;, &quot;Carpinus cordata&quot;, &quot;Acer mandshuricum&quot;, &quot;Parthenocissus tricuspidata&quot;, &quot;Vitis amurensis&quot;, and &quot;Panax ginseng&quot; and many others.

Along with the neighbouring Amur region of Russia, the temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East hold the last remaining habitats for the critically endangered Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and Manchurian sika deer. It has been estimated that there are less the 600 tigers. and around 90 leopards left in the wild. The area also contains populations of Asiatic black bears, Kamchatka brown bears, and Mongolian grey wolves, as the Russian Far East, altogether, might probably be the only place in the world where endangered tigers, leopards, bears, and grey wolves coexist. This region also happens to be some of the last of habitat of the Blakiston’s fish owl (Bubo blakistoni); along with being the world’s largest owl, it is unique in the way that it eats fish (primarily Masu salmon) and relies on old growth forests along river banks to hunt, nest, and breed. The Siberian grouse is similar to the spruce grouse and Franklin&#x27;s grouse of North America, and can be found in the dense, remote pockets of broadleaf, coniferous and deciduous forests of Far East Russia. Common ungulates include red deer, roe deer, wild boar, Manchurian moose, and musk deer.

==== Australian temperate rainforests ====

In Australia rainforests occur near the mainland east coast and in Tasmania. There are warm-temperate and cool-temperate rainforests. They are broadleaf evergreen forests with the exception of montane rainforests of Tasmania. Eucalypt forests are not classified as rainforests although some eucalypt forest types receive high annual rainfall (to over 2000 mm in Tasmania), and in the absence of fire they may develop to rainforest. If these widespread wet sclerophyll forests were considered rainforests, the total area of rainforest in Australia would be much larger.

Warm-temperate rainforest replaces subtropical rainforest on poorer soils or with increasing altitude and latitude in New South Wales and Victoria. Cool-temperate rainforests are widespread in Tasmania (Tasmanian temperate rainforests ecoregion) and they can be found scattered from the World Heritage listed Border Ranges National Park and Lamington National Park on the NSW/Queensland border to Otway Ranges, Strzelecki Ranges, Dandenong Ranges and Tarra Bulga in Victoria. In the northern NSW they are usually dominated by Antarctic Beech (&quot;Nothofagus moorei&quot;), in the southern NSW by Pinkwood (&quot;Eucryphia moorei&quot;) and Coachwood (&quot;Ceratopetalum apetalum&quot;) and in Victoria and Tasmania by Myrtle Beech (&quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot;), Southern Sassafras (&quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot;) and Mountain Ash (&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;). The montane rainforests of Tasmania are dominated by Tasmanian endemic conifers (mainly &quot;Athrotaxis&quot; spp.). They are dominated by Ferns such as &quot;Cyathea cooperi&quot;, &quot;Cyathea australis&quot;, &quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot;, &quot;Cyathea cunninghamii&quot; and &quot;Cyathea leichhardtiana&quot;.

====New Zealand temperate rainforests====
The temperate rainforests of New Zealand occur on the western shore of the South Island and on the North Island. The forests are made up of coniferous podocarps and broadleaf evergreen trees. The podocarps are abundant at lower elevations, while southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) can be found on higher slopes and in the cooler southernmost rainforests. Ecoregions include the Fiordland temperate forests and Westland temperate rainforests.

<text>Charles Stuart Kaufman (; born November 19, 1958) is an American screenwriter, film director, and novelist. Having first come to prominence for writing &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999), &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), and &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004), he went on to direct films based on his own screenplays: &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), &quot;Anomalisa&quot; (2015), and &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking of Ending Things&quot; (2020). In 2020, he released a novel, &quot;Antkind&quot;.

One of the most celebrated screenwriters of his era, Kaufman has received an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, two Independent Spirit Awards, and a Writers Guild of America Award. Film critic Roger Ebert called &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; &quot;the best movie of the decade&quot; in 2009. Three of Kaufman&#x27;s scripts appear in the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s list of the 101 greatest movie screenplays ever written.

==Early life and education==
Kaufman was born in New York City to a Jewish family on November 19, 1958, the son of Helen and Myron Kaufman. He grew up in Massapequa, New York, before moving to West Hartford, Connecticut. In high school, Kaufman was in the drama club, performing in numerous productions before landing the lead role in a production of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; during his senior year. After high school graduation, Kaufman attended Boston University before transferring to New York University, where he studied film. While attending NYU, Kaufman met Paul Proch, with whom he wrote many unproduced scripts and plays.

==Career==
=== Early comedy work (1983–1997) ===
Between 1983 and 1984, Kaufman and Proch wrote comedic articles and spoofs for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. His work included parodies of Kurt Vonnegut and the X-Men. Kaufman and Proch tried to get their screenplays produced, sending them to many people in the film industry. The only response the two ever received was a supportive letter from Alan Arkin about their screenplay &quot;Purely Coincidental&quot;. In hope of finding a talent agent, he wrote a portfolio of spec scripts based on television series such as &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. While pursuing his writing career, he began working odd jobs in customer service to support himself and his wife, Denise. During the late 1980s, Kaufman lived and worked in Minneapolis, working at the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; circulation department for four and a half years, as well as the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

In 1991, one of Kaufman&#x27;s spec scripts finally got attention, and he gained a talent agent. The agent suggested Kaufman move from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in search of more job prospects. He moved to Los Angeles alone for two months, interviewing for a variety of different television writing jobs. The only offer he got was a Comedy Central series titled &quot;Access America&quot;, hosted by actor Fred Willard, which coincidentally was being filmed in Minneapolis. Kaufman was prepared to accept the job and move back to Minneapolis until he was offered a job by David Mirkin, writing for the second season of his and Chris Elliott&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Get a Life&quot;, starring Elliott. He wrote two episodes of &quot;Get a Life&quot; before its cancellation in 1992. At first, Kaufman found the experience of working on a writing staff nerve-wracking and did not speak in the writer&#x27;s room for the first few weeks. After his work was well received by other members of the staff, Kaufman overcame his timidity and became more amenable to showing others his work.

After &quot;Get a Life&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Kaufman tried to get work on series such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Mr. Show&quot;, but was not hired by any of them. He continued to work on other comedic series: Fox&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;The Edge&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Larry&quot; and &quot;Ned and Stacey&quot;, the last of which he also produced. The most notable series he worked on in this period was &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, which featured writers and performers such as Louis C.K., Robert Smigel, Greg Daniels, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell. On all these series, Kaufman struggled to keep his material from being adulterated or not produced at all, because of his unconventional writing and his quiet nature.

Kaufman also wrote some pilot scripts of his own, but none of them was produced. These included two pilots for Disney, &quot;Depressed Roomies&quot; and &quot;Rambling Pants&quot; (the former a surrealist take on the &quot;buddy sitcom&quot; and the latter focused on the adventures of a time-travelling poet named Pants) and a pilot for HBO, &quot;In Limbo&quot;, a naturalistic look at a romantic relationship devoid of the usual tropes of romantic films. Before &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; was released, he was hired to pitch and write scripts for film projects that were never produced. These unproduced projects included a script for an adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, a pitch for a star vehicle for Don Rickles and Rodney Dangerfield in which they would play a washed-up, murderous comedy duo (an idea Kaufman used in &quot;Antkind&quot;), and a pitch for a R-rated version of the TV series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

=== Transition to films (1999–2004) ===
Kaufman first came to mainstream notice as the writer of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, directed by Spike Jonze, earning an Academy Award nomination for his effort and winning a BAFTA. He wrote the script on spec in 1994, sending it to many companies and studios, all of which turned it down. The script eventually reached Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Jonze, who agreed to direct the film.

After the success of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, another of Kaufman&#x27;s screenplays was produced: &quot;Human Nature&quot;, which was directed by Michel Gondry and produced by Kaufman and Jonze. Kaufman and Jonze reunited yet again as the screenwriter and director of &quot;Adaptation&quot;, which earned him another Academy Award nomination and his second BAFTA. &quot;Adaptation&quot; featured a fictionalized version of Kaufman and his fictional brother, Donald, who is credited as writer of the film along with Kaufman. The idea came to Kaufman while attempting to adapt Susan Orlean&#x27;s book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; into film. Struggling with writer&#x27;s block, Kaufman turned the script into an exaggerated account of his struggles with adapting the screenplay.

Kaufman wrote the screenplay for &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, a biopic based on the &quot;unauthorized autobiography&quot; of Chuck Barris, the creator of such popular game shows as &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and host of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. The film focuses on Barris&#x27;s claim to have been a CIA hit man. It was George Clooney&#x27;s directorial debut. Kaufman criticized Clooney for making drastic alterations to the script without consulting him (instead, Clooney consulted Barris). Kaufman said in an interview with William Arnold: &quot;The usual thing for a writer is to deliver a script and then disappear. That&#x27;s not for me. I want to be involved from beginning to end. And these directors [Gondry and Jonze] know that, and respect it.&quot;

&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;, released in 2004, was Kaufman&#x27;s second pairing with director Michel Gondry. Kaufman won his first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and third BAFTA for the film together with Gondry and French artist Pierre Bismuth. The trio also received the prestigious PEN American Center 2005 prize for screenplay for the film. David Edelstein described the film in &quot;Slate&quot; as &quot;&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; turned inside-out by Philip K. Dick, with nods to Samuel Beckett, Chris Marker, John Guare—the greatest dramatists of our modern fractured consciousness. But the weave is pure Kaufman.&quot;

=== Directorial debuts and career struggles (2005–2014) ===

After agreeing to participate in Carter Burwell&#x27;s &quot;Theater of the New Ear&quot;, a double bill &quot;sound play&quot;, Kaufman wrote and directed the audio play &quot;Hope Leaves the Theater&quot;, while the other play in the production, &quot;Sawbones&quot;, was written and directed by the Coen Brothers. &quot;Hope Leaves the Theater&quot; follows a middle-aged woman, dissatisfied with her life and relationships, watching a play-within-the-play, and featured performances by Hope Davis, Peter Dinklage and Meryl Streep. &quot;Theater of the New Ear&quot; debuted in April 2005 at St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York. Due to scheduling conflicts, later productions of &quot;Theater of the New Ear&quot; did not feature the Coens&#x27; play, replacing it with &quot;Anomalisa&quot;, which Kaufman wrote under the pseudonym &quot;&#x27;Francis Fregoli&quot;. &quot;Anomalisa&quot; centers on a man (David Thewlis) who perceives everyone in the world to be the same person (Tom Noonan) until he meets an exception (Jennifer Jason Leigh).

Kaufman made his directorial film debut with the postmodern film &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;, starring an ensemble cast led by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008. The idea for the film came when Kaufman and Spike Jonze were approached to direct a horror film. Rather than make a conventional horror film, the two agreed to have the film deal with things they found frightening, such as mortality and life&#x27;s brevity. Kaufman decided to direct the film after Jonze left the project to direct &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; instead. The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where it split critics, with some calling it the best film of the year and others finding it pretentious. In the years since its release, it has appeared on multiple lists ranking the best films of the 21st century. The film&#x27;s poor box office resulted in Kaufman finding it difficult to gain funding for scripts to which he has attached himself as director.

Kaufman was slated to write and direct a film with the working title &quot;Frank or Francis&quot;. Few details have been confirmed about the plot, except that it is a musical comedy about internet anger culture and was set to star Jack Black, Nicolas Cage, Steve Carell, Kevin Kline, Catherine Keener, Paul Reubens, Jacki Weaver and Elizabeth Banks. In July 2012, Black said that funding for the project had fallen through, as the studio was unsure about its chances for success after the financial failure of &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;. Although the future of the project is not certain, Kaufman says &quot;It could still happen. It would have to be reinvented, though. We had a whole cast and we were headed into pre-production. So, I&#x27;d have to get people back and who knows if they would be interested anymore. But at this point, we don&#x27;t have any money, so that&#x27;s a secondary concern.&quot;

Trying to make a return to television when the funding for &quot;Frank or Francis&quot; fell through, Kaufman sold a series to HBO in the May 2012 with Catherine Keener attached to star, but the series did not get past the scripting stage. Kaufman also directed and wrote a pilot for FX titled &quot;How and Why&quot; in 2014. The plot was described as being about a &quot;man (played by John Hawkes) who can explain how and why a nuclear reactor works but is clueless about life&quot;. Along with Hawkes, the pilot co-starred Michael Cera, Sally Hawkins, Catherine Keener and Tom Noonan. FX decided to not pick up the pilot.

While struggling to get his directorial work made, Kaufman continued to work as a writer for hire, writing numerous unproduced screenplays. These included a satire set on a planet inhabited by everyone who ever lived, to be directed by Spike Jonze; an adaptation of George Saunders&#x27;s book &quot;CivilWarLand in Bad Decline&quot;, to be directed by Ben Stiller; and an adaptation of Arthur Herzog&#x27;s novel &quot;IQ 83&quot;, starring Steve Carell. He later attempted to develop his &quot;IQ 83&quot; screenplay into a limited series for HBO, to no avail. He also did uncredited rewrites on films such as &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot; and &quot;Ad Astra&quot;. In April 2012, Kaufman was hired to adapt Patrick Ness&#x27;s &quot;Chaos Walking&quot; book series, of which he wrote the first draft before leaving the project. After multiple rewrites by other writers, the film was released in 2021 with Kaufman uncredited.

=== Continued film work and debut novel (2015–present) ===

Dino Stamatopoulos, a former colleague of Kaufman&#x27;s from &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, became interested in adapting Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Anomalisa&quot; play script into a stop motion animated film. With Kaufman&#x27;s permission, Stamatopoulos turned to the crowd-funding website Kickstarter to fund the film. The Kickstarter page was set up in August 2012 and by the time funding had ended $406,237 was pledged. The rest of the $8 million budget was funded by the film&#x27;s production company, Starburns Industries. Kaufman co-directed the film with Duke Johnson, who had previous experience in stop motion filmmaking, and the original cast of the play production returned to reprise their roles. It had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 4, 2015, receiving universal acclaim from critics. The film went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but like &quot;Synecdoche&quot;, it did poorly at the box office.

Kaufman&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Antkind&quot;, was released in July 2020. Kaufman said in 2016 that the novel was being written so as to be unfilmable, and is itself about &quot;an impossible movie&quot;. In &quot;Antkind,&quot; film critic B. Rosenberg attempts to recall a three-month long stop-motion animation film that perished in a fire. Believing the film to be his last chance at achieving the respect and admiration of his peers, B. embarks on an absurdist journey that explores comedy, film theory, philosophy, and social commentary across &quot;Antkind&quot;&#x27;s 706 pages.

In January 2018, it was announced that Kaufman was working on writing and directing an adaptation of Iain Reid&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking of Ending Things&quot;. In December 2018, it was announced that Brie Larson and Jesse Plemons were signed to co-star as the leads; the film was described as &quot;the story of a woman&#x27;s trip to a family farm that leads to an unexpected detour leaving her stranded, [and] a twisted mix of palpable tension, psychological frailty and sheer terror ensues.&quot; The project began filming in March 2019, with Jessie Buckley having replaced Larson, and Toni Collette and David Thewlis joining the cast, and was released on Netflix in September 2020 to positive reviews. 

In 2023, Kaufman directed his first short film, &quot;Jackals &amp; Fireflies&quot;. Based on a poem by Eva H.D., who also portrays the lead character, the film was shot entirely on a Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone by cinematographer Chayse Irvin. Kaufman has written a script about dreams for Ryan Gosling&#x27;s production company that Gosling may star in and an adaptation of the novel &quot;The Memory Police&quot; that Reed Morano is slated to direct.

==Themes and influences==
Kaufman&#x27;s works explore such universal themes as identity crisis, mortality, and the meaning of life through a metaphysical or parapsychological framework. While his work resists labels, it is sometimes described as surrealist. He uses metafiction as a literary device, and sometimes includes fictionalized &quot;facts&quot; about his life in his work, notably &quot;Adaptation.&quot;, &quot;Hope Leaves the Theater&quot;, and &quot;Antkind&quot;. Gender identity is also a recurrent theme in his work. Non-human primates also recur in Kaufman&#x27;s early work: in &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, Lotte has a pet chimpanzee named Elijah; in &quot;Human Nature&quot;, Puff was raised as a chimpanzee; in &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, Penny dreams about a monkey; and in &quot;Adaptation&quot;, the original deus ex machina was a Bigfoot-like &quot;Swamp Ape&quot;.

Some writers and directors Kaufman has named as favorites of his, or as influences, are Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Stanisław Lem, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Shirley Jackson, Philip K. Dick, Patricia Highsmith, Stephen Dixon, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Roy Andersson, Woody Allen, and the Coen brothers. He has also mentioned Tom Noonan&#x27;s &quot;What Happened Was...&quot; as a favorite of his.

==Personal life==
, Kaufman lives in Manhattan, having lived in Pasadena, California, since 1998. He is married to Denise Monaghan, with whom he has a daughter, Anna.

<text>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a 2004 American science fiction romantic drama film directed by Michel Gondry and written by Charlie Kaufman from a story by Gondry, Kaufman, and Pierre Bismuth. Starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, with supporting roles from Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson, the film follows two individuals who undergo a memory erasure procedure to forget each other after the dissolution of their romantic relationship. The title of the film is a quotation from the 1717 poem &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot; by Alexander Pope. It uses elements of psychological drama and science fiction and a nonlinear narrative to explore the nature of memory and love.

&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; opened in theaters in the United States on March 19, 2004, to widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, who hailed the visual style, editing, writing, score, themes, direction and performances, especially of Carrey and Winslet. The film was a box office success, grossing $74 million on a $20 million budget, and was named by the American Film Institute one of the Top 10 Films of 2004. At the 77th Academy Awards, Bismuth, Gondry and Kaufman won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Winslet received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. 

The film has been named by several publications as one of the best of the 21st century The film was the inspiration behind several music projects, such as Jay Electronica&#x27;s 2007 piece &quot;Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)&quot;, Jhené Aiko&#x27;s 2014 tracks &quot;Spotless Mind&quot; and &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;, Bastille&#x27;s 2022 single &quot;Remind Me&quot; and Ariana Grande&#x27;s 2024 album &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;.

==Plot==
Joel Barish discovers that his estranged girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski, has undergone a procedure to have her memories of him erased by the New York City firm Lacuna. Heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. In preparation, he records a tape recounting his memories of their volatile relationship.

The Lacuna employees work on Joel&#x27;s brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine; since her procedure, he has been using Clementine&#x27;s memories of Joel as a guide to seduce her. While the procedure runs on Joel&#x27;s brain, the technician, Stan, and the secretary, Mary, take drugs, party, and have sex.

Joel re-experiences his memories of Clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that he hide her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk.

In Joel&#x27;s apartment, Mary tries to impress Howard through their mutual interest in poetry by reciting a verse from &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot;. While Stan is outside, she tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss. Howard&#x27;s wife arrives and sees them through the window. Furious, she tells Howard to tell Mary the truth: Mary and Howard had previously had an affair, and Mary had her memories of it erased. Disgusted, Mary steals the Lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including Joel and Clementine.

Joel wakes up on Valentine&#x27;s Day with his memories of Clementine erased. He impulsively takes the Long Island Rail Road to Montauk and calls in sick to work. He accidentally meets Clementine on the train ride home; they are drawn to one another, and go on a date to the frozen Charles River in Boston. Joel drives Clementine home and Patrick sees the two of them, realizing they have found each other again. Joel and Clementine receive their Lacuna records from Mary and listen to their tapes together. They are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other and almost separate again, but agree to try again.

== Cast ==

* Jim Carrey as Joel Barish: A bookish introvert who enters a two-year relationship with Clementine Kruczynski. After their relationship ends, Clementine erases Joel from her memory, and he erases her from his mind in response. Charlie Kaufman depicted Joel with some of his own personality traits. Producers cast Carrey against type for his role as Joel, selecting him for his everyday appearance, as well as his comedic ability. According to Gondry, this was because &quot;It&#x27;s hard to be funny. It&#x27;s far easier to take someone really funny and bring them down than do the opposite.&quot; To induce Carrey, an actor who typically portrayed high-energy roles, to portray a restrained character, Gondry would not allow him to improvise, a restriction he did not place on the other cast members (Carrey objected). Gondry also put Carrey off balance by giving misleading orders or by rolling the camera at the wrong time. Gondry believed this would make Carrey forget what he should do to be Joel, allowing him to go in character. In the 2017 Netflix documentary &quot;Jim &amp; Andy&quot;, Carrey mentions a conversation with Gondry one year before shooting began for &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;, shortly after Carrey had a breakup with an unspecified woman. Gondry saw that Carrey&#x27;s emotional state at the time was &quot;so beautiful, so broken&quot; that he asked him to stay that way for one year to fit the character. In the documentary, Carrey commented, &quot;That&#x27;s how fucked up this business is.&quot; Nicolas Cage was Gondry&#x27;s original choice to play Joel, but Cage was unavailable as he was in high demand from independent directors after his performance in &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;.
* Kate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski: A spontaneous extrovert who, after breaking up with him after a two-year relationship, erases Joel Barish from her mind. Producers cast Winslet against type for her part as Clementine, as Winslet had previously featured heavily in period pieces. She received the role after she was the only actress to offer criticism on the script instead of pandering to the writers. After another actress won an Oscar, the studio attempted to make Gondry use her instead of Winslet for the role of Clementine, but Gondry threatened to walk from the project if that occurred. During filming, Gondry took Winslet to a separate room to coach her, and she wore wigs instead of dying her hair. Some commentators note how Clementine&#x27;s character criticizes the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stock character several years before film critic Nathan Rabin coined the phrase. Most commentators discuss one particular example to demonstrate this criticism, wherein Clementine warns Joel she is flawed: &quot;Too many guys think I&#x27;m a concept, or I complete them, or I&#x27;m gonna make them alive. But I&#x27;m just a fucked-up girl who&#x27;s looking for my own peace of mind. Don&#x27;t assign me yours.&quot; With her impulsiveness, emotional intensity (extreme mood changes), alcohol consumption, turbulent relationships, reckless behavior, and hasty idealization or devaluation of Joel, Clementine seems to exhibit traits of borderline personality disorder, although it is not clear whether Kaufman wrote her character with this specific diagnosis in mind. Gondry had earlier thought of casting Björk for the role of Clementine. She feared she would be emotionally affected and rejected the invitation after reading the script. Winona Ryder also met with Gondry for the role.
* Kirsten Dunst as Mary Svevo: The receptionist for Lacuna who, while dating Stan Fink, has a crush on Howard Mierzwiak. While erasing Joel&#x27;s memory, Howard&#x27;s wife catches her kissing Howard. Howard&#x27;s wife reveals Mary previously had a relationship with Howard, which Howard erased from her mind. She reacts to this information by quitting her job and mailing Lacuna&#x27;s company records to its customers. In the script, Mary and Howard&#x27;s relationship resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, leading to Howard pressuring Mary into an abortion, which Howard also erased from her memory.
* Mark Ruffalo as Stan Fink: A technician for Lacuna who is in a relationship with Mary Svevo until the reveal of her previous relationship with Howard Mierzwiak. Ruffalo received the role of Stan after providing an &quot;unexpected take on the role&quot; to Gondry when he suggested Stan be a fan of the Clash and resemble Joe Strummer.
* Elijah Wood as Patrick Wertz: Patrick is a technician for Lacuna who enters a relationship with Clementine by imitating Joel. They break up when Joel and Clementine begin dating for the second time. Seth Rogen auditioned for the role.
* Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Howard runs Lacuna. Before the film&#x27;s events, he had an affair with Mary, which ended with the relationship&#x27;s erasure from her mind. Wilkinson reportedly did not enjoy the shooting of the film and clashed with Gondry.
* Jane Adams as Carrie Eakin: Joel Barish&#x27;s friend. She is in a troubled relationship with Rob Eakin.
* David Cross as Rob Eakin: Joel Barish&#x27;s friend. In a troubled relationship with Carrie Eakin.
* Deirdre O&#x27;Connell as Hollis Mierzwiak: Howard Mierzwiak&#x27;s wife
* Thomas Jay Ryan as Frank: Joel Barish&#x27;s neighbor
* Debbon Ayer as Joel Barish&#x27;s mother
* Ellen Pompeo as Naomi, Joel Barish&#x27;s girlfriend (deleted scene)

==Production==
=== Development ===
The concept of &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; came from conversations between director Michel Gondry and co-writer Pierre Bismuth in 1998. The pair had met and become friends in the early 1980s during Gondry&#x27;s drumming career in the French pop group Oui Oui. Bismuth had conceived of the idea of erasing certain people from people&#x27;s minds in response to a friend complaining about her boyfriend; when he asked her if she would erase that boyfriend from her memory, she said yes. Bismuth originally planned to conduct an art experiment involving sending cards to people saying someone they knew had erased the card&#x27;s recipient from their memory. When he mentioned this to Gondry, they developed it into a story based on the situations that would arise if it were scientifically possible. Bismuth never carried out his experiment.

Gondry approached writer Charlie Kaufman with this concept, and they developed it into a short pitch. While the writers did not believe the concept was marketable, a small bidding war began over the idea. Steve Golin of Propaganda Films purchased it on June 12, 1998, for a low seven-figure sum. Kaufman, who was responsible for writing the screenplay, did not begin immediately, instead opting to suspend writing while he was working on &quot;Adaptation&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, and &quot;Human Nature&quot;, the last of which Gondry directed as his directorial debut.

During this time, filmmaker Christopher Nolan released &quot;Memento&quot; (2000), which similarly deals with memory. Due to the similarities, Kaufman became worried and tried to pull out of the project, but Golin made him complete it. During writing, the pitch&#x27;s ownership changed several times resulting in Kaufman not having to deal with the studios until the end of the scriptwriting process. The final script made the studios nervous.

Kaufman did not want to make the film a thriller and wanted to downplay the science fiction aspects of memory erasure, focusing on the relationship. He had an &quot;enormous struggle&quot; while writing the script, particularly encountering two problems: showing &quot;the memories, Joel&#x27;s reactions to the memories, and Joel interacting with Clementine outside of the memories in the memories,&quot; and the fact that characters could refer in later scenes to already erased memories.

Kaufman resolved the first problem by making Joel lucid and able to comment on his memories and solved the second by making the memories degrade instead of immediately erasing, with complete erasure occurring at awakening. Kaufman&#x27;s original name for the screenplay was 18 words long, as he had wanted a title that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t possibly fit on a marquee.&quot; He eventually decided on &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;, a title originating from the 1717 poem &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot; by Alexander Pope.

Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Je t&#x27;aime, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (1968) has been cited as an influence on the film.

=== Filming and post-production ===
The shooting of &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; began in mid-January 2003 after six weeks of preparation, lasting for three months on a budget of $20 million mostly in and around New York City. The film was shot on Fuji Reala 500D. The production crew recreated some key scenes, such as Joel&#x27;s Rockville Centre apartment and the 1950s-style kitchen, in a New Jersey former U.S. Navy base. The shoot was difficult, sometimes shooting for 17 hours per day in harsh environments.

The shoot was challenging for cinematographer Ellen Kuras, due to the difficulty of filming Gondry&#x27;s vision, which aimed to &quot;blend location-shoot authenticity with unpredictable flashes of whimsy&quot;. Gondry wanted available light used exclusively for the shoot. Kuras disagreed and worked around this idea by lighting the room instead of the actors and by hiding light bulbs around the set to increase light levels. Another issue the cinematographers encountered was that due to the frequent improvisation, the lack of marks and the few rehearsals completed, the cinematographers often did not know where the actors would be. Two handheld cameras filmed near 360-degree footage at all times, shooting 36,000 feet of film a day to deal with this. Gondry called back to the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard by filming using wheelchairs as well as using sled and chariot dollies instead of traditional dollies. When using wheelchairs, the shot was not consistently smooth; however, as Kuras liked the aesthetic of the low-angle, wobbly movement, the final film contains the footage.
The film used minimal CGI, with many effects accomplished in-camera through forced perspectives, hidden space, spotlighting, unsynchronized sound, split focus and continuity editing. A notable example is the ocean washing away the house in Montauk; the production team accomplished this by building the corner of a house on the beach and allowing the tide to rise. Executing this effect was difficult, as the special team hired to place the set in the water refused due to perceived dangers. In response, Gondry fired the team and had the production team, including the actors and producers, place the set in the water. In retaliation for Gondry&#x27;s actions, the chief of the union reprimanded Gondry in front of the crew.

Kaufman rewrote some of the script during production; thus, several differences exist between the production script and the final film. A fundamental difference is that in the production script, with the erasure of each memory, Clementine&#x27;s behavior is increasingly robotic. In the final film, Winslet plays Clementine straight, and degradation of settings and the intrusion of settings upon each other establish memory degradation visually. Another script component that did not make it into the final film was the appearance of Naomi, Joel&#x27;s girlfriend, played by Ellen Pompeo. Against Kaufman&#x27;s insistence on Naomi&#x27;s inclusion, the production team cut her already filmed scenes. Tracy Morgan was also cut from the film. In one version of the script, Kaufman began the story 50 years in the future. An old woman who turns out to be Mary tries to drop off a bulky manuscript at a publishing house, but the publisher declines her offer. We later learn that the manuscript contains all of the memories that Lacuna had erased from its patients. This version of the film ends with an elderly Clementine once again erasing Joel.

Valdís Óskarsdóttir edited the film, and she reportedly clashed with Gondry during editing. Kaufman was also very involved in the editing of the film. Editing was a long process as there was no requirement to rush it. There were a few test screenings of the film, which elicited positive reactions.

==Music==
The soundtrack for &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; was composed by Jon Brion, also featuring songs from artists including The Polyphonic Spree, The Willowz and Don Nelson. Hollywood Records released the soundtrack in March 2004. A cover version of The Korgis&#x27; &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot; with instrumentation by Brion and vocals by Beck operates as the soundtrack&#x27;s centerpiece, setting the film&#x27;s tone in the opening credits, and closing the film.

&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#x27;s&quot; soundtrack received generally positive reviews. AllMusic described Brion&#x27;s score as &quot;intimate&quot; and &quot;evocative of love and memories&quot;. Other positive reviews noted the ambient nature of the music and lauded Beck&#x27;s cover of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot;. The soundtrack&#x27;s detractors criticized the album&#x27;s lack of identity and its depressive atmosphere. Even among the detractors, the score&#x27;s ability to mesh with the plot was lauded, an appraisal common to many reviews.

== Analysis ==
Author Carol Vernallis, writing in &quot;Screen,&quot; argued that Gondry&#x27;s experience in directing music videos contributed to the film&#x27;s mise-en-scène and sound design. Vernallis describes some threads of the visual, aural, and musical motifs throughout the film, and how some motifs can work in counterpoint.

Philosopher Christopher Grau, in &quot;The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism&quot;, discussed how he perceived the film to have its own defined philosophy, beyond addressing ideas of a philosophical nature.

&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; has been aligned with a greater inspection, distinctly related to the 21st century, of memory, longing and nostalgia in science fiction films like &quot;Code 46&quot; and &quot;2046&quot;. The film showcases memory as fragmented and unreliable, evident by its non-linear structure.

== Release ==

=== Box office ===
Produced on a budget of $20 million, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; opened on March 19, 2004, in the United States, earning $8.2 million in its opening weekend from 1,353 theaters. The film placed seventh in the weekend&#x27;s box office, and remained in theaters for 19 weeks, earning $34.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $39.6 million in international markets, for a total of $74 million worldwide.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; has an approval rating of 92% based on 255 reviews, with an average score of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Propelled by Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s smart, imaginative script and Michel Gondry&#x27;s equally daring directorial touch, &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; is a twisty yet heartfelt look at relationships and heartache.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 89 out of 100, based on 41 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Despite jumping through the deliberately disorienting hoops of its story, &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; has an emotional center, and that&#x27;s what makes it work. Although Joel and Clementine ping-pong through various stages of romance and reality, what remains constant is the human need for love and companionship, and the human compulsion to keep seeking it, despite all odds.&quot; In 2010, he added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; canon, writing &quot;The wisdom in &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; is how it illuminates the way memory interacts with love. We more readily recall pleasure than pain. From the hospital I remember laughing nurses and not sleepless nights. A drunk remembers the good times better than the hangovers. A failed political candidate remembers the applause. An unsuccessful romantic lover remembers the times when it worked.&quot; A. O. Scott praised it as &quot;cerebral, formally and conceptually complicated, dense with literary allusions and as unabashedly romantic as any movie you&#x27;ll ever see&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; concluded: &quot;the formidable Gondry/Kaufman/Carrey/Winslet axis works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one&#x27;s own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart&quot;. In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it one of the greatest films of the 21st Century so far: &quot;Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s writing has the perfect equipoise of cynicism and sensitivity, and finds a perfect correlative in the director Michel Gondry&#x27;s whimsical ingenuity. The only thing better than seeing it again would be wiping it from your memory and rediscovering it for the first time.&quot; Ross Douthat included it on his list, calling it &quot;The most complete and accessible and moving Charlie Kaufman movie&quot;.

Winslet and Carrey received widespread praise for their performances. Winslet received multiple award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role and a Golden Globe Award nomination. &quot;Premiere&quot; placed her performance 81st in their 2008 list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. Claudia Puig wrote: &quot;Winslet is wonderful as a free spirit whose hair color changes along with her moods. She hasn&#x27;t had such a meaty role in a while, and she plays it just right&quot;. Ann Hornaday, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, said &quot;Even when forced to wear costumes and wigs that make her look like Pippi Longstocking after an acid-fueled trip to the thrift market, Winslet maintains a reassuring equilibrium. It takes an actor of her steadiness to play someone this unhinged.&quot;

Carrey also received multiple award nominations, including a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role and a Golden Globe nomination. Many reviewers noted his casting against type. Jason Killingsworth wrote: &quot;Carrey nails the part, winning audience sympathy from the opening moments of the film&quot;. Moira MacDonald in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; stated &quot;[Jim Carrey is] not bad at all — in fact, it&#x27;s the most honest, vulnerable work he&#x27;s ever done&quot;, while David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; said &quot;It&#x27;s rarely a compliment when I refer to an actor as &quot;straitjacketed&quot;, but the straitjacketing of Jim Carrey is fiercely poignant. You see all that manic comic energy imprisoned in this ordinary man, with the anarchism peeking out and trying to find a way to express itself.&quot; The supporting cast also received acclaim, with several reviewers, including Hornaday and Rick Groen of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; singling out Ruffalo&#x27;s performance for praise.

Critics praised Kaufman, and he won numerous awards, including an Academy Award and a BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. In &quot;Slate, &quot;David Edelstein claimed Kaufman had &quot;move[d] the boundary posts of romantic comedy,&quot; and Moira MacDonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called Kaufman &quot;one of the few creative screenwriters working today.&quot; Kaufman&#x27;s writing received criticism, with John Powers of the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; claiming it lacked passion and Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Observer&quot; criticizing the film&#x27;s &quot;nonexistent character development.&quot;

Gondry received praise, with Hornaday writing &quot;the results [of Gondry using primarily in-camera effects], in their intricate detail and execution&quot; as &quot;nothing short of brilliant&quot;. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; in their review stated &quot;Gondry ... makes it all a melancholy fun house, with camera work and visual tricks that rival the screenplay in invention&quot;. Cinematographer Ellen Kuras received praise for her work on the film; in an overall negative review, Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; praised Kuras for giving &quot;the movie a look of dreamy urgency that&#x27;s perfect for the story&quot;.

&quot;The A. V. Club&quot; placed it first on its list of the best films of the 2000s, writing: &quot;Though Kaufman is hardly a purely cerebral writer, his philosophical inquiries find an added emotional weight under Gondry&#x27;s direction. Portraying the fading and flaring of love in gargantuan bookstores and on railway lines, Gondry captures a moment that&#x27;s quintessentially of the 21st century, and yet timeless. In 2000, the calendar rolled over to a new millennium. With it came a symbolic break with the past, but our old passions and conflicts reasserted themselves seemingly at the stroke of midnight. So it is with &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;″s lovers, whose circular path brings them back together for an ending that&#x27;s ambiguous but guardedly hopeful about the possibility of a future not necessarily doomed to reprise the hurt of the past, though it also may well revisit the same mistakes. It&#x27;s the rare film that shows us who we are now and who we&#x27;re likely, for better or worse, forever to be.&quot;

South Korean singer-songwriter Taeyeon took inspiration from the film in the music video for her song &quot;What Do I Call You&quot;, the title track on her 2020 EP with the same name.

South Korean rapper and singer-songwriter B.I said that the film inspired his song &quot;Tangerine&quot;, the fourth track on his 2022 release &quot;Love or Loved Part.1&quot;.

American singer-songwriter Ariana Grande titled her 2024 album &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; after the film. Her music videos for the songs &quot;Yes, And?&quot; and &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)&quot;, as well as the rest of the album&#x27;s songs, contain references to the film.

===Video games===

Kan Gao, founder of Freebird Games, said his video game &quot;To the Moon&quot;, which is about two doctors traversing through the memory of an old man to fulfill his last wish, was inspired by the film.

<text>Acacia aneura, commonly known as mulga, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to inland Australia. It is a variable shrub or small tree with flat, narrowly linear to elliptic phyllodes, cylindrical spikes of bright yellow flowers and more or less flat and straight, leathery pods.

==Description==
&quot;Acacia aneura&quot; is a variable shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes up to and is often multistemmed with a bushy crown. Its phyllodes are flat, narrowly linear to narrowly elliptic, long and mostly wide, straight or slightly curved. The flowers are borne in a cylindrical head in the axils of phyllodes on a hairy peduncle long. The heads are long and bright yellow. Flowering occurs from March to May or August and the pod is more or less straight and flat, long and wide with a winged edge. The pods are papery, brown to greyish-brown, containing elliptic to oblong or egg-shaped seeds long and with a small whitich or cream-coloured aril.

Aboriginal peoples of the Coober Pedy area in South Australia refer to mulga trees as &quot;Umoona&quot;, which means &quot;long life&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Acacia aneura&quot; was first formally described in 1855 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. Bentham&#x27;s description was published in &quot;Linnaea: Ein Journal für die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beiträge zur Pflanzenkunde&quot;. The specific epithet (&quot;aneura&quot;) means &#x27;without nerves&#x27;, referring to the phyllodes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Mulga is endemic to Australia, and is found in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In Western Australia it grows in a variety of soils and habitats in the Central Ranges, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Murchison, Nullarbor, Pilbara and Tanami bioregions.

In the Northern Territory it occurs in the Burt Plain, Central Ranges, Channel Country, Davenport Murchison Ranges, Finke, Gawler, Gibson Desert, Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert, MacDonnell Ranges, Mitchell Grass Downs, Mount Isa Inlier, Murchison, Pilbara, Simpson Strzelecki Dunefields, Stony Plains and Tanami bioregions.

In South Australia, mulga occurs in scattered population in the north-west of that state and in Queensland it is found in the south-west, but also extend northwards through the Mitchell Grass Downs bioregion and west into the Channel Country.

In New South Wales, &quot;Acacia aneura&quot; is mainly found west from Nyngan and Griffith and possibly as far east as the Hunter Valley.

==Habitat and ecology==
Mulga savanna and mulga codominant tussock grasslands cover roughly 20% of the Australian continent, or about 1.5 million square kilometres. The mean rainfall for much of the habitat for &quot;A. aneura&quot; in Australia is roughly 200–250 mm/year, but it goes to as high as 500 mm/year in New South Wales and Queensland. The lowest mean rainfall where it grows is about 50–60 mm/year. Both summer and winter rainfall are necessary to maintain mulga, and the species is absent from semiarid regions that experience summer or winter drought.

Mulga scrub is distinctive and widespread, with the Mulga Lands of eastern Australia defined as a specific bioregion. The dominant species in these woodlands is mulga, with poplar box (&quot;Eucalyptus populnea&quot;) forming an increasingly important codominant in the eastern districts. The extent of ground cover in mulga woodlands varies with canopy density of the overstorey, becoming almost nonexistent in extremely dense stands. In more open stands, the herbaceous layer consists of wire grasses (&quot;Aristida&quot; spp.), mulga oats (&quot;Monocather&quot; sp.), mulga mitchell (&quot;Thyridolepis&quot; sp.), wanderrie (&quot;Eriachne&quot; spp.), finger grasses (&quot;Digitaria&quot; spp.) and love grasses (&quot;Eragrostis&quot; spp.). Various other woody species are also significant in mulga woodlands, particularly hop bushes (&quot;Dodonaea&quot; spp.), &quot;Eremophila&quot; and cassia (&quot;Senna&quot; spp.).

In contrast to the eucalypt woodlands that dominate much of Australia, mulga woodlands are not well adapted to regular fire and species in mulga communities vary in their ability to survive fires. Many species, including mulga, have a very limited ability to resprout after fire, and rely instead on mechanisms of seed production for species survival. Many plants produce hard, woody fruits or seeds, which can not only survive intense heat, but also may require the stimulus of fire to scarify and promote germination. Long-lived seed stores in soil is also common in these woodlands.

==Uses==
===Agriculture===
Mulga can be planted with sandalwood in plantations as a host tree. The flowers provide forage for bees, especially when there is enough water available.

Mulga is of great economic importance to the Australian pastoral industry. Despite containing considerable amounts of indigestible tannins, mulga leaves are a valuable fodder source, particularly in times of drought, as they are palatable to stock and provide up to 12% crude protein.

The seeds of &quot;Acacia aneura&quot; are traditionally used to make seedcakes. The mulga apple is an insect gall commonly eaten by Aboriginal people. Mulga tree gum (&quot;ngkwarle alkerampwe&quot; in the Arrernte language) is a type of lerp scale found on mulga branches. It provides a tasty, honey-like treat.

===Wood===
Wood from &quot;Acacia aneura&quot; stands up very well to being buried in soil, so it is used for posts. The wood has a density of about 850–1100 kg/m3. It is also good as firewood, and good-quality charcoal can be produced from it.

Mulga is a vital tree to Aboriginal Australians in central and Western Australia; the wood is a good hardwood for making various implements, such as digging sticks, woomeras, shields and wooden bowls.

<text>The New Party was a political party briefly active in the United Kingdom in the early 1930s. It was formed by Sir Oswald Mosley, an MP who had belonged to both the Conservative and Labour parties, quitting Labour after its 1930 conference narrowly rejected his &quot;Mosley Memorandum&quot;, a document he had written outlining how he would deal with the problem of unemployment.

==Mosley Memorandum==
On 6 December 1930, Mosley published an expanded version of the &quot;Mosley Memorandum&quot;, which was signed by Mosley, his wife and fellow Labour MP Lady Cynthia and 15 other Labour MPs: Oliver Baldwin, Joseph Batey, Aneurin Bevan, W. J. Brown, William Cove, Robert Forgan, J. F. Horrabin, James Lovat-Fraser, John McGovern, John James McShane, Frank Markham, H. T. Muggeridge, Morgan Philips Price, Charles Simmons, and John Strachey. It was also signed by A. J. Cook, general secretary of the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain.

==Founding the New Party==

On 28 February 1931 Mosley resigned from the Labour Party, launching the New Party the following day. The party was formed from six of the Labour MPs who signed the Mosley Manifesto (Mosley and his wife, Baldwin, Brown, Forgan and Strachey), although two (Baldwin and Brown) resigned membership after a day and sat in the House of Commons as independent MPs; Strachey resigned in June. The party received £50,000 funding from Lord Nuffield and launched a magazine called &quot;Action&quot;, edited by Harold Nicolson. In addition, Nicolson produced a New Party propaganda film titled &quot;Crisis&quot; and aimed to get it shown in the cinemas but the censors banned the film as it was considered it would &quot;bring Parliament into disrepute&quot; due to its depiction of MPs asleep on the benches. In the event the film was only shown at New Party meetings.
Mosley also set up a party militia, the &quot;Biff Boys&quot; led by the England rugby captain Peter Howard.

The New Party&#x27;s first electoral contest was at the Ashton-under-Lyne by-election in April 1931. The candidate was Allan Young, and his election agent was Wilfred Risdon. With a threadbare organisation they polled some 16% of the vote, splitting the Labour vote and allowing a Conservative to be returned to the Commons. Two more MPs joined the New Party later in 1931: W. E. D. Allen from the Unionists and Cecil Dudgeon from the Liberals. At the 1931 general election the New Party contested 25 seats, but only Mosley himself, and a candidate in Merthyr Tydfil (Sellick Davies stood against only one Independent Labour Party (ILP) candidate in Merthyr, while Mosley stood against both Conservative and Labour candidates in Stoke) polled a decent number of votes, and three candidates lost their deposits. Mosley&#x27;s New Party general election campaign received prominent press coverage in various national newspapers during 1931 with &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; reporting that &quot;The stewards were wearing rosettes of black and amber – the Mosley colours. Busy bees, hiving the honey of prosperity? That may be the symbolism of it.&quot;

==Policies==
The New Party programme was built on the &quot;Mosley Memorandum&quot;, advocating a national policy to meet the economic crisis that the Great Depression had brought. His desire for complete control of policy making decisions in the New Party led many members to resign membership. He favoured granting wide powers to the government, with only general control by Parliament, and creating a five-member Cabinet without specific portfolio, similar to the War Cabinet adopted during the First World War. His economic strategy broadly followed Keynesian thinking and suggested widespread investment into housing to provide work and improve housing standards overall and also supporting protectionism with proposals for high tariff walls.

==Demise==
After the election, Mosley toured Europe and became convinced of the virtues of fascism. Gradually, the New Party became more authoritarian, with parts of it, notably its youth movement NUPA, adopting overtly fascist thinking and the wearing of &quot;Greyshirt&quot; uniforms. The New Party&#x27;s sharp turn to fascism led previous supporters such as John Strachey and Harold Nicolson to leave it. In 1932, Mosley united most of the various British fascist organisations to form the British Union of Fascists into which the New Party subsumed itself. Out of the Scottish section was formed the Scottish Democratic Fascist Party, headed by William Weir Gilmour.

An unrelated New Party was launched in Britain in 2003.

<text>In mathematics, to solve an equation is to find its solutions, which are the values (numbers, functions, sets, etc.) that fulfill the condition stated by the equation, consisting generally of two expressions related by an equals sign. When seeking a solution, one or more variables are designated as &quot;unknowns&quot;. A solution is an assignment of values to the unknown variables that makes the equality in the equation true. In other words, a solution is a value or a collection of values (one for each unknown) such that, when substituted for the unknowns, the equation becomes an equality.
A solution of an equation is often called a root of the equation, particularly but not only for polynomial equations. The set of all solutions of an equation is its solution set.

An equation may be solved either numerically or symbolically. Solving an equation &quot;numerically&quot; means that only numbers are admitted as solutions. Solving an equation &quot;symbolically&quot; means that expressions can be used for representing the solutions.

For example, the equation is solved for the unknown by the expression , because substituting for in the equation results in , a true statement. It is also possible to take the variable to be the unknown, and then the equation is solved by . Or and can both be treated as unknowns, and then there are many solutions to the equation; a symbolic solution is , where the variable may take any value. Instantiating a symbolic solution with specific numbers gives a numerical solution; for example, gives (that is, ), and gives . 

The distinction between known variables and unknown variables is generally made in the statement of the problem, by phrases such as &quot;an equation &quot;in&quot; and &quot;, or &quot;solve &quot;for&quot; and &quot;, which indicate the unknowns, here and .
However, it is common to reserve , , , ... to denote the unknowns, and to use , , , ... to denote the known variables, which are often called parameters. This is typically the case when considering polynomial equations, such as quadratic equations. However, for some problems, all variables may assume either role.

Depending on the context, solving an equation may consist to find either any solution (finding a single solution is enough), all solutions, or a solution that satisfies further properties, such as belonging to a given interval. When the task is to find the solution that is the &quot;best&quot; under some criterion, this is an optimization problem. Solving an optimization problem is generally not referred to as &quot;equation solving&quot;, as, generally, solving methods start from a particular solution for finding a better solution, and repeating the process until finding eventually the best solution.

==Overview==
One general form of an equation is
:formula_1
where is a function, are the unknowns, and is a constant. Its solutions are the elements of the inverse image (fiber)
:formula_2
where is the domain of the function . The set of solutions can be the empty set (there are no solutions), a singleton (there is exactly one solution), finite, or infinite (there are infinitely many solutions).

For example, an equation such as
:formula_3
with unknowns and , can be put in the above form by subtracting from both sides of the equation, to obtain
:formula_4

In this particular case there is not just &quot;one&quot; solution, but an infinite set of solutions, which can be written using set builder notation as
:formula_5

One particular solution is . Two other solutions are , and . There is a unique plane in three-dimensional space which passes through the three points with these coordinates, and this plane is the set of all points whose coordinates are solutions of the equation.

==Solution sets==
The solution set of a given set of equations or inequalities is the set of all its solutions, a solution being a tuple of values, one for each unknown, that satisfies all the equations or inequalities.
If the solution set is empty, then there are no values of the unknowns that satisfy simultaneously all equations and inequalities.

For a simple example, consider the equation 
:formula_6
This equation can be viewed as a Diophantine equation, that is, an equation for which only integer solutions are sought. In this case, the solution set is the empty set, since 2 is not the square of an integer. However, if one searches for real solutions, there are two solutions, and ; in other words, the solution set is .

When an equation contains several unknowns, and when one has several equations with more unknowns than equations, the solution set is often infinite. In this case, the solutions cannot be listed. For representing them, a parametrization is often useful, which consists of expressing the solutions in terms of some of the unknowns or auxiliary variables. This is always possible when all the equations are linear.

Such infinite solution sets can naturally be interpreted as geometric shapes such as lines, curves (see picture), planes, and more generally algebraic varieties or manifolds. In particular, algebraic geometry may be viewed as the study of solution sets of algebraic equations.

== Methods of solution ==

The methods for solving equations generally depend on the type of equation, both the kind of expressions in the equation and the kind of values that may be assumed by the unknowns. The variety in types of equations is large, and so are the corresponding methods. Only a few specific types are mentioned below.

In general, given a class of equations, there may be no known systematic method (algorithm) that is guaranteed to work. This may be due to a lack of mathematical knowledge; some problems were only solved after centuries of effort. But this also reflects that, in general, no such method can exist: some problems are known to be unsolvable by an algorithm, such as Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem, which was proved unsolvable in 1970.

For several classes of equations, algorithms have been found for solving them, some of which have been implemented and incorporated in computer algebra systems, but often require no more sophisticated technology than pencil and paper. In some other cases, heuristic methods are known that are often successful but that are not guaranteed to lead to success.

===Brute force, trial and error, inspired guess===
If the solution set of an equation is restricted to a finite set (as is the case for equations in modular arithmetic, for example), or can be limited to a finite number of possibilities (as is the case with some Diophantine equations), the solution set can be found by brute force, that is, by testing each of the possible values (candidate solutions). It may be the case, though, that the number of possibilities to be considered, although finite, is so huge that an exhaustive search is not practically feasible; this is, in fact, a requirement for strong encryption methods.

As with all kinds of problem solving, trial and error may sometimes yield a solution, in particular where the form of the equation, or its similarity to another equation with a known solution, may lead to an &quot;inspired guess&quot; at the solution. If a guess, when tested, fails to be a solution, consideration of the way in which it fails may lead to a modified guess.

===Elementary algebra===
Equations involving linear or simple rational functions of a single real-valued unknown, say , such as

:formula_7

can be solved using the methods of elementary algebra.

===Systems of linear equations===
Smaller systems of linear equations can be solved likewise by methods of elementary algebra. For solving larger systems, algorithms are used that are based on linear algebra. &quot;See Gaussian elimination and numerical solution of linear systems.&quot;

===Polynomial equations===
Polynomial equations of degree up to four can be solved exactly using algebraic methods, of which the quadratic formula is the simplest example. Polynomial equations with a degree of five or higher require in general numerical methods (see below) or special functions such as Bring radicals, although some specific cases may be solvable algebraically, for example
:formula_8
(by using the rational root theorem), and
:formula_9
(by using the substitution , which simplifies this to a quadratic equation in ).

===Diophantine equations===
In Diophantine equations the solutions are required to be integers. In some cases a brute force approach can be used, as mentioned above. In some other cases, in particular if the equation is in one unknown, it is possible to solve the equation for rational-valued unknowns (see Rational root theorem), and then find solutions to the Diophantine equation by restricting the solution set to integer-valued solutions. For example, the polynomial equation
:formula_10
has as rational solutions and , and so, viewed as a Diophantine equation, it has the unique solution .

In general, however, Diophantine equations are among the most difficult equations to solve.

===Inverse functions===

In the simple case of a function of one variable, say, , we can solve an equation of the form for some constant by considering what is known as the &quot;inverse function&quot; of .

Given a function , the inverse function, denoted and defined as , is a function such that

:formula_11

Now, if we apply the inverse function to both sides of , where is a constant value in , we obtain

:formula_12

and we have found the solution to the equation. However, depending on the function, the inverse may be difficult to be defined, or may not be a function on all of the set (only on some subset), and have many values at some point.

If just one solution will do, instead of the full solution set, it is actually sufficient if only the functional identity

:formula_13

holds. For example, the projection defined by has no post-inverse, but it has a pre-inverse defined by . Indeed, the equation is solved by

:formula_14

Examples of inverse functions include the th root (inverse of ); the logarithm (inverse of ); the inverse trigonometric functions; and Lambert&#x27;s function (inverse of ).

===Factorization===
If the left-hand side expression of an equation can be factorized as , the solution set of the original solution consists of the union of the solution sets of the two equations and .
For example, the equation
:formula_15
can be rewritten, using the identity as
:formula_16
which can be factorized into
:formula_17
The solutions are thus the solutions of the equation , and are thus the set
:formula_18

===Numerical methods===
With more complicated equations in real or complex numbers, simple methods to solve equations can fail. Often, root-finding algorithms like the Newton–Raphson method can be used to find a numerical solution to an equation, which, for some applications, can be entirely sufficient to solve some problem.
There are also numerical methods for systems of linear equations.

===Matrix equations===
Equations involving matrices and vectors of real numbers can often be solved by using methods from linear algebra.

===Differential equations===
There is a vast body of methods for solving various kinds of differential equations, both numerically and analytically. A particular class of problem that can be considered to belong here is integration, and the analytic methods for solving this kind of problems are now called symbolic integration. Solutions of differential equations can be &quot;implicit&quot; or &quot;explicit&quot;.

<text>Oryx and Crake is a 2003 novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. She has described the novel as speculative fiction and adventure romance, rather than pure science fiction, because it does not deal with things &quot;we can&#x27;t yet do or begin to do&quot;, yet goes beyond the amount of realism she associates with the novel form. It focuses on a lone character called Snowman, who finds himself in a bleak situation with only creatures called Crakers to keep him company. The reader learns of his past, as a boy called Jimmy, and of genetic experimentation and pharmaceutical engineering that occurred under the purview of Jimmy&#x27;s peer, Glenn &quot;Crake&quot;.

The book was first published by McClelland and Stewart. It was shortlisted for the 2003 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, as well as for the 2004 Orange Prize for Fiction. &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; is the first of the MaddAddam trilogy, followed by &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot; (2009) and &quot;MaddAddam&quot; (2013). It is the basis for the 2023 opera &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; composed by Søren Nils Eichberg.

==Plot summary==
The novel focuses on a character called &quot;Snowman&quot;, living in a post-apocalyptic world near a small group of primitive and innocent human-like creatures whom he calls &quot;Crakers&quot;. Flashbacks reveal that Snowman was once a boy named Jimmy who grew up in a world dominated by multinational corporations that built privileged walled compounds to isolate and protect their employees and the employees&#x27; families from a degenerating outside society. The companies had operated by developing and marketing advanced technology products such as medical treatments and genetically engineered hybrid animals, but now no other humans are evident, and the compounds have become decaying ruins.

Near starvation, Snowman decides to return to the ruins of a compound named RejoovenEsense to search for supplies, even though his excursion risks encountering dangers including feral populations of the hybridized animals. He concocts an explanation for the Crakers, who regard him as a teacher, and begins his foraging expedition.

In Snowman&#x27;s recollection of past events, Jimmy&#x27;s family moves to the HelthWyzer compound, where his father works as a genetic engineer. Jimmy meets and befriends a brilliant science student named Glenn. Jimmy begins to refer to him as Crake when he uses that name in an online trivia game called &quot;Extinctathon&quot;. Jimmy and Crake spend much of their leisure time playing online games, smoking &quot;skunkweed&quot;, and watching underground videos such as live executions, graphic surgery, Noodie News, frog squashing, and child pornography. During one of their child pornography viewings, Jimmy is very much lovestruck and horrified by the gazing eyes of a young girl seen in the porn known as Hott Tott.

After graduating from high school, Crake attends the highly respected Watson–Crick Institute, where he studies advanced bioengineering, but Jimmy ends up at the loathed Martha Graham Academy, where students study humanities, only valued for their propaganda applications. Jimmy gets a job writing ad copy, while Crake becomes a bioengineer at RejoovenEsense. Crake uses his prominent position to create the Crakers, peaceful, gentle, herbivorous humanoids, who have sexual intercourse only during limited polyandrous breeding seasons. His stated purpose for the Crakers, actually a deliberate deception, is to create &quot;floor models&quot; of all the possible options a family could choose in the genetic manipulation of their future children. Crake&#x27;s bio-engineering team consists of the most expert players gathered from the online &quot;Extinctathon&quot; community.

Crake tells Jimmy about another very important project, a Viagra-like super-pill called BlyssPluss, which also promises health and happiness, but secretly causes sterilization in order to address overpopulation. Crake officially hires Jimmy to help market it. At the Rejoov compound, Jimmy notices a human in the Craker habitat and thinks he recognizes her as the girl from the pornographic video. Seemingly unaware of Jimmy&#x27;s obsession with her, Crake explains that her name is Oryx and that he has hired her as a teacher for the Crakers. Oryx notices Jimmy&#x27;s feelings for her and makes herself sexually available to him, despite also being Crake&#x27;s romantic partner. As their relationship progresses, Jimmy becomes increasingly fearful that Crake has found out about it or has known all along. He also makes a promise to both Oryx and Crake that he will look after the Crakers if anything happens to them.

After Crake&#x27;s wonder drug BlyssPluss is widely distributed, a global pandemic breaks out and begins wiping out the human race and causing mass chaos outside of the protected Rejoov compound. Realizing that the pandemic had been deliberately introduced by Crake and was distributed by including it within BlyssPluss, and sensing further immediate danger, Jimmy grabs a gun and goes to confront Crake, who is returning with Oryx from outside the compound and needs Jimmy to let them in. Crake presents himself to Jimmy with his arm around an unconscious Oryx, saying that he and Jimmy are immune to the virus. Jimmy lets them in, whereupon Crake slits Oryx&#x27;s throat with a knife. Jimmy then immediately shoots Crake dead.

During Snowman&#x27;s journey to scavenge supplies, he encounters aggressive hybrid animals and retreats into the RejoovenEsense compound. He finds some indications that other humans have survived seeing smoke on the horizon near the compound and briefly hearing voices on radio receivers in the compound. He carelessly breaks a scavenged bourbon bottle after binge drinking its content, and cuts his foot on a sliver of the glass. The cut becomes infected. His treatment of the wound with the medications he can find has some initial success, but the infection later gets worse again. He returns to the Crakers&#x27; camp and learns that three other humans have recently encountered the Crakers and are camping nearby. Snowman follows the smoke to where they are gathered around a campfire. Snowman is unsure of what to do, and considers killing them. Whether he kills them, introduces himself or quietly flees, and whatever happens afterwards, is left open to question at the end of the book.

== Main characters ==
* Snowman, whose original name is Jimmy, is the main protagonist; the story is told from his perspective. The name &quot;Snowman&quot; is short for &quot;abominable Snowman&quot;, a reference to the Yeti, a mythical ape-like creature of the Himalaya. For the online-game &quot;Extinctathon&quot;, Jimmy temporarily also has the animal code name &quot;Thickney&quot; (bush thick-knee or bush stone-curlew, &quot;Burhinus grallarius&quot;), which Crake chooses for Jimmy from an Australian bird known for inhabiting cemeteries (p. 81).
* Crake, whose original name is Glenn, is Jimmy&#x27;s childhood friend; an excellent student in high school, he becomes a brilliant geneticist and eventual mad scientist. He devises a plan to rid the Earth of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and replace this destructive, poorly designed species with a more peaceful and environmentally friendly version. His player-name in &quot;Extinctathon&quot; is from the red-necked crake, a small Australian bird. In Robin Elliott&#x27;s essay on Atwood, he explains the parallels between Glenn and the famous pianist Glenn Gould: the novel states that Glenn is named after a famous pianist, and Atwood has explained that Glenn has Asperger syndrome, which Gould is suspected to have also had.
* Oryx is a mysterious woman, recognized by Jimmy and Crake as the waif-like girl from a child pornography site. Crake hires her for sexual services and as a teacher to the Crakers, but she secretly becomes Jimmy&#x27;s lover as well. After the catastrophe, her memory continues to haunt Snowman. Her name is from the oryx, an African antelope: &quot;It&#x27;s not even her real name, which he&#x27;d never known anyway; it&#x27;s only a word. It&#x27;s a mantra&quot; (p. 110). She is described as likely originating from the South or South-East Asian region.
* Sharon is Jimmy&#x27;s mother. She once worked at OrganInc, like her husband, but stopped due to an untreated nervous breakdown related to her opposition to the bio-corporations&#x27; business. She is depressed and often fights with Jimmy&#x27;s father. Jimmy vies for his mother&#x27;s attention, but she spends much of her time sitting in her bathrobe and smoking. Eventually, Sharon runs away from the HelthWyzer compound, abandoning her son and taking his treasured genetically engineered pet rakunk [a genetic splice between a raccoon and a skunk] named &quot;Killer&quot;. She takes up with various underground opposition groups and is hunted by the deadly CorpSeCorps corporate security services. Jimmy is haunted by his mother&#x27;s absence and is visited often by CorpSeCorps inspectors attempting to track her whereabouts.
* Jimmy&#x27;s father, unnamed in the book, works first for OrganInc and later for HelthWyzer as a scientist. He is heavily involved in the development of pigoons (genetically engineered pigs that produce organs for human transplants). He is more pragmatic about the morality of genetic splicing than his wife. After Jimmy&#x27;s mother deserts the compound, he pursues a relationship with his laboratory technician, Ramona, and they eventually marry.
* Ramona is one of Jimmy&#x27;s father&#x27;s lab technicians at OrganInc. Ramona, Jimmy, and Jimmy&#x27;s father frequently go out to eat together. When Jimmy&#x27;s father leaves OrganInc to accept a new position at HelthWyzer, Ramona makes the move with him. After Jimmy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mysterious departure, Ramona moves in and takes on a motherly role in Jimmy&#x27;s life.

== Beginnings ==

Margaret Atwood started writing the novel much earlier than she expected, while still on a book tour for her previous novel, &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;. In March 2001, Atwood found herself in the Northern region of Australia, birdwatching with her partner during a break from the book tour. Here, while watching the red-necked crakes in their natural habitat, she was struck with inspiration for the story. However, Atwood explained that the work was also a product of her lingering thoughts on such a scenario throughout her life, as well as spending a great amount of time with scientists throughout her childhood. She stated

Several of my close relatives are scientists, and the main topic at the annual family Christmas dinner is likely to be intestinal parasites or sex hormones in mice, or, when that makes the non-scientists too queasy, the nature of the Universe.

Atwood continued to write the novel through the summer of 2001 while visiting the Arctic North, witnessing global warming&#x27;s effect on the region. However, shaken by the September 11 attacks, she stopped writing for a few weeks in the autumn, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s deeply unsettling when you&#x27;re writing about a fictional catastrophe and then a real one happens&quot;. However, with the looming questions of the end, Atwood finished the novel for release in 2003. These questions in &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, Atwood explained, are &quot;simply, What if we continue down the road we&#x27;re already on? How slippery is the slope? What are our saving graces? Who&#x27;s got the will to stop us?&quot;

==Allusions and references==

===To other works===

The cover of some editions contains a portion of the left panel of Hieronymous Bosch&#x27;s painting &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;. The cover of other editions contains a modified portion of Lucas Cranach the Elder&#x27;s painting &quot;The Fall&quot;.

The French translation of the title to &quot;Le dernier homme&quot; (&quot;The Last Man&quot;) is an allusion to Mary Shelley&#x27;s work of the same name, both set in the apocalyptic genre as a plague results in the near-extinction of humanity.

In the first chapter, Snowman utters a reference from Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot;:
&quot;It is the strict adherence to daily routine that tends towards the maintenance of good morale and the preservation of sanity,&quot; he says out loud. He has the feeling he&#x27;s quoting from a book, some obsolete, ponderous directive written in aid of European colonials running plantations of one kind or another.

One of Snowman&#x27;s musings, &quot;Now I&#x27;m alone [...] All, all alone. Alone on a wide, wide sea&quot; is an allusion to part four of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

In chapter 5 (subsection &quot;Bottle&quot;) is &quot;Out, out, brief candle&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

Crake finds, as Hamlet does, that his father was probably killed by his mother and step father. Like Hamlet, he plots to avenge him.

===To scientific history===

The book alludes to green fluorescent protein multiple times. The Children of Crake are described having green eyes from a jellyfish protein, indicating that Crake used this gene in their creation. Green rabbits are wild animals in this world, alluding to Alba, a rabbit created by the scientist Louis-Marie Houdebine with the gfp gene in order to glow green.

== Reception ==
The book received mostly favourable reviews in the press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Spectator&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; reviews under &quot;Ok&quot;. &quot;The Herald&quot; assessed reviews as the &quot;critical thermometer&quot; of &quot;Warm&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s verdict reads: &quot;There are occasional flashes of Atwood&#x27;s sharp wit in this suffocatingly dark novel, but, these apart, it offers no morsel of amusement. Yet it lacks the narrative suspense needed wholly to capture the interest as fiction rather than as a clever exposition of science run amok&quot;. 

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; ranked the novel high among Atwood&#x27;s works and Helen Brown, for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, wrote &quot;The bioengineered apocalypse she imagines is impeccably researched and sickeningly possible: a direct consequence of short-term science outstripping long-term responsibility. And just like the post-nuclear totalitarian vision of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, this story is set in a society readers will recognise as only a few steps ahead of our own.&quot; For &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Lorrie Moore called the novel &quot;towering and intrepid&quot;. Moore wrote, &quot;Tonally, &#x27;Oryx and Crake&#x27; is a roller-coaster ride. The book proceeds from terrifying grimness, through lonely mournfulness, until, midway, a morbid silliness begins sporadically to assert itself, like someone, exhausted by bad news, hysterically succumbing to giggles at a funeral.&quot; Joyce Carol Oates noted that the novel is &quot;more ambitious and darkly prophetic&quot; than &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Oates called the work an &quot;ambitiously concerned, skillfully executed performance&quot;.

Joan Smith, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, faulted the novel&#x27;s uneven construction and lack of emotional depth. She concluded: &quot;In the end, Oryx and Crake is a parable, an imaginative text for the anti-globalisation movement that does not quite work as a novel.&quot;

In a review of &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot;, Ursula K. Le Guin defended the novel against criticism of its characters by suggesting the novel experiments with components of morality plays.

On 5 November 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels. The same year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included it on their list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.

Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s company Protozoa Pictures were developing a television adaptation of the entire MaddAddam trilogy, under the working title &quot;MaddAddam&quot;. Aronofsky was to serve as executive producer and possibly director, with the script written by playwright Eliza Clark. The project was formerly being developed for HBO; in 2016 Aronofsky said that the network was no longer attached, but confirmed that the scripts were written and the project was still underway. In January 2018, Paramount Television and Anonymous Content announced they had won the bidding war for rights to the trilogy and planned to bring the series to cable or video on demand. No network had yet agreed to carry the series.

== Censorship in the United States ==
&quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; is one of the most-banned books by school officials in the United States due to its adult themes and occasional pornographic material. In 2023, it was banned from school libraries by the school boards of Willard, Missouri and Hanover County, Virginia. That same year, the Beaufort County, South Carolina school district banned the book but then reversed the decision and returned it to high school library shelves. Officials in Forsyth County, Georgia did not ban &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; but did decide to require parental permission before a student could access it. In April 2024, it was banned in three large Texas school districts. 

In August 2024, it was one of 13 books banned statewide by Utah&#x27;s state board of education, allegedly for its &quot;objective sensitive material.&quot; In 2024 the book was banned in Texas by the Katy Independent School District on the basis that the novel is &quot;adopting, supporting, or promoting gender fluidity&quot; despite also pronouncing a bullying policy that protects infringements on the rights of the student. 

== Sequels ==

&quot;The Year of the Flood&quot; was released on 7 September 2009 in the United Kingdom, and 22 September 2009 in Canada and the United States. Though chronicling a different set of characters, the follow-up expands upon and clarifies the relationships of Crake with Oryx and Jimmy with his high school girlfriend Ren. Glenn makes a brief appearance. It also identifies the three characters introduced at the end of the original, and finishes the cliffhanger ending.

The third book in the series, &quot;MaddAddam&quot;, was published in August 2013.

==Adaptation==
In 2023, the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden premiered an opera based on the novel, composed by Søren Nils Eichberg, conducted by Albert Horne and directed by Daniela Kerck.

<text>The Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public (, &quot;Antisionistsky komitet sovyetskoy obshchestvennosti&quot;; abbreviated AZCSP ) was a body formed in 1983 in the Soviet Union as an anti-Zionist propaganda tool. Formation of AZCSP was approved on 29 March 1983 by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in resolution 101/62ГС: &quot;Support the proposition of the Department of Propaganda of the Central Committee and the KGB USSR about the creation of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public...&quot;

== Anti-Zionist manifesto ==
On 1 April 1983, the CPSU official newspaper, &quot;Pravda&quot;, ran a full front-page article titled &quot;From the Soviet Leadership&quot;:
: &quot;...By its nature, Zionism concentrates ultra-nationalism, chauvinism and racial intolerance, excuse for territorial occupation and annexation, military opportunism, cult of political promiscuousness and irresponsibility, demagogy and ideological diversion, dirty tactics and perfidy... Absurd are attempts of Zionist ideologists to present those who criticize them, or condemn the aggressive politics of Israel&#x27;s ruling circles, as antisemitic... We call on all Soviet citizens: workers, peasants, representatives of intelligentsia: take active part in exposing Zionism, strongly rebuke its endeavors; social scientists: activate scientific research to criticize the reactionary core of that ideology and aggressive character of its political practice; writers, artists, journalists: to more fully expose the anti-populace and anti-humane diversionary character of the propaganda and politics of Zionism...&quot; (highlights preserved)

The fundamental idea of the anti-Zionist manifesto was that potential Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union were to be considered enemies of the Soviet Union. The anti-Zionist manifesto was signed by 8 anti-Zionist Jews:
*David Abramovich Dragunsky, Colonel-General, twice the Hero of the Soviet Union
*Samuel Zivs, law professor 
*Genrikh Gofman
*Yuri Kolesnikov 
*Martin Kabachnik, Lenin Prize winner 
*Gregory Bondarevsky, history professor 
*Boris Sheinin, filmmaker 
*Henrikas Zimanas, philosopher

== Background and history ==
From late 1944, Joseph Stalin adopted a pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would speed the decline of British influence in the Middle East. Accordingly, in November 1947, the Soviet Union, together with the other Soviet bloc countries, voted in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which paved the way for the creation of the State of Israel. On May 17, 1948, three days after Israel declared its independence, the Soviet Union officially granted de jure recognition of Israel, becoming only the second country to recognise the Jewish state (preceded only by the United States&#x27; &quot;de facto&quot; recognition) and the first country to grant Israel &quot;de jure&quot; recognition.

By 1983, the Soviet regime needed a new propaganda weapon in the Cold War, as well as against an increasingly active internal dissident movement, to arrest or discredit the mass emigration of Soviet Jews and to alleviate the Arab concerns about its effects on Israel&#x27;s demographics. By the dramatic stepping-up of &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; activities, the AZSCP was designed to solve these problems.

David Abramovich Dragunsky, Colonel-General, twice Hero of the Soviet Union and World War II hero (he was the commander of the 55th Guards Tank Brigade), well known inside the country and abroad, was designated its chairman.

The writers who specialized in the Soviet-invented and sponsored doctrine of &quot;Zionology&quot; (&quot;сионология&quot;) considered any expressions of Jewishness as Zionist and therefore subject to being stamped out. In November 1975, the leading Soviet historian academic M. Korostovtsev wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Central Committee, Mikhail Suslov, regarding the book &quot;The encroaching counterrevolution&quot; by prominent Zionologist Vladimir Begun: &quot;...it perceptibly stirs up anti-Semitism under the flag of anti-Zionism&quot;.

In addition to propaganda in the mass media and publishing, the AZCSP&#x27;s projects included the &quot;International symposium on contemporary problems of anti-Zionism&quot; and preparation for an &quot;International anti-Zionist congress&quot;.

By the end of the 1980s, with the new policies of glasnost and perestroika, and with the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union, the old Soviet regime had lost its stability and many of those plans had to be cancelled. Finally it was dismantled in October 1994.

Some materials produced by the AZCSP were used by ultra-nationalist groups such as Pamyat.

<doc id="537070" wikidata="Q77173" url="?curid=537070" title="Otto Loewi">
<text>Otto Loewi (; 3 June 1873 – 25 December 1961) was a German-born pharmacologist and psychobiologist who discovered the role of acetylcholine as an endogenous neurotransmitter. For this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936, which he shared with Sir Henry Dale, who was a lifelong friend that helped to inspire the neurotransmitter experiment. Loewi met Dale in 1902 when spending some months in Ernest Starling&#x27;s laboratory at University College, London.

== Biography ==
Loewi was born in Frankfurt, Germany on June 3, 1873 in a Jewish family. He went to study medicine at the University of Strasbourg, Germany (now part of France) in 1891, where he attended courses by famous professors Gustav Schwalbe, Oswald Schmiedeberg, and Bernhard Naunyn among others. He received his medical doctoral degree in 1896. He also was a member of the fraternity Burschenschaft Germania Strassburg.

Subsequently, he worked with Martin Freund at Goethe University of Frankfurt and with Franz Hofmeister in Strasbourg. From 1897 to 1898, he served as an assistant to Carl von Noorden, clinician at the City Hospital in Frankfurt. Soon, however, after seeing the high mortality in countless cases of far-advanced tuberculosis and pneumonia, left without any treatment because of lack of therapy, he decided to drop his intention to become a clinician and instead to carry out research in basic medical science, in particular pharmacology. In 1898, he became an assistant of Professor Hans Horst Meyer, the renowned pharmacologist at the University of Marburg. During his first years in Marburg, Loewi&#x27;s studies were in the field of metabolism. As a result of his work on the action of phlorhizin, a glucoside provoking glycosuria, and another one on nuclein metabolism in man, he was appointed «Privatdozent» (lecturer) in 1900. Two years later he published his paper «Über Eiweisssynthese im Tierkörper» (on protein synthesis in the animal body), proving that animals are able to rebuild their proteins from their degradation products, the amino acids – an essential discovery with regard to nutrition.
In 1902 Loewi was a guest researcher in Ernest Starling&#x27;s laboratory in London, where he met his lifelong friend Henry Dale.

In 1903, he accepted an appointment at the University of Graz in Austria, where he would remain until being forced out of the country in 1938. In 1905, Loewi became Associate Professor at Meyer&#x27;s laboratory and received Austrian citizenship. In 1909 he was appointed to the Chair of Pharmacology in Graz. He had also been a professor at the University of Vienna.

He married Guida Goldschmiedt (1889-1958) in 1908. They had three sons and a daughter. He was the last Jew hired by the University between 1903 and the end of the war.

In 1921, Loewi investigated how vital organs respond to chemical and electrical stimulation. He also established their relative dependence on epinephrine for proper function. Consequently, he learnt how nerve impulses are transmitted by chemical messengers. The first chemical neurotransmitter that he identified was acetylcholine.

After being arrested, along with two of his sons, on the night of the German invasion of Austria, March 11, 1938, Loewi was released after three months on condition that he &quot;voluntarily&quot; relinquish all his possessions, including his research, to the Nazis. He arrived to Britain in September 1938 and shortly afterwards he was offered a visiting professorship at the Université libre de Bruxelles via the Francqui Foundation.

After teaching one semester in the first half of 1939 and going on vacation in England he didn&#x27;t return to Brussels in September due to the outbreak of World War II. Loewi worked at the Nuffield Institute for Medical Research affiliated with Oxford before accepting an offer of a tenured research professor position at the New York University College of Medicine. He arrived to the US in June 1940 and was joined by his wife only in early 1941 (she wasn&#x27;t allowed to leave earlier).

In 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1954, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. He died in New York City on December 25, 1961.

Shortly after Loewi&#x27;s death in late 1961, his youngest son bestowed the gold Nobel medal on the Royal Society in London. He gave the Nobel diploma to the University of Graz in Austria in 1983, where it currently resides, along with a bronze copy of a bust of Loewi. The original of the bust is at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Loewi&#x27;s summer home from his arrival in the US until his death.

== Research ==

Before Loewi&#x27;s experiments, it was unclear whether signaling across the synapse was bioelectrical or chemical. While pharmacology experiments had established that physiological responses such as muscle contraction could be induced by chemical application, there was no evidence that cells released chemical substances to cause these responses. On the contrary, researchers had shown that physiological responses could be caused by applying an electrical impulse, which suggested that electrical transmission may be the only mode of endogenous signaling. In the early 20th century the controversy of whether cells used chemical or electrical transmission divided even the most prominent scientists.

Loewi&#x27;s famous experiment, published in 1921, largely answered this question. He dissected out of frogs two beating hearts: one with the vagus nerve which controls heart rate attached, the other heart on its own. Both hearts were bathed in a saline solution (i.e. Ringer&#x27;s solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first heart beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first heart and applied it to the second heart. The application of the liquid made the second heart also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the heart rate. He called the unknown chemical Vagusstoff, naming it after the nerve and the German word for substance. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to acetylcholine. His experiment was iconic because it was the first to demonstrate the endogenous release of a chemical substance that could cause a response in the absence of electrical stimulation. It paved the way for the understanding that the electrical signaling event (action potential) causes a chemical event (release of neurotransmitter from synapses) that is ultimately the effector on the tissue.

Loewi&#x27;s investigations &quot;On an augmentation of adrenaline release by cocaine&quot; and &quot;On the connection between digitalis and the action of calcium&quot; stimulated a considerable body of research in the years following their publication.

He also clarified two mechanisms of therapeutic importance: the blockade and the augmentation of nerve action by certain drugs.

Loewi is also known for the means by which the idea for his experiment came to him. On Easter Saturday 1921, he dreamed of an experiment that would prove once and for all that transmission of nerve impulses was chemical, not electrical. He woke up, scribbled the experiment onto a scrap of paper on his night-stand, and went back to sleep.

The next morning, he found, to his horror, that he couldn&#x27;t read his midnight scribbles. That day, he said, was the longest day of his life, as he could not remember his dream. That night, however, he had the same dream. This time, he immediately went to his lab to perform the experiment. From that point on, the consensus was that the Nobel was not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but of &quot;when.&quot;

Thirteen years later, Loewi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Sir Henry Hallett Dale.

== Loewi&#x27;s mydriatic test ==
Loewi observed that by removing the pancreas from dogs, it gave them an experimental form of diabetes, which led to a change of the response of the eye to adrenaline. This compound in normal dogs has no effect, but in the dogs without a pancreas the pupil dilated. 
This test involves instilling repeated doses of 1:1000 adrenaline solution into the eye and looking for pupillary dilation. Surgeons used this as a diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis, which was based on Loewi&#x27;s observation of such a phenomenon in dogs that had had their pancreas removed. The usefulness of this test was reported in a case series of two patients; it was, as expected, negative in a case involving carcinoma of the bile duct, but positive in a case of pancreatitis. The effectiveness of this test was subsequently investigated. The mechanism of action of this phenomenon is unclear, but has been attributed to &quot;a functional toxic disturbance of the sympathetic post-ganglionic neuron innervating the iris&quot;.

<text>Sustrans ( ) is a United Kingdom-based walking, wheeling and cycling charity, and the custodian of the National Cycle Network.

Its flagship project is the National Cycle Network, which has created of signed cycle routes throughout the United Kingdom, including of traffic-free paths. The rest of the network is on previously existing and mostly minor roads, in which motor traffic will be encountered.

In Scotland, Sustrans has established partnership teams, embedding officers in local councils as well as NHS Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, and Transport for Edinburgh.

==History==

Sustrans was formed in Bristol in July 1977 as Cyclebag by a group of cyclists and environmentalists, as a result of doubts about the desirability of dependence on the private car, following the 1973 oil crisis, and the almost total lack of specific provision for cyclists in most British cities, in contrast to some other European countries.

A decade earlier, the Beeching Axe closed many British railways that the government considered underused and too costly. One such railway was the former Midland Railway line between central Bristol and Bath, closed in favour of the more direct, former Great Western Railway between the cities. Led by John Grimshaw, Cyclebag leased part of the old route and together with many volunteers and the help of Avon County Council (Bristol and Bath were then part of the County of Avon) turned it into its first route, the Bristol &amp; Bath Railway Path.

In the early 1980s, when unemployment rose, the organisation took advantage of government schemes to provide temporary employment to build similar &quot;green routes&quot;. British Waterways and Cyclebag collaborated to improve towpaths along some canals, which resulted in increased use of the towpaths, especially by cyclists.

In 1983, the charity Sustrans was founded. It had 11 directors (trustees, members, and board members of the charity) chosen by the existing board. The executive board was composed of the chief executive, John Grimshaw, and one of the two company secretaries.

By the early 1990s, Sustrans had a growing number of supporters, and the network of national routes was emerging. In 1995, it was granted £43.5 million from the Millennium Lottery Fund to extend the National Cycle Network to smaller towns and rural areas, as well as launch the &quot;Safe Routes to Schools&quot; project, based on earlier state projects in Denmark.

The five-year project, Connect2 was launched in 2006, and it aimed at improving local travel in 79 communities by creating new walking and cycling routes. In 2007, it received £50 million from the Big Lottery&#x27;s &#x27;Living Landmarks; The People&#x27;s Millions&#x27; competition, following a public vote.

In 2015, Sustrans ran the Campaign for Safer Streets, which encouraged people to write to Prime Minister David Cameron to encourage him to commit to funding safer walking and cycling routes to schools.

In October 2015, Sustrans released its first Bike Life report. It was a survey of residents in seven UK cities, undertaken in conjunction with local councils and transport authorities, attempting to assess the current state of cycling in the UK. It covered areas such as safety, provision of cycling infrastructure and people&#x27;s attitudes towards cycling.

In 2020–2021, Sustrans&#x27; executive team had a combined payroll cost of , with its CEO receiving over .

==Funding==
The National Cycle Network was the first project to receive Millennium Commission funding in 1995. Sustrans has many sources of funding, and in the 2004/05 financial year, its income was £23.6 million: £2.1 million from supporters&#x27; donations, £8.5 million from the Department for Transport and a further £2.5 million from the National Opportunities Fund specifically for the Safe Routes projects. Additional funding comes from charitable grants and trusts, local government, and the sales of maps and books. In Scotland in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, £30 million of Spaces for People funding was granted to Sustrans by the Scottish Government to assist local authorities and statutory bodies in Scotland to provide safe walking and cycling infrastructure.

==National Cycle Network==


The National Cycle Network was officially opened in June 2000, when had been completed, although some routes had been open for over a decade. In 2005 the network reached . In urban areas, almost 20% of the network is free from motor traffic, though these sections can account for up to 80% of use. The more rural parts of the network see less motor traffic and are used primarily for leisure cycling.

Sustrans estimated that in 2005, the network carried 232,000,000 journeys by all classes of non-motorized users. In 2010, the figure had risen to over 420,000,000 journeys. The data collected by Sustrans to compile monitoring reports, from traffic counters and user surveys, showed that National Cycle Network usage is predominantly urban and on traffic-free sections. Furthermore, surveys show that only 35% of usage on urban sections of the NCN is for leisure purposes.
In 2018, Sustrans published the &quot;National Cycle Network Review: Paths for Everyone&quot; report which reviewed the quality and usage of the Network and set out a vision for its future. It estimated that in 2017–2018, 4.4 million users carried out 786 million cycling and walking trips on the Network.

==Criticism==
Sustrans has opponents within organisations that wish to reduce road haulage and motor travel by promoting the expansion of the modern railway network. It has also received criticism from members of the heritage railway movement. It has been accused of being uncompromising on route sharing; an example is the planned section of the Bodmin &amp; Wenford Railway between Boscarne Junction and Wadebridge.

In 2000, requests by EWS and English China Clays to reopen former rail links for freight paths such as the former Weedon to Leamington Spa line were objected to by the charity. Sustrans refused to support the application unless the rail promoter provided an alternative cycle track; EWS responded it was an uneconomic provision for both reopening and building replacement pathway expenses.

Sustrans have occasionally been criticised by other cycling organisations and activists over allegedly giving approval to cycle facilities regarded by critics as inadequate or dangerous, allowing local councils and similar bodies to reject criticism by pointing out that Sustrans have approved of the design being questioned. In 2013, for example, the Cycling Embassy of Great Britain criticised Sustrans for the extensive use of &quot;shared use&quot; provision—in which cycle routes are placed on pavements and footpaths without separation from pedestrians—in designs that Sustrans prepared for London. In 2016, the University of the West of England&#x27;s Centre for Transport and Society identified shared use designs, and in particular Sustrans Design Guidance which encouraged such designs, because shared-use paths can offer a source of conflict between pedestrians and cyclists. This is a cause for frustration among some campaigning for better cycling infrastructure provision.

<text>Lantmarskalk, (; ) was the title of one of the speakers of the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates, from 1627 to 1866 and of the Diet of Grand Duchy of Finland from 1809 to 1906. The Lantmarskalk was appointed by the Estate of the Nobles and also served as its speaker (talman). The Lantmarskalk should not be confused with the Riksmarsk (Lord High Constable of Sweden) or the Riksmarskalk (Marshal of the Realm), which were Great Officers of the Realm and royal appointees. 

Between approximately 1720 and 1772 two parties Hats and Caps were active during a short period of parliamentary rule, referred to as the age of liberty.

<doc id="537084" wikidata="Q3127368" url="?curid=537084" title="Harden, New South Wales">
<text>Harden–Murrumburrah is a town and community in the Hilltops Region and is located in the South West Slopes of New South Wales in Australia. Harden is adjacent to both the Canberra region of the Australian Capital Territory and the Riverina Region in the southwest area of NSW. The town is a twin town between Harden and Murrumburrah (which is noted as one of the earliest European immigrant settlements in the southwest of New South Wales).

The town is traversed by the Burley Griffin Way, the major link from and between the Riverina and the Hume Highway near Yass, and ultimately Sydney, Canberra and the coast. Cunningham Creek runs along the edge of the town.

The Olympic Highway traverses the western end of the shire and is the major link through the central west to the Blue Mountains and from there to the Sydney region.

Harden is 3½ hours away by road from Sydney, and 1½ hours from Canberra and Wagga Wagga.

==History==
Before European settlement the Harden area was inhabited by the Wiradjuri people. Hume and Hovell passed nearby in 1824. In the late 1820s, the &#x27;Murrumburra&#x27; was established. Its superintendent, James Kennedy, established an inn on the townsite in the late 1840s. Gold was found in the area in the 1850s.

Harden railway station was opened one km east of Murrumburrah on the Main Southern line in 1877 as Murrumburrah, but changed its name to Harden a year after the opening of a new station in Murrumburrah in 1879. Harden has remained as the main station and, as a result, became the main town.

A post office at Harden was opened on 1 January 1870, and in 1926 £2000 of funding was secured to provide extensive improvements to the ageing facility.

The first Australian Lighthorse was also founded in Harden–Murrumburrah, with the Lighthorse festival occurring annually.

From 1906 until 2016 Harden–Murrumburrah was the seat of its own local council, but was amalgamated in 2016 to form Hilltops Council.
The town&#x27;s rugby league team, the Harden-Murrumburrah Hawks, competed for the Maher Cup, and continue to compete in senior football today in the George Tooke Shield.

In 1996, a trust was formed through the last will and testament of Geoffrey Kruger, a retired dental surgeon who had lived in the town for much of his life, the Kruger Trust was intended to fund improvements to the town itself. The trust has funded key infrastructure in the town, such as a medical centre and community country club.

Harden is also home to Murrumburrah High School, which was established in 1977 and is currently the only secondary education facility for the town.

== Facilities ==
Harden boasts a variety of facilities servicing residents from both Harden, Murrumburrah and surrounds.

Harden experiences a climate typical of the South West Slopes, with a large seasonal variation throughout the year. Under Koppen it is classified as a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with warm to hot summers and cool, cloudy winters. On rare occasions it may snow.

Temperature data were collected from 1967 until 1980, and rainfall from 1886 until 2006.

<text>Blaque ( ) is an American girl group; they had songs chart from 1999 to 2004. Outside of the United States, they are known as Blaque Ivory. Their self-titled debut album &quot;Blaque&quot; sold more than 1 million copies and was certified Platinum. The group&#x27;s debut included the platinum-selling lead single &quot;808&quot;; a second single, &quot;I Do&quot;; and the international pop hit &quot;Bring It All to Me&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Blaque the 4th Best New Artist of the year, with &quot;Bring It All to Me&quot; landing at number 30 on the 2000 Year End Chart. In 2002 and 2003, the group released three less successful singles, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get It Back&quot;, &quot;Ugly&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Good&quot;, the latter appearing in the film &quot;Honey&quot;.

Blaque worked on two unreleased albums in the mid-to-late 2000s before they disbanded in 2008. The group attempted a comeback in 2012, but it was cut short by Natina Reed&#x27;s accidental death. In 2019, Blaque&#x27;s intended third album &quot;Torch&quot; was released under the label Blaque/The Move Entertainment.

== History ==
=== 1994–1996: Early beginnings ===
In 1994, Shamari Fears formed her first girl group with a rotation of members, including Atlanta high school classmate Natina Reed. They soon met a producer, who was looking for an urban country singing act and took them under his wings, naming the four member band Buutz. Still in training, Reed left the group a year later, after her father Paul, a reverend, no longer agreed with his daughter performing non-religious and secular music. After Reed&#x27;s departure, Fears connected with vocal coach and manager Cynnamyn Robinson who found a replacement member for Reed and re-named the band Intrigue. With the help of Robinson, the members of Intrigue received dancing and acting classes and were able to acquire further experience in the recording studio. In 1995, twelve-year-old Brandi Williams was added to the group but Intrigue still struggled to secure a record deal. 

As told on &quot;Unsung&quot; after her parents&#x27; divorce, Reed again began pursuing secular music and met talent scout Ronald Lopes, brother of Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes, while singing jingles to earn extra cash. Lopes, the co-owner of a production company named Blaque House, agreed to manage her and hired Reed to write for his sister&#x27;s band TLC. In the meantime, he was looking for &quot;an outlet&quot; for Reed, who suggested that he make her part of a new girl group and asked Fears to join the group. In turn, Fears inivited Williams to join. Named after Lopes&#x27; company, Blaque was officially formed in 1996. In hopes of securing the trio a jump start to their career, Lopes looked to his sister who began mentoring the group and arranged demo recordings and photo shootings for them. Six months after their formation, Left Eye had them audition for Sony Music CEO Tommy Mottola who offered Blaque a deal with Columbia Records.

=== 1997–2000: Debut and breakthrough ===
Fast-tracking the production of their debut album, Columbia Records set up recording sessions with several producers for the trio, with Jean-Claude Olivier and Samuel Barnes from hip hop production duo Trackmasters eventually emerging as the album&#x27;s executive producer alongside Left Eye and Cory Rooney.
In 1997, the group made a cameo appearance in the video for Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s &quot;Not Tonight (Remix)&quot;.

Their self-titled debut debuted at number 23 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and at number 53 on the official &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by RIAA. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;808&quot; was a success in the U.S. reaching number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and earning Gold certification. The follow-up single &quot;I Do&quot; was not a success like the previous singles, reaching number 73 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop single chart. The music video for &quot;I Do&quot; was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing. The last single &quot;Bring It All To Me&quot;, which featured JC Chasez, was a hit song that made the number 5 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and topped the Rhythmic charts in late 1999 to early 2000 for six weeks.

In mid-1999, Blaque toured as one of the opening acts for boy band &#x27;N Sync. Blaque also performed as one of the opening acts for TLC&#x27;s FanMail Tour later that year. In 2000, the group starred as cheerleaders in the film &quot;Bring It On&quot; and went to the studio and recorded the Shelly Peiken and Guy Roche song &quot;As If&quot; for the soundtrack that same year. A remixed version of the Blaque song &quot;Bring It All To Me&quot; appeared in the film, with added rapping by 50 Cent.

=== 2001–2002: &quot;Blaque Out&quot; ===
While their self-titled debut album went platinum, the second album called &quot;Blaque Out&quot;, which was set for release in 2001, was shelved as the group was dropped from Columbia Records for unknown reasons. The video for the first single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get It Back&quot; was never released. The album was soon leaked on the Internet. After Lopes&#x27; death in a car crash in Honduras on April 25, 2002, the group signed with Elektra Records. They began work on their third album after Reed gave birth to a son. An alternate version of the shelved album was released to iTunes on May 22, 2007, but was later taken down. In December 2011, &quot;Blaque Out&quot; was released back onto iTunes.

=== 2005–2012: Reunion, Reed&#x27;s death ===
Fears was signed to Darkchild Records in 2005. Williams also signed a new record deal and started working on a solo album. She also provided vocals on the hook of Nelly&#x27;s single &quot;Grillz&quot;. In 2005, Blaque came back together to record their studio album &quot;Private Show&quot; (originally titled &quot;Beauty&quot;). They worked on the album sporadically from 2005 to 2009. Blaque agreed to film a show &quot;Blaque In the House&quot; set to air in the summer of 2008; however, the show was never picked up, and the album went unreleased. Blaque released four songs on YouTube: &quot;Cut You Off&quot;, &quot;All Nighter&quot;, &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; and &quot;High Definition&quot; before they decided to disband.

On July 28, 2012, Blaque reunited for the Left Eye Music Festival in Decatur near northeast Atlanta. At the event, Blaque performed their single &quot;808&quot;. Shortly after, the group contracted with artist manager Inga &quot;Nandi&quot; Willis, and started working on an album and a reality television show. On October 26, 2012, Reed died after being hit by a car near Atlanta. The group broke up shortly after her death. Two days later, &quot;Cut You Off&quot;, a song intended for the album, leaked via the internet.

=== 2013–2019: &quot;Torch&quot;, change in lineup ===
Blaque&#x27;s intended third album, &quot;Torch&quot;, featured Missy Elliott, songwriter Linda Perry, and producer Rodney Jerkins. The intended single &quot;Blackout&quot; was derided as being a &quot;rip-off&quot; of 50 Cent&#x27;s song &quot;In da Club&quot;.

&quot;Torch&quot; was scheduled to be released exclusively to iTunes in 2008, nearly five years after its completion by Music World Entertainment, but that was canceled. It has been confirmed that Mathew Knowles owns the rights to the albums &quot;Torch&quot; and &quot;Blaque Out&quot;. On May 31, 2019, Blaque released &quot;Torch&quot; under the label Blaque/The Move Entertainment.

== Other media ==
In addition to being in music, Reed, Fears, and Williams appeared in the 2000 film &quot;Bring It On&quot; as members of the East Compton Clovers cheerleading squad, fronted by Gabrielle Union. Williams also had a small role (playing herself) in the 2001 movie &quot;On the Line&quot;. Blaque appears on Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes&#x27;s 2001 solo debut album, &quot;Supernova&quot;, on the track titled &quot;Head to the Sky&quot;, which was only released internationally. In 2005, two clips of Fears&#x27;s solo songs titled &quot;The One&quot; and &quot;NJ2&quot; were leaked on the internet.

<doc id="537100" wikidata="Q681408" url="?curid=537100" title="Seru Epenisa Cakobau">
<text>Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau (; occasionally spelled &quot;Cacobau&quot; or phonetically &quot;Thakombau&quot;) (c.1815 – 1 February 1883) was a Fijian chief, monarch, and warlord (&quot;Vunivalu&quot;) who united part of Fiji&#x27;s warring tribes under his leadership, establishing a united Fijian kingdom. He was born on Natauloa, Nairai Island in Lomaiviti but spent his youth on Vanuaso, Gau, Lomaiviti, later returning to Bau to re-establish his Father&#x27;s Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa reign. Ratu Epenisa Seru Visawaqa was given the name &quot;Cakobau&quot; meaning destroyer of Bau, in reference to his grandfathers&#x27; (Nailatikau) effort to first claim the tile from the people of Butoni and Lovoni, returned with most of his warriors from Vanuaso, Gau, Lomaiviti to coup the leadership in Bau then and later takeover his father&#x27;s title; known after his father as the 6th &quot;Vunivalu&quot; or Warlord of Bau.

==Background==
He was born to &quot;Ratu&quot; Tanoa Visawaqa on Nairai Island, Lomaiviti, and one of his nine wives, &quot;Adi&quot; Savusavu.

The &quot;Vunivalu&quot; and the &quot;Roko Tui Bau&quot; (sacred chieftain) had had many power struggles during the course of nearly a century. These struggles led to the death of Seru&#x27;s paternal uncle, the &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau, Naulivou Ramatenikutu and the installation of Tanoa as &quot;Vunivalu&quot;. However, after he killed the &quot;Roko Tui Bau&quot;, &quot;Ratu&quot; Raiwalui, near Vanua Balavu, amongst other murders and reprisals, Tanoa was exiled in 1832.

He married two sisters, Litia (Lydia) Samanunu and Salote (Charlotte) Qalirea Kaunilotuna (daughters of the &quot;Roko Tui Bau&quot;).

Mary Wallis provided a description of him after meeting with him on 7 December 1844: &quot;He is tall, rather good looking, appears fully aware of his consequence, and is not destitute of dignity. He wore an enormous quantity of hair on his head and several yards of native cloth around his body...&quot;
Seru was given the name &quot;Cikinovu&quot; (&quot;Centipede&quot;), &quot;because he moved silently and struck painfully&quot;. Later, he was called &quot;Cakobau&quot; (&quot;destroyer of Bau&quot;), because he had destroyed what was Bau; but Seru also built a new Bau, under the supremacy of the Vunivalu. After he converted to Christianity, he also took the additional name of Epenisa (Ebenezer).

==Rise to power==
On 8 December 1852, Cakobau succeeded as &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau.

Cakobau, a former cannibal, was converted to Christianity by the missionary James Calvert and renounced cannibalism in 1854.

Claiming that Bau had suzerainty over the remainder of Fiji, he asserted that he was the King of Fiji. However, Cakobau&#x27;s claim was not accepted by other chiefs, who regarded him, at best, as the first among equals. Cakobau consequently engaged in constant warfare for almost nineteen years to unify the islands under his authority.

The last, brief rebellion of chiefs against Cakobau&#x27;s rule culminated in the Battle of Kaba (a village in Bau Tikina, next to Bau Island). Cakobau crushed the rebellion with the aid of the King of Tonga. Having converted to Christianity, on the battlefield he pardoned all the captives; in accordance with pagan Fijian customs, the defeated men would have been ceremonially humiliated, killed and eaten.

On 8 May 1865, a Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Viti was established (comprising Bau, Bua, Cakaudrove, Lakeba, Macuata, Naduri), with Cakobau as Chairman of the General Assembly. Two years later, however, the confederacy split into the Kingdom of Bau and the Confederation of Lau (comprising Bua, Cakaudrove, Lau), with Cakobau assuming kingship of the former.

Supported by foreign settlers, he finally succeeded in creating a united Fijian kingdom in 1871, and established Levuka as his capital. He decided to set up a constitutional monarchy, and the first legislative assembly met in November of that year. Both the legislature and the Cabinet were dominated by foreigners. He gave his war club to Queen Victoria on 10 October 1874 when the Deed of Cession by which the sovereignty of Fiji passed to the British Crown was signed. In October 1932, King Cakobau’s war club was presented, on behalf of King George V, for ceremonial use as the Ceremonial mace of the Legislative Council of Fiji.

==Cession of power==

The United States government had recognised Cakobau&#x27;s claim to kingship over a united Fijian nation, long before his claims were accepted by his fellow chiefs. In the long term, however, this was not to count in his favour. The American government held him responsible for an arson attack against the Nukulau Island home of John Brown William, the American Consul, in 1849 (before Cakobau was even the Vunivalu, let alone King), and demanded $44,000 compensation. Unable to pay the debt caused by the Rewan Chiefs, and fearing an American invasion and annexation, Cakobau decided to cede the islands to the United Kingdom. He and his diplomatic party sailed to Sydney to celebrate the annexation, where they contracted measles. Their return triggered an epidemic.

Cakobau retained his position as Fiji&#x27;s second most senior chief the title of &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau, and formally ceded the highest and most precedent Chiefly title of Tui Viti or Paramount Chief of Fiji to the person of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. This title continued to be held by her descendants, until the de-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs on 14 March 2012, making Elizabeth II the last Paramount Chief. He lived quietly until his death on 1 February 1883.

==Legacy==

Several of Fiji&#x27;s leading figures were direct descendants of Cakobau. His great-grandson, &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir George Cakobau who descended from Cakobau&#x27;s third son, served as Fiji&#x27;s first native-born Governor-General from 1973 to 1983, while &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Kamisese Mara, modern Fiji&#x27;s first Prime Minister and second President descended from Cakobau&#x27;s second daughter, &quot;Adi&quot; Asenaca Kakua Vuikaba. &quot;Ratu&quot; Epeli Nailatikau, who became President of Fiji in 2009 and currently the speaker of Fiji&#x27;s House of Representatives, is a grandson of Cakobau&#x27;s granddaughter, &quot;Adi&quot; Litia Cakobau. &quot;Ratu&quot; Epeli is also a cousin of parliamentarian and former leader of opposition &quot;Ro&quot; Teimumu Kepa, who descends from &quot;Adi&quot; Teimumu Vuikaba, the younger sister of &quot;Adi&quot; Litia Cakobau. A number of other political figures are also descendants of Cakobau, including &quot;Roko&quot; Tupou Draunidalo, former President of the National Federation Party and a former Member of Parliament.

Musician Charlie Rogers is fired from a job at a teahouse after brawling with several college students in the parking lot. After a night in jail, Charlie hits the road on his Honda 305 Superhawk motorcycle. He spots Cathy Lean driving with her father Joe, and their employer, Maggie Morgan. When Charlie tries to become friendly with Cathy, Joe forces him off the road and the bike is wrecked after crashing into a wooden fence.

Maggie offers him a place to stay and a job with her struggling traveling carnival while the bike is being repaired. Charlie becomes a &quot;carnie&quot;, a roustabout. Maggie recognizes his musical talents and promotes him to feature attraction. His act soon draws large crowds. Charlie romances Cathy, which creates animosity with Joe. After the two men repeatedly clash and Charlie is accused of holding back a customer&#x27;s lost wallet that Joe was accused of stealing, Charlie leaves to star in the much better financed show of rival carnival producer Harry Carver.

Once again, he is a great success. However, when Charlie learns that Maggie is facing bankruptcy, he returns to her carnival. In the musical finale, he is happily reunited with Cathy. Charlie goes back to the carnival to help rescue the carnival. Joe takes another swung at Charlie and Charlie defends himself. Maggie witnesses the fight and asks Charlie to be honest once in his life and stop being a louse. Charlie said he came back to save the carnival and because he loves Cathy.

==Reception==
&quot;Roustabout&quot; reached #8 nationally at the box office in 1964 based on the &quot;Variety&quot; survey. The film finished as #28 on the year-end list of the top-grossing movies of 1964 and earned $3 million at the box office.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Howard Thompson complained about &quot;little in the way of dramatic substance&quot; and that the movie wasn&#x27;t &quot;nearly so trim a package&quot; as &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot; or &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, but noted that Elvis was &quot;perfectly cast&quot; and &quot;surprisingly convincing in his role.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; was lukewarm, faulting mainly a script &quot;loaded with clichés&quot;, but noted the film would likely be a box-office hit based upon its star names, songs, and &quot;Technicolor, Techniscope frame.&quot; John L. Scott of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a trite, cliche-ridden story that has been thrown together to showcase Elvis Presley and his vocalizing. It serves its purpose well, and probably will prove a box office bonanza for producer Hal Wallis.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Presley vehicles have sadly deteriorated since the days of &quot;Follow That Dream,&quot; and this amiable but uninspiring piece does nothing to halt the process, despite curiosity value provided by Barbara Stanwyck, back with Paramount for the first time in ten years.&quot;

Quentin Tarantino called &quot;Roustabout&quot; one of Presley&#x27;s most entertaining films and said that it had the best soundtrack of all of Presley&#x27;s color films.

&quot;Roustabout&quot; holds a 56% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on nine reviews.

==Awards and honors==
The film&#x27;s screenwriters, Anthony Lawrence and Allan Weiss, were nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. The film generated a best-selling soundtrack album that went #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The soundtrack album would be Presley&#x27;s final #1 soundtrack and last #1 album until 1969&#x27;s &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot;, which topped the charts in the U.K.

<doc id="537103" wikidata="Q852687" url="?curid=537103" title="List of states and union territories of India by population">
<text>India is a union consisting of 28 states and 8 union territories. As of 2024, with an estimated population of 1.484 billion, India is the world&#x27;s most populous country. India occupies 2.4% of the world&#x27;s area and is home to 17.5% of the world&#x27;s population. The Indo-Gangetic Plain has one of the world&#x27;s biggest stretches of fertile not-deep alluvium and are among the most densely populated areas of the world. The eastern and western coastal regions of Deccan Plateau are also densely populated regions of India. The Thar Desert in western Rajasthan is one of the most densely populated deserts in the world. The northern and north-eastern states along the Himalayas contain cold arid deserts with fertile valleys. These states have relatively low population density due to indomitable physical barriers.

==Census of India==
The first population census in British India was conducted in 1872. Since India&#x27;s independence in 1947, a census has been conducted every 10 years, the first occurring in 1951. The census in India is conducted by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner under the Ministry of Home Affairs, and is one of the largest administrative tasks conducted by a federal government.

The latest population figures are based on data from the 2011 census of India. During the decade of 2001–2011, India&#x27;s annual population growth rate has slowed down from 2.15 percent to 1.76 percent. Based on decennial census data, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu has the fastest growth rate of 55.1 percent, followed by Meghalaya (27.8 percent) and Arunachal Pradesh (25.9 percent). Nagaland recorded the lowest growth rate of -0.5 percent.

India has 641,000 inhabited villages and 72.2 percent of the total population reside in these rural areas. Of them 145,000 villages have population size of 500–999 persons; 130,000 villages have population size of 1000–1999 and 128,000 villages have population size of 200–499. There are 3,961 villages that have a population of 10,000 persons or more. India&#x27;s 27.8 percent urban population lives in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. In the decade of 1991–2001, migration to major cities caused rapid increase in urban population. On the basis of net migrants by last residence during the past decade, Maharashtra had most immigration with 2.3 million, followed by National Capital Territory of Delhi (1.7 million), Gujarat (0.68 million) and Haryana (0.67 million). Uttar Pradesh (−2.6 million) and Bihar (−1.7 million) topped the list for interstate emigration. The five states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh account for almost half (47.90 percent) of the total Indian population.

While the national average for the sex ratio shows an increase from 933 in 2001 to 940 in 2011, the 2011 census shows a sharp decline in the child sex ratio, the number of females per thousand males in a population between age group 0–6 years. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded an increase in India&#x27;s child sex ratio. The national child sex ratio has declined from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Telangana census was separated from Andhra Pradesh state census figures, after Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014.

== List ==
Data from Census 2011 as published by the Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, Government of Telangana, and then Planning Commission.

<text>Peter Henry Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith (born 5 January 1950) is a British barrister who served as Attorney General for England and Wales and Attorney General for Northern Ireland from 2001 and 2007. His resignation, announced on 22 June 2007, took effect on 27 June, the same day that Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped down. Goldsmith was the longest serving Labour attorney general. He is currently a partner and head of European litigation practice at US law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton and Vice Chairperson of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre.

==Biography==
Goldsmith was born in Liverpool, Lancashire (now Merseyside), and is of Jewish descent. He was educated at Quarry Bank School before reading law at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and University College London. He was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1972, practising from Fountain Court Chambers in London. He took silk in 1987 and became a deputy High Court judge in 1994 and he was elected the youngest ever chairman of the Bar of England and Wales in 1995. He was raised to the peerage as a Labour peer in 1999, as &quot;Baron Goldsmith, of Allerton in the County of Merseyside&quot;. He was appointed Her Majesty&#x27;s Attorney General in June 2001. One of his first acts was to discuss breaches of the injunction against publishing the whereabouts of the offenders in the murder of James Bulger. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 2002.

Goldsmith has also held a number of posts in international legal organisations, including Council Member of the International Bar Association (IBA) and of the Union Internationale des Avocats. From 1998 until his appointment as Attorney General he was co-chairman of the IBA&#x27;s Human Rights Institute. Between 1997 and 2000 he was Chairman of the Financial Reporting Review Panel, a non-departmental public body responsible for enforcing financial reporting standards. In 1997 he was elected to membership of the American Law Institute and made a member of the Paris Bar.

In 1996 he founded the Bar Pro Bono Unit (now Advocate ) of which he was chairman until 2000 and remains president. He was the Prime Minister&#x27;s Personal Representative to the Convention for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

In November 2006, he visited a number of pro bono legal and criminal justice charities in Kenya, including Philemon Ministries.

In 2006, Goldsmith gave a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, calling for the closure of the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. Goldsmith called it a &quot;symbol of injustice&quot;, and said that it did not respect the rights of liberty or freedom.

In 2007 he won a High Court injunction against the BBC, preventing reporting of aspects of the New Labour Cash-for-Honours scandal by successfully arguing a broadcast of confidential information would have harmed a police inquiry.

==Al-Yamamah arms deal controversy==

In 2007, Goldsmith was accused of attempting to cover up the BAE-Saudi corruption case by ordering the Serious Fraud Office to call off its ongoing investigation into the matter, arguing that it might &quot;compromise national security.&quot;

He later admitted that the MI6 had never possessed intelligence that Saudi Arabia planned to cut security links with Britain.

== Invasion of Iraq controversy ==
The nature of Goldsmith&#x27;s legal advice to the government over the legality of the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a significant political issue at the time.

The government turned down repeated calls to break with tradition and have the advice made public. Goldsmith&#x27;s original memo to the prime minister written on 30 January 2003 opined that UN Resolution 1441 did not sanction the use of force and that a further resolution would be required before military action. A subsequent memo written on 7 March 2003 was eventually leaked to the press, which led to its official publication on 28 April 2005. In the memo, Lord Goldsmith discussed whether the use of force in Iraq could legally be justified by Iraq&#x27;s &#x27;material breach&#x27;, as established in UN Security Council Resolution 1441, of its ceasefire obligations as imposed by Security Council Resolution 687 at the end of the First Gulf War. Goldsmith concluded that &quot;a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable in principle of reviving the authorisation [of the use of force] in Resolution 678 without a further resolution.&quot; However, Goldsmith did concede that &quot;a court might well conclude that operative paragraphs 4 and 12 do require a further Council decision to revive the authorisation.&quot; In this memo he also concluded &quot;the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity. In other words, we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation.&quot;

In his final advice to the government, written on 17 March 2003, Goldsmith stated that the use of force in Iraq was lawful. This advice stated Goldsmith&#x27;s preferred view in more unequivocal terms than his earlier memo, without reference to the doubts expressed therein. This has led to allegations that Goldsmith succumbed to political pressure to find legal justification for the use of force against Iraq. Shortly after the leak Goldsmith released a statement in response to such allegations, saying that the two documents were consistent, pointing to the difference in the nature of the two documents and to the firm assurances he claims to have had received between 7 and 17 March that Iraq was indeed in breach of its obligations under Security Council resolutions.

The controversy was heightened by the resignation of Elizabeth Wilmshurst, deputy legal adviser at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, on 20 March 2003. A full version of her letter of resignation became public in March 2005. In this, Wilmshurst stated that the reason for her resignation was that she did not agree with the official opinion that the use of force in Iraq was legal. She also accused Goldsmith of changing his view on the matter. In the course of her testimony to the Iraq Inquiry commission, Wilmshurst, even though she understood that &quot;Goldsmith was put into an impossible position&quot;, expressed her disapproval of the way Goldsmith set about in formulating his eventual opinion. She said she thought &quot;the process that was followed in this case was lamentable,&quot; adding that she believed &quot;there should have been a greater transparency within [the British] government&quot; about the &quot;evolving legal advice.&quot; On the efforts of the Attorney General to determine the nature of the alleged Iraqi breaches, she expressed her disapproval of Goldsmith relying, in part, for his legal opinion, &quot;on private conversations he had with British and US negotiators on what the French [negotiators] had said,&quot; while &quot;of course, he hadn&#x27;t asked the French themselves.&quot;

In November 2008, the former Lord Chief Justice and Senior Law Lord Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated that Goldsmith&#x27;s advice contained &quot;no hard evidence&quot; that Iraq had defied UN resolutions &quot;in a manner justifying resort to force&quot; and that the invasion was &quot;a serious violation of international law and of the rule of law.&quot;

Goldsmith gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 27 January 2010, in which he was asked to explain his position on the legality of the invasion of Iraq.

In July 2017, former Iraqi general Abdulwaheed al-Rabbat launched a private war crimes prosecution, in the High Court in London, asking for Goldsmith, Tony Blair and former foreign secretary Jack Straw to be prosecuted for &quot;the crime of aggression&quot; for their role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The High Court ruled that, although the crime of aggression was recognised in international law, it was not an offence under UK law, and, therefore, the prosecution could not proceed.

==Present position==

Goldsmith has been appointed head of European Litigation at the London office of US law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. He was the first retiring UK Attorney General ever to join a law firm. In August 2008, Goldsmith qualified as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales to become a full equity partner of the firm (and so share in the firm&#x27;s profits and acquire an ownership share in the firm). He was reported – by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper on 27 September 2007 – to be remunerated at the rate of £1 million a year in his new position. The same report said that he would have expected to earn more than that if he had resumed practice at the English Bar. His former chambers are Fountain Court.

Upon leaving office, former attorneys general usually return to practise at the Bar, often at the chambers which they left upon appointment as attorney. Unlike the position with retired lord chancellors, there is no prohibition on an attorney general returning to practise at the Bar.

As a former minister and holder of public office, Goldsmith had to accept a number of restrictions on his freedom to practise for two years after leaving office. The restrictions are imposed by the prime minister on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, a branch of the Cabinet Office.

Goldsmith&#x27;s restrictions prevented him, for 12 months after leaving office, from being personally involved in lobbying government Ministers or officials. For two years after leaving office, he was required to stand aside from dealing with any matter about which he had confidential or privileged information acquired while he was Attorney General.

In August 2008, Goldsmith was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Australian property trust, Westfield Group.

<text>The Komische Oper Berlin is a German opera company based in Berlin. The company produces operas, operettas and musicals.

The opera house is located on Behrenstraße, near Unter den Linden. Since 2004, the Komische Oper Berlin, along with the Berlin State Opera, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Ballet, and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design), has been a member of the Berlin Opera Foundation.

== History of the building ==
The theatre was built between 1891 and 1892 by architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer for a private society. It first opened on 24 September 1892 as &quot;Theater Unter den Linden&quot; with Adolf Ferron&#x27;s operetta &quot;Daphne&quot; and Gaul and Haßreiter&#x27;s ballet &quot;Die Welt in Bild und Tanz&quot;.

The theatre was primarily a vehicle for operetta, but was also used for various other events and balls. Around 800 people could be seated in the stalls, and the balconies and various en-suite dinner rooms housed about a further 1,700 seats. Its directors went bankrupt in 1896 and the theatre was forced to close its doors.

On 3 September 1898 the theatre was reopened as the Metropol-Theater (Berlin-Mitte) with Julius Freund&#x27;s revue &quot;Paradies der Frauen&quot;. It then grew to become one of Berlin&#x27;s most famous and successful variety theatres. During the 1920s and early 1930s, it was leased by the brothers Alfred and Fritz Rotter. Under their management, it saw the premieres of two operettas by Franz Lehár – &quot;Friederike (opera)&quot; in 1928 and Das Land des Lächelns in 1929, both starring Richard Tauber. However, due to a decline of variety and music hall entertainment the theatre was again closed in 1933.

In 1934 the theatre was nationalised and renamed &quot;Staatliches Operettentheater&quot;. It operated as part of the Nazi &quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; entertainment and leisure programmes. During World War II, the auditorium was damaged by Allied bombing on 7 May 1944. The façade, entrance hall, and auditorium ceiling murals were destroyed by bombs on 9 March 1945.

After the war, the theatre was in East Germany, being that the building was in the eastern part of Berlin. Following repair works and provisional rebuilding, the theatre reopened on 23 December 1947, as the &quot;Komische Oper&quot; with Johann Strauss&#x27;s operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;.

The 1950s saw various further alterations and extensions. The theatre was completely rebuilt in 1965/1966 by Architektenkollektiv Kunz Nierade, adding functional extensions and giving the theatre a completely new exterior. The theatre reopened again on 4 December 1966, with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. The auditorium underwent further restoration in 1986, and the stage technology was further modernised by 1989. Today the theatre seats 1,270. Starting in August 2023, renovations began on the theatre. Over an expected period of five seasons, the company is planning for its productions to occur at alternative venues, including the Schiller Theater and an unused airport hangar at Berlin Tempelhof Airport.

== The Komische Oper company ==
In 1947, Walter Felsenstein founded and led the resident opera company, the &quot;Komische Oper&quot;, until his death in 1975. Götz Friedrich was an assistant to Felsenstein at the company. Joachim Herz became general director after Felsenstein&#x27;s death and served until 1981. Subsequently, Harry Kupfer directed the company for 21 seasons, until 2002. The company specializes in German language productions of opera, operetta and musicals. In 2007 the company won, jointly with Oper Bremen, the &quot;Opera house of the year&quot; award by the German magazine &quot;Opernwelt&quot;. In 2015, it received the &quot;Opera Company of the Year&quot; award at the International Opera Awards. From 2002 to 2012, the company&#x27;s chief director and &quot;Intendant&quot; was Andreas Homoki.

In June 2008, the company announced the appointment of Barrie Kosky to succeed Homoki as its next &quot;Intendant&quot;, as of the 2012/2013 season. In October 2014, his contract with the company was extended through 2022. Since 2005, the company&#x27;s managing director has been Susanne Moser. In January 2019, the company announced multiple scheduled management changes effective with the 2022–2023 season:

* Kosky is to stand down as its &quot;Intendant&quot; at the close of the 2021–2022 season, and subsequently to continue his affiliation with the company as &quot;Hausregisseur&quot; (in-house director).
* Moser and the company&#x27;s current &quot;Operndirektor&quot;, Philip Bröking, are to become joint Intendants of the company effective with the 2022–2023 season.

From 1966 to 2004, the theatre was also home to a resident ballet company – first as the &quot;Tanztheater der Komischen Oper&quot;, and then from 1999 as &quot;BerlinBallett – Komische Oper&quot;. In 2004, due to budgetary problems, the separate ballet companies of Berlin&#x27;s three opera houses were merged into a single company called the Staatsballett Berlin.

Past General Music Directors (GMD) of the company have included Kurt Masur, Rolf Reuter, Yakov Kreizberg, Kirill Petrenko, Carl St.Clair, Patrick Lange. and Ainārs Rubiķis. In January 2022, the company announced the appointment of James Gaffigan as its next music director, effective with the 2023–2024 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.

<text>Crown Melbourne (also referred to as Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex) is an integrated resort consisting of a casino and hotel located on the south bank of the Yarra River, in Melbourne, Australia. Crown Melbourne is a subsidiary of Crown Resorts, and was the first casino of the now-international Crown brand.

Initially having opened in 1994 on the north bank of the Yarra River, Crown Melbourne relocated and re–opened on the south bank of the Yarra, in 1997. It remains one of the central features of the Southbank precinct of the Melbourne central business district. The entire complex has a space of 510,000 m2—the equivalent to two city blocks—making it the largest casino complex in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. The complex also hosts three hotels; the Crown Towers, Crown Promenade and Crown Metropol.

It was founded, owned and run by Lloyd Williams until taken over by Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Limited in 1999.

== Opening and statistics ==

=== Temporary location ===
Crown Melbourne opened on 30 June 1994 at the World Trade Centre on the northern bank of the Yarra River. This location was a temporary, and training, setup while construction of the proper complex occurred.

=== Permanent location ===
Crown&#x27;s permanent location opened on 8 May 1997 of the southern bank of the Yarra River. It was designed by a team of architects and interior designers working in collaboration, including: Bates Smart, Perrott Lyon Mathieson and Daryl Jackson (in association).

On opening night, Actress Rachel Griffiths infamously ran through the casino topless on its opening night to protest the project.

It is one of the central features of the Southbank area in the Melbourne central business district and the Crown Towers fronts onto the waterfront as part of Southbank Promenade. Children under the age of 18 are permitted into the entertainment and shopping section of complex, but not into the gaming area or areas serving alcohol. The entire complex has a space of 510,000 m2, making it the largest casino complex in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the largest in the world.

Crown Casino has a licence for 540 table games (100 poker tables) and 2,500 poker machines.

==Restaurants, bars and retail==

There are several nightclubs and restaurants as well as &quot;Kingpin&quot; (formerly Galactic Circus), an electronic games arcade, laser tag game, bowling alley, and many luxury brands.

===Restaurants===

*Conservatory
*Koko
*Rockpool Bar and Grill
*Nobu Melbourne
*The Atlantic
*Silks
*Bistro Guillaume
==Hotels ==

Crown has three hotel towers:

* Crown Towers: a skyscraper comprising a five-star luxury hotel located within the Crown Entertainment Complex. It houses 481 rooms and villas over 38 floors. Located on the banks of the Yarra River it overlooks the city centre, Kings Domain, Port Phillip and Docklands.
* Crown Metropol: reputedly Australia&#x27;s largest hotel by number of rooms. This five-star hotel houses 658 rooms across 28 floors.
* Crown Promenade: a 465-room, 4.5-star hotel on 23 floors. It is located on the block behind Crown Towers and is connected to the main complex by a pedestrian overpass. It also houses Australia&#x27;s only purpose built hotel conference facility the &#x27;Crown Conference Centre&#x27;.

A fourth hotel, One Queensbridge, had plans for its construction approved. However, these plans fell through due to a failure to acquire financing.

===Notable guests at Crown&#x27;s hotels===
Notable guests at the Crown Towers, Crown Metropol and Crown Promenade Hotels have included Celine Dion, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Nicole Kidman, Rachel Griffiths, One Direction, Keanu Reeves, Kerry Packer, Tiger Woods and Neil Murray and many other high-profile celebrities and politicians. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and several other tennis players often stay at the casino during the Australian Open.

==Attractions==

===The Palladium Ballroom===
The Palladium at Crown is a ballroom with a seating capacity of 1500. It has played host to some of Australia&#x27;s premier functions, including the annual Logie Awards, Brownlow Medal, Melbourne Victory Player of the Year Medal, Allan Border Medal, the Australian Formula One Grand Prix ball and the Melbourne Press Club Quill award for excellence in journalism.

===Water features===
Water features appear both inside and outside the Crown Casino complex.

===Gas brigades fire show===

Along the Yarra River, outside crown, there are eight towers, at night these towers shoot spheres of fire, almost 3 metres in diameter, in the air at choreographed intervals. The show occurs every hour with times of operating depending on the season of the year and do not operate in strong winds or when a total fire ban is declared.

== Controversies ==
=== Criminal activities ===
*In 2016, eighteen employees of Crown Casino were detained by Chinese police after having been accused of resorting to gambling crimes.
*In June 2022, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) stated Crown Melbourne aided in the processing of A$164 million in transactions and earned A$32 million in income from illicit payments. The illicit payments came from Chinese gamblers and the company aided in unlawfully transferring the money out of the country. Due to this the company had been fined A$80 million.
*In November 2022, Crown Melbourne was sanctioned with A$120 million in fines for breaches of responsible gambling legislation which had occurred for over a decade. Some of the breaches Crown was fined for included allowing its patrons to gamble for periods of over 24 hours without taking a break and the failure to stop patrons from using plastic picks to engage in auto-play on Poker Machines. The chair of the VGCCC, Fran Thorn, said that &quot;for a long time, Crown had promoted itself as having the world’s best approach to problem gambling. Nothing could be further from the truth&quot; and that the casino operator &quot;prioritised revenue maximisation over its obligations to protect patrons.&quot;

=== The Finkelstein Royal Commission ===

* The Royal Commission into the Casino Operator and Licence heavily criticised crown for a variety of illegal and unethical activities. The commission&#x27;s findings of Crown include money laundering, strong ties to organised criminal networks, and found other serious problems with Crown&#x27;s corporate governance among other things. Essentially, the Royal Commission made the recommendation that Crown be put under a two-year review period where they are able to keep their license to operate, but have to make major changes in order to facilitate a legal casino operation and responsible gambling. This includes the appointment of an inspector to monitor and ascertain whether money laundering, loan sharking, or illicit drug sales were taking place and exclude people when necessary.
* The Victorian State Government accepted the recommendations made by the commission and has introduced the Casino and Gambling Legislation Amendment Bill 2021 which appoints a Special Manager to oversee all operations and decision making of Crown, establishes a new regulator known as the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission which has new powers and imposes more obligations on Crown, and bans Junket operations among other things.

=== Thefts ===
*In 2002, Thomas Mangos, a 39-year-old man from Bundoora, stole $136,000 from crown casino&#x27;s Mahogany Room using a fake gun. Mangos&#x27; armed robbery occurred after he was &quot;seduced&quot; by the casino and lost $1 million gambling. He later turned himself into police, was charged, pleaded guilty, and was subsequently sentenced to a 5 years term of imprisonment with a 3-year non-parole period.
*In 2013, a man with access to the video feeds from Crown&#x27;s security cameras via an accomplice cheated the casino out of $33 million.

=== Other ===
*In September 2015, Rochelle Nolan the fiancée and de facto wife of entertainer/comedian Russell Gilbert, took her own life after a battle with depression and was found deceased in one of the rooms of the hotel.

<text>MARS is a block cipher that was IBM&#x27;s submission to the Advanced Encryption Standard process. MARS was selected as an AES finalist in August 1999, after the AES2 conference in March 1999, where it was voted as the fifth and last finalist algorithm.

The MARS design team included Don Coppersmith, who had been involved in the creation of the previous Data Encryption Standard (DES) twenty years earlier. The project was specifically designed to resist future advances in cryptography by adopting a layered, compartmentalized approach. 

IBM&#x27;s official report stated that MARS and Serpent were the only two finalists to implement any form of safety net with regard to would-be advances in cryptographic mathematics. The Twofish team made a similar statement about its cipher.

MARS has a 128-bit block size and a variable key size of between 128 and 448 bits (in 32-bit increments). Unlike most block ciphers, MARS has a heterogeneous structure: several rounds of a cryptographic core are &quot;jacketed&quot; by unkeyed mixing rounds, together with key whitening.

==Security analysis==
Subkeys with long runs of ones or zeroes may lead to efficient attacks on MARS. The two least significant bits of round keys used in multiplication are
always set to the value 1. Thus, there are always two inputs that are unchanged through the multiplication process regardless of the subkey, and two others which have fixed output regardless of the subkey.

A meet-in-the-middle attack published in 2004 by John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier can break 21 out of 32 rounds of MARS.

<doc id="537137" wikidata="Q1418002" url="?curid=537137" title="Finnish National Opera and Ballet">
<text>The Finnish National Opera and Ballet (; ) is a Finnish opera company and ballet company based in Helsinki. It is headquartered in the Opera House on the coast of the Töölönlahti bay in Töölö, which opened in 1993, and is state-owned through Senate Properties. The Opera House features two auditoriums, the main auditorium with 1,350, seats and a smaller studio auditorium with 300–500 seats.

==History==
Regular opera performances began in Finland in 1873 with the founding of the Finnish Opera by Kaarlo Bergbom. Prior to that, opera had been performed in Finland sporadically by touring companies, and on occasion by Finnish amateurs, the first such production being &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; in 1849. However, the Finnish Opera company soon plunged into a financial crisis and folded in 1879. During its six years of operation, Bergbom&#x27;s opera company had given 450 performances of a total of 26 operas, and the company had managed to demonstrate that opera can be sung in Finnish too. After the disbandment of the Finnish Opera, the opera audiences of Helsinki had to confine themselves to performances of visiting opera companies and occasional opera productions at the Finnish National Theatre.

The reincarnation of the Finnish opera institution took place about 30 years later. A group of notable social and cultural figures, led by the international star soprano Aino Ackté, founded the Domestic Opera in 1911. From the very beginning, the opera decided to engage both foreign and Finnish artists. A few years later the Domestic Opera was renamed the Finnish Opera in 1914. In 1956, the Finnish Opera was, in turn, taken over by the Foundation of the Finnish National Opera, and acquired its present name.

Between 1918 and 1993 the home of the opera was the Alexander Theater, which had been assigned to the company on a permanent basis. The home was inaugurated with an opening performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;. When the first dedicated opera house in Finland was finally completed and inaugurated in 1993, the old opera house was given back its original name, the Alexander Theater, after the Tsar Alexander II.

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of many of its planned productions, Finnish National Opera commissioned, created, and produced &quot;Covid fan tutte&quot;, a comic opera using music from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;, starring a Finnish cast and premiering in late August 2020 with social distancing restrictions. A filmed performance of the opera, with English and Finnish subtitles, is made available online worldwide through 30 March 2021.

==Personnel==
