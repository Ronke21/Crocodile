<text>Joel Albert McCrea (November 5, 1905 – October 20, 1990) was an American actor whose career spanned a wide variety of genres over almost five decades, including comedy, drama, romance, thrillers, adventures, and Westerns, for which he became best known.

He appeared in over one hundred films, starring in over eighty, among them Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s espionage thriller &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940), Preston Sturges&#x27; comedy classics &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; (1942), the romance film &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1932), the adventure classic &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (1932), Gregory La Cava&#x27;s bawdy comedy &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1933), George Stevens&#x27; six-time Academy Award nominated romantic comedy &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943), William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;These Three&quot;, &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (both 1936) and &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (1935), and a number of Westerns, including &quot;Wichita&quot; (1955) as Wyatt Earp and Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962), opposite Randolph Scott.

He starred in a total of three Best Picture Oscar nominees: &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940), and &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943).

With the exception of the British thriller &quot;Rough Shoot&quot; (1953) and film noir &quot;Hollywood Story&quot; (1951), McCrea appeared in Western films exclusively from 1946 until his retirement in 1976.

==Early life==
McCrea was born in South Pasadena, California, the son of Thomas McCrea, an executive with the L.A. Gas &amp; Electric Company, and Louise &quot;Lou&quot; Whipple. As a boy, he had a paper route delivering the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; to Cecil B. DeMille and other people in the film industry. He also had the opportunity to watch D. W. Griffith filming &quot;Intolerance&quot;, and was an extra in a serial starring Ruth Roland.

McCrea graduated from Hollywood High School and then Pomona College (class of 1928.) There he had acted on stage and took courses in drama and public speaking, while also appearing regularly at the Pasadena Playhouse. In 1928 he also met Wyatt Earp in Hollywood – later in 1955, McCrea would portray Earp in the film, &quot;Wichita.&quot; As a high school student McCrea worked as a stunt double and held horses for Hollywood cowboy stars William S. Hart and Tom Mix. McCrea had a love and understanding of horses from an early age, and later he was considered one of the best riders in Western films.

The strapping 6&#x27;2½&quot; McCrea variously worked as an extra, stunt man, and bit player from 1927 to 1928, when he signed a contract with MGM. He was cast in a major role in &quot;The Jazz Age&quot; (1929), and got his first leading role that year in &quot;The Silver Horde&quot;. He moved to RKO in 1930, where he established himself as a handsome and versatile leading man capable of starring in both dramas and comedies.

==Career==

In the 1930s, McCrea starred in the pre-code film, &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1932), directed by King Vidor, co-starring with Dolores del Río. In RKO&#x27;s &quot;The Sport Parade&quot; (1932), McCrea and William Gargan are friends on the Dartmouth football team, who are shown snapping towels at each other in the locker room, while other players are taking a shower. In 1932 he starred with Fay Wray in &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; – which used some of the same jungle sets built for &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) as well as cast members Wray and Robert Armstrong, and was filmed at night while &quot;King Kong&quot; was filmed during the day. He was originally intended for the character Jack Driscoll in &quot;King Kong&quot;, but he turned down the role which subsequently went to Bruce Cabot.
In 1934 he made his first appearances with two leading ladies he would be paired with often, Miriam Hopkins in &quot;The Richest Girl in the World&quot;, the first of their five films together, and Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;Gambling Lady&quot;, the first of their six pairings.

Later in the decade he was the first actor to play &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, in the film &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot; (1937), and starred in two large-scale Westerns, &quot;Wells Fargo&quot; (1937) with his wife Frances Dee, and Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Union Pacific&quot; (1939).

McCrea reached the peak of his early career in the early 1940s, in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thriller &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940), a romantic comedy, &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943), directed by George Stevens, and two comedies by Preston Sturges: &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; (1942). While shooting &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, it was an on-set joke that tall McCrea&#x27;s leading lady, Veronica Lake, had to stand on a box for some shots, as she was reportedly 16 inches shorter than McCrea, and it was otherwise impossible to get both of their heads in the same shot.

McCrea turned down playing in a number of films; he was offered the lead role in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946) but he refused, saying &quot;This character is too much of a gigolo. I don&#x27;t like his moral standards.&quot; Among other movies he declined were &quot;Spitfire&quot; (1934), &quot;The Impatient Years&quot; (1944), &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Story of Will Rogers (&quot;1952). During World War II, McCrea refused to portray military heroes, with the explanation, &quot;Since I was too old to be called, I was too old for that kind of a show&quot;. He was also notoriously modest about his acting abilities, and would say that he didn&#x27;t feel good enough to play certain parts. He also preferred playing roles that he could see himself in. Despite his own opinion of his acting, Katharine Hepburn reportedly felt that he was one of the best actors with whom she had worked. She believed McCrea should have been ranked alongside Spencer Tracy or Humphrey Bogart.

McCrea also starred in two William A. Wellman Westerns, &quot;The Great Man&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1942), again with Stanwyck, and &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; (1944), with character actor Edgar Buchanan and a young Maureen O&#x27;Hara. After the success of the film &quot;The Virginian&quot; in 1946, McCrea made Westerns exclusively for the rest of his career, with two exceptions: an uncredited role in the 1951 film noir &quot;Hollywood Story&quot; and the British-made &quot;Rough Shoot&quot; (1953).

By that time the multi-millionaire McCrea had long been working his own ranch in Ventura County outside of L.A.. Specializing in Westerns was not merely a return to what he had done earlier in his career, but a genre he immensely enjoyed. As he described it (in a 1978 interview): I liked doing comedies, but as I got older I was better suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes unattractive for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations... Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western. The minute I got a horse and a hat and a pair of boots on, I felt easier. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was an actor anymore. I felt like I was the guy out there doing it.

On November 19, 1950, McCrea appeared on &quot;Television Theatre&quot; in an adaptation of &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;. In the early 1950s, McCrea starred as Jace Pearson on the radio series Western, &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot;. In 1955 he was Wyatt Earp in &quot;Wichita&quot; directed by Jacques Tourneur. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded the film with &quot;Best Picture – Outdoor Drama&quot; that year.

In 1959, McCrea and his son Jody starred in the brief NBC-TV series &quot;Wichita Town&quot;. Earlier he had turned down the lead in &quot;Rawhide&quot;, feeling it would make too heavy a workload. A few years later, McCrea united with fellow veteran of Westerns Randolph Scott in &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962), directed by Sam Peckinpah, after which he did not make another feature film until &quot;The Young Rounders&quot; (1966). Four more years were to pass before his next film, but 1970 saw the release of two: &quot;Cry Blood, Apache&quot;, again with his son Jody, and &quot;Sioux Nation&quot;. He made his final film appearance in 1976, in &quot;Mustang Country&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1968, McCrea received a career achievement award from the L.A. Film Critics Association, and the following year he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, McCrea has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6901 Hollywood Blvd. and another star at 6241 Hollywood Blvd. for his contribution to radio.

He was also a winner of the Golden Boot Award in 1987, the Golden Laurel Award in 1951, a Photoplay Award in 1939 for his performance in &quot;Union Pacific&quot;, the Silver Medallion Award in 1982, and the Trustees Award in 1976 for the film, &quot;Mustang Country&quot;.

==Personal life==
McCrea married actress Frances Dee in Rye, New York, on October 20, 1933, after they met while filming &quot;The Silver Cord&quot;. Coincidentally, Dee was born only a few blocks away from McCrea&#x27;s home, but she moved to Chicago during her childhood. They had three sons, Jody, Peter and David. They were married until McCrea&#x27;s death on their 57th wedding anniversary.

McCrea – who was an outdoorsman who had once listed his occupation as &quot;rancher&quot; and his hobby as &quot;acting&quot; – had begun buying property as early as 1933, when he purchased his first in a then unincorporated area of eastern Ventura County, California, which later became Thousand Oaks. This was the beginning of what evolved into a spread where McCrea and his wife lived, raised their sons, and rode their horses. At one point, McCrea&#x27;s ranch produced 200,000 pounds of beef every year. He was noted for being a hard worker on his ranch; he was very active in the management, including riding, roping and branding.

By the end of the 1940s, McCrea was a multi-millionaire, as much from his real-estate dealings as from his movie stardom. It is said that McCrea once joked that he &quot;only acted so he could afford to ranch.&quot; In the early 1960s, he sold of land to an oil company on the condition that they would not drill within sight of his home. McCrea&#x27;s perspicacity may have stemmed from his friendship in the 1930s with fellow personality and sometime actor Will Rogers. McCrea recounted that &quot;the Oklahoma Sage&quot; gave him a profound piece of advice: &quot;Save half of what you make, and live on just the other half.&quot;

McCrea supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election, Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election, and Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election.

In a story originally published in 1954, McCrea said he was a man of faith, who relied on the guidance of God in his personal life and career, saying that through the years he followed the principle of &quot;asking my way of Him.&quot; At the end of the article, McCrea added, &quot;I don&#x27;t claim I haven&#x27;t made mistakes. I have. But most of my mistakes were due to trusting &#x27;luck&#x27; or my own judgment instead of His.&quot;

McCrea made his final public appearance on October 3, 1990, at a fundraiser for Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson in Beverly Hills. He died less than three weeks later on October 20, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, from pneumonia at the age of 84.

After his death his family ultimately donated of McCrea&#x27;s former ranch to the newly formed Conejo Valley YMCA for the city of Thousand Oaks. They also donated to the Conejo Open Space Conservancy Agency (COSCA), which designated it the Joel McCrea Wildlife Preserve; and to the Boys and Girls Club of Camarillo.

He studied law in his hometown and then worked for a bank in Hamburg until the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the German Army.

==War service==
In 1943, having recovered from a severe wound he had suffered on the Eastern Front, Haeften became adjutant to Oberst Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, one of the leading figures in the German Resistance.

On 20 July 1944, Haeften accompanied Stauffenberg to the military high command of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; near Rastenburg, East Prussia (now Kętrzyn, in Poland), where Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb in a conference room at Hitler&#x27;s Wolfsschanze (Wolf&#x27;s Lair) headquarters. After the detonation, Stauffenberg and Haeften rushed to Berlin and, not knowing that Hitler had survived the explosion, attempted to launch the long-planned &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, which would swiftly fail.
On the same day, Haeften, along with Stauffenberg and fellow conspirators General Friedrich Olbricht and &quot;Oberst&quot; Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, was arrested after a summary court martial and sentenced to death by General Friedrich Fromm, who was himself later arrested and executed by the Nazi regime for his tacit complicity. All four plotters were shot after midnight by a ten-man firing squad from the Grossdeutschland Guards Battalion in the courtyard of the War Ministry, the Bendlerblock.

When Stauffenberg was about to be shot, in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance, Haeften placed himself in the path of the bullets meant for Stauffenberg.

Haeften&#x27;s brother, Hans, who had also been involved in the anti-Hitler plot, was executed on 15 August at Plötzensee Prison.
== Awards and decorations ==
* Iron Cross of 1939, 1st and 2nd class
* Eastern Front Medal
* Wound Badge in Black

==Fictional portrayals==
In the Eastern Bloc co-production &quot;Liberation: Direction of the Main Blow&quot; (1971), Haeften was depicted by the East German actor Hans-Edgar Stecher. In the German production &quot;Stauffenberg&quot; (2004), his part was played by the actor Hardy Krüger, Jr., and in the film &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008) he was portrayed by the British actor Jamie Parker.

In the 2000 alternate history novel &quot;Fox on the Rhine&quot;, the bomb delivered by Haeften and Stauffenberg succeeds in killing Hitler, but Heinrich Himmler avoids their attempts to arrest him and seizes control of the Third Reich (although his reign lasts for less than a year). While Beck, Olbricht, and many others ultimately flee, Haeften refuses to abandon Stauffenberg. When the SS arrive to arrest his superior, he opens fire at them with a pistol and attempts to shield Stauffenberg with his body before both men are gunned down. The sequel novel, &quot;Fox at the Front&quot;, mentions that his brother Hans-Bernd managed to escape to neutral territory and, along with other surviving plotters, has formed a government-in-exile.

<doc id="537262" wikidata="Q466066" url="?curid=537262" title="BMW 3 Series">
<text>The BMW 3 Series is a line of compact executive cars manufactured by the German automaker BMW since May 1975. It is the successor to the 02 Series and has been produced in seven generations.

The first generation of the 3 Series was only available as a 2-door saloon; the model range expanded to include a 4-door saloon, 2-door convertible, 2-door coupé, 5-door estate, 5-door liftback (&quot;Gran Turismo&quot;) and 3-door hatchback body styles. Since 2013, the coupé and convertible models have been marketed as the 4 Series, styles no longer included in the 3 Series.

The 3 Series is BMW&#x27;s best-selling model, accounting for around 30% of the BMW brand&#x27;s annual total car sales, and has won numerous awards throughout its history. The M version of the 3 series, M3, debuted with the E30 M3 in 1986.


== First generation (E21; 1975) ==

The E21 replaced the 02 Series and was initially available as a 2-door sedan (also described as coupé).

At launch, all models used carburetted 4-cylinder engines; however, fuel-injected models were introduced in late 1975 and 6-cylinder engines were added in 1977. A cabriolet body style – manufactured by Baur – was available from 1978 to 1981.
== Second generation (E30; 1982) ==

On introduction in 1982, the E30 was produced solely in the 2-door sedan body style. Four-door sedan models were introduced in 1983, convertibles were introduced in 1985 and estate (&quot;Touring&quot;) models were introduced in 1987.

The E30 was the first 3 Series to be available in wagon and 4-door sedan body styles. It was also the first 3 Series to offer a diesel engine, and all-wheel drive was introduced to the 3 Series range with the 325iX model. The BMW Z1 roadster was based on the E30 platform.

The first BMW M3 was built on the E30 platform. The E30 M3 is powered by the high-revving S14 four-cylinder petrol engine, which produced in its final European-only iteration.
== Third generation (E36; 1990) ==

The E36 was sold in the following body styles: sedan, coupé, convertible, wagon (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;), and hatchback (marketed as &quot;3 Series Compact&quot;). The Compact model, which was smaller than the traditional 4-door sedan version, was powered by the BMW&#x27;s four-cylinder engines developed during the 1990s.

The E36 was the second 3 Series to be offered in a hatchback body style. It was also the first 3 Series to be available with a 6-speed manual transmission (in the 1996 M3), a 5-speed automatic transmission, and a four-cylinder diesel engine. The multi-link rear suspension was also a significant upgrade compared with previous generations of the 3 Series.

The M3 model is powered by the S50 and S52 straight-six engines. It was sold in coupé, sedan and convertible body styles.

The BMW Z3 roadster and coupe models were based on the E36 platform. 
== Fourth generation (E46; 1997)==

The E46 was sold in the following body styles: sedan, coupé, convertible, wagon (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;), and hatchback (marketed as &quot;3 Series Compact&quot;).

The E46 generation introduced various electronic features to the 3 Series, including satellite navigation, electronic brake-force display, ASC/DSC, rain-sensing wipers, LED tail-lights, and Xenon headlights. All-wheel drive, last available in the E30 3 Series, was reintroduced for the E46. It was available for the 325xi and 330xi sedan/wagon models. The E46 generation came with the M52TU/M54 engines with dual Vanos (variable valve timing) and came with a GM 5 speed Automatic (5L40E), ZF 5 speed Manual (S5-31), Getrag 5 speed Manual (S5D-250G), ZF 6 speed Manual (GS6-37BZ/DZ), and ZF 6-speed Automatic Manual (SMG) (GS6S37BZ).

The M3 version of the E46 was powered by the S54 straight-six engine and was available in coupé and convertible body styles (other than that, it was powered with the M52 or M54 in non-M3 cars). The transmissions available were a 6-speed manual or the 6-speed &quot;SMG-II&quot; sequential manual gearbox.
== Fifth generation (E90/E91/E92/E93; 2004) ==

The fifth generation 3 Series was produced in the sedan, wagon (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;), coupé and cabriolet body styles. Due to the separate model codes for each body style, the term &quot;E9X&quot; is sometimes used to describe this generation of the 3 Series.

In 2006, the 335i became the first 3 Series model to be sold with a turbocharged gasoline engine. The E90 also saw the introduction of run-flat tires to the 3 Series range. Consequently, cars with run flats are not equipped with spare tires.

The E90/E92/E93 M3 was powered by the BMW S65 V8 engine. It was released in 2007 and was produced in sedan, coupe, and cabriolet body styles.

Production of the fifth-generation BMW 3 Series ended in 2012.
== Sixth generation (F30/F31/F34/F35; 2011) ==

The F30/F31/F35 has been produced in the sedan, coupé, convertible, station wagon and 5-door hatchback (&quot;Gran Turismo&quot;) body styles. A long-wheelbase sedan is also available in China.

For the F30/F31/F34 series, the coupe and convertible models were produced from the 2013 year until 2014 when they were split from the 3 Series, redesigned, and sold as the BMW 4 Series. A new body style was introduced into the 3 Series range: the 3 Series Gran Turismo, a long-wheelbase hatchback.

In 2016, a plug-in hybrid drivetrain was first used in the 3 Series, in the 330e model. Also in 2016, a 3-cylinder engine was used for the first time in a 3 Series.

The M3 version (designated F80, the first time an M3 has used a separate model designation) was released in 2014 and is powered by the S55 twin-turbo straight-6 engine.

Production ended in 2019 with the end of F31 Touring production in June.
== Seventh generation (G20/G21/G28; 2018) ==

The BMW 3 Series (G20) was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show on 2 October 2018. The official images of the vehicle were revealed a day prior to its unveiling. The seventh generation of the 3 Series is also offered as a station wagon. The more powerful M3 and M3 Competition variants were delivered globally starting in 2021. The G20 is the first 3 Series generation to bring an M3 Touring to market. Since 2022, it gained a battery electric version exclusive for the Chinese market as the i3, sharing its powertrain with the globally marketed i4. A facelift was revealed in May 2022, and launched in select markets in November 2022, for the 2023 model year.

== M versions ==


The M3 is the most performance oriented version of the 3 Series. It is designed and developed by BMW&#x27;s in-house motorsport division, BMW M.

M3 models have been derived from the E30, E36, E46, E90/E92/E93, and F30 (designated F80) 3 series and have been marketed with coupé, sedan and convertible body styles. Upgrades over the &quot;standard&quot; 3 Series automobiles include more powerful and responsive engines, improved handling/suspension/braking systems, aerodynamic body enhancements, lightweight components, and interior/exterior accents with the tri-color &quot;M&quot; (Motorsport) emblem.

The last M3 coupé was produced in Germany on 5 July 2013, replaced by the F82/F83 M4 coupé and convertible starting with the 2015 model year, but the M3 name remains in use for the sedan version. The new generation M3 was reintroduced in 2021, codenamed G80 from the 7th generation 3 Series (G20). The M3 represented above (The F80) was powered by a BMW S55 engine producing at 7,600 rpm.

In June 2022, BMW revealed the first BMW M3 Touring, codenamed G81. Based on the seventh generation 3 Series, it marks the first time a BMW M Touring model reached the market. The touring version of the M3 contains the same engine and interior setup as the M3 sedan, but extends the roof line to become a wagon.

== Awards and recognition ==
The 3 Series has been on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual 10 Best list 22 times, from 1992 through 2014, making it the longest-running entry in the list. In their December 2009 issue, &quot;Grassroots Motorsports&quot; magazine named the BMW 3 Series as the second-most important performance car built during the previous 25 years. In January 2021, the BMW 330e M Sport (M Sport Pro Package) was named Executive Car of the Year by &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine. &quot;What Car?&quot; awarded the 3 Series five stars out of five in its review of the car.

The plug-in hybrid version of the car was the UK&#x27;s best-selling plug-in hybrid car of 2021 having achieved 10,979 new registrations throughout the year, beating the Mercedes A-Class by over 4,000 registrations.

<text>The Isle of Man Football League is the senior football league on the Isle of Man and is run by the Isle of Man Football Association. Although the league is affiliated with The Football Association, it does not form a part of the English football league system.

==History==
The league&#x27;s representative XI has won the FA Inter-League Cup on two occasions. In 2006 they beat the Cambridgeshire County League XI and qualified for the 2007 UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup, being eliminated in the group stage in Czech Republic. They won the Inter-League Cup again in 2013, but again were eliminated in the group stage of the Regions Cup, this time in Slovakia.

==Competition format==

=== Competition ===
There are 26 clubs in the Isle of Man Football League which are grouped into two divisions: Premier League and Division Two. Each division has 13 clubs and in any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 24 games played each season. Clubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw and none for a defeat. Clubs are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored.

=== Promotion and relegation ===
A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and Division Two. At the end of each season the two lowest placed clubs in the Premier League are relegated to Division two, and the top two placed clubs from Division Two are promoted to the Premier League. Each club has a second team in either Combination Division One or Combination Division Two. Promotion and relegation within the combination league is decided by the movement of each club&#x27;s first team.

<doc id="537264" wikidata="Q3489476" url="?curid=537264" title="Fractional freezing">
<text>Fractional freezing is a process used in process engineering and chemistry to separate substances with different melting points. It can be done by partial melting of a solid, for example in zone refining of silicon or metals, or by partial crystallization of a liquid, as in freeze distillation, also called normal freezing or progressive freezing. The initial sample is thus fractionated (separated into fractions).

Partial crystallization can also be achieved by adding a dilute solvent to the mixture, and cooling and concentrating the mixture by evaporating the solvent, a process called solution crystallization. Fractional freezing is generally used to produce ultra-pure solids, or to concentrate heat-sensitive liquids.

==Freeze distillation==

Freeze distillation is actually a condensation, not distillation per se. It removes frozen solid, separating a dissolved material from the liquid left behind. This is analogous to true distillation, where the evaporated and re-condensed fraction is enriched.

Ethanol and liquid water are completely miscible, but ethanol is practically insoluble in water ice. That means almost pure water ice can be precipitated from a lean ethanol-water mixture by cooling it sufficiently. The precipitation of water ice from the mixture enriches ethanol in the remaining liquid phase. The two phases can then be separated by filtration or decanting. The temperature at which water ice starts to precipitate depends on the ethanol concentration. Consequently, at a given temperature and ethanol concentration, the freezing process will reach an equilibrium at a specific ratio of water ice and enriched ethanol solution with a specific ethanol concentration. The temperatures and mixing ratios of these phase equilibria can be read from the phase diagram of ethanol and water. The maximum enrichment of ethanol in the liquid phase is reached at the eutectic point of ethanol and water, approximately 92.4 weight-% ethanol at -123 °C.

The best-known freeze-distilled beverages are applejack and ice beer. Ice wine is the result of a similar process, but in this case, the freezing happens &quot;before&quot; the fermentation, and thus it is sugar, not alcohol, that gets concentrated.

==Purification of solids==
When a pure solid is desired, two possible situations can occur. If the contaminant is soluble in the desired solid, a multiple stage fractional freezing is required, analogous to multistage distillation. If, however, a eutectic system forms (analogous to an azeotrope in distillation), a very pure solid can be recovered, as long as the liquid is not at its eutectic composition (in which case a mixed solid forms, which can be hard to separate) or above its eutectic composition (in which case the undesired solid forms).

==Concentration of liquids==
When the requirement is to concentrate a liquid phase, fractional freezing can be useful due to its simplicity. Fractional freezing is also used in the production of fruit juice concentrates and other heat-sensitive liquids, as it does not involve heating the liquid (as happens during evaporation).

===Desalination===
Fractional freezing can be used to desalinate sea water. In a process that naturally occurs with sea ice, frozen salt water, when partially melted, leaves behind ice that is of a much lower salt content. Because sodium chloride lowers the melting point of water, the salt in sea water tends to be forced out of pure water while freezing, called brine rejection. Large lakes of higher salinity water, called polynyas, form in the middle of floes, and the water eventually sinks to the bottom. Likewise, the frozen water with the highest concentration of salt melts first. Either method decreases the salinity of the remaining frozen water, and after multiple runs the results can be drinkable.

===Alcoholic beverages===
Fractional freezing can be used as a simple method to increase the alcohol concentration in fermented alcoholic beverages, a process sometimes called freeze distillation. Examples are applejack, made from hard cider, and ice beer. In practice, while not able to produce an alcohol concentration comparable to distillation, this technique can achieve some concentration with far less effort than any practical distillation apparatus would require. The danger of fractional freezing of alcoholic beverages is that it does not remove impurities, unlike (heat) distillation. Thus, fractional freezing may increase the ratio of impurities to the total volume of the beverage (though not necessarily the ratio of impurities to the amount of ethanol). This concentration may cause side effects to the drinker, leading to intense hangovers and a condition known as &quot;apple palsy&quot; (although this term has also simply been used to refer to intoxication, especially from applejack.)
===Alternative fuels===
Fractional freezing is commonly used as a simple method to reduce the gel point of biodiesel and other alternative diesel fuels, whereby esters of higher gel point are removed from esters of lower gel point through cold filtering, or other methods to reduce the subsequent alternative fuel gel point of the fuel blend. This process employs fuel stratification whereby components in the fuel blend develop a higher specific gravity as they approach their respective gel points and thus sink to the bottom of the container, where they can be removed.

<doc id="537269" wikidata="Q134274" url="?curid=537269" title="Lactococcus">
<text>Lactococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria that were formerly included in the genus &quot;Streptococcus&quot; Group N1. They are known as homofermenters meaning that they produce a single product, lactic acid in this case, as the major or only product of glucose fermentation. Their homofermentative character can be altered by adjusting environmental conditions such as pH, glucose concentration, and nutrient limitation. They are gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-motile cocci that are found singly, in pairs, or in chains. The genus contains strains known to grow at or below 7˚C.

Twelve species of &quot;Lactococcus&quot; are currently recognized. They are:
*&quot;Lactococcus allomyrinae&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus carnosus&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus chungangensis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus cremoris&quot;
**&quot;L. cremoris&quot; subsp. &quot;cremoris&quot;
**&quot;L. cremoris&quot; subsp. &quot;tructae&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus formosensis&quot;
**&quot;L. formosensis&quot; subsp. &quot;bovis&quot;
**&quot;L. formosensis&quot; subsp. &quot;formosensis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus fujiensis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus garvieae&quot;
**&quot;L. garvieae&quot; subsp. &quot;garvieae&quot;
**&quot;L. garvieae&quot; subsp. &quot;bovis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus hircilactis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus hodotermopsidis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus insecticola&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus kimchii&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot;
**&quot;L. lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;hordniae&quot;
**&quot;L. lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;lactis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus laudensis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus nasutitermitis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus paracarnosus&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus petauri&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus piscium&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus plantarum&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus protaetiae&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus raffinolactis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus reticulitermitis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus taiwanensis&quot;
*&quot;Lactococcus termiticola&quot;

These organisms are commonly used in the dairy industry in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as cheeses. They can be used in single-strain starter cultures, or in mixed-strain cultures with other lactic acid bacteria such as &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. Special interest is placed on the study of &quot;L. lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;lactis&quot; and &quot;L. lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;cremoris&quot;, as they are the strains used as starter cultures in industrial dairy fermentations. Their main purpose in dairy production is the rapid acidification of milk; this causes a drop in the pH of the fermented product, which prevents the growth of spoilage bacteria. The bacteria also play a role in the flavor of the final product.
Lactococci are currently being used in the biotechnology industry. They are easily grown at industrial scale on whey-based media. As food-grade bacteria, they are used in the production of foreign proteins that are applied to the food industry.

==Diseases==
Lactococcosis refers to a group of disorders caused by the bacterium L. garvieae. Most &quot;Lacto&quot; species dwell on the bodies of humans and animals, and while they do not cause serious problems in higher animals, they do cause chronic illnesses in lower animals, particularly fish.

<text>ANIM is a file format, used to store digital movies and computer generated animations (hence the ANIM name), and is a variation of the ILBM format, which is a subformat of Interchange File Format.

==Main Features==

===Anim FileTypes===

Known filetypes for Anim into AmigaOS are: Anim1, Anim2, Anim3, Anim5 and Anim7. Anim1 to Anim3 did not support audio. Anim 5 and Anim7 should be able to contain Audio Data, being a complete movie animation file format. 

===Additions to IFF Standard===

In addition to the normal ILBM chunks, ANIM filetype also defines:

* ANHD (ANimation HeaDer)
* DLTA - stores changes between frames, with various compression methods supported to make use of the redundancy between frames.

Compression modes:
* ANIM-0 ILBM BODY (no delta compression)
* ANIM-1 ILBM XOR
* ANIM-2 Long Delta mode
* ANIM-3 Short Delta mode
* ANIM-4 General Delta mode
* ANIM-5 Byte Vertical Delta mode (most common)
* ANIM-6 Stereo Byte Delta mode (stereoscopic frames)
* ANIM-7 Anim-5 compression using LONG/WORD data
* ANIM-8 Anim-5 compression using LONG/WORD data
* ANIM-J Eric Grahams compression format (Sculpt 3D / Sculpt 4D)

It is possible to have several compression modes inside a file.

==History==

The ANIM IFF format was developed in 1988 at Sparta Inc., a firm based in California, originally for the production of animated video sequences on the Amiga computer, and was used for the first time in Aegis Development&#x27;s &quot;Videoscape&quot; and &quot;Video Titler&quot; programs for the Amiga line of computers. Being very efficient and an official subset of existing Amiga ILBM/IFF standard file format, it became the de facto standard for animation files on the Amiga.

The file format must have these characteristics:

*Be able to store, and playback, sequences of frames and to minimize both the storage space on disk (through compression) and playback time (through efficient de-compression algorithms).
*Maintain maximum compatibility with existing IFF formats and to be able to display the initial frame as a normal still IFF picture.

Several compression schemes have been introduced in the ANIM format. Most of these are strictly of historical interest, as the only one currently used is the vertical run length encoded byte encoding developed by Atari software programmer Jim Kent.

Amiga Anim7 format was created in 1992 by programmer Wolfgang Hofer.

A video file format originally created for the Commodore CDTV, and later adapted for the Amiga CD32, was called CDXL and was similar to the ANIM file format.

The ANIM format is supported by at least one current online image editor.

==Technical Overview==

A minimum Anim file consists of three ILBM interleaved bitmap images. The first bitmap is a full image, necessary for the creation of the &quot;next&quot; frame whilst the other two are &quot;delta&quot; images, calculated as differences from the first one.

The initial frame is a normal run-length-encoded, IFF picture, and this allows a preview of the contents of the file. Subsequent frames are then described by listing only their differences from a previous frame.

While the first frame is displayed, the subsequent frames are loaded into a buffer in graphics memory. The Amiga switches between the screens almost instantaneously while loading further frames using the blitter. Utilising its DMA capabilities, the graphics chipset could access memory without interrupting the CPU. This technique is called double buffering.

To better understand this, suppose one has two screens, called A and B, with the ability to instantly switch the display from one to the other. The initial frame is loaded in to screen A and B. Screen A is displayed. The differences between frame 1 and frame 2 are calculated and altered in screen B, which is then displayed. Then the differences from this and frame 3 are used to alter screen A, which is then displayed, and so on. Note that frame 2 is stored as differences from frame 1, but all other frames are stored as differences from two frames back.

ANIM is an IFF FORM and its chunk structure is as follows:
FORM ANIM
*FORM ILBM (first frame)
**BMHD (normal type IFF data)
**ANHD (optional animation header chunk for timing of 1st frame)
**CMAP (Colormap)
**BODY
*FORM ILBM (frame 2)
**ANHD (animation header chunk)
**DLTA (delta mode data)
*FORM ILBM (frame 3)
**ANHD
**DLTA

(And so on...)

The initial FORM ILBM can contain all the normal ILBM chunks, such as CRNG, etc. The BODY will normally be a standard run-length-encoded data chunk (but also any other legal compression mode as indicated by the BMHD). If desired, an ANHD chunk can appear here to provide timing data for the first frame. If it is here, the operation field should be =0.

The subsequent FORMs ILBM contain an ANHD, instead of a BMHD, which duplicates some of BMHD and has additional parameters pertaining to the animation frame. The DLTA chunk contains the data for the delta compression modes. If the older XOR compression mode is used, then a BODY chunk will be placed here. In addition, other chunks may be placed in each of these as deemed necessary (and as code is placed in player programs to utilize them). For example, the CMAP chunks to alter the color palette.

A basic assumption in ANIMs is that the size of the bitmap, and the display mode (e.g. HAM) will not change through the animation.

The DLTA chunks are not interleaved bitmap representations, thus the use of the ILBM form is inappropriate for these frames. However, this inconsistency was not noted until there were a number of commercial products either released or close to release which generated/played this format.

===Compression methods used in Anim format===

Anim format allow five methods of compression: XOR mode, Long Delta mode, Short Delta mode, General Delta mode and Byte Vertical Compression.

===Playing ANIM files===

Playback of ANIMs will usually require two buffers, as mentioned above, and double-buffering between them. The frame data from the ANIM file is used to modify the hidden frame to the next frame to be shown. When using the XOR mode, the usual run-length-decoding routine can be easily modified to do the exclusive-or operation required. Note that runs of zero bytes, which will be very common, can be ignored, as an exclusive or of any byte value to a byte of zero will not alter the original byte value. The general procedure, for all compression techniques, is to first decode the initial ILBM picture into the hidden buffer and double buffer it into view. Then this picture is copied to the other (now hidden) buffer. At this point each frame is displayed with the same procedure. The next frame is formed in the hidden buffer by applying the DLTA data (or the XOR data from the BODY chunk) and the new frame is double-buffered into view. This process continues to the end of the file.

==Influences of ANIM on other Animation filetypes==

The Anim standard of Amiga influenced the development of Animated GIF format.

<text>The Liverpool Echo is a newspaper published by Trinity Mirror North West &amp; North Wales – a subsidiary company of Reach plc and is based in St. Paul&#x27;s Square, Liverpool, England. It is published Monday through Sunday, and is Liverpool&#x27;s daily newspaper. Until January 13, 2012 , it had a sister morning paper, the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;. Between July and December 2022, it had an average daily circulation of 15,395.

Historically, the newspaper was published by the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo Ltd. Its office is in St Paul&#x27;s Square, Liverpool, having downsized from Old Hall Street in March 2018.

== History ==
In 1879, the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; was published as a cheaper sister paper to the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;. From its inception until 1917 the newspaper cost a halfpenny. It is now £1.40p Monday to Friday, £1.80p on Saturday and £1.40p on Sunday.

The limited company expanded internationally and underwent restructuring in 1985, becoming Trinity International Holdings Plc. Prior to this restructuring, the two original newspapers had recently been re-launched in tabloid format.

A special Sunday edition of the &quot;Echo&quot; was published on 16 April 1989, for reporting on the previous day&#x27;s Hillsborough disaster, in which 97 Liverpool F.C. fans were fatally injured at the FA Cup semi-final tie in Sheffield. Every single one of the 75,000 copies printed was sold.

In 1999 Trinity merged with Mirror Group Newspapers to become Trinity Mirror, the largest stable of newspapers in the country. In 2018, Trinity Mirror was rebranded as Reach plc.

On 7 January 2014 it was announced that a regular Sunday edition of the paper would be launched. The &quot;Sunday Echo&quot; is &quot;a seventh day of publication, not an independent product&quot;, according to the paper.

In 2008 the paper moved printing from Liverpool to Trinity Mirror Plc, Oldham, Greater Manchester, while journalists remain based at St Paul&#x27;s Square in Liverpool city centre.

In 2020, editor-in-chief Alistair Machray stood down and was replaced by Maria Breslin.

Criticism has been directed at the &quot;Echo&quot; for its perceived bias towards local politicians. In 2024, Liam Thorp, the paper&#x27;s political editor, collaborated on a book titled &quot;Head North: A Rallying Cry for a More Equal Britain&quot; with the metro mayors of Manchester and Liverpool, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram.

<text>Robert Jameson FRS FRSE (11 July 1774 – 19 April 1854) was a Scottish naturalist and mineralogist.

As Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh for fifty years, developing his predecessor John Walker&#x27;s concepts based on mineralogy into geological theories of Neptunism which held sway into the 1830s. Jameson is notable for his advanced scholarship, and his museum collection. The minerals and fossils collection of the Museum of Edinburgh University became one of the largest in Europe during Jameson&#x27;s long tenure at the university.

==Early life==
Jameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774, the son of Catherine Paton (1750–94) and Thomas Jameson (c.1750–1802), a soap manufacturer on Rotten Row (now Water Street). They lived on Sherrif Brae. His early education was spent at Leith Grammar School, after which he became the apprentice of the Leith surgeon John Cheyne (father of John Cheyne), with the aim of going to sea. He made his first trip to Shetland to study its geology in 1789, aged only 15, publishing his findings in 1793.

He attended classes at the University of Edinburgh (1792–93), studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. His father&#x27;s brother Robert Jameson, was also a physician and lived with them on Rotten Row.

By 1793, influenced by the Regius Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731–1803), Jameson abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship&#x27;s surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. It is worth noting that Walker was a presbyterian Minister who had actually combined the Regius Professorship with a period of service as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1790.

In 1793, Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University&#x27;s Natural History Collection. During this time his geological field-work frequently took him to the Isle of Arran, the Hebrides, Orkney, the Shetland Islands and the Irish mainland. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiberg, Saxony, where he studied under the noted geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749 or 1750–1817).

As an undergraduate, Jameson had several noteworthy classmates at the University of Edinburgh including Robert Brown, Joseph Black, and Thomas Dick.

In 1799 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Coventry, Thomas Charles Hope and Andrew Duncan.

==Regius Professor of Natural History, University of Edinburgh==

In 1804, Jameson succeeded Dr Walker as the third Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh, a post which he held for fifty years. During this period he became the first eminent exponent in Britain of the Wernerian geological system, or Neptunism, and the acknowledged leader of the Scottish Wernerians, founding the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808 and presiding from 1808 until around 1850, when his health began to decline, together with the fortunes of the Society. Jameson&#x27;s support for Neptunism, a theory that argued that all rocks had been deposited from a primaeval ocean, initially pitted him against James Hutton (1726–1797), a fellow Scot and eminent geologist also based in Edinburgh (but not in the university), who argued for the uniformitarian deistic concept of Plutonism, that features of the Earth&#x27;s crust were endlessly recycled in natural processes powered by magmatic molten rocks.

Later, Jameson was willing to join forces with the proponents of Hutton, in 1826 writing that &quot;the Wernerian geognostical views and method of investigation, combined with the theory of Hutton; the experiments and speculations of Hall; the illustrations of Playfair&quot;, had taken root in Edinburgh and spread to give Britain unsurpassed success in geology.

In the April–October 1826 edition of the quarterly &quot;Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal&quot; edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised &quot;Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day&quot; for having &quot;expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner.&quot; – this was the first use of the word &quot;evolved&quot; in a modern sense, and was the first significant statement to relate Lamarckism to the geological record of living organisms of the past. Attribution has been disputed, the concepts point to Jameson as the author, combining the directional geological history of Earth proposed by Neptunism with progressive transformism (transmutation of species) shown by fossils. It is possible that the article was written by one of his students, Ami Boué or Robert Edmond Grant. Jameson&#x27;s references to the Deluge in notes to his translation of Georges Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Theory of the Earth&quot; had done much to foster Catastrophism, but his 1827 edition referred to a &quot;succession of variations&quot; caused by environmental conditions having &quot;gradually conducted the classes of aquatic animals to their present state&quot;. and a later chapter described how &quot;like the formation of rocks, we observe a regular succession of organic formations, the later always descending from the earlier, down to the present inhabitants of the earth, and to the last created being who was to exercise dominion over them&quot;, summarising elements of the ideas of Giambattista Brocchi.

As a teacher, Jameson had a mixed reputation for imparting enthusiasm to his students. Thomas Carlyle, who gave serious attention to Natural History, described Jameson&#x27;s lecturing style as a &quot;blizzard of facts&quot;. Charles Darwin attended Robert Jameson&#x27;s natural history course at the University of Edinburgh in Darwin&#x27;s teenage years. Darwin found the lectures boring, saying that they determined him &quot;never to attend to the study of geology&quot;. The detailed syllabus of Jameson&#x27;s lectures, as drawn up by him in 1826, shows the range of his teaching. The course in zoology began with a consideration of the natural history of human beings, and concluded with lectures on the philosophy of zoology, in which the first subject was &quot;Origin of the Species of Animals&quot;. (&quot;The Scotsman&quot;, 29 October 1935: p. 8).

Over Jameson&#x27;s fifty-year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum of Edinburgh University, including fossils, birds and insects. By 1852 there were over 74,000 zoological and geological specimens at the museum, and in Britain the natural history collection was second only to that of the British Museum. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the British Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum, now the Royal Museum, in Edinburgh&#x27;s Chambers Street. He was also a prolific author of scientific papers and books, including the &quot;Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles&quot; (1800), his &quot;System of Mineralogy&quot; (1804), which ran to three editions, and &quot;Manual of Mineralogy&quot; (1821). In 1819, with Sir David Brewster (1781–1868), Jameson started the &quot;Edinburgh Philosophical Journal&quot; and became its sole editor in 1824.

He died at his home, 21 Royal Circus in Edinburgh, on 19 April 1854 after two years of illness, and was interred at Warriston Cemetery. He lies on the north side of the main east–west path near the old East Gate. He was succeeded in his post at Edinburgh University by Prof Edward Forbes.

==Artistic recognition==

A portrait of Robert Jameson is housed by the National Portrait Gallery in London, and a bust of him is in the Old College of the University of Edinburgh.

==Family==

Jameson never married and had no children.

He was the uncle of Robert William Jameson, Writer to the Signet and playwright of Edinburgh, and therefore also the great-uncle of Sir Leander Starr Jameson, Bt, KCMG, British colonial statesman.

His sister Janet Jameson (1776-1853) married Patrick Torrie (1763-1810). They were parents to Thomas Jameson Torrie FRSE a geologist.

A further nephew was William Jameson FRSE who rose to fame in India.

A species of venomous snake, &quot;Dendroaspis jamesoni&quot;, is named in honor of Robert Jameson.

A geological landmark in Newfoundland, Canada is named in his honour - Jameson Hills - named by a former student of his Wm. Eppes Cormack - the first European to traverse the interior of the island of Newfoundland

<doc id="537301" wikidata="Q2362130" url="?curid=537301" title="Temple (novel)">
<text>Temple is a thriller novel written by Australian author Matthew Reilly and first published in 1999. Like Reilly&#x27;s other books, Temple&#x27;s major attractions are the fast pace and the complexity of the action scenes.

At the time of publication, Reilly hinted at the possibility of a sequel starring the same protagonist, Professor William Race, but the release of such a book has never been officially confirmed.

== Introduction==

&quot;Temple&quot; is split into two stories, both set in South America: One set during the Spanish Occupation of South America and one set in 1999 at the same place.

The main focus of the former story is the journey of a monk named Alberto Santiago who becomes a traitor to his country after witnessing Spanish atrocities among the Incan civilisation. Aiding an Incan Prince named Renco Capac to escape, Santiago begins a quest to protect a special Idol - &#x27;The Spirit of the People&#x27;, an idol carved from black stone with purple veins running through it, actually carved from a meteorite that fell on earth, from the invading Spaniards. Upon his return to Spain, Santiago records his story in a transcript in San Sebastian Monastery in France.

Four hundred years later, a group of German armed militia known as the Stormtroopers raid the monastery, executing all but one of the Jesuit monks living there, recovering the Santiago manuscript. Meanwhile, another party raids DARPA (The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) headquarters in order to capture a new superweapon known as the Supernova. DARPA sends Colonel Frank Nash to Peru with the aid of NYU linguistics professor William Race to recover the idol before anyone else can retrieve it. Their mission: to retrieve &#x27;the Spirit of the People&#x27; (as the natives call it), carved out of Thyrium-261, a nuclear material from a binary star system that came to Earth via a meteorite. Thyrium has the potential to provide virtually limitless clean energy, which can fuel the Supernova, a next-generation weapon of mass destruction with the power to decimate a third of the Earth&#x27;s surface and bring about Doomsday.

==Plot summary==

=== William Race&#x27;s adventure ===
Professor William Race is a young linguist, working for NYU is approached by a retired Col. Frank Nash, a physicist from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to translate a manuscript written in ancient Latin, to find an ancient Incan idol in the South American jungles. Race is told that his brother, Martin Race, was the one who suggested his name, and that his ex college sweetheart, Lauren O&#x27;Connor is also accompanying them. Race reluctantly agrees.

En route to Peru, Nash provides Race with photocopied pages of a copy of the Santiago Manuscript, which describes the adventures of Alberto Santiago, a Spanish missionary in ancient Peru, whilst also holding the key to the final resting place of a legendary Incan idol, allegedly made of thyrium-261, an element that, when combined with the mass destruction weapon called Supernova, would destroy a third of the Earth&#x27;s mass throwing it off from its orbit and effectively killing the planet. The team travels to Cuzco, Peru with physicists Troy Copeland and Lauren O&#x27;Connor, archaeologist Gaby Lopez, anthropologist Walter Chambers and a team of six Green Berets, including Race&#x27;s personal bodyguard Leo Van Lewen.

Race, translating the copy of the manuscript that Frank Nash&#x27;s team had acquired prior to the flight to Peru, discovers that Santiago and his expedition ended up in Vilcafor, an Incan town deep in the Amazon. However, this was only a partially completed copy, so they didn&#x27;t know what occurred after Santiago&#x27;s arrival in Vilcafor. The team decide to use the information in the manuscript to make their way to Vilcafor and find out if the idol resides there.

After arriving in Cuzco, Race&#x27;s team makes use of Huey helicopters to travel into the Amazon and find Vilcafor, making use of the totem pole clues detailed in the manuscript. After some time in flight, the team finds Vilcafor and lands in the town center. Using a Nucleotide Resonance Imager (NRI), the team discovered a source of Thyrium-261 to the west of Vilcafor, and headed for the source.

This led them to a finger of rock in the middle of a canyon, on which sat an ancient temple, which Lopez and Chambers deduced to be pre-Incan. Nash decided to blow open the temple&#x27;s entrance with C-2 plastic explosive. However, as this was happening, the two Green Berets left to guard Vilcafor, Corporal &#x27;Doogie&#x27; Kennedy and Corporal &#x27;Tex&#x27; Reichart, were ambushed by a German assault team. The Germans took the town then with use of &#x27;Apache&#x27; attack helicopters took the temple from Nash&#x27;s team, taking them prisoner and putting them in the town.

The Germans decided to open the temple themselves. However, this unleashed the inhabitants of the temple known as rapas. Rapas, big cats likened to jaguars and previously considered no more than myth, emerged from the temple to first decimate the German temple team then descended on Vilcafor to tear apart the rest of the Germans. Nash&#x27;s team, separated, had to take drastic option to avoid their own deaths, but were able to survive with only the loss of Walt Chambers to the caimans, crocodilians lurking in the river next to Vilcafor. They were also able to pick up five members of the German team; two soldiers (Lt. Marc Graf and Corporal Molke), two members of the German&#x27;s equivalent of the FBI, the BKA (Bundes Kriminal Amt), which included Renee Becker and Karl Schroeder, and finally zoologist/cryptozoologist Johann Krauss.

Going on the assumption that the rapas would be averse to daylight, the team sent Green Berets Cpt. Scott and &#x27;Chuck&#x27; Wilson as well as one of the German soldiers (Lt. Graf) to the temple to make a second attempt at getting the idol. This failed in a massive bloodbath, with all three soldiers being killed by the rapas after a rapa ambush. They had wrongly assumed, with the rapas using the shade to attack.

Discovering that the Stormtroopers were on their way to Vilcafor, but with no knowing of when they would arrive, Nash&#x27;s team set to work. The German team had a completed copy of the manuscript, so Race started translating it. Making use of information from the German manuscript, the team decided to make a third attempt on the temple at night, this time sending Corporals &#x27;Buzz&#x27; Cochrane and &#x27;Tex&#x27; Reichart as well as Sgt. Van Lewen. They made use of monkey faeces acquired by Cochrane to put off the rapas and avoid attack.

However, as this occurred, the Stormtroopers finally made their appearance in Vilcafor, coming out of the rainforest. Using futuristic G-11 assault rifles, they ripped apart the rapas, taking the town. Their communications jammed, Nash sent Race ahead to warn their temple team. He caught up to the temple team as they emerged from the temple with the idol, also discovering a skeleton he presumed to be Renco Capac, the Incan prince in the manuscript. However, the Stormtroopers had also caught up with their own attack helicopter, killing Tex Reichart and wounding Buzz Cochrane. Reichart, having been in possession of the idol when he died, dropped the idol, sending it sliding down the hill. Race attempted to recover it, but almost fell off the top of the rock, using the grappling hook on his M-16 assault rifle to avoid being shot by the Stormtroopers. The Stormtroopers recover the idol and escape, while Race and Van Lewen, the last remaining mobile people on the rock, escaping as well, leaving Cochrane on top of the rock.

Race, Van Lewen, Doogie, Schroeder, Renee and Molke, using an Incan royal escape route under Vilcafor&#x27;s citadel, give chase to the neo-Nazi Stormtroopers, including Heinrich Anistaze, second in command to Odilo Ehrhardt. Using German jet skis, the team pursue the Nazis, losing Molke in the initial phase of the battle. The team disperses across the Nazi river armada, using divide and conquer techniques to make their force seem larger and disorienting the Nazis. Renee and Race are captured by Ehrhardt and Van Lewen and Doogie Kennedy manage to escape with the use of a Nazi seaplane. Karl Schroeder sacrifices himself using a chlorine isotopic charge that wipes out the rest of the Nazis.

Ehrhardt&#x27;s helicopter lands in the Nazi&#x27;s base of operations, a Peruvian gold mine, with Anistaze, Renee and Race aboard as well as Ehrhardt. Ehrhardt announces his plan to use the idol with his own Supernova to ransom the fate of the world to the U.S. Government in order to crash the American economy and build himself a new world. He then sent Race and Renee to be executed by two of his Nazi soldiers. However, they were saved by Uli Peck, a BKA undercover agent who had infiltrated the Nazis and allowed Renee&#x27;s German team to acquire their manuscript. Race stole the other Nazi&#x27;s kevlar breastplate from his body, then Renee, Uli and Race set off to stop Ehrhardt. They were confronted by Anistaze and Ehrhardt, with Race decapitating Anistaze and Uli being wounded.

Race managed to stop Ehrhardt and disarm the Nazi Supernova with only two seconds to spare before detonation, after the U.S. Government failed to come up with the ransom money. He had deduced that the weapon&#x27;s creator, Dr. Fritz Weber, a Nazi scientist who had been killed by Ehrhardt, had used his supposed execution date as the disarm code. However, the secondary explosion of hydrazine drums almost killed Race, but he managed to climb into the Supernova&#x27;s chamber, and was launched out of the area by the explosion, being recovered by Doogie&#x27;s seaplane along with Renee and Uli.

At this point, Race makes a litany of discoveries. He learns that Frank Nash is actually not retired, and is an active U.S. Army colonel, and that Nash&#x27;s team is the Army&#x27;s bid to justify their existence to the U.S. Congress and avoid liquidation, attempting to undercut the U.S. Navy and Air Force&#x27;s own bids to acquire the idol. Race also discovers that the idol is a fake, as it didn&#x27;t resonate when doused in water when the sprinkler system inside the room that the Nazi Supernova was housed had been triggered. His suspicions are confirmed through his final reading of the manuscript, this time using the original manuscript that the Nazis had stolen from the monastery.

Race returns to Vilcafor to join the others, and proves that the idol is indeed in an Incan village past the rock, which is where the NRI scan had actually pointed, not at the temple like the team had first assumed. The real idol is found at an altar, and the Incans there revere and worship Race, as he is found to have a birthmark below his left eye that is similar to Renco Capac&#x27;s birthmark, reputed to be the Mark of the Sun. Race is made to fight a caiman in order to prove he really is the Chosen One. Race with much difficulty manages to kill the caiman and is celebrated by the Incans. At this moment, the Navy expedition attacks, attempting a snatch-and-grab operation on the idol. Nash&#x27;s backup team also arrives, attacking and killing the Navy team&#x27;s Super Stallion helicopters with their own Comanche helicopters. Nash&#x27;s team arrived in Vilcafor, where they captured the Navy&#x27;s civilian team, which included Race&#x27;s brother Marty. Nash began executing the Navy civilians, Van Lewen, Renee and Race helpless as they were held at gunpoint by Troy Copeland. Marty is revealed as Nash&#x27;s co-conspirator, the man who had provided Nash with his copy of the manuscript. Race attempts to reveal that Lauren, Marty&#x27;s wife, had been cheating on him with Copeland, but Race is silenced by Marty. Van Lewen is killed by Nash after Van Lewen stepped in front of Nash&#x27;s gun. Nash attempts to kill Race, but is interrupted by the Incan natives who shoot Nash in the arm with an arrow and ambush the town. Race is again saved after the escaping Nash&#x27;s gunner is killed by Doogie while attempting to kill Race and Renee with the Army helicopter&#x27;s cannon.

Nash&#x27;s team is then set back down by another attacking team, this time a rogue militia known as the Republican Army of Texas. They had recently merged with the Oklahoma Freedom Fighters, a technological militia, and a Japanese doomsday terrorist group. This was the team that had stolen the DARPA Supernova from their headquarters, with the sole purpose of destroying the world. This team was led by Earl Bittiker, a brutal former Navy SEAL. It is revealed by Copeland that he has been in league with Bittiker, betraying Lauren, who had betrayed Marty. Lauren is shot to death by Copeland, while Nash is wounded by Bittiker. Marty is also mortally wounded, but with his final breath clues to Race that Marty was the ignition creator of the DARPA Supernova. The Texans depart with the idol in their possession.

Race, Renee, Doogie and Gaby Lopez give chase in Doogie&#x27;s seaplane in order to foil the Texan&#x27;s plan. The Texans board an Antonov An-22 cargo plane and using their Supernova that they have stored in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, activate the Supernova. Race commences his one-man assault on the plane, boarding it from the rear loading ramp in mid-air. He manages to get inside the Abrams tank with the Supernova. However, he is accosted by Bittiker. Race starts up the tank&#x27;s engine, which unbalances Bittiker, then fires the main gun of the tank, managing to decapitate Copeland and kill the Antonov&#x27;s pilot, sending the plane nosediving. Race then reversed the tank out of the plane and into the sky.

With the tank free-falling and Bittiker attempting to get inside, having managed to hold on, Race starts trying to disarm the Supernova. Using the information of Marty being the designer of the Supernova&#x27;s ignition system, he deduces that Marty, as a massive Elvis Presley fan, used Elvis&#x27; army serial code for the disarm code of the Supernova. Race manages to disarm the Supernova with 4 seconds to spare, saving the world from destruction. He escapes the falling tank, with Bittiker now trapped inside, and is saved by the breastplate that he had stolen from the dead Nazi in the mine, which turns out to be an experimental DARPA jet pack which had been stolen by the Nazis along with fifteen other jet packs two years previously. Bittiker has no such luck and is killed by the monumental impact of the ground, still inside the tank.

Now Race, Renee, Doogie, Gaby and Uli fly back to the village. Race lures the rapas back into the temple using the idol, wet in order to hypnotise the rapas with the resonance of the idol. Race places the fake idol near the entrance to fool any potential future temple raiders, and notices the bodies left by the Incan natives as sacrifice to the rapas among them including the Navy and Army teams, and sees the treasure of Solon so long sought by explorers over history, but is not tempted and leaves it behind. He manages finds an alternative route out, trapping the rapas back in the temple. Race returns the real idol back to the Indians, advising them to leave the village for elsewhere as more people may come in search for the idol, and departs with the others for home.

===Alberto Santiago&#x27;s Story===
Santiago&#x27;s story takes place five hundred years prior to the main events of the story, in South America. It is told in the form of a story within a story, the memoirs of a Spanish priest during the discovery of South America. Santiago&#x27;s manuscript appears several times in the story, with Professor Race reading and translating it, providing his comrades with crucial information to reach the idol.

Disgusted by the atrocities of his countrymen on the Incans, Spanish priest Alberto Santiago betrays them when he frees Renco Capac, an Incan prince, from a spanish prison hulk. Much of Santiago&#x27;s story details his journey with Renco and a criminal named Bassario from Cuzco to the citadel at Vilcafor as they attempt to defend a sacred Incan idol from pursuing conquistadors, led by the wicked Spanish leader Hernando. The Spaniards wish to conquer the Incas and also grab a hidden treasure, as well as kill Alberto for his treachery. The trio travel day in and night out and finally make it to Vilcafor with the idol, where they hope to hide it before Hernando can find them.

At Vilcafor, Alberto is introduced to Renco&#x27;s widowed sister and her young son, and the other Incans hiding in the citadel. He learns of the Vicious Rapas that come out of the temple at night, and that when made wet, the idol hums a tune which puts the Rapas in a trance. Renco has Bassario make an exact replica of the idol which is fake. Alberto also learns of a treasure hidden in a temple built by one Solon years before, and guarded by Rapas, which the Spaniards are after. The Incans and Alberto reach the temple with the idol keeping the Rapas in trance, and manage to lure them all into the temple, but are attacked by Hernando and the conquistadors before they can completely close the door. Hernando gets the &quot;fake&quot; idol from Renco, but before he can kill them, the conquistadors are attacked by Bassario and the Incans and the returning Rapas. In the fight, Alberto is saved by his bible as it absorbs Hernando&#x27;s shot. Hernando is killed by Santiago on the rope bridge and the Spaniards are killed by the Incans. Renco then lures the Rapas back into the temple and asks that the stone door be shut behind them, thereby trapping the Rapas inside with him and the idols.

===Epilogue===
As Professor William Race and the others head home, Race calls and appraises the investigation officers back home about the events. He then proceeds to read the last part of Alberto Santiago&#x27;s manuscript, which he gets from the village.

Alberto Santiago is now an old man, reminiscing his memories and penning them in a monastery in the mountains of Europe. Renco trapped the Rapas and the fake idol and escaped from the temple with the real one (the same way Race did) and reunited with his comrades. Bassario now has joined the Incas, Alberto married Lena and has two daughters with her. Renco and Alberto are long lived friends, until Lena and Renco pass away in old age. Alberto ends his writings with a short poem sung by the Incans, praising their hero Renco. Race notes that he has the same mark beneath his left eye as described in Renco, but at the very end has the epiphany that only Race had fallen from the sky to save the idol, while Renco hadn&#x27;t. This implies that Race is in fact the one and only Chosen One as foretold by the Incans.

==Characters==

===&quot;Civilians (American)&quot;===

William Race The main protagonist. He is an ancient languages professor at New York University. He is unwillingly dragged into a US army special operation by Francis Nash. He is highly inspired by the story of Alberto Santiago&#x27;s adventure with Renco Capac and several similarities are shown between him and Renco. He later kisses his love interest, Renee Becker, near the end of the story.

Troy Copeland A nuclear physicist, who is part of Nash&#x27;s scam to steal the idol for hostile purposes. He was having an affair with Lauren, and using the information she got from her husband he aided Bittiker in detonating the Supernova. Race later kills him with a tank shell to the head

Lauren O&#x27;Conner Married to the brother of her college sweetheart, William Race, she too is in on Nash&#x27;s scam. She was having an affair with Copeland, and giving him secrets that her husband Marty knew, which aided Copeland in setting up the Supernova with the idol for the Texans, which Lauren didn&#x27;t know. Copeland later shoots her.

Walter Chambers The anthropologist of the crew. Shown as bookish but capable, and spots the threat of the rapas early. Chambers is brutally killed by vicious caimans, massive crocodilians.

Gaby Lopez The archaeologist of the team, she survives the horrors of Peru. She was seconds from death when Doogie saved her from a caiman. She later asks Doogie out for dinner.

Martin Race Brother of William Race, whom William hasn&#x27;t seen in years. It is revealed towards the end that he is married to Lauren, but he in fact was being manipulated by Lauren to suit her needs.

===&quot;American Armed Forces Members&quot;===

Colonel Francis Nash Claims to be part of DARPA, but is revealed to be an Army man. He betrays his own squad and shoots Van Lewen and the Navy comrades. He brought along Chambers, Lopez and Race to aid him, and Copeland and Lauren to steal the idol from its rightful owner, the Incan people. He is later mutilated by the Indians and sacrificed to the rapas for his crimes.

Captain Dwayne Scott, the leader of the Green Berets. He dies a painful death when the second venture into the Incan temple results in a rapa attack.

Sergeant Leonardo Van Lewen, Race&#x27;s assigned bodyguard. A considerate and resourceful man, as well as a leader by example, he helps Race in his quest to stop the Nazis and then stop Nash. He makes the ultimate sacrifice for Race, stepping in front of him when Nash brandishes a gun. Nash shoots Van Lewen anyway.

Corporal Jacob &quot;Buzz&quot; Cochrane is part of the team that goes into the temple for the third time. A crude and egotistical soldier, he is disliked by Race for this and later is wounded by the Nazis. Left on the rock, he is discovered by the Incans later and sacrificed to the rapas.

Corporal George &quot;Tex&quot; Reichart is shot fatally in the same attack that wounded Cochrane during the retrieval of the idol. One of the only members of the Green Berets apart from Van Lewen that appreciated Doogie Kennedy.

Corporal Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Wilson, like Captain Scott, is mauled by rapas in the first venture into the temple. Is seemingly as crude as Cochrane, as he participates in the tasteless &quot;80s Club&quot;, a club whose members have had sex with women born in the 1980s (the events of &quot;Temple&quot; take place in early 1999, so that means any woman in their teens, making for a very crude concept).

Corporal Douglas &quot;Doogie&quot; Kennedy is the only Green Beret that survives. A shy young man that is bullied by many of his fellow Green Berets for his Southern accent and his crush on Gaby Lopez, he is in fact a very smart guy and a more than capable soldier with exceptional sniper skills as well as a capable pilot. He is asked out by Gaby Lopez and accepts at the end of the book.

===&quot;German BKA team&quot;===
Karl Schroeder The de facto leader after the German leader is killed in the initial rapa attack, he is much like Van Lewen, leading by example and being considerate for his fellow men. He makes the sacrifice play when the team raids the Nazi armada, setting off a chlorine isotopic charge to vaporise the remaining Nazis and allowing the others to escape.

Renee Becker A special agent for the BKA along with Karl Schroeder, she is a kind woman but capable fighter. Race&#x27;s love interest, she earlier dismisses his brave acts as only the adrenaline talking, but when Race disables the second Supernova, she decides that he is truly as brave as his actions demonstrates, and kisses him. They&#x27;re seen together at the end of the book.

Uli Peck Masquerading as Nazi soldier Uli Kahr, he infiltrated the Nazis to feed information to the BKA. Rescued Race and Renee from certain execution at the hands of the Nazis and aided them in disabling the Nazi Supernova.

===&quot;Nazi team&quot;===
Heinrich Anistaze Ex-German secret policeman, brutal and lethal, seeks to set up a Nazi ruled world by crashing the U.S. economy with Odilo Ehrhardt&#x27;s plan and using the thyrium from the idol to fuel the Nazi Supernova. Later brutally killed by William Race by decapitation with the blades of a helicopter.

Odilo Ehrhardt Ex-Nazi guard at a Nazi concentration camp in World War Two. Known as a heartless killer during his time with the Nazi regime. Set up and leads the Stormtroopers, his neo-Nazi regime based in Chile. Is killed by William Race after being shot by Race and then blown up by his own hydrazine explosive trap, while failing to kill Race.

=== Republican Army of Texas ===
Earl Bittiker A former Navy Seal, he formed the Texans as a militia group that raided government buildings. Later merged with the Oklahoma Freedom Fighters and a Japanese doomsday group in order to acquire a Supernova and use it to destroy the world. Killed by William Race after being trapped by Race in a falling tank.

===&quot;Santiago&#x27;s story&quot;===

Alberto Santiago Main protagonist, Spanish priest and missionary who on his journey with the Spaniards in their quest to conquer the Incas, witnesses the brutality of his countrymen and decides to betray them and help the Incans instead, inspired by the Incans and their spirit and will. Kills Hernando Pizarro to save the idol. Marries Lena, Renco&#x27;s sister, and later returns to France to write the manuscript.

Prince Renco Capac Incan prince, highly skilled and hailed by the Incans as their hero, imprisoned on a ship, is released by Santiago, and who partners with the latter to confiscate and protect a sacred Incan idol from the Spanish Conquistadors. Presumed killed by Race before Race discovered he in fact survived luring the rapas into the temple, using this information to himself survive the temple.

Lena An Incan princess, she similarly mirrors Renee Becker with Race in being Santiago&#x27;s love interest.

Bassario The disgraced son of a royal stonemason, he is convicted to prison. Freed by Renco in order to use his skills to construct a fake idol in order to fool Hernando Pizarro. Initially leaves Renco and Santiago to their deaths at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors, but returns in the nick of time to save their lives, proving he was still an honourable man.

Hernando Pizarro The brother of the Spanish conqueror&#x27;s governor, Francisco, a brutal man who revelled in killing the Incans and stopped at nothing to possess the idol. He was killed by Santiago by being dropped off the rope bridge.

Castino A tribesman of the subjugated Chanca clan, he joined the Spanish conquistadors led by Hernando in order to get revenge on Renco, using his tracking skills to aid the Spanish. He was decapitated by Renco in the final battle atop the temple.

<text>The Liverpool Post was a newspaper published by Trinity Mirror in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. The newspaper and its website ceased publication on 19 December 2013.

Until 13 January 2012 it was a daily morning newspaper, with the title &quot;The Liverpool Daily Post&quot;. It retained the name &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; for its website, which continued to offer a daily service of news, business and sport to the people of Merseyside until the closure of the publication. The &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; split from its sister North Wales title, &quot;The Daily Post&quot;, which still publishes six days a week, in 2003. The newspaper has been published since 1855. Historically the newspaper was published by the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo Ltd.

The &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; was first published in 1855 by Michael James Whitty. Whitty, a former Chief Constable for Liverpool, had campaigned for the abolition of the Stamp Act under which newspapers were taxed. When the abolition took place, Whitty began publishing the &quot;Daily Post&quot; at one penny per copy, undercutting the incumbent best-selling Liverpudlian newspaper, the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot;.

In 1904 the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; merged with the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; but its title was retained. The limited company expanded internationally and in 1985 was restructured as Trinity Holdings. The two original newspapers had just previously been re-launched in tabloid format. In 1999 Trinity merged with Mirror Group Newspapers to become Trinity Mirror, the largest stable of newspapers in the UK.

On 31 January 2009, the &quot;Daily Post&quot; published its final Saturday edition, and from then only published Monday-Friday. The &quot;Daily Post&#x27;s&quot; final appearance was on 13 January 2012, after which it became a weekly paper simply known as &quot;The Liverpool Post&quot; published every Thursday.

In the period December 2010 – June 2011, the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; had an average daily circulation of 8,217 while the &quot;North Wales Daily Post&quot; edition had an average daily circulation of 31,802, bringing the total to just over 40,000.

On 10 December 2013, the &quot;Liverpool Post&quot; announced it was to cease publishing after more than 158 years. The final edition was printed on 19 December 2013.

Its sister publication, the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, is now the sole daily newspaper in Liverpool.

<doc id="537311" wikidata="Q1967139" url="?curid=537311" title="Degree of truth">
<text>In classical logic, propositions are typically unambiguously considered as being true or false. For instance, the proposition &quot;one is both equal and not equal to itself&quot; is regarded as simply false, being contrary to the Law of Noncontradiction; while the proposition &quot;one is equal to one&quot; is regarded as simply true, by the Law of Identity. However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be &quot;more or less&quot; true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider &quot;My coffee is hot&quot;.

In mathematics, this idea can be developed in terms of fuzzy logic. In computer science, it has found application in artificial intelligence. In philosophy, the idea has proved particularly appealing in the case of vagueness. Degrees of truth is an important concept in law.

The term is an older concept than conditional probability. Instead of determining the objective probability, only a subjective assessment is defined. Especially for novices in the field, the chance for confusion is high. They are highly likely to confound the concept of probability with the concept of degree of truth. To overcome the misconception, it makes sense to see probability theory as the preferred paradigm to handle uncertainty.

In adjudicative processes, &#x27;substantive truth&#x27; is distinct from &#x27;formal legal truth&#x27; which comes in four degrees: hearsay, balance of probabilities, proven beyond reasonable doubt and absolute truth (knowledge reserved unto God).

<doc id="537314" wikidata="Q25380699" url="?curid=537314" title="Liverpool Mercury">
<text>The Liverpool Mercury was an English newspaper that originated in Liverpool, England. As well as focusing on local news, the paper also reported on both national and international news allowing it to circulate in Lancashire, Wales, Isle of Man and London.

==History==
Founded by Egerton Smith in 1811 the newspaper cost 7d and was published weekly, covering news relating to the city&#x27;s busy port. By 1858 the newspaper switched from being a weekly paper to a daily, with an extended edition published on Fridays. The paper&#x27;s second edition was claimed to be 72 columns long, making it one of the largest newspapers in the world. During the early 1900s the &quot;Mercury&quot; merged with rival paper &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; to become the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post and the Liverpool Mercury&quot; whose first edition was published on 14 November 1904.

The &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; supported the successful bid by Thomas Colley Porter to become Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1827. Parliamentary historian Margaret Escott says that the election, in which Porter beat Nicholas Robinson by 1,780 votes to 1,765, was &quot;the most expensive, venal and violent mayoral contest&quot; up to that time. Votes were bought at prices ranging between £6 and £50, with the candidates spending in total around £8,000–10,000 each. The two sides co-operated with a subsequent inquiry that resulted in three people being prosecuted and disenfranchised for bribery.

<doc id="537316" wikidata="Q7328676" url="?curid=537316" title="Richard Rigby">
<text>Richard Rigby PC (February 1722 – 8 April 1788), was an English civil servant and politician who sat in the British House of Commons for 43 years from 1745 to 1788. He served as Chief Secretary for Ireland and Paymaster of the Forces. Rigby accumulated a fortune serving the Crown and politician wheeler-dealers in the dynamic 18th-century parliament.

==Background and education==
The Rigby family took Mistley Hall in Essex as the site of their manor, but was descended from the Rigby of Burgh family. Rigby&#x27;s father and immediate ancestors made a fortune as merchant drapers in the City of London, as merchants and colonial officers in the West Indies, and as speculators in the South Sea Bubble. Richard Rigby&#x27;s father also had the same name, and was significant in the history of Jamaica, serving as its secretary, the provost marshal, and a member of the Royal Assembly in the late 17th and early 18th century.

He was also part-owner of a plantation in Antigua and a slave trader. His elder brother James also served as a colonial officer on the island. Richard and James Rigby were sons of Edward Rigby of Mistley Hall, a London draper and landowner based in Covent Garden, and Anne Hyde, a close cousin of Queen Anne (Hyde), Queen Anne, Queen Mary, and the Earl of Clarendon. Edward and Ann had a London townhouse in the parish of St Andrews High Holborn. Rigby was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and the Middle Temple.

==Political career==
Rigby was elected Member of Parliament for Castle Rising in 1745, transferring to Sudbury at the next general election, and was initially a partisan of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Subsequently, he transferred his allegiance to the Duke of Bedford, sitting as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Bedford pocket borough of Tavistock and eventually becoming the Bedford Whigs&#x27; permanent &quot;man of business&quot; in the House of Commons.

In December 1755 he became a junior minister as one of the Lords of Trade and in 1757, he retained a seat in the Irish House of Commons for Old Leighlin, which he held until 1761. When Bedford was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1758, in a time of relative peace, Rigby accompanied him as Secretary; the following year he was appointed Master of the Rolls in Ireland. In theory, this was a senior judicial office, but in practice, it was a sinecure and Rigby never sat as a judge. In 1762 Rigby was seriously considered for promotion to Secretary at War, but he preferred to remain in lucrative sinecures rather than to accept more substantive office, and instead was made in 1765 joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. His career was also hampered by his violent temper, which caused him to lash out indiscriminately at everyone around him, although when in a good temper he was a model of courtesy and charm. All those who knew him admitted to finding him a puzzling and contradictory character.

In 1768, Rigby was transferred to perhaps the most lucrative of all government posts, Paymaster of the Forces, which he held for the next 16 years. He took a prominent part in opposing John Wilkes, and later led objections to a public funeral for Pitt the Elder. When he died in 1788, he was said to have left &quot;nearly half a million of public money&quot;.

==Wealth==
Rigby spent much of his fortune reinvesting in the family seats of Mistley and Manningtree, employing the top architects and landscape artists of the day to build a port and a spa. The latter endeavour failed, but the ruins of Mistley Towers survive as a tourist destination. Though other members of the family continued to bear the Rigby name and arms, the bulk of Richard Rigby&#x27;s wealth fell to his sister Martha who married General Bernard Hale, and ultimately to the Pitt-Rivers family. Richard had an illegitimate daughter called Sarah by Sarah Lucas (widow), of Ipswich.

<text>Joseph Guillaume François &quot;Jef&quot; Denyn ( ; 19 March 1862 – 2 October 1941) was a Belgian carillon player from Mechelen. He originally studied to be an engineer. His carilloning career started in 1881 when his father, the official carilloneer of Mechelen, went blind and became unable to play. This caused Denyn to take over. In 1887, Denyn was recognised for his skills and officially appointed to the same position his father had held. He used his engineering knowledge to vastly improve the technology surrounding carillons, which is now used all over Europe and the United States. In 1922, he founded the world&#x27;s first and most renowned international higher institute of campanology, later named after him, the Royal Carillon School &quot;Jef Denyn&quot; () in Mechelen.

During the First World War, he, his wife Helene, son and four daughters were among those Belgian refugees who fled to England. The Denyn family were taken in by organist and musicologist William Wooding Starmer (1866–1927) in his house in Tunbridge Wells.

<text>Kim Wilde (born Kim Smith, 18 November 1960) is an English pop singer. She first gained success in 1981 with her debut single &quot;Kids in America&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in the UK. In 1983, she received the Brit Award for Best British Female solo artist. In 1986, she had a UK No. 2 hit with a reworked version of the Supremes&#x27; song &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;, which also topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1987. Between 1981 and 1996, she had 25 singles that charted within the Top 50 of the UK Singles Chart. Her other hits include &quot;Chequered Love&quot; (1981), &quot;You Came&quot; (1988), and &quot;Never Trust a Stranger&quot; (1988). In 2003, she collaborated with Nena on the song &quot;Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime&quot;, which topped the Dutch and Austrian charts.

She holds the record for being the most-charted British female solo act of the 1980s, with seventeen UK Top 40 hit singles. Starting in 1998, while still active in music, she has branched into an alternative career as a landscape gardener, which has included presenting gardening shows on the BBC and Channel 4. In 2005, she won a Gold award for her courtyard garden at the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Chelsea Flower Show.

==Early life==

She was born as Kim Smith in the West London suburb of Chiswick, the eldest child of 1950s rock and roller Marty Wilde (birth name Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker, who had been a member of the singing and dancing group the Vernons Girls. She attended Oakfield Preparatory School, in the Southeast London area of Dulwich. When she was nine, the family moved to Hertfordshire, where she was educated at Tewin and later Presdales School. In 1980, at age 20, she completed a foundation course at St Albans College of Art &amp; Design. As Kim Wilde, she was signed to RAK Records by Mickie Most.

==Music career==
Wilde&#x27;s first professional singing credit was as a backup singer to her brother Ricky&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;I Am an Astronaut.&quot;

===The RAK years===
Wilde&#x27;s father Marty and brother, Ricky, were responsible for writing virtually all of her material in the early-to-mid 1980s. Key influences on the songwriting process included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Ultravox, John Foxx, Gary Numan, Skids, Sex Pistols, the Clash, Kraftwerk and the Stranglers. Wilde released her debut single &quot;Kids in America&quot; in January 1981. An instant success, it reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia. Although it achieved only moderate success in the US, peaking at No. 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde&#x27;s signature song. Her debut studio album &quot;Kim Wilde&quot; (1981) repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in &quot;Chequered Love&quot; (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single &quot;Water on Glass&quot; (UK No. 11).

Wilde&#x27;s follow-up album was 1982&#x27;s &quot;Select&quot;, led by the hit singles &quot;Cambodia&quot; and &quot;View from a Bridge&quot;. Both were No. 1 hits in France and reached Top 10 positions in Germany and Australia. At the time, there was some controversy about Wilde&#x27;s hesitation to do live concerts. Her first concerts in September 1982 took place in Denmark, before embarking on a UK-wide tour in October. Wilde&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Catch as Catch Can&quot; (1983) was a relative commercial failure. The first single from the album, &quot;Love Blonde&quot;, was another success in France and Scandinavia, but failed to have major success in other countries. The failure of the album led to her leaving RAK and signing with MCA Records in the summer of 1984.

===The MCA years===
Wilde&#x27;s first album for MCA &quot;Teases &amp; Dares&quot; (1984) was again overlooked in her home country, but fared better in Germany, France and Scandinavia as well as scoring another German Top 10 single with &quot;The Second Time&quot; (which was Top 30 in the UK). The video for this song appeared in an episode of the 1980s TV hit &quot;Knight Rider&quot; in 1985. The second single, &quot;The Touch&quot;, was not a commercial success, but the third single, the rockabilly &quot;Rage to Love&quot; (the video for which features a cameo appearance by Justin Hayward, guitarist and frontman of the Moody Blues) made the UK top 20 in 1985. On &quot;Teases &amp; Dares&quot;, Wilde made her first songwriting contributions, penning two songs. Meanwhile, she had embarked on three European concert tours (1983, 1985 and 1986).

On her fifth studio album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Another Step&quot;, Wilde wrote or co-wrote most of the songs. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Schoolgirl&quot; flopped in Europe and Australia, but Wilde&#x27;s fortunes improved in spectacular fashion with the album&#x27;s second single, a Hi-NRG remake of the Supremes classic &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;. After topping the charts in Australia and Canada and peaking at No. 2 in the UK, it became a US No. 1 single in 1987. With that hit, she became the fifth UK female solo artist ever to top the US Hot 100, following Petula Clark, Lulu, Sheena Easton, and Bonnie Tyler. Her popularity, especially in her native UK, was revitalised and she scored further Top 10 hits in 1987 with &quot;Another Step (Closer to You)&quot; (recorded with Junior) and &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; (a Comic Relief charity single, recorded with comedian Mel Smith).

In 1988, Wilde released her biggest selling album to date, &quot;Close&quot;, which returned her to the UK top 10 and spent almost eight months on the UK album chart. It produced four major European hits: &quot;Hey Mister Heartache&quot;, &quot;You Came&quot;, &quot;Never Trust a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Four Letter Word&quot; (the last 3 were Top 10 hits in the UK). The release of the album coincided with a tour of Europe, where she was the opening act for Michael Jackson&#x27;s Bad World Tour. Wilde released her next studio album, &quot;Love Moves&quot;, in 1990. The album barely made the UK Top 40, and, although it was a Top 10 success in Scandinavian countries, it failed to sell as well as its predecessor and only spawned two minor hits, &quot;It&#x27;s Here&quot; a Top 20 success in Middle and Northern Europe as well as &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough (Of Your Love)&quot;, her last Top 20 hit in France. She toured Europe again as the opening act for David Bowie.

A collaboration with Rick Nowels, who had produced hits for Stevie Nicks and Belinda Carlisle, resulted in the guitar-driven pop of the single &quot;Love Is Holy&quot; and the album &quot;Love Is&quot; (1992). The album&#x27;s success was again limited to a small number of countries, though the single became another Top 20 hit in the UK, and the second single (&quot;Heart over Mind&quot;) also made the Top 40. In 1993, she released her first official compilation album &quot;The Singles Collection 1981–1993&quot;, which was a success throughout Europe and Australia and the dancefloor-influenced single &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; (a cover of the Yvonne Elliman song from the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; that was penned by the Bee Gees), became her last UK Top 20 Hit as well as a No. 3 hit in Australia.

Wilde embarked on a huge &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; concert tour through Europe in 1994 and also toured Australia and Japan for the first time in six years. Her next studio album, &quot;Now &amp; Forever&quot; (1995), was a commercial failure worldwide. Her single &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot;, however, was a minor hit, and the follow-up, &quot;This I Swear&quot;, was also a minor hit in Europe. She released the single &quot;Shame&quot; in 1996, an Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King cover. From February 1996 to February 1997, Wilde appeared in London&#x27;s West End production of the rock musical, &quot;Tommy&quot;.

===Return to pop===

Since November 2001, Wilde has toured the UK three times (and once in Australia during 2003) as part of the Here and Now Tour, an Eighties revival concert series, together with artists such as Paul Young, the Human League, Belinda Carlisle, Howard Jones and Five Star. New recordings also followed; in 2001, she recorded a new track, &quot;Loved&quot;, for a compilation album which became a surprise hit in Belgium. She recorded the single &quot;Born to be Wild&quot; in 2002, and in summer of 2003 she had a major hit with &quot;Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime&quot;, a duet with German pop star Nena. The single was a Top 10 hit in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands and Switzerland.

In 2006, Wilde signed a new recording contract with EMI Germany and released the first single from her tenth studio album in many countries across Europe, Scandinavia and Asia. &quot;You Came 2006&quot; charted Top 20 in most of these countries and became her biggest solo hit in Germany since 1988. The album &quot;Never Say Never&quot; included eight new tracks plus five re-worked previous hits and has charted in Belgium, France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The second single from the album, which was voted for by fans on her official website was &quot;Perfect Girl&quot;, released in November 2006 and spent nine weeks on the German Top 100 singles chart. A third single, &quot;Together We Belong&quot;, was released in March 2007 and a fourth single, &quot;Baby Obey Me&quot;, was released in Germany as a remix featuring German rapper Ill Inspecta.

Since 2003, Wilde has appeared on numerous festival bills and concerts all over Europe with her own band. In early September 2009, a brand new single, &quot;Run to You&quot;, recorded as a duet with Swedish rock band Fibes, Oh Fibes!, was released in Sweden. The song reached the Swedish Top 30.

In 2010, Wilde signed a new recording contract with Sony Music Germany. The label released her eleventh studio album, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; on 17 August, with &quot;Lights Down Low&quot; preceding that as lead single. The album peaked at No. 10 in Germany and was followed by a tour in Europe in February and March 2011.

Wilde&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Snapshots&quot;, was released on 26 August 2011 and featured cover versions of songs hand-picked from the last five decades. A double release of &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Satellite&quot; was released on 19 August as the lead single. Two further singles failed to reach the chart. Wilde toured in support of the album in Germany in March 2012. In November 2012, Wilde was featured as the lead vocalist on Reflekt&#x27;s &quot;A Beautiful House&quot;.

Wilde released her next studio album, &quot;Wilde Winter Songbook&quot; in November 2013. On 18 December 2017, Wilde released a Christmas single with Lawnmower Deth titled &quot;F U Kristmas!&quot;. Wilde released her fourteenth studio album &quot;Here Come the Aliens&quot; on 16 March 2018. It was inspired by an encounter with a UFO she had in 2009. While sitting in her garden with her husband and a friend, they noticed something odd about the sky and experienced an eerie silence. They observed a huge bright light behind a cloud. Being curious she walked down the grass to track the source of the light and what she noticed was that the light was swiftly moving back and forth. She thought about it every day and it gave her the idea for her new album.

In May 2021, Wilde confirmed she would celebrate 40 years of music with the release of a box set greatest hits album titled, &quot;Pop Don&#x27;t Stop: Greatest Hits&quot;. The album was released in August 2021.

==Impact and recognition==

Wilde holds the record for being the most-charted British female solo act of the 1980s, with seventeen UK Top 40 hit singles throughout the decade (including her duets with Junior Giscombe and Mel Smith).

A number of artists have performed covers of Kim Wilde songs, ranging from pop and rock to dance and death metal versions. On 16 February 1991, then Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl recorded a version of &quot;Kids in America&quot; in an Arlington County, Virginia basement studio. It is the third track on the rare 2015 &quot;Songs from the Laundry Room&quot; Foo Fighters EP, a clip of which plays during the credit roll of the Seattle, Washington episode of Grohl&#x27;s Sonic Highways documentary TV series. American pop star Tiffany recorded a version of &quot;Kids in America&quot; in 2007 for her album &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now: &#x27;80s Hits and More&quot;. German eurodance act Cascada, recorded a version of &quot;Kids in America&quot;, on their &quot;Everytime We Touch&quot; album in 2007.

Wilde has provided inspiration for other artists, including Charlotte Hatherley, who wrote a song about her entitled &quot;Kim Wilde&quot;, and included it on her debut album, &quot;Grey Will Fade&quot;. East German punk rock band Feeling B also recorded a song called &quot;Kim Wilde&quot;, which featured on their debut album, &quot;Hea Hoa Hoa Hea Hea Hoa&quot; (1989). In 1985, French singer Laurent Voulzy paid tribute to Wilde in his song &quot;Les Nuits Sans Kim Wilde&quot; (&quot;The Nights without Kim Wilde&quot;). In her graphic novel &quot;Persepolis&quot;, Iranian cartoonist Marjane Satrapi has a comic strip titled &quot;Kim Wilde&quot;. In it the main character Marji, a young Iranian girl, sings &quot;Kids in America&quot; in the streets of the Iranian capital. Also, when her parents go on holiday in Turkey, they buy a poster of Wilde and smuggle it into Tehran for Marji. Marji pins the poster on her bedroom&#x27;s wall and practises emulating Wilde.

==Gardening career==
During her first pregnancy, an old interest in gardening resurfaced and she attended Capel Manor College to learn about horticulture, so as to create a garden for her children. As a celebrity, she was asked by Channel 4 to act as a designer for their programme &quot;Better Gardens&quot;. A year later, she started a two-year commitment with the BBC, recording two series of &quot;Garden Invaders&quot;.

In 2001, she (along with fellow horticulturist David Fountain) created the &quot;All About Alice&quot; garden for the Tatton Flower Show and was awarded the &#x27;Best Show Garden&#x27; award. In 2005, she won a Gold award for her courtyard garden at the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Chelsea Flower Show. She has designed and created numerous gardens during her involvement in the &quot;Better Gardens&quot; and &quot;Garden Invaders&quot; TV programmes and commissioned by individuals and organisations. She has also created gardens for flower shows across the UK. In 2001 she was involved in setting a world record for the largest tree transplantation, when a London plane was moved from Belgium to a development site in Warrington. After standing in its new location for six years, however, the tree was toppled by Cyclone Kyrill in January 2007.

===Publications===
Wilde has written two books as part of her gardening career. The first, &quot;Gardening with Children&quot;, was released on 4 April 2005 by Collins publishers. Translations of the book were released at the same time in Spain, France, Denmark and the Netherlands, and later in Germany. Her second book, &quot;The First-Time Gardener&quot;, was released on 3 April 2006 (again by Collins), and is a beginner&#x27;s guide to gardening.

==TV and Radio==
Wilde broadened her eco-friendly image by taking on advertising jobs for various &#x27;green&#x27; companies. For two years, she featured on advertisements for the highstreet health food shop Holland &amp; Barrett. She wrote infomercials for Bold and Timotei, and in 2008, she started advertising &#x27;green kitchens&#x27; for Magnet. In 2019, Cadbury featured Wilde in one of their 30 second TV commercials for their Darkmilk chocolate bar campaign, set in a horticultural setting.

===Radio===
Wilde presented &quot;Secret Songs&quot; on Magic 105.4 every Sunday between 10am and 1pm. It later became &quot;The Request Show&quot;. In 2021, Wilde joined Ireland&#x27;s Classic Hits Radio, presenting &quot;The Kim Wilde 80&#x27;s Show&quot; which airs in the evenings, four days a week.

==Personal life==
On 1 September 1996, Wilde married her co-star in &quot;Tommy&quot;, Hal Fowler, and expressed a desire to have children as soon as possible. On 3 January 1998 she gave birth to Harry Tristan. On 13 January 2000, Rose Elisabeth was born. They announced their separation and subsequent divorce via a statement on Twitter on 21 December 2022.

<doc id="537324" wikidata="Q750019" url="?curid=537324" title="Aston Martin Vanquish">
<text>The Aston Martin Vanquish is a grand tourer introduced by British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin in 2001 as a successor to the Aston Martin Virage (1993).

The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, designed by Ian Callum and unveiled at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, was produced from 2001 to 2007 as the flagship of the marque. A concept car, known as &quot;Project Vantage&quot; and the first Aston Martin design wholly designed by Callum, was built to display the company&#x27;s vision for a future sports car that could represent Aston Martin&#x27;s aspirations after the discontinuation of the Virage-based Vantage. The concept car evolved directly into the V12 Vanquish, and featured an advanced carbon fibre and alloy structure, Aston Martin&#x27;s most powerful V12 engine, and host of new technologies. A specially modified V12 Vanquish was driven by James Bond in the 2002 film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. In 2004, a mildly updated version of the first-generation model named &quot;V12 Vanquish S&quot; was introduced featuring a more highly tuned engine and more track-oriented ride and handling. The V12 Vanquish was indirectly replaced by the DBS after 2007.

The second-generation &quot;Vanquish&quot; was introduced in 2012, this time based on Aston Martin&#x27;s existing VH platform – similar to the one that underpinned the DB9. Designed by Marek Reichman and made in the Gaydon facility, the VH platform Vanquish was designed to fill the shoes of the discontinued DBS. In 2017, a &quot;Vanquish S&quot; with a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics was launched. The second-generation Gaydon Vanquish was succeeded by the DBS Superleggera in 2018. In September 2024, Aston Martin announced the third-generation Vanquish as the successor of the DBS Superleggera.

== First generation (2001–2007)==

===V12 Vanquish (2001–2005)===
The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish was styled by Ian Callum and drew inspiration from the DB4 GT Zagato, projecting a more aggressive presence than Callum&#x27;s DB7 Vantage. The production car closely resembled the &quot;Project Vantage Concept&quot; which debuted with a V12 engine at the North American International Auto Show in January 1998. Underneath, the V12 Vanquish car featured a unique and bespoke bonded aluminium composite chassis with a carbon fibre backbone developed in partnership with Lotus, an advanced independent suspension, and a more highly tuned version of the naturally aspirated Aston Martin V12 engine that had debuted in the DB7 two years earlier. It was available in 2+0 and 2+2 seating configurations and came only in a coupé body style.

The naturally aspirated 60° DOHC 4 valves per cylinder V12 engine with a bore and stroke of produced at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. It is controlled by a drive-by-wire throttle and driven by a 6-speed automated manual transmission. The Vanquish model debuted with drilled and ventilated disc brakes with four-piston calipers, ABS, with electronic brake distribution. The interior featured full instrumentation, advanced electronics, and a choice of leather upholstery with metallic details – the latter was an intentional move away from the wood trim seen in the DB7.

As Aston Martin&#x27;s flagship car for the era, the V12 Vanquish was designed to deliver new performance benchmarks for the company. In addition to delivering impressive figures including an acceleration of in 4.5 seconds and a top speed of , the first-generation V12 Vanquish was generally very well received by the motoring press. Road tests included near-universal praise for its powertrain, chassis, advanced engineering, and design. The V12 Vanquish was described without caveat as &quot;The ultimate Grand Tourer&quot; by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; described the V12 Vanquish as &quot;worthy of the marque&#x27;s heritage and a serious alternative to the top Ferrari.&quot;

The V12 Vanquish series would become the last all-new model to be made in Aston Martin&#x27;s Newport Pagnell facility. While the traditional craft techniques had evolved somewhat from those used to make the previous generation of cars, primarily in the panel shaping, there was still a great deal of work done by hand in assembly and finishing as each car was very time-consuming to manufacture. As such, the Vanquish represents both the end of an era as the last model assembled at Newport Pagnell, and the beginning of another with its forward-looking engineering and performance.

Its appearance in the 2002 James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot; earned the V12 Vanquish the number three spot on the list of Best Film Cars Ever, behind the Minis from &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, and the DB5 from &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;Thunderball&quot;. In the movie, James Bond receives this car from Q for his mission to Iceland to see Gustav Graves&#x27; presentation of Icarus after being reinstated by M and would eventually use the car once more to chase Zao and rescue Jinx. The vehicle is equipped with a variety of gadgets which include machine guns and missiles on the grille, tire spikes for snow use, an ejector seat that enables the car to go back up, target seeking shotguns, as well as a cloaking device rendering the car invisible.

The V12 Vanquish is the only Aston Martin car loaded with gadgets in the Pierce Brosnan James Bond era as the franchise&#x27;s deal with BMW expired following &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. It is also the last gadget loaded modern day Aston Martin car to appear in the James Bond franchise until the Aston Martin DB10 which appeared in &quot;Spectre&quot;, though it was not loaded with much gadgets. The first two Bond films that starred Daniel Craig had an Aston Martin DBS which was not loaded with gadgets, though the one that appeared in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; had a compartment that carried Bond&#x27;s Walther P99 and a defibrillator. The V12 Vanquish also appears in video games namely &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;, &quot;Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2&quot;, &quot;James Bond 007: Nightfire&quot;, and &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;. In its appearance in &quot;Nightfire&quot;, the car is equipped with missiles, a smokescreen device, and could also transform into a submarine equipped with torpedoes. The V12 Vanquish was recognized, along with the DB4 GT Zagato, as one of the ten most beautiful cars of all time. The V12 Vanquish also appears in the 2003 &quot;The Italian Job&quot; remake where it is driven by the film&#x27;s main antagonist Steve Frazelli, portrayed by actor Edward Norton.

===V12 Vanquish S (2004–2007)===
The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish S debuted at the 2004 Paris Motor Show, with a number of subtle styling revisions. The engine displacement remained at , but power output increased from to . Torque also increased from to .

Visual changes included new wheels, a slightly different nose shape, a new raised boot lid with a larger integrated spoiler incorporating the third high-level brake light (in the rear window on the original Vanquish), a Vanquish S badge on the boot lid (the original Vanquish had no rear model designation), and the addition of a small front splitter. One result of these changes was a reduction in the drag coefficient from to . The V12 Vanquish S front and rear track measured and , respectively. A change in gear ratio enabled the car to reach a top speed of , and accelerate from in 4.2 seconds.

The V12 Vanquish S also incorporated the features of the optional Sports Dynamic Package (available for the Vanquish for the 2004 model year), which included stiffer suspension, revised steering, and larger brakes – front discs with six-piston calipers and rear discs with four-piston calipers. The V12 Vanquish S was sold for the 2005 model year alongside the original Vanquish, and 2006 onward as a stand-alone model. The 2007 model year V12 Vanquish was not sold in the United States.

=== Special editions and one-offs ===

==== Vanquish S Ultimate Edition ====
The end of the Vanquish&#x27;s production run was celebrated with the Vanquish S Ultimate Edition. Aston Martin announced that the last 50 cars built would have a new &#x27;Ultimate Black&#x27; exterior colour, upgraded interior, and personalised sill plaques.

==== Vanquish Zagato Roadster ====
The Vanquish Zagato Roadster is a right-hand drive, two-seat, open-top roadster initially shown by Zagato at the 2004 International Geneva Motor Show as a prototype and based on the V12 Vanquish. It was then displayed by Zagato at the 2004 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance where an American collector acquired the prototype. The car had to be flown back to Italy as it was only on temporary import papers before being properly imported to the US by a Massachusetts Aston Martin dealer as a &quot;show and display&quot; car. The car was offered at a Bonhams auction in Carmel in August 2015 at the Quail Lodge and Golf Club with an estimated price of US$700,000–850,000. The car had been driven 13,000 miles. The car&#x27;s VIN is SCFAC13391B50PP19.

==== Vanquish Bertone Jet 2 ====
The Vanquish Bertone Jet 2 is a 2-door shooting brake shown by Bertone also at the 2004 International Geneva Motor Show. The car gets its name from the 1960 Aston Martin DB4 GT Jet also built by Bertone. The car was originally shown in silver in 2004 and in gold in 2013 again at the International Geneva Motor Show at the reveal of the Aston Martin Rapide Bertone Jet 2+2. Designed by Giuliano Biasio.

==== Vanquish 25 by Ian Callum Design ====
In September 2019, Ian Callum Design (the company started by Ian Callum, the designer of the first generation Vanquish) publicly revealed the Vanquish 25. It is a restoration package for the first generation Vanquish to &quot;make the Vanquish the Grand Tourer for the 2020s&quot;. Only 25 cars will be made by British company R-Reforged. The 5.9-litre V12 has been tuned to now make an advertised a increase over a Vanquish S. The car can be had with the original six-speed, single-clutch Speedshift automated manual, a six-speed GM-sourced torque converter automatic, or a six-speed manual conversion already offered by Aston Martin Works.

===Technical specifications===

=== End of production ===
The production of the V12 Vanquish ended on 19 July 2007, coinciding with the closing of the company&#x27;s Newport Pagnell factory after 49 years of operation. Despite ongoing enthusiasm for the original V12 Vanquish and V12 Vanquish S, the hand made nature of their construction limited production to levels commensurate with earlier cars assembled at Newport Pagnell.

== Second generation (2012–2018)==
The second-generation Gaydon-built &quot;Vanquish&quot; (the &quot;V12&quot; part of the name was dropped for this generation of cars) started life as the Project AM310 Concept and was unveiled at the 2012 Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este held on the shores of Lake Como, Italy. The concept car was based on the latest generation of the VH platform that had debuted in the DB9, and then evolved into the V8 and V12 Vantage, DBS, Virage V12, and Rapide. It was internally known as project VH310. It included a tweaked version of Aston Martin&#x27;s familiar grille and headlight design and a more pronounced bulge in the bonnet – with One-77-inspired flourishes saved for the sides and the rear, the side vents run almost to the door handles (shared with the One-77), new rear light design shared with the One-77, and a 5.9-litre V12 engine that has a power output of . Aston Martin later announced that the concept would be put into production as the all-new Vanquish.

The Vanquish used an upgraded version of Aston Martin&#x27;s 5.9-litre V12 engine with a power output of at 6,750 rpm and torque of at 5,500 rpm. The Vanquish can accelerate from 0 to in 4.1 seconds, and has a top speed of . Like the DB9 and other VH platform Aston Martin automobiles, the engine is front-mounted with the transmission in the rear for better weight distribution. The Vanquish has 51/49 front/rear weight distribution, and a kerb weight of . It uses a fully catalysed stainless steel exhaust system with active bypass valves. The 2012–2014 cars use an updated ZF Touchtronic II six-speed automatic gearbox, which was then further replaced by an updated ZF Touchtronic III eight-speed automatic gearbox starting with the 2015 model year. It was the first Aston Martin model to be available with launch control. The combined space of cabin and a boot that, at 368 litres, is more than 60% larger than that of the DBS.

In 2013, Aston Martin unveiled a convertible variant of the Vanquish, called Volante. The Volante has a full carbon fibre body, triple-skin lightweight fabric roof, 50% larger boot than its predecessor and the third generation Brembo 398 mm × 36 mm (front) and 360 mm × 32 mm (rear) Carbon Ceramic Matrix (CCM) brake discs with six-piston front and four-piston rear brake callipers. The Vanquish Volante is 13% torsionally stiffer than the outgoing DBS Volante. On 16 November 2016, Aston Martin announced the new Vanquish S model. The Vanquish S features the &quot;AM29&quot; V12 engine, with power increased to , and a new aerodynamic package. The Vanquish S can accelerate from 0 to in 3.5 seconds with a top speed of . The car&#x27;s deliveries started in December 2016. Aston Martin also unveiled a convertible version of the Vanquish S called the Vanquish S Volante in 2017.

For the 2018 model year they also made a special and very limited edition of 12 Volante versions which was all hand made by the Q division with unique wheels and a special paint and options and badged it as TB12. This would be the last of the naturally aspired Aston Martin engines.

== Third generation (2024–present)==
On 2 September 2024, Aston Martin unveiled the third-generation Vanquish, powered by a new twin-turbo 5.2-litre V12, mated to an eight-speed ZF gearbox. The 5.2-litre V12 has been completely re-engineered from the original which debuted in the DB11 in 2016, featuring a new block, new heads, new intakes, new exhaust ports, and new turbos, making and of torque.

The car uses a modified version of the platform that underpins the DB12 and Vantage, having a longer wheelbase to accommodate the larger V12 engine. At , it is heavier than the DB12. The third-generation Vanquish accelerates from in 3.2 seconds, and has a top speed of . The third-generation Vanquish will be limited to under 1,000 units each year, with the first deliveries scheduled to begin toward the end of 2024.

==Vanquish Vision Concept==
The proposed third generation concept car was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. It features a rear mid-engine layout, aluminium bonded chassis and a new 3.0-litre V6 engine that can develop over . The production car would have been in the same market segment as the Ferrari F8 Tributo and McLaren 720S. The mid-engined Vanquish was originally planned to enter production in 2023, but was eventually cancelled.

<text>The Illyrian Provinces were an autonomous province of France during the First French Empire that existed under Napoleonic Rule from 1809 to 1814. The province encompassed large parts of modern Italy and Croatia, extending their reach further east through Slovenia, Montenegro, and Austria. Its capital was Ljubljana (). It encompassed six &quot;départements&quot;, making it a relatively large portion of territorial France at the time. Parts of Croatia were split up into Civil Croatia and Military Croatia, the former served as a residential space for French immigrants and Croatian inhabitants and the latter as a military base to check the Ottoman Empire.

In 1809, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the region with his Grande Armée after key wins during the War of the Fifth Coalition forced the Austrian Empire to cede parts of its territory. Integrating the land into France was Bonaparte&#x27;s way of controlling Austria&#x27;s access to the Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea and expanding his empire east. Bonaparte installed four governors to disseminate French bureaucracy, culture, and language. The most famous and influential governor was Auguste de Marmont, who undertook the bulk of Bonaparte&#x27;s bidding in the area. Marmont was succeeded by Henri Gatien Bertrand (1811–12), Jean-Andoche Junot (1812–13), and Joseph Fouché (1813–14).

Marmont pushed the Code Napoléon throughout the area and led a vast infrastructural expansion. During 1810, the French authorities established the &quot;Écoles centrales&quot; in Croatia and Slovenia. Although the respective states were allowed to speak and work in their native languages, French was designated as the official language and much of the federal administration was conducted as such. French rule contributed significantly to the provinces even after the Austrian Empire recovered the area in 1813-1814. Napoleon introduced a greater national self-confidence and awareness of freedoms, as well as numerous political reforms. He introduced equality before the law, compulsory military service for men, a uniform tax system, abolished certain tax privileges, introduced modern administration, separated church and state and nationalized the judiciary. French presence in this region saw to a diffusion of French culture and the creation of the Illyrian Movement.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Illyrian&quot; was probably suggested to Napoleon by Auguste de Marmont, who was influenced by the civic and revolutionary intelligentsia in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Carinthia, and wanted to use it to support the sense of commonality of the peoples living in the Provinces, which went beyond Napoleon&#x27;s basic geostrategic rationale to form the provinces, though historians have discussed the extents of the influence of historical ideas of Illyrism both in France and locally, as well as a Neoclassicist allusion to the ancient names of the Dalmatian coast, known as Illyria in antiquity and Illyricum during the Roman era.

==History==

The Slovene Lands, ruled by the Habsburg monarchy, were first occupied by the French Revolutionary Army after the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797, led by General Napoleon Bonaparte. The occupation caused huge civil disturbances. The French troops under the command of General Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte tried to calm the worried population by issuing special public notices that were published also in Slovene. During the withdrawal of the French army, the commanding general Bonaparte and his escort made a stop in Ljubljana on April 28, 1797. Upon the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz and the Peace of Pressburg, French troops once again occupied parts of Slovene territory. Supply of the French troops and steep war dues were a huge burden for the population of the occupied territories. The foundation of the provincial brigades in June 1808 and extensive preparations for the new war did not stop Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée, which completely defeated the Austrian troops at the Battle of Wagram on July 6, 1809.

After the Austrian defeat, the Illyrian Provinces were created by the Treaty of Schönbrunn on 14 October 1809, when the Austrian Empire ceded the territories of western (&quot;Upper&quot;) Carinthia with Lienz in the East Tyrol, Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, the Imperial Free City of Trieste, the March of Istria, and the Croatian lands southwest of the river Sava to the French Empire. These territories lying north and east of the Adriatic Sea were amalgamated with the former Venetian territories of Dalmatia and Istria, annexed by Austria in the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, and the former Republic of Ragusa, which all had just been adjudicated to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1805 and 1808, into the Illyrian Provinces, technically part of France.

The Royal Navy imposed a blockade of the Adriatic Sea after the signing of the Treaty of Tilsit (July 1807), which brought merchant shipping to a standstill, a measure which seriously affected the economy of the Dalmatian port cities. An attempt by joint Franco-Italian force to seize the British-held Dalmatian island of Vis (Lissa) failed on 22 October 1810.

In August 1813, the Austrian Empire again declared war on France. Austrian troops led by generals Christoph von Lattermann and Franz Tomassich invaded the Illyrian Provinces. Lattermann operated in northern parts, while Tomassich invaded Dalmatia. The strategic port of Trieste was taken on 29 October. Croat troops enrolled in the French army switched sides. Zara (now called Zadar) surrendered to Austrian and British forces after a 34-day siege on 6 December 1813. In the regions of Dubrovnik and Kotor local insurrections forced the French to retreat into the cities. Insurrection in the Bay of Kotor region was aided by Montenegrin forces. Arrival of British naval forces led to the siege of Kotor, forcing French garrison to surrender on 3 January 1814. In the region of Dubrovnik, a provisional Ragusan administration was established, hoping for the restoration of the Republic. After the Siege of Dubrovnik, the French garrison surrendered on 27 January 1814, thus effectively ending French rule in the Illyrian Provinces, while the Treaty of Paris (30 May 1814) formally reduced French territory to the 1792 borders. The appearance of Austrian forces in the Bay of Kotor region caused the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro to turn over the territory to Austrian administration on 11 June. The British withdrew from the Dalmatian islands as the final part of the handover of these islands to their Austrian allies in July 1815, following the conclusion of the Battle of Waterloo.

==Administration==
The capital was established at &quot;Laybach&quot;, i.e. Ljubljana in modern Slovenia. According to Napoleon&#x27;s Decree on the Organization of Illyria (&quot;Decret sur l&#x27;organisation de l&#x27;Illyrie&quot;), issued on April 15, 1811, the Central Government of the Illyrian Provinces (&quot;Gouvernement general des provinces d&#x27;Illyrie&quot;) in Ljubljana consisted of the governor-general (&quot;gouverneur-général&quot;), the general intendant of finance (&quot;intendant général des finances&quot;) and the commissioner of the judiciary (&quot;commissaire de justice&quot;). With two judges of the Appellate Court in Ljubljana they formed the Minor Council (&quot;Petit conseil&quot;) as the supreme judicial and administrative authority of the Provinces.

===Subdivision===
The area initially consisted of eleven departments, though the subdivision was never completely enacted: 

In 1811, the Illyrian provinces saw an administrative reorganization, when the country was divided initially in four – Laybach (Ljubljana), Karlstadt (Karlovac), Trieste (Trst), Zara (Zadar) – on 15 April in seven provinces (&quot;intendances&quot;, similar to French &quot;départements&quot;). Each province was further subdivided into districts, and these into cantons. A province (&quot;intendancy&quot;) was governed by a provincial intendant, districts were administered by subdelegates (each district capital that was not a province capital had a subdelegation with a subdelegate, similar to French subprefect) and in cantons justices of the peace had their seats. Municipalities – with municipal council, mayor and deputy mayors in larger municipalities; or council, municipality president-syndic and deputy president-deputy syndic – were units of local government. All officials and councillors were appointed by the emperor or the governor-general, depending on their relevance and/or size of the subdivision unit in which they served.

=== List of provinces ===
List of provinces (&quot;intendances&quot;) and districts:

Two Chambers of Commerce were established, at Trieste and at Ragusa. The ecclesiastical administration was reorganized in accordance with the new political borders; two archdioceses were established with seats at Ljubljana and Zara, with suffragan dioceses at Gorizia, Capodistria, Sebenico, Spalato and Ragusa (1811).

=== Governors-general ===
The French administration, headed by a governor-general, introduced civil law (the Napoleonic &quot;Code civil&quot;) across the provinces. The seat of the governor-general was at Laybach. The governors-general were:

*Auguste de Marmont (8 October 1809 – January 1811)
*Henri Gatien Bertrand (9 April 1811 – 21 February 1813)
*Jean-Andoche Junot (21 February 1813 – July 1813)
*Joseph Fouché (July 1813 – August 1813)

===Population===
The population (1811) was given at 460,116 for the intendancy of Ljubljana, 381,000 for the intendancy of Karlovac, 357,857 for the intendancy of Trieste and 305,285 for the intendancy of Zara, in total 1,504,258 for all of Illyria. A French decree emancipated the Jews; in effect the decree abolished a Habsburg regulation which had forbidden Jews to settle within Carniola.

===Political arrangements===
Despite the fact that not all French laws applied to the territory of the Illyrian Provinces, Illyrian offices were accountable to ministries in Paris and to the Higher Court of Paris. Inhabitants of the Illyrian Provinces had Illyrian nationality. Initially the official languages were French, Italian and German, but in 1811 Croatian and Slovenian were further added, the latter becoming official for the first time in history. Among the main changes the French empire brought were the overhaul of administration, the changing of the schooling system – creating universities and making Slovene a learning language – and the usage of the Napoleonic Code and the Penal Code. Although the French did not entirely abolish the feudal system, their rule familiarized in more detail the inhabitants of the Illyrian Provinces with the achievements of the French Revolution and with contemporary bourgeois society. They introduced equality before the law, compulsory military service and a uniform tax system, and also abolished certain tax privileges, introduced modern administration, separated powers between the state and the church (the introduction of the civil wedding, keeping civil registration of births etc.), and nationalized the judiciary. The occupants made all the citizens theoretically equal under the law for the first time.

The French also founded a university () in 1810 (which was disbanded in 1813, when Austria regained control, but whose Basic Decree of 4 July 1810, which ordered the reorganization of the former Austrian lycees in Ljubljana and Zara into , is now considered the charter of the University of Ljubljana). They established the first botanic garden at the city&#x27;s edge, redesigned the streets and made vaccination of children obligatory. At Karlovac, the headquarters of the Croatian military, a special French-language military school was established in 1811. The linguist Jernej Kopitar and the poet Valentin Vodnik succeeded in instructing the authorities at that time that the language of the inhabitants living in the present-day Slovenian part of the Illyrian Provinces was actually Slovene. Although at the time of the Illyrian Provinces the educational reform did not come to life to its fullest ability, it was nevertheless of considerable social significance. The plan for reorganisation of the school system provided for education in elementary and secondary schools in Slovene in Slovenian areas. There were 25 gymnasia in the Illyrian provinces.

Proclamations were published in the provinces&#x27; official newspaper, the &quot;Official Telegraph of the Illyrian Provinces&quot; (). The newspaper was established by Marmont. In 1813, the French author Charles Nodier worked in Ljubljana as the last editor of the journal, significantly renovated it, and published it in French, Italian, and German. The &quot;French gift&quot; of letting Slovene be used at school was one of the most important reforms and it won the sympathy of members of the so-called &quot;Slovene National Awakening Movement&quot;. Marmont&#x27;s school reform introduced, in the fall of 1810, a uniform four-year primary school and an extended network of lower and upper gymnasiums and crafts schools. Valentin Vodnik, author of the poem &quot;Illyria Arise&quot;, wrote numerous school books for primary schools and lower gymnasiums; since textbooks (and teachers) were scarce, these books made the realization of the idea of Slovene as a teaching language possible.

==Legacy==
Although French rule in the Illyrian Provinces was short-lived and did not enjoy great popular support, it significantly contributed to greater national self-confidence and awareness of freedoms, especially in the Slovene lands. The opinion of Napoleon&#x27;s rule and the Illyrian Provinces changed significantly at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when liberal Croatian and Slovene intellectuals began to praise the French for liberation from Austrian rule.

It could also be established today that the short period of the Illyrian Provinces marked the beginning of an enhanced awareness of the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity. The Congress of Vienna confirmed Austria in the possession of the former Illyrian Provinces. In 1816 they were reconstituted without Dalmatia and Croatia, yet now with all of Carinthia, as a Kingdom of Illyria, which was formally abolished only in 1849, even though the civil administration of the Croatian districts had already been placed under Hungarian administration in 1822.

The memory of the French and of the Emperor Napoleon is embedded in Croatian and Slovene traditions, in their folk art and folk songs. The presence of the French on Croatian and Slovene territories reflects also in the surnames and house names of French origin, in frescoes, and other paintings depicting French soldiers as well as in rich immovable cultural heritage (roads, bridges, fountains). In 1929, a national ceremony was held in Ljubljana during which a monument was erected to Napoleon and Illyria at French Revolution Square. It was filmed by Janko Ravnik.

One of the central streets in Split city centre is named after Marshal Marmont, in appreciation of his enlightened rule in Dalmatia.

<text>The Universities at Shady Grove (USG) is a multi-university higher education center of the University System of Maryland for mid-career working professionals and non-traditional students. Degrees taught by the cooperative are conferred by the individual universities as opposed to it being conferred in the name of the education center.

== History ==
It originally began in 1992 as part of the University of Maryland University College. In 2000, it reformed under its present name. Daytime, evening and weekend classes are offered at Shady Grove to students studying in 80 undergraduate, graduate, degree and certificate programs.

Established in 2000, The Universities at Shady Grove (USG) is a regional higher education center of the University System of Maryland that offers students access to undergraduate and graduate degree programs from nine universities on one campus in Rockville, Maryland.

There is no separate application for USG; prospective students seeking to enroll in a program at USG apply directly to the university offering their desired program. Students are taught by the same professors, take the same courses, and have the same curriculum as students enrolled in that program at their university&#x27;s main campus. Students take their classes at USG, but earn their degree from the university offering their program.

There is an on-campus library, the Shannon and Michael Priddy Library.

<doc id="537347" wikidata="Q3100060" url="?curid=537347" title="Matthew Sweet">
<text>Sidney Matthew Sweet (born October 6, 1964) is an American alternative rock/power pop singer-songwriter and musician who was part of the burgeoning music scene in Athens, Georgia, during the 1980s before gaining commercial success in the 1990s as a solo artist. His companion albums, &quot;Tomorrow Forever&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, were followed by 2018&#x27;s &quot;Wicked System of Things&quot; and 2021&#x27;s &quot;Catspaw&quot;, his 15th studio effort.

== Early life and education ==

Sweet was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. He graduated from Southeast High School in Lincoln, in 1983. Upon graduation he moved to Athens, Georgia to attend college.

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
As a high school student in 1980, Sweet wrote songs and recorded them on four-track cassettes. He joined the band The Specs and released his first recording on a battle of bands LP produced by a local radio station, and fronted his own local band called The Dialtones. After graduating, Sweet traveled to Athens, Georgia, to attend college during the vibrant Athens music scene. That same year, Sweet, who had met the band R.E.M. when they played a show in his hometown the previous year, collaborated with frontman Michael Stipe in a duo group under the name Community Trolls, as well as played guitar in Stipe&#x27;s sister Lynda Stipe&#x27;s band, Oh-OK. In addition, he formed another duo, The Buzz of Delight, with Oh-OK drummer David Pierce, releasing an EP, &quot;Sound Castles&quot;, in 1984 on DB Records. On the strength of this 12&quot; vinyl, Sweet was signed to a solo recording contract with Columbia Records.

In 1986, he released &quot;Inside&quot;, his debut album, to good reviews but little commercial success. In 1989, he released &quot;Earth&quot; after signing with A&amp;M Records; likewise, it was well-received critically, yet not commercially. This marked a personal and professional low period as his record company lost interest and his marriage failed.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, A&amp;M released Sweet from his contract, and he signed with rival Zoo Entertainment, which evolved into Volcano Entertainment. Sweet formed a new band (which included Richard Lloyd, Robert Quine, Greg Leisz, Lloyd Cole, and Fred Maher), and together they spent that year assembling his next work, originally titled &quot;Nothing Lasts&quot;.

The following year, Sweet released &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, which was widely considered an artistic breakthrough. It quickly garnered impressive U.S. sales, spawning a Top 10 single with the title track. The music video for &quot;Girlfriend&quot; (heavily aired on MTV, MuchMusic and &quot;Night Tracks&quot;) featured clips from the anime film &quot;Space Adventure Cobra&quot;, while the video for &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Waiting&quot; used clips of the &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; character Lum.

In 1993, Sweet released &quot;Altered Beast&quot;, an album which drew mixed reactions with its intense and brooding tracks (such as &quot;Someone to Pull the Trigger&quot; and &quot;Knowing People&quot;). The music video for the single &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot; (directed by Sweet) featured the singer being chased in the desert by police while driving his own 1970 Dodge Challenger, while the video for &quot;Time Capsule&quot; was a literary homage to Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels.&quot;

In 1995, Sweet released &quot;100% Fun&quot;, an alt-rock album best known for its lead-off track, the self-deprecating &quot;Sick of Myself&quot;. The album itself fared better commercially, and even made it onto &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic David Browne&#x27;s year&#x27;s-best list.

In 1997, Sweet released &quot;Blue Sky on Mars&quot;, a new-wave album which featured the synth-laden singles &quot;Where You Get Love&quot; and &quot;Come to California&quot;. The music video for the former featured Sweet as an astronaut traveling through outer space.

In 1998 his version of Walter Egan&#x27;s Magnet and Steel was recorded on the Sabrina The Teenage Witch album with Lindsey Buckingham on guitar.

In 1999, Sweet released &quot;In Reverse&quot;, a psychedelic album which featured Wall of Sound singles &quot;What Matters&quot; and &quot;Trade Places&quot;. The album is noteworthy for its 10-minute closing track, &quot;Thunderstorm&quot;, a combination of several demos.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Sweet released &quot;Time Capsule: Best of 90/00&quot;, a retrospective compilation which featured two new tracks.

In 2001, Sweet and Darius Rucker performed The Beach Boys song &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot; on the special &quot;A Tribute to Brian Wilson&quot;; the musicians later performed the same song with Brian Wilson himself on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In 2002, Sweet released &quot;To Understand: The Early Recordings of Matthew Sweet&quot;, a retrospective compilation which featured unreleased material. Also that year, he formed the group The Thorns with Shawn Mullins and Pete Droge.

In 2003, Sweet released &quot;Kimi Ga Suki&quot;, a garage-rock album initially released in Japan, where Sweet has a following.

In 2004, he released &quot;Living Things&quot;, an acoustic album mainly consisted of material he wrote while recording w/ The Thorns.

In 2006, Sweet and Susanna Hoffs released &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 1&quot;, which featured covers of popular 1960s songs.

In 2008, Sweet released &quot;Sunshine Lies,&quot; his 10th studio album, which also incorporated a 2-LP set featuring 4 bonus tracks.

In 2009, Sweet and Hoffs released &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 2&quot;, which featured covers of popular 1970s songs.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, the musical &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, using songs from Sweet&#x27;s album of the same name, was staged by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre.

In 2011, Sweet released &quot;Modern Art&quot;, an album which featured the single, &quot;She Walks the Night&quot;.

In 2012, Sweet celebrated the 20th anniversary of &quot;Girlfriend&quot; with a tour performing the entire album from start to finish. Also that year, Sweet contributed an essay for the Mark Dillon book &quot;Fifty Sides of the Beach Boys&quot; on the 1967 song &quot;Wonderful&quot;.

In 2013, Sweet and Susanna Hoffs released &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 3&quot;, which features covers of popular 1980s songs.

In 2014, Sweet was featured on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the longest-running American sitcom. He wrote &quot;Hopin&#x27; for a Dream&quot;, a song by fictitious 1980s band SunGazer, in the episode. Sweet and his wife Lisa were also research consultants for the Tim Burton film &quot;Big Eyes&quot;, a biography on painter Margaret Keane.

In 2015, Sweet and Susanna Hoffs released &quot;Completely Under the Covers&quot;, a limited 4-disc box set of all three &quot;Under the Covers&quot; albums, with 15 bonus tracks.

In 2017, Sweet released &quot;Tomorrow Forever&quot;, a rootsy album funded entirely by fans on Kickstarter; over the course of one month in 2014, the project exceeded its $32,000 goal by 75% from fewer than 800 backers.

In 2018, Sweet released &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Daughter&quot; on May 18, a companion album to &quot;Tomorrow Forever&quot;.

<doc id="537355" wikidata="Q5127324" url="?curid=537355" title="Clark Memorandum">
<text>The Clark Memorandum on the Monroe Doctrine or Clark Memorandum, written on December 17, 1928 by Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s undersecretary of state J. Reuben Clark, concerned the United States&#x27; use of military force to intervene in Latin American nations. This memorandum was a secret until it was officially released in 1930 by the Herbert Hoover administration. 

The Clark memorandum rejected the view that the Roosevelt Corollary was based on the Monroe Doctrine. However, it was not a complete repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary but was rather a statement that any intervention by the U.S. was not sanctioned by the Monroe Doctrine but rather was the right of America as a state. This separated the Roosevelt Corollary from the Monroe Doctrine by noting that the Monroe Doctrine only applied to situations involving European countries. One main point in the Clark Memorandum was to note that the Monroe Doctrine was based on conflicts of interest only between the United States and European nations, rather than between the United States and Latin American nations.

Historian Gene Sessions says the memorandum said the Monroe Doctrine did not explicitly renounce rights of intervention in Latin America (as often stated). It had little if any influence on the development evolution of US Latin American policy.

== Conditions and details ==
During the late 1920s, a number of American foreign policy leaders started to argue for a softer tone in US relations with Latin American nations, which had been chafing under decades of intervention by the United States. Under secretary of State, and later Ambassador to Mexico, J. Reuben Clark (1871–1961) held these conciliatory views and completed work on the 236-page Memorandum late in the Coolidge administration. Clark argued the following:
*Every nation, including the United States, has the right of &quot;self-preservation&quot;.
*The principle of self-preservation underlies the Monroe Doctrine.
*The United States alone makes the decision about when to intervene on behalf of Latin American nations.
*The Monroe Doctrine was not concerned with the relationship between the United States and other nations in the Americas, except when European interference in those nations threatened the security of the United States. 
*The Doctrine relates to the relationship of the United States and Latin America on one side versus Europe on the other side, not of the United States on one side versus Latin America on the other side. 
*The primary purpose of the Doctrine was to protect Latin American nations from intervention by European powers, not to victimize or oppress Latin American nations.
*The Roosevelt Corollary was not part of the Monroe Doctrine.
*The application of the Monroe Doctrine by the United States was beneficial to Latin American states.

While sometimes regarded as an outright repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary, Clark was simply advancing his belief that the corollary was separate from the Monroe Doctrine and that American intervention in Latin America, when necessary, was sanctioned by U.S. rights as a sovereign nation, not by the Monroe Doctrine. 

Clark&#x27;s views were not made public until March 1930 during the Hoover administration, when Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson was guiding American diplomacy toward the beginning of a Good Neighbor Policy with its Latin American neighbors.

The memorandum also used the term &quot;national security&quot; in its first known usage.

<text>Magic Kingdom Park is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. It opened on October 1, 1971, and is owned and operated by the Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division. The official park name has changed slightly over the years - from &quot;Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom&quot; (1971–1994) to &quot;The Magic Kingdom&quot; (1994–2017). The park was initialized by Walt Disney and designed by WED Enterprises. The park layout and attractions were based on Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and are dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters.

The park icon is Cinderella Castle, inspired by the fairy tale castle featured in the 1950 animated film. In 2023, the park hosted 17.72 million visitors, making it the most visited theme park in the world for the seventeenth consecutive year and the most visited theme park in North America for at least the past twenty-three years. The park has become a cultural touchstone and symbol of modern American pop culture.

==History==
===Conception===

Walt Disney was highly involved in planning the Walt Disney World resort complex and park, coming to Florida in person to survey the land, meeting with local officials and announcing the project to the media but not being able to see his vision come to life due to his death from cancer in 1966. After Walt&#x27;s death, his brother Roy Disney took over the project. Walt Disney Productions began construction on Magic Kingdom and the entire resort in 1967. The park was built as a larger, improved version of Disneyland in California.

Magic Kingdom was built over a series of tunnels called utilidors, a portmanteau of &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;corridor&quot;, allowing employees (called &quot;cast members&quot;) or VIP guests to move through the park out of sight.

Because of Florida&#x27;s high water table, the tunnels could not be put underground, so they were built at the existing grade, meaning the park is built on the second story, giving the Magic Kingdom an elevation of . The area around the utilidors was filled in with dirt removed from the Seven Seas Lagoon, which was being constructed at the same time. The utilidors were built in the initial construction and were not extended as the park expanded. The tunnels were intended to be designed into all subsequent Walt Disney World parks but were set aside mostly because of financial constraints.

===Opening and operation===
Magic Kingdom Park opened as the first part of the Walt Disney World Resort on October 1, 1971, commencing concurrently with Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort and Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Village Resort. It opened with twenty-three attractions, three unique to the park and twenty replicas of attractions at Disneyland, split into six themed lands, five copies of those at Disneyland (Main Street, U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland) and the Magic Kingdom exclusive of Liberty Square, rather than the Disneyland New Orleans Square. The Walt Disney Company promised to increase this number with a combination of replicas and unique attractions. While there is no individual dedication to Magic Kingdom, the dedication by Roy O. Disney for the entire resort was placed within its gates.

The only land added to the original roster of lands in the park was Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair. The land originally opened in 1988 as Mickey&#x27;s Birthdayland to celebrate Mickey Mouse&#x27;s 60th birthday. Later the land was renovated as Mickey&#x27;s Starland and eventually to Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair. The land was home to attractions such as Mickey&#x27;s Country House, Minnie&#x27;s Country House, The Barnstormer at Goofy&#x27;s Wiseacre Farm, and Donald&#x27;s Boat. It closed on February 12, 2011, to make way for the expansion of Fantasyland. The Walt Disney World Railroad station in Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair, which opened with Mickey&#x27;s Birthdayland in 1988, was closed for the duration of the construction. In 2012, the space where Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair sat reopened as a part of Fantasyland, in a sub-section called the Storybook Circus, where an updated Dumbo the Flying Elephant attraction was relocated. The Barnstormer was retained and was re-themed to The Great Goofini.

Since opening day, Magic Kingdom has been closed temporarily because of nine hurricanes: Floyd, Charley, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, Matthew, Irma, Ian, and Milton. The first non-hurricane related day the park has closed is on September 11, 2001, due to the terrorist attacks that day. Walt Disney World was closed from March 15, 2020, to July 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there are four &quot;phases&quot; of park closure when Magic Kingdom exceeds capacity, ranging from restricted access for most guests (Phase 1) to full closure for everyone, even cast-members (Phase 4).

&quot;Magic Kingdom&quot; was often used as an unofficial nickname for Disneyland before Walt Disney World was built. The official tagline for Disneyland is &quot;The Happiest Place On Earth&quot;, while the tagline for Magic Kingdom is &quot;The Most Magical Place On Earth&quot;.
Up until the early 1990s, Magic Kingdom was officially known as &quot;Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom&quot;, and was never printed without the Walt Disney World prefix. This purpose was to differentiate between the park and Disneyland in California. In 1994, to differentiate it from Disneyland, the park was officially renamed Magic Kingdom Park.

Alcoholic beverages had been prohibited from the park since its opening, but this policy has gradually changed. In 2012, the Be Our Guest Restaurant opened selling wine and beer for the first time. This was the only place in the park where alcohol was permitted until December 2014 when four additional restaurants began selling beer and wine including Cinderella&#x27;s Royal Table, Liberty Tree Tavern, Tony&#x27;s Town Square Restaurant, and the Jungle Navigation Co. Ltd. Skipper Canteen. And finally in 2018, the park officially became the second Magic Kingdom-style park to serve alcohol at all table service restaurants, after Disneyland Paris in 1993.

Early in 2024, a Disney executive confirmed that the park will expand with the addition of a land located &quot;beyond Big Thunder.&quot;

== Park layout and attractions ==
Magic Kingdom is divided into six themed &quot;lands.&quot; The center of the park in front of Cinderella Castle is designed like a wheel with a hub and spoke design. Pathways spoke out from the hub across the of the park and lead to these six lands. The Walt Disney World Railroad circles around the perimeter of the park.
=== Main Street, U.S.A. ===
Main Street, U.S.A. is modeled after an idealized early-20th century American town, inspired by Walt Disney&#x27;s hometown of Marceline, Missouri. Main Street features a train station, town square, movie theater, city hall, firehouse, restaurants, emporium, shops, arcades, and several varieties of horse-drawn and motor-powered vehicles. Guests enter the park underneath the main station of the Walt Disney World Railroad and into the town square. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is the park&#x27;s hub, anchored by Cinderella Castle and the &quot;Partners&quot; statue.

Symbolically, Main Street represents the park&#x27;s &quot;opening credits&quot;, where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain) at left or right, then view the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings&#x27; upper floors. Many windows bear the name of a fictional business, such as &quot;Seven Summits Expeditions, Frank G. Wells President&quot;, with each representing a tribute to significant people connected to the Disney company and the development of the Walt Disney World Resort. It features stylistic influences from around the country. Taking its inspiration from New England to Missouri, this design is most noticeable in the four corners in the middle of Main Street, where each of the four corner buildings represents a different architectural style. The second and third stories of all the buildings along Main Street are designed with forced perspective, and are actually shorter than the first stories. The musical soundtrack played at the entrance includes musical selections from the 1943 Broadway musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and the 1957 Broadway musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;. The Dapper Dans, a men&#x27;s a cappella singing group, typically perform throughout Main Street.

=== Adventureland ===
Adventureland represents the mystery of exploring exotic lands and features several attractions themed to resemble the remote landscapes of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific. Jungle Cruise is a comedic riverboat cruise attraction that travels along wild waterways from around the world. Pirates of the Caribbean is a dark ride depicting the exploits and plundering of a pirate siege on Caribbean island town featuring several characters from the subsequent eponymous film series. Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room is a Polynesian musical Audio-Animatronic show drawing from American tiki culture in the Sunshine pavilion. Swiss Family Treehouse is an interactive walk-through treehouse attraction based on the 1960 film, &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. The Magic Carpets of Aladdin is an aerial carousel-style ride based on the 1992 film, &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

=== Frontierland ===
Frontierland is a romanticized portrayal of the American frontier, particularly elements from the American Old West, including cowboys, Native Americans and Western saloons.

Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is a mine train roller coaster featuring a runaway mine train through mine shafts and canyons of the American Southwest. Tiana&#x27;s Bayou Adventure is a log flume ride inspired by the 2009 film, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;. Tom Sawyer Island is inspired by the literary characters and stories of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, featuring interactive trails and scenic outlooks. Surrounding Tom Sawyer Island is the Rivers of America, an artificial waterway based on the untamed rivers found across the United States, that flows through Frontierland and Liberty Square. Traversing through the Rivers of America is the Liberty Belle Riverboat, a steam-powered riverboat attraction themed to a 19th-century sternwheeler. Other attractions include the Country Bear Musical Jamboree.

=== Liberty Square ===
Liberty Square is inspired by a colonial American town set during the American Revolutionary War. The land contains recreations and replicas found in Philadelphia and Boston such as Independence Hall, the Liberty Tree, and the Liberty Bell. The Hall of Presidents is a film presentation and stage show themed to the American presidency and featuring all 46 individual American presidents in Audio-Animatronic form. Tucked away in a corner of Liberty Square is The Haunted Mansion, a dark ride omnimover attraction themed to a haunted New England manor. The &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; riverboat&#x27;s dock is located on the shores of Liberty Square.

=== Fantasyland ===
Fantasyland is themed to Disney&#x27;s animated fairy tale feature films. Depicted in a medieval-faire style, Fantasyland features multiple attractions featuring various Disney characters and stories, including Peter Pan&#x27;s Flight, It&#x27;s a Small World, Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic in Fantasyland Theatre, Mad Tea Party, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and Prince Charming Regal Carrousel.

Outside of the castle courtyard is Fantasyland Forest, featuring attractions based on other Disney princesses and heroines: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, is a mine cart roller coaster based on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;; The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure is a dark ride omnimover attraction based on &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;; Be Our Guest Restaurant is a themed restaurant with character dining themed to Beast&#x27;s castle in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;; Enchanted Tales with Belle, and Ariel&#x27;s Grotto.

==== Storybook Circus ====
Storybook Circus is a subsection of Fantasyland, themed to a traveling circus stopped along a railroad route just outside of Fantasyland Forest. The land&#x27;s marquee attractions include Dumbo the Flying Elephant, an aerial carousel-style ride based on the 1941 film &quot;Dumbo&quot;; The Barnstormer, a family roller coaster featuring Goofy as a daredevil stuntman; and Casey Jr. Splash &#x27;n&#x27; Soak Station.

Originally, Storybook Circus was the location of Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair (as the original 7th themed land), which closed permanently on February 11, 2011. Some elements of Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair were demolished, and others were re-themed to fit the circus concept. An expanded Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride was built, with an interactive queue, and a second Dumbo ride was built next to it, in order to increase capacity. The Barnstormer at Goofy&#x27;s Wiseacre Farm was re-themed to &quot;The Great Goofini&quot;. A big top area was built for meet-and-greets, called Pete&#x27;s Silly Sideshow. This attraction features Goofy as a stuntman, Daisy Duck as a fortune-teller, Donald Duck as a snake-charmer, Minnie Mouse as a magician, and Pluto as a special performer. Storybook Circus opened with a &quot;streetmosphere&quot; circus act called The Giggle Gang, which had a two-year run from 2012 until 2014.

=== Tomorrowland ===
Tomorrowland is themed to the concept of the future inspired by the optimism and scientific advancements of the Space Age and Atomic Age. Several attractions include Astro Orbiter, Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin, Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor, Tomorrowland Speedway, the PeopleMover, and Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress, except for Stitch&#x27;s Alien Encounter Character Greeting! as a meet and greet location. A pair of thrill ride roller coasters are located on the western edge of Tomorrowland: Space Mountain, themed to space exploration through the cosmos; and TRON Lightcycle / Run, based on the digital software world of the Grid from &quot;Tron.&quot;

==Upcoming attractions==
In August 2024, it was announced that the park will receive two attractions inspired by Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise in a redeveloped section of Frontierland, with construction scheduled to start in 2025. In addition, it was announced that the park will receive a land themed to Disney&#x27;s villains.

==Transportation and Ticket Center==
Magic Kingdom lies more than a mile away from its parking lot, on the opposite side of the man-made Seven Seas Lagoon. Upon arrival, guests are taken by the parking lot trams to the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), which sells admission into the parks and provides transportation connections throughout the resort complex. Guests using city buses, non-Disney hotel shuttles or ridesharing services are also dropped off at the TTC.

To travel between the TTC and the Magic Kingdom, guests have their choice of taking a ferry boat or the Walt Disney World Monorail System.

The three ferries are clad in different trim colors and are named for past Disney executives: the &quot;General Joe Potter&quot; (blue), the &quot;Richard F. Irvine&quot; (red) and the &quot;Admiral Joe Fowler&quot; (green). The main monorail loop has two tracks. The outer track is used by the Express Line with direct service between the TTC and Magic Kingdom, while the inner track is the Resort Line with additional stops at the Contemporary, Grand Floridian and Polynesian Village resorts. Epcot is also accessible from the TTC on a spur monorail line that was added upon that park&#x27;s opening in 1982.

The hotels in the Magic Kingdom Resort Area are connected to the park by walking paths, ferry boats, or the Walt Disney World Monorail System.

Disney-owned hotels in other resort areas have Disney Transport buses to the Magic Kingdom, but these do not serve the TTC. Instead, they operate from three bus loops directly adjacent to the park&#x27;s main gate.

==Television adaptation==
In 2012, Jon Favreau announced he was planning a film called &quot;Magic Kingdom&quot;. The film was described as &quot;&quot;Night at the Museum&quot; at Disneyland,&quot; meaning that the film would tell a story where all the characters at Disney come to life at night. Marc Abraham and Eric Newman of Strike Entertainment were scheduled to produce the film. Writer-producer Ronald D. Moore had previously written an original script for the project, which the studio eventually declined to use, stating that Favreau and a new screenwriter would develop a new script.

In 2021, it was announced as a new project, now developed as a television series for Disney+. Moore was brought back to develop the series which will see that the various lands in the Magic Kingdom are actually gateways to alternate worlds, thus setting up a shared universe. The first in the series will be &quot;The Society of Explorers and Adventurers (SEA)&quot;.

<text>Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near Orlando. It is owned and operated by the Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division. Based on a concept by Marty Sklar, Randy Bright, and Michael Eisner, the park opened on May 1, 1989, as the Disney–MGM Studios Theme Park, and was the third of four theme parks built at Walt Disney World. Spanning , the park is themed to an idealized version of Hollywood, California, and is dedicated to the imagined worlds from film, television, music, and theatre, drawing inspiration from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios was initially developed as both a theme park inspired by show business and an operating production studio, with active film and television production services, an animation facility branch, and a functioning backlot. Construction on the combined park and studio began in 1987, but was accelerated when the construction of the similarly themed Universal Studios Florida began a few miles away. To increase public interest and the variety of film representation within the park, Disney entered into a licensing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), from which the park&#x27;s original name was derived. The park&#x27;s production facilities were removed throughout the 2000s, and many of the park&#x27;s soundstages were retrofitted for newer attractions and guest use. The park&#x27;s current name took effect in 2008, with the removal of the MGM-branding throughout the park. In the 2010s, the park began to distance itself from the original studio backlot intention and entered a new direction of immersive theming and attraction development inspired by imagined worlds from Hollywood storytellers.

The park&#x27;s original landmark was the Earffel Tower, a faux water tower topped with Mickey Mouse ears. In 2001, the Sorcerer&#x27;s Hat—a stylized version of the magical hat from &quot;Fantasia&quot;—was erected in the park&#x27;s central hub and served as the icon until its removal in January 2015. The Earffel Tower was also removed the following year. The Hollywood Tower Hotel has since been the official icon, with the park&#x27;s replica of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre serving as the visual centerpiece. In 2023, the park hosted 10.3 million guests, ranking it the tenth most-visited theme park in the world.

== Dedication ==
== History ==
A team of Walt Disney Imagineers led by Marty Sklar and Randy Bright had been given the assignment to create two new pavilions for Epcot&#x27;s Future World section. The brainstorming sessions led to Wonders of Life and Great Movie Ride pavilions. The latter was to look like a soundstage backdrop, with a movie theater-style entrance in the middle and would have sat between the Land and Journey Into Imagination pavilions. When newly appointed CEO Michael Eisner saw the plans for the pavilion, he requested that, instead of placing the ride in an already existing park, it should be the anchor for a new park themed with Hollywood, entertainment, and show business.

In 1985, Disney and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) entered into a licensing contract that gave Disney worldwide rights to use the MGM brand and logo for what would become Disney–MGM Studios, which included working production facilities for films and television shows, a backlot, and a satellite animation studio for Walt Disney Feature Animation, which began operation prior to the park&#x27;s debut. In 1988, MGM/UA responded by filing a lawsuit that claimed Disney violated the agreement by operating a working movie and television studio at the resort. On May 1, 1989, the theme park opened adjacent to the production facilities, with MGM&#x27;s only affiliation being the original licensing agreement that allowed Disney to use MGM&#x27;s name and lion logo in marketing, and separate contracts that allowed specific MGM content to be used in the Great Movie Ride. On opening day, the only two operating attractions were the Studio Backlot Tour and the Great Movie Ride. Several months after park opening, the &quot;Streetmosphere&quot; improvisational troupe was added to the park. The Streetmosphere performers, now named the Citizens of Hollywood, are the longest-running attraction at the park.

Disney later filed a countersuit, claiming that MGM/UA and MGM Grand, Inc. had conspired to violate Disney&#x27;s worldwide rights to the MGM name in the theme park business and that MGM/UA would harm Disney&#x27;s reputation by building its own theme park at the MGM Grand hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. On October 23, 1992, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Curtis B. Rappe ruled that Disney had the right to continue using the Disney-MGM Studios name on film product produced at the Florida facility, and that MGM Grand had the right to build a Las Vegas theme park using the MGM name and logo as long as it did not share the same studio backlot theme as Disney&#x27;s property. The MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park opened in 1993 at the Las Vegas site and closed permanently in 2000. Disney was contractually prohibited from using the &quot;Disney-MGM Studios&quot; name in certain marketing contexts; in those instances, the park was called either &quot;The Disney Studios&quot; or &quot;Disney Studios Florida&quot;.
In the 1990s, as the park&#x27;s popularity and attendance grew, the park saw its first expansion in 1994, with the addition of Sunset Boulevard and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror attraction. The backlot&#x27;s New York streets were opened to guest access to relieve traffic and renamed as Streets of America. During that same decade, Walt Disney Feature Animation&#x27;s on-site satellite studio assisted in the production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;, with &quot;Mulan&quot; and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; being completed entirely at the park&#x27;s studio. In 2001, the Sorcerer&#x27;s Hat—a stylized version of the magical hat from &quot;Fantasia&quot;—was erected in front of the park&#x27;s Chinese Theater and began to serve as the park&#x27;s icon from then onwards, displacing the Earffel Tower in that role. In 2004, Disney shuttered the Florida animation unit. The backlot&#x27;s Residential Street was demolished to accommodate the new location for &quot;Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show&quot; in 2005. In 2007, Disney announced that Disney-MGM Studios would be rebranded as Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, effective January 7, 2008. That same year, the former Stage 1 soundstage became home to &quot;Toy Story&quot; Mania! and the surrounding area was rethemed as Pixar Place.

In the 2010s, Disney began phasing out the park&#x27;s &quot;studio-like&quot; attractions that headlined the park during its early years of operation. This included the closure of the park&#x27;s Studio Backlot Tour, American Idol Experience, and the Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow attractions in 2014. The following year, the Sorcerer&#x27;s Hat was removed and the original sightlines from Hollywood Boulevard to the park&#x27;s Chinese Theatre were restored. In March 2015, during an annual shareholders meeting, Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at another possible name change for the park due to the changes coming in the near future. However, the company denied the rumors of a name change in February 2018. The park continued to close more studio-themed attraction; in April 2016, the majority of Streets of America—including the backlot street facades, the &quot;Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show&quot;, the Earffel Tower, and the remaining backstage areas—was closed and demolished in preparation for &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge and &quot;Toy Story&quot; Land. In 2017, the Great Movie Ride closed as the final remaining opening-day attraction and was replaced by Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway.

The park was closed from March 16 to July 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida.

== Park layout and attractions ==

Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios is divided into seven themed areas inspired by romanticized iterations of either existing locations found in Hollywood and throughout Los Angeles, or imagined worlds from Hollywood-born stories. The park&#x27;s original layout featured a large Hidden Mickey, which was visible in aerial photographs of the park and on the park&#x27;s early guide maps, though construction and other park changes have eliminated much of this image.

=== Hollywood Boulevard ===
Hollywood Boulevard, inspired by the real street of the same name, serves as the park&#x27;s main entrance and operates in the same vein as Main Street, U.S.A. at Magic Kingdom. It is lined with themed streetscape facades and venues selling Disney merchandise and park services. Guests enter through the main entrance gate, which resembles the Pan-Pacific Auditorium. Near the park&#x27;s gate is a recreation of the Crossroads of the World tower. Live street entertainment and seasonal parades travel down the main street throughout the day. At the far end of Hollywood Boulevard stands an exact replica of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, which houses Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway, a dark ride themed to the world of Mickey Mouse animated shorts. Near the entrance of Animation Courtyard—resides The Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant, a themed replica of the original Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, California.

=== Echo Lake ===
Echo Lake, inspired by the similarly named neighborhood in Los Angeles, is designed to mimic the suburban &quot;California Crazy&quot; form of architecture from Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age and is anchored around the area&#x27;s namesake lake.

Echo Lake features two major attractions based on characters and films created by George Lucas and produced by Lucasfilm. Star Tours – The Adventures Continue is a 3-D motion simulator ride set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. The live-action &quot;Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!&quot; re-enacts various scenes from Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark, &quot;while illustrating how professional film stunts are performed in the open-air Epic Theater.

The Hyperion Theater houses &quot;For the First Time in Forever&quot;: A &quot;Frozen&quot; Sing-Along Celebration, a musical show based on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Frozen&quot;. Behind this building lies a subsection named Commissary Lane, that connects Hollywood Boulevard directly to Grand Avenue and bypasses Echo Lake altogether. In this area, resides two eateries: ABC Commissary, a quick-service restaurant themed to ABC television programs and the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant, a dinner theater with a retro-style theme featuring vintage car themed tables and a large movie screen featuring continuous clips of science-fiction films from the 1950s.

=== Grand Avenue ===

Grand Avenue is themed as a gentrified historic district inspired by the real location of the same name in downtown Los Angeles. The area is anchored by Muppet*Vision 3D, a 4D film attraction starring the Muppets from Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, that is presented at the Grand Arts Theatre within the avenue&#x27;s Grand Park, itself also inspired by the real park of the same name. Grand Avenue is also home to PizzeRizzo—a pizzeria owned by Rizzo the Rat—Mama Melrose&#x27;s Ristorante Italiano, and BaseLine Tap House, a modern California-styled pub. The main street of Grand Avenue leads into a recreation of a Figueroa Street Tunnel which connects Grand Avenue to the adjacent &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge.

Grand Avenue was originally planned in the 1980s as a themed area called Muppet Studios, following Disney&#x27;s intended acquisition of the Jim Henson Company. In addition to Muppet*Vision 3D, this area was to include a themed restaurant and a Muppet dark ride parody of The Great Movie Ride. The deal fell through after Henson&#x27;s death in 1990, and only Muppet*Vision 3D was developed.

The realized Muppet-themed section became a part of the park&#x27;s former Streets of America area, which encompassed several attractions, including an urban street amalgamation of New York City and San Francisco. The area&#x27;s namesake street facades were formerly the park&#x27;s working backlot set, which was originally a component of the park&#x27;s inaugural Studio Backlot Tour, and opened to pedestrian park traffic in the mid-1990s; this area closed on April 2, 2016 to accommodate the construction of Galaxy&#x27;s Edge. The Muppet-themed areas and a single remaining New York block of the Streets of America facades were repurposed into Muppets Courtyard, which served as a placeholder designation until Grand Avenue was completed in September 2017.

=== &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge ===
&quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge is set within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, at the Black Spire Outpost village on the remote frontier planet of Batuu. Attractions include &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Rise of the Resistance, a dark ride that places guests in a climactic battle between the First Order and the Resistance; and Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, a flying simulator attraction that allows guests to pilot the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; through a customized secret mission on behalf of Hondo Ohnaka and Chewbacca. Restaurants and shops include Oga&#x27;s Cantina, Savi&#x27;s Workshop, and the Droid Depot. The land opened in 2019, replacing the park&#x27;s Streets of America section. The area cost an estimated $1 billion.

=== Toy Story Land ===
&quot;Toy Story&quot; Land is inspired by Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; series. The area is themed to Andy&#x27;s backyard with three attractions, each hosted by characters from the series. The attractions include Toy Story Mania!, an interactive 4D attraction inspired by classic carnival midway games; Slinky Dog Dash, an outdoor roller coaster; and Alien Swirling Saucers, a Whip ride. The land opened on June 30, 2018.

Toy Story Mania! was originally a standalone attraction within Pixar Place, an area dedicated to films and characters created by Pixar, resembling the animation studio&#x27;s Emeryville, California campus. Pixar Place was also the home of Luxo Jr., a six-foot-tall audio-animatronic version of Pixar&#x27;s desk-lamp mascot. The moving character performed periodic shows throughout the day and evening across from Toy Story Midway Mania.

=== Animation Courtyard ===
Animation Courtyard is home to attractions based on films and characters owned by the Walt Disney Company. Its entrance is marked by a square &quot;studio arch&quot;. This section of the park originally was the starting point for the Studio Backlot Tour.

The former Magic of Disney Animation building hosts &quot;Star Wars&quot; Launch Bay, a &quot;Star Wars&quot; exhibit featuring behind-the-scenes props and character meet-and-greets with Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and BB-8. Mickey Avenue, a subsection of Animation Courtyard, is home to a walk-through exhibit, Walt Disney Presents, which explores the life and legacy of Walt Disney through photos, models, artifacts, and a short biographical film narrated by Julie Andrews in the Walt Disney Theater. The Courtyard section also hosts two live shows. &quot;Disney Junior Dance Party!&quot; entertains guests with characters from Disney Junior series.

=== Sunset Boulevard ===
Sunset Boulevard, inspired by the real thoroughfare of the same name, as well as the film of the same name, was the first expansion of the park, opening in July 1994. The focal point of Sunset Boulevard is the Hollywood Tower Hotel which houses &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror, a drop tower thrill ride themed to an abandoned hotel and inspired by Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Located nearby is Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, an indoor darkened roller coaster themed to the music of Aerosmith in G-Force Records Studio, with three inversions and a high-speed launch.

Sunset Boulevard has two outdoor amphitheaters, and one indoor theater. The covered Theater of the Stars hosts &quot;Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage&quot;, a stage show featuring highlights from the 1991 animated film. The larger open-air Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is the home of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot;, a nighttime show featuring Mickey Mouse and many other Disney characters in a story with fireworks, lasers and water effects.
The indoor Sunset Showcase hosts the under construction Disney Villains show expected to open in fall 2025. 

== Upcoming attractions ==
In August 2024, it was announced that the park will receive a land themed to Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; franchise, with construction scheduled to start in 2025.

== Live entertainment ==

Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios has featured numerous forms of in-park entertainment throughout its history. During its early years, the park featured the &quot;Star Today&quot; program, with a daily celebrity guest. The celebrity would often be featured in a motorcade along Hollywood Boulevard or would take part in a handprint ceremony at the Great Movie Ride&#x27;s entrance, or participate in an interview session.

At other times, Disney has imported characters and intellectual properties that were not part of its own original library of films and television shows. Some of these characters have included the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Ace Ventura, Pet Detective&quot;, and characters from the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series by author R. L. Stine. The &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; made appearances in the park during the first seasons of the television series but then vanished. Disney had ownership of the Power Rangers franchise through its purchase of Saban Entertainment until May 2010 when Saban purchased the franchise back and were regular members of the park&#x27;s cast of characters during that time. Live musical acts, such as the cover band Mulch, Sweat and Shears and the a cappella quartet Four For a Dollar, used to perform on the park streets or as pre-show entertainment at the larger shows.

Like Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios also used to run daily parades down Hollywood Boulevard. The Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade and the Pixar Block Party Bash featured film characters performing in a street party along Hollywood Boulevard and near Echo Lake. Several times each day, the &quot;&quot;High School Musical 3 Senior Year&quot;: Right Here Right Now&quot; show used to travel Hollywood Boulevard before performing a live street show in front of the Sorcerer&#x27;s Hat.

Streetmosphere performers have been present at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios since 1989. They are the only opening day attraction left in the park. The improv troupe was originally called Streetmosphere, but later renamed to the Citizens of Hollywood. They perform magic, skits, and interact with guests multiple times a day on Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood Boulevard.

== Annual events ==

Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios has hosted several events during the years that often draw thousands of fans to the park.
*ESPN The Weekend (late winter) featured commentators from the Disney-owned cable sports channels as well as sports celebrities. The event was started in 2004 and permanently cancelled in July 2011.
*&quot;Star Wars&quot; Weekends (May–June) brought &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans and celebrities together for special park events. Running Fridays-Sundays throughout June, they featured the 501st Legion (a worldwide &quot;Star Wars&quot; costuming group) parading through the park in costumes that include Stormtroopers, TIE fighter pilots, biker scouts and Rebel soldiers. Several &quot;Star Wars&quot; actors appear each weekend for photos and autographs, appearing in a variety of shows hosted in the various theatres around the park, larger Jedi Training Academy classes for younger guests, and other activities. &quot;Star Wars&quot; Weekends ended its run in 2015.
*ABC Super Soap Weekend was scheduled in November, the event paid tribute to the legions of fans of soap operas from ABC. Guests could meet stars from &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. The event&#x27;s final presentation was in November 2008, with ABC instead planning to schedule multiple, smaller regional events around the country for its fans.
*The Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights (November–January) took over the Streets of America during the Christmas season. The display featured over five million Christmas lights on more than of wire. The event ended its run in 2015 preceding the demolition of Streets of America.
*Disney Jollywood Nights: A separate-admission seasonal Christmas event introduced in 2023, hosted on select evenings from 7:30 pm to 12:30 am in November and December.

== Production history ==
The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s original concept of the Disney-MGM Studios was to operate it as a television and motion picture production facility, as well as a theme park. In 1988, among the first feature-length movies filmed at the facility, prior to its completion and opening as a theme park, were &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot; and &quot;Newsies&quot;.

When the park opened in 1989, the studio/production facilities housed two major components, the first of which was Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, where Disney produced projects including &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, and sequences from other 1990s-early 2000s Disney animated features. The second, larger component was Walt Disney Studios Florida, which consisted of three sound stages used for Disney projects including The Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, &quot;Teen Win, Lose or Draw&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Several third party productions also used the Studios, including &quot;Superboy&quot; (first season only, from 1988–1989), the 1988–89 season of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Remote Control&quot;, &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot;, a revival of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, special broadcasts of &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; airplane interior sequences for the feature film &quot;Passenger 57, and The Dooley and Pals Show.&quot; Music videos, several tapings for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and live broadcasts of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; were also shot there; see WCW Disney tapings. The Post Group had a Florida-based post-production facility located on the Studio lot throughout the 1990s. All these production and post-production facilities were constructed to be an integral part of the theme park&#x27;s Backstage Studio Tour as well.

In 2004, Disney management (including CEO Michael Eisner) downsized Disney&#x27;s Florida operations by closing the animation studio, laying off personnel and then moving the operations to the main animation studio in Burbank, California. A radio studio is also located on the lot, behind &quot;Sounds Dangerous&quot;.

<text>The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) is an art gallery in London that houses a collection of portraits of historically important and famous British people. When it opened in 1856, it was arguably the first national public gallery in the world that was dedicated to portraits.

The gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin&#x27;s Place, off Trafalgar Square, and adjoining the National Gallery. The National Portrait Gallery also has regional outposts at Beningbrough Hall in Yorkshire and Montacute House in Somerset. It is unconnected to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, with which its remit overlaps. The gallery is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

==Collection==

The gallery houses portraits of historically important and famous British people, selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and caricatures as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture. One of its best-known images is the Chandos portrait, the most famous portrait of William Shakespeare although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.

Not all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds and other British artists of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the Somerset House Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the anamorphic portrait of Edward VI by William Scrots, Patrick Branwell Brontë&#x27;s painting of his sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne, or a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. In addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing selection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual BP Portrait Prize competition.

==History and buildings==

The three people largely responsible for the founding of the National Portrait Gallery are commemorated with busts over the former main entrance on St Martin&#x27;s Place. At the centre is Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope, with his supporters on either side, Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay (to Stanhope&#x27;s left) and Thomas Carlyle (to Stanhope&#x27;s right). It was Stanhope who, in 1846 as a Member of Parliament (MP), first proposed the idea of a National Portrait Gallery. It was not until his third attempt, in 1856, this time from the House of Lords, that the proposal was accepted. With Queen Victoria&#x27;s approval, the House of Commons set aside a sum of £2000 to establish the gallery. As well as Stanhope and Macaulay, the founder trustees included Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Ellesmere. It was the latter who donated the Chandos portrait to the nation as the gallery&#x27;s first portrait. Carlyle became a trustee after the death of Ellesmere in 1857.

For the first 40 years, the gallery was housed in various locations in London. The first 13 years were spent at 29 Great George Street, Westminster. There, the collection increased in size from 57 to 208 items, and the number of visitors from 5,300 to 34,500. In 1869, the collection moved to Exhibition Road and buildings managed by the Royal Horticultural Society. Following a fire in those buildings, the collection was moved in 1885, this time to the Bethnal Green Museum. This location was ultimately unsuitable due to its distance from the West End, condensation and lack of waterproofing. Following calls for a new location to be found, the government accepted an offer of funds from the philanthropist William Henry Alexander. Alexander donated £60,000 followed by another £20,000, and also chose the architect, Ewan Christian. The government provided the new site on St Martin&#x27;s Place, adjacent to the National Gallery, and £16,000. The buildings, faced in Portland stone, were constructed by Shillitoe &amp; Son. Both the architect, Ewan Christian, and the gallery&#x27;s first director, George Scharf, died shortly before the new building was completed. The gallery opened at its new location on 4 April 1896. The first extension, in 1933, was funded by Lord Duveen, and resulted in the wing by the architect Sir Richard Allison on a site previously occupied by St George&#x27;s Barracks running along Orange Street.

In February 1909, a murder–suicide took place in a gallery known as the &quot;Arctic Room&quot;. In an apparently planned attack, John Tempest Dawson, aged 70, shot his 58-year-old wife, Nannie Caskie, from behind with a revolver, then shot himself in the mouth, dying instantly. His wife died in hospital several hours later. Both were American nationals who had lived in Hove for around 10 years. Evidence at the inquest suggested that Dawson, a wealthy and well-travelled man, was suffering from a persecutory delusion. The incident came to public attention in 2010 when the Gallery&#x27;s archive was put on-line as this included a personal account of the event by James Donald Milner, then the Assistant Director of the Gallery.

The collections of the National Portrait Gallery were stored at Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire during the Second World War, along with pieces from the Royal Collection and paintings from Speaker&#x27;s House in the Palace of Westminster.

===Early 21st century===
The second extension was funded by Sir Christopher Ondaatje and a £12m Heritage Lottery Fund grant, and was designed by the London-based architects Edward Jones and Jeremy Dixon. The Ondaatje Wing opened in 2000 and occupies a narrow space of land between the two 19th-century buildings of the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, and is notable for its immense, two-storey escalator which takes visitors to the earliest part of the collection, the Tudor portraits.

In January 2008, the Gallery received its largest single donation to date, a £5m gift from the US billionaire Randy Lerner.

In January 2012, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, announced the National Portrait Gallery as one of her official patronages. Her portrait was unveiled in January 2013. The gallery holds nearly 20 portraits of Harriet Martineau and her brother James Martineau, whose great-nephew Francis Martineau Lupton was the Duchess&#x27;s great-great-grandfather.

Bodelwyddan Castle&#x27;s partnership with the National Portrait Gallery came to an end in 2017 after its funding was cut by Denbighshire County Council.

In June 2017 it was announced that the NPG has been awarded funding of £9.4 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards its major transformation programme &quot;Inspiring People&quot;, the Gallery&#x27;s biggest ever development. The Gallery had already raised over £7m of its £35.5m target. The building works were scheduled to start in 2020.

In October 2019, a group of semi-naked environmental campaigners were drenched in fake oil, in the Ondaatje Wing main hall, as part of a protest against BP&#x27;s sponsorship of a collection of pieces in the gallery. The protest performance piece, which was entitled Crude Truth, involve a clothed protester reciting a monologue in which they called upon arts organisations to sever ties with companies &quot;funding extinction&quot;. Three activists covered in black liquid lay down for about five minutes on a plastic sheet before standing up again, wiping themselves down with towels, and cleaning up after themselves. The action, which was applauded by onlookers, passed uninterrupted.

===Closure and refurbishment in 2020–2023===

A major programme of refurbishment with the project name of &quot;Inspiring People&quot; led to the gallery&#x27;s closure from 2020 to 2023. Some galleries closed by late May 2020, with full closure by July 2020. There were a number of planned exhibitions and collaborations around the UK to display parts of the collection while the gallery was closed. These included exhibitions starting at the York Art Gallery in 2021, the Holburne Museum, Bath (Tudor portraits, 2022), and museums in Liverpool, Newcastle, Coventry and Edinburgh, which later toured to other venues. Other partners included the National Trust, the National Maritime Museum and the National Gallery. In London, the shops and restaurants closed, but the Heinz Archive and Library remained open. Another programme, called &quot;Coming Home&quot;, loaned portraits of individual people to museums in their home towns. Exhibitions also travelled to Japan, Australia and the United States.

The &quot;Inspiring People&quot; project &quot;comprises a comprehensive redisplay of the Collection from the Tudors to now, combined with a complete refurbishment of the building, the creation of new public spaces, a more welcoming visitor entrance and public forecourt, and a new state of the art Learning Centre&quot;. The East Wing returned to being gallery space, with its own new street entrance.

The refurbishment cost £41 million, was designed by the architect Jamie Fobert and Purcell and the main contractor was Gilbert-Ash. It added new galleries, learning spaces, restaurants and a public forecourt. The gallery&#x27;s main entrance was moved and features three new bronze doors which carry 45 portraits of un-named women, drawn by Tracey Emin.

In 2022, the Gallery accepted a £10 million gift from the Blavatnik Family Foundation, established by U.S.-U.K. entrepreneur Sir Leonard Blavatnik. The new Blavatnik Wing on the Gallery’s first floor contains nine galleries hosting more than one hundred years of British portraits and is part of the Inspiring People project. The Gallery said the gift was the most significant in its history.

The gallery was reopened by the Princess of Wales on 20 June 2023 and she met Sir Paul McCartney whose photography exhibition was the first major show in the new space and viewed the Portrait of Omai by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which the gallery had just acquired jointly with the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, for £50 million. The gallery reopened to the public on 22 June. In 2024 the Inspiring People project was short-listed for the RIBA Stirling prize.

==Exterior busts==
In addition to the busts of the three founders of the gallery over the entrance, the exterior of two of the original 1896 buildings are decorated with stone busts of eminent portrait artists, biographical writers and historians. These busts, sculpted by Frederick R. Thomas, portray James Granger, William Faithorne, Edmund Lodge, Thomas Fuller, The Earl of Clarendon, Horace Walpole, Hans Holbein the Younger, Sir Anthony van Dyck, Sir Peter Lely, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Louis François Roubiliac, William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Thomas Lawrence and Sir Francis Chantrey.

==Finances and staff==
The National Portrait Gallery is an executive non-departmental public body of the UK Government, sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.

The National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s total income in 2007–2008 amounted to £16,610,000, the majority of which came from government grant-in-aid (£7,038,000) and donations (£4,117,000). As of 31 March 2008, its net assets amounted to £69,251,000. In 2008, the NPG had 218 full-time equivalent employees. It is an exempt charity under English law.

== Legal threat against Wikipedia volunteer ==

On 14 July 2009, the National Portrait Gallery sent a demand letter alleging breach of copyright against an editor-user of Wikipedia, who downloaded thousands of high-resolution reproductions of public domain paintings from the NPG website, and placed them on Wikipedia&#x27;s sister media repository site, Wikimedia Commons. The gallery&#x27;s position was that it held copyright in the digital images uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, and that it had made a significant financial investment in creating these digital reproductions. Whereas single-file low resolution images were already available on its website, the images added to Wikimedia Commons were re-integrated from separate files after the user &quot;found a way to get around their software and download high-resolution images without permission.&quot;

In 2012, the Gallery licensed 53,000 low-resolution images under a Creative Commons licence, making them available free of charge for non-commercial use. A further 87,000 high-resolution images are available for academic use under the gallery&#x27;s own licence that invites donations in return; previously, the gallery charged for high-resolution images.

, 100,000 images, around a third of the Gallery&#x27;s collection, had been digitised.

<doc id="537403" wikidata="Q3090544" url="?curid=537403" title="Paul Frees">
<text>Solomon Hersh Frees (June 22, 1920November 2, 1986), better known as Paul Frees, was an American actor, comedian, impressionist, and vaudevillian. He is known for his work on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Walter Lantz, Rankin/Bass and Walt Disney theatrical cartoons during the Golden Age of Animation, and for providing the voice of Boris Badenov in &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;. Frees was known as &quot;The Man of a Thousand Voices&quot;, though the appellation was more commonly bestowed on Mel Blanc.

==Early life==
Solomon Hersh Frees was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, on June 22, 1920. He grew up in the Albany Park neighborhood and attended Von Steuben Junior High School.

==Career==
In the 1930s, Frees first appeared in vaudeville as an impressionist, under the name Buddy Green. He began his career on radio in 1942 and remained active for more than 40 years. During that time, he was involved in more than 250 films, cartoons, and TV appearances; as was the case for many voice actors of the time, his appearances were often uncredited.

Frees&#x27;s early radio career was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Army during World War II, where he fought at Normandy, France, on D-Day. He was wounded in action and was returned to the United States for a year of recuperation. He attended the Chouinard Art Institute under the G.I. Bill. When his first wife&#x27;s health failed, he decided to drop out and return to radio work.

He appeared frequently on Hollywood radio series, including &quot;Escape&quot;, playing lead roles and alternating with William Conrad as the opening announcer. He announced the dramatic signature on &quot;Suspense&quot; in the late 1940s, and parts on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (filling in for Howard McNear as Doc Adams in the episode &quot;The Cast&quot;), and &quot;Crime Classics&quot;. One of his few starring roles in this medium was as Jethro Dumont/Green Lama in the 1949 series &quot;The Green Lama&quot;, as well as a syndicated anthology series &quot;The Player&quot;, in which Frees narrated and played all the parts.

In movies, he often did dubbing for live-action films. Examples include &quot;Midway&quot;, dubbing Toshiro Mifune&#x27;s performances as Admiral Yamamoto; and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, in which Frees provides the voice of funeral director Mozzarella as well as much of the falsetto voice for Tony Curtis&#x27; female character Josephine. Frees dubbed the entire role of Eddie in the Disney film &quot;The Ugly Dachshund&quot;, replacing actor Dick Wessel, who had died of a sudden heart attack after completion of principal photography. Frees also dubbed some of Humphrey Bogart’s lines in his final film &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;. Bogart was suffering at the time from what was later diagnosed as esophageal cancer, thus could barely be heard in some takes, hence the need for Frees to dub in his voice.

Unlike many voice actors who did most of their work for one studio, Frees worked extensively with at least nine of the major animation production companies of the 20th century: Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros. Cartoons, Walter Lantz Productions, UPA, Hanna-Barbera Productions, Filmation, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, Jay Ward Productions, Rankin/Bass, and Ruby-Spears.

===Disney===
Some of Frees&#x27; most memorable voices were for various Disney projects. Frees voiced Disney&#x27;s Professor Ludwig Von Drake in 18 episodes of the Disney anthology television series, beginning with the first episode of the newly renamed &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; on September 24, 1961. The character also appeared on many Disneyland Records. Von Drake&#x27;s introductory cartoon, &quot;An Adventure in Color&quot;, featured &quot;The Spectrum Song&quot;, sung by Frees as Von Drake. A different Frees recording of this song appeared on a children&#x27;s record, and was later reissued on CD.

In addition to voicing characters, Frees narrated a number of Disney cartoons, including the Disney educational short film &quot;Donald in Mathmagic Land&quot;. This short originally aired in the same television episode as Von Drake&#x27;s first appearance.

Frees also provided voices for numerous characters at Disney parks. He voiced the unseen &quot;Ghost Host&quot; at Haunted Mansion Attraction at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
For the Pirates of the Caribbean, Frees recorded the ghost voice saying the iconic &quot;dead men tell no tales&quot; used in the ride, as well as lending his voice to several audio-animatronic characters, including the Auctioneer, Magistrate Carlos, and the &quot;Pooped Pirate&quot; in the ride. Disney eventually issued limited edition compact discs commemorating The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, featuring some outtakes and unused audio tracks by Frees and others. Frees also provided narration for the Tomorrowland attraction Adventure Thru Inner Space (1967–1985, later replaced by Star Tours) and the original Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. Audio clips from the attractions in Frees&#x27;s distinctive voice have been included in fireworks shows at Disneyland.

An animated singing bust in Frees&#x27;s likeness appeared in the 2003 film &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; as a tribute. Similarly, audio recordings of Frees from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction can be heard in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; in an homage to the ride.

Frees also had a small on-camera role for Disney in the 1959 film &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, playing Dr. Galvin, a police psychiatrist who attempts to understand why Mr. Daniels believes a shaggy dog can uncover a spy ring. He also spoke the film&#x27;s opening narration.

His other Disney credits, most of them narration for segments of the Disney anthology television series, include:

* The &quot;Man in Space&quot; series of shows (TV, 1954)
* &quot;From Aesop to Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (TV, 1955)
* &quot;Mars and Beyond&quot; (film, 1957)
* &quot;The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca&quot; (TV miniseries, 1958)
* &quot;Tales of Texas John Slaughter&quot; (TV miniseries, 1958)
* &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (film, 1961)
* &quot;Moochie of Pop Warner Football&quot; (TV, 1960)
* &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; (film, 1965)

For his contributions to the Disney legacy, Frees was honored posthumously as a Disney Legend on October 9, 2006.

===Jay Ward Productions===
Frees was a regular presence in Jay Ward cartoons, providing the voices of Boris Badenov (from &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;), Inspector Fenwick (from &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot;, impersonating Eric Blore), Ape (impersonating Ronald Colman), District Commissioner Alistair and Weevil Plumtree in &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, Baron Otto Matic in &quot;Tom Slick&quot;, Fred in &quot;Super Chicken&quot;, and the &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot; narrator, among numerous others.

===Rankin/Bass===
Frees is well-remembered for providing the voices for many characters in Rankin/Bass cartoons and stop-motion animated TV specials, most notably for a number of holiday-themed specials. In 1968, he appeared as Captain Jones in the Thanksgiving special &quot;The Mouse on the Mayflower&quot;, and that Christmas he appeared as the father of the Drummer Boy, Ali, and as the three Wise Men in &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;. He was also Hocus Pocus, the traffic cop, the ticket-taker, and Santa Claus in &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; in 1969 and played the central villain, Burgermeister Meisterburger, and his assistant Grimsley in &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; in 1970. He provided several voices, including Aeon the Terrible, for &quot;Rudolph&#x27;s Shiny New Year&quot; in 1976.

Frees also voiced King Haggard&#x27;s wizard Mabruk and the Cat in &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; and provided several voices for the Jackson Five cartoon series between 1971 and 1973. He provided the voices for several J. R. R. Tolkien characters (most notably the dwarf Bombur) in Rankin/Bass animated versions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

===George Pal===
Frees portrayed the Orson Welles sound-alike radio reporter in George Pal&#x27;s film &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), where he is seen dictating into a tape recorder as the military prepares the atomic bomb for use against the invading Martians. Memorably, his character says the recording is being made &quot;for future history... if any&quot;. Frees also provided the film&#x27;s dramatic opening narration, prior to Sir Cedric Hardwicke&#x27;s voice-over tour of the solar system.

Frees subsequently provided the apocalyptic voice for the &quot;talking rings&quot; in Pal&#x27;s later film &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960), in which he explains the ultimate fate of humanity from which the time traveler realizes the origin of the Morlocks and Eloi.

Producer Pal later put Frees to work again in his fantasy film &quot;Atlantis, the Lost Continent&quot; (also 1960) and doing the opening voice-over narration for Pal&#x27;s &quot;Doc Savage&quot; (1975) film.

Frees did the narration for the George Pal documentary &quot;The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal&quot; (1985), written, produced, and directed by Arnold Leibovit. Two years later, Frees provided the voice for Arnie the Dinosaur and the Pillsbury Doughboy in &quot;The Puppetoon Movie&quot; (1987), also produced and directed by Leibovit.

===Other voice work===
The versatile actor voiced several characters, including three of the main characters in the US versions of Belvision&#x27;s &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot; cartoons, based on the books by Hergé.

He had also done work for Hanna-Barbera in their Tom and Jerry shorts at MGM. In the 1956 Cinemascope Tom and Jerry cartoon, &quot;Blue Cat Blues&quot;, he was Jerry&#x27;s voice who narrated the short; he voiced Jerry&#x27;s cousin Muscles in &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Cousin&quot; five years earlier and the cannibals in &quot;His Mouse Friday&quot; where he said the lines &quot;Mmmmm, barbecued cat!&quot; and &quot;Mmmmm, barbecued mouse!&quot;

At the MGM Animation studio, he also did multiple voice roles for Tex Avery&#x27;s short films, notably playing every role in &quot;Cellbound&quot; in 1955.

Frees worked with Spike Jones on his 1960 album &quot;Omnibust&quot;, heard as announcer &quot;Billy Playtex&quot; and several other characters on &quot;The Late Late Late Late Movies, Part I and II&quot;.

From October 1961 through September 1962, Paul Frees provided the voice for the shady lawyer named Judge Oliver Wendell Clutch, a weasel on the animated program &quot;Calvin and the Colonel&quot; starring the voices of Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll. The series was an animated television remake of their radio series &quot;Amos &#x27;n Andy&quot;.

For the 1962 Christmas special &quot;Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, produced by UPA, Paul Frees voiced several characters, including Fezziwig, the Charity Man, and two of the opportunists who steal from the dead Scrooge (Eyepatch Man and Tall Tophat Man) and Mister Magoo&#x27;s Broadway theatre director. He subsequently provided numerous voices for the follow up series &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;.

Frees provided the voices of both John Lennon and George Harrison in the 1965 &quot;The Beatles&quot; cartoon series, the narrator, Big D and Fluid Man in the 1966 cartoon series, &quot;Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles&quot;, and The Thing in the 1967 series &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, as well as President James Norcross in the 1967 cartoon series &quot;Super President&quot;. He played several rolesnarrator, Chef of State, the judges and the bailiffin the George Lucas / John Korty animated film, &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;.

Frees provided the voice-over for the trailer to the 1971 Clint Eastwood thriller, &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;.

In television commercials, he was the voice of the Pillsbury Doughboy, the 7-Up bird Fresh-Up Freddie, Froot Loops spokesbird Toucan Sam (previously voiced by Mel Blanc, later voiced by Maurice LaMarche), Boo-Berry in the series of monster cereal commercials, and The Farmer who helps The Little Green Sprout, (voiced by Ike Eisenmann), who called out to the Jolly Green Giant, &quot;So what&#x27;s new besides ho-ho-ho, Green Giant?&quot; He also played a British detective in a 1971 non-animated television commercial for Taster&#x27;s Choice coffee.

Frees narrated many live action films and television series, including &quot;Naked City&quot; (1958–1963). Frees also provided the voice of the eccentric billionaire John Beresford Tipton, always seated in his chair with his back to the viewer while talking to his employee Michael Anthony (fellow voice-artist Marvin Miller), on the dramatic series &quot;The Millionaire&quot;.

He was the narrator at the beginning of the film &quot;The Disorderly Orderly&quot; starring Jerry Lewis. He also looped an actor&#x27;s voice in the film &quot;The Ladies Man&quot;, also starring Jerry Lewis.

In 1980, Frees was hired by Program Director Hy Lit to be the voice of radio station WKXW (Kicks 101 1/2).

Frees had a wide range of other roles, usually heard but not seen, and frequently without screen credit. The resonance of his natural voice was similar to that of Orson Welles, and he performed a Welles impression several times. Some highlights of his voice work:
* Narrator for &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;
* Narrated 16 episodes of the NBC military television series &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, starring Dean Fredericks (1958–1959), and appeared on-screen as an RAF officer attached to a USAF command in the pilot episode, &quot;Operation Towline.&quot;
* Narrated the documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer, &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; (1980)
* The Peter Lorre voice in the 1947 Spike Jones RCA Victor recording of the song &quot;My Old Flame&quot;. When talking softly, the voice sounds much like Lorre. When the character segués into a manic rant for a few lines, the voice anticipates the Ludwig Von Drake characterization. Frees appeared on several other Spike Jones recordings including &quot;Pop Corn Sack&quot; also from 1947 in which he provided the voices of Charles Boyer, Edward G. Robinson, Katharine Hepburn and Al Jolson.
* Dialog looping for French actor Jacques Roux, among other uncredited voice work, in the 1963 film &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot;
* The Orson Welles sound-alike narrator in &quot;Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America Vol. 1: The Early Years&quot;. When Vol. 2 came out after his death, he was replaced by Corey Burton.
* The voice of Peter Tishman who purchases Manhattan from the Indians on &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume One: The Early Years&quot; (sounding very much like Ludwig Von Drake)
* Another Orson Welles sound-alike as the voice of the aliens in &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot;
* Yet another Orson Welles sound-alike opening the film &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn!&quot;, the American release of &quot;Night of the Eagle&quot; (1962), where for over two minutes he talks about witchcraft and invokes a banishing spell over the audience
* Yet again, as an Orson Welles sound-alike narrator in the 1967 film &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;
* Uncredited voice of a reporter trying to get a quote from General George S. Patton in the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;
* Screen credit for multiple voices in the 1971 animated television film &quot;The Point!&quot;
* Uncredited voice of the sentient supercomputer Colossus in the film &quot;&quot;
* Narration for the spoof short film &quot;Hardware Wars&quot; (1977), which was styled as a mock film trailer specifically parodying Malachi Throne&#x27;s narration of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trailer
* Second Voice of KARR in &quot;K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R.&quot;a 3rd-season episode of &quot;Knight Rider&quot;

* Voice of the title character in the 1957 film &quot;The Cyclops&quot;
* Narrator of extended recap title sequence in early first-season episodes of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; in 1965 (and the show&#x27;s sponsor I.D. announcer during season one)

===Other credits===
Although Frees was primarily known for his voice work (like Mel Blanc, he was known in the industry as &quot;The Man of a Thousand Voices&quot;), he was also a songwriter and screenwriter. His most notable screenwriting work was the little-seen 1960 film &quot;The Beatniks&quot;, a screed against the then-rising Beat counterculture in the vein of &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;. In 1992, the film was mocked on an episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

On rare occasions, Frees appeared on-camera, usually in minor roles. In 1954, he appeared in the film noir classic &quot;Suddenly&quot; starring Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden. He played a scientist in &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, a death-row priest in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, and French fur trader McMasters in &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. In 1955, he appeared as an irate husband suing his wife (played by Ann Doran) for alimony in an episode of CBS&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Ray Milland Show&quot;; and, in 1957, in an uncredited role as a helicopter pilot in the 1957 science-fiction movie, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;.

In &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;, Frees plays a menacing Soviet officer whose job is to watchdog pilot Janet Leigh, but instead manages to eject himself from a parked jet, enabling Leigh to rescue John Wayne and fly back to the West. He is also credited with narrating the opening of the 1958-1959 series &quot;Rescue 8&quot; starring Jim Davis and Lang Jefferies. In the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;, Frees provided the voices of a war correspondent interviewing Patton while Patton rides his horse, and of a member of Patton&#x27;s staff, as well as voice-overs for several other actors, including the Moroccan official hosting a troop review for Patton. Frees is also heard in &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; as the English-language voice of the Japanese ambassador to the United States. He also does the final narration in &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;, the first sequel to &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.

==Legacy==
Since Frees&#x27;s death, voice actor Corey Burton has provided voices for some of Frees&#x27;s characters. Burton, who met Frees in the late 1970s, has often re-recorded dialogue for some Disneyland attractions originally recorded by Frees. In some cases, Frees&#x27;s original, pre-digital recordings had simply deteriorated over time, and in others the dialogue had been rewritten to reflect plot changes or introduce new characters, such as the &quot;Stuffed Pirate&quot; replacing Frees&#x27;s &quot;Pooped Pirate&quot; in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in 1997. Dialogue that was slightly rewritten to reflect newer safety standards is performed by actors Joe Leahy (English) and Fabio Rodriguez (Spanish). In 2001, Burton provided a Paul Frees impression for the new &quot;Ghost Host&quot; of Haunted Mansion Holiday, a seasonal, holiday-themed overlay for the Haunted Mansion attraction. Burton also recorded Frees&#x27;s Ghost Host lines for Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; 2003 film adaptation of the ride.

Voice actor Jim Kirk has also done several impressions of the &quot;Ghost Host&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Haunted Mansion on Instagram and TikTok.

==Personal life==
Frees was married five times. His first marriage was to Anelle McCloud, from 1943 until her death in 1945. He then married Kleda June Hansen in 1947, but they divorced three years later in 1950. His third wife was Joyce Schultz. They married in 1951 and had two children before eventually divorcing. His fourth marriage was to Jeri J. Cole in 1967, but they divorced after just two years, in 1969. Beverly T. Marlow was Frees&#x27;s fifth wife. They married in 1971 but were estranged at the time of his death fifteen years later.

==Death==
For the last two years of his life, Frees suffered from multiple ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, and loss of vision, and had mentioned to friends that he was in near constant pain. Frees died at his home in Tiburon, California, on November 2, 1986, at the age of 66, from a self-administered overdose of pain medication. Despite his death being considered a suicide, his agent issued a press release stating that he died from heart failure.

Frees was survived by his son and daughter, and by Marlow, who had moved to Mesa, Arizona. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean.

<text>The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) is an famous art museum in Washington, D.C., United States. Founded in 1962 and opened in 1968, it is part of the Smithsonian Institution. Its collections focus on images of famous and powerful Americans. Along with the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the museum is housed in the historic Old Patent Office Building.

==History==

===Founding of the museum===

The first portrait gallery in the United States was Charles Willson Peale&#x27;s &quot;American Pantheon&quot;, also known as &quot;Peale&#x27;s Collection of Portraits of American Patriots&quot;, established in 1796. It closed after two years. In 1859, the National Portrait Gallery in London opened, but few Americans took notice. The idea of a federally owned national portrait gallery can be traced back to 1886, when Robert C. Winthrope, president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, visited the National Portrait Gallery in London. Upon his return to the United States, Winthrope began pressing for the establishment of a similar museum in the United States.

In January 1919, the Smithsonian Institution entered into a cooperative endeavor with the American Federation of Arts and the American Mission to Negotiate Peace to create a National Art Committee. The committee&#x27;s goal was to commission portraits of famous leaders from the various nations involved in World War I. Among the committee&#x27;s members were oil company executive Herbert L. Pratt, Ethel Sperry Crocker, an art aficionado and wife of William Henry Crocker, the founder of Crocker National Bank, architect Abram Garfield, Mary Williamson Averell, wife of railway executive E. H. Harriman, financier J. P. Morgan, attorney Charles Phelps Taft, brother of President William Howard Taft, steel magnate Henry Clay Frick, and paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott. The portraits commissioned went on display in the National Museum of Natural History in May 1921. This formed the nucleus of what would become the National Portrait Gallery Collection.

In 1937, Andrew Mellon donated his large collection of classic and modernist art to the United States, which led to the foundation of the National Gallery of Art. The collection included a large number of portraits. Mellon asked that, should a portrait gallery be created, the portraits be transferred to it. David E. Finley, Jr., an attorney and one of Mellon&#x27;s closest friends, was named the first director of the National Gallery of Art, and he pushed hard over the next several years for the establishment of a portrait gallery.

In 1957, a proposal was made by the federal government to demolish the Old Patent Office Building. After a public outcry and an agreement to save the historic structure, Congress authorized the Smithsonian Institution to use the structure as a museum in March 1958. Shortly thereafter, the Smithsonian Art Commission asked the Chancellor of the Smithsonian to appoint a committee to organize a national portrait museum and to plan for the establishment of this museum in the Old Patent Office Building. This committee was created in 1960.

The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) was authorized and founded by Congress in 1962. The enabling legislation defined its purpose as displaying portraits of &quot;men and women who have made significant contributions to the history, development, and culture of the people of the United States.&quot; The legislation specified, however, that the museum&#x27;s collection be limited to painting, prints, drawings, and engravings. Despite the Smithsonian&#x27;s own extensive collection of art and Mellon&#x27;s collection, there was very little for the National Portrait Gallery to display. &quot;To found a portrait gallery in the 1960s,&quot; Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley said, was difficult because &quot;American portraiture has already reached the zenith in price and the nadir in supply.&quot; Ripley, whose leadership of the Smithsonian began in 1964, was a strong supporter of the new museum, however. He encouraged the museum&#x27;s curators to build a collection from scratch based on individual pieces chosen through high-quality scholarship rather than buying complete collections from others. The NPG&#x27;s collection was slowly built over the next five years through donations and purchases. The museum had little money at this time. Often, it located items it wanted and then asked the owner to simply donate it.

The first NPG exhibit, &quot;Nucleus for a National Collection&quot;, went on display in the Arts and Industries Building in 1965 (the bicentennial of James Smithson&#x27;s birth). The following year, the NPG completed the Catalog of American Portraits, the first inventory of portraiture held by the Smithsonian. The catalog also documented the physical characteristics of each artwork, and its provenance (author, date, ownership, etc.). The museum moved into the Old Patent Office Building with the National Fine Arts Collection in 1966. It opened to the public on October 7, 1968.

===Building the collection===
The Old Patent Office Building was renovated in 1969 by the architectural firm of Faulkner, Fryer and Vanderpool. The renovation won the American Institute of Architects National Honor Award in 1970. The following year, the NPG began the National Portrait Survey, an attempt to catalog and photograph all portraits in all formats held by every public and private collection and museum in the country. On July 4, 1973, the NPG opened &quot;The Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution, 1770–1800&quot;, the first exhibit at the museum dedicated solely to African Americans. Philanthropist Paul Mellon donated 761 portraits by French-American engraver C.B.J.F. de Saint-Mémin to the museum in 1974.

Congress passed legislation in January 1976 allowing the National Portrait Gallery to collect portraits in media other than graphic arts. This permitted the NPG to begin collecting photographs. The Library of Congress had long opposed the move in order to protect its own role in collecting photographs, but NPG Director Marvin Sadik fought hard to have the ban eliminated. The NPG rapidly expanded its photography collection, and in October 1976 established a Department of Photographs. The gallery&#x27;s first photography exhibit, &quot;Facing the Light: Historic American Portrait Daguerreotypes&quot;, opened in September 1978. It also continued to build its other collections. In February 1977, the museum acquired an 1880 self-portrait by Mary Cassatt, one of only two painted by her. Eleven months later, the museum acquired a self-portrait by John Singleton Copley. The roundel (a circular canvas), one of only four self-portraits by the celebrated early American artist, was donated to the NPG by the Cafritz Foundation.

In May 1978, &quot;Time&quot; magazine donated 850 original portraits which had graced its cover between 1928 and 1978. A major exhibit of these pieces debuted in May 1979.

===The Stuarts controversy===

A major controversy occurred in 1979 over the National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s attempt to buy two Gilbert Stuart paintings. The famous, unfinished portraits of George and Martha Washington were owned by the Boston Athenaeum, which loaned them to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1876. But the Athenaeum, a private collection, was suffering from financial difficulties by the late 1970s. It twice offered to sell the two portraits to the Museum of Fine Arts over the previous two years, but the museum declined to purchase them. The Athenaeum began searching for another buyer, and in early 1979 the Athenaeum tentatively reached an agreement to sell the works to the NPG for $5 million. When the Athenaeum made these discussions public in April 1979, there was strong public opposition to the sale in Boston.

NPG director Marvin Sadik declined to cancel the sale, arguing that the portraits were of national historic value and belonged in the Smithsonian. A campaign by prominent Bostonians tried to raise $5 million to keep the portraits in Massachusetts. Boston Mayor Kevin H. White sued to keep the portraits in Boston, naming Massachusetts Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, whose office the Commonwealth&#x27;s constitution designates &quot;custodian of public property&quot; in the suit. &quot;Everybody knows Washington has no culture—they have to buy it,&quot; White said.

On April 12, the Athenaeum and NPG agreed to delay the sale until December 31, 1979, to give the Boston fund-raising effort a chance. Although not completely successful, the lawsuit had one effect: Attorney General Bellotti announced in mid-summer that the Stuart portraits could not be sold without his permission. By November 1979, the fund-raising campaign had netted only $885,631, with a pledge from the Museum of Fine Arts to match the amount if necessary. This left the campaign $4 million short of the purchase price. The Athenaeum refused to lower the price, describing the $5 million listing as a significant discount from the portraits&#x27; real value.

With public and political pressure on the Smithsonian to resolve the issue, the Museum of Fine Arts and NPG agreed on February 7, 1980, to jointly purchase the portraits. Under the agreement, the paintings would spend three years at the National Portrait Gallery (beginning in July 1980), and then three years in Boston at the Museum of Fine Arts. Attorney General Bellotti approved the plan in March. Per the agreement, the portraits went on display in Washington on July 1, 1980.

NPG director Marvin Sadik, who had expressed his dissatisfaction over the Stuart painting controversy, took a six-month-long sabbatical in January 1981. He announced his retirement from the museum in July.

===Expanding the collection===
Even as the Stuarts controversy occupied the attention of the press, the National Portrait Gallery continued to expand its collection. In April 1979, it obtained five other portraits by Gilbert Stuart. These five paintings — of presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, John Adams, and James Madison — were known as the Gibbs-Coolidge set. The portraits were donated by the Coolidge family of Boston (without controversy). In December, the museum obtained a bust of Alexander Hamilton by John Trumbull (which may have been sculpted from the portrait which was later used for the $10 bill) and a Gilbert Stuart portrait of Representative Fisher Ames from the Henry Cabot Lodge family in Massachusetts. The following April, Varina Webb Stewart and Joel A.H. Webb presented important portraits of Jefferson Davis and his wife, Varina Howell Davis, to the National Portrait Gallery. (Stewart and Webb were the Davis&#x27; great-grandchildren.) In 1980, the museum obtained (through purchase and loan) a number of works by graphic artist Howard Chandler Christy for exhibit. Works displayed ranged from his &quot;Christy girl&quot; recruiting posters to history-based works such as &quot;Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States&quot;.
By 1981, the museum had more than 2,000 items in its collection. Two major 19th-century photography collections were added by the museum that year. The first such acquisition was the Frederick Hill Meserve Collection of 5,419 glass negatives produced by the studio of famed Civil War photographer Mathew Brady and his assistants. Using historically accurate chemicals, paper, and techniques, prints were made of the negatives and the prints placed on rotating display. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; later described the importance of the acquisition by saying it made the NPG the &quot;epicenter&quot; for Brady scholarship. Later that year, 5,400 Civil War-era glass negatives produced by photographer Alexander Gardner were also purchased from the Meserve family. This included the famous &quot;cracked-plate&quot; portrait of Abraham Lincoln taken in February 1865, which was the last photographic portrait of Lincoln taken before his death in April 1865.

Two major portrait purchases were also made in the early 1980s. One was a Gilbert Stuart portrait of Thomas Jefferson, for which the museum paid $1 million to a private collector. A portion of the purchase price came from the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and operates Jefferson&#x27;s historic plantation home of Monticello. The two parties agreed have the portrait spend time at both locations. The second major purchase was an Edgar Degas portrait of his friend, Mary Cassatt, for which the museum paid $1.3 million.

The museum suffered a major theft in 1984 — although it was not a portrait. On December 31, 1984, a thief pried open a display case and stole four handwritten documents accompanying several portraits of Civil War generals. One of the documents was written and signed by President Abraham Lincoln. The remaining three were written and signed by Civil War generals Ulysses S. Grant, George Meade, and George Armstrong Custer. The FBI was contacted and worked with Smithsonian police to investigate the crime. Within two weeks, a historic documents dealer contacted the FBI and said he had been offered the documents for sale. On February 8, 1985, police arrested Norman James Chandler, a part-time mechanic&#x27;s assistant from Maryland, for the theft. Chandler quickly pleaded guilty. He was sentenced in April 1985 to two years in jail (with all but six months suspended) and two years of probation, and required to pay a $2,000 fine. All four documents were recovered.

The late 1980s saw the collection continue to expand, although there were fewer major additions. One significant acquisition was a nude image — a self-portrait painting by Alice Neel acquired in 1985. It was the National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s first nude work. Neel was 80 years old when she painted it. Two years later, noted photographer Irving Penn donated 120 platinum prints of fashion and celebrity portraits he produced over the past 50 years.

Two very important daguerreotypes (an early photographic process) were purchased in the 1990s. The first was of African American abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass, acquired in 1990. It is one of only four daguerreotypes of Douglass known to exist. That year, the number of images in the museum&#x27;s photography collection reached 8,500 objects. Six years later, the NPG obtained for $115,000 the earliest known daguerreotype of abolitionist John Brown, whose 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry helped to spark the Civil War. The portrait was created by African American photographer Augustus Washington.

===Purchasing the Lansdowne portrait===

In the fall of 2000, Neil Primrose, 7th Earl of Rosebery, offered to sell Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s Lansdowne portrait of George Washington to the National Portrait Gallery. The painting was commissioned in April 1796 by Senator William Bingham of Pennsylvania—one of the wealthiest men in America at the time. The portrait was given as a gift to British Prime Minister William Petty FitzMaurice. FitzMaurice was the 2nd Earl of Shelburne, and later became the first Marquess of Lansdowne (hence the name of the portrait). Lansdowne died in 1805, and in 1890 the painting was purchased by the 5th Earl of Rosebery. The Lansdowne portrait was displayed only three times in the United States (although several copies remained in America). On its third trip in 1968, it was exhibited by the National Portrait Gallery, and it remained there on indefinite loan. Lord Rosebery offered to sell the painting for $20 million, a price at the low end of estimates. But the offer came with a deadline of April 1, 2001. A search for a donor, personally led by Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence Small and the Smithsonian&#x27;s Board of Regents, proved fruitless after three months. Worried Smithsonian officials then went public in February 2001 with a plea for a donor to come forth.

On March 13, just two weeks before the sale deadline, the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation donated $30 million to buy the Lansdowne portrait. Foundation chairman Fred W. Smith read about failing donor effort in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; on February 26. Although the Reynolds Foundation generally only made grants in the areas of elder care, cardiovascular research, and journalism, assisting with the Lansdowne purchase fell within the foundation&#x27;s &quot;special projects&quot; area of responsibility. NPG Director Marc Pachter flew to Nevada to meet with foundation officials on March 3, and the foundation approved the donation the following day. The $30 million donation included $6 million to put the portrait on a national tour for three years (the NPG was closed for renovations until 2006), and $4 million to construct a new area in the Old Patent Office Building to display it. NPG said it would name this display area for Donald W. Reynolds, the media baron who created the foundation.

===Post-renovation activities===
The National Portrait Gallery closed in January 2000 for a renovation of the Old Patent Office Building. Intended to take two years and cost $42 million, the renovation took seven years and cost $283 million. Inflation, delays in obtaining approval for the renovation design, the addition of a glass canopy over the open courtyard, and other issues led to increases in both time and costs. During this period, most of the NPG&#x27;s collection went on tour around the United States.

In March 2007, a multi-year study of leadership at eight Smithsonian museums made recommendations about the National Portrait Gallery. The report concluded that the museum needed stronger, more visionary leadership intent on creating a truly national museum. The report also called for &quot;administrative consolidation&quot; of the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

After the 2008 presidential election, the National Portrait Gallery obtained graphic artist Shepard Fairey&#x27;s ubiquitous &quot;Hope&quot; poster of Barack Obama. Obama supporter Tony Podesta and his wife, Heather, donated it to the museum.

===Hide/Seek controversy===
In November 2010, the National Portrait Gallery hosted a major new exhibit, &quot;Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture&quot;, curated by David C. Ward and Jonathan Katz. The exhibit focused on depictions of homosexual love through history, and was the first exhibit hosted by a museum of national stature to address the topic. It was also the largest and most expensive exhibit in the NPG&#x27;s history, and more private donors contributed to it than to any prior NPG exhibit. Included in the 105 pieces in the exhibit was a four-minute, edited version of artist David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s short silent film &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot;. Eleven seconds of the video depicted a crucifix covered in ants.

The exhibit was scheduled to run from October 30, 2010, to February 13, 2011. Within days of its opening, Catholic League president William A. Donohue labeled &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; hate speech, anti-Catholic, and anti-Christian. A spokesperson for Representative John Boehner, incoming Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, called it an &quot;arrogant&quot; abuse of the public trust and a misuse of taxpayer money, although it was funded by private donations. House Majority Leader Representative Eric Cantor threatened to reduce the Smithsonian&#x27;s budget if the film remained on view. After consulting with National Portrait Gallery director Martin Sullivan, co-curator David C. Ward (but not with co-curator Jonathan David Katz), Smithsonian Undersecretary Richard Kurin, and the Smithsonian&#x27;s government affairs and public relations offices, Smithsonian Secretary G. Wayne Clough ordered &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; removed from the exhibit on November 30.

Clough&#x27;s decision led to extensive accusations of censorship and claims that the Smithsonian was caving in to pressure from a small group of vocal activists. Smithsonian officials strongly defended the video&#x27;s removal. &quot;The decision wasn&#x27;t caving in,&quot; said Sullivan. &quot;We don&#x27;t want to shy away from anything that is controversial, but we want to focus on the museum&#x27;s and this show&#x27;s strengths.&quot; Kurin expressed the Smithsonian&#x27;s desire to be responsive to public opinion, but also emphasized the remaining exhibit&#x27;s importance. &quot;We are sensitive to what the public thinks about our shows and programs,&quot; he said. &quot;We stand behind the show. It has strong scholarship with great pieces by artists who are recognized by a whole panoply of experts. It represents a segment of America.&quot; On December 13, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, one of the principal sponsors of the exhibit, said it would ask for its $100,000 donation back if the film was not restored. Clough replied, &quot;...the Smithsonian&#x27;s decision to remove the video was a difficult one and we stand by it.&quot; The donation was returned, and the Warhol Foundation ceased to support National Portrait Gallery exhibits. The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, which donated $10,000 to support the exhibit, also ended all funding for future Smithsonian exhibitions. Both decisions drew criticism from some gay rights supporters, who felt the funding cuts were too draconian since the remainder of the pieces continued to be exhibited.

The controversy lasted through the exhibit&#x27;s scheduled run. In late January 2011, the Smithsonian Board of Regents unanimously gave Clough a vote of confidence, saying his accomplishments in improving the Smithsonian&#x27;s administration, finances, governance, and maintenance in the past 19 months far outweighed the damage done by the &quot;Hide/Seek&quot; controversy. Clough admitted, however, that he may have acted too hastily in the matter (although he continued to say he made the right decision), and the regents asked for Smithsonian staff to study the controversy and report back on how to handle such events in the future. Not everyone in the Smithsonian agreed with the regents. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that some (unnamed) Smithsonian museum directors and curators felt there would be a chilling effect from Clough&#x27;s decision. The Board of Directors of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden wrote an open letter to Clough in which they said they were &quot;deeply troubled by the precedent&quot; to remove the film.

=== Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition ===

In 2006, the museum began hosting a triennial, juried contemporary portrait exhibition called the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. Named after long time docent and volunteer Virginia Outwin Boochever, this competition is widely regarded as the most prestigious portrait competition in the United States. Artists working in the fields of painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, and other media are allowed to enter. Works must be created through a face-to-face encounter with the subject. The inaugural competition in 2006 drew more than 4000 entries, from which 51 finalists were chosen. For the 2013 competition the total prize money of $42,000 was awarded to the top eight commended artists, and the winner received $25,000 and a commission to make a portrait for the museum&#x27;s permanent collection. The subject of the commission is decided jointly by the artist and the NPG curators. The 2006 winner was David Lenz of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and he was commissioned to paint a portrait of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics. It was the first portrait commissioned of an individual who has not served as a president or first lady. The 2009 winner, Dave Woody of Fort Collins, Colorado, was commissioned to photograph food pioneer Alice Waters, founder of the Chez Panisse Restaurant and Cafe, the Edible Schoolyard and champion of the Slow Food movement. The 2013 winner was Bo Gehring of Beacon, New York, who was commissioned to direct a video portrait of jazz musician Esperanza Spalding.

===Post-2010 exhibits of note===
In 2012, the National Portrait Gallery sponsored a new temporary exhibit, &quot;Poetic Likeness: Modern American Poets&quot;, which focused on images of great American poets. The NPG collection had grown so large that the exhibit drew its images almost entirely from the museum&#x27;s own collection.

==Collection==

As of 2011, the National Portrait Gallery was the only museum in the United States dedicated solely to portraiture. The museum had 65 employees and a $9 million annual budget in 2013. By February 2013, it housed 21,200 works of art, which had been seen by 1,069,932 visitors in 2012.

===Portrait addition procedure===
By 1977, the National Portrait Gallery had three curatorial divisions: Painting and sculpture, prints and drawings, and photography.

Initially, the National Portrait Gallery had fairly strict rules regarding which images could enter its collection. The person depicted had to be historically significant. An individual also needed to be dead at least 10 years before their portrait could be displayed (although some images of obviously important living people were acquired while they still lived). After an initial affirmative determination by curators at a monthly curatorial meeting, the National Portrait Gallery Commission (the museum&#x27;s board of directors) approved the person&#x27;s inclusion. The commission was initially quite conservative in its assessment of &quot;historically significant&quot;, although this position began to be more relaxed by 1969. As of 2006, the definition of &quot;historically significant&quot; had become quite loose, although &quot;some kind of fame or notoriety remains a prerequisite&quot;. Portraits of living individuals or those dead less than 10 years are also now allowed to be displayed in the museum, as long as their inclusion is clearly important (such as presidents or generals).

The process for choosing which images the museum acquires is simple but can be contentious. Potential acquisitions are vigorously and informally discussed at length by researchers, historians, and the curatorial departments. Some of the criteria used in the decision-making process are: The number of existing portraits of the individual already in the collection, the quality of the potential portrait, the uniqueness of the potential portrait, the reputation of the portrait&#x27;s author, and the cost of the portrait. Formal decisions to acquire a portrait are made at monthly curatorial meetings, then ratified by the National Portrait Gallery Commission.

===Key exhibits and programs of the museum===
A hallmark of the National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection is the Hall of Presidents, which contains portraits of nearly all American presidents. It is the largest and most complete collection in the world, except for the White House collection itself. The centerpiece of the Hall of Presidents is the famous Lansdowne portrait of George Washington. How the museum obtains presidential images has changed over the years. Presidential portraits from 1962 to 1987 were usually obtained through purchase or donation. Beginning in 1998, NPG began commissioning portraits of presidents, starting with George H. W. Bush. In 2000, NPG began commissioning portraits of First Ladies as well, beginning with Hillary Clinton. Funds for these commissions are privately raised, and each portrait costs about $150,000 to $200,000. Former president Trump has used his Save America PAC to pay $650,000 for portraits of him and the former first lady that will one day hang in the National Portrait Gallery.

==Building==

The National Portrait Gallery occupies a portion of the Old Patent Office Building, a National Historic Landmark. The building is located just south of Chinatown in downtown Washington. Constructed between 1836 and 1867, the building has a sandstone and marble façade, and porticoes modeled after the Parthenon.

The building was used as a hospital during the American Civil War, and both Clara Barton and Walt Whitman worked as nurses there. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, the United States General Land Office, and the Bureau of Pensions jointly occupied the building with the Patent Office through the Civil War and into the post-war period. The massive increase in pension processing required by the Civil War led to the construction of a new Pension Bureau Building into which the Bureau of Pensions moved in 1887. The General Land Office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs vacated the building in 1898. The United States Civil Service Commission and the Government Accounting Office occupied the building after the Patent Office vacated it in 1932. The Government Accounting Office vacated the structure in 1942, after its new headquarters nearby was complete. The Civil Service Commission began constructing its own headquarters, and planned to vacate the building in 1962.

Local D.C. businessmen asked the General Services Administration (GSA) to tear down the building and sell the land so a private parking garage could be built on the centrally located site. Legislation for this purpose was introduced in Congress in the waning days of the 82nd United States Congress in 1952, but did not pass. The legislation encountered resistance from a few members of Congress, architects, and the influential Committee of 100 on the Federal City (a non-profit advocate for responsible planning and land use). GSA reversed course and said in June 1956 it no longer wanted to demolish the building. However, the agency said it would continue to use it for federal office space (which was in short supply) until the Civil Service Commission vacated the structure. On March 21, 1958, Congress unanimously passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the building to the Smithsonian for a national art museum. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the legislation a few days later.

Congress passed legislation establishing the National Portrait Gallery in 1962, and the Civil Service Commission moved out of the structure in November 1963. Preparations for the renovation began in November 1964, and the Grunley, Walsh Construction Co. began demolition of non-historic interior structures by May 1965. The $6 million renovation was complete by April 1968, and the National Portrait Gallery opened on October 7.

===2000 to 2007 renovation===

In 1995, the Smithsonian revealed that the Old Patent Office Building was in serious disrepair. The Smithsonian announced in January 1997 that the building would close in January 2000 for a two-year, $42 million renovation. Hartman-Cox Architects was hired to oversee the conservation and repair. But just three years later, as the renovation was about to begin, the cost of repairs had risen to $110 million to $120 million.

Prior to the building&#x27;s closure in January 2000, a decision was reached to allot about one-third of the building&#x27;s total space to the National Portrait Gallery while simultaneously eliminating the informal north–south division between the NPG and American Art Museum. This led to acrimony between the two museums, and a public debate about which collection deserved more space. The Smithsonian resolved the dispute practically: Art that best fit an exhibition space got it. (For example, since modern art often tends toward large canvases, this art is on the high-ceilinged third floor.)

The cost of the renovation rose to $180 million by March 2001. That month, Nan Tucker McEvoy (a California newspaper heiress and arts patron) donated $10 million for the renovation. The Henry Luce Foundation gave another $10 million later that year. Costs continued to rise. Although Congress appropriated $33.5 million for the renovation, reconstruction costs were estimated at $214 million in June 2001 and the museum not scheduled to reopen until 2005. Just a month later, the reopening was pushed back even further to July 2006.

In 2003, the government increased its contribution to $166 million. Smithsonian officials subsequently began discussing a major change to the renovation design: Adding a glass roof to the open courtyard in the center of the Old Patent Office Building. Congress approved the change in August 2003. In March 2004, the Smithsonian announced that architect Norman Foster, would design the glass canopy. In November, Robert Kogod (a real estate development executive) and his wife, Arlene (heiress to Charles E. Smith Construction fortune) donated $25 million to complete the canopy. By then, costs had risen to $298 million. $60 million in private funds still needed to be raised. Today, the Kogod Courtyard is a popular meeting place in DC. There is plenty of seating, free wifi, and a cafe with snacks for museum visitors open from 11:30 am until 6:30 pm.

Design approval for the canopy proved difficult. The design had to be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which has statutory authority to approve all buildings and renovations in the D.C. metropolitan area. Although the NCPC approved the preliminary design, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), the United States Department of the Interior, the D.C. State Preservation Office, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation all opposed the enclosure of the courtyard. The NCPC reversed its preliminary approval on June 2, 2005. Unwilling to lose the canopy, the Smithsonian brought five alternatives to the NCPC on August 4. On September 8, 2005, the NCPC reversed itself yet again, and approved one of the revised designs. The delay cost the Smithsonian $10 million. In October 2005, the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation made a $45 million donation to the NPG to finish both the building renovation and the canopy. The Smithsonian agreed to call the two museums, the conservation center, courtyard, storage facility, and other operations within the Old Patent Office complex the &quot;Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture&quot; in appreciation for the gift. The National Portrait Gallery reopened on July 1, 2006. The total cost of the building&#x27;s renovation was $283 million.

Attendance at the renovated building rose significantly to 214,495 in just two months. In the past, both museums had drawn just 450,000 over 12 months. The achievement was even more impressive in the face of flat or declining attendance at all other Smithsonian museums. The higher attendance was not all positive. Some patrons spit on art they did not like, while others kissed or touched some paintings. Video security cameras were hastily installed in September 2007 to stop the vandalism. By the end of the year, more than 786,000 people had visited the two museums.

==Governance and directors==
The National Portrait Gallery is governed by a board of directors known as the National Portrait Gallery Commission. The commission members are appointed by the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. The museum is led by a Director, who oversees its day-to-day activities. Directors of the museum include:

*Charles Nagel – July 1, 1964 – 1969
*Marvin Sadik – 1969 – July 1981
*Alan M. Fern – June 1982 – 2000
*Marc Pachter – 2000–2007
*Martin E. Sullivan – 2008–2012
*Wendy Wick Reaves – 2012–2013 (interim)
*Kim Sajet – April 2013–

<text>The National Electrical Code (NEC), or NFPA 70, is a regionally adoptable standard for the safe installation of electrical wiring and equipment in the United States. It is part of the National Fire Code series published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), a private trade association. Despite the use of the term &quot;national,&quot; it is not a federal law. It is typically adopted by states and municipalities in an effort to standardize their enforcement of safe electrical practices. In some cases, the NEC is amended, altered and may even be rejected in lieu of regional regulations as voted on by local governing bodies. 

The &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; inspects for compliance with the standards.

The NEC should not be confused with the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The NESC is used for electric power and communication utility systems including overhead lines, underground lines, and power substations.

==Background==
The NEC is developed by NFPA&#x27;s Committee on the National Electrical Code, which consists of twenty code-making panels and a technical correlating committee. Work on the NEC is sponsored by the National Fire Protection Association. The NEC is approved as an American national standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). It is formally identified as ANSI/NFPA 70.

First published in 1897, the NEC is updated and published every three years, with the 2023 edition being the most current. Most states adopt the most recent edition within a few of years of its publication. As with any &quot;uniform&quot; code, jurisdictions may regularly omit or modify some sections, or add their own requirements (sometimes based upon earlier versions of the NEC, or locally accepted practices). However, no court has faulted anyone for using the latest version of the NEC, even when the local code was not updated.

In the United States, anyone, including the city issuing building permits, may face a civil liability lawsuit for negligently creating a situation that results in loss of life or property. Those who fail to adhere to well known best practices for safety have been held negligent. This liability and the desire to protect residents has motivated cities to adopt and enforce building codes that specify standards and practices for electrical systems (as well as other departments such as water and fuel-gas systems). That creates a system whereby a city can best avoid lawsuits by adopting a single standard set of building code laws. This has led to the NEC becoming the de facto standard set of electrical requirements. A licensed electrician will have spent years of apprenticeship studying and practicing the NEC requirements prior to obtaining their license.

The Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) customized extension of the electrical code standard defined by National Electrical Code was developed since current engineering standards and code requirements do not adequately address the unique situations arising during D&amp;D activities at U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. The additional guidance is needed to clarify the current electrical code for these situations. The guidance document provides guidance on how to interpret selected articles of NFPA 70, “National Electrical Code” (NEC), in particular certain articles within Article 590, “Temporary Power,” for D&amp;D electrical activities at DOE sites.

The NEC also contains information about the official definition of HAZLOC and the related standards given by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and dealing with hazardous locations such as explosive atmospheres.

===Public access===
The NEC is available as a bound book containing approximately 1000 pages. It has been available in electronic form since the 1993 edition. Although the code is updated every three years, some jurisdictions do not immediately adopt the new edition.

The NEC is also available as a restricted, digitized &quot;coding model&quot; that can be read online free of charge on certain computing platforms that support the restricted viewer software; however this digital version cannot be saved, copied, or printed.

In the United States, statutory law cannot be copyrighted and is freely accessible and copyable by anyone. When a standards organization develops a new coding model and it is not yet accepted by any jurisdiction as law, it is still the private property of the standards organization and the reader may be restricted from downloading or printing the text for offline viewing. For that privilege, the coding model must still be purchased as either printed media or electronic format (e.g. PDF.) Once the coding model has been accepted as law, it loses copyright protection and may be freely obtained at no cost.

==Structure==
The NEC is composed of an introduction, nine chapters, annexes A through J, and the index. The introduction sets forth the purpose, scope, enforcement, and rules or information that are general in nature. The first four chapters cover definitions and rules for installations (voltages, connections, markings, etc.), circuits and circuit protection, methods and materials for wiring (wiring devices, conductors, cables, etc.), and general-purpose equipment (cords, receptacles, switches, heaters, etc.). The next three chapters deal with special occupancies (high risk to multiple persons), special equipment (signs, machinery, etc.) and special conditions (emergency systems, alarms, etc.). Chapter 8 is specific to additional requirements for communications systems (telephone, radio/TV, etc.) and chapter 9 is composed of tables regarding conductor, cable and conduit properties, among other things. Annexes A-J relate to referenced standards, calculations, examples, additional tables for proper implementation of various code articles (for example, how many wires fit in a conduit) and a model adoption ordinance.

The introduction and the first 8 chapters contain numbered parts, articles, sections (or lists or tables), item, specifics, inclusions/exclusions, precise inclusion/exclusion, italicized exceptions, and explanatory material – explanations that are not part of the rules. Articles are coded with numerals and letters, as ###.###(A)(#)(a). For example, 805.133(A)(1)(a)(1), would be read as &quot;article 805, section 133, item (A) Separation from Other Conductors, specific (1) In Raceways, cable Trays, Boxes... inclusion (a) Other Circuits, precise inclusion (1) Class 2 and Class 3...&quot; and would be found in Chapter 8, Part IV Installation Methods Within Buildings. For internal references, some lengthy articles are further broken into &quot;parts&quot; with Roman-numerals (parts I, II, III, etc.).

Each code article is numbered based on the chapter it is in. Those wiring methods acceptable by the NEC are found in chapter 3, thus all approved wiring method code articles are in the 300s. Efforts have been underway for some time to make the code easier to use. Some of those efforts include using the same extension for both code articles and for the support of wiring methods.

The NFPA also publishes a 1,497-page NEC Handbook (for each new NEC edition) that contains the entire code, plus additional illustrations and explanations, and helpful cross-references within the code and to earlier versions of the code. The explanations are only for reference and are not enforceable.

Many NEC requirements refer to &quot;listed&quot; or &quot;labeled&quot; devices and appliances, and this means that the item has been designed, manufactured, tested or inspected, and marked in accordance with requirements of the listing agency. To be listed, the device must meet testing and other requirements set by a listing agency such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), SGS North America, Intertek (Formerly ETL), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), or FM Approvals (FM). These are examples of &quot;national recognized testing laboratories&quot; (NRTL) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7. Only a listed device can carry the listing brand (or &quot;mark&quot;) of the listing agency. Upon payment of an investigation fee to determine suitability, an investigation is started. To be labeled as fit for a particular purpose (for example &quot;wet locations&quot;, &quot;domestic range&quot;) a device must be tested for that specific use by the listing agency and then the appropriate label applied to the device. A fee is paid to the listing agency for each item so labeled, that is, for each label. Most NRTLs will also require that the manufacturer&#x27;s facilities and processes be inspected as evidence that a product will be manufactured reliably and with the same qualities as the sample or samples submitted for evaluation. An NRTL may also conduct periodic sample testing of off-the-shelf products to confirm that safety design criteria are being upheld during production. Because of the reputation of these listing agencies, the &quot;authority having jurisdiction&quot; ( or &quot;AHJ&quot; – as they are commonly known) usually will quickly accept any device, appliance, or piece of equipment having such a label, provided that an end user or installer uses the product in accordance with manufacturer&#x27;s instructions and the limitations of the listing standard. However, an AHJ, under the National Electrical Code provisions, has the authority to deny approval for even listed and labeled products. Likewise, an AHJ may make a written approval of an installation or product that does not meet either NEC or listing requirements, although this is normally done only after an appropriate review of the specific conditions of a particular case or location.

==Requirements==
Article 210 addresses &quot;branch circuits&quot; (as opposed to service or feeder circuits) and receptacles and fixtures on branch circuits.Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine, Branch Circuits, Part 2. There are requirements for the minimum number of branches, and placement of receptacles, according to the location and purpose of the receptacle outlet. Ten important items in Article 210 have been summarized in a codebook.

Feeder and branch circuit wiring systems are designed primarily for copper conductors. Aluminum wiring is listed by Underwriters Laboratories for interior wiring applications and became increasingly used around 1966 due to its lower cost. Prior to 1972, however, the aluminum wire used was manufactured to conform to the 1350 series aluminum alloy, but this alloy was eventually deemed unsuitable for branch circuits due to galvanic corrosion where the copper and aluminum touched, resulting in poor contact and resistance to current flow, connector overheating problems, and potential fire risk. Today, a new aluminum wire (AA-8000) has been approved for branch circuits that does not cause corrosion where it contacts copper, but it is not readily available and is not manufactured below size #8 AWG. Hence, copper wire is used almost exclusively in branch circuitry.

A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is required for all receptacles in wet locations defined in the Code. The NEC also has rules about how many circuits and receptacles should be placed in a given residential dwelling, and how far apart they can be in a given type of room, based upon the typical cord length of small appliances.

As of 1962, the NEC required that new 120 Volt household receptacle outlets, for general purpose use, be both &quot;grounded&quot; and &quot;polarized&quot;. NEMA connectors implement these requirements.

The NEC also permits grounding-type receptacles in non-grounded wiring protected by a GFCI; this only applies when old non-grounded receptacles are replaced with grounded receptacles, and the new receptacles must be marked with &#x27;No equipment ground&#x27; and &#x27;GFCI Protected&#x27; . 
The 1999 Code required that new 120/240 volt receptacles, such as those for electric ranges and dryers, be grounded also, which necessitates a fourth slot in their faces. Changes in standards often create problems for new work in old buildings.

Unlike circuit breakers and fuses, which only open the circuit when the current exceeds a fixed value for a fixed time, a GFCI device will interrupt electrical service when more than 4 to 6 milliamperes of current in either conductor leaks to ground. A GFCI detects an imbalance between the current in the &quot;hot&quot; side and the current in the &quot;neutral&quot; side. One GFCI receptacle can serve as protection for several downstream conventional receptacles. GFCI devices come in many configurations including circuit-breakers, portable devices and receptacles.

Another safety device introduced with the 1999 code is the arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI). This device detects arcs from hot to neutral that can develop when insulation between wires becomes frayed or damaged. While arcs from hot to neutral would not trip a GFCI device since current is still balanced, circuitry in an AFCI device detects those arcs and will shut down a circuit. AFCI devices generally replace the circuit breaker in the circuit. As of the 1999 National Electrical Code, AFCI protection is required in new construction on all 15- and 20-amp, 125-volt circuits to bedrooms.

===Conduit and cable protection===
The NEC requires that conductors of a circuit must be inside a raceway, cable, trench, cord, or cable tray. Additional protection such as NM cable inside raceway is needed if the installation method is subjected to physical damage as determined by the authority having jurisdiction.

===Temperature rating===
The temperature rating of a wire or cable is generally the maximum safe ambient temperature that the wire can carry full-load power without the cable insulation melting, oxidizing, or self-igniting. A full-load wire does heat up slightly due to the metallic resistance of the wire, but this wire heating is factored into the cable&#x27;s temperature rating. (NEC 310.10)

The NEC specifies acceptable numbers of conductors in crowded areas such as inside conduit, referred to as the &quot;fill rating&quot;. If the accepted fill rating is exceeded, then all the cables in the conduit are &quot;derated&quot;, lowering their acceptable maximum ambient operating temperature. Derating is necessary because multiple conductors carrying full-load power generate heat that may exceed the normal insulation temperature rating. (NEC 310.16)

The NEC also specifies adjustments of the ampacity for wires in circular raceways exposed to sunlight on rooftops, due to the heating effects of solar radiation. Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine, Conductors for General Use, Chapter 3 Articles in NEC, starting with Article 342 This section is expected to be modified to include cables in future editions.

In certain situations, temperature rating can be higher than normal, such as for knob-and-tube wiring where two or more load-carrying wires are never likely to be in close proximity. A knob-and-tube installation uses wires suspended in air. This gives them a greater heat dissipation rating than standard three-wire NM-2 cable, which includes two tightly bundled load and return wires.

==Copyright Status==
NEC, like many NFPA standards, relies on sales of its copyrighted standards to fund its development. In 2016, the group PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC published copies of the code online free of cost, arguing that as a standard adopted as law, it should be publicly available. The case challenges the nature of funding sources for development of the standards, which are often adopted as law, but created without taxpayer dollars. NFPA in response has pointed to its making a free version of its standards available online, albeit in a less convenient forum than the standard that is available for purchase.

<doc id="537440" wikidata="Q1411974" url="?curid=537440" title="SRV record">
<text>A Service record (SRV record) is a specification of data in the Domain Name System defining the location, i.e., the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services. It is defined in , and its type code is 33. Some Internet protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) often require SRV support by network elements.

== Record format ==
A SRV record has the form:

* &quot;service&quot;: the symbolic name of the desired service.
* &quot;proto&quot;: the transport protocol of the desired service; this is usually either TCP or UDP.
* &quot;name&quot;: the domain name for which this record is valid, ending in a dot.
* &quot;ttl&quot;: standard DNS time to live field.
* &quot;IN&quot;: standard DNS class field (this is always &quot;IN&quot;).
* &quot;SRV&quot;: Type of Record (this is always &quot;SRV&quot;).
* &quot;priority&quot;: the priority of the target host, lower value means more preferred.
* &quot;weight&quot;: A relative weight for records with the same priority, higher value means higher chance of getting picked.
* &quot;port&quot;: the TCP or UDP port on which the service is to be found.
* &quot;target&quot;: the canonical hostname of the machine providing the service, ending in a dot.

An example SRV record in textual form that might be found in a zone file might be the following:

This points to a server named codice_1 listening on TCP port 5060 for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol services. The priority given here is 0, and the weight is 5.

As in MX records, the target in SRV records must point to hostname with an address record (A or AAAA record). Pointing to a hostname with a CNAME record is not a valid configuration.

== Provisioning for high service availability ==
The &quot;priority&quot; field determines the precedence of the use of the record&#x27;s data. Clients should use the SRV records with the lowest-numbered priority value first, and fall back to records of higher value if the connection fails. If a service has multiple SRV records with the same priority value, clients should load balance them in proportion to the values of their &quot;weight&quot; fields. 
In the following example, both the &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;weight&quot; fields are used to provide a combination of load balancing and backup service. 

The first three records share a priority of 10, so the weight field&#x27;s value will be used by clients to determine which server (host and port combination) to contact. The sum of all three weight values is 100, so codice_2 will be used 60% of the time. The two hosts, codice_3 and codice_4 will be used for 40% of requests total, with half of them sent to codice_3, and the other half to codice_4. If codice_7 is unavailable, these two remaining machines will share the load equally, since they will each be selected 50% of the time.

If all three servers with priority 10 are unavailable, the record with the next lowest priority value will be chosen, which is codice_8. This might be a machine in another physical location, presumably not vulnerable to anything that would cause the first three hosts to become unavailable.

The load balancing provided by SRV records is inherently limited since the information is essentially static. The current load of servers is not taken into account unless TTL values are low enough (around a minute or lower) that the priority (or weight) values can be quickly updated.

== Usage ==
SRV records are common in conjunction with the following standardized communications protocols:
* APT
* CalDAV and CardDAV
* Ceph
* DANE
* DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)
* Factorio
* Host Identity Protocol
* Kerberos
* LDAP
* SMTP submission, POP, and IMAP
* Matrix.org
* Minecraft
* MongoDB
* Mumble
* IMPS
* Puppet
* Rust
* Session Initiation Protocol
* STUN
* Teamspeak 3
* XMPP

In Microsoft Windows 2000 clients query for SRV records to determine the domain controller for a given service. SRV records are also used by Outlook 2007, 2010 and Macintosh 10.6 mail to locate the Exchange Autodiscover service.
In Microsoft Windows networks domain controllers register their network service types for Active Directory in the DNS.

An older version of the Internet Draft for OpenPGP Web Key Directory uses SRV records for discovering OpenPGP keys through web servers. Usages of SRV records are no longer part of the Internet Draft in later versions.

A registry of service names for SRV records &amp; protocols is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as defined in RFC 6335.

<doc id="537442" wikidata="Q184292" url="?curid=537442" title="HDMI">
<text>High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a proprietary audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from a source device, such as a display controller, to a computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.
HDMI implements the ANSI/CTA-861 standard, which defines video formats and waveforms, transport of compressed and uncompressed LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically compatible with the CEA-861 signals used by the Digital Visual Interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.

Several versions of HDMI have been developed and deployed since the initial release of the technology, occasionally introducing new connectors with smaller form factors, but all versions still use the same basic pinout and are compatible with all connector types and cables. Other than improved audio and video capacity, performance, resolution and color spaces, newer versions have optional advanced features such as 3D, Ethernet data connection, and CEC extensions.

Production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003. In Europe, either DVI-HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in-store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV, formulated by EICTA with SES Astra in 2005. HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTVs in 2004 and camcorders and digital still cameras in 2006. , nearly 10 billion HDMI devices have been sold.

==History==
The HDMI founders were Hitachi, Panasonic, Philips, Silicon Image, Sony, Thomson, and Toshiba. Digital Content Protection, LLC provides HDCP (which was developed by Intel) for HDMI. HDMI has the support of motion picture producers Fox, Universal, Warner Bros. and Disney, along with system operators DirecTV, EchoStar (Dish Network) and CableLabs.

The HDMI founders began development on HDMI 1.0 on April 16, 2002, with the goal of creating an AV connector that was backward-compatible with DVI. At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs. HDMI 1.0 was designed to improve on DVI-HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced  capability and consumer electronics control functions.

The first Authorized Testing Center (ATC), which tests HDMI products, was opened by Silicon Image on June 23, 2003, in California, United States. The first ATC in Japan was opened by Panasonic on May 1, 2004, in Osaka. The first ATC in Europe was opened by Philips on May 25, 2005, in Caen, France. The first ATC in China was opened by Silicon Image on November 21, 2005, in Shenzhen. The first ATC in India was opened by Philips on June 12, 2008, in Bangalore. The HDMI website contains a list of all the ATCs.

According to In-Stat, the number of HDMI devices sold was 5 million in 2004, 17.4 million in 2005, 63 million in 2006, and 143 million in 2007. HDMI has become the de facto standard for HDTVs, and according to In-Stat, around 90% of digital televisions in 2007 included HDMI. In-Stat has estimated that 229 million HDMI devices were sold in 2008. On April 8, 2008, there were over 850 consumer electronics and PC companies that had adopted the HDMI specification (HDMI adopters). On January 7, 2009, HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that HDMI had reached an installed base of over 600 million HDMI devices. In-Stat estimated that 394 million HDMI devices would sell in 2009 and that all digital televisions by the end of 2009 would have at least one HDMI input.

On January 28, 2008, In-Stat reported that shipments of HDMI were expected to exceed those of DVI in 2008, driven primarily by the consumer electronics market.

In 2008, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; awarded a Technical Excellence Award in the Home Theater category for an &quot;innovation that has changed the world&quot; to the CEC portion of the HDMI specification. Ten companies were given a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for their development of HDMI by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on January 7, 2009.

On October 25, 2011, the HDMI Forum was established by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate in the development of the HDMI specification. All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies that serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is made up of 11 companies who are elected every two years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification take place in the HDMI Forum and are built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification. Also on the same day HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI-enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. From October 25, 2011, all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum.

On January 8, 2013, HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,300 HDMI adopters and that over 3 billion HDMI devices had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. The day also marked the 10th anniversary of the release of the first HDMI specification.

, nearly 10 billion HDMI devices had been sold.

==Specifications==
The HDMI specification defines the protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical requirements of the standard. The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165 MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340 MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25 MHz to 340 MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25 MHz to 680 MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with pixel rates below 25 MHz (like 480i at 13.5 MHz) are transmitted over TMDS links using a pixel-repetition scheme.

===Audio/video===
HDMI uses the Consumer Technology Association/Electronic Industries Alliance 861 standards. HDMI 1.0 to HDMI 1.2a uses the EIA/CEA-861-B video standard, HDMI 1.3 uses the CEA-861-D video standard, and HDMI 1.4 uses the CEA-861-E video standard. The CEA-861-E document defines &quot;video formats and waveforms; colorimetry and quantization; transport of compressed and uncompressed LPCM audio; carriage of auxiliary data; and implementations of the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) Enhanced Extended Display Identification Data Standard (E-EDID)&quot;. On July 15, 2013, the CEA announced the publication of CEA-861-F, a standard that can be used by video interfaces such as DVI, HDMI, and LVDS. CEA-861-F adds the ability to transmit several Ultra HD video formats and additional color spaces.

To ensure baseline compatibility between different HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability to use the color space and higher color depths (&quot;deep color&quot;) is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces that can be used by HDMI are ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709-5 and IEC 61966-2-4.

For digital audio, if an HDMI device has audio, it is required to implement the baseline format: stereo (uncompressed) PCM. Other formats are optional, with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16 bits, 20 bits, or 24 bits, with sample rates of 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz, or 192kHz. HDMI also carries any IEC 61937-compliant compressed audio stream, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, and up to 8 channels of one-bit DSD audio (used on Super Audio CDs) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD. With version 1.3, HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. As with the video, audio capability is optional. Audio return channel (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard. &quot;Return&quot; refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent &quot;upstream&quot; to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver. An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial/satellite broadcast, or has a video source built in, sends the audio &quot;upstream&quot; to the AV receiver.

The HDMI standard was not designed to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to appear on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, as there is no line 21 VBI in that format.

===Communication channels===

HDMI has three physically separate communication channels, which are the VESA DDC, TMDS and the optional CEC. HDMI 1.4 added ARC and HEC.

====Display Data Channel (DDC)====

The Display Data Channel (DDC) is a VESA standard communications channel based on the I2C bus specification. HDMI specifically requires the device implement the Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC), which is used by the HDMI source device to read the E-EDID data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio/video formats it can take. HDMI requires that the E-DDC implement I2C standard mode speed () and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed ().

I2C address 0x74 on the DDC channel is actively used for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP).

====Transition-minimized differential signaling (TMDS)====
Transition-minimized differential signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the video data period, the data island period and the control period. During the video data period, the pixels of an active video line are transmitted. During the data island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The control period occurs between video and data island periods.

Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit characters that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that differs from the original IBM form for the video data period and 2b/10b encoding for the control period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the data island period. Each data island period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit packet header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes the contents of the packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each data island period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the general control packet and the gamut metadata packet. The general control packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and color depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The gamut metadata packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.

====Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)====

Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.

It is a one-wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.

====HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel====
Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a high-speed bidirectional data communication link (HEC) and the ability to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused &quot;Reserved&quot; pin (called HEAC+) and the &quot;Hot Plug Detect&quot; pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.

Audio Return Channel (ARC)

ARC is an audio link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V receiver or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV is the one that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV must be routed by another cable, typically TOSLink or RCA, into the speaker system.
HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC)

HDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video, audio, and data streams into a single HDMI cable, and the HEC feature enables IP-based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional Ethernet communication at . The physical layer of the Ethernet implementation uses a hybrid to simultaneously send and receive attenuated 100BASE-TX-type signals through a single twisted pair.

===Compatibility with DVI===
HDMI is backward compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A or dual-link DVI). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used, so there is no loss of video quality.

From a user&#x27;s perspective, an HDMI display can be driven by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an overlapping minimum set of allowed resolutions and frame-buffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case, a DVI-D monitor has the same level of basic interoperability unless content protection with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) interferes—or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space  instead of RGB, which is not possible in DVI. An HDMI source, such as a Blu-ray player, may require an HDCP-compliant display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication is that there is a small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.

Any DVI-to-HDMI adapter can function as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa). Typically, the only limitation is the gender of the adapter&#x27;s connectors and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.

Features specific to HDMI, such as remote-control and audio transport, are not available in devices that use legacy DVI-D signalling. However, many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector (e.g., ATI 3000-series and NVIDIA GTX 200-series video cards), and some multimedia displays may accept HDMI (including audio) over a DVI input. Exact capabilities beyond basic compatibility vary. Adapters are generally bi-directional.

===Content protection (HDCP)===

High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a newer form of digital rights management (DRM). Intel created the original technology to make sure that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group.

HDMI can use HDCP to encrypt the signal if required by the source device. Content Scramble System (CSS), Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) and Advanced Access Content System (AACS) require the use of HDCP on HDMI when playing back encrypted DVD Video, DVD Audio, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The HDCP repeater bit controls the authentication and switching/distribution of an HDMI signal. According to HDCP Specification 1.2 (beginning with HDMI CTS 1.3a), any system that implements HDCP must do so in a fully compliant manner. HDCP testing that was previously only a requirement for optional tests such as the &quot;Simplay HD&quot; testing program is now part of the requirements for HDMI compliance. HDCP accommodates up to 127 connected devices with up to 7 levels, using a combination of sources, sinks and repeaters. A simple example of this is several HDMI devices connected to an HDMI AV receiver that is connected to an HDMI display.

Devices called HDCP strippers can remove the HDCP information from the video signal so the video can play on non-HDCP-compliant displays, though a fair use and non-disclosure form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use.

===Connectors===

There are five HDMI connector types. Type A/B are defined in the HDMI 1.0 specification, type C is defined in the HDMI 1.3 specification, and type D/E are defined in the HDMI 1.4 specification.

; Type A; Standard: The plug (male) connector outside dimensions are 13.9 mm × 4.45 mm, and the receptacle (female) connector inside dimensions are 14 mm × 4.55 mm. There are 19 pins, with bandwidth to carry all SDTV, EDTV, HDTV, UHD, and 4K modes. It is electrically compatible with single-link DVI-D.

; Type B; Dual-link: This connector is 21.2 mm × 4.45 mm and has 29 pins, carrying six differential pairs instead of three, for use with very high-resolution displays such as WQUXGA (3840×2400). It is electrically compatible with dual-link DVI-D, but has not yet been used in any products. With the introduction of HDMI 1.3, the maximum bandwidth of single-link HDMI exceeded that of dual-link DVI-D. As of HDMI 1.4, the pixel clock rate crossover frequency from single to dual-link has not been defined.

; Type C; Mini :This Mini connector is smaller than the type A plug, measuring 10.42 mm × 2.42 mm but has the same 19-pin configuration. It is intended for portable devices. The differences are that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield, the DDC/CEC Ground is assigned to pin 13 instead of pin 17, the CEC is assigned to pin 14 instead of pin 13, and the reserved pin is 17 instead of pin 14. The type C Mini connector can be connected to a type A connector using a type A-to-type C cable.
; Type D; Micro: This Micro connector shrinks the connector size to something resembling a micro-USB connector, measuring only 5.83 mm × 2.20 mm For comparison, a micro-USB connector is 6.85 mm × 1.8 mm and a USB type-A connector is 11.5 mm × 4.5 mm. It keeps the standard 19 pins of types A and C, but the pin assignment is different from both.

; Type E; Automotive: The Automotive Connection System has a locking tab to keep the cable from vibrating loose and a shell to help prevent moisture and dirt from interfering with the signals.

The HDMI alternate mode lets a user connect the reversible USB-C connector with the HDMI source devices (mobile, tablet, laptop). This cable connects to video display/sink devices using any of the native HDMI connectors. This is an HDMI cable, in this case a USB-C to HDMI cable.

===Cables===
An HDMI cable is composed of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance of the order of 100 Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).

Although no maximum length for an HDMI cable is specified, signal attenuation (dependent on the cable&#x27;s construction quality and conducting materials) limits usable lengths in practice and certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond 13 m. HDMI 1.3 defines two cable categories: Category 1-certified cables, which have been tested at 74.25 MHz (which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and 1080i60), and Category 2-certified cables, which have been tested at 340 MHz (which would include resolutions such as 1080p60 and 4K30). Category 1 HDMI cables are marketed as &quot;Standard&quot; and Category 2 HDMI cables as &quot;High Speed&quot;. This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October 17, 2008. Category 1 and 2 cables can either meet the required parameter specifications for inter-pair skew, far-end crosstalk, attenuation and differential impedance, or they can meet the required non-equalized/equalized eye diagram requirements. A cable of about can be manufactured to Category 1 specifications easily and inexpensively by using 28 AWG (0.081 mm2) conductors. With better quality construction and materials, including 24 AWG (0.205 mm2) conductors, an HDMI cable can reach lengths of up to . Many HDMI cables under 5 meters of length that were made before the HDMI 1.3 specification can work as Category 2 cables, but only Category 2-tested cables are guaranteed to work for Category 2 purposes.

As of the HDMI 1.4 specification, the following cable types are defined for HDMI in general:

* Standard HDMI Cableup to 1080i and 720p
* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet
* Standard Automotive HDMI Cable
* High Speed HDMI Cable1080p, 4K 30Hz, 3D and deep color
* High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet

A new certification program was introduced in October 2015 to certify that cables work at the maximum bandwidth of the HDMI 2.0 specification. In addition to expanding the set of cable testing requirements, the certification program introduces an EMI test to ensure cables minimize interference with wireless signals. These cables are marked with an anti-counterfeiting authentication label and are defined as:
* Premium High Speed HDMI Cable
* Premium High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet

In conjunction with the HDMI 2.1 specification, a third category of cable was announced on January 4, 2017, called &quot;48G&quot;. Also known as Category 3 HDMI or &quot;Ultra High Speed&quot; HDMI, the cable is designed to support the bandwidth of HDMI 2.1, supporting 4K, 5K, 8K and 10K at 120Hz. The cable is backwards compatible with the earlier HDMI devices, using existing HDMI type A, C and D connectors, and includes HDMI Ethernet.
* Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable (48G Cable)4K, 5K, 8K and 10K at 120Hz

===Extenders===
An HDMI extender is a single device (or pair of devices) powered with an external power source or with the 5V DC from the HDMI source. Long cables can cause instability of HDCP and blinking on the screen, due to the weakened DDC signal that HDCP requires. HDCP DDC signals must be multiplexed with TMDS video signals to comply with HDCP requirements for HDMI extenders based on a single Category 5/Category 6 cable. Several companies offer amplifiers, equalizers and repeaters that can string several standard HDMI cables together. Active HDMI cables use electronics within the cable to boost the signal and allow for HDMI cables of up to ; those based on HDBaseT can extend to 100 meters; HDMI extenders that are based on dual Category 5/Category 6 cable can extend HDMI to ; while HDMI extenders based on optical fiber can extend HDMI to .

===Licensing===

The HDMI specification is not an open standard; manufacturers need to be licensed by HDMI LA in order to implement HDMI in any product or component. Companies that are licensed by HDMI LA are known as HDMI Adopters.

DVI is the only interface that does not require a license for interfacing HDMI.

====HDMI adopters====

While earlier versions of HDMI specs are available to the public for download, only adopters have access to the latest standards (HDMI 1.4b/2.1). Only adopters have access to the compliance test specification (CTS) that is used for compliance and certification. Compliance testing is required before any HDMI product can be legally sold.

* Adopters have IP rights under Adopter Agreement.
* Adopters receive the right to use HDMI logos and TMs on their products and marketing materials.
* Adopters are listed on the HDMI website.
* Products from adopters are listed and marketed in the official HDMI product finder database.
* Adopters receive more exposure through combined marketing, such as the annual HDMI Developers Conference and technology seminars.

====HDMI fee structure====

There are two annual fee structures associated with being an HDMI adopter:

* High-volume (more than 10,000 units) HDMI Adopter Agreement per year.
* Low-volume (10,000 units or fewer) HDMI Adopter Agreement plus a flat per unit administration fee.

The annual fee is due upon the execution of the Adopter Agreement, and must be paid on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter.

The royalty fee structure is the same for all volumes. The following variable per-unit royalty is device-based and not dependent on number of ports, chips or connectors:

* for each end-user licensed product
* if the HDMI logo is used on the product and promotional material, the per-unit fee drops from to .
* if HDCP is implemented and HDMI logo is used, the per-unit fee drops from to .

Use of HDMI logo requires compliance testing. Adopters need to license HDCP separately.

The HDMI royalty is only payable on licensed products that will be sold on a stand-alone basis (i.e., that are not incorporated into another licensed product that is subject to an HDMI royalty). For example, if a cable or IC is sold to an adopter who then includes it in a television subject to a royalty, then the cable or IC maker would not pay a royalty, and the television manufacturer would pay the royalty on the final product. If the cable is sold directly to consumers, then the cable would be subject to a royalty.

==Versions==

HDMI devices and cables are designed based on the HDMI Specification, a document published by HDMI Licensing (through version 1.4b) or the HDMI Forum (from version 2.0 onward). The HDMI Specification defines the minimum baseline requirements that all HDMI devices must adhere to for interoperability, as well as a large set of optional features that HDMI devices may support. The specification is periodically updated to add clarifications or define new capabilities that HDMI devices may implement. Each new version of the specification expands the list of possible features, but does not mandate support for new features in all devices or establish any &quot;classes&quot; of HDMI products which must support certain capabilities. Version numbers do not refer to classes or tiers of products with certain levels of feature support, and as such, HDMI specification &quot;version numbers&quot; are not a method of describing support for specific features or describing the capabilities of an HDMI device or cable.

In 2009, HDMI Licensing banned the use of &quot;version numbers&quot; in labeling HDMI products. Instead, HDMI devices should explicitly declare which features and capabilities they support. For HDMI cables, a speed rating system was established since feature support is not dependent on the cable (apart from inline Ethernet and ARC); the cable only affects the maximum possible speed of the connection. HDMI cables should be labeled with the appropriate speed certification (i.e. Standard Speed, High Speed, or Ultra High Speed), not a &quot;version number&quot;.

===Version 1.0===
HDMI 1.0 was released on December 9, 2002, and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz ( bandwidth per link), the same as DVI. It defines two connectors called type A and type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses TMDS encoding for video transmission, giving it of video bandwidth ( or at 60Hz) and 8-channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 requires support for RGB video, with optional support for 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device has support for on other interfaces). Color depth of 10bpc (30bit/px) or 12bpc (36bit/px) is allowed when using 4:2:2 subsampling, but only 8bpc (24bit/px) color depth is permitted when using RGB or 4:4:4. Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces are supported. HDMI 1.0 allows only specific pre-defined video formats, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and some additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources/sinks must also be capable of sending/receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.

===Version 1.1===
HDMI 1.1 was released on May 20, 2004, and added support for DVD-Audio.

===Version 1.2===
HDMI 1.2 was released on August 8, 2005, and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120 Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would not be required to support output.

HDMI 1.2a was released on December 14, 2005 and fully specifies Consumer Electronic Control (CEC) features, command sets and CEC compliance tests.

===Version 1.3===

HDMI 1.3 was released on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (). Like previous versions, it uses TMDS encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of (sufficient for at 144Hz or at 75Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, in addition to the ITU-R BT.601 and BT.709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new HDMI type C &quot;Mini&quot; connector for portable devices.

HDMI 1.3a was released on November 10, 2006, and had cable and sink modifications for HDMI type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits. It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD. HDMI 1.3a is available to download free of charge, after registration.

===Version 1.4===
HDMI 1.4 was released on June 5, 2009, and first came to market after Q2 of 2009. Retaining the bandwidth of the previous version, HDMI 1.4 defined standardized timings to use for 40962160 at 24Hz, 38402160 at 24, 25, and 30Hz, and added explicit support for 19201080 at 120Hz with CTA-861 timings. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) that accommodates a Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.

HDMI 1.4a was released on March 4, 2010, and added two mandatory 3D formats for broadcast content, which was deferred with HDMI 1.4 pending the direction of the 3D broadcast market. HDMI 1.4a has defined mandatory 3D formats for broadcast, game, and movie content. HDMI 1.4a requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24, side-by-side horizontal at either 1080i50 or 1080i60, and top-and-bottom at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24.

HDMI 1.4b was released on October 11, 2011, containing only minor clarifications to the 1.4a document. HDMI 1.4b is the last version of the standard that HDMI LA is responsible for. All later versions of the HDMI Specification are produced by the HDMI Forum, created on October 25, 2011.

===Version 2.0===
HDMI 2.0, referred to by some manufacturers as HDMI UHD, was released on September 4, 2013.

HDMI 2.0 increases the maximum bandwidth to . HDMI 2.0 uses TMDS encoding for video transmission like previous versions, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of . This enables HDMI 2.0 to carry 4K video at 60 Hz with 24 bit/px color depth. Other features of HDMI 2.0 include support for the Rec. 2020 color space, up to 32 audio channels, up to 1536 kHz audio sample frequency, dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen, up to four audio streams, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 25 fps 3D formats, support for the 21:9 aspect ratio, dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams, the HE-AAC and DRA audio standards, improved 3D capability, and additional CEC functions.

HDMI 2.0a was released on April 8, 2015, and added support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) video with static metadata.

HDMI 2.0b was released March 2016. HDMI 2.0b initially supported the same HDR10 standard as HDMI 2.0a as specified in the CTA-861.3 specification. In December 2016 additional support for HDR Video transport was added to HDMI 2.0b in the CTA-861-G specification, which extends the static metadata signaling to include hybrid log–gamma (HLG).

===Version 2.1===
HDMI 2.1 was officially announced by the HDMI Forum on January4, 2017, and was released on November 28, 2017. It adds support for higher resolutions and higher refresh rates, including 4K 120Hz and 8K 60Hz. HDMI 2.1 also introduces a new HDMI cable category called &quot;Ultra High Speed&quot; (referred to as &quot;48G&quot; during development), which certifies cables at the new higher speeds that these formats require. Ultra High Speed HDMI cables are backwards compatible with older HDMI devices, and older cables are compatible with new HDMI 2.1 devices, though the full bandwidth is only supported with the new cables.

Some systems may not be able to use HDMI 2.1 because the HDMI Forum is preventing its use in open source implementations (such as Linux open source drivers). Users of those systems may need to use DisplayPort instead to access high resolutions and speeds.

The following features were added to the HDMI 2.1 Specification:

* Maximum supported format is 10K at 120Hz
* Dynamic HDR for specifying HDR metadata on a scene-by-scene or even a frame-by-frame basis
** Note: While HDMI 2.1 did standardize transport of dynamic HDR metadata over HDMI, in actuality it only formalized dynamic metadata interfaces already utilized by Dolby Vision and HDR10+ in HDMI 2.0, which is why neither Dolby Vision nor HDR10+ require HDMI 2.1 to function properly.
* Display Stream Compression (DSC) 1.2 is used for video formats higher than 8K with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling
* High Frame Rate (HFR) for 4K, 8K, and 10K, which adds support for refresh rates up to 120Hz
* Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) for object-based audio formats such as Dolby Atmos and 
* Enhanced refresh rate and latency reduction features:
** Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) reduces or eliminates lag, stutter and frame tearing for more fluid motion in games
** Quick Media Switching (QMS) for movies and video eliminates the delay that can result in blank screens before content begins to be displayed
** Quick Frame Transport (QFT) reduces latency by bursting individual pictures across the HDMI link as fast as possible when the link&#x27;s hardware supports more bandwidth than the minimum amount needed for the resolution and frame rate of the content. With QFT, individual pictures arrive earlier and some hardware blocks can be fully powered off for longer periods of time between pictures to reduce heat generation and extend battery life.
* Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)When a display device supports the option to either optimize its pixel processing for best latency or best pixel processing, ALLM allows the current HDMI source device to automatically select, based on its better understanding of the nature of its own content, which mode the user would most likely prefer.

Video formats that require more bandwidth than (4K 60Hz 8bpc RGB), such as 4K 60Hz 10bpc (HDR), 4K 120Hz, and 8K 60Hz, may require the new &quot;Ultra High Speed&quot; or &quot;Ultra High Speed with Ethernet&quot; cables. HDMI 2.1&#x27;s other new features are supported with existing HDMI cables.

The increase in maximum bandwidth is achieved by increasing both the bitrate of the data channels and the number of channels. Previous HDMI versions use three data channels (each operating at up to in HDMI 2.0, or up to in HDMI 1.4), with an additional channel for the TMDS clock signal, which runs at a fraction of the data channel speed (one tenth the speed, or up to 340MHz, for signaling rates up to ; one fortieth the speed, or up to 150MHz, for signaling rates between 3.4 and ). HDMI 2.1 doubles the signaling rate of the data channels to . The structure of the data has been changed to use a new packet-based format with an embedded clock signal, which allows what was formerly the TMDS clock channel to be used as a fourth data channel instead, increasing the signaling rate across that channel to 12Gbit/s as well. These changes increase the aggregate bandwidth from (3 × ) to (4 × ), a 2.66× improvement in bandwidth. In addition, the data is transmitted more efficiently by using a 16b/18b encoding scheme, which uses a larger percentage of the bandwidth for data rather than DC balancing compared to the TMDS scheme used by previous versions (88.% compared to 80%). This, in combination with the 2.66× bandwidth, raises the maximum data rate of HDMI 2.1 from to 42.Gbit/s. Subtracting overhead for FEC, the usable data rate is approximately , around 2.92× the data rate of HDMI 2.0.

The bandwidth provided by HDMI 2.1 is enough for 8K resolution at approximately 50Hz, with 8bpc RGB or 4:4:4 color. To achieve even higher formats, HDMI 2.1 can use Display Stream Compression (DSC) with a compression ratio of up to . Using DSC, formats up to 8K () 120Hz or 10K () 100Hz at 8bpc RGB/4:4:4 are possible. Using with 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in combination with DSC can allow for even higher formats.
HDMI 2.1a was released on February 15, 2022, and added support for Source-Based Tone Mapping (SBTM).

HDMI 2.1b was released on August 10, 2023.

===Version 2.2===
HDMI 2.2 was announced on January 6, 2025. It will be released in the first half of 2025. The maximum allowed bit rate is increased to .

===Version comparison===

====Main specifications====


====Refresh frequency limits for common resolutions====

The maximum limits for TMDS transmission are calculated using standard data rate calculations. For FRL transmission, the limits are calculated using the capacity computation algorithm provided by the HDMI Specification. All calculations assume uncompressed RGB video with CVT-RB v2 timing. Maximum limits may differ if compression (i.e. DSC) or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling are used.

Display manufacturers may also use non-standard blanking intervals (a Vendor-Specific Timing Format as defined in the HDMI Specification) rather than CVT-RB v2 to achieve even higher frequencies when bandwidth is a constraint. The refresh frequencies in the below table do not represent the absolute maximum limit of each interface, but rather an estimate based on a modern standardized timing formula. The minimum blanking intervals (and therefore the exact maximum frequency that can be achieved) will depend on the display and how many secondary data packets it requires, and therefore will differ from model to model.




====Refresh frequency limits for standard video====
HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are restricted to transmitting only certain video formats, defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself. HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit). Formats that are not supported by the HDMI Specification (i.e., no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), but the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish which formats are or are not permitted. Video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be transmitted and displayed.

Individual products may have heavier limitations than those listed below, since HDMI devices are not required to support the maximum bandwidth of the HDMI version that they implement. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that a display will support the refresh rates listed in this table, even if the display has the required HDMI version.

Uncompressed 8bpc (24bit/px) color depth and RGB or 4:4:4 color format are assumed on this table except where noted.


====Refresh frequency limits for HDR10 video====
HDR10 requires 10bpc (30bit/px) color depth, which uses 25% more bandwidth than standard 8bpc video.

Uncompressed 10bpc color depth and RGB or 4:4:4 color format are assumed on this table except where noted.


====Feature support====

The features defined in the HDMI Specification that an HDMI device may implement are listed below. For historical interest, the version of the HDMI Specification in which the feature was first added is also listed. All features of the HDMI Specification are optional; HDMI devices may implement any combination of these features.

Although the &quot;HDMI version numbers&quot; are commonly misused as a way of indicating that a device supports certain features, this notation has no official meaning and is considered improper by HDMI Licensing. There is no officially-defined correlation between features supported by a device and any claimed &quot;version numbers&quot;, as version numbers refer to historical editions of the HDMI Specification document, not to particular classes of HDMI devices. Manufacturers are forbidden from describing their devices using HDMI version numbers, and are required to identify support for features by listing explicit support for them, but the HDMI forum has received criticism for lack of enforcement of these policies.

====Display Stream Compression====

&quot;Display Stream Compression&quot; (DSC) is a VESA-developed video compression algorithm designed to enable increased display resolutions and frame rates over existing physical interfaces, and make devices smaller and lighter, with longer battery life.

==Applications==

===Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD players===
Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, introduced in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form. This capability allows for an AV receiver with the necessary decoder to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 can transfer Blu-ray discs at full video quality.

The HDMI 1.4 specification (released in 2009) added support for 3D video and is used by all Blu-ray 3D compatible players.

The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) spokespersons have stated (Sept. 2014 at IFA show in Berlin, Germany) that the Blu-ray, Ultra HD players, and 4K discs are expected to be available starting in the second half to 2015. It is anticipated that such Blu-ray UHD players will be required to include a HDMI 2.0 output that supports HDCP 2.2.

Blu-ray permits secondary audio decoding, whereby the disc content can tell the player to mix multiple audio sources together before final output. Some Blu-ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio codecs internally and can output LPCM audio over HDMI. Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection, and as long as the AV receiver implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements HDCP, the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI 1.3 bitstream output. Some low-cost AV receivers, such as the Onkyo TX-SR506, do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as &quot;HDMI pass through&quot; devices. Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI 1.4 inputs and outputs with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu-ray Discs and other HD video sources. During 2014 several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one, or multiple, HDMI 2.0 inputs along with a HDMI 2.0 output(s). However, not until 2015 did most major manufacturers of AV receivers also support HDCP 2.2 as needed to support certain high quality UHD video sources, such as Blu-ray UHD players.

===Digital cameras and camcorders===
Most consumer camcorders, as well as many digital cameras, are equipped with a mini-HDMI connector (type C connector).

Some cameras also have 4K capability,
although cameras capable of HD video often include an HDMI interface for playback or even live preview, the image processor and the video processor of cameras usable for uncompressed video must be able to deliver the full image resolution at the specified frame rate in real time without any missing frames causing jitter. Therefore, usable uncompressed video out of HDMI is often called &quot;clean HDMI&quot;.

===Personal computers===

Personal computer (PCs) with a DVI interface are capable of video output to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output, depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel&#x27;s motherboard chipsets since the 945G and NVIDIA&#x27;s GeForce 8200/8300 motherboard chipsets are capable of 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192 kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel&#x27;s WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96 kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.

Even with an HDMI output, a computer may not be able to produce signals that implement HDCP, Microsoft&#x27;s Protected Video Path, or Microsoft&#x27;s Protected Audio Path. Several early graphic cards were labelled as &quot;HDCP-enabled&quot; but did not have the hardware needed for HDCP; this included some graphic cards based on the ATI X1600 chipset and certain models of the NVIDIA Geforce 7900 series. The first computer monitors that could process HDCP were released in 2005; by February 2006 a dozen different models had been released. The Protected Video Path was enabled in graphic cards that had HDCP capability, since it was required for output of Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD video. In comparison, the Protected Audio Path was required only if a lossless audio bitstream (such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA) was output. Uncompressed LPCM audio, however, does not require a Protected Audio Path, and software programs such as PowerDVD and WinDVD can decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA and output it as LPCM. A limitation is that if the computer does not implement a Protected Audio Path, the audio must be downsampled to 16-bit 48 kHz but can still output at up to 8 channels. No graphic cards were released in 2008 that implemented the Protected Audio Path.

The Asus Xonar HDAV1.3 became the first HDMI sound card that implemented the Protected Audio Path and could both bitstream and decode lossless audio (Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA), although bitstreaming is only available if using the ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre software. It has an HDMI 1.3 input/output, and Asus says that it can work with most video cards on the market.

In September 2009, AMD announced the ATI Radeon HD 5000 series video cards, which have HDMI 1.3 output (deep color, xvYCC wide gamut capability and high bit rate audio), 8-channel LPCM over HDMI, and an integrated HD audio controller with a Protected Audio Path that allows bitstream output over HDMI for AAC, Dolby AC-3, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio formats. The ATI Radeon HD 5870 released in September 2009 is the first video card that allows bitstream output over HDMI for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. The AMD Radeon HD 6000 series implements HDMI 1.4a. The AMD Radeon HD 7000 series implements HDMI 1.4b.

In December 2010, it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including Intel, AMD, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and LG would stop using LVDS (actually, FPD-Link) from 2013 and legacy DVI and VGA connectors from 2015, replacing them with DisplayPort and HDMI.

On August 27, 2012, Asus announced a new monitor that produces its native resolution of 2560×1440 via HDMI 1.4.

On September 18, 2014, Nvidia launched GeForce GTX 980 and GTX 970 (with GM204 chip) with HDMI 2.0 support. On January 22, 2015, GeForce GTX 960 (with GM206 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support. On March 17, 2015, GeForce GTX TITAN X (GM200) launched with HDMI 2.0 support. On June 1, 2015, GeForce GTX 980 Ti (with GM200 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support. On August 20, 2015, GeForce GTX 950 (with GM206 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support.

On May 6, 2016, Nvidia launched the GeForce GTX 1080 (GP104 GPU) with HDMI 2.0b support.

On September 1, 2020, Nvidia launched the GeForce RTX 30 series, the world&#x27;s first discrete graphics cards with support for the full bandwidth with Display Stream Compression 1.2 of HDMI 2.1.

===Gaming consoles===
Beginning with the seventh generation of video game consoles, most consoles support HDMI. Video game consoles that support HDMI include the Xbox 360 (except most pre-2007 models) (1.2a), Xbox One (1.4b), Xbox One S (2.0a), Xbox One X (2.0b), PlayStation 3 (1.3a), PlayStation 4 (1.4b), PlayStation 4 Pro (2.0a), Wii U (1.4a), Nintendo Switch (1.4b), Nintendo Switch (OLED model) (2.0a), Xbox Series X and Series S (2.1), and PlayStation 5 (2.1).

===Tablet computers===

Some tablet computers implement HDMI using Micro-HDMI (type D) port, while others like the Eee Pad Transformer implement the standard using mini-HDMI (type C) ports. All iPad models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple&#x27;s Lightning connector to a standard HDMI (type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that could adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle adds HDMI compatibility. Some tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.

===Mobile phones===
Many mobile phones can produce an output of HDMI video via a micro-HDMI connector, SlimPort, MHL or other adapter.

===Legacy compatibility===
HDMI can only be used with older analog-only devices (using connections such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) by means of a digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, but it is important to distinguish these &quot;active&quot; converter cables from &quot;passive&quot; HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don&#x27;t include any electronics). The passive cables are &quot;only&quot; useful if a user has a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.

==HDMI Alternate Mode for USB type-C==
The HDMI Alternate Mode for USB-C allows HDMI-enabled sources with a USB-C connector to directly connect to standard HDMI display devices, without requiring an adapter. The standard was released in September 2016, and supports all HDMI 1.4b features such as video resolutions up to Ultra HD 30 Hz and CEC. Previously, the similar DisplayPort Alternate Mode could be used to connect to HDMI displays from USB type-C sources, but where in that case active adapters were required to convert from DisplayPort to HDMI, HDMI Alternate Mode connects to the display natively.

The Alternate Mode reconfigures the four SuperSpeed differential pairs present in USB-C to carry the three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the Hot Plug Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD pin). As there are not enough reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the DDC clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CECthese three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the USB Power Delivery 2.0 (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire. This is possible because the cable is electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.

As stated at CES in January 2023, HDMI Alternate Mode for USB Type-C is no longer being updated as there are no known products using this protocol, reducing its relevance in the current market. This will reduce consumer confusion as DisplayPort Alternate Mode is the primary video protocol of choice over USB-C.

==Relationship with DisplayPort==

The DisplayPort audio/video interface was introduced in May 2006. Historically, HDMI Licensing LLC was publicly dismissive of DisplayPort&#x27;s position in the industry, with its president stating in a 2009 interview that &quot;there are certainly some PCs that have 
DisplayPort connectors on them, but these are niche applications that have not taken hold in the market.&quot;

In recent years, DisplayPort connectors have become a common feature of premium products—displays, desktop computers, and video cards; most of the companies producing DisplayPort equipment are in the computer sector. The DisplayPort website states that DisplayPort is expected to complement HDMI, but 100% of HD and UHD TVs had HDMI connectivity. DisplayPort supported some advanced features which are useful for multimedia content creators and gamers (e.g., 5K, Adaptive-Sync), which was the reason most GPUs have DisplayPort. These features were added to the official HDMI specification slightly later, but with the introduction of HDMI 2.1, these gaps are already leveled off (e.g., VRR / Variable Refresh Rate).

DisplayPort uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential pair lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream. DisplayPort 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable refresh rate (FreeSync), and Dual-mode transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4. Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to with the new HBR3 mode featuring per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 added Display Stream Compression (DSC), support for the BT.2020 color space, and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata. Revision 1.4a was published in April 2018, updating DisplayPort&#x27;s DSC implementation from 1.2 to 1.2a. Revision 2.0 increased overall bandwidth from 25.92 to , enabling increased resolutions and refresh rates, increasing the resolutions and refresh rates with HDR support, and other related improvements. Revision 2.1 was published in October 2022, incorporating the new DP40 and DP80 cable certifications, which require proper operation at the UHBR10 (40Gbit/s) and UHBR20 (80Gbit/s) speeds introduced in version 2.0, and a bandwidth management feature to enable DisplayPort tunnelling to coexist with other I/O data traffic more efficiently over a USB4/USB Type-C connection.

The DisplayPort features an adapter detection mechanism enabling dual-mode operation and the transmission of TMDS signals allowing the conversion to DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using a passive adapter. The same external connector is used for both protocolswhen a DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TMDS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.

The USB 3.1 type-C connector is increasingly the standard video connector, replacing legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI, and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB type-C cables or type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters that actively convert from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB type-C specification was published in 2015. USB type-C chipsets are not required to include Dual-mode, so passive DP-HDMI adapters do not work with type-C sources. A specification for &quot;HDMI Alternate Mode for USB type-C&quot; was released in 2016, but was discontinued in 2023, with HDMI Licensing Administration stating they knew of no adapter having ever been produced.

DisplayPort is royalty-free, though patent pool administrator Via LA attempts to collect a $0.20 per-device charge for a bulk license to patents it regards as essential to the DisplayPort specification, while HDMI has an annual fee of US$10,000 and a per unit royalty rate of between $0.04 and $0.15.

HDMI has had a few advantages over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals since its first generation (DisplayPort 1.3, introduced in 2014, is the earliest DisplayPort generation which can carry CEC signals).

==Relationship with MHL==

Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an adaptation of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.

MHL pares down the three TMDS channels in a standard HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins. This lets existing connectors in mobile devicessuch as micro-USBbe used, avoiding the need for additional dedicated video output sockets. The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.

In addition to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL-enabled HDMI port, power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter.

Like HDMI, MHL defines a USB-C Alternate Mode to support the MHL standard over USB-C connections.

Version 1.0 supported 720p/1080i 60 Hz (RGB/4:4:4 pixel encoding) with a bandwidth of . Versions 1.3 and 2.0 added support for 1080p 60 Hz ( 4:2:2) with a bandwidth of in PackedPixel mode. Version 3.0 increased the bandwidth to to support Ultra HD (3840 × 2160) 30 Hz video, and also changed from being frame-based, like HDMI, to packet-based.

The fourth version, superMHL, increased bandwidth by operating over multiple TMDS differential pairs (up to a total of six) allowing a maximum of . The six lanes are supported over a reversible 32-pin superMHL connector, while four lanes are supported over USB-C Alternate Mode (only a single lane is supported over micro-USB/HDMI). Display Stream Compression (DSC) is used to allow up to 8K Ultra HD (7680 × 4320) 120 Hz HDR video, and to support Ultra HD 60 Hz video over a single lane.

<doc id="537458" wikidata="Q743127" url="?curid=537458" title="List of artificial objects on the Moon">
<text>This is a partial list of artificial materials left on the Moon, many during the missions of the Apollo program. The table below does not include lesser Apollo mission artificial objects, such as a hammer and other tools, retroreflectors, Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages, or the commemorative, artistic, and personal objects left by the twelve Apollo astronauts, such as the United States flags, the commemorative plaques attached to the ladders of the six Apollo Lunar Modules, the silver astronaut pin left by Alan Bean in honor of Clifton C. Williams whom he replaced, the Bible left by David Scott, the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; statuette and memorial plaque placed by the crew of Apollo 15, the Apollo 11 goodwill messages disc, or the golf balls Alan Shepard hit during an Apollo 14 moonwalk.

Five S-IVB third stages of Saturn V rockets from the Apollo program crashed into the Moon, and are the heaviest human-made objects on the lunar surface. Humans have left over of material on the Moon. Besides the 2019 Chang&#x27;e 4 and SLIM missions, the only artificial objects on the Moon that are still in use are the retroreflectors for the Lunar Laser Ranging experiments left there by the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 astronauts, Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander, and by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 missions.

Objects at greater than 90 degrees east or west are on the far side of the Moon, including Ranger 4, Lunar Orbiter 1, Lunar Orbiter 2, Lunar Orbiter 3, Chang&#x27;e 4 lander and &quot;Yutu-2&quot; rover.

Because of increasing numbers of missions to and objects at the Moon, a global registry of lunar activities has been proposed in 2023 by the Open Lunar Foundation.

<text>Giovanna Carmella Babbo (September 22, 1930 – February 20, 2022), known professionally as Joni James, was an American singer of traditional pop.

==Biography==
Giovanna Carmella Babbo was born to an Italian-American family in Chicago, Illinois, on September 22, 1930, as one of six children supported by her widowed mother. As an adolescent, she studied drama and ballet, and on graduating from Bowen High School, located in the South Chicago neighborhood, went with a local dance group on a tour of Canada. She then took a job as a chorus girl in the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago.

After doing a fill-in in Indiana, she decided to pursue a singing career, and picked the stage name Joni James at the urging of her managers. Some executives at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) spotted her in a television commercial, and she was signed by MGM in 1952. Her first hit, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Believe Me?&quot;, sold over two million copies. She had a number of hits following that one, including &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; (a cover of Hank Williams&#x27; hit) and &quot;Have You Heard?&quot;. She was the first American to record at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, and recorded five albums there. She was also very popular across parts of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the Philippines where she performed at Manila&#x27;s now defunct EM Club in 1957. She also scored a big hit in Manila with Filipino composer Salvador Asuncion&#x27;s work titled &quot;In Despair&quot;.

Joni James had seven Top 10 hits on the various &quot;Billboard&quot; charts that existed before the Hot 100: &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Believe Me?&quot; (No. 1 in 1952) &quot;Have You Heard?&quot; (No. 4 in 1953) &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; (No. 2 in 1953) &quot;Almost Always&quot; (No. 9 in 1953) &quot;My Love, My Love&quot; (No. 8 in 1953) &quot;How Important Can It Be?&quot; (No. 2 in 1955) and &quot;You Are My Love&quot; (No. 6 in 1955) as well as sixteen other Top 40 hits from 1952 to 1960. She has sold more than 100 million records and recorded more than 25 albums.

==Personal life==
James married composer-conductor Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Acquaviva at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York in 1956. In 1964, she retired from the music industry in part because Acquaviva was in bad health and needed her attention. She cared for him until his death in 1986.

Shortly after her first husband&#x27;s death, James met retired Air Force General Bernard Schriever. He had led the crash program that developed U.S. ballistic missiles — both ICBMs and IRBMs in 1953–62. The couple wed on October 5, 1997, in Arlington, Virginia. They honeymooned in France and the Greek Isles, then took up residence in Schriever&#x27;s home in Washington, D.C. Bernard Schriever died on June 20, 2005, aged 94.

James is mentioned by Snoopy in the last panel of the May 1, 1976 comic strip of Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Schulz was a fan and friend of James who had Snoopy featured on the cover of her &quot;Jukebox Joni&quot; 1999 compilation album.

==Later years==
For many years she was out of the public eye, but began touring again in the mid-1990s some years after she was widowed, performing memorable concerts at New York&#x27;s Town Hall, Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall.

In October 2001, just a few weeks after 9/11, she appeared at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, accompanied by the Count Basie orchestra. The streets of the city were still lined with armed soldiers, and she was a guest of honor at the American Film Institute&#x27;s Life Achievement Tribute to Barbra Streisand. With her renewed popularity, nearly her entire body of work was released on the Capitol-EMI, DRG and Taragon labels under her personal supervision and, in 2000, she released a new recording, &quot;Latest and Greatest&quot;.

James died at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida, on February 20, 2022, at the age of 91. She was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

For her contributions to the entertainment industry, James has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>The Astor family achieved prominence in business, society, and politics in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries. With German roots, some of their ancestry goes back to the Italian and Swiss Alps,
the Astors settled in Germany, first appearing in North America in the 18th century with John Jacob Astor, one of the wealthiest people in history.

==Founding family members==

John Jacob Astor (born Johann Jakob Astor) was the youngest of four sons born to Johann Jacob Astor (1724–1816) and Maria Magdalena vom Berg (1730–1764).

The Astor family can trace their ancestry back to Giovan Asdour (1595–1668) and Gretta Ursula Asdour (1589–?). Giovan was born in Chiavenna, Italy, and died in Zürich, Switzerland. Their son, Hans Pieter Asdor, was born in Switzerland and died in Nußloch.

John Jacob and his brother George, born in Walldorf left Germany and moved to London in 1778. There, they established a flute making company. In 1783, John Jacob left for Baltimore, Maryland, leaving his brother in charge of the London business, and was active first as a dealer in woodwind instruments, then in New York as a merchant in opium, furs, pianos, and real estate. After moving to New York, John met and married Sarah Cox Todd (1762–1842). She worked alongside her husband as a consultant, and was accused of witchcraft after her success with the company in 1817. The accusations never led to legal action. They had eight children, including John Jacob Astor Jr. (1791–1869) and real estate businessman William Backhouse Astor Sr. (1792–1875).
John Jacob&#x27;s fur trading company established a Columbia River trading post at Fort Astoria in 1811, the first United States community on the Pacific coast. He financed the overland Astor Expedition in 1810–1812 to reach the outpost, which was in the then-disputed Oregon Country. Control of Fort Astoria played a key role in English and American territorial claims on the region.

John and George&#x27;s brother Henry (born Heinrich) (1754–1833) also emigrated to America. Henry was a horse racing enthusiast, and purchased a thoroughbred named Messenger, who had been brought from England to America in 1788. The horse became the founding sire of all Standardbred horses in the United States today.

The third brother Melchior remained in Germany.

During the 19th century, the Astors became one of the wealthiest families in the United States. Toward the end of that century, some of the family moved from America to England and achieved high prominence there. During the 20th century, the number of American Astors began to decline, but their legacy lives on in their many public works including the New York Public Library. English descendants of the Astors hold two hereditary peerages: Viscount Astor and Baron Astor of Hever.

While many Astor family members joined the Episcopal Church, John Jacob Astor remained a member of a Reformed congregation to his death.

==Family namesake places==
For many years, the members of the Astor family were known as &quot;the landlords of New York&quot;. Their New York City namesakes are the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and Astor Row, Astor Court, Astor Place, and Astor Avenue in the Bronx, where the Astors stabled horses. The neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, was renamed to incite John Jacob Astor to invest there.

Beyond New York City, the Astor family name is imprinted in a great deal of United States history and geography. Astor Street, in Chicago&#x27;s landmark Gold Coast district, is named after John Jacob Astor. There are towns of Astor in the states of Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas and there are Astorias in Illinois, Missouri, and Oregon. In Astoria, Oregon, the primary elementary school, a filming location for the 1990 film Kindergarten Cop, is called John Jacob Astor Elementary. The city is also home to the Astoria Column.

In Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom, there was a secondary state school named Astor of Hever School. It was located within Oakwood Park, a former residence of the Astor family, which the family gifted to the Borough of Maidstone to be used for educational purposes. Whilst the Astor of Hever School changed its name in the early 2010s, it is still located on the Oakwood Park Estate, along with a Grammar School, a Catholic Secondary school and the Maidstone campus of Mid-Kent College. At one time the Oakwood Park Estate also contained an educational farm attached to the Astor of Hever School. 

There is a neighborhood called Astor Park just south of downtown Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the heart of this neighborhood is a park (also called &quot;Astor Park&quot;); the Astor family donated this land for the building of a trade school.

The Astors were also prominent on Mackinac Island, Michigan, and Newport, Rhode Island, with their summer house, Beechwood. At Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, there are the Lord and Lady Astor Suites; the hotel salon is called Astor&#x27;s. There is even a Hostel in York, England called The Astor. In addition, a dormitory at St. George&#x27;s School in Newport, Rhode Island, bears Astor&#x27;s name.

The Danubius Hotel Astoria in the center of Pest, Budapest, Hungary, opened in 1914, was given its name by the original hotel owners and Mihály Gellér, the first General Manager of the hotel, who formerly worked for the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. In Shanghai, China there is the Astor House Hotel in the Bund.

Mount Astor in Antarctica was named after Vincent Astor by the explorer Richard E. Byrd.

<doc id="537478" wikidata="Q898788" url="?curid=537478" title="Air supremacy">
<text>Aerial supremacy (also known as air superiority) is the degree to which a side in a conflict holds control of air power over opposing forces. There are levels of control of the air in aerial warfare. Control of the air is the aerial equivalent of command of the sea.

Air power has increasingly become a powerful element of military campaigns; military planners view having an environment of at least air superiority as a necessity. Air supremacy allows increased bombing efforts, tactical air support for ground forces, paratroop assaults, airdrops and simple cargo plane transfers, which can move ground forces and supplies. Air power is a function of the degree of air superiority and numbers or types of aircraft, but it represents a situation that defies black-and-white characterization. The degree of a force&#x27;s air control is a zero-sum game with its opponent&#x27;s; increasing control by one corresponds to decreasing control by the other. Air forces unable to contest for air superiority or air parity can strive for &quot;air denial&quot;, where they maintain an operations level conceding air superiority to the other side, but preventing it from achieving air supremacy.

The achievement of aerial supremacy does not guarantee a low loss rate of friendly aircraft, as hostile forces are often able to adopt unconventional tactics or identify weaknesses. For example, NATO forces which held aerial superiority over Kosovo still lost a stealth strike aircraft to a Serbian ground-based air defense system, despite it being considered &quot;obsolete&quot;. Several engagements have occurred in asymmetrical conflicts in which relatively poorly-equipped ground forces have been able to achieve aircraft kills despite working against overwhelming aerial supremacy. During both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan, insurgents found a greater degree of success in attacking coalition aircraft on the ground than when they were operating above them in the skies.

== Levels ==
* &quot;Air supremacy&quot; is the highest level, where a side holds complete control of the skies. It is defined by NATO and the United States Department of Defense as the &quot;degree of air superiority wherein the opposing air force is incapable of effective interference&quot;.
* &quot;Air superiority&quot; is the second level, where a side is in a more favorable position than the opponent. It is defined in the NATO glossary as the &quot;degree of dominance in [an] air battle ... that permits the conduct of operations by [one side] and its related land, sea and air forces at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by opposing air forces.&quot;
* &quot;Favorable air situation&quot; is defined as &quot;an air situation in which the extent of air effort applied by the enemy air forces is insufficient to prejudice the success of friendly land, sea or air operations.&quot;
* &quot;Air parity&quot; is the lowest level of control, where no side holds any level of control of skies.

==Methods==

Although the destruction of enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat is the most obvious aspect of air superiority, it is not the only method of obtaining air superiority. Historically, the most effective method of gaining air superiority is the destruction of enemy aircraft on the ground and the destruction of the means and infrastructure by which an opponent may mount air operations (such as destroying fuel supplies, cratering runways with anti-runway penetration bombs and the sowing of air-fields with area denial weapons). A historical example of this is &quot;Operation Focus&quot; in which the outnumbered Israeli Air Force dealt a crippling blow to the Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian Air Forces and airfields at the start of the Six-Day War, achieving Israeli air supremacy.

Disruption can be carried out through ground and air attack. The main role for which the British Special Air Service was formed was to conduct raids on German aircraft and airfields. During operations in the Western Desert the SAS are reckoned to have destroyed more than 400 enemy aircraft. On 6 December 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Raiding Group Teishin Shudan destroyed B-29 aircraft on Leyte. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union claimed it could achieve air superiority despite the inferiority of its fighters, by over-running NATO airfields and parking their tanks on the runways, similar to what they have done during Tatsinskaya Raid during the Battle of Stalingrad (note the Germans used parts of their autobahn motorways as airfields during the last war). The Soviet Union planned to use its Spetsnaz special forces in attacks on NATO airfields in the event of conflict.

Attacks by special forces have been seen by some commanders as a way to level the playing field when faced by superior numbers or technology. Given the disparity in effectiveness between their own and South Korean and US fighters, North Korea maintains a large force of infiltration troops; in the event of a war, they would be tasked, among other missions, with attacking coalition airfields with mortar, machine gun and sniper fire, possibly after insertion by some 300 An-2 low radar-observable biplanes. This strategy has been practiced in active conflicts even in recent decades; during the asymmetrical warfare of the War in Afghanistan, 15 fedayeen destroyed or severely damaged eight United States Marine Corps Harrier jump jets in the September 2012 Camp Bastion raid, one result of which being pilots fighting as infantry for the first time in 70 years. Similarly, during the Iraqi War, four Apaches were destroyed on the ground in 2007 by insurgents armed with mortar, which were unintentionally aided by web-published geotagged photographs taken by coalition soldiers.

==History==

===First World War===
The First World War saw many firsts in the field of aerial warfare, including the deployment of aircraft armed with machine guns, the first successful engagement involving synchronisation-gun-armed aircraft on the afternoon of 1 July 1915. Throughout the conflict, air superiority on the Western Front changed hands between the German Empire and the Allies several times. It became recognised that the worst losses was amongst new pilots, many of whom lasted just a day or two. The emergence of specialised fighter units, which were typically led by highly experienced pilots, some of them survivors of the Fokker Scourge period, greatly increased the effectiveness of fighter units.

Early on, the Allies gained a lead over the Germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus fighter and the Morane-Saulnier L. In response, Germany bolstered its own aerial development efforts; a major achievement of the era was the (push rod controller), a genuine synchronisation gear, developed by the Fokker company. The device was fitted to the most suitable Fokker type, the Fokker M.5K (military designation Fokker A.III), of which A.16/15, assigned to Otto Parschau, became the prototype of the Fokker Eindecker series of fighter designs. This subsequently contributed to a period of German air superiority known as the Fokker Scourge, lasting between late 1915 and early 1916. A briefer period of German aerial dominance occurred in the Bloody April of April 1917; paradoxically, the Germans were disadvantaged on paper during Bloody April in terms of numerical inferiority; their effectiveness was increased by confining themselves to mainly operating over friendly territory, both reducing the possibility of pilots being captured and increasing the amount of time they could stay in the air. Moreover, German pilots could choose when and how they would engage, effectively dictating the terms of combat.

The Italian &quot;Corpo Aeronautico Militare&quot; established air superiority over the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in late October 1918. The Allies operated roughly 600 aircraft (93 Anglo-French, including four RAF squadrons) to gain complete air superiority in this final offensive. The defeat suffered by Austria-Hungary at Vittorio Veneto has been attributed with causing the dissolution of the empire. In turn, the surrender of Germany&#x27;s primary ally was another major factor in the German Empire&#x27;s decision that the conflict was no longer viable and needed to end.

===Interwar period===
In 1921, Italian aerial warfare theorist Giulio Douhet published &quot;The Command of the Air&quot;, a book positing that future wars would be decided in the skies. At the time, mainstream military theory did not see air power as a war-winning tactic. Douhet&#x27;s idea was that air power could be a decisive force and be used to avoid the long and costly War of Attrition. In &quot;The War of 19,&quot; Douhet theorized that a future war between Germany and France would be settled in a matter of days, as the winner would be the one to gain air supremacy and destroy a few enemy cities with aerial bombs. He speculated that, while the targets would be announced ahead of time and all the population evacuated, but that the event would terrorize citizens into pressuring their government into immediate surrender. At the beginning of the Second World War, Douhet&#x27;s ideas were dismissed by some, but it became apparent that his theories on the importance of aircraft were supported by events as the war continued.

In 1925, the Royal Air Force (RAF) tested the ability of air supremacy in isolation from other warfare forms during their first independent action in Waziristan. The operation, that later came to be known as Pink&#x27;s War after Wing Commander Richard Pink in charge, used only air warfare in a combination of air attack and &quot;air blockade&quot; over 54 days to force militant tribes to surrender. The campaign was successful in defeating the tribes with two deaths for the RAF, but contemporary critics were not entirely convinced of its use in isolation; Commander-in-Chief, India General Sir Claud Jacob stated that &quot;satisfactory ... the results of these operations have been, I am of [the] opinion that a combination of land and air action would have brought about the desired result in a shorter space of time, and next time action has to be taken, I trust that it will be possible to employ the two forces in combination&quot;.
American general Billy Mitchell was another influential air power theorist of the inter-war period. After the First World War I, then-Assistant Chief of Air Service in the United States Army Air Service under Chief Mason Patrick, Mitchell arranged live fire exercises that proved that aircraft could sink battleships (the largest and most heavily armed class of warships). The first of these was &quot;Project B&quot; in 1921, in which the captured First World War-era German battleship, &quot;SMS Ostfriesland&quot;, was sunk by a flight of bombers in 22 minutes.

Mitchell&#x27;s ideas were not popular, with his outspoken opposition to Army and Navy resistance resulting in a court-martial that precipitated his resignation, but he would prove prescient; his 1924 inspection tour of Hawaii and Asia culminated in a report (published in 1925 as the book &quot;Winged Defense&quot;) that predicted future war with Japan, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. He would also go on to influence air power advocates such as Russian-American Alexander P. de Seversky, whose 1942 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book, &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot;, was made into a 1943 Walt Disney animated film that opened with a quote from Mitchell; the film is reported to have been influentially shown by Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt in support of long-range bombing.

Seeking to influence the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, various international powers tried to influence the conflict via a heavy reliance on air power. The French government provided aircraft to the Republicans covertly, such as the Potez 540 bomber aircraft (nicknamed the &quot;Flying Coffin&quot; by Spanish Republican pilots), Dewoitine aircraft, and Loire 46 fighter aircraft being sent to the Republican forces, along with a group of trained fighter pilots and engineers to aid the Republicans. Also, until 8 September 1936, aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they were bought in other countries. The Soviet Union also covertly aided Republicans, between 634 and 806 aircraft were supplied alongside various other armaments. Both Italy and Nazi Germany supplied large numbers of aircraft to the Nationalists while also deploying their own units, such as the Condor Legion and the Aviazione Legionaria, to bolster the Nationalist&#x27;s forces with their own. While the Soviet aircraft were in current service with their own forces, they proved inferior to those supplied by Germany by the end of the conflict. The use of aircraft, particularly by the Nationalists to continually pressure Republican forces and compel multiple withdrawals during the Aragon Offensive, allegedly informed both the Germans and Soviets of the value of using aircraft to support infantry.

===Second World War===

At the beginning of the Second World War, the opposing sides developed different views on the importance of air power. Nazi Germany viewed it as a helpful tool to support the German Army, the approach being dubbed &quot;flying artillery&quot;. The Allies saw it, specifically long-range strategic bombing, as being a more important part of warfare which they believed capable of crippling Germany&#x27;s industrial centers.

After the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe (Germany&#x27;s air force) achieved &quot;air supremacy&quot; over Western Europe. The Battle of Britain represented a concerted attempt by Germany to establish &quot;air superiority&quot; over Great Britain, which it never achieved. Through home-territory advantage and Germany&#x27;s failure to push home its strategy of targeting Britain&#x27;s air defenses, Britain was able to establish air superiority over the territory – a superiority that it never lost. It denied the German military air superiority over the English Channel, making a seaborne invasion (planned as Operation Sea Lion) impossible in the face of Britain&#x27;s naval power. Strategically, the overall situation at home and abroad at the end of the battle might be considered &quot;air parity&quot; between Britain and Germany. After the air battle, known as the Battle of Britain, the Germans switched to a strategy of night bombing raids, which Britain echoed with raids over Germany.

During Operation Barbarossa, the Luftwaffe initially achieved air supremacy over the Soviet Union. As the war dragged on, the United States joined the fight and the combined Allied air forces gained air superiority and eventually &quot;supremacy&quot; in the West. (For example, the Luftwaffe mustered 391 aircraft to oppose over 9,000 allied aircraft on D-day.) Russia did the same on the Eastern Front, meaning the Luftwaffe could not effectively interfere with Allied land operations. Achieving allowed the Allies to carry out ever-greater strategic bombing raids on Germany&#x27;s industrial and civilian centers (including the Ruhr and Dresden), and to prosecute the land war successfully on both the Eastern and Western fronts. Following the Big Week attacks in late February 1944, the new 8th Air Force commander Jimmy Doolittle permitted P-51 Mustangs to fly far ahead of the bomber formations instead of closely escorting them starting in March 1944. This commenced in March 1944 and was part of a massive &quot;fighter sweep&quot; tactic to clear German skies of Luftwaffe fighters. Allied planes went after the German fighters wherever they could be found and substantially lowered bomber losses for their side for the rest of the war over Western Europe.
The element of air superiority has been the driving force behind the development of aircraft carriers, which allow aircraft to operate in the absence of designated air bases. For example, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was carried out by aircraft operating from carriers thousands of miles away from the nearest Japanese air base.

Some fighter aircraft specialized in combating other fighters, while interceptors were originally designed to counter bombers. Germany&#x27;s most important air superiority fighters were the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190, while the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane were the primary ones on the British side. Performance and range made the P-51 Mustang the outstanding escort fighter which permitted American bombers to operate over Germany during daylight hours. They shot down 5,954 aircraft, more than any other American fighter in Europe. In the Pacific Theater, the A6M Zero gave Japan air superiority for much of the early part of the war, but suffered against newer naval fighters such as the F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair which exceeded the Zero in performance and durability. The Hellcat shot down 5,168 enemy aircraft (the second highest number), while the land-based Lockheed P-38 was third, shooting down 3,785 in all theaters.

===Cold War===
====Superpower rivalry====
During the Cold War, between 1946 and 1991, the US, UK, and NATO allies faced the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact, and its allies. Both sides engaged in an arms race of improving radar and fighter intercept capability versus the threat of intercontinental strategic bombers carrying nuclear weapons. Initially, high altitude, later combined with high supersonic speeds, was hoped to keep nuclear bombers out of range of fighters and later surface to air missiles, both of which were sometimes equipped with nuclear warheads. In the 1960 U-2 incident an American very high altitude spy plane was shot down over the USSR with a S-75 Dvina(SA-2) long range high altitude surface to air missile largely refuting the concept of high altitude as a refuge for high-performance bomber aircraft. US training changed to low altitude flight of bombers and unpiloted cruise missiles in the hopes of avoiding ground-based air defense radar networks by hiding in with ground clutter and terrain, thwarting attempts at air supremacy over the enemy landmass. Ballistic missiles were also introduced and were very difficult and expensive to intercept even with nuclear-armed defensive missiles.

Airborne early warning and control flying radar aircraft as well as look down shoot down radar in fighter and interceptor aircraft allowed engaging low flying invaders again tipping the balance though this was partly ameliorated by succeeding generations of electronic countermeasures. Ultimately the US led the way in first applying stealth technology to small strike aircraft like the F-117 and stealthy nuclear cruise missiles carried in conventional bombers for standoff release before the air defenses got too thick. The Soviet Union invested heavily in expensive to defeat intermediate and intercontinental range nuclear missiles and less on expensive to maintain patrol bombers, though they had to spend heavily on interceptors and surface to air missiles as well as radar sites to cover the huge landmass of the Soviet Union. The US joined with Canada to organize defense of the area of Alaska, Canada, and the continental United States with North American Aerospace Defense Command or NORAD using both interceptors, some armed with the nuclear AIR-2 Genie, and a surface to air missile component, which was at one point partly nuclearized. Development for the B-2 stealth bomber was intended for, and in anticipation of, a nuclear war and it was the first fully mature stealth aircraft to enter service. The F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter was a stealth fighter and interceptor aircraft designed during the Cold War as a medium altitude air superiority fighter which was intended to destroy Warsaw Pact aircraft without ever being detected or engaged; both were introduced after the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Air superiority in the feared Cold War era WW-III European theater would include fighters intercepting or diverting nuclear and conventionally armed strike aircraft and ground-based air defences, some of which were developed into mobile systems which could accompany and protect armored and mechanized formations. While the Cold War never went hot directly between NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances, the US was engaged in two major limited air wars aiding allies who faced Soviet-supported enemies, with both sides using weaponry designed to fight such a conflict; the Korean and Vietnam wars.

====Korean War====
The Korean War represented a major turning point for aerial warfare, being the first conflict in which jet aircraft played the central role in combat. Once-formidable fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, and Hawker Sea Fury—all piston-engined, propeller-driven, and designed during the Second World War—relinquished their air superiority roles to a new generation of faster, jet-powered fighters arriving in the theater. In the initial months of fighting, the P-80 Shooting Star, F9F Panther, Gloster Meteor and other jets under the UN flag dominated the Korean People&#x27;s Air Force (KPAF) propeller-driven Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-9s. By early August 1950, the KPAF was reduced to only about 20 planes.

However, with the Chinese intervention in late October 1950, the KPAF begun receiving the MiG-15, which was one of the world&#x27;s most advanced jet fighters at that time. Equipped with not only jet propulsion but also a swept wing, the MiG-15 quickly outclassed the straight-wing United Nations fighters. In response, the United States dispatched three squadrons of its own swept-wing fighter, the F-86 Sabre, which arrived in the theatre in December 1950. The Sabre reportedly claimed kill ratios as high as 10 to 1 against the MiGs, allegedly shooting down 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft in exchange for 78 Sabres that were lost to enemy fire. Meanwhile, the Grumman F9F Panther, a straight-wing carrier-based jet, became the mainstay of the USN during the period and had a relatively good showing, possessing a 7:2 kill ratio against the more powerful MiG-15.

====Vietnam War====
During the Vietnam war the US side, especially over the north, had restrictive rules of engagement often requiring visual identification nullifying the advantage they would have had using beyond visual range missiles though possibly avoiding friendly fire due to IFF systems not being ubiquitous on US strike aircraft. In the 1950s, the United States Navy tasked the F-8 Crusader, known affectionately as the &quot;Last Gun Fighter&quot; as their close-in air superiority fighter. This role would be taken over by the F-4 Phantom, which was designed as a missile armed interceptor. The USAF had developed the F-100 and F-104 as air superiority fighters, though by the Vietnam war had already phased out the F-100 from all but air support missions and the fast but slow turning F-104 allegedly deterred attacks and despite losses scored no victories in air combat but in the USAF was also replaced by the F-4 by 1967. Especially under the rules of engagement imposed on them the &#x27;Century Series&quot; aircraft initially specifically designed for intercepting heavy nuclear bombers or delivering tactical nuclear weapons were found to be wanting when they were engaged by the very agile fighters Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 and Shenyang J-6 provided to the VPAF by the USSR and PRC; the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 while less agile was formidable against the F-4 and traded range for very high performance. This imbalance lead to the USAF ordering variants of the F-4 with an internal 20mm gun, and both the USAF and USN sometimes flying with centerline gun pods on aircraft not equipped with an internal gun.

In the 1960s, the limited agility of American fighters in dogfights over Vietnam led to a revival of dedicated air superiority fighters, which led the development of the &quot;Teen Series&quot; F-14, F-15, F-16 and F/A-18. All of them made close-combat manoeuvrability a top priority, and were equipped with guns absent from early Phantoms. The heavy F-14 and F-15 were assigned the primary air superiority mission, because of their longer range radars and capability to carry more missiles of longer range than lightweight fighters.

====Arab–Israeli wars====
From 1948, when Israel reestablished independence from a protective League of Nations mandatory regime managed by the UK, the neighbouring countries have, to varying degrees, disputed the legitimacy of a Jewish state in a majority Arab region. Some neighbouring states have in the last few decades recognized and signed peace treaties; all have ceased large scale conventional warfare to overrun Israel in large part due to an increasing ability to impose Israeli air supremacy over the region&#x27;s airspace when required.

=====1948 war=====

The Israeli Air Force formed in 1948 with the formation of the modern State of Israel. Israel was involved in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War immediately after the end of the British mandate in Palestine. The air force initially consisted of mainly donated civil aircraft, a variety of obsolete and surplus ex-World War II combat-aircraft were quickly sourced by various means to supplement this fleet. Creativity and resourcefulness were the early foundations of Israeli military success in the air, rather than technology which, at the inception of the IAF, was generally inferior to that used by Israel&#x27;s adversaries. In light of the complete Arab theater air supremacy, and the bombing and shelling of existing airbases, the first Israeli military-grade fighters operated from a hastily constructed makeshift airbase around the current Herzliya Airport, with fighters dispersed between the trees of an orange orchard. As the war progressed, more and more Czechoslovak, American, and British surplus WWII-era aircraft were procured, leading to a shift in the balance of power.

=====1956 war=====

In 1956, Israel, France, and the United Kingdom occupied the Sinai Peninsula after Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships, sparking the Suez Crisis. Israel&#x27;s new French-made Dassault Mystere IV jet fighters provided air cover for the paratroop transport aircraft. The Egyptian tactic was to use their new Soviet-made MiG-15 jets as fighter escorts, while their older jets conducted strikes against Israeli troops and vehicles. In air combat, Israeli aircraft shot down between seven and nine Egyptian jets with the loss of one plane, but Egyptian strikes against the ground forces continued through to 1 November. After several sorties were launched by French and British aircraft, President Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered his pilots to withdraw to bases in Southern Egypt. The Israeli Air Force was then free to strike Egyptian ground forces at will.

=====1967 war=====
In 1967, the Straits of Tiran were again closed and international peacekeepers were ejected by Egypt. Israel then initiated Operation Focus. Israel sent nearly every capable combat aircraft out against the vastly larger Egyptian Air Force, holding only four for protection. Egyptian airfields were destroyed with anti-runway penetration bombs and the aircraft were mostly destroyed on the ground; Syria and Jordan also had their air forces destroyed when they entered the conflict. This is one of the preeminent examples of a smaller force seizing air supremacy where Israel had complete control of the skies above the entire conflict area.

=====War of Attrition=====

Following the Six-Day War, from 1967 to 1970, there were small scale incursions into the Israeli-held Sinai desert as Egypt rearmed. This evolved into large-scale artillery and air incursions in 1969, with Soviet pilots and SAM crews arriving to assist in January 1970. The strategy was to engage Israeli aircraft in surprise fighter encounters near the Suez Canal where Egyptian SAMs could be used to assist fighters. Syrian, North Korean, and Cuban pilots assisting also suffered losses in this period. In August 1970, a cease-fire was agreed on.

=====1973 war=====
The first few days of the 1973 Yom Kippur War saw major Arab ground breakthroughs, surprising Israel who, after its lopsided 1967 victory, considered its air supremacy sufficient to blunt or dissuade any conventional attack. Despite Egypt and Syria having rebuilt their air forces since 1967, Israel continued to deny them the airspace over the battle area; however, these Arab forces were able to control losses and shoot down Israeli air support aircraft by employing mobile surface to air weaponry which travelled along with invading units. Most of Israel&#x27;s air power in the first few days was directed to reinforce the badly mismatched garrison overlooking the besieged Golan Heights which was under attack by Syria. After weakening the Arab SAM cover with airstrikes, commando raids, and armored cavalry, the Arab armored units outran their mobile SAM cover and Israeli aircraft began to take greater control of Egyptian skies, permitting Israeli landings and establishing a beachhead on the west bank of the Suez canal. When Egyptian fighter aircraft were sent into the area of the Israeli bridgehead, SAM sites were offlined which allowed Israeli air power to more safely engage and destroy many Egyptian fighters though taking some losses.

=====1978 Lebanon conflict=====
The 1978 South Lebanon conflict was an invasion of Lebanon up to the Litani River, carried out by the Israel Defense Forces in 1978 in response to the Coastal Road massacre. Israel had complete air supremacy.

=====1982 Lebanon invasion=====
In the 1982 Lebanon War where Israel invaded up to Beirut, Syria intervened on the side of Lebanon and the PLO forces residing there. Israeli jets shot down between 82 and 86 Syrian aircraft in aerial combat, without losses. A single Israeli A-4 Skyhawk and two helicopters were shot down by anti-aircraft fire and SAM missiles. This was the largest aerial combat battle of the jet age with over 150 fighters from both sides engaged. Syrian claims of aerial victories were met with skepticism even from their Soviet allies.
The Soviets were so shaken by the staggering losses sustained by their allies that they dispatched the deputy head of their air defense force to Syria to examine how the Israelis had been so dominant.

The Israelis have upheld substantial air superiority for most of this time with Israel able to operate almost unopposed; Israel held near air supremacy against targets anywhere within range in the Middle East and North Africa until today. Regarding aircraft procurement, Israel started with British and French designs, then transitioning to indigenous production and then also design before moving again to purchasing to American designs. The Arabs directly participating in these battles against Israel except for Jordan and, to some extent, Iraq have commonly used Soviet designs.

====Falklands War====

In the Falklands War (2 April–20 June 1982), the British deployed Harrier jets as air superiority fighters against Argentina&#x27;s Mach-capable Dassault Mirage IIIEA fighters and subsonic Douglas A-4 Skyhawk jets. Despite the Sea Harrier&#x27;s numerical and performance disadvantages, the British Harrier force suffered no air-to-air losses for over twenty Argentine aircraft shot down in aerial combat. Argentine airpower targeted Royal Navy ships during the landings at San Carlos Bay, numerous British vessels were lost or moderately damaged. However, many British ships escaped being sunk due to the Argentine pilots releasing their bombs at very low altitude, and hence those bomb fuzes did not have sufficient time to arm before impact and thus many never exploded. The pilots would have been aware of this—but released at such low altitudes due to the high concentration of British SAMs, Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA), and Sea Harriers, many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised retarding devices, allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.

====Gulf War====

The Iraqi Air Force suffered almost complete obliteration in the opening stages of the Persian Gulf War (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991). It lost most of its aircraft, as well as command-and-control capability, to precise Coalition strikes or when Iraqi personnel flew their aircraft to Iran. Iraqi Anti-aircraft defenses, including shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, were surprisingly ineffective against coalition aircraft, suffering only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, of which 42 of these were the result of Iraqi action while the other 33 were reportedly lost to accidents. In particular, RAF and US Navy aircraft which flew at low altitudes to avoid radar were particularly vulnerable, though this changed when the aircrews were ordered to fly above the AAA.

===Post Cold War===

During the 1980s, the United States commenced work on a new fighter capable of gaining air superiority without being detected by an opposing force, approving the Advanced Tactical Fighter program to develop a replacement for the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) aging F-15 fleet. The YF-23 and the YF-22 were chosen as the finalists in the competition. During 2005, the F-22 Raptor, the subsequent result of the program, became operational. USAF officials have promoted the F-22 as being a critical component of the service&#x27;s tactical air power. Its combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and avionics systems is said to enable unprecedented air combat capabilities.

Anthony Cordesman wrote of NATO&#x27;s theater air supremacy during its 1999 intervention in the Kosovo War of 1998–1999. According to several reports, including reports by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that quote Russian sources, the Russian Federation has in recent decades formulated explicit strategies for using tactical nuclear weapons. These new strategies have in part resulted from the assumption of obtaining air supremacy and use by the U.S. Air Force of precision munitions with little collateral damage in the Kosovo conflict in what amounted to quick mass destruction of military assets once only possible with nuclear weapons or massive bombing against fellow Slavic Serbians; it also assumed that Russia and its allies do not have the strategic economic capacity of current NATO and allied nations to meet this threat with conventional weapons. In response Vladimir Putin, then secretary of the Security Council of Russia, developed a concept of using both tactical and strategic nuclear threats and strikes to de-escalate or cause an enemy to disengage from a conventional conflict threatening what Russia considered a strategic interest. This concept was formalized when Putin took power in Russia in the following year.

Throughout the Syrian Civil War of the 2010s, Israel was reportedly able to hold a general stance of air superiority over the Syrian forces, enabling offensive operations with relative impunity. However, this was challenged during 2018 by the deployment of a Russian-supplied S-400 missile battery to the Syrian theatre. During the February 2018 Israel–Syria incident, despite the loss of an aircraft, Israel has demonstrated their capability to operate without effective interference within the Syrian theater. On 22 May 2018, Israeli Air Force chief Amikam Norkin said that the service had employed their F-35Is in two attacks on two battle fronts, marking the first combat operation of an F-35 by any country.

<text>The Kane quantum computer is a proposal for a scalable quantum computer proposed by Bruce Kane in 1998, who was then at the University of New South Wales. Often thought of as a hybrid between quantum dot and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Kane computer is based on an array of individual phosphorus donor atoms embedded in a pure silicon lattice. Both the nuclear spins of the donors and the spins of the donor electrons participate in the computation.

Unlike many quantum computation schemes, the Kane quantum computer is in principle scalable to an arbitrary number of qubits. This is possible because qubits may be individually addressed by electrical means.

==Description==

The original proposal calls for phosphorus donors to be placed in an array with a spacing of 20 nm, approximately 20 nm below the surface. An insulating oxide layer is grown on top of the silicon. Metal A gates are deposited on the oxide above each donor, and J gates between adjacent donors.

The phosphorus donors are isotopically pure 31P, which have a nuclear spin of 1/2. The silicon substrate is isotopically pure 28Si which has nuclear spin 0. Using the nuclear spin of the P donors as a method to encode qubits has two major advantages. Firstly, the state has an extremely long decoherence time, perhaps on the order of 1018 seconds at millikelvin temperatures. Secondly, the qubits may be manipulated by applying an oscillating magnetic field, as in typical NMR proposals. By altering the voltage on the A gates, it should be possible to alter the Larmor frequency of individual donors. This allows them to be addressed individually, by bringing specific donors into resonance with the applied oscillating magnetic field.

Nuclear spins alone will not interact significantly with other nuclear spins 20 nm away. Nuclear spin is useful to perform single-qubit operations, but to make a quantum computer, two-qubit operations are also required. This is the role of electron spin in this design. Under A-gate control, the spin is transferred from the nucleus to the donor electron. Then, a potential is applied to the J gate, drawing adjacent donor electrons into a common region, greatly enhancing the interaction between the neighbouring spins. By controlling the J gate voltage, two-qubit operations are possible.

Kane&#x27;s proposal for readout was to apply an electric field to encourage spin-dependent tunneling of an electron to transform two neutral donors to a D+–D– state, that is, one where two electrons associate with the same donor. The charge excess is then detected using a single-electron transistor. This method has two major difficulties. Firstly, the D– state has strong coupling with the environment and hence a short decoherence time. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it&#x27;s not clear that the D– state has a sufficiently long lifetime to allow for readout—the electron tunnels into the conduction band.

==Development==
Since Kane&#x27;s proposal, under the guidance of Robert Clark and now Michelle Simmons, pursuing realisation of the Kane quantum computer has become the primary quantum computing effort in Australia. Theorists have put forward a number of proposals for improved readout. Experimentally, atomic-precision deposition of phosphorus atoms has been achieved using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) technique in 2003. Detection of the movement of single electrons between small, dense clusters of phosphorus donors has also been achieved. The group remains optimistic that a practical large-scale quantum computer can be built. Other groups believe that the idea needs to be modified.

In 2020, Andrea Morello and others demonstrated that an antimony nucleus (with eight spin states) embedded in silicon could be controlled using an electric field, rather than a magnetic field.

<text>A building code (also building control or building regulations) is a set of rules that specify the standards for construction objects such as buildings and non-building structures. Buildings must conform to the code to obtain planning permission, usually from a local council. The main purpose of building codes is to protect public health, safety and general welfare as they relate to the construction and occupancy of buildings and for example, the building codes in many countries require engineers to consider the effects of soil liquefaction in the design of new buildings. The building code becomes law of a particular jurisdiction when formally enacted by the appropriate governmental or private authority.

Building codes are generally intended to be applied by architects, engineers, interior designers, constructors and regulators but are also used for various purposes by safety inspectors, environmental scientists, real estate developers, subcontractors, manufacturers of building products and materials, insurance companies, facility managers, tenants, and others. Codes regulate the design and construction of structures where adopted into law.

Examples of building codes began in ancient times. In the USA the main codes are the International Building Code or International Residential Code [IBC/IRC], electrical codes and plumbing, mechanical codes. Fifty states and the District of Columbia have adopted the I-Codes at the state or jurisdictional level. In Canada, national model codes are published by the National Research Council of Canada. In the United Kingdom, compliance with Building Regulations is monitored by building control bodies, either Approved Inspectors or Local Authority Building Control departments. Building Control regularisation charges apply in case work is undertaken which should have had been inspected at the time of the work if this was not done.

== Types ==
The practice of developing, approving, and enforcing building codes varies considerably among nations. In some countries building codes are developed by the government agencies or quasi-governmental standards organizations and then enforced across the country by the central government. Such codes are known as the national building codes (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide application).

In other countries, where the power of regulating construction and fire safety is vested in local authorities, a system of model building codes is used. Model building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative orders. When referenced in any of these legal instruments, a particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as &#x27;adoption by reference&#x27;. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any portions of the model code adopted, it is usually required by the model code developer to follow a formal adoption procedure in which those modifications can be documented for legal purposes.

There are instances when some local jurisdictions choose to develop their own building codes. At some point in time all major cities in the United States had their own building codes. However, due to ever increasing complexity and cost of developing building regulations, virtually all municipalities in the country have chosen to adopt model codes instead. For example, in 2008 New York City abandoned its proprietary &quot;1968 New York City Building Code&quot; in favor of a customized version of the International Building Code. The City of Chicago remains the only municipality in America that continues to use a building code the city developed on its own as part of the &quot;Municipal Code of Chicago&quot;.

In Europe, the , is a pan-European building code that has superseded the older national building codes. Each country now has National Annexes to localize the contents of the Eurocodes.

Similarly, in India, each municipality and urban development authority has its own building code, which is mandatory for all construction within their jurisdiction. All these local building codes are variants of a National Building Code, which serves as model code proving guidelines for regulating building construction activity.

=== Scope ===

The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.
Building codes generally include:
* Standards for structure, placement, size, usage, wall assemblies, fenestration size/locations, egress rules, size/location of rooms, foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures/assemblies, energy efficiency, stairs and halls, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site drainage &amp; storage, appliance, lighting, fixtures standards, occupancy rules, and swimming pool regulations
* Rules regarding parking and traffic impact
* Fire code rules to minimize the risk of a fire and to ensure safe evacuation in the event of such an emergency
* Requirements for earthquake (seismic code), hurricane, flood, and tsunami resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large buildings where a failure would be catastrophic
* Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of flammable substances, or housing a large number of people)
* Energy provisions and consumption
* Grandfather clauses: Unless the building is being renovated, the building code usually does not apply to existing buildings.
* Specifications on components
* Allowable installation methodologies
* Minimum and maximum room ceiling heights, exit sizes and location
* Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work
* For high structures, anti-collision markers for the benefit of aircraft

Building codes are generally separate from zoning ordinances, but exterior restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.

Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these standards at the site during construction.

There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that have more specific requirements that apply to dwellings or places of business and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, pedestrian walkways, parking lots, and radio and television antennas.

==Criticism==
Building codes have been criticized for contributing to housing crisis and increasing the cost of new housing to some extent, including through conflicting code between different administrators. Proposed improvements include regular review and cost-benefit analysis of building codes, promotion of low-cost construction materials and building codes suitable to mass production, reducing bureaucracy, and promoting transparency.
== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Building codes have a long history. The earliest known written building code is included in the Code of Hammurabi, which dates from circa 1772 BC.

The book of Deuteronomy in the Hebrew Bible stipulated that parapets must be constructed on all houses to prevent people from falling off.

In the Chinese book of rites it mentions that ancestral temples and houses should be a certain standard length in ancient China they measured land in the chu or well field system so it was important to be precise though most of the actual lengths are lost or obscure.

In ancient Japan a certain official destroyed a courtiers house because the size was above his rank.

===Modern era===
====France====
In Paris, under the reconstruction of much of the city under the Second Empire (1852–70), great blocks of apartments were erected and the height of buildings was limited by law to five or six stories at most.

====United Kingdom====
After the Great Fire of London in 1666, which had been able to spread so rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city, the Rebuilding of London Act 1666 was passed in the same year as the first significant building regulation. Drawn up by Sir Matthew Hale, the act regulated the rebuilding of the city, required housing to have some fire resistance capacity and authorised the City of London Corporation to reopen and widen roads. The Laws of the Indies were passed in the 1680s by the Spanish Crown to regulate the urban planning for colonies throughout Spain&#x27;s worldwide imperial possessions.

The first systematic national building standard was established with the Metropolitan Buildings Act 1844. Among the provisions, builders were required to give the district surveyor two days&#x27; notice before building, regulations regarding the thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of chimneys, fireplaces and drains were to be enforced and streets had to be built to minimum requirements.

The Metropolitan Buildings Office was formed to regulate the construction and use of buildings throughout London. Surveyors were empowered to enforce building regulations, which sought to improve the standard of houses and business premises, and to regulate activities that might threaten public health. In 1855 the assets, powers and responsibilities of the office passed to the Metropolitan Board of Works.

====United States====
The City of Baltimore passed its first building code in 1891. The Great Baltimore Fire occurred in February 1904. Subsequent changes were made that matched other cities. In 1904, a Handbook of the Baltimore City Building Laws was published. It served as the building code for four years. Very soon, a formal building code was drafted and eventually adopted in 1908.

The structural failure of the tank that caused the Great Molasses Flood of 1919 prompted the Boston Building Department to require engineering and architectural calculations be filed and signed. U.S. cities and states soon began requiring sign-off by registered professional engineers for the plans of major buildings.

More recently, the 2015 Berkeley balcony collapse has prompted updates to California&#x27;s balcony building codes, set for 2025, which include stricter material requirements, enhanced load-bearing standards, and mandatory inspections which known as SB326 and SB721.These laws mandate regular inspections every six years for multifamily buildings. Property owners and HOAs are required to address any structural or waterproofing issues identified during inspections to ensure compliance and safety. Failure to comply can result in fines, increased liability, and legal consequences. The updates aim to prevent tragedies like the Berkeley collapse, which was caused by dry rot and structural failure, by ensuring the long-term safety and durability of elevated structures.

===== Energy codes =====
The current energy codes of the United States are adopted at the state and municipal levels and are based on the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). Previously, they were based on the Model Energy Code (MEC). As of March 2017, the following residential codes have been partially or fully adopted by states:

* 2015 IECC or equivalent (California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Washington)
* 2012 IECC or equivalent (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas)
* 2009 IECC or equivalent (Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin)
* 2006 IECC or equivalent (Utah)
* 2006 IECC or no statewide code (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming)

=== Australia ===
Australia uses the National Construction Code.

<text>The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) is a multi-university scientific research center within the University System of Maryland dedicated to environmental science, estuarine studies, and marine science.

Its origins are found in a 1925 research station on Solomons Island. In 1973 it became the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies and in 1997 it assumed its current name.

The center focuses on environmental research and education in Maryland, United States, with special attention to problems of the Chesapeake Bay, and includes climate research. Research programs are undertaken across the US and globally. Its educational opportunities include graduate studies and undergraduate research internships. The center has about 60 faculty and 110 graduate students. Donald Boesch served as the institution&#x27;s president from 1990 until 2017, and has been succeeded by Peter Goodwin.

UMCES programs are conducted at five constituent research locations:

*Appalachian Laboratory (Frostburg, Maryland) in cooperation with Frostburg State University.
*Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (Solomons, Maryland)
*Horn Point Laboratory (Cambridge, Maryland)
*Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (Baltimore, Maryland) in cooperation with the University of Maryland, Baltimore and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
*Maryland Sea Grant College (College Park, Maryland) in cooperation with the University of Maryland, College Park - UMD College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The Center also administers the Integration and Application Network, which provides scientific data, reports and visualization tools for researchers, students and the general public.

<doc id="537485" wikidata="Q7242792" url="?curid=537485" title="Pride Park">
<text>Pride Park is a business park on the southern outskirts of the city centre of Derby, England. It covers 80 hectares of contaminated former industrial land between the River Derwent and railway lines, and was developed between the 1990s and early 2000s. Pride Park Stadium, Derby Arena and The Sanctuary Local Nature Reserve are also located within Pride Park.

==History==
The site was formerly part of the Derby Works railway yards, and was derelict for many years. It was the original site of Derby&#x27;s railway manufacturing industry, but land here had also been used for gas- and coke works, gravel abstraction and landfill. These uses left behind large amounts of industrial contaminants, including tars, phenols, heavy metals, ammonia and boron. Extensive redevelopment took place over 10 years to reclaim the brownfield site, including the building of a new access road to open the area up. Ten hectares of the site was transformed into a Local Nature Reserve called The Sanctuary, in conjunction with Derby City Council.

==Occupants==
* It has been home of Derby County F.C.&#x27;s Pride Park Stadium since 1997, when they relocated from the Baseball Ground in the Normanton district.
* Derby Arena is a multi-purpose sports and events venue adjacent to Pride Park Stadium, which opened in 2015.
* A Park &amp; Ride car park for access to Derby city centre is located next to the stadium.
* Internet bank Egg plc had its headquarters and call centre in the business park until 2011, when it was taken over by Barclaycard, and closed. The building was subsequently occupied by HEROtsc, retaining its function as a call centre.
* The business park also houses a Holiday Inn Express hotel and several car dealerships.
* The sports goods retailer JJB Sports has offices on the Park.
* UTC Derby Pride Park (formerly Derby Manufacturing UTC), a university technical college, opened in September 2015.

==Expansion Plan==
Derby County Football Club are proposed to expand facilities on offer around the football stadium with a £20 million development plan. This is despite the club being unsuccessful in their bid to include the stadium as a venue in England&#x27;s bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

On 3 October 2011, Derby County Football Club announced that it had submitted plans to Derby City Council for a £7 million development of land outside Pride Park Stadium, which the club named &quot;The Plaza @ Pride Park&quot;.

These plans included five cafes/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of office space. The plans were scaled down from the planned £20 million pound development proposed in 2007. Derby County CEO Tom Glick, said that these plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations which will be introduced in the Football League from 2012, as revenue from the Plaza will be reinvested back into the club.

This planned development also coincided with a plan from the City Council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed Plaza.

<text>The Antonov An-72 (NATO reporting name: Coaler) is a Soviet transport aircraft, developed by Antonov. It was designed as a STOL transport and intended as a replacement for the Antonov An-26, but variants have found success as commercial freighters.

The An-72 and the related An-74 get their nickname, &quot;Cheburashka&quot;, from the large engine intake ducts, which resemble the oversized ears of the popular Soviet animated character of the same name.

==Design and development==
The An-72 first flew on and was likely developed as a response to the never-manufactured USAF Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) initiated ten years earlier. Produced in tandem with the An-72, the An-74 variant adds the ability to operate in harsh weather conditions in polar regions, because it can be fitted with wheel-skis landing gear, de-icing equipment, and a number of other upgrades, allowing the aircraft to support operations in Arctic or Antarctic environments. Other An-72 versions include the An-72S VIP transport and An-72P maritime patrol aircraft.

Its first flight was made on , but production started in the late 1980s. The powerplant used is the Lotarev D-36 turbofan engine. The An-72 resembles the unsuccessful Boeing YC-14, a prototype design from the early 1970s (design submitted to the United States Air Force in February 1972,) which had also used overwing engines and the Coandă effect.

The rear fuselage of the aircraft has a hinged loading ramp with a rear fairing that slides backwards and up to clear the opening. Up to can be airdropped while it has folding side seats for 52 passengers.

In 2018, six An-72 aircraft were reported to be upgraded for the Russian Aerospace Forces and Navy to carry more fuel and payload for Arctic operations.

==Operation==
The An-72 has STOL capabilities; its take-off roll is and its landing run is . This aircraft was designed to be used on unprepared surfaces; its robust undercarriage and high-flotation tyres allow operations on sand, grass, or other unpaved surfaces.

==Variants==

* An-71 &quot;Madcap&quot;: Prototype AWACS aircraft developed from the An-72.
* An-72 &quot;Coaler-A&quot;: Preproduction aircraft. Two flying prototypes, one static test airframe and eight preproduction machines.
* An-72A &quot;Coaler-C&quot;: Initial production STOL transport with a longer fuselage and increased wingspan.
* An-72AT – &quot;Coaler-C&quot;: Freight version of the An-72A compatible with standard international shipping containers.
* An-72S – &quot;Coaler-C&quot;: Executive VIP transport fitted with a galley in a front cabin, work and rest areas in a central cabin, and 24 armchairs in a rear cabin, can also be reconfigured for transporting freight or 38 passengers or as an air ambulance carrying eight stretchers.
* An-72P: Patrol aircraft. Armed with one GSh-23L cannon plus bombs and/or rockets.
* An-72R (also known as An-72BR): Prototype electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft, with conformal antenna fairings running up each side of the fuselage. Known as &#x27;Aircraft 88&#x27; during development and erroneously known as An-88.
* An-72-100: Demilitarized An-72.
* An-72-100D: Demilitarized An-72S.

==Accidents and incidents==
, there had been 24 known accidents and incidents involving the An-72 or An-74; of these, seven were reported to involve fatalities:
* CCCP-74002 attempted to take off from Lensk Airport overloaded with fish. All 13 human occupants died when it crashed from the airport.
* An Antonov An-72 chase plane had a mid-air collision while following the Antonov An-70 prototype aircraft during a test flight. The collision caused the An-70 to crash into a forested area, killing all seven An-70 crew members. The An-72 lost a right wing flap, but it was able to return to base safely.
* ER-ACF, an Antonov An-72 disappeared on a cargo flight from Port Bouet Airport, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to Rundu Airport, Namibia. The aircraft and its five crew members disappeared without a trace over the South Atlantic. The cause of the incident remains undetermined.
* UR-74038 carrying food aid to Chad from Libya crashed in Cameroon, killing all 6 crew.
* An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force An-72 crashed after takeoff from Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran, killing 37 of the 38 aboard.
* An An-72 carrying Kazakhstani border patrol officials crashed in Shymkent, killing all 27 people on board.
* An An-72 operated for the DRC Air Force with 4 crew and 4 passengers crashed in Congo; none survived.
* An An-72 operated by the Russian Navy exploded at the Ostafyevo airfield in the Moscow region. The explosion occurred from the detonation of the main power unit. The value of the destroyed aircraft was approximately US$4.5 million.

<doc id="537518" wikidata="Q155239" url="?curid=537518" title="Indian reserve">
<text>In Canada, an Indian reserve () or First Nations reserve () is defined by the &quot;Indian Act&quot; as a &quot;tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in His Majesty, that has been set apart by His Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.&quot; Reserves are areas set aside for First Nations, one of the major groupings of Indigenous peoples in Canada, after a contract with the Canadian state (&quot;the Crown&quot;), and are not to be confused with Indigenous peoples&#x27; claims to ancestral lands under Aboriginal title.

== Demographics ==
Canada has designated 3,394 reserves for over 600 First Nations,as per the federal publication &quot;Registered Indian Population by Sex and Residence, Indian Status is granted to members of a registered band who are eligible to live on these reserves. By 2020, reserves provided shelter for approximately half of these band members.

Many reserves have no resident population; typically they are small, remote, non-contiguous pieces of land, a fact which has led many to be abandoned, or used only seasonally (as a trapping territory, for example). Statistics Canada counts only those reserves which are populated (or potentially populated) as &quot;subdivisions&quot; for the purpose of the national census. For the 2011 census, of the more than 3,100 Indian reserves across Canada, there were only 961 Indian reserves classified as census subdivisions (including the six reserves added for 2011). Some reserves that were originally rural were gradually surrounded by urban development. Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary are examples of cities with urban Indian reserves.

== Governance ==
Band governments typically administer more than one reserve, such as the Beaver Lake Cree Nation with two reserves or Munsee-Delaware Nation, who occupy Munsee-Delaware Nation Indian Reserve No. 1. 

Some reserves are shared by multiple bands, whether as fishing camps or educational facilities such as Pekw&#x27;Xe:yles, a reserve on the Fraser River used by 21 bands. Another multi-band reserve of the peoples is Grass Indian Reserve No. 15, which is located in Chilliwack and is shared by 9 bands.

== History ==

=== Treaties and reserves, 1763–1867 ===
After the Royal Proclamation of 1763 but before Confederation in 1867, the Upper Canada Treaties (1764–1862 Ontario) and the Douglas Treaties (1850–1854 British Columbia) were signed. &quot;Some of these pre-confederation and post-confederation treaties addressed reserve lands, hunting, fishing, trapping rights, annuities and other benefits.&quot; Governor James Douglas of British Columbia, which formally became a colony in 1858, also worked to establish many reserves on the mainland during his tenure, though most of these were overturned by successor colonial governments and later royal commissions once the province joined Confederation in 1871.

=== &quot;Constitution Act 1867&quot; ===
In 1867, legislative jurisdiction over &quot;Indians and Lands reserved for the Indians&quot; was assigned to the Parliament of Canada through the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, a major part of Canada&#x27;s Constitution (originally known as the &quot;British North America Act&quot;), which acknowledged that First Nations had special status. Separate powers covered &quot;status and civil rights on the one hand and Indian lands on the other.&quot;

In 1870, the newly formed Dominion government acquired Rupert&#x27;s Land, a vast territory in British North America consisting mostly of the Hudson Bay drainage basin that had been controlled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company under its Charter with the British Crown from 1670 to 1870. Numerous aboriginal groups lived in the same territory and disputed the sovereignty of the area. The Dominion of Canada promised Britain to honour the provisions of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to &quot;negotiate with its Amerindians for the extinguishment of their title and the setting aside of reserves for their exclusive use.&quot; This promise led to the Numbered Treaties.

=== Numbered treaties, 1871–1921 ===
Between 1871 and 1921, through Numbered Treaties with First Nations, the Canadian government gained large areas of land for settlers and for industry in Northwestern Ontario, Northern Canada and in the Prairies. The treaties were also called the Land Cession or Post-Confederation Treaties. Treaty 1 is an agreement established August 3, 1871, between the Crown and various First Nations in southeastern Manitoba, including the Anishinaabe and the Swampy Cree tribes. Treaty 1 First Nations comprise the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, Fort Alexander (Sagkeeng First Nation), Long Plain First Nation, Peguis First Nation, Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation, Sandy Bay First Nation and Swan Lake First Nation.

=== The &quot;Indian Act 1876&quot; ===
The rights and freedoms of Canada&#x27;s First Nations people have been governed by the &quot;Indian Act&quot; since its enactment in 1876 by the Parliament of Canada. The provisions of Section 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, provided Canada&#x27;s federal government exclusive authority to legislate in relation to &quot;Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians&quot;.

Wikwemikong Unceded Reserve on Manitoulin Island is subject to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; provisions governing reserves even though its lands were never ceded to the Crown by treaty.

== &quot;Indian Act&quot; ==
The &quot;Indian Act&quot; gives the Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations the right to &quot;determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used is for the use and benefit of the band.&quot; Title to land within the reserve may be transferred to only the band or to individual band members. Reserve lands may not be seized legally, nor is the personal property of a band or a band member living on a reserve subject to &quot;charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band&quot;.

=== Housing loans ===
While the act was intended to protect the Indian holdings, the limitations make it difficult for the reserves and their residents to obtain financing for development and construction, or renovation. To answer this need, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) has created an on-reserve housing loan program. Members of bands may enter into a trust agreement with CMHC, and lenders can receive loans to build or repair houses. In other programs, loans to residents of reserves are guaranteed by the federal government.

Provinces and municipalities may expropriate reserve land if specifically authorized by a provincial or federal law. Few reserves have any economic advantages, such as resource revenues. The revenues of those reserves that do are held in trust by the minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada. Reserve lands and the personal property of bands and resident band members are exempt from all forms of taxation except local taxation.

Corporations owned by members of First Nations are not exempt, however. This exemption has allowed band members operating in proprietorships or partnerships to sell heavily taxed goods, such as cigarettes, on their reserves at prices considerably lower than those at stores off the reserves. Most reserves are self-governed, within the limits already described, under guidelines established by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;.

Due to treaty settlements, some Indian reserves are now incorporated as villages, such as Gitlaxt&#x27;aamiks, British Columbia, which like other Nisga&#x27;a reserves was relieved of that status by the Nisga&#x27;a Treaty. Similarly, the Indian reserves of the Sechelt Indian Band are now Indian government districts.

== Public policy ==
Indian reserves play a very important role in public policy stakeholder consultations, particularly when reserves are located in areas that have valuable natural resources with potential for economic development. Beginning in the 1970s, First Nations gained &quot;recognition of their constitutionally protected rights.&quot; First Nations&#x27; rights are protected by section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. By 2002, (Valiente) First Nations had already &quot;finalised 14 comprehensive land claims and self-government agreements, with numerous others, primarily in northern Canada and British Columbia, at different stages of negotiations.&quot; Land claims and self-government agreements are &quot;modern treaties&quot; and therefore hold constitutional status.

=== CEPA 1999 ===
The &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999&quot; (CEPA), &quot;places aboriginal participation on par with federal ministers and the provinces in the National Advisory Committee.&quot; Among other things, CEPA clarified the term &quot;aboriginal land&quot; in 3 (1): &quot;The definitions in this subsection apply in this Act. &quot;aboriginal land&quot; means (a) reserves, surrendered lands and any other lands that are set apart for the use and benefit of a band and that are subject to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;.&quot; Under sections 46–50 of the CEPA, Environment and Climate Change Canada&#x27;s National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) was initiated. NPRI is the inventory of &quot;pollutants released, disposed of and sent for recycling by facilities across the country&quot;. The NPRI is used by First Nation administrations on reserves, along with other research tools, to monitor pollution. For example, NPRI data showed the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Sarnia, Ontario, was &quot;ground zero for Ontario&#x27;s heaviest load of air pollution.&quot;

== Water quality ==

By December 21, 2017, there were 67 long-term boil-water advisories that had been in effect for longer than a year. These are &quot;public water systems managed by the federal government&quot;. There were also 18 communities that had &quot;water issues for between two and 12 months.&quot;

According to statistics gathered by Health Canada and the First Nations Health Authority, in 2015, there were &quot;162 drinking water advisories in 118 First Nation communities&quot;. In October 2015, Neskantaga First Nation reported that its &quot;20-year boil-water advisory&quot; was &quot;the longest running drinking water advisory in Canada.&quot; Shoal Lake 40 First Nation was under an 18-year boil water advisory.

By 2006, nearly 100 Indian reserves had boil-water advisories and many others had substandard water. Ḵwiḵwa̱sut&#x27;inux̱w Ha̱xwa&#x27;mis First Nation, on Vancouver Island, had a boil-water advisory beginning in 1997. In October 2005, &quot;high &quot;E. coli&quot; levels were found in the Kashechewan First Nation reserve&#x27;s drinking water and chlorine levels had to be increased to &#x27;shock&#x27; levels, causing skin problems and eventually resulting in an evacuation of hundreds of people from the reserve and costing approximately $16 million.&quot;

<text>In computing, a Las Vegas algorithm is a randomized algorithm that always gives correct results; that is, it always produces the correct result or it informs about the failure. However, the runtime of a Las Vegas algorithm differs depending on the input. The usual definition of a Las Vegas algorithm includes the restriction that the &quot;expected&quot; runtime be finite, where the expectation is carried out over the space of random information, or entropy, used in the algorithm. An alternative definition requires that a Las Vegas algorithm always terminates (is effective), but may output a symbol not part of the solution space to indicate failure in finding a solution. The nature of Las Vegas algorithms makes them suitable in situations where the number of possible solutions is limited, and where verifying the correctness of a candidate solution is relatively easy while finding a solution is complex.

Systematic search methods for computationally hard problems, such as some variants of the Davis–Putnam algorithm for propositional satisfiability (SAT), also utilize non-deterministic decisions, and can thus also be considered Las Vegas algorithms.

== History ==
Las Vegas algorithms were introduced by László Babai in 1979, in the context of the graph isomorphism problem, as a dual to Monte Carlo algorithms. Babai introduced the term &quot;Las Vegas algorithm&quot; alongside an example involving coin flips: the algorithm depends on a series of independent coin flips, and there is a small chance of failure (no result). However, in contrast to Monte Carlo algorithms, the Las Vegas algorithm can guarantee the correctness of any reported result.

== Example ==

// Las Vegas algorithm
repeat:
 k = RandInt(n)
 if A[k] == 1,
 return k;
As mentioned above, Las Vegas algorithms always return correct results. The code above illustrates this property. A variable &quot;k&quot; is generated randomly; after &quot;k&quot; is generated, &quot;k&quot; is used to index the array &quot;A&quot;. If this index contains the value 1, then &quot;k&quot; is returned; otherwise, the algorithm repeats this process until it finds 1. Although this Las Vegas algorithm is guaranteed to find the correct answer, it does not have a fixed runtime; due to the randomization (in &quot;line 3&quot; of the above code), it is possible for arbitrarily much time to elapse before the algorithm terminates.

== Definition ==
This section provides the conditions that characterize an algorithm&#x27;s being of Las Vegas type.

An algorithm A is a Las Vegas algorithm for problem class X, if

#whenever for a given problem instance x∈X it returns a solution s, s is guaranteed to be a valid solution of x
#on each given instance x, the run-time of A is a random variable RTA,x

There are three notions of &quot;completeness&quot; for Las Vegas algorithms:

* &quot;complete Las Vegas algorithms&quot; can be guaranteed to solve each solvable problem within run-time t where t is an instance-dependent constant.

Let P(RTA,x ≤ t) denote the probability that A finds a solution for a soluble instance x in time within t, then A is complete exactly if for each x there exists

some t such that P(RTA,x ≤ tmax) = 1.

* &quot;approximately complete Las Vegas algorithms&quot; solve each problem with a probability converging to 1 as the run-time approaches infinity. Thus, A is approximately complete, if for each instance x, limt→∞ P(RTA,x ≤ t) = 1.
* &quot;essentially incomplete Las Vegas algorithms&quot; are Las Vegas algorithms that are not approximately complete.

Approximate completeness is primarily of theoretical interest, as the time limits for finding solutions are usually too large to be of practical use.

=== Application scenarios ===
Las Vegas algorithms have different criteria for the evaluation based on the problem setting. These criteria are divided into three categories with different time limits since Las Vegas algorithms do not have set time complexity. Here are some possible application scenarios:

* Type 1: There are no time limits, which means the algorithm runs until it finds the solution.
* Type 2: There is a time limit tmax for finding the outcome.
* Type 3: The utility of a solution is determined by the time required to find the solution.

(Type 1 and Type 2 are special cases of Type 3.)

For Type 1 where there is no time limit, the average run-time can represent the run-time behavior. This is not the same case for Type 2.

Here, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;RT&quot; ≤ &quot;tmax&quot;), which is the probability of finding a solution within time, describes its run-time behavior.

In case of Type 3, its run-time behavior can only be represented by the run-time distribution function &quot;rtd&quot;: &quot;R&quot; → [0,1] defined as &quot;rtd&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;P&quot;(&quot;RT&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;) or its approximation.

The run-time distribution (RTD) is the distinctive way to describe the run-time behavior of a Las Vegas algorithm.

With this data, we can easily get other criteria such as the mean run-time, standard deviation, median, percentiles, or success probabilities &quot;P&quot;(&quot;RT&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;) for arbitrary time-limits &quot;t&quot;.

== Applications ==
=== Analogy ===
Las Vegas algorithms arise frequently in search problems. For example, one looking for some information online might search related websites for the desired information. The time complexity thus ranges from getting &quot;lucky&quot; and finding the content immediately, to being &quot;unlucky&quot; and spending large amounts of time. Once the right website is found, then there is no possibility of error.

=== Randomized quicksort ===

INPUT: 
 # A is an array of n elements
def randomized_quicksort(A):
 if n == 1:
 return A # A is sorted.
 else:
 i = random.randrange(1, n) # Will take a random number in the range 1~n
 X = A[i] # The pivot element
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Partition A into elements &lt; x, x, and &gt;x # as shown in the figure above.
 Execute Quicksort on A[1 to i-1] and A[i+1 to n].
 Combine the responses in order to obtain a sorted array.&quot;&quot;&quot;
A simple example is randomized quicksort, where the pivot is chosen randomly, and divides the elements into three partitions: elements less than pivot, elements equal to pivot, and elements greater than pivot. QuickSort always generates the solution, which in this case the sorted array. Unfortunately, the time complexity is not that obvious. It turns out that the runtime depends on which element we pick as a pivot.

* The worst case Θ(&quot;n&quot;2) when the pivot is the smallest or the largest element.

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4&lt;br&gt;

* However, through randomization, where the pivot is randomly picked and is exactly a middle value each time, the QuickSort can be done in Θ(&quot;n&quot;log&quot;n&quot;).

:formula_5
:formula_6

The runtime of quicksort depends heavily on how well the pivot is selected. If a value of pivot is either too big or small, the partition will be unbalanced, resulting in a poor runtime efficiency. However, if the value of pivot is near the middle of the array, then the split will be reasonably well balanced, yielding a faster runtime. Since the pivot is randomly picked, the running time will be good most of the time and bad occasionally.

In the case of average case, it is hard to determine since the analysis does not depend on the input distribution but on the random choices that the algorithm makes. The average of quicksort is computed over all possible random choices that the algorithm might make when choosing the pivot.

Although the worst-case runtime is Θ(&quot;n&quot;2), the average-case runtime is Θ(&quot;n&quot;log&quot;n&quot;). It turns out that the worst-case does not happen often. For large values of &quot;n&quot;, the runtime is Θ(&quot;n&quot;log&quot;n&quot;) with a high probability.

Note that the probability that the pivot is the middle value element each time is one out of &quot;n&quot; numbers, which is very rare. However, it is still the same runtime when the split is 10%-90% instead of a 50%–50% because the depth of the recursion tree will still be &quot;O&quot;(log&quot;n&quot;) with &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) times taken each level of recursion.

=== Randomized greedy algorithm for the Eight queens problem ===
The eight queens problem is usually solved with a backtracking algorithm. However, a Las Vegas algorithm can be applied; in fact, it is more efficient than backtracking.

Place 8 queens on a chessboard so that no one attacks another. Remember that a queen attacks other pieces on the same row, column and diagonals.

Assume that &quot;k&quot; rows, 0 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ 8, are successfully occupied by queens.

If &quot;k&quot; = 8, then stop with success. Otherwise, proceed to occupy row &quot;k&quot; + 1.

Calculate all positions on this row not attacked by existing queens. If there are none, then fail. Otherwise, pick one at random, increment &quot;k&quot; and repeat.

Note that the algorithm simply fails if a queen cannot be placed. But the process can be repeated and every time will generate different arrangement.

== Complexity class ==
The complexity class of decision problems that have Las Vegas algorithms with expected polynomial runtime is ZPP.

It turns out that
: formula_7

which is intimately connected with the way Las Vegas algorithms are sometimes constructed. Namely the class RP consists of all decision problems for which a randomized polynomial-time algorithm exists that always answers correctly when the correct answer is &quot;no&quot;, but is allowed to be wrong with a certain probability bounded away from one when the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. When such an algorithm exists for both a problem and its complement (with the answers &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; swapped), the two algorithms can be run simultaneously and repeatedly: run each for a constant number of steps, taking turns, until one of them returns a definitive answer. This is the standard way to construct a Las Vegas algorithm that runs in expected polynomial time. Note that in general there is no worst case upper bound on the run time of a Las Vegas algorithm.

== Optimal Las Vegas algorithm ==
In order to make a Las Vegas algorithm optimal, the expected run time should be minimized. This can be done by:
# The Las Vegas algorithm &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) runs repeatedly for some number &quot;t&quot;1 steps. If &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) stops during the run time then &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is done; otherwise, repeat the process from the beginning for another &quot;t&quot;2 steps, and so on.
# Designing a strategy that is optimal among all strategies for &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), given the full information about the distribution of &quot;TA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

The existence of the optimal strategy might be a fascinating theoretical observation. However, it is not practical in real life because it is not easy to find the information of distribution of &quot;TA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Furthermore, there is no point of running the experiment repeatedly to obtain the information about the distribution since most of the time, the answer is needed only once for any &quot;x&quot;.

== Relation to Monte Carlo algorithms ==
Las Vegas algorithms can be contrasted with Monte Carlo algorithms, in which the resources used are bounded but the answer may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability. A Las Vegas algorithm can be converted into a Monte Carlo algorithm by running it for set time and generating a random answer when it fails to terminate. By an application of Markov&#x27;s inequality, we can set the bound on the probability that the Las Vegas algorithm would go over the fixed limit.

Here is a table comparing Las Vegas and Monte Carlo algorithms:
If a deterministic way to test for correctness is available, then it is possible to turn a Monte Carlo algorithm into a Las Vegas algorithm. However, it is hard to convert a Monte Carlo algorithm to a Las Vegas algorithm without a way to test the algorithm. On the other hand, changing a Las Vegas algorithm to a Monte Carlo algorithm is easy. This can be done by running a Las Vegas algorithm for a specific period of time given by confidence parameter. If the algorithm finds the solution within the time, then it is success and if not then output can simply be &quot;sorry&quot;.

This is an example of Las Vegas and Monte Carlo algorithms for comparison:

Assume that there is an array with the length of even &quot;n&quot;. Half of the entries in the array are 0&#x27;s and the remaining half are 1&#x27;s. The goal here is to find an index that contains a 1.
// Las Vegas algorithm
repeat:
 k = RandInt(n)
 if A[k] == 1,
 return k;
// Monte Carlo algorithm
repeat 300 times:
 k = RandInt(n)
 if A[k] == 1
 return k
return &quot;Failed&quot;
Since Las Vegas does not end until it finds 1 in the array, it does not gamble with the correctness but run-time. On the other hand, Monte Carlo runs 300 times, which means it is impossible to know that Monte Carlo will find &quot;1&quot; in the array within 300 times of loops until it actually executes the code. It might find the solution or not. Therefore, unlike Las Vegas, Monte Carlo does not gamble with run-time but correctness.

<doc id="537530" wikidata="Q726073" url="?curid=537530" title="John McVie">
<text>John Graham McVie (; born 26 November 1945) is a British bass guitarist. He is best known as a member of the rock bands John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers from 1964 to 1967 and Fleetwood Mac since 1967. His surname, combined with that of drummer Mick Fleetwood, was the source for the band&#x27;s name.

He joined Fleetwood Mac shortly after its formation by guitarist Peter Green in 1967, replacing temporary bass guitarist Bob Brunning. McVie and Fleetwood are the only two members of the group to appear on every Fleetwood Mac release, and for over fifty years have been the group&#x27;s last remaining original (or almost original in McVie&#x27;s case) members.

In 1968, McVie married blues pianist and singer Christine Perfect, who became a member of Fleetwood Mac two years later. John and Christine McVie divorced in 1976, but continued working together professionally. During this time the band recorded the album &quot;Rumours&quot;, a major artistic and commercial success that borrowed its title from the turmoil in McVie&#x27;s and other band members&#x27; marriages and relationships.

McVie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 as a member of Fleetwood Mac.

==Early life==
John Graham McVie was born in Ealing, west London, to Reg and Dorothy McVie and attended Walpole Grammar School. He says that he did have a sister, but she died when she was very young. John McVie started playing the trumpet at an early age then, at age 14, he began playing the guitar in local bands, covering songs by the Shadows. He soon realised that his friends were learning lead guitar so he decided to play the bass guitar instead. Initially he just removed the top two (B and E) strings from his guitar to play the bass parts until his father bought him a pink Fender bass guitar, the same as that used by McVie&#x27;s major early musical influence Jet Harris, the Shadows&#x27; bass player.

Soon after leaving school at 17, McVie trained for nine months to be a tax inspector. This coincided with the start of his musical career.

==Career==
McVie&#x27;s first experience making music with a group of like minds was in the back room of a house in Lammas Park Road, Ealing, with his long-term friends John Barnes and Peter Barnes who later went on to form a group called the Strangers performing Shadows covers.

McVie&#x27;s first job as a bass player was in a band called the Krewsaders, formed by boys living in the same street as McVie in Ealing, West London. The Krewsaders played mainly at weddings and parties, covering songs from the Shadows.

McVie is listed at number 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the fifty greatest bassists of all time.

===John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers===
Around the time of McVie&#x27;s tenure as a tax inspector, John Mayall began forming a Chicago-style blues band, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. Initially Mayall wanted to recruit bass player Cliff Barton of the Cyril Davies All Stars for the rhythm section of his new band. Barton declined, however, but gave him McVie&#x27;s phone number, urging Mayall to give the talented young bass player a chance in the Bluesbreakers. Mayall contacted McVie, and asked him to audition for his band. Soon thereafter, McVie got an offer to play bass in the Bluesbreakers. McVie accepted while still holding down his daytime job for a further nine months before becoming a musician full-time. Under Mayall&#x27;s tutelage, McVie, not having had any formal training in music, learned to play the blues mainly by listening to B.B. King and Willie Dixon records given to him by Mayall. McVie was the band&#x27;s bassist for four and a half years. During that time he was fired and re-hired several times.
One of his temporary replacements was Jack Bruce.

===Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood===
In 1966, a young Peter Green was asked to join Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers as the band&#x27;s new lead guitar player, after Eric Clapton, the third guitarist with the band (after Bernie Watson and then Roger Dean), had left. Some time later, after the recording of &quot;A Hard Road&quot;, drummer Aynsley Dunbar was replaced by Mick Fleetwood. Green, McVie, and Fleetwood quickly forged a strong personal relationship, and when John Mayall gave Green some free studio time for his birthday, Green asked McVie and Fleetwood to join him for a recording session. Produced by Mike Vernon, they recorded three tracks together, &quot;Curly&quot;, &quot;Rubber Duck&quot;, and an instrumental called &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;. Later the same year, after having been replaced by Mick Taylor in the Bluesbreakers, Green opted to form his own band, which he called &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; after his preferred rhythm section (Fleetwood and McVie). Mick Fleetwood immediately joined Green&#x27;s new band, having been dismissed earlier from the Bluesbreakers for drunkenness. However, McVie initially was reluctant to join Fleetwood Mac, not wanting to leave the security and well-paid job in the Bluesbreakers, forcing Green to temporarily hire a bassist named Bob Brunning. A few weeks later McVie changed his mind, however, as he felt that The Bluesbreakers musical direction were shifting too much towards jazz, and he joined Fleetwood Mac in September 1967.

===Fleetwood Mac===
With McVie now in Fleetwood Mac, the band recorded its first album, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, in the following months. The album was released in February 1968, and became an immediate national hit, establishing Fleetwood Mac as a major part in the English Blues movement. Fleetwood Mac started playing live gigs in blues clubs and pubs throughout England, and became a household name in the national blues circuit. In the next three years, the band scored a string of hits in the UK and also enjoyed success in continental Europe.

===Christine Perfect===
While on tour, Fleetwood Mac would often share venues with fellow blues band Chicken Shack. It was on one such occasion that McVie met his future first wife, the lead singer and piano player of Chicken Shack, Christine Perfect. Following a brief romance of, it has been said, only two weeks, McVie and Perfect got married with Peter Green as best man. With the couple being unable to spend much time together because of the constant touring with their bands, Christine (now McVie) quit Chicken Shack to become a housewife to spend more time with John. However, following the departure of Peter Green from Fleetwood Mac in 1970, McVie successfully persuaded Christine to join him in Fleetwood Mac.

===International success and personal life===

After 1970, Fleetwood Mac went through several different line-ups, which occasionally became the source of friction and unease within the band. In addition, frequent touring as well as his heavy drinking began to put some strain on his marriage to Christine. In 1974, the McVies, along with the other members of Fleetwood Mac, moved to Los Angeles, where they lived briefly with John Mayall.
In 1975, Fleetwood Mac achieved enormous worldwide success after recruiting American singer-songwriter duo Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. However, on the heels of the band&#x27;s success followed serious marital problems for the McVies, and in 1976, during the recording of &quot;Rumours&quot;, John and Christine McVie&#x27;s marriage unravelled and the couple divorced the same year. As a way to put behind the hurt and final dissolution, several of Christine&#x27;s songs on this album were about John McVie, particularly &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;. John McVie remarried in 1978 to Julie Ann Reubens, but still continued to drink heavily.

In 1981, McVie agreed to go on the road with the Bluesbreakers again for their reunion tour with John Mayall, Mick Taylor, and Colin Allen. During 1982 the band toured America, Asia and Australia (McVie did not take part in the European Tour in 1983 and was replaced by Steve Thompson).

An alcohol-induced seizure in 1987 finally prompted McVie to stop drinking altogether and he has been sober ever since. In 1989, McVie&#x27;s wife Julie Ann gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Molly Elizabeth McVie. In his spare time, McVie is a sailing enthusiast, and he nearly got lost at least once on a Pacific voyage.

In October 2013, McVie was diagnosed with colon cancer and began treatment. He continued to play with the band during their 2014 On With the Show tour following an improvement in his condition. In 2017, it was reported that McVie&#x27;s colon cancer was completely cleared.

<doc id="537535" wikidata="Q7834250" url="?curid=537535" title="Transgressive fiction">
<text>Transgressive fiction is a genre of literature which focuses on characters who feel confined by the norms and expectations of society and who break free of those confines in unusual or illicit ways.

==Literary context==
Because they are rebelling against the basic norms of society, protagonists of transgressive fiction may seem mentally ill, anti-social, or nihilistic. The genre deals extensively with taboo subject matters such as drugs, sexual activity, violence, incest, pedophilia, and crime. The genre of &quot;transgressive fiction&quot; was defined by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; literary critic Michael Silverblatt.

Michel Foucault&#x27;s essay &quot;A Preface to Transgression&quot; (1963) provides an important methodological origin for the concept of transgression in literature. The essay uses &quot;Story of the Eye&quot; by Georges Bataille as an example of transgressive fiction.

Rene Chun, a journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described transgressive fiction:
The genre has been the subject of controversy, and many forerunners of transgressive fiction, including William S. Burroughs and Hubert Selby Jr., have been the subjects of obscenity trials.

Transgressive fiction shares similarities with splatterpunk, noir, and erotic fiction in its willingness to portray forbidden behaviors and shock readers. But it differs in that protagonists often pursue means to better themselves and their surroundings—albeit unusual and extreme ones. Much transgressive fiction deals with searches for self-identity, inner peace, or personal freedom. Unbound by usual restrictions of taste and literary convention, its proponents claim that transgressive fiction is capable of incisive social commentary.

==History==
The basic ideas of transgressive fiction are by no means new. Many works that are now considered classics dealt with controversial themes and harshly criticized societal norms. Early examples include the scandalous writing of the Marquis de Sade and the Comte de Lautréamont&#x27;s &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; (1869). French author Émile Zola&#x27;s works about social conditions and &quot;bad behavior&quot; are examples, as are Russian Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novels &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866) and &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (1864) and Norwegian Knut Hamsun&#x27;s psychologically-driven &quot;Hunger&quot; (1890). Sexual extravagance can be seen in two of the earliest European novels, the &quot;Satyricon&quot; and &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, and also (with disclaimers) &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; and some of the excesses of early Gothic fiction.

A simpler, more literal example of transgressive fiction is Kate Chopin&#x27;s &quot;The Awakening&quot;, in which a married woman, feeling confined by the gender constructs of her society and pressures imposed upon her by her family and friends to be keen in her duties as a mother and wife, leaves her family and pursues extramarital relationships. Commenting on gender roles of the late 19th century, &quot;The Awakening&quot; faced major criticism for its depiction of a woman being unfaithful to her family, despite the fact that Chopin had written several similar short stories prior to &quot;Awakening&quot;&#x27;s publication. It is now considered to be a landmark of early feminist literature.

The early development of the genre was anticipated in the work of early 20th century writers such as Octave Mirbeau, Georges Bataille, and Arthur Schnitzler, who explored psychosexual development.

On 6 December 1933, US federal judge John M. Woolsey overturned the federal ban on James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The book was banned in the US due to what the government claimed was obscenity, specifically parts of Molly Bloom&#x27;s &quot;soliloquy&quot; at the end of the book. Random House Inc. challenged the claim of obscenity in federal court and was granted permission to print the book in the US. Judge Woolsey&#x27;s explanation for his removal of the ban is often quoted: &quot;It is only with the normal person that the law is concerned.&quot;

In the late 1950s, American publisher Grove Press, under publisher Barney Rosset, began releasing decades-old novels that had been unpublished in most of the English-speaking world for many years due to controversial subject matter. Two of these works, &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s tale of an upper class woman&#x27;s affair with a working class man) and &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; (Henry Miller&#x27;s sexual odyssey), were the subject of landmark obscenity trials (&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was also tried in the UK and Austria). Both books were ruled not obscene and forced the US courts to weigh the merit of literature that would have once been instantly deemed pornographic (see Miller test). Similarly, the author Vladimir Nabokov published &quot;Lolita&quot; in 1955 to a great deal of controversy due to the hebephilia that occurs between the book&#x27;s main characters, Humbert Humbert and Lolita. The transgressive nature of this subject has made &quot;Lolita&quot; a book often found on the list of books banned by governments and the list of most commonly challenged books in the United States.

Grove Press also published the explicit works of Beat writers, which led to two more obscenity trials. The first concerned &quot;Howl&quot;, Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s 1955 poem which celebrated American counterculture and decried hypocrisy and emptiness in mainstream society. The second concerned William S. Burroughs&#x27; hallucinatory, satirical novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1959). Both works contained what were considered lewd descriptions of body parts and sexual acts. Grove also published Hubert Selby Jr.&#x27;s anecdotal novel &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1964), known for its gritty portrayals of criminals, and sex workers and its crude, slang-inspired prose. &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; was tried as obscene in the UK. Grove Press won all these trials, and the victories paved the way both for transgressive fiction to be published legally, as well as bringing attention to these works.

In the 1970s and &#x27;80s, an entire underground of transgressive fiction flourished. Its biggest stars included J. G. Ballard, a British writer known for his strange and frightening dystopian novels; Kathy Acker, an American known for her sex-positive feminist fiction; and Charles Bukowski, an American known for his tales of womanizing, drinking, and gambling. The notorious 1971 film version of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, contained scenes of rape and &quot;ultraviolence&quot; by a futuristic youth gang complete with its own argot, and was a major influence on popular culture; it was subsequently withdrawn in the UK, and heavily censored in the US.

In the 1990s, the rise of alternative rock and its distinctly downbeat subculture opened the door for transgressive writers to become more influential and commercially successful than ever before. This is exemplified by the influence of Canadian Douglas Coupland&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot;, which explored the economically-bleak and apocalypse-fixated worldview of Coupland&#x27;s age group. The novel popularized the term generation X to describe this age demographic. Other influential authors of this decade include Bret Easton Ellis, known for novels about depraved yuppies; Irvine Welsh, known for his portrayals of Scotland&#x27;s drug-addicted working class youth; and Chuck Palahniuk, known for his characters&#x27; bizarre attempts to escape bland consumer culture. Both of Elizabeth Young&#x27;s volumes of literary criticism from this period deal extensively and exclusively with this range of authors and the contexts in which their works can be viewed.

The early 21st century saw the rise of writers like Rupert Thomson, R. D. Ronald and Kelly Braffet with their protagonists further pushing the criminal, sexual, violent, narcotic, self-harm, anti-social and mental illness related subject matter taboos from the shadows of the transgressive umbrella into the forefront of mainstream fiction. Ronald&#x27;s novels &quot;The Elephant Tree&quot; and &quot;The Zombie Room&quot; are based in the fictional city of Garden Heights, providing a fresh, contemporary melting pot to showcase the amalgamation of UK and US cultural and societal dissatisfaction and frustration, that had previously been portrayed very differently.

In the UK, the genre owes a considerable influence to &quot;working class literature&quot;, which often portrays characters trying to escape poverty by inventive means, while in the US, the genre focuses more on middle class characters trying to escape the emotional and spiritual limitations of their lifestyle.

<text>The Quinnipiac were a historical Indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands. They lived in present-day New Haven County, Connecticut, along the Quinnipiac River. Their primary village, also called Quinnipiac, was where New Haven, Connecticut is today.

== Name ==
The Quinnipiac name translates as &quot;Long-water people.&quot; It was also spelled Quienepiage, Quenepiake, Qunnipiéuk, Qunnipiuck, Qunnipiug, Quinnpiipuck, Quunnipieuck, and Qvinipiak.

== Language ==
The Quinnipiac and several neighboring tribes in central Connecticut and central Long Island all spoke the Quiripi language. This Eastern Algonquian language went extinct in the late 19th century. Reverend Abraham Pierson translated the catechism into Quiripi in 1658. Reverend Ezra Stiles and Thomas Jefferson both collected word lists in the language.

== Political structure ==
Historian Edward Manning Ruttenber suggested that the Quinnipiac were part of the Wappinger confederacy, but the colonist Daniel Gookin wrote that they were part of the Pequot. Their leader was called a &quot;sachem&quot;, and historians invented the term &quot;sachemdom&quot; to describe political units led by a sachem. The Totoket people were part of the Quinnipiac sachemdom. The Hammonasset were likely also part of the Quinnipiac sachemdom.

== History ==
=== 17th century ===

The Puritans established the first Indian Reservation in 1638. Located near New Haven, Connecticut, the reserve was for the Quinnipiac, but only included 1,200 acres, a small portion of their original territory. The reservation&#x27;s residents, described as &quot;free&quot; Indians, were placed under the authority of an English agent. They were not allowed to sell or abandon that land, and Native peoples from other tribes were not allowed to visit.

From around 1651 to 1669, Reverend Abraham Pierson, a Congregational minister, proselytized the Quinnipiac near Branford, Connecticut. He translated Christian texts into the Quiripi language. Missionization was not very successful, and the tribe showed &quot;a perverse contempt&quot; for the church.

=== 18th century ===
In 1730, there were an estimated 250 to 300 Quinnipiac. In 1768, some Quinnipiac left their reservation and joined the Tunxi near Farmington, Connecticut. In 1774, only an estimated 38 Quinnipiac survived. They were part of the large Mahican tribe, whose descendants ultimately migrated to Wisconsin with the Stockbridge Munsee Community and Brotherton Indian Community.

<text>Phalloidin belongs to a class of toxins called phallotoxins, which are found in the death cap mushroom &quot;(Amanita phalloides)&quot;. It is a rigid bicyclic heptapeptide that is lethal after a few days when injected into the bloodstream. The major symptom of phalloidin poisoning is acute hunger due to the destruction of liver cells. It functions by binding and stabilizing filamentous actin (F-actin) and effectively prevents the depolymerization of actin fibers. Due to its tight and selective binding to F-actin, derivatives of phalloidin containing fluorescent tags are used widely in microscopy to visualize F-actin in biomedical research.

==Discovery and background==
Phalloidin was one of the first cyclic peptides to be discovered. It was isolated from the death cap mushroom and crystallized by Feodor Lynen and Ulrich Wieland in 1937. Its structure is unusual in that it contains a cysteine-tryptophan linkage to form a bicyclic heptapeptide. This linkage had not been characterized before and makes the structure elucidation of phalloidin significantly more difficult. They determined the presence of the sulfur atom using UV spectroscopy and found that this ring structure had a slightly shifted wavelength. Raney nickel experiments confirmed the presence of sulfur in the tryptophan ring. The researchers found the desulfurized phalloidin was still circular, which demonstrated that the structure of phalloidin is normally bicyclic. Once linearized, the amino acid sequence of de-sulfurized phalloidin was elucidated through Edman degradation by Wieland and Schön in 1955.

Due to its high affinity for actin, scientists discovered its potential use as a staining reagent for effective visualization of actin in microscopy. Derivatives conjugated with fluorophores are sold widely. Because of its ability to selectively bind filamentous actin (F-actin) and not actin monomers (G-actin), fluorescently labeled phalloidin is more effective than antibodies against actin.

==Synthesis==

===Biosynthesis===
Phalloidin is a bicyclic heptapeptide containing an unusual cysteine-tryptophan linkage. The gene coding for synthesis of phalloidin is part of the MSDIN family in the Death Cap mushroom and codes for a 34 amino acid propeptide. A proline residue flanks the seven-residue region that will later become phalloidin. After translation, the peptide must be proteolyticly excised, cyclized, hydroxylated, Trp-Cys cross-linked to form tryptathionine, and epimerized to form a D-Thr. The order and exact biochemical mechanism for these steps is not yet fully understood. The current belief is that the necessary biosynthetic genes are clustered near the MSDIN genes.

The first post-translational modification of the 34-mer is proteolytic cleavage via a prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) to remove the 10-amino acid &quot;leader&quot; peptide. The POP then cyclizes the heptapeptide Ala-Trp-Leu-Ala-Thr-Cys-Pro by transpeptidation between amino acid 1 (Ala) and amino acid 7 (Pro). It is believed that the formation of tryptathionine through Trp-Cys cross-linking occurs next.

===Chemical synthesis===
Since phalloidin is exploited for its ability to bind and stabilize actin polymers but cells cannot readily uptake it, scientists have found phalloidin derivatives to be more useful in research. Essentially, it follows typical small peptide synthesis, using hydroxyl-proline. The major difficulty in synthesis is the formation of the tryptathionine bond (cysteine - tryptophan cross-linkage).

Below is the general synthetic mechanism carried out by Anderson et al. in 2005 for the solid phase synthesis of ala7-phalloidin, which differs at residue 7 from phalloidin as indicated below. THPP stands for tetrahydropyranyl polystyrene linker, which is used to connect the molecule with the solid support during synthesis. Note that the synthesis below is simply a general scheme to show the order of bond formation to connect the starting materials. Ala7-phalloidin as well as many other similar variants of phalloidin are useful to increase cell uptake relative to phalloidin and to attach a fluorophore to aid in the visualization of F-actin in microscopy.

The first total synthesis of phalloidin was achieved through a combination of solid phase and solution phase synthesis (Baosheng Liu and Jianheng Zhang, United States Patent, US 8,569,452 B2). The physical and chemical properties of the synthetic phalloidin are the same as the naturally occurring phalloidin.

==Mechanism of action==
 Phalloidin binds F-actin, preventing its depolymerization and poisoning the cell. Phalloidin binds specifically at the interface between F-actin subunits, locking adjacent subunits together. Phalloidin, a bicyclic heptapeptide, binds to actin filaments much more tightly than to actin monomers, leading to a decrease in the rate constant for the dissociation of actin subunits from filament ends, which essentially stabilizes actin filaments through the prevention of filament depolymerization. Moreover, phalloidin is found to inhibit the ATP hydrolysis activity of F-actin. Thus, phalloidin traps actin monomers in a conformation distinct from G-actin and it stabilizes the structure of F-actin by greatly reducing the rate constant for monomer dissociation, an event associated with the trapping of ADP. Overall, phalloidin is found to react stoichiometrically with actin, strongly promote actin polymerization, and stabilize actin polymers.

Phalloidin functions differently at various concentrations in cells. When introduced into the cytoplasm at low concentrations, phalloidin recruits the less polymerized forms of cytoplasmic actin as well as filamin into stable &quot;islands&quot; of aggregated actin polymers, yet it does not interfere with stress fibers, i.e. thick bundles of microfilaments. Wehland &quot;et al.&quot; also notes that at higher concentrations, phalloidin induces cellular contraction.

==Symptoms==
Soon after its discovery, scientists injected phalloidin into mice and discovered its LD50 is 2 mg/kg via IP injection. When exposed to the minimum lethal dose, it took several days for these mice to die. The only apparent side effect of phalloidin poisoning is extreme hunger. This is because phalloidin is only taken up by the liver via bile salt membrane transport proteins. Once inside the liver, phalloidin binds F-actin, preventing its depolymerization. It takes time for this process to destroy the liver cells. The kidneys can also take up phalloidin, but not as effectively as the liver. Here, phalloidin causes nephrosis.

==Use as an imaging tool==

The properties of phalloidin make it a useful tool for investigating the distribution of F-actin in cells by labeling phalloidin with fluorescent analogs and using them to stain actin filaments for light microscopy. Fluorescent derivatives of phalloidin have turned out to be enormously useful in localizing actin filaments in living or fixed cells as well as for visualizing individual actin filaments &quot;in vitro&quot;. A high-resolution technique was developed to detect F-actin at the light and electron microscopic levels by using phalloidin conjugated to the fluorophore eosin which acts as the fluorescent tag. In this method known as fluorescence photo-oxidation, fluorescent molecules can be utilized to drive the oxidation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) to create a reaction product that can be rendered electron dense and detectable by electron microscopy. The amount of fluorescence visualized can be used as a quantitative measure of the amount of filamentous actin there is in cells if saturating quantities of fluorescent phalloidin are used. Consequently, immunofluorescence microscopy along with microinjection of phalloidin can be used to evaluate the direct and indirect functions of cytoplasmic actin in its different stages of polymer formation. Therefore, fluorescent phalloidin can be used as an important tool in the study of actin networks at high resolution.

==Uses and limitations==

Phalloidin is much smaller than an antibody that would typically be used to label cellular proteins for fluorescent microscopy which allows for much denser labeling of filamentous actin and much more detailed images can be acquired particularly at higher resolutions.

Unmodified phalloidins do not permeate cell membranes, making them less effective in experiments with living cells. Derivatives of phalloidin with greatly increased cell permeability have been synthesized.

Cells treated with phalloidins exhibit a number of toxic effects and frequently die. Furthermore, it is important to note that phalloidin-treated cells will have greater levels of actin associated with their plasma membranes, and the microinjection of phalloidin into living cells will change actin distribution as well as cell motility.
