<text>USS &quot;Stump&quot; (DD-978) was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. The USS &quot;Stump&quot; was decommissioned and stricken on 22 October 2004.

==History==
&quot;Stump&quot; was laid down 25 August 1975, launched 29 January 1977, and commissioned on 19 August 1978. The ship was named after Admiral Felix Stump, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command from 1953 to 1958.

&quot;Stump&quot;&#x27;s 1980 maiden deployment was to the Mediterranean, serving as flagship for Destroyer Squadron 14. &quot;Stump&quot; conducted Black Sea operations, port visits and extensive undersea warfare (USW) operations. As a result of her outstanding performance, &quot;Stump&quot; was awarded the &quot;Hookem Award&quot; for USW excellence by the commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet.

A year later, &quot;Stump&quot; deployed as south Atlantic flagship for UNITAS XXII. It was on this cruise that &quot;Stump&quot; obtained its mascot Felix, a bluefronted Amazon parrot, during a port visit to Brazil. Stump was the first Spruance class ship to traverse the inland waterway of Chile.

In October 1982, &quot;Stump&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf as a part of the Middle East Force to conduct radar picket operations. Returning home in March 1983, she participated in Solid Shield &#x27;83, a complex exercise involving U.S. NATO ships and the U.S. Air Force.
The ship went through a ten-month major overhaul at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She was the first Spruance class ship to go outside Mississippi for a major overhaul.
March 1984 was highlighted by &quot;Stump&quot;&#x27;s adoption as state flagship of West Virginia. &quot;Stump&quot; then traveled to New Orleans as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s host ship for the 1984 World&#x27;s Fair. Also in 1984, &quot;Stump&quot; won the James F. Chezek Memorial Gunnery Award by shooting a 496 out of 500 during naval gunfire support qualifications.

Admiral W. L. McDonald, Commander in Chief U.S. Atlantic Fleet, embarked in March 1985 for CARIBOPS &#x27;85. While in the Caribbean, &quot;Stump&quot; again shot naval gunfire support qualifications and scored 495 out of 500, winning the Atlantic Fleet &quot;Top Gun&quot; award for an unprecedented second year in a row. &quot;Stump&quot; then deployed for UNITAS XXVI/WATC &#x27;85. During the deployment, &quot;Stump&quot; showed the flag in port visits to eight South American nations and six West African nations. 1986 was significant for two reasons. First, &quot;Stump&quot; was chosen to become the test platform for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s newest hull-mounted sonar, the AN/SQS-53C. Using advanced technology, the &quot;53C&quot; would be the sonar for the U.S. Navy combatants well into the twenty-first century. Secondly, &quot;Stump&quot; was awarded the COMDESRON TEN Battle &quot;E&quot; Efficiency award for overall excellence.

In 1988, &quot;Stump&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the carrier battle group (MED 3–88). In April, and on 48-hour notice, &quot;Stump&quot; was directed to detach and proceed to the Persian Gulf to replace the which had suffered extensive damage from a naval mine explosion. After returning from the Gulf &quot;Stump&quot; was dispatched to meet and escort the &quot;Mighty Savant II&quot; carrying the damaged &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; from the Suez canal to Rota Spain during part of its return journey to the US for repairs. &quot;Stump&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia, in August. &quot;Stump&quot; was underway again in October for six weeks of Caribbean law enforcement operations where she performed a rescue of a sinking drug runner and recovered a shipment of Marijuana, 80 bales of Marijuana were recovered for destruction before the boat sank. &quot;Stump&quot; was also credited with the identification of a low flying plane whose inspection upon landing in the US accounted for the recovery of several hundred kilos of Cocaine. In December, &quot;Stump&quot; was presented her second consecutive Battle &quot;E&quot; award by Rear Admiral Donnell, commander of the Naval Surface Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet. In October 1989, &quot;Stump&quot; again deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the carrier battle group (MED 1–90). During this deployment, &quot;Stump&quot; was extremely successful in conducting anti-submarine warfare exercises and was once again presented the &quot;Hookem&quot; award for excellence in undersea warfare.

===1990s===
In August 1990, &quot;Stump&quot; transited to Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans, Louisiana, for overhaul and major combat systems upgrade. She received the Vertical Launch System (VLS) for the BGM-109 Tomahawk missile. &quot;Stump&quot; also received the integrated AN/SQQ-89 USW system.

In November 1992, &quot;Stump&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf and Northern Red Sea as part of MEF (1–93) to serve as a ready strike platform. The highlight of the deployment was the Tomahawk missile strike launched against Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch on 17 January 1993.

In July 1994, &quot;Stump&quot; again deployed to South America for UNITAS XXXV serving as the flagship for the commander of the U.S. South Atlantic Force. &quot;Stump&quot; re-visited eight South American nations, as well as completing another transit of the Chilean inland waterway.

In February 1995, &quot;Stump&quot; deployed to the Caribbean Sea in support of counter drug operations, transiting the Panama Canal. During this period &quot;Stump&quot; participated in a search and rescue mission in the Pacific. In cooperation with a Colombian Coast Guard cutter, &quot;Stump&quot; located and recovered a survivor of a wrecked Colombian vessel. &quot;Stump&quot; returned in April 1995.

As part of a reorganization announced in mid-1995 of the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s surface combatant ships into six battle groups, nine destroyer squadrons and a new Western Hemisphere Group, &quot;Stump&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron Two. The reorganization was to be phased in over the summer and take effect on 31 August, with homeport shifts to occur through 1998.

&quot;Stump&quot; deployed in August 1996 for a Middle Eastern Force cruise to conduct maritime interception operations and act as ready strike destroyer in the Persian Gulf. &quot;Stump&quot; relieved on 28 September as the maritime interception operations/strike platform in the northern Persian Gulf. While in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Stump&quot; completed over 40 boardings in support of maritime interdiction operations and participated in 11 Persian Gulf Tomahawk exercises, including one as launch area coordinator. A mainstay during this deployment, &quot;Stump&quot; remained underway for over eighty percent of the time she was in the Persian Gulf.

Following the return from her Middle Eastern Force deployment in February 1997, &quot;Stump&quot; conducted an extensive dry-docking selected restricted availability and immediately commenced a training cycle which culminated in a final evaluation period. In January 1998 &quot;Stump&quot; commenced work-ups for its upcoming Sixth Fleet deployment by participating in COMPTUEX and JTFEX as part of the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; carrier battle group.

In March 1998 the &quot;Sara Ann&quot; (a fishing trawler) was operating off the Virginia Capes when the seas became too much and she started taking on water. &quot;Stump&quot;, while conducting routine operations on 17 April 1998, was informed by United States Coast Guard Station Portsmouth that the &quot;Sara Ann&quot; was in distress. &quot;Stump&quot; subsequently rescued four civilians about 65 nautical miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. &quot;Stump&quot; provided safe passage back to Norfolk, Virginia.

&quot;Stump&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean as part of Sixth Fleet in June 1998. &quot;Stump&quot;, as part of Destroyer Squadron Two, joined five other nations and other U.S. Navy warships in the central Mediterranean for the execution of SHAREM 125, from 9 to 15 July 1998. SHAREM 125 was the latest in a series of SHAREM exercises designed to test and evaluate undersea warfare tactics, weapons, sensors and procedures. SHAREM is an established in 1969 to continuously improve the quality of undersea warfare.

===2000s===
&quot;Stump&quot; took part in the Fleet Battle Experiment Hotel (FBE-H) which was conducted by units of the U.S. 2nd Fleet and personnel of the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) from 28 August to 12 September 2000 off the Virginia Capes and in the Gulf of Mexico. This was the eighth in a series of fleet battle experiments designed to evaluate new naval warfare concepts and technological capabilities. Under U.S. Joint Forces Command&#x27;s overarching experiment, &quot;Millennium Challenge 00&quot;, FBE-H ran concurrently with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Joint Contingency Force Advanced Warfighting Experiment, the U.S. Air Force Joint Contingency Force Experiment 2000 and the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Millennium Dragon.

The focus of FBE-H was the application of network-centric operations in gaining and sustaining access in support of follow-on joint operations. Access denial was expected to be the focus of any potential adversary&#x27;s strategy. Specifically, FBE-H further developed NWDC&#x27;s draft Access Concept entitled &quot;Poseidon&#x27;s Presence&quot;. In addition, the NATO exercise &quot;Unified Spirit&quot; ran concurrently with the JTFEX, with forces from Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the United Kingdom playing major roles.

&quot;Stump&quot; deployed in late November 2000 with the carrier battle group. Prior to that, &quot;Stump&quot; took part in Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 01-1, to certify the carrier battle group for deployment. This was the first deployment for &quot;Truman,&quot; which had been commissioned in 1998. The deployment included extensive operations in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and primarily the Persian Gulf. While operating in the Persian Gulf, the &quot;Truman&quot; battle group enforced United Nations sanctions against Iraq by diverting 22 vessels with more than $5 million of suspected contraband cargo. Throughout the deployment, the battle group also participated in numerous international exercises, including Arabian Gauntlet, an 11-nation exercise that involved more than 20 ships. Additionally, U.S. sailors worked with military forces from Oman, Jordan, Tunisia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, improving interoperability and strengthening relationships with those countries. &quot;Stump&quot;, along with the rest of the battle group ships returned home on 24 May 2001.

In mid-October 2003 &quot;Stump&quot; operated off the coast of Argentina with the frigate as part of the annual UNITAS exercise which involved naval forces from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Spain and Uruguay.

=== Deployments and ports of call ===
MED-MEF 3–88:
Rota Spain, Ibiza Spain, Marseilles France, Cavaliere France, Genoa Italy, ASU Bahrain, with a brief stop for Suez Canal traffic in Port Said Egypt and a brief stop for fuel in Djibouti.

==Fate==
&quot;Stump&quot; was decommissioned 22 October 2004. Admiral Stump&#x27;s great grandson, John Stump III served on the decommissioning crew in 2004. She was laid up at the inactive ships maintenance facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and sunk as a target along with her sister, off the coast of North Carolina on 7 June 2006.

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The distinguished naval career of Admiral Felix Stump is reflected in the ship&#x27;s coat of arms.

The many decorations received by Admiral Stump for his exemplary service in the Pacific Theater during World War II are represented in the shield. The blue silhouette cross refers to the Navy Cross twice awarded him while in command of Carrier Division 24; the white central star denotes the Silver Star Medal awarded &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action&quot; against enemy-held islands. The Legion of Merit (which he was awarded three times) is indicated by the crossed arrows in scarlet and white. The U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal, received for exceptionally meritorious services as commander of a combined operations center during the early part of the war, is represented by the colors scarlet, white and blue, the colors of the suspension ribbon of the medal. The four smaller stars in gold are in recognition of the attainment of the rank of admiral. The gold shield is symbolic of knowledge and achievement.

Admiral Stump&#x27;s navy career, his noted boldness, and his service aboard six aircraft carriers are presented by the griffin holding an anchor.

<text>USS &quot;Conolly&quot; (DD-979), named for Admiral Richard Lansing Conolly USN, was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi.

==History==
&quot;Conolly&quot; was laid down 29 September 1975, launched 19 February 1977, and commissioned 14 October 1978.

===1980s===

From August to December 1980, &quot;Conolly&quot; deployed as part of the Middle East Force. She deployed as part of this force again from October 1981 to February 1982. In approximately May 1982, &quot;Conolly&quot; cruised to the U.S. Virgin Islands from U.S. Naval Base Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. While in the USVI, &quot;Conolly&quot; suffered a cracked bow sonar dome that required her return, under her own power, to Newport News Shipyards for repairs. While in route to Newport News, &quot;Conolly&quot; experienced a fire in one of the engineering spaces, which the ship’s damage control fire fighters promptly contained. Upon arrival in Newport News, &quot;Conolly&quot; was repaired in dry docks. In September 1982, she deployed to the Mediterranean including operations off the coast of Lebanon.

In June 1983 &quot;Conolly&quot; deployed again participating in UNITAS XXIV, an annual exercise working with partner navies in South America. &quot;Conolly&quot; made multiple port visits and worked with a variety of South American navies before returning home in December of the same year. &quot;Conolly&quot; was the flagship for the cruise, with the staff of Commander, South Atlantic (COMSOLANT), Rear Admiral Clint Taylor, USN, embarked.

Due to equipment casualties in the engineering plant while on the east coast of Chile, the crew had to repair in place the pneumatic clutch-brake assemblies on the two forward gas turbine engines, the second repair having to be completed at sea en route Montevideo, Uruguay. Once in port, the damaged LM-2500 Gas Turbine Main Engine was replaced in 82 hours, using a large floating crane in the port facility.

In addition to the UNITAS cruise, &quot;Conolly&quot; left Brazil in November and sailed, initially in company with , east to conduct a West African Training Cruise (WATC). &quot;Conolly&quot; visited Liberville, Gabon; Lagos, Nigeria; Monrovia, Liberia and finally Dakar, Senegal, before transiting west to Roosevelt Roads, PR for a refueling stop before returning to her homeport of Norfolk, VA in mid-December, 1983.

While sailing from Brazil, &quot;Conolly&quot; was required to conduct a transfer of fuel, while underway, to the &quot;Jesse L. Brown&quot;, so that ship would have sufficient fuel to make her port call in Equatorial Guinea. &quot;Conolly&quot; was the first &quot;Spruance&quot;-class vessel to complete such a task, which was not an assigned capability for the ships. Approximately 30,000 gallons were sent to the &quot;Brown&quot; using 2&quot; fire hoses to deliver the fuel, taking about 4 hours.

In February, 1984, &quot;Conolly&quot; sailed to Portland, ME, to enter a regular overhaul (ROH) at the newly opened Bath Iron Works facility. The overhaul lasted 10 months, during which &quot;Conolly&quot; was fitted with the Tomahawk Weapons System. Also installed was the MK 15 Close in Weapons System and the Mk 23 Target Acquisition System. During the yard period, Commander Harry Maixner was relieved by Commander Gary Voorheis as Captain of the ship.

In October 1985 &quot;Conolly&quot; once again deployed as part of the Middle East Force. During this deployment &quot;Conolly&quot; was involved in the boarding of an American flagged ship by the Iranian Navy. She returned from this deployment in April 1986. In June 1987 she made another deployment to the Mediterranean and followed this up with two more deployments in 1989 as part of the Middle East Force, and 1992 MIF (Maritime Interception Force)during Iraq war.

===1990s===
&quot;Conolly&quot; spent January 1991 at Metro Machine (now General Dynamics NASSCO) in Norfolk, Virginia for a regular overhaul (ROH).

In 1993, &quot;Conolly&quot; was deployed in support of Operation Uphold Democracy, enforcing United Nations sanctions against Haiti.

From 6 to 10 June 1994, &quot;Conolly&quot; participated in World War II commemoration activities at Cavalaire-sur-Mer, France.

That same year, &quot;Conolly&quot; deployed to the Arabian Peninsula, conducting maritime interception operations in the Red Sea in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. During that deployment, on 12 July 1994, &quot;Conolly&quot; came to the rescue of sixty-two crewmembers of the Panamanian-registered ferry &quot;Al Loloa&quot; following a fire on board the ferry. &quot;Conolly&quot; answered the vessel&#x27;s distress call and proceeded to the scene of the fire. Sixty-one of the ferry&#x27;s all Egyptian crew had already abandoned ship and were found safe in five life rafts. A survey team from &quot;Conolly&quot; boarded the &quot;Al Loloa&quot; and found the fire out of control. Before returning to &quot;Conolly&quot;, the survey team found the missing crewmember unharmed.

As part of a reorganization announced in July 1995 of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s surface combatant ships into six core battle groups, nine destroyer squadrons and a new Western Hemisphere Group, &quot;Conolly&quot;&#x27;s homeport was changed from Norfolk, Virginia, to Mayport, Florida, with the shift to occur in 1996–1997.

&quot;Conolly&quot; deployed with the carrier battle group, on 26 January 1996 for a regularly scheduled deployment. The previous December, the battle group and ARG participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 96-1, their &quot;final examination&quot; before deployment, and the culmination of a year of intense preparation.

While deployed, &quot;Conolly&quot; took part in the Ships Anti-Submarine Warfare Readiness Effectiveness Measuring 114 (SHAREM) Invitational Exercise 1-96 (INVITEX), held 23 – 29 February. SHAREM 114 was a U.S. 6th Fleet naval exercise conducted in the Gulf of Valencia off the east coast of Spain.

Following the completion of Operation Destined Glory 96, a NATO amphibious exercise, &quot;Conolly&quot; paid a visit to Augusta Bay, Sicily. Operation Destined Glory 96, lasted 16 days and was a NATO forces combined amphibious exercise which began 13 March and continued through 26 March. It tested forces in the air and at sea in the Central Mediterranean near Sardinia and in the Tyrrhenian Sea and also trained ashore at Capo Teulada, Sardinia. Military units from the NATO countries of Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and United States took part in the exercise which focused on undersea, surface, electronic and air warfare, and included communications and shiphandling skills.

On 11 April, &quot;Conolly&quot; was tasked with escorting , and to Liberia from the Adriatic Sea in support of JTF Assured Response. &quot;Guam&quot;, &quot;Trenton&quot;, &quot;Portland&quot; and &quot;Conolly&quot; were conducting routine training when they were directed to the coastal waters off Liberia.

&quot;Conolly&quot; also assisted in search and rescue efforts when the airplane carrying United States Commerce Department Secretary Ron Brown crashed. It participated in Operation Sharp Guard, enforcing United Nations Security Council resolutions in the former republics of Yugoslavia. While on station, &quot;Conolly&quot; queried 121 merchant vessels, ensuring no contraband cargo entered the troubled region.
In June 1996, &quot;Conolly&quot; took part in Exercise TAPON 96, an allied exercise held in the Alboran Sea, Gulf of Cadiz and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. &quot;Conolly&quot; conducted combined warfare exercises with the Spanish aircraft carrier &quot;Principe de Asturias&quot;, and other surface ships including the Spanish frigates &quot;Baleares&quot;, &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, &quot;Numancia&quot;, the Greek destroyer &quot;Formion&quot;, the Spanish submarine &quot;Delfín&quot; and the US submarine . &quot;Conolly&quot; participated in the nine-day exercise which emphasized procedures and tactics for effective maritime choke-point control. &quot;Conolly&quot; also completed live-firing exercises in the Central Mediterranean Sea at Avgo Nisi gun-firing range, a small island north of Crete, Greece. She then traveled toward Sicily and conducted a torpedo-firing exercise.

In March 1997, &quot;Conolly&quot; moved its homeport from Norfolk, Virginia to Mayport, Florida.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Conolly&quot; was decommissioned 18 September 1998 and laid up at Philadelphia Naval Intermediate Ship Maintenance Facility. An effort to preserve her in Illinois failed after it was unable to acquire the needed funds. &quot;Conolly&quot; was sunk as a target off Florida on 29 April 2009 as part of UNITAS Gold, a multinational naval exercise.

<doc id="553564" wikidata="Q61786" url="?curid=553564" title="Prince Albert of Prussia (1837–1906)">
<text>Prince Albert of Prussia (; 8 May 1837 – 13 September 1906) was a Prussian general field marshal, &quot;Herrenmeister&quot; (Grand Master) of the Order of Saint John from 1883 until his death, and regent of the Duchy of Brunswick from 1885, also until his death.
==Biography==
Albert was born in Berlin on 8 May 1837, the son of Prince Albert of Prussia and Princess Marianne, daughter of King William I of the Netherlands. His father was the brother of King Frederick William IV of Prussia and William I, German Emperor.

Albrecht entered the Prussian army in 1847, serving in the First Schleswig War and participating in the battles of Skalitz, Schweinschädel and Königgrätz in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. In the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he commanded a guard cavalry brigade at Gravelotte and Sedan. After the fall of the Second Empire, he was subordinated to Edwin von Manteuffel in the fighting around Bapaume and St. Quentin. In 1874, he became commander of the X Corps stationed in Hannover. In 1883, he succeeded his uncle Prince Charles as &quot;Herrenmeister&quot; of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).
In 1885, Albert was chosen as Regent for the Duchy of Brunswick, as German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had removed Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, from office. In 1913, Ernst August&#x27;s son, Ernest Augustus, became Duke of Brunswick who only reigned for 5 years and 6 days. After accepting the regency, Albert and Marie resided chiefly in Brunswick, Berlin, and Kamenz.

Prince Albrecht died at Schloss Kamenz on 13 September 1906. He was buried in the Mausoleum auf dem Hutberge in the park of Schloss Kamenz. After World War II, the mausoleum was plundered and the bodies of Albert and his wife were reburied in the park.

===Marriage and issue===
Albert&#x27;s parents had been unhappily married to each other and were later divorced. The unhappiness of that marriage had been a formative influence on Albert during his growing years. His decision to wait until he was 36 before marrying is thought to have been a reflection of his parents&#x27; marital situation.

On 9 April 1873 in Berlin, he married Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. They had three sons:
*Prince Friedrich Heinrich Albrecht (15 April 1874 – 13 November 1940)
*Prince Joachim Albrecht (27 September 1876 – 24 October 1939); married firstly Baroness Marie of Liebenberg (née Blich-Sulzer) (1872-1919) and Karoline Kornelia Stockhammer (1891-1952)
*Prince Friedrich Wilhelm (12 July 1880 – 9 March 1925); married Princess Agatha of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst

<doc id="553565" wikidata="Q2360231" url="?curid=553565" title="Riku (Kingdom Hearts)">
<text>is a fictional character in the Square Enix video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Debuting in the original &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Riku is introduced as a teenager who wishes to visit other worlds with his friends Sora and Kairi. After their home world of Destiny Islands is destroyed, Riku meets Maleficent, whose manipulation causes him to oppose Sora and fall into darkness, being possessed by Ansem, Seeker of Darkness. However, he is freed thanks to Sora and returns as a protagonist in subsequent games.

Riku was created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura, who wanted him to be a foil for Sora&#x27;s character and his character arc to represent the series&#x27; main theme of being able to choose between light or darkness, with his design and story paralleling Terra. He is voiced by Mamoru Miyano and Eiji Shima in Japanese and David Gallagher and Ty Panitz in English.

Critical response to Riku has been widely acclaimed, particularly for his redemption arc and David Gallagher&#x27;s performance.

==Creation and design==

&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; creator Tetsuya Nomura has stated that Riku&#x27;s name can be interpreted as &quot;land&quot;, since the on&#x27;yomi pronunciation of the Japanese word for &quot;land&quot; is , similar to how Sora&#x27;s name is identical to the Japanese word for &quot;sky&quot;, . Along with Sora, Riku&#x27;s character represents one of the series&#x27; main themes, &quot;the light and the dark sides of hearts&quot;.

In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Riku&#x27;s Keyblade is Way to the Dawn, which Nomura designed to resemble his previous weapon, the Soul Eater. Its name is derived from a scene at the end of &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;, where Riku said that he would walk &quot;the road to dawn.&quot; Though Riku has a minor role in &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, Nomura wanted to expand on his connection with Terra, who gave him the ability to wield the Keyblade and would later reunite with him.

On the character&#x27;s role in &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot;, Nomura emphasized Riku as the game&#x27;s main focus, as, despite it featuring Sora and Riku as dual protagonists, it showcases his growth across the series. As a result of the game&#x27;s plot, Sora and Riku appear in their younger forms from the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game. To avoid misconceptions that &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot; was a remake of the original game, Nomura decided to change their outfits for most of the game. For Riku&#x27;s new design, Nomura altered his hair based on fan response following &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.

For &quot;Kingdom Hearts III,&quot; Riku and Kairi&#x27;s new designs were made to fit with Sora&#x27;s; while Kairi&#x27;s main colour remains pink, Riku&#x27;s main colour is blue in contrast to Sora&#x27;s red, with their outfits sharing a gingham pattern due to being given to them by Yen Sid. Riku&#x27;s new Keyblade, Braveheart, was meant to contrast with the Way to Dawn Keyblade.

==Appearances==
Riku is a childhood friend and rival of Sora, who lives with him and Kairi on Destiny Islands. In the original game, where he is fifteen years old, when the Heartless invade Destiny Islands, Riku immerses himself in darkness to discover new worlds beyond his home. Upon arriving at Hollow Bastion, Riku is manipulated by Maleficent into aiding in her plans for world conquest in exchange for knowledge to restore Kairi&#x27;s missing heart. He comes to wield the Soul Eater, a manifestation of the darkness in his heart, and is later revealed to be the rightful owner of Sora&#x27;s Keyblade, which Terra bequeathed to him during the events of &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, when he was five years old; however, his reliance on the power of darkness caused the Keyblade to reject him in favor of Sora. He is later tricked into allowing Xehanort&#x27;s Heartless, Ansem, to possess his body. Following Ansem&#x27;s defeat, Riku sacrifices himself to help Mickey close the door to Kingdom Hearts, stranding them on the other side.

In &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;, DiZ helps Riku escape from the dark realm. Initially rejecting his darkness out of guilt, Riku resolves to wield both powers of light and darkness to battle Ansem, whose essence lingers in his heart. A replica of Riku, known as Riku Replica, appears in &quot;Chain of Memories&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, having been created by Vexen as a pawn.

In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Riku acquires a new Keyblade, the Way to the Dawn. He is forced to harness Ansem&#x27;s power to defeat Roxas and restore Sora&#x27;s missing memories. As a result, he assumes Ansem&#x27;s appearance, returning to normal after DiZ&#x27;s heart encoder explodes. He and Sora return to Destiny Islands together following Xemnas&#x27;s defeat.

Riku appears in the multiplayer mode of &quot;358/2 Days&quot; and in its story mode, where he contacts Xion and is the final boss, facing Roxas as seen in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. In &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot;, he and Sora undertake the Mark of Mastery exam in preparation for Xehanort&#x27;s return. Riku is promoted to Keyblade Master after venturing into Sora&#x27;s dreams as a Dream Eater to protect Sora from Xehanort, who attempts to use him as a vessel.

In &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, he and Mickey venture into the realm of darkness to rescue Aqua, with him being playable in several moments throughout the realm. He is also playable in the &quot;Re Mind&quot; expansion, where he obtains a new Keyblade, Braveheart. While visiting Radiant Garden, Riku analyzes digital copies of Sora and the Organization&#x27;s members in hopes of uncovering clues to Sora&#x27;s whereabouts. After the analysis proves inconclusive, Riku is approached by the Fairy Godmother and taken to meet Yen Sid, who suspects that they may find Sora through the dreams of him and two others. In &quot;Melody of Memory,&quot; Riku explains his dream of a modern metropolis to a girl known as the Nameless Star. She recognizes it as the city of Quadratum in her world and opens a portal for Riku to enter Quadratum and begin his search for Sora.

Riku also makes an appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a spirit. In a collaboration between Square Enix and Japanese fashion brand SuperGroupies, Riku&#x27;s image was used to create clothing based on his design from &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. A perfume based on the character was also released.

==Reception==
USGamer praised Riku&#x27;s role for giving the narrative a major impact as he takes over the role of the Disney villains in Hollow Bastion, defeating the Beast and taking the Keyblade from Sora. Though he is defeated, the reveal that he was being used by Ansem was noted as giving the narrative a darker tone. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; stated that a vital part in Riku&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; is that he embraces darkness, similar to Terra during &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;. The inclusion of Riku in &quot;Chain of Memories&quot; as a playable character was praised by GamesRadar due to his enjoyable gameplay. Comic Book Resources listed Sora and Riku&#x27;s fight against Xemnas as one of Riku&#x27;s best action sequences in the series. Although Riku and Sora are friends, GamesRadar stated that the several cutscenes they share in the first three games of the series often resulted in fans shipping them while ignoring Sora and Kairi&#x27;s relationship. Additionally, Riku has LGBT fans who interpret him through a queer lens due to parallels seen in his journey with self acceptance and real life experiences of accepting one&#x27;s sexual identity. 

Riku&#x27;s quest to be free and the sacrifices he makes in the first game to save Sora were commented on by William Humberto Huber from UC San Diego as symbolizing he and Sora&#x27;s loss of innocence. The arrival of Heartless in Destiny Islands being caused by Riku&#x27;s darkness was seen as an &quot;allusion to the arrival&quot; of Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s ships in Tokyo Bay in 1853, which had a major impact on Japan. In &quot;The Kingdom&#x27;s Shōnen Heart Transcultural Character Design and the JRPG&quot;, Rachael Hutchinson noted that the early characterization of Riku and Sora seems to be influenced by that of Sephiroth and Cloud Strife, respectively, in order to portray their rivalry, with Ansem taking elements from Sephiroth&#x27;s appearance. Riku and Sora being forced to oppose each being caused by Kairi&#x27;s weakness was compared to the sense of loss that Cloud suffers in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; following Aerith&#x27;s death. Riku&#x27;s tragic fate was noted to be similar to Tidus&#x27; disappearance in the ending of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, with his return in latter games being compared to that of characters in shōnen manga as he becomes heroic due to friendship and perseverance, common themes in such manga. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts: A Search For Identity&quot;, writer Michelle Pina describes Riku as a &quot;bratty&quot; youth who tries to act superior to Sora in early appearances in the first game. However, in later installments, he is described as a teenager who suffers from an identity crisis due to the inner conflict between him and Ansem after he gives up himself to the darkness within him.

In the book &quot;Kingdom Hearts II (Boss Fight Books Book 16)&quot;, Alexa Ray Corriea argues that Terra saw Riku&#x27;s full potential when giving him the power to wield the Keyblade, claiming that, while Riku was a child when they first met, Terra saw through Riku&#x27;s original intention of wanting to protect others, which may come across as a retcon when contrasting with previous installments. Riku&#x27;s new Keyblade, Braveheart, was commented on by Syfy as being one of the most interesting Keyblade designs in the game, citing parallels with the Keyblade Fenrir in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.

In regards to Riku&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, &quot;TheGamer&quot; believed the English translation was not completely faithful to portrayal of the original Riku&#x27;s feelings he has been expressing previous games; When Terra asks the infant Riku why does he want before giving him the ability to wield the Keyblade, the child replies by that he wants to learn what he wants to protect. In &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot;, Riku gains this answer when saving a comatose Sora by solving Ansem&#x27;s questions, knowing the power he wants is the one used to protect Sora. This theme is explored in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; in early cutscenes where Hercules tells Sora that the reason he became strong is due to finding the love he wanted. Similarly, when Riku and Mickey enter the Realm of Darkness, the latter remarks that former became stronger in this world since the last time he was. When Riku reflects on this comment, he recalls his answer from &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot;. While the writer does not claim that Riku loves Sora in a romantic fashion, he still views him as one of the most important things he wants to protect and the Japanese version was more direct and appears to reference Hercules&#x27; newfound strength.

Hardcore Gamer liked the inclusion of Riku as a playable character in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; DLC, but lamented his few possible fights. The character&#x27;s inclusion in the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building during the &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; secret ending was the subject of analysis as to whether he could interact with the cast from &quot;The World Ends With You&quot; as well as Yozora. With the end of &quot;Re Mind&quot;, &quot;GameInformer&quot; said that Riku came across as a more developed character than Sora, despite Sora being the protagonist.

The performance of David Gallagher as Riku, along with Haley Joel Osment as Sora and Willa Holland as Aqua, was praised by GamesRadar and Hardcore Gamer as one of the best performances in &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. His inclusion as a playable character in &quot;3D&quot; was also praised due to his dynamic with Sora. Koinya lamented the fact that Mamoru Miyano&#x27;s work was never made available for a Western audience, considering him talented alongside Miyu Irino as Sora. In a poll from &quot;Famitsu&quot;, Riku was voted as the series&#x27; fourth best male character.

<text>USS &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; (DD-980) was a built for the United States Navy by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Affectionately nicknamed the &quot;Moose&quot; by her crews, she was named in honor of Vice Admiral Frederick Moosbrugger who is best known for his service in World War II as a highly successful commander of destroyer squadrons.

== History ==
USS &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; was laid down 3 November 1975, launched 23 July 1977 and commissioned 16 December 1978. She arrived at her new home port at Charleston, South Carolina just prior to Christmas 1978 becoming the first of her class at that base. She conducted shakedown operations at Fleet Training Center, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands during this time.

Following shakedown, USS &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; returned to her builders for post-commissioning refits and upgrades. While at Pascagoula, she was ordered to conduct an emergency sortie in order to avoid the worst effects of Hurricane Frederic, spending several days in the Gulf of Mexico while the storm system passed. Following her return to port, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; supplied electrical power to portions of the shipyard to allow her refit to complete. It was in this refit that a pair of moose antlers were installed on the ship, just below the bridge windows.

&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea on 14 July 1980, acting as flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadron 20 for the entire deployment. She conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and amphibious support operations during the deployment. Port visits included Rota, Spain, Naples, Italy, Cagliari, Italy, La Spezia, Italy, Marseilles, France, Benidorm, Spain, Cartagena, Spain, and Palma de Mallorca. She returned from this deployment on 11 December 1980. She was the test platform for the AN/SQR 19(V) tactical towed array sonar (TACTAS) in 1982.

&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; received the Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for service as set forth in the following citation:
In 1989, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; made the final Cold War deployment to the United States Sixth Fleet as the primary ASW element of the USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; Battle Group.
===1990s===
In August 1990, USS &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; was part of the initial United States response to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. She deployed on six days notice for Operation Desert Shield to join the rapidly formed USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Battle Group. She deployed from Charleston, South Carolina and joined &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; en route to the Red Sea &quot;via&quot; the Mediterranean Sixth Fleet. In the months of coalition build-up prior to the beginning of hostilities, the &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; performed several important tasks. She was first tasked to delay her Suez transit by several weeks in order to be the US contribution to the standing up of NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force Mediterranean making port calls in Italy and Balearic Islands. Completing her short stay with NATO, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; transited the Suez in early September to rejoin Kennedy and immediately took a station in the North Red Sea entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba tasked with visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) to support enforcement of UN Iraq Sanctions. In September and early October she stopped and boarded nearly 30 merchant ships bound for Jordan. Following a short maintenance period in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, she took onboard small contingents of U.S. Coast Guard personnel and Navy SEALS, both trained in VBSS and continued search and seizure operations until transiting back North through the Suez. &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; spent Christmas 1990 in Haifa, Israel, departing the following day back to the Suez Canal and Red Sea.

When Operation Desert Storm began in January 1991, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; was again assigned maritime interdiction patrol at the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. Her assignment was to stop, board, and search merchant vessels flagged by nations sympathetic to Iraq; and to prevent any war materials found onboard from reaching Jordan and ultimately Iraq. When hostilities ceased, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; made ports-of-call in Egypt, Crete, and Gibraltar before crossing the Atlantic for the United States. &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for service during the Persian Gulf War.

&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; performed an extensive update in Charleston shipyard which removed its forward anti-submarine missile launcher of the ASROC family and upgraded to the RUM-139 VL-ASROC vertical launching system (VLS). This allowed the ship the ability to fire Tomahawk missiles in addition to vertically launched ASROC.

&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; relocated to Mayport, Florida, on 11 March 1995, from its previous home port of Charleston, South Carolina. The &quot;Spruance&quot;-class ship was the sixth of eleven ships scheduled for relocation to Mayport as a result of the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision.

&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; went into drydock to install women&#x27;s living quarters and restrooms. She was one of the first surface warships to have women on it.

The yard period in Mayport Florida was also to repair extensive issues encountered during the overhaul and upgrades performed at the Earl Shipyard in Charleston just a few years prior to.

Following these extensive overhaul periods, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; deployed in 1996, along with , and , to take part in UNITAS 96, a series of combined tactical at-sea operations, amphibious operations and in-port exercises with participating South American naval forces. During that deployment, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; spent almost two weeks in Venezuelan waters conducting anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare and anti-air gunnery exercises in the Caribbean Sea. She then departed for Brazil for the next phase of UNITAS.

&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; deployed in 1998, along with &quot;La Moure County&quot;, and , to take part in UNITAS 39–98, serving as the USCOMSOLANT flagship with COMDESRON 32 as the Operational Commander. UNITAS, Latin for unity, consists of at-sea operations, amphibious operations, riverine operations and in port exercises conducted with nine South American navies over a four-month period. The U.S. task group circumnavigated South America in a clockwise direction, returning to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in November. The 40-year-old operation promotes a cooperative maritime strategy in the region while supporting the U.S. policy of continued engagement in South America through forward presence. The navies of Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and South Africa joined the United States and South American navies for the first phase of UNITAS. This phase was led by the United States and conducted in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s longest-running annual deployment began at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, as seven ships from four foreign navies joined a five ship U.S. task group.

While in Puerto Rico, on 20 April 1998, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; took part in Independent Deployer Exercise (INDEX) 98-2, off the coast of Puerto Rico. During the exercise, &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; fired two Sea Sparrows from her deck at guided target drones launched from the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads. The exercise also included target drones fired from A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. Following this, the task force then headed for Venezuela on 18 July as Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia each directed, in turn, their own phase of UNITAS. Overall, U.S. forces worked with host navies from Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. The specific exercises conducted in each phase are determined by the host navy, making each phase unique. Exercises included all areas of modern naval warfare including anti-air, amphibious, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare.

===Fate===
&quot;Moosbrugger&quot; was placed in commission, in reserve on 16 October 2000 at Mayport, Florida to prepare for decommissioning. On 15 December 2000, she was decommissioned and subsequently brought to Philadelphia Naval Intermediate Ship Maintenance Facility. She was maintained there in Maintenance Category B for activation in time of national emergency until 2006, when she was towed to Brownsville, Texas, for dismantling.

== Ship&#x27;s crest ==
The official crest of USS &quot;Moosbrugger&quot; symbolizes the dedication and courage displayed by her namesake, Vice Admiral Frederick Moosbrugger, during World War II.

The trident, an attribute of Neptune, god of the seas, represents the awesome strength and dominance of the modern destroyer. It also resembles the letter &quot;M,&quot; an allusion to the initial letter of &quot;Moosbrugger&quot;, the ship&#x27;s namesake. The ship&#x27;s motto is &quot;More than Required&quot;.

Through the heraldic fountain for water, the grappling iron (a device used for close range, early naval encounters), and the torpedo, the crest commemorates the Battle of Vella Gulf in the South Pacific during World War II. The then-Commander Moosbrugger led his ships into exceedingly close range against Japanese naval forces; took the enemy by surprise, and delivered a devastating torpedo attack, thereby annihilating the hostile force. For this action, he was awarded the Navy Cross. The gold laurel wreath is symbolic of Vice Admiral Frederick Moosbrugger&#x27;s long and distinguished career.

<text>H1 was a particle detector operated at the HERA (&quot;Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage&quot;) collider at the German national laboratory DESY in Hamburg. The first studies for the H1 experiment were proposed in 1981. The H1 detector began operating together with HERA in 1992 and took data until 2007. It consisted of several different detector components, measured about 12 m × 15 m × 10 m and weighed 2800 tons. It was one of four detectors along the HERA accelerator.

The main physics goals of the H1 experiment were the investigation of the internal structure of the proton through measurements of deep inelastic scattering, the measurements of further cross sections to study fundamental interactions between particles in order to test the Standard Model of particle physics, as well as the search for new kinds of matter and unexpected phenomena in particle physics. Scientists continue to publish scientific papers based on data taken by the H1 experiment until today, and the detailed knowledge of the proton gained through experiments like H1 laid the foundation to much of the science done at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN particle physics laboratory today.

The name H1 is used for both the detector itself and the collaboration of physicists and technicians who operated the experiment.

== History ==
The construction of a lepton–proton collider was recommended strongly by the European Committee for Future Accelerators (ECFA) on May 9, 1980. The first proposals for the H1 detector were made in 1981, and the letter of intent for the H1 experiment was published on June 28, 1985. The technical proposal for the H1 detector was finalized on March 25, 1986.

The H1 detector was operational with the first collisions of HERA in 1992. It was upgraded during the HERA luminosity upgrade for the HERA II running period from 2000 to 2003. The H1 detector then took data until the shutdown of HERA in June 2007 and was mostly dismantled afterwards.

Several subdetector components are now exhibited in the HERA Hall West at DESY. The HERA North Hall, where the H1 detector was located, is now used for the new ALPS experiment, which looks for axion-like particles.

The data taken with the H1 detector are preserved for future analyses within the DPHEP (Data Preservation and Long Term Analysis in High Energy Physics) initiative.

The &quot;sister experiment&quot; of H1 at the HERA accelerator was the ZEUS experiment, which was also a multi-purpose detector with similar physics goals to H1.

== The H1 collaboration ==
The H1 experiment was designed and operated by an international collaboration of about 400 physicists and technicians from 43 institutes in 18 countries (List of currently participating institutes).

== The H1 detector ==
Leptons (electrons or positrons) collided with protons in the interaction point of H1, and the particles produced in these collisions were detected by the H1 detector components. The collision products, often including the proton remnant and the scattered lepton, were detected by several subdetectors. Combining their information allowed the identification of particles from the interaction, or at least the reconstruction of the overall reaction kinematics. This in turn allowed the classification of the reaction. From the center outwards, H1&#x27;s most important systems were:
* Silicon trackers for the determination of primary and secondary vertices
* Jet chambers for the measurement of charged particle tracks
* Liquid argon (LAr) calorimeter for the measurement of electromagnetic and hadronic showers
* Lead/scintillating fibre calorimeter (SpaCal) in the backward direction for the measurement of the scattered lepton
* Superconducting solenoidal magnet to bend the charged particles&#x27; trajectories
* Muon detectors in the iron magnet yoke surrounding H1 and in the forward direction.
In addition to these systems, H1 had several helper systems, such as a luminosity system, time of flight (ToF) detectors and radiation monitors. Other detector systems were added as the focus on special physics processes was extended, for example, forward instrumentation for diffractive physics far down the HERA tunnel.

While H1 was a general-purpose detector, its main design feature was an asymmetric construction to cope with the boosted center of mass in the laboratory frame due to the large energy imbalance of the colliding beams. In the forward (incident proton) direction, the instrumentation had higher granularity to give a better resolution for refined measurements of the proton remnant left after the collision with the incident lepton. In the backward direction, into which the lepton was mostly scattered, the detectors were optimized for the reconstruction of the scattered lepton trajectory.

== Physics addressed by H1 ==
The most interesting physics topics treated at H1 include
* Cross section measurements of reactions with charged and neutral electroweak currents
* Studies of proton structure and determination of quark and gluon parton distribution functions
* Tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in jet and particle production
* Production of heavy quarks (charm and bottom)
* Tests of electroweak theory
* Diffraction (physics with the exchange of a pomeron)
* Search for physics beyond the Standard Model (for example, the substructure of quarks / contact interactions, leptoquarks, magnetic monopoles)

<doc id="553575" wikidata="Q1761763" url="?curid=553575" title="USS Leftwich">
<text>USS &quot;Leftwich&quot; (DD-984) was a &quot;Spruance-class destroyer&quot; built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was named for Lieutenant Colonel William G. Leftwich, Jr., USMC (1931–1970), commander of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion who was killed in action during Operation Imperial Lake in Quảng Nam Province South Vietnam on 18 November 1970 in a helicopter crash during the extraction of one of his reconnaissance teams. For this action, Lieutenant Colonel Leftwich received the Silver Star. Lieutenant Colonel Leftwich&#x27;s medals and awards include: the Navy Cross, the Silver Star (posthumous), the Legion of Merit with Combat &quot;V&quot; and two gold stars, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal with one gold star, the Purple Heart with two gold stars, and various personal awards from the Republic of Vietnam.

&quot;Leftwich&quot; was laid down on 12 November 1976; and launched 8 April 1978; and commissioned 25 August 1979. The Commissioning speaker was the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Thomas B. Hayward, USN, who was a classmate of Bill Leftwich at the United States Naval Academy. Also in attendance at the Commissioning was H. Ross Perot, also a classmate of Lieutenant Colonel Leftwich. Both of Colonel Leftwich&#x27;s sons and his widow attended the commissioning as well.

== 1979–1985 ==
&quot;Leftwich&quot; sailed from Pascagoula, MS the morning following the commissioning on 26 August 1979, en route via the Panama Canal for her homeport, Naval Station San Diego, from which she operated until March 1985.

On sailing, Hurricane David was threatening to make its way into the Gulf of Mexico, so shipping traffic on the transit to the Panama Canal was unusually light. Hurricane David did strike the Gulf coast, and was followed shortly after by Hurricane Frederic, which caused many ships at Ingalls Shipbuilding and Drydock to sortie into the hurricane.

The &quot;Leftwich&quot; made one of the fastest transits on record of the Panama Canal, making the passage without having to anchor. On sailing north in the Pacific Ocean, &quot;Leftwich&quot; found herself behind Hurricane Guillermo, which tracked along the western coast of Mexico, and then turned westward out into the Pacific, allowing the ship to arrive at her new homeport on schedule. While following the storm, &quot;Leftwich&quot; experienced waves.

In the few months after arrival in San Diego, CA, &quot;Leftwich&quot; conducted &quot;Shakedown&quot; training under the guidance of Fleet Training Group, Pacific, in the San Diego Operations Area (OPAREA). In January 1980, &quot;Leftwich&quot; returned to Litton Industries at Pascagoula, MS for Warranty repairs and a Post-Shakedown Availability, which included the installation of the NATO Sea Sparrow and Harpoon missile system.

On 29 November 1982 she collided with the submarine USS &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; (SSBN-610) approximately east of Subic Bay, Philippines. Both ships were conducting war games. &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; was at periscope depth when the collision occurred. Both ships suffered damage and returned to Subic Bay. &quot;Edison&quot; suffered damage to her sail, sail planes, and sonar dome. &quot;Leftwich&quot; suffered damage to her sonar dome, sonar dome &quot;banjo&quot; strut, and forward fuel storage tanks located in the forward hull. Two months later, &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; made a surface transit to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for decommissioning without the damage having been repaired.

In 1984, &quot;Leftwich&quot; suffered hull and sonar window damage due to high-speed operations in heavy seas during fleet exercises on her deployment to Indian Ocean/Western Pacific (WESTPAC 1984).

== 1985–1998 ==
On 1 April 1985 &quot;Leftwich&quot; arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This remained her homeport for the rest of her career.

Leftwich, under the command of RADM (then Commander) Daniel Bowler, participated in Operation Nimble Archer on 19 October 1987. This was a response to Iran&#x27;s 16 October 1987 attack on the MV Sea Isle City, a reflagged Kuwaiti oil tanker at anchor off Kuwait, with a Silkworm missile.

&quot;Leftwich&quot; with Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 3 Detachment 5 embarked, arrived at Naval Station Pearl Harbor homeport. In 1990–91, under the command of Commander Patrick Garrett in support of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the destroyer conducted more than 200 merchant ship interceptions and one boarding. She was one of the first ships to fire BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the conflict, and was the first combatant to conduct a wartime reload of Tomahawks for continued operations. With embarked helicopters and SEALs, she captured the first Iraqi territory repatriated in the war (an island off the coast of the al-Faw waterway), multiple enemy prisoners of war, and conducted 16 combat search and rescue cases. For her efforts in the Persian Gulf, The Leftwich and her crew were awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon and the Combat Action Ribbon.

During her career, &quot;Leftwich&quot; made eight deployments in the Western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. She participated in Operation Nimble Archer, Desert Shield, and Desert Storm as well as operations in support of UN sanctions against Iraq.

&quot;Leftwich&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 March 1998. She was sunk as a target on 1 August 2003 at in the Pacific Ocean.

Awards, Medals, and Commendations for ship and/or crew: (needs more help) Sept 87 – Nov 87, Jan 97 – Mar 97, Apr 97 Three Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, Jan 91 – Feb 91 Combat Action Ribbon, Jan 91 – Feb 91 Navy Unit Commendation, Jul 81- Sept 81 Navy Expeditionary Medal, Jan 88 – Jun 89 &amp; Jan 91 – Dec 92 Two Battle Effectiveness Awards, National Defense Service Medal, Dec 90 – Mar 91 Southwest Asia Service Medal, 8 Sea Service Ribbons, Dec 97 – Dec 98 Chief of Naval Operations Letter of Commendation, Kuwait Liberation Medal, Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) 1990? Coast Guard Special Operations Ribbon (drug interdiction ops, relieved the Ingersoll)

<text>USS &quot;Cushing&quot; (DD-985), named after Commander William Barker Cushing, was the fifth ship of the United States Navy to bear the name. &quot;Cushing&quot; was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. &quot;Cushing&quot; operated out of Yokosuka, Japan for the last several years of her career. &quot;Cushing&quot; was the last &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer to remain in active service, until decommissioned on 21 September 2005.

==History==
&quot;Cushing&quot; was laid down 27 December 1976 by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 17 June 1978 and commissioned on 21 September 1979. &quot;Cushing&quot; was the last U.S. warship to transit the Panama Canal prior to control of the canal being handed over to Panama in 1979.

Prior to its formal commissioning, &quot;Cushing&quot; departed her builders in Mississippi in order to avoid the oncoming Hurricane Frederic. She remained in the Gulf of Mexico with a crew of U.S. Navy sailors and ship builder personnel. After the passage of the storm, she returned to her builders yard for final outfitting and was quickly commissioned with her crew in dungarees in the helo hangar and deck prior to departure for her first homeport of San Diego, California where she was formally commissioned on 21 September 1979 in its home port.

During the mid-to-late 1980s &quot;Cushing&quot; was a member of the Pacific Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Squadron--Destroyer Squadron 31. She was specially modified to support the DESRON staff operations and served as the primary flagship. She was also one of the few of the class that carried the AN/SQR-15 Towed Array Sonar System.

In the early 1990s &quot;Cushing&quot; served to demonstrate the effectiveness of rudder roll stabilization (RRS). Engineers from the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center installed the developmental RRS system and monitored its operations. The successful demonstration led to RRS being implemented in Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyers. While home ported in Pearl Harbor HI, Cushing conducted cruises in the North Pacific in 1991 and 1992 with visits to the west coast and Canada. In 1992 Cushing deployed to Central and South America as the flagship for UNITAS 33, 92. Cushing passed through the Panama Canal from Pacific to Atlantic side in 1992 embarked the Admiral at Puerto Rico. Cushing circumnavigated South America and passed through the Panama Canal again from the Pacific to the Atlantic side in less than 6 months. After disembarking the Admiral in Puerto Rico the Cushing passed through the Panama Canal again on her return voyage to San Diego then home port Pearl Harbor HI in late 1992. 1993 was spent conducting short cruises at sea around HI and in 1994 Cushing entered dry dock at Pearl Harbor for, among other things, the addition of the VLS (vertical launch system) missile package.

As part of a 1995 reorganization of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, with the reorganization scheduled to be completed by 1 October, and homeport changes to be completed within the following year, &quot;Cushing&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 5.

A prototype Remote Minehunting System (RMS) was installed onboard &quot;Cushing&quot; in time for the Fall 1996 deployment to provide the battle group with a mine reconnaissance capability. This was an upgrade of the system successfully used in 1995 with the additional capability for shipboard launch and recovery and direct interface to the shipboard system. In fiscal year 1997, the RMS concept was successfully demonstrated by employment of a prototype system from &quot;Cushing&quot; during a Persian Gulf exercise.

In early 1997, &quot;Cushing&quot; was conducting Maritime Interception Operations in the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Cushing&quot; departed Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 16 March 1998, for its new home port of Yokosuka, Japan. The destroyer had been homeported in Pearl Harbor since 1991 and was set to replace which was changing homeports to Everett, Washington. During her time in Pearl Harbor, &quot;Cushing&quot; made four Western Pacific deployments and one to the South Atlantic. Upon arrival in Japan, &quot;Cushing&quot; was assigned to Commander, Destroyer Squadron 15, and deployed in May to participate in CARAT &#x27;98, a multi-national exercise with navies of Southeast Asian nations. CARAT &#x27;98 was the fourth annual Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise held between the United States and six Southeast Asia countries from 12 May to 5 August 1998. As part of a series of bilateral training exercises, CARAT 98 had U.S. forces training with military forces of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. CARAT &#x27;98 demonstrated U.S. commitment to security and stability in Southeast Asia while increasing the operational readiness and capabilities of U.S. forces. The exercise also promoted interoperability and cooperation with U.S. regional friends and allies by offering a broad spectrum of mutually beneficial training opportunities.

From 22 to 25 March 1999 &quot;Cushing&quot; operated along with Battle Force 7th Fleet and took part in a multi-national live-fire missile exercise (MTX 99) in waters near the Marianas Islands. Also involved in the MTX 99 were naval units from Australia, Canada, Singapore, and South Korea. Fired during MTX 99 were live weapons which included Harpoon, Penguin and Maverick missiles, torpedoes and various shipboard weapons systems. The former was used as the target vessel.

&quot;Cushing&quot; took part in the 38th Foal Eagle exercise held in the fall of 1999. A regularly scheduled exercise, Foal Eagle combined forces from South Korea and the United States. In August 2000, &quot;Cushing&quot; took part in SHAREM 138. &quot;Cushing&quot; and various units in the Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF), participated in SHAREM (Ship ASW Readiness Effectiveness Measuring) 138 along with units from the host, Japan Maritime Self Defense Force near Okinawa, Japan. Although weather conditions curtailed SHAREM events, valuable training was accomplished in the art of Undersea Warfare (USW).

&quot;Cushing&quot; took part in Missile Exercise (MISSILEX) 01-1 which was held 17 to 18 November 2000 as part of a coordinated task group operation.
During a Naval Surface Fire Support exercise held near Guam on 4–5 December 2000, the Cushing posted a better-than-perfect score during a gun shoot. The exercise was designed to test the accuracy and effectiveness of &quot;Cushing&quot;&#x27;s guns and the proficiency of its watch teams. When the grade sheets were tallied, with bonus points for superior communications performance, &quot;Cushing&quot; was awarded 101.5 points out of 100.

&quot;Cushing&quot; was honored by Commander, Destroyer Squadron 15, when she received the Silver Enlisted Surface Warfare Excellence Pennant on 25 January 2001. As a result, &quot;Cushing&quot; was now authorized to fly the pennant as all enlisted personnel E5 and senior have qualified as enlisted surface warfare specialists within the required time standard set forth by the Chief of Naval Operations. &quot;Cushing&quot; was the first ship of Destroyer Squadron 15 to qualify for this award.
On 5 July 2002, a U.S. Navy Sikorsky UH-3H Sea King, Desert Duck 744, operated by HC-2, Detachment 2, suffered a tail rotor failure while landing aboard &quot;Cushing&quot;. It spun out of control and went over the starboard side. The seven on board got out safely.

On 7 November 2003, &quot;Cushing&quot; began joint exercise Annualex 15G, which included maneuvers with the Japanese Navy.

===Fate===
&quot;Cushing&quot; operated out of Yokosuka, Japan for the last several years of her career. &quot;Cushing&quot; was the last &quot;Spruance&quot;-class ship to remain in active service, until decommissioned and stricken from the Navy list on 21 September 2005. GlobalSecurity.org showed the ship listed for grant transfer to Turkey. Ex-&quot;Cushing&quot; was sunk as a target on 14 July 2008 during RIMPAC 2008 along with , and .

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
&quot;Cushing&quot;″s coat of arms symbolizes the spirit and endeavors of William Barker Cushing, as well as the tradition of destroyers named in honor of this naval officer.

The predominant colors of dark blue and gold are traditionally associated with the Navy and symbolize the sea and excellence. The indented division of the shield represents a log boom and pile and is suggestive of the manner in which Commander Cushing accomplished the sinking of CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;. The upper area of the pile is red, alluding to the danger of this famous action and that Commander Cushing was under enemy fire more than any other Union Navy officer. The lion&#x27;s head is a symbol of courage and strength and signifies the character of Commander Cushing. His spirit is also reflected in the ship&#x27;s motto, &quot;Non Sibi Sed Patriae&quot;, a statement attributed to the ancient Roman Cicero that translates to &quot;Not for Self but for Country&quot;. The trident is a traditional maritime symbol and its sharp points suggest offensive action. The spar torpedo is dark blue alluding to the dark night and the covert nature of the sinking of &quot;Albemarle&quot;. The dark blue also recalls the fact that Commander Cushing took the torpedo, at that time a Confederate weapon, and successfully used it to sink an enemy vessel. The five stars refer to the fact that &quot;Cushing&quot; is the fifth ship in the U.S. Navy to carry the name.

<doc id="553585" wikidata="Q7870034" url="?curid=553585" title="USS Harry W. Hill">
<text>USS &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; (DD-986), named for Admiral Harry W. Hill USN, was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Her commissioning sponsor was Mrs. Mary Helen Hill, the admiral&#x27;s daughter-in-law.

==History==

In late November 1982 &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; was detached from the battle-group to shadow the Soviet aircraft carrier &quot;Minsk&quot;, which was transiting the Indian Ocean for her first deployment to the Far East, a matter of considerable interest to U.S. planners. As such, &quot;Enterprise&quot; assigned two intelligence specialists to &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; to help in tracking the Russians. &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; rejoined the battle-group on 19–20 January 1983.

&quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; deployed as part of operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, part of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. On 14 January 1991, she collided with the Wichita class replenishment oiler while conducting underway replenishment operations in the Gulf of Oman. There were no personnel casualties or injuries reported.

In 1994, &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; was significantly damaged during a maneuver to re-float her and exit a dry dock. In the incident, she was caught by a gust of wind which caused the ship to smash into the dry dock. One of the steel wire control lines intended to control the ship parted, seriously injuring two crewmen in the process. The ship sustained damage to her rudders, screws, and controllable prop pitch systems.

&quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; was the only &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer not to receive the armored box launchers nor the Mark 41 vertical launch system for firing Tomahawk cruise missiles.

===Fate===
She was based at San Diego for much of her career. &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy List on 29 May 1998. She was sunk as a target during RIMPAC 2004 on 15 July 2004.

<doc id="553588" wikidata="Q1992307" url="?curid=553588" title="Madman Muntz">
<text>Earl William &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz (January 3, 1914 – June 21, 1987) was an American businessman and engineer who sold and promoted cars and consumer electronics in the United States from the 1930s until his death in 1987. He was a pioneer in television commercials with his oddball &quot;Madman&quot; persona; an alter ego who generated publicity with his unusual costumes, stunts, and outrageous claims. Muntz also pioneered car stereos by creating the Muntz Stereo-Pak, better known as the 4-track cartridge, a predecessor to the 8-track cartridge developed by Lear Industries.

He invented the practice that came to be known as Muntzing, which involved simplifying otherwise complicated electronic devices. Muntz produced and marketed the first black-and-white television receivers to sell for less than $100, and created one of the earliest functional widescreen projection TVs. He was credited with coining the abbreviation &quot;TV&quot; for &quot;television&quot;, although the term had earlier been in use in call letters for stations such as WCBS-TV. A high school dropout, Muntz made fortunes by selling automobiles, TV receivers, and car stereos and tapes. A 1968 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article noted that in one year he sold $72 million worth of cars; five years later he sold $55 million worth of TV receivers, and in 1967 he sold $30 million worth of car stereos and tapes.

After his success as a used car salesman and with Kaiser-Frazer dealerships in Los Angeles and New York City, Muntz founded the Muntz Car Company, which made the &quot;Muntz Jet&quot;, a sports car with jet-like contours. The car was manufactured between 1951 and 1953, although fewer than 400 were produced.

Muntz married seven times. His wives included actress Joan Barton (who appeared in &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot; with John Wayne) and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens finishing schools. Phyllis Diller was among his many girlfriends. He was friends with celebrities such as singer Rudy Vallee, comedian Jerry Colonna, actor Bert Lahr, television presenter Dick Clark, and cowboy actor Gene Autry.

==Early career: 1922–1953==

Muntz was fascinated by electronics from an early age. He built his first radio at age 8 and built another for his parents&#x27; car at age 14. During the Great Depression, at age 15, he dropped out of Elgin High School to work in his parents&#x27; hardware store in Elgin, Illinois.

===Car sales===
In 1934, Muntz opened his first used car lot, in Elgin, with a $500 ($ in ) line of credit. He was only 20 years old, and his mother had to sign the car-sale papers because legally he was too young to close his own deals. During a vacation in California, Muntz discovered that used cars sold there for far higher prices, so he moved to California in 1940 at age 26 to open a used car lot in Glendale. On a hunch, he purchased 13 brand-new right-hand-drive vehicles to resell. These vehicles had been built for customers in Asia, but could not be delivered due to World War II. One vehicle was a custom-made Lincoln built for Chiang Kai-shek. Local newspapers ran stories about the unusual cars, and Muntz sold them all within two weeks, still in their original shipping crates. Muntz soon opened a second lot in Los Angeles and closed his lot in Elgin.

Muntz rejected the then-common opinion that used car salesmen should project a staid image. He realized the possibilities of generating publicity with odd stunts, and developed a &quot;Madman&quot; persona as a result. His flamboyant billboards and oddball television and radio commercials soon made him famous. In his used auto commercials, he marketed one model as the &quot;daily special&quot;; Muntz claimed that if the car did not sell that day, he would smash it to pieces on camera with a sledgehammer. Another notorious Muntz used-car TV pitch was &quot;I buy &#x27;em retail and sell &#x27;em wholesale ... it&#x27;s more fun that way!&quot; His commercials generated so much publicity that comedians such as Bob Hope, Jack Benny, and Steve Allen often tried to outdo each other during television appearances by telling &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz jokes. University of Southern California fans would spell out Muntz&#x27;s name during halftime as a prank.

During the war, the Office of Price Administration sought to suspend Muntz&#x27; license to sell automobiles subject to price control. On August 1, 1945, Muntz was acquitted of an O.P.A. charge of violating used car regulations by Superior Judge Reuben H. Schmidt in Los Angeles.

Muntz&#x27;s car lots became tourist attractions due to the widespread publicity from his television commercial appearances. A 1946 survey by &quot;Panner Motor Tours&quot; revealed that they ranked seventh among tourist attractions in Southern California. Muntz was willing to take large risks in his attempts to generate publicity. During the era of McCarthyism, he asked one of his advisers, &quot;Do you think I&#x27;d make the front pages if I joined the Communist Party?&quot;

===Muntz Jet===

In 1948, race car designer and Kurtis-Kraft founder Frank Kurtis attempted to market a new sports car, the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport. Only 36 units had been sold by 1950. In 1951, for just $200,000 ($ in ) Kurtis sold the cars&#x27; manufacturing license to Muntz, who quickly rebadged them as the &quot;Muntz Jet&quot;. Initial production of the Jet took place in Glendale, where Muntz extended the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport&#x27;s body by , making it a four-seater, and exchanged the Ford V8 engine for a larger Cadillac V8. Later, after making just 28 Jets in California, Muntz moved production to a new factory in Evanston, Illinois, extended the body further by , and replaced the Cadillac V8 with a less expensive Lincoln sidevalve V8.

The Jet was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of &quot;Popular Science&quot; along with a Jaguar and an MG. It featured its own design, with aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top. Paint schemes were extravagant, with names like &quot;Mars Red&quot;, &quot;Stratosphere Blue&quot;, and &quot;Lime Mist&quot;, and interior options included alligator or Spanish leatherette. The backseat armrests contained a full cocktail bar.

The Jet was capable of a top speed of and acceleration of 0–50 mph (0–80 km/h) in 6 seconds, a significant achievement for a road car at the time. The fastest production car in 1953 was the Pegaso Z-102 Supercharged sports car at . Jet owners included the CEO of CBS Frank Stanton, and actors Mickey Rooney and Lash La Rue.

The labor and materials required to produce the Jet resulted in a high price for the end product and, in 1954, after selling about 400 cars and losing about $1,000 ($ in ) on each, Muntz closed the company. Today, Muntz Jets are prized collector cars and are recognized as predecessors to the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird.

===Muntz TV===
Muntz started plans to sell television receivers in 1946, and sales began in 1947. Muntz played the madman in his unorthodox television commercials, but in fact he was a shrewd businessman and a self-taught electrical engineer. By trial and error, taking apart and studying Philco, RCA, and DuMont televisions, he figured out how to reduce the devices&#x27; electrical components to their minimum functional number. This practice became known as &quot;Muntzing&quot;.

In the 1940s and 1950s, most brands of television receivers were complicated pieces of equipment, commonly containing about 30 vacuum tubes, as well as rheostats, transformers, and other heavy components. As a result, they were usually very expensive: the cheapest U.S.-manufactured receiver made before World War II used a screen and cost $125 ($ in ); the cheapest model with a screen cost $445 ($ in ). By 1954, although broadcast television in the United States had existed in various forms since 1928, only 55 percent of U.S. households owned a receiver. By contrast, eight years later, 90 percent of U.S. households had one.

Muntz developed a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17 tubes. He often carried a pair of wire clippers, and when he thought that one of his employees was &quot;overengineering&quot; a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer &quot;Well, I guess you have to put that last part back in&quot; and walk away.

Marketed under the name &quot;Muntz&quot; by his company Muntz TV, Inc., the simplified units were the first black and white TV receivers to retail in the U.S. for less than $100. Muntz was also the first retailer to measure his screens from corner to corner rather than by width. The receivers sold well and were reliable partly because fewer tubes created less heat. The sets worked well in metropolitan areas that were close to television transmission towers where signals were strong. They worked poorly with weaker signals, as most of the components that Muntz had removed were intended to boost performance in fringe areas. This was a calculated decision: Muntz preferred to leave the low-volume, high-performance television receiver market to firms such as RCA and Zenith Electronics, as his intended customers were primarily urban dwellers with limited funds. Additionally, many urban apartment buildings had rules prohibiting external television antennas, and installation of an antenna, even if allowed, cost as much as $150. Muntz solved this problem by adding a built-in antenna to his receivers. In 1952, Muntz TV Inc. grossed $49.9 million ($ in ).
Muntz continued with his &quot;Madman&quot; persona in many of his advertisements. In one TV commercial that normally aired after &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, Muntz, dressed in red long johns and a Napoleon hat, promoted his new televisions by saying, &quot;I wanna give &#x27;em away, but Mrs. Muntz won&#x27;t let me. She&#x27;s crazy!&quot; Another TV commercial presented a marching-band song with lyrics about Muntz TVs and incorporated animations by Oskar Fischinger. His radio commercials, which Muntz ran up to 170 times a day, initially followed a classical music theme built around the spelling of Muntz&#x27;s name. However, he soon convinced radio stations to run ads more in line with his persona. In one spot, Muntz screamed &quot;Stop staring at your radio!&quot; He followed up his radio ads with a direct mail campaign, collecting thousands of TV knobs and mailing them to prospective customers with a note saying, &quot;Call us and we&#x27;ll show up with the rest of the set!&quot;

Some sources credit Muntz with inventing the abbreviation &quot;TV&quot;. Muntz used skywriting as one of his marketing tactics, but, after watching one of his ads being created, he noted that the letters began to blur and dissipate before the pilot could finish spelling out &quot;Muntz Televisions&quot;. So Muntz came up with the abbreviation &quot;TV&quot;. However, &quot;TV&quot; had earlier been used in the call letters of television stations, such as WCBS-TV, which adopted those call letters in 1946. Muntz also named his daughter &quot;Tee Vee&quot;, although she normally went by &quot;Teena&quot; and, later, &quot;Tee&quot;.

==Audio and video: 1954–1985==
Despite his early success, sales later declined and Muntz&#x27;s creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954. Muntz admitted his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, and although he tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and went out of business in 1959. (The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s, but without its namesake at the helm.) However, Muntz&#x27;s success continued in the sales of cars and general consumer electronics.

===4-track cartridge===

Attempting to combine his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct predecessor of the Stereo 8 cartridge, also known as the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.

Muntz designed a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars and had it inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver to concentrate on the road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.

Muntz audio products were so profitable by 1962 that he cancelled his agreements with tape-duplicating companies and founded his own company to manufacture prerecorded Stereo-Pak cartridges. Most record companies did not manufacture Stereo-Pak cartridges themselves; however, the Muntz Electronics Corporation licensed music from all the major record labels and issued hundreds of different tapes in the mid to late 1960s. Muntz exhibited his Autostereo players and Stereo-Pak cartridges under the trade name &quot;Stereo-Pak&quot; at the 1967 Consumer Electronics Show.
The Autostereo player, which retailed from $129 in 1963 ($ in ) was a popular aftermarket addition to cars among the Beverly Hills rich and famous. Frank Sinatra used one in his Buick Riviera, Dean Martin in his Corvette, and Peter Lawford in his Ghia. James Garner, Red Skelton, and Lawrence Welk also used Autostereo players in their cars. Barry Goldwater purchased one for his son, and Jerry Lewis recorded his scripts onto Stereo-Pak cartridges to learn his lines while driving.

Muntz attempted to establish a modern, trendy image for his players and cartridges. His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive model with a suggestive tagline. Most of his employees in his California shops were attractive young women dressed in overbright clothing.

Bill Lear distributed the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, the result of which became the Stereo 8 system. The market for Muntz&#x27;s 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had wider heads resulting in better bandwidth, the Stereo 8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo 8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.

In a 1979 interview in &quot;The Videophile&quot;, Muntz revealed the biggest problem for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make hundreds of thousands of cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.

===Home video===
In late 1970, Muntz closed his Stereo-Pak audio business after a fire severely damaged his main offices. He then entered the growing home-video market. During the mid-1970s, Muntz thought of taking a Sony color cathode-ray tube (CRT) television receiver, fitting it with a special lens and reflecting mirror, then projecting the magnified image onto a larger screen. He housed these primitive units in a large wooden console, making it one of the first successful widescreen projection TV receivers marketed for home use.

The receivers were built in Muntz&#x27;s headquarters in Van Nuys, California. Sony&#x27;s U.S. sales division was unaware that Muntz was dealing directly with Sony&#x27;s Tokyo original equipment manufacturer (OEM) department, which shipped him the TV chassis directly. Thanks to Muntz&#x27;s talent for mass-market advertising and self-promotion, by 1977 the projection receivers were a multimillion-dollar business. Muntz was quick to feature Sony&#x27;s Betamax as well as JVC&#x27;s and RCA&#x27;s VHS recorders in his store, setting up a showroom to demonstrate the potential for a &quot;theater experience in the home&quot;.

In 1979, Muntz decided to sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract customers to his showroom, where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a  in (6 mm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz&#x27;s store closed soon after.

==Later years==
Shortly before dying of lung cancer in 1987, Muntz centered his retail business on cellular phones, satellite dishes, a motorhome rental company dubbed &quot;Muntz Motor Mansions&quot;, and prefabricated aluminum houses. He made headlines in February 1985 as the first retailer to offer a Hitachi cellular phone for less than $1,000 ($ in ), when just two years earlier most cellular phones had cost about $3,000 ($ in ). At the time of his death, he was the leading retailer of cellular phones in Los Angeles. During his final years, Muntz drove a customized Lincoln Continental with a television installed in the dashboard: Muntz claimed it helped him &quot;drive better&quot;.

After he died, his children, James and Tee, continued to operate two Muntz stores in Van Nuys and Newhall; the remainder of the stores were franchised businesses. James employed his father&#x27;s advertising techniques to create splashy ads featuring prices that annoyed his competitors so much that they referred to them as &quot;cutthroat&quot;.

==Legacy==

The &quot;Madman&quot; method pioneered by Muntz was later copied by other retailers, including California car salesman Cal Worthington and New York area electronics chain Crazy Eddie. In Crazy Eddie TV commercials, radio personality Jerry Carroll leapt at the camera and jumped around while jabbering at high speed, always ending with the line, &quot;Crazy Eddie: Our prices are insaaaaaane!&quot; As a result of his Crazy Eddie commercials, Carroll became a significant 80s icon, even appearing in the film &quot;Splash&quot;.

Muntz&#x27;s cultural impact was such that he was mentioned in novels, including children&#x27;s book &quot;The Neddiad: How Neddie Took The Train, Went To Hollywood, And Saved Civilization&quot; by Daniel Manus Pinkwater, &quot;The Lost Get-Back Boogie&quot; by James Lee Burke, and Franklin Mason&#x27;s &quot;Four Roses in Three Acts&quot;.

A production called &quot;Madman Muntz: American Maverick&quot; was screened at film festivals through 2007. Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it was produced by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz&#x27;s life, paying particular attention to his colorful career, and includes interviews with people who knew him and home movie footage contributed by his children.

The KCET 1997 documentary &quot;More Things That Aren&#x27;t Here Anymore&quot; has a segment on Muntz and is broadcast by the station regularly during pledge periods.

In 2001, Madman Muntz was posthumously inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.

<text>The Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes () is a ten-story obelisk that was erected as a national monument of China to the martyrs of revolutionary struggle during the 19th and 20th centuries. It is located in the southern part of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, in front of the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The obelisk monument was built in accordance with a resolution of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) adopted on November 30, 1949, with construction lasting from August 1952 to May 1958. The architect of the monument was Liang Sicheng, with some elements designed by his wife, Lin Huiyin. The civil engineer, Chen Zhide (陈志德) was also instrumental in realizing the final product.

The monument is 37.94 meters high, sitting south to north, from bottom to top for the pedestal, giant pedestal, the pedestal body, the top of the monument, the pedestal inlaid with eight large reliefs and two small reliefs, all to the theme of the major events of modern Chinese history. The center stone of the stele is taken from Laoshan Mountain, Qingdao, with &quot;Eternal glory to the people&#x27;s heroes&quot; handwritten by Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party Mao Zedong on the front, and the inscription written by Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai on the back. Since its construction, the monument has been repaired many times, and in 1961, the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes was listed as a Major cultural heritage sites under national-level protection.

== History ==
=== Preparation ===
After the liberation of Beiping, in September 1949, the first plenary session of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference decided to build a monument to the martyrs. Initially, the proposed sites included Babaoshan and Dongdan Square, but Tiananmen Square was finally chosen. The delegates who made the decision felt that the revolutionary tradition of the May Fourth Movement was present in front of Tiananmen Square, and that it would be convenient for people to come and pay their respects. The conference also adopted the inscription on the monument, written by Mao Zedong.
On September 24, 1949, a staff member of the CPPCC found the engraver Chen Zhijing in Liulichang, and ordered from him a copper lapis lazuli monument for laying the foundation stone, the pedestal was 2 feet high, the monument body was 5 feet high, 2 feet wide, and half a foot thick. on September 25, the monument&#x27;s inscription was handed over by the staff member to Chen Zhijing and his brother. The monument was completed on September 29th. In the second day, the foundation stone laying ceremony for the monument was held in Tiananmen Square, with all the representatives of the first CPPCC present. The foundation stone was laid by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Military Orchestra, which played the &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; and &quot;Wind Chimes&quot;, after which Mao Zedong read the monument&#x27;s inscription. Then, all the delegates and members of the CPPCC filled in the earth.

Shortly afterward, the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Commission solicited designs from all over the country. By 1951, during the one-year call period, the committee received a total of more than 140 design proposals. These designs can be generally categorized into three types - flat on the ground, giant sculptures, or towering monuments. The design forms of monuments include obelisks, monumental columns, and ancient Chinese monuments. These designs were finalized by the committee and were not adopted. The committee decided that the monument should be tall, and that only one of the two sides of the monument should have text, while the other side was temporarily vacant, so they asked Chairman Mao Zedong to inscribe the words &quot;People&#x27;s Heroes Forever&quot;, and Peng Zhen to ask Premier Zhou Enlai to write the inscription that had previously been written by Mao Zedong on the other side of the monument. After that, the Urban Planning Committee got inspiration from the &quot;Wanshoushan Kunming Lake&quot; monument in the Summer Palace and the &quot;Qiongdao Chunyin&quot; monument in the Beihai, and formed a feasible design that could be eventually constructed, but the theme for the top of the monument could not be determined at that time.

===Construction===
In May 1952, the Committee for the Construction of the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes was formally established. It was headed by Peng Zhen, with Zheng Zhenduo and Liang Sicheng as deputy directors, and Xue Zizheng as secretary-general. The entire People&#x27;s Heroes Monument Construction Committee has four specialized committees, namely:
* Construction Committee: members are Zheng Xiaoxie, Liu Guannan, Zhong Sen, Zhang Xiangfai, Wu Liusheng.
* Architectural Design Committee: members are Zhuang Jun, Yang Tingbao, Zheng Zhenduo, Zhang Bo, Zhu Zhaoxue, Zhao Zhengzhi, Lin Huiyin, Mo Zongjiang, Wu Liangyong, Wang Zhaowen, Chen Zhanxiang. Besides, Xue Zizheng, Wu Huaqing, Liang Sijing were present. Liang Sicheng was the convenor.
* Structural Design Specialized Committee: members are Yang Kuanlin, Chen Zhizhong, Chen Liangsheng, Mao Yisheng, Cai Fangyin, Lin Shibe, Chen Zhide, Bian Weide, Wang Mingzhi. The convenor is Zhu Zhaoxue.
* Sculpture and Painting Committee: members are Fan Wenlan, Liu Dainian, Rong Mengyuan, Zheng Zhenduo, Wang Yeqiu, Jiang Feng, Wang Zhenwen, Chen Yi, Mu Chuhuang, Pei Tong. The convener is Fan Wenlan.

In mid-July 1952, the Historical Material Committee put forward the theme of the bas-relief program. The scheme consisted of nine panels, initially including Jinggang Mountains, Boxer Rebellion, Pingxingguan, Sanyuanli, Guerrilla Warfare, and the Long March, but the relevant themes were not finalized at this time.

On August 1, 1952, the construction of the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes officially started. Monument stone mining from the Laoshan Mountain, the handling of seamless steel pipe billet bottom, with a steel wire rope and three tractors connected to the mountains from the Qingdao Railway Station, transported smoothly. Railroad department prepared from the small Fengman hydroelectric power station to transfer the train wagon can carry 90 tons. On October 13, 1953, the stone was transported to Xizhimen Railway Station. The Committee then changed the design of the monument from south to north to north-south in order to rationalize the layout of the site for subsequent events. On March 6 and 7, 1955, the installation of the two monuments was completed, using two cranes with a total capacity of 30 tons in combination with a pulley block and a high boom. After the army surveying and mapping department enlarged the handwritten characters of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai by taking photos, Liu Kaiqiu dealt with the burrs caused by the enlargement, and then gave them to the stonemasons to be traced and engraved on the center stone of the monument. The stonemason used high-pressure water gun to spray the mineral sand way to carve the inscription, after the completion of the carving and then gilt the inscription, and finally successfully completed the processing of the monument center stone.

The construction of the monument was slowed down between 1952 and 1954 due to the failure to finalize the key designs for the top of the monument and the reliefs on the monument&#x27;s body. On November 6, 1954, the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government Committee met and agreed on the design of the reliefs and the top of the monument, confirming that the top of the monument would be an architectural top and abandoning the idea of a sculptural top. The bas-reliefs, on the other hand, formed the final version of 8 large and 2 small. The work related to the relief was completed by Liu Kaiqu. By the end of October and early November 1956, the bas-reliefs were all made, and by August 1, 1957, they were installed.
The Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes was officially completed in April 1958 and unveiled on May 1 of the same year. The monument cost a total of RMB 405,000 yuan to build.

==Structure ==
The Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes is located in Tiananmen Square, Dongcheng District, Beijing, the center is 440 meters away from the base of the Tiananmen Square wall, sitting in the south and facing the north, covering an area of 3,000 square meters, with a height of 37.94 meters. The whole monument is made of 13,000 pieces of granite and alabaster.

On the pedestal of the tablet are huge bas-reliefs depicting eight major revolutionary episodes, which can be read in chronological order in a clockwise direction from the east:
# Destruction of opium at Humen (1839), in the run-up to the First Opium War
# Jintian Uprising, the catalyst for the Taiping Revolution (1851)
# Wuchang Uprising, the catalyst for the Xinhai Revolution (1911)
# May 4th Movement (1919)
# May 30 Movement (1925)
# Nanchang Uprising (1927)
# War of Resistance Against Japan (1931-1945)
# Yangtze River Crossing Campaign of the Chinese Civil War (1949)

On the front of the monument is an inscription in Mao Zedong&#x27;s handwriting, which reads, &quot;Eternal glory to the people&#x27;s heroes!&quot; ().


On the back of the monument is an epitaph written by Zhou Enlai:

The time framing of since the 1840s was intended to encompass the China&#x27;s modern history beginning with the Opium Wars, thereby framing the period of the 1840s to the 1940s as an anti-imperialist and revolutionary century.

==Commemoration==

The conduct of commemoration activities at the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes is regulated by the Major Events Administration Office of the Tiananmen Area Administrative Committee.

After the National Day in 1959, Premier Zhou Enlai had planned to change the top of the monument to a material that could light up, for which the State Council collected dozens of new designs for the top of the monument for the design departments and colleges and universities across the country. However, due to the lack of better solutions, the revision plan was not pursued. In 1961, the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes was listed as a national key cultural relics protection unit. Since 1980, it has been customary for visiting foreign dignitaries, to lay wreaths at the monument when visiting Beijing. 

Starting from February 8, 2006, to July 14, 2006, construction crews began to repair the pedestal and railing of the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes, as well as to clean the bas-reliefs and the monument&#x27;s body, and to repair the cracks. In 2014, in order to meet the 65th anniversary of the founding of the new China, the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes was restored with a comprehensive cleaning and maintenance. In the same year, China established the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial Day, and on the day of the Memorial Day, Chinese national leaders were required to present flower baskets to the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes.

Enacted in 2018, Article 7 of the &quot;Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs&quot; () designates the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes as a permanent memorial facility to commemorate and honor the heroes and martyrs, as well as a symbol of the spirit of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation&#x27;s struggle for national independence and emancipation, the people&#x27;s freedom and happiness, and the country&#x27;s prosperity and strength in the modern era. The law further asserts that the monument and its name, inscription, inscriptions, bas-reliefs, graphics, symbols, etc., are subject to the law&#x27;s protection.

<doc id="553612" wikidata="Q1036906" url="?curid=553612" title="Histone acetyltransferase">
<text>Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are enzymes that acetylate conserved lysine amino acids on histone proteins by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to form ε-&quot;N&quot;-acetyllysine. DNA is wrapped around histones, and, by transferring an acetyl group to the histones, genes can be turned on and off. In general, histone acetylation increases gene expression.

In general, histone acetylation is linked to transcriptional activation and associated with euchromatin. Euchromatin, which is less densely compact, allows transcription factors to bind more easily to regulatory sites on DNA, causing transcriptional activation. When it was first discovered, it was thought that acetylation of lysine neutralizes the positive charge normally present, thus reducing affinity between histone and (negatively charged) DNA, which renders DNA more accessible to transcription factors. Research has emerged, since, to show that lysine acetylation and other posttranslational modifications of histones generate binding sites for specific protein–protein interaction domains, such as the acetyllysine-binding bromodomain. Histone acetyltransferases can also acetylate non-histone proteins, such as nuclear receptors and other transcription factors to facilitate gene expression.

== HAT families ==
HATs are traditionally divided into two different classes based on their subcellular localization. Type A HATs are located in the nucleus and are involved in the regulation of gene expression through acetylation of nucleosomal histones in the context of chromatin. They contain a bromodomain, which helps them recognize and bind to acetylated lysine residues on histone substrates. Gcn5, p300/CBP, and TAFII250 are some examples of type A HATs that cooperate with activators to enhance transcription. Type B HATs are located in the cytoplasm and are responsible for acetylating newly synthesized histones prior to their assembly into nucleosomes. These HATs lack a bromodomain, as their targets are unacetylated. The acetyl groups added by type B HATs to the histones are removed by HDACs once they enter the nucleus and are incorporated into chromatin. Hat1 is one of the few known examples of a type B HAT. Despite this historical classification of HATs, some HAT proteins function in multiple complexes or locations and would thus not easily fit into a particular class.

=== Gcn5-related &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferases (GNATs) ===
HATs can be grouped into several different families based on sequence homology as well as shared structural features and functional roles. The Gcn5-related &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family includes Gcn5, PCAF, Hat1, Elp3, Hpa2, Hpa3, ATF-2, and Nut1. These HATs are generally characterized by the presence of a bromodomain, and they are found to acetylate lysine residues on histones H2B, H3, and H4. All members of the GNAT family are characterized by up to four conserved motifs (A-D) found within the catalytic HAT domain. This includes the most highly conserved motif A, which contains an Arg/Gln-X-X-Gly-X-Gly/Ala sequence that is important for acetyl-CoA recognition and binding. The C motif is found in most GNATs, but it is not present in the majority of other known HATs. The yeast Gcn5 (general control nonderepressible-5) HAT is one of the best-characterized members of this family. It has four functional domains, including an N-terminal domain, a highly conserved catalytic (HAT) domain, an Ada2 interaction domain, and a C-terminal bromodomain. PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) and GCN5 are mammalian GNATs that share a high degree of homology throughout their sequences. These proteins have a 400-residue N-terminal region that is absent in yeast Gcn5, but their HAT functions are evolutionarily conserved with respect to the latter. Hat1 was the first HAT protein to be identified. It is responsible for most of the cytoplasmic HAT activity in yeast, and it binds strongly to histone H4 by virtue of its association with an additional subunit, Hat2. Elp3 is an example of a type A HAT found in yeast. It is part of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and plays a role in transcriptional elongation.

=== MYST HATs ===
The MYST family of HATs is named after its four founding members MOZ, Ybf2 (Sas3), Sas2, and Tip60. Other important members include Esa1, MOF, MORF, and HBO1. These HATs are typically characterized by the presence of zinc fingers and chromodomains, and they are found to acetylate lysine residues on histones H2A, H3, and H4. Several MYST family proteins contain zinc fingers as well as the highly conserved motif A found among GNATs that facilitates acetyl-CoA binding. A cysteine-rich region located in the N terminus of the HAT domain of MYST proteins is involved in zinc binding, which is essential for HAT activity. Tip60 (Tat-interactive protein, 60 kDa) was the first human MYST family member to exhibit HAT activity. Sas3 found in yeast is a homolog of MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein), which is an oncogene found in humans. Esa1 was the first essential HAT to be found in yeast, and MOF is its homolog in fruit flies. The HAT activity of the latter is required for the twofold increased transcription of the male X chromosome (dosage compensation) in flies. Human HBO1 (HAT bound to ORC1) was the first HAT shown to associate with components of the origin of replication complex. MORF (MOZ-related factor) exhibits very close homology to MOZ throughout its entire length. It contains an N-terminal repression region that decreases its HAT activity &quot;in vitro&quot; as well as a C-terminal activation domain that is functional in the absence of the HAT domain.

=== Others ===
In addition to those that are members of the GNAT and MYST families, there are several other proteins found typically in higher eukaryotes that exhibit HAT activity. These include p300/CBP, nuclear receptor coactivators (e.g., ACTR/SRC-1), TAFII250, TFIIIC, Rtt109, and CLOCK. p300/CBP are metazoan-specific and contain several zinc finger regions, a bromodomain, a catalytic (HAT) domain, and regions that interact with other transcription factors. Importantly, the HAT domain shows no sequence homology to other known HATs, and it is required for p300/CBP to function in transcriptional activation. In addition, these proteins contain several HAT domain motifs (A, B, and D) that are similar to those of the GNATs. They also possess a novel motif E that is homologous to sequences in the HAT domains of GNATs. TFIIIC is one of the general transcription factors involved in RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription. Three components in the human protein have been shown to possess independent HAT activity (hTFIIIC220, hTFIIIC110, and hTFIIIC90). Rtt109 is a fungal-specific HAT that requires association with histone chaperone proteins for activity. The HAT activities of the human TAFII250 and CLOCK coactivators have not been studied as extensively. TAFII250 is one of the TBP-associated factor subunits of TFIID, and it shares a Gly-X-Gly pattern with Gcn5 that is important for HAT activity. CLOCK is a circadian rhythm master regulator that functions with BMAL1 to carry out its HAT activity.

==== Nuclear receptor coactivators ====
Three important nuclear receptor coactivators that display HAT activity are SRC-1, ACTR, and TIF-2. Human SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1) is known to interact with p300/CBP and PCAF, and its HAT domain is located in its C-terminal region. ACTR (also known as RAC3, AIB1, and TRAM-1 in humans) shares significant sequence homology with SRC-1, in particular in the N-terminal and C-terminal (HAT) regions as well as in the receptor and coactivator interaction domains. ACTR also interacts with p300/CBP and PCAF. The former can prevent ACTR from binding to and activating its receptor by acetylating it in its receptor interaction domain. TIF-2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2; also known as GRIP1) is another nuclear receptor coactivator with HAT activity, and it also interacts with p300/CBP.

A table summarizing the different families of HATs along with their associated members, parent organisms, multisubunit complexes, histone substrates, and structural features is presented below.

== Overall structure ==
In general, HATs are characterized by a structurally conserved core region made up of a three-stranded β-sheet followed by a long α-helix parallel to and spanning one side of it. The core region, which corresponds to motifs A, B, and D of the GNAT proteins, is flanked on opposite sides by N- and C-terminal α/β segments that are structurally unique for a given HAT family. The central core and the flanking segments together form a cleft over the former, which is where histone substrates can bind prior to catalysis. While the central core domain (motif A in GNATs) is involved in acetyl-CoA binding and catalysis, the N- and C-terminal segments assist in binding histone substrates. Unique features related to the sequence and/or structure of the N- and C-terminal regions for different HAT families may help to explain some observed differences among HATs in histone substrate specificity. CoA binding has been observed to widen the histone binding groove in the central core by moving the C-terminal segment of Gcn5 outward. In addition, since contacts between CoA and protein facilitate the formation of favorable histone-protein contacts, it is likely that CoA binding precedes histone binding &quot;in vivo&quot;.

=== GNAT and MYST families ===
HATs in the GNAT family are most notably characterized by an approximately 160-residue HAT domain and a C-terminal bromodomain, which binds to acetylated lysine residues. Those in the MYST family have HAT domains that are about 250 residues in length. Many MYST proteins also contain a cysteine-rich, zinc-binding domain within the HAT region in addition to an N-terminal chromodomain, which binds to methylated lysine residues.

On a broader scale, the structures of the catalytic domains of GNAT proteins (Gcn5, PCAF) exhibit a mixed α/β globular fold with a total of five α-helices and six β-strands. The overall topology resembles a vise, with the central core of the protein at the base and the N- and C-terminal segments on the sides.

=== p300/CBP family ===
The p300/CBP HATs have larger HAT domains (about 500 residues) than those present in the GNAT and MYST families. They also contain a bromodomain as well as three cysteine/histidine-rich domains that are thought to mediate interactions with other proteins. The structure of p300/CBP is characterized by an elongated globular domain, which contains a seven-stranded β-sheet in the center that is surrounded by nine α-helices and several loops. The structure of the central core region associated with acetyl-CoA binding is conserved with respect to GNAT and MYST HATs, but there are many structural differences in the regions flanking this central core. Overall, the structural data is consistent with the fact that p300/CBP HATs are more promiscuous than GNAT and MYST HATs with respect to substrate binding.

=== Rtt109 ===
The structure of Rtt109 is very similar to that of p300, despite there only being 7% sequence identity between the two proteins. There is a seven-stranded β-sheet that is surrounded by α-helices as well as a loop that is involved in acetyl-CoA substrate binding. Despite the conserved structure, Rtt109 and p300/CBP are functionally unique. For instance, the substrate binding site of the former is more similar to that of the GNAT and MYST HATs. In addition, the residues in the active site of each enzyme are distinct, which suggests that they employ different catalytic mechanisms for acetyl group transfer.

== Catalytic mechanisms ==
The basic mechanism catalyzed by HATs involves the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the ε-amino group of a target lysine side-chain within a histone. Different families of HATs employ unique strategies in order to effect such a transformation.

=== GNAT family ===
Members of the GNAT family have a conserved glutamate residue that acts as a general base for catalyzing the nucleophilic attack of the lysine amine on the acetyl-CoA thioester bond. These HATs use an ordered sequential bi-bi mechanism wherein both substrates (acetyl-CoA and histone) must bind to form a ternary complex with the enzyme before catalysis can occur. Acetyl-CoA binds first, followed by the histone substrate. A conserved glutamate residue (Glu173 in yeast Gcn5) activates a water molecule for removal of a proton from the amine group on lysine, which activates it for direct nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of enzyme-bound acetyl-CoA. After the reaction, the acetylated histone is released first followed by CoA.

=== MYST family ===
Studies of yeast Esa1 from the MYST family of HATs have revealed a ping-pong mechanism involving conserved glutamate and cysteine residues. The first part of the reaction involves the formation of a covalent intermediate in which a cysteine residue becomes acetylated following nucleophilic attack of this residue on the carbonyl carbon of acetyl-CoA. Then, a glutamate residue acts as a general base to facilitate transfer of the acetyl group from the cysteine to the histone substrate in a manner analogous to the mechanism used by GNATs. When Esa1 is assembled in the piccolo NuA4 complex, it loses its dependence on the cysteine residue for catalysis, which suggests that the reaction may proceed via a ternary bi-bi mechanism when the enzyme is part of a physiologically relevant multiprotein complex.

=== p300/CBP family ===
In human p300, Tyr1467 acts as a general acid and Trp1436 helps orient the target lysine residue of the histone substrate into the active site. These two residues are highly conserved within the p300/CBP HAT family and, unlike enzymes in the GNAT and MYST families, p300 does not employ a general base for catalysis. Rather, it is likely that members of the p300/CBP family use a Theorell-Chance (i.e., “hit-and-run”) acetyl transfer mechanism.

=== Rtt109 ===
Rtt109 is likely to employ a mechanism that is different from that of the other HATs. The yeast enzyme has very low catalytic activity in the absence of the histone chaperone proteins Asf1 and Vps75, which may be involved in delivering histone substrates to the enzyme for acetylation. Moreover, a general acid or base have not yet been identified for this HAT.

== Substrate binding and specificity ==
The structures of several HAT domains bound to acetyl-CoA and histone substrate peptides reveal that the latter bind across a groove on the protein that is formed by the central core region at the base and is flanked on opposite sides by the variable N- and C-terminal segments that mediate the majority of the interactions with the substrate peptide. It is likely that these variable regions are at least in part responsible for the observed specificity of different HATs for various histone substrates.

Members of the GNAT and MYST families as well as Rtt109 exhibit greater substrate selectivity than p300/CBP, which is rather promiscuous with regard to substrate binding. Whereas it appears that only three to five residues on either side of the lysine to be acetylated are necessary for effective substrate binding and catalysis by members of the GNAT and p300/CBP families, more distal regions of the substrate may be important for efficient acetylation by MYST family HATs.

=== Lysine selectivity ===
Different HATs, usually in the context of multisubunit complexes, have been shown to acetylate specific lysine residues in histones.

==== GNAT family ====
Gcn5 cannot acetylate nucleosomal histones in the absence of other protein factors. In the context of complexes like SAGA and ADA, however, Gcn5 is able to acetylate H3K14 among other sites within histones H2B, H3, and H4 (e.g., H3K9, H3K36, H4K8, H4K16). Both Gcn5 and PCAF have the strongest site preference for H3K14, either as a free histone or within a nucleosome. Hat1 acetylates H4K5 and H4K12, and Hpa2 acetylates H3K14 &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==== MYST family ====
In flies, acetylation of H4K16 on the male X chromosome by MOF in the context of the MSL complex is correlated with transcriptional upregulation as a mechanism for dosage compensation in these organisms. In humans, the MSL complex carries out the majority of genome-wide H4K16 acetylation. In the context of their cognate complexes, Sas2 (SAS) and Esa1 (NuA4) also carry out acetylation of H4K16, in particular in the telomere regions of chromosomes. Sas2 is also observed to acetylate H3K14 &quot;in vitro&quot; on free histones. Esa1 can also acetylate H3K14 &quot;in vitro&quot; on free histones as well as H2AK5, H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 either &quot;in vitro&quot; or &quot;in vivo&quot; on nucleosomal histones. H2AK7 and H2BK16 are also observed to be acetylated by Esa1 &quot;in vivo&quot;. Notably, neither Sas2 nor Esa1 can acetylate nucleosomal histones &quot;in vitro&quot; as a free enzyme. This happens to be the case as well for Sas3, which is observed to acetylate H3K9 and H3K14 &quot;in vivo&quot; as well as lysine residues on H2A and H4. MOZ can also acetylate H3K14.

==== Others ====
p300/CBP acetylate all four nucleosomal core histones equally well. &quot;In vitro&quot;, they have been observed to acetylate H2AK5, H2BK12, H2BK15, H3K14, H3K18, H4K5, and H4K8. SRC-1 acetylates H3K9 and H3K14, TAFII230 (Drosophila homolog of human TAFII250) acetylates H3K14, and Rtt109 acetylates H3K9, H3K23, and H3K56 in the presence of either Asf1 or Vps75.

=== Non-histone substrates (&quot;in vitro&quot;) ===
In addition to the core histones, certain HATs acetylate a number of other cellular proteins including transcriptional activators, basal transcription factors, structural proteins, polyamines, and proteins involved in nuclear import. Acetylation of these proteins can alter their ability to interact with their cognate DNA and/or protein substrates. The idea that acetylation can affect protein function in this manner has led to inquiry regarding the role of acetyltransferases in signal transduction pathways and whether an appropriate analogy to kinases and phosphorylation events can be made in this respect.

==== PCAF ====
PCAF and p300/CBP are the main HATs that have been observed to acetylate a number of non-histone proteins. For PCAF, these include the non-histone chromatin (high-mobility group (HMG)) proteins HMG-N2/HMG17 and HMG-I(Y), the transcriptional activators p53, MyoD, E2F(1-3), and HIV Tat, and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF. Other proteins include CIITA, Brm (chromatin remodeler), NF-κB (p65), TAL1/SCL, Beta2/NeuroD, C/EBPβ, IRF2, IRF7, YY1, KLF13, EVI1, AME, ER81, and the androgen receptor (AR). PCAF has also been observed to acetylate c-MYC, GATA-2, retinoblastoma (Rb), Ku70, and E1A adenovirus protein. It can also autoacetylate, which facilitates intramolecular interactions with its bromodomain that may be involved in the regulation of its HAT activity.

==== p300/CBP ====
p300/CBP have many non-histone substrates, including the non-histone chromatin proteins HMG1, HMG-N1/HMG14, and HMG-I(Y), the transcriptional activators p53, c-Myb, GATA-1, EKLF, TCF, and HIV Tat, the nuclear receptor coactivators ACTR, SRC-1, and TIF-2, and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF. Other substrates include the transcription factors Sp1, KLF5, FOXO1, MEF2C, SRY, GATA-4, and HNF-6, HMG-B2, STAT3, the androgen and estrogen (α) receptors, GATA-2, GATA-3, MyoD, E2F(1-3), p73α, retinoblastoma (Rb), NF-κB (p50, p65), Smad7, importin-α, Ku70, YAP1, E1A adenovirus protein, and S-HDAg (hepatitis delta virus small delta antigen). p300/CBP have also been observed to acetylate β-catenin, RIP140, PCNA, the DNA metabolic enzymes flap endonuclease-1, thymine DNA glycosylase, and Werner syndrome DNA helicase, STAT6, Runx1 (AML1), UBF, Beta2/NeuroD, CREB, c-Jun, C/EBPβ, NF-E2, SREBP, IRF2, Sp3, YY1, KLF13, EVI1, BCL6, HNF-4, ER81 and FOXO4 (AFX).

=== Multisubunit HAT complexes ===
The formation of multisubunit complexes has been observed to modulate the substrate specificity of HATs. In general, while recombinant HATs are able to acetylate free histones, HATs can acetylate nucleosomal histones only when they are in their respective &quot;in vivo&quot; HAT complexes. Some of the proteins that associate with HATs in these complexes function by targeting the HAT complex to nucleosomes at specific regions in the genome. For instance, it has been observed that HAT complexes (e.g. SAGA, NuA3) often use methylated histones as docking sites so that the catalytic HAT subunit can carry out histone acetylation more effectively.

In addition, the formation of multisubunit HAT complexes influences the lysine specificity of HATs. The specific lysine residues that a given HAT acetylates may become either broader or more restricted in scope upon association with its respective complex. For example, the lysine specificity of MYST family HATs toward their histone substrates becomes more restricted when they associate with their complexes. In contrast, Gcn5 acquires the ability to acetylate multiple sites in both histones H2B and H3 when it joins other subunits to form the SAGA and ADA complexes. Moreover, the acetylation site specificity of Rtt109 is dictated by its association with either Vps75 or Asf1. When in complex with the former, Rtt109 acetylates H3K9 and H3K27, but, when in complex with the latter, it preferentially acetylates H3K56.

== Regulation of HAT activity ==
The catalytic activity of HATs is regulated by two types of mechanisms: (1) interaction with regulatory protein subunits and (2) autoacetylation. A given HAT may be regulated in multiple ways, and the same effector may actually lead to different outcomes under different conditions. Although it is clear that the association of HATs with multiprotein complexes provides a mechanism for the regulation of both HAT activity and substrate specificity &quot;in vivo&quot;, the molecular basis for how this actually occurs is still largely unknown. However, data suggests that associated subunits may contribute to catalysis at least in part by facilitating productive binding of the HAT complex to its native histone substrates.

The MYST family of HATs, p300/CBP, and Rtt109 have all been shown to be regulated by autoacetylation. Human MOF as well as yeast Esa1 and Sas2 are autoacetylated at a conserved active site lysine residue, and this modification is required for their function &quot;in vivo&quot;. Human p300 contains a highly basic loop embedded in the middle of its HAT domain that is hyperacetylated in the active form of the enzyme. It has been proposed that, upon autoacetylation, this loop is released from the electronegative substrate binding site where it sits in the inactive HAT. Acetylation of yeast Rtt109 at Lys290 is also required for it to exhibit full catalytic activity. Some HATs are also inhibited by acetylation. For example, the HAT activity of the nuclear receptor coactivator ACTR is inhibited upon acetylation by p300/CBP.

== Interaction with HDACs ==
Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are recruited to their target promoters through physical interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors. They usually function within a multisubunit complex in which the other subunits are necessary for them to modify histone residues around the binding site. These enzymes can also modify non-histone proteins.

== Biological role ==

=== Chromatin remodeling ===
Histone acetyltransferases serve many biological roles inside the cell. Chromatin is a combination of proteins and DNA found in the nucleus, and it undergoes many structural changes as different cellular events such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription occur. Chromatin in the cell can be found in two states: condensed and uncondensed. The latter, known as euchromatin, is transcriptionally active, whereas the former, known as heterochromatin, is transcriptionally inactive. Histones comprise the protein portion of chromatin. There are five different histone proteins: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. A core histone is formed when two of each histone subtype, excluding H1, form a quaternary complex. This octameric complex, in association with the 147 base pairs of DNA coiled around it, forms the nucleosome. Histone H1 locks the nucleosome complex together, and it is the last protein to bind in the complex.

Histones tend to be positively charged proteins with N-terminal tails that stem from the core. The phosphodiester backbone of DNA is negative, which allows for strong ionic interactions between histone proteins and DNA. Histone acetyltransferases transfer an acetyl group to specific lysine residues on histones, which neutralizes their positive charge and thus reduces the strong interactions between the histone and DNA. Acetylation is also thought to perturb interactions between individual nucleosomes and act as interaction sites for other DNA-associated proteins.

There can be different levels of histone acetylation as well as other types of modifications, allowing the cell to have control over the level of chromatin packing during different cellular events such as replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. Acetylation is not the only regulatory post-translational modification to histones that dictates chromatin structure; methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, and ubiquitination have also been reported. These combinations of different covalent modifications on the N-terminal tails of histones have been referred to as the histone code, and it is thought that this code may be heritable and preserved in the next cell generation.

H3 and H4 histone proteins are the primary targets of HATs, but H2A and H2B are also acetylated &quot;in vivo&quot;. Lysines 9, 14, 18, and 23 of H3 and lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 of H4 are all targeted for acetylation. Lysines 5, 12, 15, and 20 are acetylated on histone H2B, while only lysines 5 and 9 have been observed to be acetylated on histone H2A. With so many different sites for acetylation, a high level of specificity can be achieved in triggering specific responses. An example of this specificity is when histone H4 is acetylated at lysines 5 and 12. This acetylation pattern has been seen during histone synthesis. Another example is acetylation of H4K16, which has been associated with dosage compensation of the male X chromosome in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

===Gene expression===
Histone modifications modulate the packing of chromatin. The level of packing of the DNA is important for gene transcription, since the transcriptional machinery must have access to the promoter in order for transcription to occur. Neutralization of charged lysine residues by HATs allows for the chromatin to decondense so that this machinery has access to the gene to be transcribed. However, acetylation is not always associated with enhanced transcriptional activity. For instance, acetylation of H4K12 has been associated with condensed and transcriptionally inactive chromatin. In addition, some histone modifications are associated with both enhanced and repressed activity, in a context-dependent manner.

HATs act as transcriptional co-activators or gene silencers and are most often found in large complexes made up of 10 to 20 subunits, some of which shared among different HAT complexes. These complexes include SAGA (Spt/Ada/Gcn5L acetyltransferase), PCAF, ADA (transcriptional adaptor), TFIID (transcription factor II D), TFTC (TBP-free TAF-containing complex), and NuA3/NuA4 (nucleosomal acetyltransferases of H3 and H4). These complexes modulate HAT specificity by bringing HATs to their target genes where they can then acetylate nucleosomal histones. Some HAT transcriptional co-activators contain a bromodomain, a 110-amino acid module that recognizes acetylated lysine residues and is functionally linked to the co-activators in the regulation of transcription.

==Clinical significance==
The ability of histone acetyltransferases to manipulate chromatin structure and lay an epigenetic framework makes them essential in cell maintenance and survival. The process of chromatin remodeling involves several enzymes, including HATs, that assist in the reformation of nucleosomes and are required for DNA damage repair systems to function. HATs have been implicated as accessories to disease progression, specifically in neurodegenerative disorders. For instance, Huntington&#x27;s disease is a disease that affects motor skills and mental abilities. The only known mutation that has been implicated in the disease is in the N-terminal region of the protein huntingtin (htt). It has been reported that htt directly interacts with HATs and represses the catalytic activity of p300/CBP and PCAF &quot;in vitro&quot;.

The human premature aging syndrome Hutchinson Gilford progeria is caused by a mutational defect in the processing of lamin A, a nuclear matrix protein. In a mouse model of this condition, recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage is delayed. The molecular mechanism underlying this delayed repair response involves a histone acetylation defect. Specifically, histone H4 is hypoacetylated at a lysine 16 residue (H4K16) and this defect is due to reduced association of histone acetyltransferase, Mof, to the nuclear matrix

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is a neurodegenerative disease that arises as a result of a defective mutant Ataxin-1 protein. Mutant Ataxin-1 reduces histone acetylation resulting in repressed histone acetyltransferase-mediated transcription.

HATs have also been associated with control of learning and memory functions. Studies have shown that mice without PCAF or CBP display evidence of neurodegeneration. Mice with PCAF deletion are incompetent with respect to learning, and those with CBP deletion seem to suffer from long-term memory loss.

The misregulation of the equilibrium between acetylation and deacetylation has also been associated with the manifestation of certain cancers. If histone acetyltransferases are inhibited, then damaged DNA may not be repaired, eventually leading to cell death. Controlling the chromatin remodeling process within cancer cells may provide a novel drug target for cancer research. Attacking these enzymes within cancer cells could lead to increased apoptosis due to high accumulation of DNA damage. One such inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases is called garcinol. This compound is found within the rinds of the garcinia indica fruit, otherwise known as mangosteen. To explore the effects of garcinol on histone acetyltransferases, researchers used HeLa cells. The cells underwent irradiation, creating double-strand breaks within the DNA, and garcinol was introduced into the cells to see if it influenced the DNA damage response. If garcinol is successful at inhibiting the process of non-homologous end joining, a DNA repair mechanism that shows preference in fixing double-strand breaks, then it may serve as a radiosensitizer, a molecule that increases the sensitivity of cells to radiation damage. Increases in radiosensitivity may increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy.

<text>The Virginia Military District was an approximately 4.2 million acre (17,000 km2) area of land in what is now the state of Ohio that was reserved by Virginia to use as payment in lieu of cash for its veterans of the American Revolutionary War.

Virginia had historic claims to much of the Northwest Territory, which included Ohio, dating from its colonial charter. Virginia and the other states ceded their claims over western lands to overcome other states&#x27; objections to ratifying the Articles of Confederation. In return for ceding its claims in 1784, Virginia was granted this area to provide military bounty land grants. The Ohio district was a surplus reserve, in that military land grants were first made in an area southeast of the Ohio River, in what is now Kentucky. The Ohio land was to be used only after the land southeast of the river was exhausted.

==Location==
The land was located in southern Ohio, bordered by the Ohio River on the south, the Little Miami River on the west, and the Scioto River on the east and the north. The District encompassed all of the following Ohio counties: Adams, Brown, Clinton, Clermont, Highland, Fayette, Madison, and Union, and portions of these counties: Scioto, Pike, Ross, Pickaway, Franklin, Delaware, Marion, Hardin, Logan, Clark, Greene, Champaign. Warren, Hamilton, and Auglaize.

==Settlement==
The District was opened for settlement in 1794, although surveys had begun in the 1780s. Surveys were done using the metes and bounds method used in Virginia, rather than the Public Land Survey System established by the Land Ordinance of 1785 used for most of the Northwest Territory. The precise boundaries of the district was a subject of contention for many years, involving multiple acts of Congress and a Supreme Court decision (&quot;Doddridge vs. Thompson et al.,&quot; 9 Wheaton 469). Further complicating the matter was the ambiguous location of the line established with the Treaty of Greenville, which separated Native American lands from lands open to white settlers and which ran through the northern portion of the District.

Virginia issued bounty land grants in this District until Ohio became a state in 1803. However, rampant land speculation and outright frauds produced a contentious muddle in land titles for many years afterward. Congress extended the time allowed for claims to be made several times. The last extension act was passed on March 3, 1855, allowing two years for claims made prior to January 1, 1852, to be surveyed and patented. After two years, unsurveyed lands became property of the United States. On February 18, 1871, this unsurveyed and unsold land was ceded by the federal government to the state of Ohio.

In 1872, the Ohio legislature gave this land to the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (now the Ohio State University). The college trustees aggressively claimed lands where there was not clear title, sometimes uprooting families who had been farming the land for 75 years. This caused such an uproar that Congress was forced to act, and on May 27, 1880, passed legislation limiting the rights of the college to unappropriated lands. Some provisions of this legislation opened the doors to a new round of legal wrangling.

Massie&#x27;s Station (now Manchester, Ohio), founded in 1791, was the first permanent settlement in the District, named after Nathaniel Massie, a surveyor and land speculator. He also founded Chillicothe, Ohio in 1796.

Many Virginians who settled in the area never owned slaves, although numerous settlers freed or sold their slaves before departing for Ohio, due to the provisions of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

==Process of claiming land==
Virginia soldiers of the Continental line, who served in the Revolutionary War, were eligible to procure a bounty award in the form of land, according to a formula based on rank and time of service. The first step was to secure a proper certificate of service and then to acquire a printed warrant from the land office in Virginia specifying the quantity of land. This warrant empowered the person to whom it was given, or heirs and assignees, to select the specified area from anywhere within the military reserve district. After the location was chosen and boundaries surveyed, the owner of the warrant exchanged it for a patent, which was equivalent to a deed in fee simple and passed all title of the government to the holder.

Significant numbers of the warrants were sold, and it was estimated that 25% of the District was purchased by 25 men. The land was never divided into regular townships, as in the Public Lands Survey System. Instead, land was divided based on the Virginia custom of &quot;metes and bounds.&quot; Land boundaries were defined by natural features—trees, boulders, and bodies of water. This resulted in irregularly-shaped land claims, as claimants vied to get the best land. As a result, there were frequently competing and overlapping claims.

== Surveyors == 

* Richard Clough Anderson Sr.—principal surveyor 1783 - 1819
* William Marshall Anderson—son of Richard Clough Anderson Sr.
* Joseph Kerr
* Allen Latham—son-in-law of Richard Clough Anderson
* Nathaniel Massie—1791, 1793–1796.

<text>The Great Hall of the People is a state building situated to the west of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It is used for legislative and ceremonial activities by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The People&#x27;s Great Hall functions as the meeting place for the full sessions of China&#x27;s legislature, the National People&#x27;s Congress, which occurs every year during March along with the national session of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory body. The Great Hall is also the meeting place of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which, since the 12th conference in 1982, has occurred once every five years, and the party&#x27;s Central Committee which meets approximately once a year.

The Hall is also used for many special events, including national level meetings of various social and political organizations, large anniversary celebrations, as well as the memorial services for former leaders. The Great Hall of the People is also a popular attraction in the city frequented by tourists visiting the capital.

==History==

After the first Five-year plans of China was completed ahead of schedule in 1956, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began to consider building a larger auditorium in Beijing. At the Beidaihe meeting in late August 1958, the CCP Central Committee decided to build a number of major architectural projects in Beijing including the Great Hall of Ten Thousand People, and requested that it be put into use in October 1959 before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Since the decision to build to be completed in just over a year and a month, time is very intensive. 

On September 5, 1958, Wan Li, the vice mayor of Beijing, conveyed the central government on the preparations for the 10th Anniversary. Beijing immediately set up by Feng Peizhi responsible for the National Day Project Design Leading Group and by Zhang Bo as the chief architect of the Great Hall Design Group, in a very short period of time selected the design of the Great Hall of the eight programs, and in a wide range of opinions on the basis of Tsinghua University, Beijing Municipal Bureau of Planning Administration Design Institute (President Shen Bo), Beijing Municipal Bureau of Planning Administration, to draft a comprehensive program respectively. In early September 1958, the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau determined that the Great Hall of Ten Thousand People and the Museum of Revolutionary History would be located on both sides of Tiananmen Square.
In the early morning of September 9, 1959, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the CCP Central Committee, visited the construction site. During the visit, Wan Li, the vice mayor of Beijing, suggested that the Great Hall of the People had not yet been officially named. After some discussion, Mao finalized the name &quot;Great Hall of the People&quot;. In that night, the Great Hall was fully completed and put into use, and Mei Lanfang performed &quot;the Drunken Beauty&quot; () in the 10,000-strong auditorium to show his condolences to the construction troops.

The Great Hall of the People was opened in September 1959 as one of the &quot;Ten Great Constructions&quot; completed for the 10th Anniversary of the PRC. The decision to build the Hall was made by the politburo in August 1958. Zhou Enlai believed the final design should give the message that &quot;the people are the masters of the country&quot;. After design proposals were submitted, a group of architects from across the country chose the winning design by Zhao Dongri and Shen Qi. Zhang Bo was appointed as the chief architect. The construction took 10 months, 7,785 workers and was fashioned with military-like strategies that emulated the Great Leap Forward.

On December 19, 2007, approved by the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government, the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics included the Great Hall of the People building in the List of Beijing Outstanding Modern and Contemporary Architectures ().

==Description==

Designed to symbolize the national unity and ethnic equality of the nation, the Great Hall embodied the new Chinese character of time in its features, proportion and details. The building covers of floor space, it is in length and in width. The centre&#x27;s highest point reaches . At the eaves of the main gate hangs the national emblem of the PRC.

The Great Hall of the People consists of three sections.
#The central section principally includes the Great Auditorium, the Main Auditorium, the Congress Hall (Standing Committee of SCPCC meets in conference), the Central Hall, the Golden Hall and other main halls.
#The northern section consists of the State Banquet Hall, the Salute State Guest Hall, the North Hall, the East Hall, the West Hall and other large halls.
#The southern part is the office building of the Standing Committee of the People&#x27;s Congress of China.
Among them, the central hall covers an area of 3,600 square meters. The retaining walls and floor are paved with colored marble. There are 20 white marble pillars around. There is a -wide corridor on the middle floor. There are 6 main entrances leading to the Great Hall of Ten Thousands.

Each province, special administrative region, autonomous region of China has its own hall in the Great Hall, such as Beijing Hall, Hong Kong Hall and Hainan Hall. Each hall has the unique characteristics of the province and is furnished according to the local style.

Upon its completion, the Great Hall became China&#x27;s largest auditorium which had previously been the Sun Yat-sen Auditorium. The Great Auditorium, with volume of , seats 3,693 in the lower floor, 3,515 in the balcony, 2,518 in the gallery and 300 to 500 on the dais. Government leaders make their speeches; and the representatives do much of their business. It can simultaneously seat 10,000 representatives. The ceiling is decorated with a galaxy of lights, with a large red star is at the centre of the ceiling, and a pattern of a water waves nearby represents the people. Its facilities equipped with audio-visual and other systems adaptable to a variety of meeting types and sizes. A simultaneous interpretation system is also provided with a language booth.

The State Banquet Hall with an area of can entertain 7,000 guests, and up to 5,000 people can dine at one time (as was done on the occasion of Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China). Smaller gatherings can be held in the Main Auditorium, with larger groups having the use of one or more of the conference halls, such as Golden Hall and North Hall, and the smallest assemblies accommodated in one or more of the over 30 conference halls that are named after provinces and regions in China.

==Usage==
The Great Hall of the People is the political hub of Beijing and home of the National People&#x27;s Congress. Every year, in March, the Great Hall of the People plays host to the &quot;liang hui&quot; (literally means &quot;two meetings&quot;) event, where both the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) meet in sessions lasting for two to three weeks at the Great Auditorium. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also holds its National Congress every five years in the Great Hall of the People.

After the Great Hall of the People was built in 1959, it was open to the public for one or two days every week. After the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution, the Great Hall of the People was closed and used only for large-scale meetings and the offices of central leaders, receiving activities. The issue of opening the Great Hall of the People to the public was brought up again after Cultural Revolution. At the evening of January 27, 1979, Deng Yingchao, on behalf of the CCP Central Committee, announced that &quot;the Great Hall of the People will be open to the masses.&quot; From July 15, the Great Hall of the People was reopened to the public. Since then it has eased the pressure on its finances by charging admission fees for visiting the hall and by generating income from the kiosks. Subsequently, by the end of the 1980s it had become self-supporting in terms of administrative expenses.

The Great Hall has been used for meetings with foreign dignitaries on state or working visits, as well as large anniversary celebrations attended by top leaders. 
The Great Hall has been used for the state funerals and memorial services for several top leaders. In 1982 Former President Liu Shaoqi was granted a state funeral held at the Great Hall. The Great Hall also held the funerals of General Secretary Hu Yaobang in 1989, as well as the state funerals for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1997, and Jiang Zemin in 2022. (Mao Zedong&#x27;s funeral ceremony was not held at the Great Hall; it was held at Tiananmen Square.)

The building and its main &quot;Great Auditorium&quot; are open to the public as a tourist attraction when it is not in use. Some non-political conventions and concerts have also been held in the Great Hall. On July 4, 1986, tenor singer Luciano Pavarotti held a solo concert in the Great Hall of the People, becoming the first foreigner ,and westerner, to perform in the Great Hall of the People.

In October 2003, Riverdance, the Irish music and dance entertainment phenomenon, was the first show from the West to perform in the Great Hall of the People, Beijing, with eleven sold-out performances. In January 2009, American country music trio Lucy Angel became the first American group to be invited to perform at the Great Hall of the People, doing so before an audience of dignitaries and government officials.

<doc id="553628" wikidata="Q592324" url="?curid=553628" title="Immunofluorescence">
<text>Immunofluorescence (IF) is a light microscopy-based technique that allows detection and localization of a wide variety of target biomolecules within a cell or tissue at a quantitative level. The technique utilizes the binding specificity of antibodies and antigens. The specific region an antibody recognizes on an antigen is called an epitope. Several antibodies can recognize the same epitope but differ in their binding affinity. The antibody with the higher affinity for a specific epitope will surpass antibodies with a lower affinity for the same epitope.

By conjugating the antibody to a fluorophore, the position of the target biomolecule is visualized by exciting the fluorophore and measuring the emission of light in a specific predefined wavelength using a fluorescence microscope. It is imperative that the binding of the fluorophore to the antibody itself does not interfere with the immunological specificity of the antibody or the binding capacity of its antigen.

Immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining (using antibodies to stain proteins) and is a specific example of immunohistochemistry (the use of the antibody-antigen relationship in tissues). This technique primarily utilizes fluorophores to visualize the location of the antibodies, while others provoke a color change in the environment containing the antigen of interest or make use of a radioactive label. Immunofluorescent techniques that utilized labelled antibodies was conceptualized in the 1940s by Albert H. Coons.

Immunofluorescence is employed in foundational scientific investigations and clinical diagnostic endeavors, showcasing its multifaceted utility across diverse substrates, including tissue sections, cultured cell lines, or individual cells. Its usage includes analysis of the distribution of proteins, glycans, small biological and non-biological molecules, and visualization of structures such as intermediate-sized filaments.

If the topology of a cell membrane is undetermined, epitope insertion into proteins can be used in conjunction with immunofluorescence to determine structures within the cell membrane. Immunofluorescence (IF) can also be used as a “semi-quantitative” method to gain insight into the levels and localization patterns of DNA methylation. IF can additionally be used in combination with other, non-antibody methods of fluorescent staining, e.g., the use of DAPI to label DNA.

Examination of immunofluorescence specimens can be conducted utilizing various microscope configurations, including the epifluorescence microscope, confocal microscope, and widefield microscope.

==Types==

=== Preparation of fluorescence ===
To perform immunofluorescence staining, a fluorophore must be conjugated (“tagged”) to an antibody. Staining procedures can be applied to both retained intracellular expressed antibodies, or to cell surface antigens on living cells. There are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary (direct) and secondary (indirect). The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies.

===Primary (direct)===

Primary (direct) immunofluorescence (DIF) uses a single antibody, conjugated to a fluorophore. The antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region, called the epitope. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the type of fluorophore, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited.

The direct attachment of the fluorophore to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the sample preparation procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal during analysis. This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity, and possible mistakes throughout the process. One disadvantage of DIF is the limited number of antibodies that can bind to the antigen. This limitation may reduce sensitivity to the technique. When the target protein is available in only small concentrations, a better approach would be secondary IF, which is considered to be more sensitive than DIF when compared to Secondary (Indirect) Immunofluorescence.
===Secondary (indirect)===
Secondary (indirect) immunofluorescence (SIF) is similar to direct immunofluorescence, however the technique utilizes two types of antibodies whereas only one of them have a conjugated fluorophore. The antibody with the conjugated fluorophore is referred to as the secondary antibody, while the unconjugated is referred to as the primary antibody.

The principle of this technique is that the primary antibody specifically binds to the epitope on the target molecule, whereas the secondary antibody, with the conjugated fluorophore, recognizes and binds to the primary antibody.  

This technique is considered to be more sensitive than primary immunofluorescence, because multiple secondary antibodies can bind to the same primary antibody. The increased number of fluorophore molecules per antigen increases the amount of emitted light, and thus amplifies the signal. There are different methods for attaining a higher fluorophore-antigen ratio such as the Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC method) and Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin (LSAB method).

==Limitations==

Immunofluorescence is only limited to fixed (i.e. dead) cells, when studying structures within the cell, as antibodies generally do not penetrate intact cellular or subcellular membranes in living cells, because they are large proteins. To visualize these structures, antigenic material must be fixed firmly on its natural localization inside the cell. To study structures within living cells, in combination with fluorescence, one can utilize recombinant proteins containing fluorescent protein domains, e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP). The GFP-technique involves altering the genetic information of the cells.

A significant problem with immunofluorescence is photobleaching, the fluorophores permanent loss of ability to emit light. To mitigate the risk of photobleaching one can employ different strategies. By reducing or limiting the intensity, or timespan of light exposure, the absorption-emission cycle of fluorescent light is decreased, thus preserving the fluorophores functionality. One can also increase the concentration of fluorophores, or opt for more robust fluorophores that exhibit resilience against photobleaching such as Alexa Fluors, Seta Fluors, or DyLight Fluors.

Other problems that may arise when using immunofluorescence techniques include autofluorescence, spectral overlap and non-specific staining. Autofluorescence includes the natural fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Spectral overlap happens when a fluorophore has a broad emission specter, that overlaps with the specter of another fluorophore, thus giving rise to false signals. Non-specific staining occurs when the antibody, containing the fluorophore, binds to unintended proteins because of sufficient similarity in the epitope. This can lead to false positives.

== Advances ==
The main improvements to immunofluorescence lie in the development of fluorophores and fluorescent microscopes. Fluorophores can be structurally modified to improve brightness and photostability, while preserving spectral properties and cell permeability.

Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods can produce images with a higher resolution than those microscopes imposed by the diffraction limit. This enables the determination of structural details within the cell. Super-resolution in fluorescence, more specifically, refers to the ability of a microscope to prevent the simultaneous fluorescence of adjacent spectrally identical fluorophores (spectral overlap). Some of the recently developed super-resolution fluorescent microscope methods include stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, saturated structured-illumination microscopy (SSIM), fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).

<doc id="553633" wikidata="Q1607791" url="?curid=553633" title="Legion (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Legion (David Charles Haller) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, typically as a villain or supporting character in stories featuring the X-Men and related characters.

He is the mutant son of Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness, including a form of dissociative identity disorder in which each of his identities exhibits different mutant abilities or powers.

The character made his live-action debut in the television series &quot;Legion&quot; (2017–19), portrayed by Dan Stevens.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz, Legion first appeared following the conclusion of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #25 (March 1985) in Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s notes, leading to his full story appearance in the following issue, &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #26 (April 1985).

In 1991, Legion was assigned to be a co-starring character in the newly revamped &quot;X-Factor&quot;, as a member of the eponymous superteam. However, writer Peter David was uncomfortable with this, and ultimately editor Bob Harras independently came to the conclusion that Legion should not be used in the series. David explained &quot;I don&#x27;t mind building a story around [Legion], but working him into a group – you&#x27;re really asking for a bit much from the reader. Believing that a group of people will come together to form a team is enough of a suspension of disbelief... &#x27;Oh, by the way, one of them is so nuts he shouldn&#x27;t be setting foot off Muir Island&#x27;... that&#x27;s asking the reader to bend so far he will break.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
While working in an Israeli psychiatric facility, Charles Xavier met a patient named Gabrielle Haller. The two had an affair which ended amicably. Gabrielle became pregnant with David, but did not tell Charles.

David, at a young age, was living with his mother and godfather, Daniel Shomron, in Paris when his home was attacked by anti-Semitic terrorists and his godfather was killed. The trauma of the situation caused an initial manifestation of David&#x27;s mutant powers, as David incinerated the minds of the terrorists. In the process, he unintentionally absorbed the mind of terrorist leader Jemail Karami and was rendered catatonic for years. As he recovered, he was moved to Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s care at the Muir Island research facility. The trauma, possibly in conjunction with his powers, caused David&#x27;s mind to dissociate chronically until he developed dissociative identity disorder, each alter manifesting different mutant abilities.

The Karami alter, which manifested telepathic abilities, struggled for years to separate his consciousness from David&#x27;s. In the process, Karami tried to unify as many alters as he could, trying to end David&#x27;s catatonic state. Some of the alters resisted Karami, most notably Jack Wayne, a swaggering adventurer who was telekinetic, and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who was pyrokinetic. Ultimately Karami, Wayne, and Cyndi continued to exist as David&#x27;s most prominent alters.

During his time at Muir Island, David saved Moira and Wolfsbane from a fatal accident by accessing the telekinetic abilities of his Jack Wayne alter. However, this allowed Wayne to take control of David&#x27;s body, and he left the island. The New Mutants tracked him down and, after a struggle, convinced Wayne to allow David to again assume control. Soon after, David was possessed by the Shadow King. While under the Shadow King&#x27;s influence, David killed the mutant Destiny and destroyed 2/3 of the island. When the X-Men and X-Factor defeated the Shadow King, David was again left in a coma.

===Legion Quest/Age of Apocalypse===
Years later, David awoke from his coma believing his psyche fully healed. When he had killed the mutant precog Destiny, David had absorbed her psyche. Destiny gave David vague prophetic guidance about the great world that could exist &quot;if only, years ago, Professor X had been given a real chance to fulfill his dream.&quot; David understood these words as a directive to travel back in time and kill Magneto, Xavier&#x27;s greatest adversary, to allow Professor X to achieve the dream of human-mutant coexistence.

As the X-Men attempt to stop him, Legion travels twenty years into the past, accidentally taking the X-Men with him. When Legion attempts to kill Magneto, Xavier intervenes and is killed, erasing Legion from existence and creating the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline.

Ultimately, Bishop repairs the timeline by enlisting the aid of the new reality&#x27;s X-Men to travel back in time to the moment of Xavier&#x27;s murder. There, Bishop confronted Legion, using David&#x27;s own power to create a psionic loop that showed him the damage that his actions would cause. David allowed the energy released in this process to incinerate him, in his last moments apologizing for what he had done.&quot;

While David was considered deceased, some of his alternate personalities manifest as spirits and begin terrorizing Israel, where David had been born. Excalibur was called to stop them. However, Meggan uses her empathy to calm their rage, convincing them to go &quot;towards the light.&quot;

===Return===
It is later revealed that David was transported to Otherplace, a timeless interdimensional limbo, and manifested thousands of alternate personalities. David wandered through Otherplace for an untold period of time, trying to return home. Magik, a mutant able to travel across dimensions, contacted one of David&#x27;s alters, &quot;The Legion,&quot; who could alter reality at a cosmic scale. Magik offered to guide Legion back to this dimension, provided that The Legion would aid her by destroying her nemeses, the Elder Gods.

David re-manifested in the physical world, although his primary personality had been imprisoned in his mindscape by his other alters, allowing the more malicious alters to control his body. One of these alters killed and absorbed the mind of a young girl, Marci Sobol, who became another alter within Legion. Legion battles the X-Men before Karma and Magik help him regain control of his body. Afterwards, he is placed in the care of Professor X, Doctor Nemesis, Danger, and Rogue.

Weeks later, Magik brings the Elder Gods to Earth and causes catastrophic destruction across the world. As the various mutant teams battle the Gods, Karma awakens The Legion to fulfill its bargain, erasing the Gods from existence and resetting the world to before they had manifested. After this, David is taken back into the care and treatment of the X-Men.

===Age of X===
Believing that David&#x27;s psyche would be healed if his alters were quarantined, Doctor Nemesis began to catalog and contain these alters within David&#x27;s mind. Unbeknownst to Doctor Nemesis and Professor Xavier, however, David&#x27;s mind subconsciously perceived this intervention as a threat and created a &quot;psychic antibody,&quot; a powerful new personality, to defend itself. The new personality had access to a degree of David&#x27;s underlying ability to alter reality and time. Assuming the appearance of the deceased Moira McTaggert, the personality attempted to &#x27;protect&#x27; Legion from the &#x27;assault&#x27; on his mind by creating a pocket reality where Legion was the hero that he always wanted to be. Many members of various X-teams were also brought into this new reality, which existed separately from Marvel&#x27;s primary continuity.

The alternate pocket reality, the Age of X, was a dystopia in which mutants had been hunted almost to extinction; the remaining mutants were kept alive by Legion&#x27;s mutant team, who generated a force wall to repel attacking human forces. Legion himself remained unaware that one of his personalities had created this world, and most of the mutants who had been brought into the reality by &#x27;Moira&#x27; believed that they had always been there. Within this pocket reality the &#x27;Moira&#x27; personality was practically omnipotent, creating and controlling random soldiers for Legion and the other mutants to kill. Eventually, Legacy, the alternate Rogue, discovered that &#x27;Moira&#x27; had in fact created this reality. Confronted with this truth, Legion spoke to &#x27;Moira,&#x27; who tearfully offered to create as many universes for him as he wanted. Instead, David absorbed &#x27;Moira&#x27; back into himself and erased the Age of X reality, restoring its participants to Earth-616 reality; ultimately, this entire timeline had lasted seven days in their normal continuity.

===Lost Legions===
With the Age of X incident underscoring the potentially apocalyptic scope of David&#x27;s power, Professor X proposed a new approach to help Legion retain control of himself. Instead of isolating David from the other alters in his mind, Professor X suggested that he learn to co-exist with them. To this end, Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries, and Reed Richards designed a Neural Switchboard Wristband for David that allows him to access the powers of his alternate selves without being controlled by them. However, this causes six of his alters to escape his mind. While tracking down and re-absorbing the alters, David accidentally absorbs Rogue and suffers severe nervous damage after releasing her time.

===The Fiend===
To aid his recovery, Professor X left Legion with Merzah the Mystic, a powerful empath and telepath who ran a Himalayan monastery. While at the monastery, David gained much greater control of himself, and he stopped using the Neural Switchboard Wristband. Under Merzah&#x27;s tutelage, David learned to visualize a facility in his mind where his alters could be kept and controlled. However, while David was at the monastery, Professor X was killed. When Legion sensed this, the mental shock caused a catastrophic release of energy that killed Merzah and everyone else at the monastery. In addition, without knowing it, David subconsciously created a new alter, The Fiend, who can kill other alters and absorb their powers.

In the final issue of &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;, Legion, reaching the full extent of his powers, decided to erase himself from existence.

===Trauma===
For unknown reasons (perhaps elements of his own psyche working against him), Legion&#x27;s attempt to erase himself from existence failed. When he reappeared, David&#x27;s mind was again fragmented into many alter, including a malicious new alter, &quot;Lord Trauma.&quot; Lord Trauma aimed to take over David&#x27;s mind and body by absorbing all of David&#x27;s other alters. In a desperate attempt to save himself, David sought out the help of renowned young psychotherapist Hannah Jones to delve into his fractured mind and fight back this dark alter While Jones was ultimately able to help Legion defeat Trauma, she remained trapped in David&#x27;s psyche (her body in a vegetative coma). To thank Jones, Legion placed her psyche into a dream state/alternate reality where she achieved her biggest goals.

=== X-Men Dissassembled ===
As the X-Men race around the globe to fight the temporal anomalies that have been springing up and to corral the hundreds of Madrox duplicates wreaking havoc, Legion arrives at the X-Mansion, seemingly in control of his powers and psyche. While the young X-Men try to ascertain what he wants, elsewhere Jean Grey and Psylocke team up to psychically purge whatever force is controlling the army of Madrox duplicates. Finding the prime Madrox imprisoned below the area where the army of duplicates are congregating, he explains that Legion imprisoned him and implanted his numerous alter and powers across the hundreds of duplicates. However, with his control broken, Legion goes berserk in the mansion, attacking the young X-Men and ranting about a vision of the future. The rest of the X-Men arrive to help but Legion singlehandedly takes on the whole team until he and Jean Grey go head-to-head. Legion then explains that he is trying to prevent a vision of the future – the arrival of the Horsemen of Salvation – but just as Legion mentions them, the Horsemen arrive.

===Reign of X===
After the X-Men establish Krakoa as a mutant nation, Legion is captured by Orchis and used to predict possible scenarios. They additionally create a psychic weapon that they use to manipulate Krakoa&#x27;s mutants. After rescuing Legion, Nightcrawler learns that the weapon is a restored Onslaught.

==Powers and abilities==

Legion is an Omega-level mutant who has dissociative identity disorder. Fundamentally, he has the ability to alter reality and time on a cosmic scale at will, but due to his multiple personalities, in practice his abilities vary depending on the dominant personality: each alter has different powers enabled by David&#x27;s subconscious manipulation of reality. The core personality, David Haller himself, generally does not manifest mutant abilities, but must access various personalities to use their power, sometimes losing control of himself to that personality. Some of Legion&#x27;s personalities physically transform his body (e.g., manifesting a prehensile tongue, becoming a woman, transforming into a werewolf, etc.). The first alter to manifest, Jemail Karami, was telepathic. Other prominent alters include Jack Wayne (telekinetic) and Cyndi (pyrokinetic). Legion has over a thousand different personalities (the exact number is unknown), and his mind can create additional alters in response to external or internal events.

The cumulative abilities of all his personalities make him one of the most powerful mutants in existence, if not the most powerful. Since the abilities of his personalities stem from his subconscious alteration of reality, Legion is theoretically capable of manifesting any power he can imagine. In two instances David has manifested the full extent of his ability to alter time and reality: in the first, he wiped the Elder Gods from existence and reset the universe to a state before the Elder Gods first appeared on Earth, and in the other he observed the entirety of spacetime and mended damage his personalities had done to it.

Legion can absorb other people&#x27;s psyches into his mind, either intentionally or, if he is next to them when they die, unintentionally. Conversely, in several instances Legion has had personalities manifest and act separately from him (or even against him) in the physical world; in most instances Legion has ultimately reabsorbed these personalities back into himself. Presumably, both his absorption of other psyches and the physical manifestations of his own personalities are enabled by Legion&#x27;s underlying ability to alter reality/time at will.

Generally, David&#x27;s ability to access and control his personalities/powers is closely tied to his self confidence and self esteem: the better he feels about himself, the more control he exercises. Unfortunately, David often suffers from self-doubt and self-recrimination, meaning that he must struggle to remain in control. Following the Age of X, David briefly used a Neural Switchboard Wristband engineered by Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries, and Reed Richards. This device allowed Legion to utilize a personality&#x27;s power set for several seconds without being overwhelmed by that personality. However, he soon abandoned this and attempted instead to develop a more organic control over his personalities.

===Personalities===
The following characters are different personalities of Legion that have appeared thus far, each one manifesting different powers:

* Through the personality of terrorist Jemail Karami (the name given to Personality #2), he has manifested telepathy.
* Through the personality of roustabout adventurer Jack Wayne (the name given to Personality #3), he has manifested telekinesis. This personality was often quite dangerous and would not hesitate to hurt or kill others if it would allow him to remain independent/free from David&#x27;s control. Eventually, Jack Wayne was subsumed by a different, malevolent Legion personality, Lord Trauma.
* Through the personality of the rebellious girl Cyndi (the name given to Personality #4), he has manifested pyrokinesis. This personality of Legion has a crush on Cypher.
* Through the personality of The Legion (the name given to Personality #5, which claims to be Legion&#x27;s &quot;real me&quot;), he can warp time and reality. Magik nicknamed this personality the &quot;God-Mutant.&quot;
* Through the personality of Sally (the name given to Personality #67), he has the appearance of an obese woman with Hulk-like super-strength.
* Through the personality of a punk rocker named Lucas (the name given to Personality #115), he can channel sound into energy blasts.
* Through Personality #181, he can enlarge himself to an undetermined size. This was the first power Legion utilized with the Neural Switchboard Wristband.
* Through the personality of Johnny Gomorrah (the name given to Personality #186), he can transmute his enemies and objects into salt.
* Through the personality of Time-Sink (the name given to Personality #227), he has the ability of time-manipulation. This rebellious personality was able to become independent from David but was eventually found and reabsorbed by David. David was ultimately forced to stop using Time-Sink&#x27;s powers because when David tried to access the personality, it would always fight to get back its freedom.
* Through Personality #302, he can move at supersonic speeds.
* Through the personality of Styx (the name given to Personality #666), he has the ability to absorb the consciousness of anyone he touches, turning that person&#x27;s body into a shell that he can then control. The possessed individual can still access any special abilities they have, and there does not appear to be a limit to the number of individuals simultaneously controlled. David considers this manipulative personality his most dangerous, because it is clever, cruel, and extremely ambitious. Styx was able to become independent from Legion, manifesting as a desiccated corpse, and tried to take control of Legion himself, so that he could use Legion&#x27;s reality-altering powers to remake the world according to his will. Legion, using the power of his Chain personality, managed to trick and reabsorb Styx.
* Through Personality #762, he becomes a pirate with the ability to belch an acidic gas.
* Through Personality #898, he becomes a centaur.
* Through the personality of Delphic (the name given to Personality #1012), he becomes a blue-skinned, seemingly-omniscient female seer who will answer any three questions from supplicants.

Legion personalities that have not been assigned numbers include:

* Absence is an alien/demon creature with its eyes sewn shut who claims to have traveled through different realities and can siphon heat and love.
* Bleeding Image is a living voodoo doll who can redirect and amplify the pain from any injury he inflicts on himself onto his victims. It later gains independence before being destroyed by Magneto.
* Chain is effectively a human virus who turns anyone he touches into a copy of himself with a new weapon. The power dissipates when the original is dealt with. This personality was able to become independent from David but he was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.
* Chronodon is a dinosaur with a clock on its face. Based on its name and appearance, it can be assumed that it can manipulate time in some way.
* Clown is a surly-looking clown who can blast energy from his mouth.
* Compass Rose can locate any person and teleport to them.
* The Delusionaut is a train driver with a billow stack for a head who uses the smoke that he exudes to create realistic illusions. He manifested outside of Legion to help him at one point, and eventually was one of the personalities that volunteered to meld together to form Gestalt. 
* Drexel is a foul-mouthed simpleton with super-strength.
* Endgame is a huge and aggressive armor that instantly manifests the perfect counter to any attack executed against it. This personality became independent from David, but it was eventually found and reabsorbed by David.
* The Fiend/&quot;Charles Xavier&quot; is a dangerous personality David created following the mental shock of the death of his father Professor X. The Fiend manifests as either a yellow goblin-like creature or in the guise of Professor X. The Fiend has significant psychic abilities, including precognition and possession, and can kill other Legion personalities in Legion&#x27;s mind, absorbing their power. Eventually, the Fiend became independent from David and tried to help him retain more control of himself.
* Findel the Finder can find anyone across the galaxy.
* Gestalt is a powerful fusion of several Legion personalities with the core personality of David himself, allowing the abilities of these personalities to manifest simultaneously under David&#x27;s control. Legion created Gestalt to successfully repel an attack on his mind.
* Hugh Davidson is a stereotypical prepster with a long prehensile tongue.
* Hunter is a macho-man personality David&#x27;s mind created to replace Jack Wayne, when that personality was subsumed by the Lord Trauma personality.
* Hypnobloke is a gentleman with flashing swirls for eyes who wears a top hat and carries a pocket watch. He has the power of hypnotic suggestion.
* Joe Fury is an angry young man who can generate flame and other types of energy, and whom David struggles to repress.
* Kirbax the Kraklar is a demonic creature that can fly and generate electricity.
* Ksenia Nadejda Panov is a Moscovite heiress, discus-throwing champion, caviar exporter, and torturer of puppies. She has the ability to generate ionic scalpels from her fingers.
* K-Zek the Conduit is an android with the ability of far-field, concentrated wireless energy transfer (or WET).
* Lord Trauma is a malevolent personality who can bring out the worst traumas a person has experienced and draw power from the psychic energies that result. This personality became independent from David and tried to absorb all his other personas to gain control of David&#x27;s body, although Trauma was eventually destroyed.
* Marci Sabol is a normal human girl who befriended David, but was killed and absorbed into him by the White Witch Doctor. She has significant influence within David&#x27;s mindscape. 
* Max Kelvin is a crotchety old man whose eyes protrude when he uses his powers of plasmatic flame generation.
* Moira Kinross/X is a mother figure created by David&#x27;s mind to protect his mindscape from tampering. This persona, which could warp reality, became independent from David and created the dystopian pocket reality dubbed &quot;Age of X&quot; where David was seen as a hero. Within this pocket reality X was practically omnipotent, altering the mindsets and personalities of the fabricated entities in her reality. 
* Mycolojester is a plant-like entity with the attire of a jester, who can emit toxic spores from his skin. These spores act as a powerful nerve gas, but can be dissipated by water. This personality volunteered to help David by merging with several other personalities to become Gestalt.
* Non-Newtonian Annie is a skinny purple woman dressed in pink clothes and cloaked in a &quot;zero-tau nullskin&quot; that does not conform to the law of conservation of energy (e.g., kinetic energy that hits it is immediately amplified and reflected directly back on its source).
* Origamist is one of the most powerful personalities in David&#x27;s mind. He is a reality-warping sumo wrestler who can fold spacetime, allowing, among other things, instant teleportation of any object to any location.
* Protozoan Porter is a large green leech-like being who can teleport by disassembling himself into minuscule ameboid-like parts that reassemble after reaching his destination. This personality volunteered to help David by merging with several other personalities to create Gestalt. 
* Pukatus Jr. is a small cherub-like demon who can vomit an acidic substance.
* Skinsmith can produce artificial skin on any surface or bend/alter the skin of others.
* Specs is a nervous young man with large glasses who can see through solid objects. This personality develops a romantic interest in Magma. 
* Susan in Sunshine is an innocent-looking blonde child with the ability to sense, augment and manipulate the emotions of those around her and, if she wishes, convert those emotions into destructive energy. This personality became independent from Legion, but she was eventually found and reabsorbed by him.
* Tami Haar is a nightclub singer who is a friend and companion to David. She appears to have a master knowledge of David&#x27;s mindscape, which among other things allows her to manifest in the real world.
* Tyrannix the Abominoid is a small hapless Cthulhu-like creature with telepathic powers. When David traveled within his mindscape, he often used Tyrannix as a backpack. Tyrannix was the first personality to volunteer to help David by melding to create Gestalt.
* The Weaver is a large arachnid creature who is wreathed in bright light. The Weaver can change and refabricate reality itself, and it is ultimately revealed to be either David&#x27;s core self or a mirror of David. When David and the Weaver unite, he can observe and alter all time and space at will; David, aware of the extent and implications of this godlike power, attempted to unmake himself by erasing his own birth. For unknown reasons his attempt failed (it may have been undermined by other aspects of David&#x27;s psyche), in the process creating the Lord Trauma personality.
* The White Witch Doctor is a murderous white man dressed as a witch doctor who killed Marci Sabol and absorbed her psyche into Legion, creating the Marci Sabol personality.
* Wormhole Wodo can open a wormhole between two points anywhere in the galaxy, allowing near instantaneous travel between them.

* Zero G. Priestly is a robed priest who floats upside down and can control gravity.
* Zubar is a personality that likes to call himself &quot;the Airshrike&quot; and has the power to levitate himself.

==Mentality==
Legion has been described as having dissociative identity disorder. In his first appearance he was also described as autistic, however this diagnosis has not been used since.

===Origin of name===
Legion&#x27;s name is derived from a passage in the Christian Bible (found in Mark 5 and Luke 8). In it, Jesus asks a man possessed by many evil spirits what his name is, to which the man replies &quot;I am Legion, for we are many&quot;.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Legion 21st in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, Comic Book Resources (CBR) ranked Legion 14th in their &quot;8 X-Men Kids Cooler Than Their Parents (And 7 Who Are Way Worse)&quot; list, and 1st in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of X===

In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality, Legion leads the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the &quot;Force Walls&quot; (telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X) on a daily basis to protect mutants from human attacks. Unlike his 616 counterpart, there is no trace of the other personalities shown. It is ultimately revealed that the Age of X reality was unconsciously created by Legion himself. A flashback reveals that in the 616 universe Professor X was arguing with Dr. Nemesis regarding the latter&#x27;s containment and deletion of Legion&#x27;s other personalities in an effort to stabilize him. While Dr. Nemesis claimed that everything was going according to his plan, Professor X was unconvinced and entered Legion&#x27;s mind. There he found the other personalities dead and their rotting corpses left in their containment units. This surprised Dr. Nemesis, who had thought that when a personality was deleted it should simply disappear. Professor X was then attacked by what he called a &quot;psychic antibody,&quot; a personality Legion had subconsciously created to defend against Nemesis&#x27;s deleting of the personalities. To overcome Professor X on the psychic plane, this personality took on the face of Moira MacTaggart and claimed that it would make a world where Legion could be happy. The &#x27;Moira&#x27; personality then reshaped Utopia into Fortress X and inserted itself as Moira and the supercomputer X. When finally confronted about its actions, the personality made the Force walls fall, allowing the human armies to attack. &#x27;Moira&#x27; announced her intention to destroy the 616 universe as well as the Age of X and to create a new safe place for David to live happily forever. Instead, David absorbed her and reverted the Fortress X to the normal reality, with a few modifications.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Proteus is a combination of Legion and Proteus from the mainstream comics. His mother is Moira MacTaggert and his father is Charles Xavier. He possesses Proteus&#x27; reality warping power and is named David Xavier. He escapes his mother&#x27;s facility, looking for his father, and murders hundreds to discredit him. David is later crushed by Colossus, while possessing S.T.R.I.K.E. agent Betsy Braddock inside a car.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Legion via David, Lucas, and an original personality named Ian, a young mute boy with pyrokinesis, appears in the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; episode &quot;Sins of the Son&quot;, voiced by Kyle Labine. This version&#x27;s body transforms to reflect the personality controlling him. Additionally, due to the series&#x27; younger target audience, his connection to Professor X is toned down.
* A character partially based on Legion named Takeo Sasaki appears in &quot;Marvel Anime: X-Men&quot;, voiced by Atsushi Abe in the Japanese version and by Steve Staley in the English dub. Similarly to Legion, Takeo is the son of Professor X. Additionally, while Legion himself does not appear, he is stated to be responsible for creating &quot;Demon-Hall Syndrome&quot;, a mutant affliction that manifests secondary mutations, such as multiple personalities, uncontrolled physical mutations, and psychological instability.
* David Haller / Legion appears in &quot;Legion&quot;, portrayed by Dan Stevens as an adult; Tobias Austen and Noah Hegglin Houben as an infant; Sebastian Billingsley-Rodriguez as a toddler, Christian Convery, Luke Rosseler, and Jacob Hoppenbrouwer in different stages of his childhood; and Alex Mulgrew as a teenager. This version was diagnosed with schizophrenia instead of dissociative identity disorder whose reality-warping abilities are often confused with psionic abilities such as telepathy and telekinesis. Throughout the first season, he enters a relationship with body-swapping mutant Sydney Barrett and discovers the Shadow King has lived in his mind since childhood before the latter possesses another psychic mutant named Oliver Bird. In the second season, David pursues the Shadow King, only to join forces with him to avert a future plague and become more psychopathic. In the third season, David starts a cult and recruits a mutant with time-traveling capabilities called Switch to help him warn his parents Professor X and Gabrielle Haller. However, he puts his mother into a catatonic state. Eventually, he confronts his father before attempting to kill the Shadow King for ruining his life, but reconciles with him instead, creating a new timeline in the process.
** Additionally, an alternate reality version of David resembling his comic book counterpart appears in the episode &quot;Chapter 18&quot;, also portrayed by Stevens.

==Collected editions==

<text>Edwin Markham (born Charles Edward Anson Markham; April 23, 1852 – March 7, 1940) was an American poet. From 1923 to 1931 he was Poet Laureate of Oregon.

==Early life and education==
Edwin Markham was born in Oregon City, Oregon, and was the youngest of 10 children; his parents divorced shortly after his birth. At the age of four, he moved with his mother to Lagoon Valley in Solano County, California. He obtained a teaching certificate in 1870 from Pacific Methodist College in Vacaville. Markham then attended San Jose Normal School (now San Jose State University) graduating in 1872, and wrote the poem &quot;The Man with the Hoe&quot;. The house in which he wrote the poem was preserved and moved to the city&#x27;s History Park, and now serves as a poetry center. He went by &quot;Charles&quot; until about 1895, when he was about 43, when he started using &quot;Edwin.&quot; He also studied at Christian College in Santa Rosa, California, in 1873.

==Career==
Markham taught literature in El Dorado County until 1879, when he became education superintendent of the county. While residing in El Dorado County, Markham became a member of Placerville Masonic Lodge. He also accepted a job as principal of Tompkins Observation School in Oakland, California, in 1890. While in Oakland, he became well acquainted with many other famous contemporary writers and poets, such as Joaquin Miller, Ina Coolbrith,and Charles Warren Stoddard.

Markham&#x27;s most famous poem, &quot;The Man with the Hoe,&quot; which accented laborers&#x27; hardships, was first presented at a public poetry reading in 1898. His main inspiration was a French painting of the same name (in French, &quot;L&#x27;homme à la houe&quot;) by Jean-François Millet. Markham&#x27;s poem was published, and it became quite popular very soon. In New York, he gave many lectures to labor groups. These happened as often as his poetry readings.

His 1904 edition of the works of Edgar Allan Poe was followed by multiple volumes of &quot;The Real America in Romance&quot;, issued from 1909 through 1927 by New York publisher W. H. Wise. His edited works included several collections of British and American poetry. An accomplished and popular lecturer, Markham also wrote essays, popular articles that discussed his own compositional approaches, and introductions to the works of others. Among the latter, his subjects included John Keats, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His efforts to raise public awareness of social ills were capped by contributions to a major volume examining child labor, &quot;Children in Bondage&quot;, in 1914.

In 1922, Markham&#x27;s poem &quot;Lincoln, the Man of the People&quot; was selected from 250 entries to be presented at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial. The author himself read the poem. Dr. Henry Van Dyke of Princeton said of the poem, &quot;Edwin Markham&#x27;s Lincoln is the greatest poem ever written on the immortal martyr, and the greatest that ever will be written.&quot; Later that year, Markham was filmed reciting the poem by Lee De Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process.

As recounted by literary biographer William R. Nash, &quot;&#x27;[&#x27;b]etween publications, Markham lectured and wrote in other genres, including essays and nonfiction prose. He also gave much of his time to organizations such as the Poetry Society of America, which he established in 1910. In 1922, at the conclusion to the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, Markham read a revised version of his poem, &quot;Lincoln the Man of the People.&quot; Markham also wrote a number of epigrams, of which the best known is &quot;Outwitted&quot;.

Throughout Markham&#x27;s later life, many readers viewed him as an important voice in American poetry, a position signified by honors such as his election in 1908 to the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Despite his numerous accolades, however, none of his later books achieved the success of the first two.

American etiquette expert Amy Vanderbilt has said that Markham&#x27;s single verse poem &quot;Circles of Love&quot; was written while Markham was a guest at her family home on Staten Island.

==Personal life==

In 1898, Markham married his third wife, Anna Catherine Murphy (1859–1938), and in 1899 their son Virgil Markham was born. They moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1900 to study natives and their appeasement, then to New York City, where they lived in Brooklyn and then Staten Island. 

==Legacy==
By the time of his death, Markham had amassed a huge library of over 15,000 books. This collection was bequeathed to Wagner College&#x27;s Horrmann Library on Staten Island. Markham also willed his personal papers to the library. His correspondents included Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ambrose Bierce, Aleister Crowley, Jack and Charmian London, Zoe Anderson Norris, Carl Sandburg, Florence Earle Coates and Amy Lowell.

Six schools in California were named in honor of Markham. Three schools, all named Edwin Markham Elementary School, are in Oakland, Vacaville and Hayward, and three more are Markham Middle School in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, Edwin Markham Middle School in Placerville, and Edwin Markham Junior High School in San Jose, the last since renamed Willow Glen Middle School.

Schools in other states named in his honor include Edwin Markham Intermediate School 51 in Staten Island, Edwin Markham Elementary north of Pasco, Washington, Edwin Markham Elementary School in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and Markham Elementary in Portland, Oregon.

In 1916, American composer Alice Marion Shaw set Markham’s text to music in her song “To Go and Forget.”

The Liberty Ship &quot;Edwin Markham&quot; was launched on May 5, 1942.

A street in the Palomares Hills neighborhood of Castro Valley, California bears his name (Edwin Markham Drive).

The Markham Houses is a complex on Staten Island, as is a street there.

Markham House, his residence until 1889, is now in History Park in San Jose, California and houses the Poetry Center San José.

A historical marker in Peña Adobe Park in Vacaville, California bears an engraving of Markham.

<text>Joseph Aspdin (25 December 1778 – 20 March 1855) was an English bricklayer, businessman, inventor, and stonemason who obtained the patent for Portland cement on 21 October 1824.

==Life==
Joseph Aspdin (or Aspden) was the eldest of the six children of Thomas Aspdin, a bricklayer living in the Hunslet district of Leeds, Yorkshire. He was baptised on Christmas Day, 1778. He entered his father&#x27;s trade, and married Mary Fotherby at Leeds Parish Church (the Parish Church of St Peter at Leeds) on 21 May 1811.

By 1817, he had set up in business on his own in central Leeds. He must have experimented with cement manufacture during the next few years, because on 21 October 1824 he was granted the British Patent BP 5022 entitled &quot;An Improvement in the Mode of Producing an Artificial Stone&quot;, in which he coined the term &quot;Portland cement&quot; by analogy with the Portland stone, an oolitic limestone that is quarried on the channel coast of England, on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. See below for the text of the patent.

Almost immediately after this, in 1825, in partnership with a Leeds neighbour, William Beverley, he set up a production plant for this product in Kirkgate, Wakefield. Beverley stayed in Leeds, but Aspdin and his family moved to Wakefield (about nine miles away) at this point. He obtained a second patent, for a method of making lime, in 1825. The Kirkgate plant was closed in 1838 after compulsory purchase of the land by the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company, and the site was cleared. He moved his equipment to a second site nearby in Kirkgate.

At this time his eldest son James was working as an accountant in Leeds, and his younger son, William, was running the plant. However, in 1841, Joseph went into partnership with James, and posted a notice that William had left, and that the company would not be responsible for his debts, stating &quot;I think it right to give notice that my late agent, William Aspdin, is not now in my employment, and that he is not authorised to receive any money, nor contract any debts on my behalf or on behalf of the new firm.&quot;

In 1843, William established his own plant at Rotherhithe, near London. There he introduced a new and substantially stronger cement, using a modified recipe for cement-making, the first &quot;modern&quot; Portland cement. In 1844 Joseph retired, transferring his share of the business to James. James moved to a third site at Ings Road in 1848, and this plant continued in operation until 1900. Joseph Aspdin died on 20 March 1855, at home in Wakefield.

==Patent==
The patent reads as follows:

TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, I, Joseph Aspdin, of Leeds, in the County of York, Bricklayer, send greeting. WHEREAS His present most Excellent Majesty King George the Fourth, by His Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain, bearing date at Westminster, the Twenty-first day of October, in the fifth year of His reign, did, for Himself, His heirs and successors, give and grant unto me, the said Joseph Aspdin, His special licence, that I, the said Joseph Aspdin, my exors, admors, and assigns, should at any time agree with, and no others, from time to time at all time during the term of years therein expressed, should and lawfully might make, use, exercise, and vend, within England, Wales and the Town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, my invention of &quot;AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE MODE OF PRODUCING AN ARTIFICIAL STONE;&quot; in which said Letters Patent there is contained a proviso obliging me, said Joseph Aspdin, by an instrument in writing under my hand and seal, particularly to describe and ascertain the nature of my said invention, and in what manner the same is to be performed, and to cause the same to be inrolled in his Majesty&#x27;s High Court of Chancery
within two calendar months next and immediately after the date of the said part recited Letters Patent (as in and by the same), reference being thereunto had, will more fully and at large appear.

NOW KNOW YE, that in compliance with the said proviso, I, the said Joseph Aspdin, do hereby declare the nature of my said Invention, and the manner in which the same is to be performed, are particularly described and ascertained in the following description thereof (that is to say):

My method of making a cement or artificial stone for stuccoing buildings, waterworks, cisterns, or any other purpose to which it may be applicable (and which I call Portland cement) is as follows:- I take a specific quantity of limestone, such as that generally used for making or repairing roads, and I take it from the roads after it is reduced to a puddle or powder; but if I cannot procure a sufficient quantity of the above from the roads, I obtain the limestone itself, and I cause the puddle or powder, or the limestone, as the case may be, to be calcined. I then take a specific quantity of argillaceous earth or clay, and mix them with water to a state approaching impalpability, either by manual labour or machinery. After this proceeding I put the above mixture into a slip pan for evaporation, either by heat of the sun or by submitting it to the action of fire or steam conveyed in flues or pipe under or near the pan till the water is entirely evaporated. Then I brake the said mixture into suitable lumps and calcine them in a furnace similar to a lime kiln till the carbonic acid is entirely expelled. The mixture so calcined is to be ground, beat, or rolled to a fine powder, and is then in a fit state for making cement or artificial stone. This powder is to be mixed with a sufficient quantity of water to bring it into the consistency of mortar, and thus applied to the purposes wanted.

In witness whereof, I, the said Joseph Aspdin, have hereunto set my hand seal, this Fifteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and twenty-four.

Signed: &quot;Joseph Aspdin&quot;

AND BE IT REMEMBERED, that on the Fifteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord 1824, and aforesaid Joseph Aspdin came before our said Lord the King in His Chancery, and acknowledged the Specification aforesaid, and all and every thing therein contained and specified, in form above written. And also the Specification aforesaid was stamped according to the tenor of the statute made for that purpose.

Inrolled the Eighteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and twenty-four.

==Implications of the patent==

Joseph Aspdin called the product Portland cement because set mortar made from it resembled “the best Portland stone&quot;. Portland stone was the most prestigious building stone in use in England at the time. The patent clearly does not describe the product recognised as Portland cement today. The product was aimed at the market for stuccos and architectural pre-cast mouldings, for which a fast-setting, low-strength cement was required (see cement). It was fired at low temperature (below 1250 °C) and therefore contained no alite (C3S: , tricalcium silicate).

The product belongs to the category of &quot;artificial cements&quot; that were developed to compete with James Parker&#x27;s Roman cement, and was similar to that developed much earlier by James Frost. The process described is a &quot;double burning&quot; process in which the limestone is burned on its own first, then slaked, mixed with clay, and burned again. This was a common practice for manufacturers of both Artificial and Portland cements when only hard limestones were available. The grinding technology of the time consisted only of flat millstones, and it was more economic to pulverize the limestone by burning and slaking than by grinding.

The limestone he used was the Pennines Carboniferous limestone of the area, which was used for paving in the towns and on the turnpike roads. The characteristic practise of the patent (and of his lime patent) is the use of &quot;road sweepings&quot; as a raw material. He says that if the sweepings are not available he obtains &#x27;the limestone itself&quot;. It is significant that Joseph Aspdin was twice prosecuted for digging up whole paving blocks from the local roads. Limestone supply was clearly a major headache for Aspdin in the days before stone could be brought in by rail.

His son William&#x27;s innovation was to make a mix with a higher limestone content, to burn it at a higher temperature using more fuel, and to grind the hitherto-discarded hard clinkered material, hence increasing wear-and-tear in the grinding process. However, William did not file for a patent on his modified process, and sometimes claimed his father&#x27;s patent. In 1848, William moved south to Northfleet, in Kent, where inexhaustible supplies of soft chalk were available. A history of &quot;financial missteps&quot; and questionable business arrangements suggests that William may have been both inept and dishonest. Nonetheless, he is credited with launching the &quot;modern&quot; Portland cement industry.

<text>In molecular biology, a chromatosome is a result of histone H1 binding to a nucleosome, which contains a histone octamer and DNA. The chromatosome contains 166 base pairs of DNA. 146 base pairs are from the DNA wrapped around the histone core of the nucleosome. The remaining 20 base pairs are from the DNA of histone H1 binding to the nucleosome. Histone H1, and its other variants, are referred to as linker histones. Protruding from the linker histone are linker DNA. Chromatosomes are connected to each other when the linker DNA of one chromatosome binds to the linker histone of another chromatosome.

<text>Montana Technological University, popularly known as Montana Tech, is a public university in Butte, Montana. Founded in 1900 as the Montana State School of Mines, the university became affiliated with the University of Montana in 1994. After undergoing several name changes, in 2017 the Montana University System Board of Regents voted to designate Montana Tech as part of Special Focus Four-Year Universities, the only such designation in the Montana University System. To recognize this new designation and the greater independence with it, the name was officially changed in 2018 from Montana Tech of the University of Montana to Montana Technological University. Montana Tech&#x27;s focus is on engineering, applied and health science.

In fall 2017, Montana Tech had nearly 2,700 students. It has 13 campus buildings and offers 39 undergraduate degrees along with 15 minors, 5 certification degrees, and 9 pre-professional career programs. Montana Tech also offers 18 graduate degrees and has Ph.D. programs in Materials Science and Engineering, Interdisciplinary Studies, and Earth Science and Engineering.

==History==
The Enabling Act of 1889, which brought Montana into the Union, allotted land for the creation of a school of mines as one of the four original Montana University System universities. In 1893 the Montana Legislature provided funding to establish the school in Butte. The cornerstone of Main Hall was laid in 1896, and the university opened its doors in 1900 as the Montana State School of Mines. The first student was a woman, Clara Clark of Butte, and Nathan R. Leonard acted as the first president. Despite enthusiastic local support, even offers of free land for construction, the early history of the school was fraught with poor funding and accusations of fraud, but with the help of former governor John E. Rickards, the school was opened.

In 1919 the Montana Legislature established the Montana State Bureau of Mines and Metallurgy on the campus in keeping with Montana Tech as a school focusing on the development of minerals and industry. Charles H. Clapp of the mining department served as the first president of the Bureau.

The school was renamed the Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology in 1965. It began moving beyond purely engineering and applied sciences, adding social science and liberal arts options. Alumni Coliseum opened on campus.

The university became affiliated with the University of Montana in 1994 with a reorganization of the Montana University System. The name was changed to Montana Tech of the University of Montana. The Butte Vocational-Technical Center was put under Montana Tech administration as the College of Technology. In 1998 Frank Gilmore became chancellor.

In 2010 the Natural Resource Building (NRB) opened. It now accommodates the Bureau of Mines and the Petroleum Engineering Department. In 2011 Don Blackketter became chancellor. In 2012 the College of Technology became Highlands College, and the Frank and Ann Gilmore University Relations Center (URC) building opened. The first Ph.D. program in Materials Science and Engineering began in 2014 in partnership with University of Montana and Montana State University. The Nursing Department began offering a full bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2015. In October 2021, the university announced a $7 million donation to the Nursing Department from Dave and Sherry Lesar. This led to renaming the Nursing Department the Sherry Lesar School of Nursing. These funds also contributed to the construction of the Lesar Family Nursing Simulation Center, which opened in spring 2022 in the Science &amp; Engineering building. In 2016, a full Bachelor&#x27;s of Mechanical Engineering program was added, and the Natural Resource Research Center opened on campus, including a new nano research lab and additional lab space for existing departments.

In 2017 the Montana Board of Regents designated Montana Tech as part of Special Focus Four-Year Universities, the only such designation in the Montana University System, in recognition of Tech&#x27;s focus on engineering, applied science and health science. This change gives greater independence by reporting directly to the Board of Regents and handling its own finances instead of through the University of Montana. To recognize this, in the summer of 2018, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Montana Technological University. Les Cook became chancellor in 2019.

On April 25, 2023, the university announced the largest donation in its history from Ryan Lance, CEO of ConocoPhillips. On September 21, 2023, the university&#x27;s School of Mines and Engineering was officially renamed the Lance College of Mines and Engineering by unanimous vote of the Montana University System Board of Regents.

<doc id="553665" wikidata="Q5980623" url="?curid=553665" title="Iain Sinclair">
<text>Iain Sinclair FRSL (born 11 June 1943) is a writer and filmmaker. Much of his work is rooted in London, recently within the influences of psychogeography.

==Early life and education==
Sinclair was born in Cardiff, Wales, on 11 June 1943. 

From 1956 to 1961, he was educated at Cheltenham College, a boarding school for boys, followed by Trinity College, Dublin (where he edited &quot;Icarus&quot;). He attended the Courtauld Institute of Art and the London School of Film Technique (now the London Film School).

==Career==
===Development as author===

Sinclair&#x27;s early work was mostly poetry, much of it published by his own small press, Albion Village Press. He was (and remains) connected with the British avant garde poetry scene of the 1960s and 1970s – authors such as Edward Dorn, J. H. Prynne, Douglas Oliver, Peter Ackroyd and Brian Catling are often quoted in his work and even turn up in fictionalized form as characters. Later, taking over from John Muckle, Sinclair edited the Paladin Poetry Series and, in 1996, the Picador anthology &quot;Conductors of Chaos&quot;.

His early books &quot;Lud Heat&quot; (1975) and &quot;Suicide Bridge&quot; (1979) were a mixture of essay, fiction, prose-poetry and poetry; they were followed by &quot;White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings&quot; (1987), a novel juxtaposing the tale of a disreputable band of bookdealers on the hunt for a priceless copy of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; and the Jack the Ripper murders (here attributed to the physician William Gull).

Sinclair was for some time perhaps best known for the novel &quot;Downriver&quot; (1991), which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the 1992 Encore Award. It envisages the UK under the rule of &#x27;the Widow&#x27;, a grotesque version of Margaret Thatcher as viewed by her harshest critics, who supposedly establishes a one-party state in a fifth term. &quot;Radon Daughters&quot;, a novel influenced by the work of William Hope Hodgson, formed the third part of a trilogy with &quot;White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings&quot; and &quot;Downriver.&quot;

The volume of essays &quot;Lights Out for the Territory&quot; gained Sinclair a wider readership by treating the material of his novels in non-fiction form. His essay &quot;Sorry Meniscus&quot; (1999) ridiculed the Millennium Dome. In 1997, he collaborated with Chris Petit, sculptor Steve Dilworth, and others to make &quot;The Falconer&quot;, a 56-minute semi-fictional &quot;documentary&quot; film set in London and the Outer Hebrides, about the British underground filmmaker Peter Whitehead. It also features Stewart Home, Kathy Acker and Howard Marks.

===Psychogeography===
A significant proportion of Sinclair&#x27;s work has consisted of an ambitious and elaborate literary recuperation of the so-called occultist psychogeography of London. Other psychogeographers who have worked on similar material include Will Self, Stewart Home, Michael Moorcock, Aidan Andrew Dun and the London Psychogeographical Association. 

One of a series of works focused around London is the non-fiction &quot;London Orbital&quot;, the hardcover edition of which was published in 2002, along with a documentary film of the same name and subject. It describes a series of trips he took tracing the M25, London&#x27;s outer-ring motorway, on foot. Sinclair followed this with &quot;Edge of the Orison&quot; in 2005, a psychogeographical reconstruction of the poet John Clare&#x27;s walk from Dr Matthew Allen&#x27;s private lunatic asylum, at Fairmead House, High Beach, in Epping Forest in Essex, to his home in Helpston, near Peterborough. Sinclair also writes about Claybury Asylum, another psychiatric hospital in Essex, in &quot;Rodinsky&#x27;s Room&quot;, a collaboration with the artist Rachel Lichtenstein. 

Sinclair&#x27;s book &quot;Ghost Milk&quot; criticized the British government for using the 2012 Summer Olympics as an excuse to militarize London while forcing the poorest citizens out of their homes. The 2012 games mark a shift in Sinclair&#x27;s psychogeographical writing, moving to a more documentary mode with fewer semi-fictional elements included in his work. In 2017 Sinclair published &quot;The Last London&quot;, a conscious move away from writing about &quot;A city so much estranged from its earlier identities (always shifting and revising) that it is unrecognisable.&quot; This marked the culmination of a series of works that detailed Sinclair&#x27;s attempts to grasp the changing nature of London and to re-map his own experiences of the city.

Sinclair&#x27;s own view of psychogeography later echoed many of the earlier criticisms of his work which focused on the commodification of &#x27;heritage zones&#x27; in less affluent areas of the city. In a 2016 interview, he stated: &quot;I don’t think there is any more than can be said. The topic has outlived its usefulness and become a brand.&quot;

===&quot;The Reforgotten&quot;===

A consistent theme in Sinclair&#x27;s non-fiction and semi-fictional works has been the rediscovery of writers who enjoyed success in the early 20th century, but have been largely forgotten. These writers predominantly focus on London, particularly the East London districts in which Sinclair has lived and worked. He has written about, championed and contributed introductory notes to novels by authors such as Robert Westerby, Roland Camberton, Alexander Baron and John Healy. His 2016 work &quot;My Favourite London Devils&quot; focused on his rediscovery and appreciation of these writers, often while working as a used book dealer. 

===Peru===
In June 2019, Sinclair travelled to Lima to begin retracing the journey of his great-grandfather, Arthur Sinclair, to &quot;the source of the Amazon&quot;. Travelling with his daughter, Farne, filmmaker Grant Gee, and poet and translator Adolfo Barberá del Rosal, the journey was expected to result in a range of artistic responses including podcasts, film and various books. The journey was partly funded by the British Film Institute&#x27;s documentary fund and part by crowdfunding. The expedition provided material for an essay-feature film entitled &quot;The Gold Machine&quot;, released in 2022. A book by Sinclair with the same title was also published in 2021. A small selection of prose-poetry inspired by the trip was published by Earthbound Press.

==Recognition and awards==
In an interview with &quot;This Week in Science&quot; in 2004, William Gibson said that Sinclair was his favourite author.

Sinclair was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2009. 

In 2013 he became a visiting professor at the University for the Creative Arts.

In October 2018, the University of Surrey reported that Sinclair had been appointed &quot;distinguished writer in residence&quot; with their School of Literature and Languages. 

==Personal life==
 Sinclair lived in Haggerston, in the London Borough of Hackney, and had a flat in Marine Court, the art deco building modelled after an ocean liner in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.

<doc id="553666" wikidata="Q1081023" url="?curid=553666" title="Bonneville Salt Flats">
<text>The Bonneville Salt Flats are a densely packed salt pan in Tooele County in northwestern Utah, United States. A remnant of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, it is the largest of many salt flats west of the Great Salt Lake. It is public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management and is known for land speed records at the Bonneville Speedway. The Flats is open to the public.

The Flats are about 12 miles (19 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) wide, with a crust almost 5 ft (1.5m) thick at the center and less than one inch (2.5 cm) towards the edges. It is estimated to hold 147 million tons of salt, about 90% of which is common table salt.

==History==
Geologist Grove Karl Gilbert named the area after Benjamin Bonneville, a U.S. Army officer who explored the Intermountain West in the 1830s. In 1907, Bill Rishel and two local businessmen tested the suitability of the salt for driving by taking a Pierce-Arrow onto its surface.

A railway line across the Flats was completed in 1910, marking the first permanent crossing. The first land speed record was set there in 1914 by Teddy Tetzlaff.

Several movies and television shows have included scenes shot at the Flats, including &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs Special - The Ballad of Big Al&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Warlock&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) and its sequel, &quot;SLC Punk&quot;, &quot;Cremaster 2&quot; from &quot;Cremaster Cycle&quot;, &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;, &quot;Gerry&quot;, &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

The Pontiac Bonneville (former flagship sedan of the Pontiac motor division), the Triumph Bonneville motorcycle, and the Bonneville International media company are all named for the Flats.

The Bonneville Salt Flats hosts the annual US Flight Archery Championships The goal of flight archery is to shoot arrows from bows at the greatest distance possible. The 1977 (archer Don Brown) and 1982 (archer Alan Webster) world records were set there. The current world record, achieved in 1987 (archer Don Brown), was set at the salt flats near Smith Creek, Nevada.
==Environmental concerns==

The thickness of salt crust is a critical factor in racing use of the salt flats. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has undertaken multiple studies on the topic; while a 2007 study determined that there was little change in the crust&#x27;s thickness from 1988 to 2003, more recent studies have shown a reduction in thickness, especially in the northwest area where racing occurs.

The flats&#x27; overall area has contracted over the past several decades. Many believe nearby evaporative potash mining is the primary factor.

Collaboration between racing organizations, the potash mine, and the BLM led to a pilot program begun in 1998 to release excess brine onto the salt flats during winter. Plans to increase the volume of brine returned to the salt flats are hoped to halt loss of crust thickness, or possibly restore it where it has become too thin to sustain human use.

==Land speed events==

Land speed records and Land speed racing records have been set many times on the Bonneville Salt Flats. The record for wheel-driven vehicles (449 MPH) was set there in 2018, and for rocket or jet propelled vehicles (630 MPH; since superseded) in 1970.

Motorcar racing has taken place at the salt flats since 1914. Racing takes place at part of the Bonneville Salt Flats known as the Bonneville Speedway. There are five major land speed events that take place at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Bonneville &quot;Speed Week&quot; takes place mid-August followed by &quot;World of Speed&quot; in September and the &quot;World Finals&quot; take place early October.

These three events welcome cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The &quot;Bub Motorcycle Speed Trials&quot; are for motorcycles only. World records are contested at the Mike Cook ShootOut in September. The Southern California Timing Association and the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association organizes and plans the multi-vehicle events, but all event promoters contribute to prepping and maintaining the salt. &quot;Speed Week&quot; events in August were canceled in 2015 and 2022, due to the poor condition of the salt in certain parts of the flats. The salt flats had been swamped by heavy rains earlier in the year, as usual, but this year the rains also triggered mudslides from surrounding mountains onto a section of the flats used for the land-speed racing courses.

==&quot;Stardust&quot;==
In 2004, the &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft released its sample-return capsule for a landing in the Bonneville Salt Flats after its flybys of asteroid 5535 Annefrank in 2002 and comet Wild 2 in 2004.

<text>Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity (published in paperback as Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity) is a 2004 book by law professor Lawrence Lessig that was released on the Internet under the Creative Commons Attribution/Non-commercial license on March 25, 2004.

This book documents how copyright power has expanded substantially since 1974 in five critical dimensions:
*duration (from 32 to 95 years),
*scope (from publishers to virtually everyone),
*reach (to every view on a computer),
*control (including &quot;derivative works&quot; defined so broadly that virtually any new content could be sued by some copyright holder as a &quot;derivative work&quot; of something), and
*concentration and integration of the media industry.

It also documents how this industry has successfully used the legal system to limit competition to the major media corporations through legal action against:
* College students for close to $100 &quot;billion&quot;, because their improvements of search engines made it easier for people in a &quot;university intranet&quot; to find copyrighted music placed by others in their &quot;public&quot; folder.
* Lawyers who advised MP3.com that they had reasonable grounds to believe streaming an MP3 uploaded by a customer only to computers that the customer has logged-in on for the service is legal, and
* Venture capitalists who funded Napster.

The result is a legal and economic environment that stifles &quot;the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;, exactly the opposite of the purpose cited in the US Constitution. It may not be possible today to produce another Mickey Mouse, because many of its early cartoon themes might be considered &quot;derivative works&quot; of some existing copyrighted material (as indicated in the subtitle to the hardback edition and in numerous examples in this book).

== Summary ==

This book is an outgrowth of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, which Lessig lost. Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution says, &quot;The Congress shall have Power... to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot; Several times in the past century, Congress has extended the copyright law in several ways. One way was to extend the term &quot;on the installment plan&quot;. Another was to broaden the scope to include not only copying but creating &quot;derivative works&quot;. This latter broadening is so ambiguous that it provides a foundation for massive abuse of power by companies holding large copyright portfolios. For example, the Recording Industry Association of America sued a freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) for $12,000 for improving a search engine used only inside RPI. Lessig cites another example where Fox demanded $10,000 for the rights to use a 4.5 second video clip with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; playing on a television in a corner of a scene in a documentary. Anyone producing a collage of video clips can potentially be similarly sued on the grounds the collage is a &quot;derivative work&quot; of something copyrighted or that the collage contains a shot that is copyrighted. Lessig argues that this substantially limits the growth of creative arts and culture, in violation of the US Constitution; the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the constitutional authority to properly balance competing interests on cases like this.

In the preface of &quot;Free Culture&quot;, Lessig compares this book with a previous book of his, &quot;Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace&quot;, which propounded that software has the effect of law. &quot;Free Culture&quot;&#x27;s message is different, Lessig writes, because it is &quot;about the consequence of the Internet to a part of our tradition that is much more fundamental, and, as hard as this is for a geek-wanna-be to admit, much more important.&quot; (pg. xiv)

Professor Lessig analyzes the tension that exists between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm in the context of what he calls the present &quot;depressingly compromised process of making law&quot; that has been captured in most nations by multinational corporations that are interested in the accumulation of capital and not the free exchange of ideas.

The book also chronicles his prosecution of &quot;Eldred&quot; and his attempt to develop the Eldred Act, also known as the &quot;Public Domain Enhancement Act&quot; or the &quot;Copyright Deregulation Act&quot;.

Lessig concludes his book by suggesting that as society evolves into an information society there is a choice to be made to decide if that society is to be or feudal in nature. In his afterword he suggests that free software pioneer Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation model of making content available is not against the capitalist approach that has allowed such corporate models as Westlaw and LexisNexis to have subscribers to pay for materials that are essentially in the public domain but with underlying licenses like those created by his organization &quot;Creative Commons.&quot;

He also argues for the creation of shorter renewable periods of copyright and a limitation on derivative rights, such as limiting a publisher&#x27;s ability to stop the publication of copies of an author&#x27;s book on the internet for non-commercial purposes or create a compulsory licensing scheme to ensure that creators obtain direct royalties for their works based upon their usage statistics and some kind of taxation scheme such as suggested by professor William Fisher of Harvard Law School that is similar to a longstanding proposal of Richard Stallman.

==Themes==

===Introduction and identification of a cultural shift===
Lessig defines &quot;free culture&quot; as analogous to &quot;free speech&quot; – that is, unrestricted. A free culture supports and protects its creators and innovators directly and indirectly. It directly supports creators and innovators by granting intellectual property rights. It indirectly supports them by ensuring that follow-on creators and innovators remain as free as possible from the creators of the past by limiting how extensive intellectual property rights are. A &quot;permission culture&quot; is the opposite of a free culture; in a permission culture, creators and innovators are only able to create and innovate with the permission of creators of the past – whether they are powerful creators or not.

Lessig presents two examples that provide some insight into the nature of these dueling cultures. In the first, an example of &quot;free culture&quot;, he describes how aircraft operators did not have to abide by an old law that land owners also owned the air above the property and thus could forbid overflight. In the second, an example of a &quot;permission culture&quot;, he describes how David Sarnoff, president of RCA, managed to persuade the United States government to delay the deployment of the rival wideband FM radio, invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong. He describes this as an example of how the inventor of a new invention can be forced to request &quot;permission&quot; from a previous inventor.

The disparate features of a free culture and a permission culture affect how culture is made. In a free culture, innovators are able to create – and build upon past creations – without the worry of infringing upon intellectual property rights. In a permission culture, innovators must first request &quot;permission&quot; from past creators in order to build upon or modify past creations. Oftentimes, the innovator must pay the past creator in order to obtain the permission needed to proceed. If the past creator refuses to grant permission to the innovator, the past creator may appeal to the government to enforce their intellectual property rights. Typically, intellectual property rights protect culture that is produced and sold, or made to be sold. This type of culture is &quot;commercial culture&quot;, and the focus of the law is typically on commercial creativity rather than &quot;non-commercial activity&quot;. Initially, the law, &quot;protected the incentives of creators by granting them exclusive rights to their creative work, so that they could sell those exclusive rights in a commercial marketplace.&quot; This protection has become far more extensive, as is evinced in the Armstrong/RCA example.

Lessig argues that the United States is rapidly becoming a permission culture, though he sees the internet as a modern-day Armstrong: it challenges the traditional innovator and seeks to break free of any permissions or strict regulations. The internet can provide a vastly more vibrant and competitive innovation culture, and this is troublesome for any large corporations that have invested in fortifying their intellectual property rights: &quot;Corporations threatened by the potential of the internet to change the way both commercial and noncommercial culture are made and shared have united to induce lawmakers to use the law to protect them.&quot; The internet has facilitated the mass production of culture, both commercial and noncommercial. Corporations that had traditionally controlled this production have reacted by pressuring legislators to change the laws to protect their interests. The protection that these corporations seek is not protection for the creators, but rather protection against certain forms of business that directly threaten them. Lessig&#x27;s worry is that intellectual property rights will not be protecting the right sort of property, but will instead come to protect private interests in a controlling way. He writes that the First Amendment protects creators against state control and copyright law, when properly balanced, protects creators against private control. Expansive intellectual property rights stands to dramatically increase all regulations on creativity in America, stifling innovation by requiring innovators to request permission prior to their creative work.

Free Culture covers the themes of piracy and property. Lessig writes at the end of the preface, &quot;... the free culture that I defend in this book is a balance between anarchy and control. A free culture, like a free market, is filled with property. It is filled with rules of property and contract that get enforced by the state. But just as a free market is perverted if its property becomes feudal, so too can a free culture be queered by extremism in the property rights that define it.&quot;

===Piracy===
&quot;How free is this culture?&quot;
According to Lessig, the United States has been but is decreasingly a free culture. Free cultures leave content open for expansion by others. Purportedly, this is not a new practice, but one that is increasingly challenged, mostly for economic reasons by creators and industry. The conflict or &quot;war against piracy&quot; emerges from efforts to regulate creative property in order to delimit the use of creative property without permission. As Lessig sees it, &quot;the law&#x27;s role is less and less to support creativity, and more and more to protect certain industries against competition.&quot;

This new role of law is meant to protect copyright owners from &quot;pirates&quot; who share their content for free, effectively &quot;robbing&quot; the creator of any profit. Lessig acknowledges piracy is wrong and deserving of punishment, however he is concerned the concept, as it appears in the context of &quot;internet piracy&quot;, has been used inappropriately. This problematic conception follows a certain chain of reasoning: creative work has value; when an individual uses, takes or builds upon someone else&#x27;s creative work they are appropriating something of value from the creator. If someone appropriates something of value from a creator without the creator&#x27;s expressed permission, then that someone is &quot;pirating&quot; the creator&#x27;s work, and this is wrong. Rochelle Dreyfuss, an NYU Professor of Law, has termed this conception of piracy the &quot;if value, then right&quot; theory of creative property – namely, &quot;if there is value, then someone must have a right to that value.&quot;

First defining and then pointedly critiquing a prevalent &quot;if value, then right&quot; notion of creative property, Lessig emphasizes that American law recognizes intellectual property as an instrument. Lessig points out that if &quot;if value, then right&quot; is correct, then film, recorded music, radio, and cable TV each is built on a history of piracy. Lessig details the history of these four &quot;pirates&quot; as examples of how pervasive has been the practice of making use of others&#x27; creative property without permission. Importantly, Lessig points out, throughout human history, &quot;every society has left a certain bit of its culture free for the taking.&quot; This free culture has historically been deliberate, and widely appreciated. In fact, &quot;creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now.&quot;

Lessig goes on to suggest that the advent of the Internet has changed culture, and along with it the expectation and acceptance of creative piracy. In particular, the internet has brought about a war against piracy. At the heart of the issue is a question about the reach, benefit, and burden of copyright law. The internet challenges the &quot;natural limit to the reach of the law&quot;, and therein lies the quandary. The presence of the internet instigates and fans the flames of the piracy war by virtue of its inherent ability to very quickly and indiscriminately spread content.

Lessig states that &quot;even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all &#x27;piracy&#x27; is.&quot; Finding the balance is, has been, and needs to continue to be the process of U.S. law; internet use, as exemplified by peer-to-peer file sharing, pushes the envelope.

For centuries, copyright holders have complained about &quot;piracy&quot;. In 1996, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) sued &quot;the Girl Scouts for failing to pay for the songs that girls sang around Girl Scout campfires.&quot; The suit was a public relations disaster for ASCAP, and they dropped the suit. However, the law still remains: If you sing a copyrighted song in public, you are legally required to pay the copyright holder.

Copyright law has also been extended to threaten the very creativity that is a central value of our society, burdening it &quot;with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat of obscenely severe penalties.&quot; Copyright law at its birth only protected inappropriate copying. Today it also covers

&quot;building upon or transforming that work... [W]hen the law regulates as broadly and obscurely as it does, the extension matters a lot. The burden of this law now vastly outweighs any original benefit... [T]he law&#x27;s role is less and less to support creativity, and more and more to protect certain industries against competition.&quot;

===Property===
Lessig explains that copyright is a kind of property, but that it is an odd kind of property for which the term can sometimes be misleading – the difference between taking a table and taking a good idea, for example, is hard to see under the term &#x27;property&#x27;. As late as 1774, publishers believed a copyright was forever. A copyright at that time was more limited than it is today, only prohibiting others from reprinting a book; it did not cover, as today, other rights over performance, derivative works, etc. Modern technology allows people to copy or cut and paste video clips in creative new ways to produce art, entertainment, and new modes of expression and communication that didn&#x27;t exist before. The resulting potential for media literacy could help ordinary people not only communicate their concerns better but also make it easier for them to understand when they are being suckered into things not in their interests. However, current copyright law effectively restricts the use of this to very wealthy individuals and corporations for two reasons: (1) the vagueness of &quot;fair use&quot;. (2) The costs of negotiating legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high. &quot;You either pay a lawyer to defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions so you don&#x27;t have to rely on fair use rights.&quot;

Drawing on an argument Lessig made in Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace he applies the model of four different modalities of regulation that support or weaken a given right or regulation. The four means of regulation are law, market, architecture and norms. These four modalities constrain the target group or individual in different ways, and law tends to function as an umbrella over the other methods. These constraints can be changed, also a restriction imposed by one constraint may allow freedoms from another. Lessig maintains that before the internet these constraints remained in balance with each other in regulating copying of creative works.

However, government support of established companies with an older form of doing business would preclude innovation induced competition and overall progress. Lessig says it best &#x27; it is the special duty of policy makers to guarantee that that protection not become a deterrent to progress&#x27; He specifies that his argument is not about justification of protection of copyrights but the effects of changing the law regarding copyright in the face of the internet. In this regard he brings the example of the unforeseen effects on the environment of using the chemical pesticide DDT despite its initial promise for commercial agriculture. Following this allusion he calls for an almost environmentalist awareness for the future of the creative environment.

Copyright has changed from covering just books, maps and charts to any work today that has a tangible form including music to architecture and drama and software. Today, it gives the copyright holder the exclusive right to publish the work and control over any copies of the work as well as any derivative work. Additionally, there is no requirement to register a work to get a copyright; it is automatic, whether or not a copy is made available for others to copy. Copyright law does not distinguish between transformative use of a work and duplication or piracy. The change in copyright scope today means law regulates publishers, users, and authors, simply because they are all capable of making copies. Before the internet, copies of any work were the trigger for copyright law, but Lessig raises the point of whether copies should always be the trigger, especially when considering the way digital media sharing works.

In 1831, the term of copyright increased from a maximum of 28 years to a maximum of 42; in 1909 the renewal term was extended from 14 years to 28. Beginning in 1962, the term of existing copyright was extended eleven times in the last 40 years. After 1976, any works created were subject to only one term of copyright, the maximum term, which was the life of the author plus fifty years, or seventy five years for corporations. According to Lessig, the public domain becomes orphaned by these changes to copyright law. In the past thirty years the average term has tripled and has gone from about 33 years to 95.

There are uses of copyrighted material that may involve copying that do not invoke copyright law; these are deemed fair uses. Fair use law denies the owner any exclusive right over such fair uses for public policy. The internet shifts the use of digital creative property, to one that is now regulated under copyright law. There is almost no use that is presumptively unregulated.

Relatively recent changes in technology and copyright law have dramatically expanded the impact of copyright in five different dimensions:

*The duration increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 (for copyrights owned by corporations) between 1974 and 2004, and it may yet be extended further, in violation of the constitutional requirement that the exclusive rights be &quot;for limited times&quot;.
*The scope has increased from regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone.
*The reach has expanded, because computers make copies with every view, and these copies are presumptively regulated.
*The control the copyright holder has over use has expanded dramatically, using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to prosecute people with software that could defeat the limits built into the code used to distribute the product. The latter may limit how many times a person can view the material, whether copy and paste is allowed, whether and how much can be printed, and whether the copy can be loaned or given to anyone else.
*Increases in the concentration and integration [of] media ownership provides unprecedented control over political discourse and the evolution of culture. &quot;[F]ive companies control 85 percent of our media sources... [F]our companies control 90 percent of the nation&#x27;s radio advertising revenues... [T]en companies control half of the nation&#x27;s [newspapers]... [T]en film studios receive 99 percent of all film revenue. The ten largest cable companies account for 85 percent of all cable revenue.&quot;

Lessig argues that some of these changes benefited society as a whole. However, the combined effects of the changes in these five dimensions has been to restrict, rather than promote, the progress of science and useful arts, in apparent violation of the constitutional justification for copyright law. The negative impact on creativity can be seen in numerous examples throughout this book. An example of its impact on political discourse is the refusal by the major TV networks to run ads critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s claims of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction during the period prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, enforced by Supreme Court decisions that give stations the right to choose what they will and will not run. Lessig claims this kind of environment is not democratic, and at no point in our history have people had fewer &quot;legal right[s] to control more of the development of our culture than now.&quot;

== Outline ==
The following summarizes the different sections of the book.

=== Preface ===
Lessig insists that the future of society is being threatened by recent changes in US law and administration, including decisions by the US Federal Communications Commission that allow increased Concentration of media ownership. Lessig claims to defend a free culture that is balanced between control – a culture that has property, rules, and contracts pertaining to property that are enforced by the state — and anarchy — a culture that can grow and thrive when others are allowed to use and build upon the property of others. However, this culture can become puzzling and perplexing when the extremism about property rights begins to mimic the feudal property of a free market.

=== Introduction ===
Lessig provides two examples that portray the difference between a free culture and a permissions culture — two themes that will develop throughout the book. &quot;(See Introduction and Identification of cultural Shift)&quot;

==== Chapter 1. Creators ====
Lessig devotes the first chapter to defining creators as &#x27;copycats&#x27; who borrow and &quot;build upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now... partially done without permission and without compensating the original creator.&quot; Throughout the chapter Lessig develops on a theme that &quot;all cultures are free to some degree,&quot; by expounding on key examples from the American and Japanese cultures, namely Disney and doujinshi comics, respectively.

The first commercial success of Mickey Mouse came with &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, released in 1928. In part, it parodied the silent film &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot;, released earlier that year by Buster Keaton. Under current US law, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; might be challenged for copyright violation as a &quot;derivative work&quot; of &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; However, under copyright laws in 1928, this type of cultural production was unproblematic. This change has had a chilling effect on creativity, serving to reduce competition to the established media companies, as suggested by the subtitle to the original hardback edition of &quot;Free Culture&quot;.

Similarly, in the vigorous Japanese comic market, where &quot;Some 40 percent of publications are comics, and 30 percent of publication revenue derives from comics&quot;, one main driving force is &#x27;doujinshi&#x27;, which is a kind of copycat technique. However, to qualify as doujinshi, &quot;the artist must make a contribution to the art he copies... Doujinshi are plainly &#x27;derivative works.&#x27;&quot; The doujinshi artists almost never get the permission of those who own the works they modify, though their work is seen to contribute to the overall cultural production.

This illegal, though culturally significant, market flourishes in Japan because it helps the mainstream comic creators. The mainstream market flourishes as well despite the derivative doujinshi market. Fighting this burgeoning illegal market would spell trouble for the mainstream market as well; these two systems for creating have learned to live somewhat harmoniously with one another, to each other&#x27;s benefit.

Lessig concludes with a thought that &quot;ours was a free culture [that] is becoming much less so.&quot; So, would the US have a more vibrant industry in creating comics if the law were not used as often here to punish and intimidate small competitors to the big business producing comics?

==== Chapter 2. &quot;Mere Copyists&quot; ====
Chapter 2 is a discussion about the influence of technology on culture, and the legal environment that impacts its reach. Lessig recounts George Eastman&#x27;s invention of Kodak as a technology that advanced the invention of photography, and brought about significant social change by giving the average citizen access to what began as an elite form of expression. Lessig traces the simultaneous legal environment that permitted its genius: Given the challenge of deciding whether photographers would need to get permission before taking aim, the legal system decided &quot;in favor of the pirates... Freedom was the default.&quot;

Lessig presses to suggest that, had the legal atmosphere been different, &quot;nothing like the growth in a democratic technology of expression would have been realized.&quot; Democracy of expression is a main theme for this chapter, as Lessig examines various examples of the technologies that are developed to promote so-called &quot;media literacy&quot;, the understanding and active use of media for learning, living, and communicating in the twenty-first century; he describes media literacy as a tool for empowering minds and reversing the digital divide.

The Internet is introduced as a prime example of a technology that develops the culture. For Lessig, the Internet is a &quot;mix of captured images, sound, and commentary [that] can be widely spread practically instantaneously.&quot; With e-mail and blogging, the Internet creates a dimension for democracy of speech that is widespread and far-reaching. Lessig&#x27;s lament is that the freedom that the Internet and similar technologies offer is increasingly challenged by the restrictions that are placed upon them through laws that &quot;close down that technology.&quot;

==== Chapter 3. Catalogs ====
In chapter 3, Lessing shares an account of Jesse Jordan, a 2002 freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) who made a significant contribution to the free culture debate through tinkering to develop a search engine which indexed pictures, research, notes, movie clips and a variety of other RPI network materials. When the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued Jesse (and three other students) for piracy, forcing him into a settlement that cost him all of his $12,000 savings, Jesse became an activist for free culture.

==== Chapter 4. &quot;Pirates&quot; ====
In chapter 4 Lessig advises that &quot;the history of the content industry is a history of piracy. Every important sector of the &#x27;big media&#x27; today — film, records, radio, and cable TV — was born of a kind of piracy so defined.&quot; This includes the film industry of Hollywood who used piracy in order to escape the controls of Thomas Edison&#x27;s patents. Similarly, the record industry grew out of piracy due to a loophole in the law permitting composers exclusivity to copies of their music and its public performance, but not over reproduction via the new phonograph and player piano technologies. Radio also grew out of piracy since the radio industry is not required to compensate recording artists for playing their works. As such, &quot;the law gives the radio station the right to take something for nothing,&quot; though radio is required to pay the composer. Cable TV is yet another example of big media that grew out of piracy. For decades, cable companies were not required to pay for their broadcast content. As in the case with recorded music, law ultimately settled this score by setting a price at which cable companies would pay copyright holders for their content.

According to Lessig, &quot;every industry affected by copyright today is the product and beneficiary of a certain kind of piracy... Every generation welcomes the pirates from the last... until now.&quot;

==== Chapter 5. &quot;Piracy&quot; ====
Lessig contextualizes piracy, noting that &quot;even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all &#x27;piracy&#x27; is... Many kinds of &#x27;piracy&#x27; are useful and productive... Neither our tradition nor any tradition has ever banned all &#x27;piracy&#x27;.&quot;

Lessig compares the examples of piracy that were previously treated:

Bringing the discussion to an up-to-date example, Lessig gives an overview of Napster peer-to-peer (p2p) sharing and outlines benefits and harms of this kind of piracy through sharing. He cautions that laws should be tempered according to how much benefit and how harm such sharing might cause. According to Lessig, &quot;[t]he question is a matter of balance. The law should seek that balance...&quot;

Lessig emphasizes the role of copyright law, pointing out that as it stands, copyright law impacts all kinds of piracy, and hence is a part of the piracy war that challenges free culture. On the one hand, copyright supporters indiscriminately recognize cultural content as sharing the same attributes as tangible property. On the other hand, creators shun the notion of having their intellectual property at the disposal of pirates, and so agree to delimit commonality through strict copyright laws. Ultimately, Lessig calls for changes in US copyright law that balance the support of intellectual property with cultural freedom.

=== &quot;Property&quot; ===
A copyright is an odd kind of property, because it limits free use of ideas and expression. Chapters 6–9 
offer four stories to help illustrate what it means to say that a copyright is property.

==== Chapter 6. Founders ====
In the majority of European countries, copyright law began with the efforts of spiritual and temporal authorities to control the production of printers. This was often done by granting monopolies. &quot;Henry VIII granted a patent to print the bible&quot;. In England, the Crown&#x27;s practice of handing out monopolies became quite unpopular and was one of the issues that motivated the English Civil War of 1642–1651.

As late as 1774, publishers believed a copyright was forever. This was in spite of the fact that &quot;[t]he Statute of Anne [of 1710 tried to limit this by declaring] that all published works would get a copyright term of fourteen years, renewable once if the author was alive, and that all works already published... would get a single term of twenty-one additional years.&quot; (A copyright at that time was more limited than it is today, only prohibiting others from reprinting a book; it did not cover, as today, other rights over performance, derivative works, etc.) In spite of the Statute of Anne, publishers still insisted they had a perpetual copyright under common law. This claim was controversial. &quot;Many believed the power the [publishers] exercised over the spread of knowledge was harming that spread&quot;. In 1774 the House of Lords, functioning like the Supreme Court of the United States today determined that in granting a copyright, &quot;The state would protect the exclusive right [to publish], but only so long as it benefited society.&quot; &quot;After 1774, the public domain was born.&quot;

==== Chapter 7. Recorders ====
A film made by Jon Else in 1990 includes a 4.5 second segment with a television in a corner playing &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Before releasing the film, Else contacted &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27;s creator, Matt Groening for copyright permission. Groening agreed but asked Else to contact the producer, Gracie Films. They agreed but asked Else to contact their parent company, Fox. When he contacted Fox, someone there claimed that Groening didn&#x27;t own &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and Fox wanted $10,000 to allow him to distribute his documentary with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; playing in the background of a 4.5 second scene about something else. &quot;Else was sure there was a mistake. He worked his way up to someone he thought was a vice president for licensing, Rebecca Herrera. She confirmed that copyright permission would cost $10,000 for that 4.5 second clip in the corner of a shot, and added, &quot;And if you quote me, I&#x27;ll turn you over to our attorneys.&quot;

==== Chapter 8. Transformers ====
In 1993, Starwave, Inc., produced a retrospective on compact disc (CD-ROM) of the career of Clint Eastwood, who had made over 50 films as an actor and director. The retrospective included short excerpts from each of Eastwood&#x27;s films. Because this was not obviously &quot;fair use&quot;, they needed to get clear rights from anyone who might have a copyright claim to those film clips, actors, composers, musicians, etc. CD was a new technology, not mentioned in any of the original contracts with the people involved. The standard rate at that time for that kind of use of less than a minute of film was about $600. A year later, they had collected signatures from everyone they could identify in the clips they had chosen, &quot;and even then we weren&#x27;t sure whether we were totally in the clear.&quot;

Similarly, in &quot;2003, DreamWorks Studios announced an agreement with Mike Myers and Austin Powers [to] acquire the rights to existing motion picture hits and classics, write new story-lines and — with the use of state-of-the-art digital technology — insert Myers and other actors into the film, thereby creating an entirely new piece of entertainment.&quot;

These two examples expose a major threat to the creativity of our society: Modern technology allows people to copy or cut and paste video clips in creative new ways to produce art, entertainment, and new modes of expression and communication that didn&#x27;t exist before. The resulting potential for media literacy could help ordinary people not only communicate their concerns better but also make it easier for them to understand when they are being suckered into things not in their interests (as indicated in chapter 2 of this book). However, current copyright law effectively restricts the use of this to very wealthy individuals and corporations for two reasons: (1) the vagueness of &quot;fair use&quot;. (2) The costs of negotiating legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high. &quot;You either pay a lawyer to defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions so you don&#x27;t have to rely on fair use rights.&quot;

==== Chapter 9. Collectors ====
Lessig complained, &quot;While much of twentieth-century culture was constructed through television, only a tiny portion of that culture is available for anyone to see today.&quot; Lessig suggests that this is a violation of the spirit of the letter of the constitution: Early American copyright law required copyright owners to deposit copies of their work in libraries. &quot;These copies were intended both to facilitate the spread of knowledge and to assure that a copy of the work would be around once the copyright expired&quot;.

However, starting with film in 1915 the government has allowed copyright holders to avoid depositing a copy permanently with the Library of Congress. As a result, most of the copyrighted material from the twentieth century is unavailable to the public in any form.

This is starting to change. In 1996 Brewster Kahle founded the Internet Archive, a non-profit digital library to provide &quot;universal access to all knowledge&quot;.

However, congress continues to extend the copyright period. In 1790, a copyright lasted 14 years, and owners could get a 14-year extension for a fee. Since then, the copyright period was extended in 1831, 1909, 1954, 1971, 1976, 1988, 1992, 1994, and 1998. The media industry that got the previous extensions can be expected to try for yet another extension.

==== Chapter 10. &quot;Property&quot; ====
Chapter 10 examines the relatively recent changes in technology and copyright law have dramatically expanded the impact of copyright in five different dimensions: Duration, Scope, Reach, Control, Concentration.

=== Puzzles ===

==== Chapter 11. Chimera ====
A chimera is an animal (e.g., human) with double the standard DNA formed by the fusion of two embryos. Chimeras were discovered when genetic testing of mothers failed to match the DNA of a child. Further testing revealed that the chimeric mothers had two sets of DNA.

 [In] &quot;the copyright wars,&quot;... we&#x27;re dealing with a chimera... [I]n the battle over... &quot;What is p2p sharing?&quot; both sides have it right, and both sides have it wrong. One side says, &quot;File sharing is just like two kids taping each other&#x27;s records...&quot; That&#x27;s true, at least in part... But the description is also false in part... [M]y p2p network [gives anyone] access to my music... [I]t stretches the meaning of &quot;friends&quot; beyond recognition to say &quot;my ten thousand best friends&quot;.

The section then goes on to describe how, according to the RIAA, downloading a CD could leave you liable for damages of one and a half million dollars. Lessig then suggests that content owners are gaining a level of control they never previously had.

==== Chapter 12. Harms ====
In this chapter Lessig describes three consequences of what he terms a &quot;war&quot;. This war has been launched by the content industry to protect &quot;property&quot;.

Constraining Creators: This section explores how the current law makes the use of new digital technologies, such as e-mailing a Comedy Central clips, &quot;presumptively illegal&quot;. He goes on to describe how it is impossible to determine where the line between legal and illegal lies but that the consequences of crossing the line can be extreme, such in the case of four college students threatened with a $98 billion lawsuit by RIAA. He states &quot;[F]air use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer...&quot;

Constraining Innovators: In this section Lessig describes how innovators are being constrained, and amongst the examples he uses he gives the company MP3.com. In 2000 this company launched a service that would allow users to have a &quot;lockbox&quot; to which they could upload their music and access it anywhere. Shortly after the service was launched several major record companies sued the company and judgement was later entered for Vivendi against MP3.com. A year later Vivendi bought MP3.com. He also describes how innovators are hampered both the uncertainty in the law and the content industry&#x27;s attempt to use to law to regulate the internet in an attempt to protect their interests. Also in this section he describes how, when new technologies are invented, Congress has attempted to strike a balance so as to protect these new technologies from the older ones. He suggests that this balance has now changed and uses as an example Internet radio which he suggests has been burdened by regulations and royalty payments that broadcasters have not been.

Corrupting Citizens: Here Lessig describes how, according to the New York Times 43 million Americans had downloaded music in 2002, thus making 20 percent of Americans criminals.

=== Balances ===
==== Chapter 13. Eldred ====
This chapter summarizes &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;. The lead petitioner, Eric Eldred, wanted to make public domain works freely available on the Internet. He was particularly interested in a work that was slated to pass into the public domain in 1998. However, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) meant that this work would not be in the public domain until 2019 – and not even then if Congress extended the term again, as it had eleven times since 1962. Further extension seems likely, because it makes good business sense for organizations owning old works that still generate revenue to spend a portion of that money on campaign contributions and lobbying to extend the terms even further. &quot;Copyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be bought to extend them again.

Lead counsel in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot; was Lessig. He lost this case due, he says, to a strategic blunder in arguing that repeated extensions effectively granted perpetual copyright in violation of the constitutional specification that copyrights and patents be &quot;for limited times&quot;.

This was a high-profile case, and many different groups had filed briefs. &quot;[T]he Nashville Songwriters Association wrote that the public domain was nothing more than &#x27;legal piracy.&#x27;&quot; One brief &quot;was signed by seventeen economists, including five Nobel Prize winners.&quot;

Lessig believes that if he had instead argued that this extension caused net harm to the US economy and culture, as numerous people had advised, he could have won. Lessig insists that, &quot;The real harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially exploited, and no longer available as a result.&quot;

The structure of current law makes it exceedingly difficult for someone who might want to do something with an old work to find the copyright owner, because no central list exists. Because these old works no longer seem commercially viable to the copyright holder, many are deteriorating. Many old &quot;films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and nitrate stock dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal canisters in which they are now stored will be filled with nothing more
than dust.&quot;

==== Chapter 14. Eldred II ====

=== Conclusion ===
In conclusion, Lessig uses the disproportionate number of HIV and AIDS victims in Africa and other poor countries to further his argument that the current control of intellectual property—in this case, patents to HIV drugs—defy &quot;common sense.&quot; AIDS is no longer a mortal illness for individuals who can afford between $10,000 and $15,000 per year, but few in poor countries can afford this. Lessig cites drug company lobbying in the U.S. to prevent reduced prices for their drugs in Africa, but he holds the government and society responsible for failing to &quot;revolt&quot; against this injustice. In 1997 the US government threatened South Africa with possible trade sanctions if it attempted to obtain the drugs at the price at which they were available in these few other poor countries. In response, Lessig calls for a &quot;sensible patent policy&quot; that could support the patent system but enable flexibility in distribution, a &quot;sense of balance&quot; he says once existed historically but has now been lost. He supports the rights of companies to charge whatever they want for innovative products, but says we need patents to encourage others to invest in the research needed to develop such products. He points out, however, that offering AIDS drugs at a much reduced price in Africa would not directly impact the profits of pharmaceutical companies.

=== Afterword ===
In the afterword, Lessig proposes practical solutions to the dispute over intellectual property rights, in hope that common sense and a proclivity toward free culture be revived. His ideas include emulating the structure of the Creative Commons in complement to copyright; invoking more formalities for in the exercise of creativity online (marking copyrighted work, registering copyrights, and renewing claims to copyright); limiting the role of the Copyright Office in developing marking systems; shorter copyright terms (enough to incentivize creativity, but no more) and simpler language; and moving the concerns of copyright out of the purview of expensive lawyers and more into public sphere.

The balance of this book maps out what might be done about the problems described earlier. This is divided into two parts: what anyone can do now and what requires help from lawmakers.

Us, Now: If current trends continue, &#x27;cut and paste&#x27; will become &#x27;get permission to cut and paste&#x27;.

Them, Soon: This chapter outlines five kinds of changes in law suggested by the analysis of this book.

&quot;1. More Formalities&quot;: It is suggested that all copyright work should be registered so as to lower the costs involved in obtaining the rights to a work. He further suggests that until a work has a complainant copyright notice the work should be usable by anyone.

&quot;2. Shorter Terms&quot; In this section it is proposed that copyright terms should be shorter. Although not suggesting an actual time Lessig does suggest four principles of any copyright term:
:&quot;It should be (1) short, (2) simple, (3) alive (i.e., require a renewal), and (4) prospective (i.e., do not authorize retrospective extension).&quot;

&quot;3. Free Use Vs. Fair Use&quot;: Lessig suggests that what constitutes a derivative work should be narrowed.

&quot;4. Liberate the Music —Again&quot;: Here Lessig argues that the law on file-sharing music should be reformed and that any reform that attempts to limit file sharing in lieu of purchasing must also ensure it does not hamper the sharing of free content. He also suggests a law should be developed that allows the sharing of music no longer available in other media but ensure artists still receive a small royalty.

&quot;5. Fire Lots of Lawyers&quot;: Lessig opines that the costs involved in the legal system are too high and that it only works effectively for the top 1% and that a cheaper system would be more just.

==Critical reception==

=== In news media ===
In a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Adam Cohen found &quot;Free Culture&quot; to be a &quot;powerfully argued and important analysis,&quot; where Lessig argues persuasively that we are in a crisis of cultural impoverishment. However, he says that &quot;after taking us to this point, 300 pages into his analysis,&quot; Lessig &quot;fails to deliver,&quot; and his proposals are both &quot;impractical and politically unattainable.&quot;

David Post in &quot;Reason&quot; argued that Lessig shows that &quot;free culture&quot; has always been a part of our intellectual heritage and illuminates the tension between the already created and not yet created. Although Post generally agrees with Lessig&#x27;s argument, he does point out that copyrights are property rights, arguing &quot;property rights are, as a general rule, a good thing&quot; and that Lessig does not do enough in his book to address this side of the debate.

=== In academia ===
Stuart Weinstein and Charles Wild reviewed the book for the &quot;International Review of Law Computers &amp; Technology&quot;. They wrote that Lessig&#x27;s claim that &quot;the Internet and intellectual property law are being used by powerful media forces as a tool for suppressing creativity in the pursuit of pure economic benefit&quot; is too bleak and perhaps exaggerated when it comes to the present situation, but they agreed that the trends he illustrates are real and can become increasingly problematic in the future.

Peter Decherney reviewed the book for &quot;The Moving Image: The Journal of the Association of Moving Image Archivists&quot;. He declared it &quot;an important book for many reaadership&quot;: artists, policymakers, college students, but most importantly, film historians and archivists. He found Lessig&#x27;s argument generally convincing, although perhaps a bit too pessimistic. Decherney wrote that while historically the law is slow to change, it nonetheless does change, and thanks to Lessig&#x27;s commendable activism for bringing the problems with the copyright law before the public, the change may be swifter and more positive then in the past.

Michael O&#x27;Hare in his review for the &quot;Journal of Cultural Economics&quot; noted that that while the book has a few minor flaws (for example, the ebook version reviewed was a poorly formatted PDF with no hyperlinks), the work is an &quot;extremely thoughtful and well-informed&quot; analysis of modern state of culture and the law. For the &quot;most distinctive contribution of the book&quot;, he singled out the argument that technology can take content or activities that were historically free (such as reading or lending) and make them subject to unfair control by the provider of new  mediums or services, therefore reducing our freedom to act.

Frederick Pinto reviewed the book for the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot;. He states that the book&#x27;s &quot;main strengths lie in its empirical richness and in Lessig&#x27;s mastery at placing current legal developments in a wide historical context&quot;. He concludes that while Lessig&#x27;s may be suffering from a &quot;tunnel vision&quot;, the book &quot;retains enough objectivity and academic rigor to make it an interesting and important read in this debate&quot;.

Julia D. Mahoney in the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot; was more critical. She found Lessig&#x27;s arguments not convincing, as according to her, our current world &quot;is a vibrant place where technological innovation, creative endeavors, and public discussion of political issues flourish&quot;, and Lessig exaggerates the scope of the problems faced, and fails to present reasonable solutions to the issues he describes.

Lawrence B. Solum reviewed the book for &quot;Texas Law Review&quot;. He wrote that Lessig&#x27;s work is a sophisticated work, but it is should not be seen as academic book, but rather one addressed to the general audience, as next to &quot;deeply illuminating&quot; arguments it also contains emotional &quot;cheap shots&quot; and simplifies some arguments into a black versus white situation. The book, he writes, successfully asserts: &quot;how an excess of intellectual property can lead to results that seem silly, pernicious or wrong&quot;, how &quot;our legal traditions actually sanction unauthorized copying&quot;, and how &quot;the social forces that are pushing for further expansion of copyright, the big media companies, are the bad guys&quot;. He notes, however, that &quot;what Lessig opposes is clear, but why and what he favors instead are much murkier&quot;. In the end, he concludes, the book, while obviously written to advance a particular point of view, is &quot;a model of restraint&quot;, presenting &quot;an account that, while opinionated, is nuanced, fair, and balanced&quot; and calling the result &quot;intelligent, entertaining and moving&quot;.

== Derivative works ==

A day after the book was released online, blogger AKMA (A. K. Adam) suggested that people pick a chapter and make a voice recording of it, partly because they were allowed to. Users who commented volunteered to narrate certain chapters. Two days later, most of the book had been narrated.

Besides audio production, this book was also translated into Chinese, a project proposed by Isaac Mao and completed as a collaboration involving many bloggers from mainland China and Taiwan. Other translations include Catalan, Czech, French, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.

<text>Percy Shaw, (15 April 1890 – 1 September 1976) was an English inventor and businessman. He patented the reflective road stud or &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; in 1934, and set up a company to manufacture his invention in 1935.
==Biography==
Percy Shaw was born in Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the fourth child and second son of James Shaw, a dyehouse labourer who worked at a local mill, and his second wife Esther Hannah Morrell. Shaw&#x27;s father also had seven children by his first wife, Jane Brearley, who died in 1883. In 1892, his parents moved their large family to Boothtown in Halifax, where Shaw lived for the rest of his life.

Shaw was educated at Boothtown Board School, and started work as a labourer in a cloth mill at the age of 13. He became apprenticed to a wire drawer, but the low wages on offer were not attractive and he soon took a series of unskilled jobs in local engineering works. He was thus well placed to join his father in a new business repairing small machine tools used in munitions production during the First World War. After his father&#x27;s death in 1929, he started his own small business as a road contractor, repairing roads until his death in the 1970s. He received an OBE in 1965.

==Invention==

Shaw was inventive, even at an early age, but his most famous invention was the cat&#x27;s eye for lighting the way along roads in the dark. There are several stories about how he came up with the idea. The most famous involves his driving down the difficult road (Queensbury Road, part of the A647 with a very steep drop to one side) from the Old Dolphin public house in Clayton Heights to his home in Halifax, when a cat on a fence along the edge of the road looked at the car and reflected his headlights back to him, allowing him to take corrective action and remain on the road. In an interview with Alan Whicker, however, he told a different story of being inspired on a foggy night to think of a way of moving the reflective studs on a road sign to the road surface. Further, local schoolchildren who were taken on visits to the factory in the late 1970s were told that the idea came from Shaw seeing light reflected from his car headlamps by tram tracks in the road on a foggy night. The tram tracks were polished by the passing of trams and by following the advancing reflection, it was possible to maintain the correct position in the road.

In 1934, he patented his invention (patents Nos. 436,290 and 457,536), based on the 1927 retroreflecting lens patent of Richard Hollins Murray. A year later, Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd was formed to manufacture the devices. Sales were initially slow, but approval from the Ministry of Transport and the blackout in the Second World War gave a huge boost to production and the firm, located near Shaw&#x27;s home in Boothtown, grew in size making more than a million roadstuds a year, which were exported all over the world. A later patent added a rainwater reservoir to the rubber shoe, which could be used to wash the glass &quot;eyes&quot; when a car drove over the stud. Such a success was the invention of the &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; that he was rewarded with an OBE for services to exports in the birthday honours list in 1965.

He became eccentric in later life, removing the carpets, curtains and much of the furniture from his isolated home, and keeping four televisions running constantly (respectively tuned to BBC1, BBC2 and ITV with a fourth showing BBC2 in colour, all with the sound turned down). On each Friday a few friends would come to the house and Percy would supply crates of bottled ale and boxes of potato crisps. He told Alan Whicker that the reason for keeping the TVs on simultaneously was so that his friends could watch whichever of the then existing channels they chose to, and there would be no arguments. His one luxury was his Rolls-Royce Phantom. He never married and he died from cancer and heart disease at Boothtown Mansion, Halifax, where he had lived for all but two of his 86 years. Despite rumours of a personal fortune, his personal estate was admitted to probate in December 1976 at a value of £193,500. He was an agnostic, but his funeral was held at Boothtown Methodist Church, and he was cremated in Elland.

In 2005, he was listed as one of the 50 greatest Yorkshire people in a book by Bernard Ingham.

==Commemoration==
A pub in Broad Street, Halifax, is named for Shaw. A blue plaque was erected by the Halifax Civic Trust. The University of Huddersfield renamed the Queen Street Studios building &#x27;Percy Shaw House&#x27; in honour of Shaw.

<doc id="553679" wikidata="Q2101191" url="?curid=553679" title="Poling (metallurgy)">
<text>A metallurgical method employed in the purification of copper which contains copper oxide as an impurity and also in the purification of tin which contains tin oxide (stannic oxide or &quot;SnO2&quot;) as an impurity. The impure metal, usually in the form of molten blister copper, is placed in an anode furnace for two stages of refining. In the first stage, sulphur and iron are removed by gently blowing air through the molten metal to form iron oxides and sulfur dioxide. The iron oxides are skimmed or poured off the top of the copper and the gaseous sulfur dioxide exits the furnace via the off-gas system. Once the first &quot;oxidation&quot; stage is complete, the second stage (&quot;reduction&quot; or &quot;poling&quot;) begins. This involves using a reducing agent, normally natural gas or diesel (but ammonia, liquid petroleum gas, and naphtha can also be used), to react with the oxygen in the copper oxide to form copper . In the past, freshly cut (&quot;green&quot;) trees were used as wooden poles. The sap in these poles acted as the reducing agent. The heat of the copper makes the pole emit wood gas(CO2 and H2) that reduces the cuprous oxide to copper.

It was the use of these greenwood poles gave rise to the term &quot;poling.&quot;

Care must be taken to avoid removing too much of the oxygen from the anode copper, as this will cause other impurities to change from their oxide to metallic states and they will remain in solid solution in the copper, reduce its conductivity and change its physical properties. Also upper surface can be covered with coke to prevent reoxidation of metal.

<text>This is a list of school divisions in Saskatchewan.

There are currently twenty-seven school divisions: eighteen public divisions, eight Roman Catholic Separate School Divisions, and one fransaskois school division.

When Saskatchewan was created in 1905, there were over five thousand school districts in Saskatchewan operating one room school houses. In the 1940s, the provincial government instituted an amalgamation process resulting in larger school units, which greatly reduced the number of school divisions. In 2004, the government announced a further amalgamation process. Seventy-one school divisions were amalgamated into twelve new school divisions and two re-structured school divisions, while thirteen other school divisions were not affected.

<text>Abdiel ( &quot;Servant of El&quot;) is a biblical name which has been used as the name for a number of notable people. The name has the same meaning as Obadiah and is cognate with the Arabic name Abdullah. Abdiel is mentioned a single time in the Bible, in : &quot;Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.&quot;

==People==
Notable people with the name include:

* Abdiel Arroyo (born 1993), Panamanian footballer
* Abdiel Ayarza (born 1992), Panamanian footballer
* Abdiel Colberg (born 1957), Puerto Rican film director and television producer
* Abdiel Crossman (1804–1859), mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1846 to 1854
* Abdiel Vázquez (born 1984), Mexican pianist
* Abdiel Villa (born 1983), Mexican footballer
* Aperel (fl. c. 1350s BCE), ancient Egyptian courtier and administrator

==Other uses==
===Paradise Lost===
Chief among characters bearing the name Abdiel is the seraph Abdiel appearing in Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667), specifically in and . Two passages from Book V serve to establish Abdiel&#x27;s character:

Abdiel denounces Satan after hearing him incite revolt among the angels, and abandons Lucifer to bring the news of his defection to God. However, when he arrives, he finds that preparations are already underway for battle. In the ensuing fight, Abdiel smites Satan, Ariel, Ramiel, and Arioch, presumably among others. In &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Annotated Paradise Lost&quot;, Isaac Asimov theorized that Abdiel was in fact a representation of Milton himself. Likewise, in &quot;Cyder&quot;, Ambrose Philips refers to Milton as &quot;that other bard&quot; and contrasts Milton to his character Abdiel.

===Other uses===
The character name &quot;Abdiel&quot; has also been used:
* by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle in &quot;Many Waters&quot; as one among the seraphim
* by Margaret Weis in the &quot;Star of the Guardians&quot; trilogy as a villain
* by Anatole France in &quot;The Revolt of the Angels&quot; as the &quot;angelic name&quot; of the character Arcade, the guardian angel bent on causing the revolt that gives the novel its title
* by Steven Brust in &quot;To Reign in Hell&quot; as the ambitious angel who catalyzes the dispute between Yaweh and Satan which would eventually result in the revolt in Heaven
* by Kage Baker in &quot;The Graveyard Game&quot; as an immortal who maintains certain secret machinery
* As a major character in Shin Megami Tensei V, as an archangel who is the main representative of the game&#x27;s law route

<text>A drug holiday (sometimes also called a drug vacation, medication vacation, structured treatment interruption, tolerance break, treatment break or strategic treatment interruption) is when a patient stops taking a medication(s) for a period of time; anywhere from a few days to many months or even years if the doctor or medical provider feels it is best for the patient. It is recommended not to discontinue any medication without the close supervision of the prescribing party.

Planned drug holidays are used in numerous fields of medicine. They are perhaps best known in HIV therapy, after a study showed that stopping medication may stimulate the immune system to attack the virus.
Another reason for drug holidays is to permit a drug to regain effectiveness after a period of continuous use, and to reduce the tolerance effect that may require increased dosages. 

In addition to drug holidays that are intended for therapeutic effect, they are sometimes used to reduce drug side effects so that patients may enjoy a more normal life for a period of time such as a weekend or holiday, or engage in a particular activity. For example, it is common for patients using SSRI anti-depressant therapies to take a drug holiday to reduce or avoid side effects associated with sexual dysfunction.

In the treatment of mental illness, a drug holiday may be part of a progression toward treatment cessation. The holiday is also a tool to assess a drug&#x27;s benefits against unwanted side effects, assuming that both will dissipate after an extended vacation.

==Evolution of the practice==
===As a treatment for bipolar disorder===

One-day drug holidays in the lithium treatment of bipolar disorder, known as &quot;lithium-free days&quot;, have been in use since the pioneering work of Noack and Trautner in 1951. This was found to reduce toxic buildup of the drug in some patients.

===As a treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease===

Drug holidays from L-dopa found use in the early 1970s when Sweet et al. reported they were beneficial in terms of restoring the effectiveness of the treatment after adaptation by the brain had diminished its effectiveness.
However, later studies revealed that such drug holidays conferred only temporary benefits to L-dopa responsiveness. Furthermore, there was an increased risk of death from associated complications, namely aspiration pneumonia, depression, and thromboembolic disease. L-dopa drug holidays are thus no longer recommended.

===As a treatment for schizophrenia===

Drug holidays from antipsychotic medication such as chlorpromazine have been used since the early 1980s to alleviate adverse reactions associated with long-term treatment.

According to Ann Mortimer, it is acknowledged that established guidelines require long-term treatment in established schizophrenia, because the vast majority of evidence from discontinuation, &quot;drug holiday&quot;, and ultra-low-dose studies conducted over many years points to significantly higher relapse rates when compared to maintenance treatment. If antipsychotics cannot be avoided in the near term, there is no reason to question their long-term usefulness. The same might be said of insulin in diabetes.

===As a treatment for HIV===
HIV selectively targets activated helper T-cells. Thus, over time, HIV will tend to selectively destroy those helper T-cells most capable of fighting the HIV infection off, effectively desensitizing the immune system to the infection. The purpose of a structured treatment interruption is to create a short interval in which the virus becomes common enough to stimulate reproduction of T-cells capable of fighting the virus.

A 2006 HIV literature review noted that &quot;two studies suggested that so-called drug holidays were of no benefit and might actually harm patients, while a third study suggested that the idea might still have value and should be revisited.&quot;

<text>Linda Cobb (born c. 1950) is an American writer and columnist who is known as the &quot;Queen of Clean&quot;. She is known for humor in her writing which focuses on difficult cleaning problems and cleaning solutions which are used everyday or inexpensive items like tea bags and Tang. She is also a featured guest on radio and television shows in the United States.

== Biography ==
Cobb was raised in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. When she was young, she wanted to be a chemical engineer, but didn&#x27;t feel there were many opportunities for women in that occupation.

Cobb met her first husband, Bruce Dusette, in 1967. They later moved to Marysville and in 1981, her husband was diagnosed with leukemia and shortly after, Cobb gave birth to their stillborn baby. In 1982, she began to work at a large cleaning company, Moretz Cleaning. She also had a foster child, David, come to live with her in the same year. While she worked at the cleaning company, she learned many tricks and tips on how to clean almost anything. Many of the jobs her company specialized in included smoke and water damage. In 1991, she bought out the Moretz Cleaning company.

In 1994, she married John Cobb and moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1995. Cobb felt that there was a gap in housecleaning information being passed from one generation to the next. At the suggestion of a friend, she began a newsletter focusing on cleaning tips which led to her appearances on Arizona television and radio. She began to make regular appearances on the television show, &quot;Good Morning Arizona.&quot; In her first appearance on &quot;Good Morning Arizona&quot; in 1997, she started her segment with the double entendre, &quot;I&#x27;m the Queen of Clean and we&#x27;re going to talk dirty today.&quot; Her segment on the show led to a Phoenix publisher offering her a book deal.

Cobb made national attention in the United States through the release of her first book, &quot;Talking Dirty With the Queen of Clean&quot;. This book was a bestseller in 2000 and two other books, &quot;Talking Dirty Laundry With the Queen of Clean&quot; and &quot;A Queen For All Seasons&quot;, were also on the New York Times Best Seller List. &quot;Talking Dirty&quot; also made the number one spot on the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; List during October, 2000. In 2002, she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Her editor, Brenda Copeland, says that Cobb&#x27;s success is due to her personality which adds a twist of fun to the &quot;drudgery&quot; of cleaning.

<doc id="553694" wikidata="Q597832" url="?curid=553694" title="Charles Comiskey">
<text>Charles Albert Comiskey (August 15, 1859 – October 26, 1931), nicknamed &quot;Commy&quot; or &quot;the Old Roman&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball player, manager and team owner. He was a key person in the formation of the American League, and was also founding owner of the Chicago White Sox. Comiskey Park, the White Sox&#x27;s storied baseball stadium, was built under his guidance and named for him.

Comiskey&#x27;s reputation was permanently tarnished by his team&#x27;s involvement in the Black Sox Scandal, although he was inducted as an executive into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.

==Early life==
Comiskey was born on August 15, 1859, in Chicago, the son of Illinois politician John Comiskey. He attended public and parochial schools in Chicago, including St. Ignatius Preparatory School, and, later, St. Mary&#x27;s College (in St. Mary&#x27;s, Kansas). He played baseball at St. Mary&#x27;s, and played for several professional teams in Chicago while apprenticed to a plumber and working at construction jobs including driving a brick delivery wagon for the construction crews building the fifth Chicago City Hall, which stood from 1873 to 1885.

==Baseball career==
===Playing and managing career===

Comiskey started his playing career as a pitcher, and moved to first base after developing arm trouble. He is credited with being the first to play hitters off first base, allowing him to cover balls hit to more of the infield. He entered the American Association in 1882 with the St. Louis Brown Stockings. He managed the team during parts of its first three seasons and became the full-time manager in 1885, leading the Browns to four consecutive American Association championships and a close second in 1889. He also played and managed for the Chicago Pirates in the Players&#x27; League (1890), the Browns again (1891), and the Cincinnati Reds in the National League (1892–1894).

===As an owner===

Comiskey left Cincinnati and the majors in fall 1894 to purchase the Western League Sioux City Cornhuskers in Sioux City, Iowa and move it to Saint Paul, Minnesota, renaming the team the St. Paul Saints. He had compiled a .264 batting average with 29 home runs, 883 RBI and 419 stolen bases. As a manager, he posted an 839–542 record.
After five seasons of sharing the Twin Cities with another Western League club in Minneapolis, Comiskey and his colleagues arranged to share Chicago with the National League, whose club (the Chicago Cubs today) played on the West Side. The St. Paul Saints moved to the South Side as the White Stockings (also the original name of the Cubs; it was eventually shortened to White Sox) of the renamed American League for the 1900 season. The American League then declared itself a major league starting in 1901.
As owner of the White Sox from 1900 until his death in 1931, Comiskey oversaw the construction of Comiskey Park in 1910 and won five American League pennants (1900, 1901, 1906, 1917, 1919) and two World Series (1906, 1917). He lost popularity with his players, who eventually came to despise him. The players&#x27; animosity towards Comiskey has been cited as a major cause of the Black Sox scandal, when eight players on the AL champions conspired to &quot;throw&quot; the 1919 World Series to the NL champion Cincinnati Reds. Comiskey was notoriously stingy (his defenders called him &quot;frugal&quot;), even forcing his players to pay to launder their own uniforms. Traci Peterson notes that, in an era when professional athletes lacked free agency, the White Sox&#x27;s formidable players had little choice but to accept Comiskey&#x27;s substandard wages. She writes: &quot;Swede Risberg and Lefty Williams made less than $3,000 a year ($ today). Joe Jackson and Buck Weaver made only $6,000 a year ($ today). Eddie Cicotte had been promised a $10,000 ($ today) bonus if he could win 30 games in a season. When Cicotte closed in on the 30-game goal, Comiskey had him benched to keep him from reaching the mark.&quot; Comiskey&#x27;s stated reason for having manager Kid Gleason bench Cicotte was that with the Sox headed for the World Series he had to protect his star pitcher&#x27;s arm (Cicotte ended up with a 29–7 record for the 1919 season). In one incident, he promised his players a bonus for winning the 1919 pennant — the &quot;bonus&quot; turned out to be a case of flat champagne.

When the scandal broke late in the 1920 season, Comiskey suspended the suspected players, while admitting in the telegram he sent to them that he knew this action cost the White Sox a second straight pennant. However, he initially defended the accused players and, in an unusual display of largesse, provided them with expensive legal representation. He ultimately supported baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis&#x27; decision to ban the implicated White Sox players from further participation in professional baseball, knowing full well that Landis&#x27; action would permanently sideline the core of his team. Indeed, the White Sox promptly tumbled into seventh place and would not be a factor in a pennant race again until , five years after Comiskey&#x27;s death. They did not win another pennant until and another World Series until .

==Legacy==
Comiskey is sometimes credited with the innovation of playing the first base position behind first base or inside the foul line, a practice which has since become common. Later he had played a large role in the dissolution of the National Commission, baseball&#x27;s former governing body, following a quarrel with Ban Johnson. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. He was also named to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in May 2022, as the selection of Cardinals managing partner William DeWitt Jr. for his accomplishments as manager of the St. Louis Browns.

Comiskey died in Eagle River, Wisconsin in 1931, and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston. Comiskey&#x27;s son J. Louis inherited the team but died a few years later. The trustees of his estate were going to sell the team, but J. Louis&#x27; widow Grace was able to gain control of the team and avoid a sale. Her two children, Dorothy Comiskey Rigney and Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Albert Comiskey II (who served in the White Sox front office in the 1940s and 1950s before he became owner), became co-owners of the team following Grace&#x27;s death in the 1950s. Dorothy sold controlling interest in the team to Bill Veeck in 1958, but Chuck remained a minority owner until 1962.

When the White Sox moved to a new ballpark in 1991, the Comiskey Park name was retained from their previous home (since 1910); it is now known as Rate Field. A statue of Comiskey stands near center field in the new ballpark.

<doc id="553695" wikidata="Q1252814" url="?curid=553695" title="St. Louis Brown Stockings">
<text>The St. Louis Brown Stockings were a professional baseball club based in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1875 to 1877, which competed on the cusps of the existences of two all-professional leagues—the National Association (NA) and the National League (NL). The team is the forerunner of, but not directly connected with, the current St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball team. After the conclusion of the 1877 season, a game-fixing scandal involving two players the Brown Stockings had acquired led the team to resign its membership in the NL. The club then declared bankruptcy and folded.

The Brown Stockings did not meet a complete demise, however. Organized by outfielder Ned Cuthbert, a few members of the former club continued to play the following year, though not now bound to any league. They played whomever they could, wherever they could, and still managed to draw crowds and make a profit, leading to play again the following two years. The Brown Stockings regained some of their former success—enough of it that, despite the recent scandal, fans of the team seemed to exhibit a short memory and began to show interest in recreating another professional St. Louis baseball team. In 1881, when German immigrant Chris von der Ahe—owner of a grocery store and saloon who was initially ignorant about baseball—saw the popularity of the club, he bought them out and soon became interested in having the team compete in a professional league. Together with beer magnates in five other cities, the American Association was formed in late 1881, and professional baseball flourished in St. Louis—this time, with the resurrected Brown Stockings the next year.

==Year in the National Association (1875)==

Joining the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or National Association (NA), in that league&#x27;s final season, the Brown Stockings were the first of two teams to represent St. Louis in a professional baseball association in 1875 (Spink 1911). Grand Avenue Grounds – the Brown Stockings&#x27; home field – was later the site of Sportsman&#x27;s Park. Outfielder Lip Pike, the previous three-time home run champion in the NA (1871, 1872, 1873), was again a top hitter, leading the league with a league-adjusted OPS of 203. Eighteen-year-old Pud Galvin is credited with leading the league in ERA (1.16) despite pitching just 62 innings, a very small total compared to the league leader in innings pitched (Al Spalding with 570.2). The Brown Stockings finished 39–29 and in fourth place in their only season in the NA.

Like the White Stockings in Chicago (established 1871), the Brown Stockings adopted uniforms and acquired a nickname by descent with variation from the famous Red Stockings of Cincinnati (est. 1869), the self-proclaimed &quot;original&quot; professional baseball team, who garnered much public interest due to an undefeated streak during a barnstorming tour in 1869 and 1870.

==National League entrant (1876–77)==

===&quot;Champions of the West&quot;===

The St. Louis Brown Stockings entered the National League (NL) as a founding team the following season along with five other former NA teams and two new professional league entrants. George Bradley pitched the first no-hitter in Major League history on July 15, 1876, when the Brown Stockings defeated the Hartford Dark Blues, 2–0. It was one of Bradley&#x27;s 16 league-leading and record-setting shutouts that season and his 1.23 ERA also led the league. Bradley and Pike (.323 batting average) led the Brown Stockings to a 45–19 record and a third-place finish. 
Although the Chicago White Stockings finished with the best regular-season record – making them the default NL champions as no playoff existed – due in part to their already feverish rivalry, the White Stockings and Brown Stockings faced off in an unofficial five-game playoff for the title &quot;Champions of the West.&quot; The Brown Stockings won the series.

===Expulsion===
With Bradley losing his effectiveness due to an arm injury in 1877 (his ERA increased to 3.31), the Brown Stockings slipped to 28–32 in 1877. The team signed stars Jim Devlin and George Hall from the Louisville Grays, only to become embroiled in a game-fixing scandal that resulted in the permanent expulsion of Devlin and Hall (and two other Grays players) from the league. The Grays and Brown Stockings both filed for bankruptcy in the aftermath of the scandal. However, the Brown Stockings continued to play as an independent barnstorming team on a semi-professional basis from 1878 to 1881.

==Aftermath of the scandal and the resurrection of the Brown Stockings (1878–1881)==
Despite the team disbanding after the 1877 season, five members of that team – second baseman/manager Mike McGeary, outfielder Ned Cuthbert, shortstop Dickey Pearce, third baseman Joe Battin and pitcher Joe Blong all comprised a team, also called the Brown Stockings, to informally play in 1878. However, at this time, popularity for baseball was low, and &quot;St. Louis Republican&quot; sportswriter Al Spink sought ways to bring back popularity for baseball in St. Louis.

The 1879 team started off by winning 24 of their first 25 games. However, the team encountered a different kind of problem. The Brown Stockings could not match their 1875 attendance average of around 2,300 per game due to their complete domination of the local amateur clubs; they averaged well under one thousand in that year after attendance fall offs between those two years. To avert the issue, they played more competitive teams from out of town. In spite of narrowing the competitive gap, St. Louis kept winning, and, as a result, more and more fans started showing up later in the year.

The 1880 season was another polar season mixed with antipathy and surging fever. August Solari, who leased Grand Avenue Park, was on the last year of the lease and the gate receipts did little to dissuade him from forgoing resigning the lease. In fact, he threatened to dismantle the ballpark. Cuthbert, who also worked for Von der Ahe at his Golden Lion Saloon, urged him to promote the team more. At this time, Von der Ahe still had not made the full realization of baseball&#x27;s popularity. For months, it was Cuthbert talking about baseball with Von der Ahe, who understood very little about the actual game, that he began to realize its significance because of its profitability.

===The formation of the Sportsman&#x27;s Park and Club Association===
Von der Ahe purchased the remainder of the lease on Grand Avenue Park, sold minority stock and raised enough money to renovate the dilapidated park. John W. Peckington, another local saloon owner, became a minority owner, creating The Sportsman&#x27;s Park and Club Association. Spink, who himself had not stopped lobbying for more interest in baseball during the sport&#x27;s relative dormancy in St. Louis, became the secretary and business manager. More fans began attend games and Spink arranged for out-of-town teams to play there, the first being a makeshift team from Cincinnati playing under the traditional name &quot;Redlegs.&quot; Profitability increased, and thus, more extensive renovations were completed, further increasing attendance, and again, profitability.

===The formation of a new all-professional league===
Again led by Cuthbert, the Brown Stockings continued to win in convincing fashion in 1881, finishing with a 35–15 record. Notable opponents included the Brooklyn Atlantics, the Philadelphia Athletics, the Akrons, and the Louisville Eclipse. The club also continued to prosper at the gate. An evolving baseball renaissance that flourished in St. Louis coincided (and possibly spilled over into) the rising enthusiasm of beer magnates over baseball in five other major cities—Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Pittsburgh. Proprietors who saw the Brown Stockings&#x27; unprecedented success and profitability after disenfranchisement began spirited dialogue with Von der Ahe about constructing a new league that could rival, and compete, with the National League. Further, the parties involved chiefly represented cities the NL had excluded. NL-imposed restrictions upon Sunday play and alcohol consumption at their parks was prohibitive to the very means these owners made their fortune. Ultimately, owners of the expansion teams announced the establishment of a new all-professional league called the American Association from the Hotel Gibson in Cincinnati on November 2, 1881. With that act, the St. Louis newspapers lauded Von der Ahe for resurrecting a &quot;corpse&quot; and transforming it &quot;into the liveliest being imaginable.&quot;

*The Finish, Wins, and Losses columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. Regular and postseason records are combined only at the bottom of the list.
*The GB column lists &quot;Games Back&quot; from the team that finished in first place that season. It is determined by finding the difference in wins plus the difference in losses divided by two.
*The Brown Stockings participated in a best-of-five post-season exhibition with the Chicago White Stockings for the unofficial title of &quot;Champions of the West.&quot; Despite the White Stockings winning the NL pennant by finishing with the best regular-season record, they challenged the Brown Stockings to this series because St. Louis won the regular-season series and St. Louis finished second in the NL in terms of winning percentage (45–19, .703 winning percentage) although they were virtually tied for third place with the Hartford Dark Blues (47–21, .691). All five games were played because the Series proved highly profitable.
*Because the Brown Stockings had resigned from the National League after the 1877 season and did not enter another professional league or play as an all-professional team again until the 1882 season in the American Association, games played between 1878 and 1881 were exhibition games only and therefore do not count as official games.
*Major League Baseball considers this to be the Brown Stockings&#x27; official all-time Major League record. MLB does not count the years played in the National Association, post-season games, exhibition or semi-professional (amateur) games towards the official record.

<text>A straw hat is a wide-brimmed hat woven out of straw or straw-like synthetic materials. Straw hats are a type of sun hat designed to shade the head and face from direct sunlight, but are also used in fashion as a decorative element or a uniform.

==Materials==
Commonly used fibers are:

* Wheat straw: (Milan straw, Tuscan, Livorno), 
* Rye straw: used for the traditional &quot;bryl&quot; straw hats popular among the peasants of Belarus, southwestern Russia and Ukraine. 
* Toquilla straw: flexible and durable fiber which is often made into hats, known as Panama hats, in Ecuador.
* Buntal straw (also called Parabuntal): from unopened Palm leaves or stems of the Buri Palm, 
* Baku straw: 1x1 woven, made from the young stalks of the Talipot palm from Malabar and Ceylon,
* Braided hemp, 
* Raffia, 
* Shantung straw: made from high-performance paper which is rolled into a yarn to imitate straw, historically it was made of buntal
* Toyo straw: cellophane coated Washi, 
* Bangora straw: made from a lower grade of Washi, 
* Paperbraids: made from different paper strands from viscose from different Plants (Swiss Paglinastraw), (Silkpaper, Rice paper), 
* Sisal (also called Parasisal for finer 2x2 weaves), 
* Seagrass (Xian), 
* Visca straw: an artificial straw made by spinning viscose in a flat filament capable of being braided, woven, or knitted and used especially for women&#x27;s hats, 
* Rush straw: a thick, stiff straw, used to manufacture inexpensive casual sun hats, made from rush grass (Juncus effesus, Juncus polycephalus), from the bulrushtypes sedge grass (Schoenoplectus lacustris, Cyperus papyrus, Typha (Typha domingensis, syn.

== Manufacture ==
There are several styles of straw hats, but all of them are woven using some form of plant fibre. Many of these hats are formed in a similar way to felt hats; they are softened by steam or by submersion in hot water, and then formed by hand or over a hat block. Finer and more expensive straw hats have a tighter and more consistent weave. Since it takes much more time to weave a larger hat than a smaller one, larger hats are more expensive.

== History ==
Straw hats have been worn in Africa and Asia since after the Middle Ages during the summer months, and have changed little between the medieval times and today. They are worn, mostly by men, by all classes. Many can be seen in the calendar miniatures of the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry.
The &quot;mokorotlo&quot;, a local design of a straw hat, is the national symbol of the Basotho and Lesotho peoples, and of the nation of Lesotho. It is displayed on Lesotho license plates.

Betsey Metcalf Baker (née Betsey Metcalf; 1786–1867) was a manufacturer of straw bonnets, entrepreneur, and social activist based in Providence, Rhode Island and Westwood, Massachusetts. At age twelve, she developed a technique for braiding straw, allowing her to emulate the styles of expensive straw bonnets and make them accessible to working-class women. Rather than patent her technique, Baker taught the women in her community how to make straw bonnets, enabling the development of a cottage industry in New England.

Because of the Napoleonic Wars, the United States embargoed all trade with France and Great Britain for a time, creating a need for American-made hats to replace European millinery. The straw-weaving industry filled the gap, with over $500,000 ($9 million in today&#x27;s money) worth of straw bonnets produced in Massachusetts alone in 1810.

On May 5, 1809, Mary Dixon Kies received a patent for a new technique of weaving straw with silk and thread to make hats. Some sources say she was the first woman to receive a US Patent, however other sources cite Hannah Slater in 1793, or Hazel Irwin, who received a patent for a cheese press in 1808, as the first.

President Theodore Roosevelt posed for a series of photos at the Panama Canal construction site in 1906. He was portrayed as a strong, rugged leader dressed crisply in light-colored suits and stylish straw fedoras. This helped popularize the straw &quot;Panama hat&quot;.

The Old Order Amish, in the United States, still wear straw hats (similar to a Boater Hat), especially in the summer months. In the winter, or for formal wear, they will wear a felt hat.

== Types of straw hats ==
* Boater hat – a formal straw hat with a flat top and brim.
* Buntal hat – a semi-formal or informal traditional straw hat from the Philippines made from buntal fiber
* Conical hat – the distinctive hat worn primarily by farmers in Southeast Asia
* Panama hat – a fine and expensive hat made in Ecuador.
* Sombrero Vueltiao - A straw hat with intricate patterns made from caña flecha by the Zenú people of Colombia.
* Salakot – a traditional conical or pointed rounded hat made usually made from rattan from the Philippines. It can also be made from gourds, tortoiseshell, or other fibers and weaving materials.
* Straw bonnet - Bonnet has been used as the name for a wide variety of headgear for both sexes—more often female—from the Middle Ages to the present. Some are made of straw.

== Arts ==
Artwork produced during the Middle Ages shows, among the more fashionably dressed, possibly the most spectacular straw hats ever seen on men in the West, notably those worn in the Arnolfini Portrait of 1434 by Jan van Eyck (tall, stained black) and by Saint George in a painting by Pisanello of around the same date (left). In the middle of the 18th century, it was fashionable for rich ladies to dress as country girls with a low crowned and wide brimmed straw hat to complete the look.

<doc id="553698" wikidata="Q310406" url="?curid=553698" title="Al-Saadi Gaddafi">
<text>Al-Saadi Muammar Gaddafi, also spelt as Al-Saadi Moammer Al-Gaddafi (; born 25 May 1973), is a Libyan retired professional football player. He captained the national team, but his career was widely attributed to the influence of his father Muammar Gaddafi, the country&#x27;s leader at the time.

In 2011, Gaddafi was the commander of Libya&#x27;s Special Forces and participated in the Libyan Civil War. An Interpol notice was issued against him in 2011. In March 2014, he was arrested in Niger and extradited to Libya, where he faced murder charges, which he was cleared of in 2018. In August 2015, a video surfaced allegedly showing him being tortured.

He was a central figure in the SNC-Lavalin scandal in Canada. In 2019, SNC-Lavalin, Canada&#x27;s biggest engineering firm, pled guilty to paying Saadi $28 million in bribes to secure construction contracts in Libya. SNC-Lavalin also allegedly paid over $2 million for Saadi&#x27;s 2008 visit to Canada, including bodyguards, companion services, $10,000 to an escort service in Vancouver, a strip club in Montreal, and box seats for a Spice Girls concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.

He was released in September 2021 and left for Turkey.

== Football career ==
Gaddafi is known for his participation in Libyan football, which was arranged in his favor. One law forbade announcing the name of any football player with the exception of Gaddafi. Only numbers of other players were announced. Referees favored Gaddafi&#x27;s club and security forces were used to silence protests.

On 6 June 2000, the BBC reported that Gaddafi had signed with Maltese champions Birkirkara F.C. and would play for them in the Champions League. The move failed to materialize. In 2003, he signed for Italian Serie A team Perugia, employing Diego Maradona as his technical consultant and Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson as his personal trainer.

He made only one substitute appearance against Juventus for Perugia before failing a drug test, due to presence in his system of the illegal substance Nandrolone. An article in &quot;la Repubblica&quot; said that &quot;Even at twice his current speed he would still be twice as slow as slow itself.&quot;

He was captain of the Libya national football team, captain of his home club in Tripoli, and president of the Libyan Football Federation.

Gaddafi joined UEFA Champions League qualifiers Udinese Calcio in 2005–06, playing only 10 minutes in an end-of-season league match against Cagliari Calcio. He joined U.C. Sampdoria during the 2006–07 season, without playing a single match.

== Business activities ==
In 2006, Al-Saadi Gaddafi and the Jamahiriya government launched a project to create a semi-autonomous city similar to Hong Kong in Libya, stretching 40 km between Tripoli and the Tunisian border. The proposed new city would become a high tech, banking, medical and educational center not requiring visas to enter. The city would have its own international airport and a major seaport. Gaddafi promised religious tolerance with both &quot;synagogues and churches&quot; and no discrimination in this new metropolis. The new city would have &quot;Western-style&quot; business laws that Saadi thought European and American companies would find welcoming and familiar.

Gaddafi used to take great interest in the affairs of many of Libya&#x27;s other business interests like Tamoil, the oil refining and marketing company owned by the Libyan government, before the overthrow of the regime.

=== Italian lawsuit ===
In July 2010, Gaddafi was ordered by an Italian court to pay €392,000 to a luxurious Ligurian hotel for an unpaid bill dating back to a month-long stay in the summer of 2007.

== Personal life ==
Gaddafi is married to the daughter of al-Khweildi al-Hmeidi, a Libyan military commander who was involved in the 1969 Libyan coup d&#x27;état that brought Gaddafi to power.

In 2009, a U.S. diplomatic cable called Gaddafi &quot;the black sheep&quot; of Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s family. It mentioned scuffles with European police, &quot;abuse of drugs and alcohol, excessive partying&quot; and &quot;profligate affairs with women and men&quot;. Gaddafi&#x27;s bisexuality had partly prompted the arrangement of his marriage to the commander&#x27;s daughter, the cable said. Saadi was having a relationship with Bulgarian national Dafinka Mircheva. After the Battle of Tripoli in 2011, Saadi&#x27;s former teammate at Al Ahly Tripoli and close friend, Reda Al Tawarghi, alleged that Saadi had jailed him for years for rejecting his &quot;homosexual advances&quot;.

== 2011 to present ==

=== Libyan civil war ===
On 27 February 2011, Saadi was interviewed by Christiane Amanpour on ABC News, where he warned of imminent civil war and that if his father left Libya, the power vacuum would only lead to more chaos. He also stated that he was looking for a lawyer to fight the travel ban against him levied by UN Security Council Resolution 1970.

On 15 March 2011, there were unconfirmed reports that a pilot by the name of Muhammad Mokhtar Osman had flown his jet into the Gaddafi stronghold of Bab al-Azizia in Tripoli damaging it and injuring him and his brother Khamis.

Speaking to BBC Panorama, a former Jamahiriya soldier claimed that Gaddafi had personally ordered to shoot unarmed protesters in Benghazi when visiting the city&#x27;s army barracks at the beginning of the uprising. Gaddafi confirmed that he had been at the barracks but denied giving orders to fire on protesters.

Gaddafi was reportedly the driving force behind a change in fighting tactics of the government&#x27;s forces. Instead of using heavy infantry, tanks and armored cars – which could easily be distinguished from the Free Libyan Army and then destroyed by allied fighter jets – the fight against the rebels was pursued with small, fast and versatile units.

The rebels claimed that they captured him during the Battle of Tripoli, on 21 August, but later the claim turned out to be false.

On 24 August, Gaddafi contacted CNN, stating that he had the authority to negotiate on behalf of loyalist forces, and wished to discuss a ceasefire with U.S. and NATO authorities. A week later he contacted Al Arabiya, stating his father was ready to step down, and called for dialogue with the National Transitional Council.

On 5 September, Gaddafi said in an interview with CNN that an &quot;aggressive&quot; speech by his brother Saif al-Islam had led to the breakdown of talks between NTC forces and Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid, and said he had not seen his father in two months. Gaddafi also claimed a position of neutrality in the conflict and offered to mediate.

=== Flight to Niger ===
On 11 September 2011, Gaddafi fled to Niger with the help of his Australian bodyguard, Gary Peters, and was allowed entrance on humanitarian grounds. According to the government of Niger, they planned to detain Gaddafi while determining what to do with him. Peters had also been trying to assemble a team to smuggle Saadi to Barbados or Venezuela.

On 29 September 2011, an Interpol red notice was issued for Gaddafi. Brigi Rafini, the Prime minister of Niger said he would not allow Gaddafi to be extradited.

On 11 November 2011, Niger&#x27;s President Mahamadou Issoufou said his government had decided to grant Gaddafi asylum &quot;on humanitarian grounds&quot;.

On 7 December 2011, the Mexican Interior Secretary said that Mexican intelligence agents broke up a smuggling ring attempting to bring Gaddafi into Mexico under a false name.

On 10 February 2012, Saadi called into Al-Arabiya television by phone, where he claimed that he was in contact with Libyan tribes, militias, the NTC, the national army, and other members of the Gaddafi family from his hideout in Niger. He also claimed that a large-scale Gaddafi loyalist uprising was imminent, that the NTC was not legitimate, and that he was ready to return to Libya &quot;at any minute.&quot;

On 3 July 2012, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Saadi and his entourage had been dining out regularly at upscale restaurants and frequenting nightclubs in Niamey despite Niger&#x27;s government claim that he was under house arrest. It was also reported that the state guesthouse he was allegedly under house arrest in was in fact &quot;a luxurious, high-walled mansion in one of the city&#x27;s most affluent neighborhoods, near the U.S. and French embassies.&quot;

=== Extradition and torture allegations ===
On 5 March 2014, Libya announced that Gaddafi had been extradited by Niger and was in Tripoli. His lawyer, Nick Kaufman, protested about the move stating &quot;extradition suggests that this was a legal process where Saadi Gadhafi was accorded a lawyer, a court hearing, and…it&#x27;s not even clear to me that that even took place&quot;. Later that month, Gaddafi gave an apology to the Libyan people from a Tripoli prison which was broadcast on Libyan state TV. He apologized for &quot;all the harm I&#x27;ve caused and for disturbing the security and stability of Libya&quot; and called for &quot;those who carry weapons to hand over their weapons&quot;. He said he was being treated well in prison.

In May 2015, Gaddafi appeared in a Tripoli court and was formally charged with unlawful imprisonment and murder for the 2005 killing of football player and coach Bashir al-Riani.

In early August 2015, a video surfaced that appeared to show a blindfolded Gaddafi being forced to listen to other men allegedly being tortured in the next room. Then the guards beat the man appearing to be Gaddafi on the feet as he screams, after asking him if preferred to be beaten on the feet or on his buttocks. &quot;It does appear to be Saadi Gaddafi,&quot; one of his lawyers, Melinda Taylor, told RT. &quot;He looks the same in [the] sense [that] his head ... [had been] shaved which happened to him last year.&quot; No legal team appears to be present.

International human rights groups and activists condemned the video, which appeared to have been recorded at al-Hadba prison in Tripoli, and was first released by Arabic network Clear News.

&quot;This is a shocking video that raises questions about conditions inside the prison,&quot; said Karim Khan, a British attorney who represents Libya&#x27;s former Prime minister Baghdadi Mahmudi, who is also at al-Hadba. &quot;The international community needs to demand a full investigation.&quot;

In June 2017, Haitham Tajouri&#x27;s Tripoli Revolutionaries&#x27; Brigade seized al-Hadba prison and relocated senior Gaddafi regime figures, including Saadi, to the Radisson Blu Al Mahary Hotel Tripoli. While under interrogation by Tajouri&#x27;s militia, Saadi claimed that Mohammed bin Zayed, the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the UAE, was working on a plan to bring Saif al-Islam Gaddafi to power in order to &quot;calm the situation down&quot; in Libya.

An appeals court on 3 April 2018 cleared Saadi from the charge of murdering the footballer Bashir. He was however fined 500 Libyan dinars and a suspended one-year prison term for drinking and possessing alcohol.

=== Release and alleged exile to Turkey ===
As of 5 September 2021, he has been released from custody from al-Hadaba prison and left for Turkey, but Turkey&#x27;s foreign ministry claimed it had &quot;no knowledge&quot; of Saadi&#x27;s presence in Istanbul. On 10 September 2021, Moussa Ibrahim confirmed that Saadi was in Turkey and that Egypt and Saudi Arabia had also offered to host Saadi. It was claimed that Saadi&#x27;s captors denied him the appropriate medical care.

On 27 May 2022, the Panel of Experts on Libya submitted a report to the UN Security Council accusing Turkey of shielding Saadi from the Interpol and deliberately violating UN&#x27;s Libya resolutions. Turkey declined to answer inquiries from UN investigators regarding Saadi&#x27;s whereabouts. As of 2023, he was reported to reside in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

<text>In molecular biology, housekeeping genes are typically constitutive genes that are required for the maintenance of basic cellular function, and are expressed in all cells of an organism under normal and patho-physiological conditions. Although some housekeeping genes are expressed at relatively constant rates in most non-pathological situations, the expression of other housekeeping genes may vary depending on experimental conditions.

The origin of the term &quot;housekeeping gene&quot; remains obscure. Literature from 1976 used the term to describe specifically tRNA and rRNA. For experimental purposes, the expression of one or multiple housekeeping genes is used as a reference point for the analysis of expression levels of other genes. The key criterion for the use of a housekeeping gene in this manner is that the chosen housekeeping gene is uniformly expressed with low variance under both control and experimental conditions. Validation of housekeeping genes should be performed before their use in gene expression experiments such as RT-PCR. Recently a web-based database of human and mouse housekeeping genes and reference genes/transcripts, named Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas (HRT Atlas), was developed to offer updated list of housekeeping genes and reliable candidate reference genes/transcripts for RT-qPCR data normalization. This database can be accessed at http://www.housekeeping.unicamp.br.

== Housekeeping gene regulation ==
Housekeeping genes account for majority of the active genes in the genome, and their expression is obviously vital to survival. The housekeeping gene expression levels are fine-tuned to meet the metabolic requirements in various tissues. Biochemical studies on transcription initiation of the housekeeping gene promoters have been difficult, partly due to the less-characterized promoter motifs and transcription initiation process.

Human housekeeping gene promoters are generally depleted of TATA-box, have high GC content and high incidence of CpG Islands. In Drosophila, where promoter specific CpG Islands are absent, housekeeping gene promoters contain DNA elements like DRE, E-box or DPE. Transcription start sites of housekeeping genes can span over a region of around 100 bp whereas transcription start sites of developmentally regulated genes are usually focused in a narrow region. Little is known about how the dispersed transcription initiation of housekeeping gene is established. There are transcription factors that are specifically enriched on and regulate housekeeping gene promoters. Furthermore, housekeeping promoters are regulated by housekeeping enhancers but not developmentally regulated enhancers.

==Common housekeeping genes in humans==
The following is a partial list of &quot;housekeeping genes.&quot; For a more complete and updated list, see HRT Atlas database compiled by Bidossessi W. Hounkpe et al. The database was constructed by mining more than 12000 human and mouse RNA-seq datasets.

<doc id="553706" wikidata="Q120813" url="?curid=553706" title="Aireys Inlet">
<text>Aireys Inlet is a town located on the Great Ocean Road, southwest of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Aireys Inlet is located between Anglesea and Lorne, and joined with Fairhaven, Moggs Creek, and Eastern View to the west.

Many surfers holiday in Aireys Inlet to take advantage of the popular Fairhaven beach. As the inclination of the beach can change dramatically between years, the surf is regarded as unpredictable. Swimmers should take note there is a strong rip current.

Painkalac Creek, which separates Aireys Inlet from Fairhaven, forms a salt lake or inlet behind the sand dunes before it cuts through to the ocean. Due to low water levels in the inlet it is not often that the inlet breaks through.

Aireys Inlet is also famous for Split Point Lighthouse which was featured in the popular children&#x27;s TV show Round The Twist.

There is also a horseshoe-shaped reef at Step Beach which forms an excellent swimming hole at low tide. The towns main attraction, the Split Point Lighthouse overlooks the inlet. The lighthouse has made Aireys Inlet an icon along the Great Ocean Road.

==History==
In the early 19th century, before British settlement, the escaped convict William Buckley lived here in a primitive hut eating fish, shellfish, wild raspberries and sugar ants. Aireys Inlet was known to the Aboriginals of the time as &quot;Managwhawz&quot;. The town takes its current name from John Moore Cole Airey, who settled in the area in 1842.

The Post Office opened on 1 April 1893.

==Population==
At the , Aireys Inlet had a population of 802. 83.4% of people were born in Australia and 88.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 53.9% and Catholic 16.1%.

== Geography ==
Fairhaven, Moggs Creek, and Eastern View are in the same postal area as Aireys Inlet.

== Climate ==
Aireys Inlet possesses an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with tepid, relatively dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Average maxima vary from in January and February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Mean precipitation is moderately low (averaging per annum), but rainfall is frequent, as Aireys Inlet receives 152.1 precipitation days annually (with a maximum frequency of rain in winter). Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 7 February 2009 to on 28 July 1990.

=== Beaches and coastline ===

While the coastline at adjacent Fairhaven is a long uninterrupted sand beach, the coast at Aireys Inlet is a series of rock shelves, interrupted by sandy swimming beaches, most of which are relatively secluded. Each beach has its own character, a result of differing lengths, orientation and nearby rock formations. Beaches include Sandy Gully, Steppy Beach and Sunnymeade.

== School ==
Aireys Inlet has one school, Aireys Inlet Primary School (P-6), which until the end of 2016 was a campus of the then Lorne-Aireys Inlet P-12 College.

== Sport ==

* Australian football: The Aireys Inlet Eels Football Club competes in the AFL Barwon junior competition.
* Tennis: The Aireys Inlet and District Tennis Club competes in the Geelong Tennis Association.

==Literature and media==

During the early 1950s the Australian crime author Arthur Upfield lived at Aireys Inlet. His novel &quot;The New Shoe&quot; (1951) is based on the township and the lighthouse. Some of the novel&#x27;s characters drew on local identities.

Many scenes from the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Round the Twist&quot; were filmed at or around the area of the Split Point Lighthouse.

In 2005 the Bollywood movie &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot; was produced in Melbourne with many scenes being shot around Aireys Inlet, Fairhaven and Anglesea.

At low tide it is possible to walk (or scramble) around all these rocks and beaches, making it possible to walk along the beach, all the way from Eastern View - the historical start of the Great Ocean Road, all the way to Anglesea.

Much like Anglesea, Aireys Inlet is served by Surf Coast Times, a local newspaper for the Surf Coast published weekly on Fridays. Television services are received via a translator in Anglesea, carrying the Melbourne channels, although TV coverage from the translator is very low. Radio services are received on AM and FM from Melbourne and Geelong.

==1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires==

Aireys Inlet was devastated by the infamous 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires in which a large number of houses were burnt down. However, after a brief lull, interest in the area resumed and has been steadily climbing since. Properties, especially those with an ocean view, are becoming increasingly sought after, some going for greater than A$1 million.

==Heritage listed sites==

Aireys Inlet has a number of heritage listed sites, including:

* Great Ocean Road
* Split Point Lightstation Complex

== Notable people ==

* John Airey, the town&#x27;s founder, for whom it was named
* William Buckley, British convict who lived in the area before the town&#x27;s origin

<doc id="553714" wikidata="Q2639708" url="?curid=553714" title="Double dactyl">
<text>The double dactyl is a verse form invented by Anthony Hecht and Paul Pascal in 1951.

== Form==

Like the limerick, the double dactyl has a fixed structure, is usually humorous, and is rigid in its prosodic structure. The double dactyl&#x27;s prosodic requirements are more strenuous due to its increased length, and its specific requirements as to subject matter and word choice much more rigid, making it significantly more difficult to write.

There must be two stanzas, each comprising three lines of dactylic dimeter ( ¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘ ˘ ) followed by a line consisting of just a choriamb ( ¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ). The last lines of these two stanzas must rhyme. Further, the first line of the first stanza is repetitive nonsense, and the second line of the first stanza is the subject of the poem, which in the purest instances of the form is a double-dactylic proper noun. (Hecht and other poets sometimes bent or ignored this rule, as in the Robison poem below.) There is also a requirement for at least one line, preferably the second line of the second stanza, to be entirely one double dactyl word. Some purists still follow Hecht and Pascal&#x27;s original rule that no single six-syllable word, once used in a double dactyl, should ever be knowingly used again.

An example by John Hollander:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Higgledy piggledy,
Benjamin Harrison,
Twenty-third president
Was, and, as such,

Served between Clevelands and
Save for this trivial
Idiosyncrasy,
Didn&#x27;t do much.&lt;/poem&gt;

Metapoetically, Roger L. Robison crafted this poem describing itself:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Long-short-short, long-short-short
Dactyls in dimeter,
Verse form with choriambs
(Masculine rhyme):

One sentence (two stanzas)
Hexasyllabically
Challenges poets who
Don&#x27;t have the time.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Dutch version, called &quot;&quot; after a children&#x27;s verse, was introduced in the Dutch language by Drs. P.

== McWhirtle ==
A McWhirtle is a light verse form similar to a double dactyl, invented in 1989 by American poet Bruce Newling. McWhirtles share essentially the same form as double dactyls, but without the strict requirements, making them easier to write. Specifically:

* McWhirtles do not require a nonsense phrase (e.g., &quot;Higgledy piggledy&quot;) on the first line.
* There is no requirement for a double-dactylic word in the second stanza.
* There is an extra unstressed syllable added to the beginning of the first line of each stanza.
* Although the meter is the same as in a double-dactyl, syllables may move from the end of one line to the beginning of the next for readability. This plus the extra unstressed syllable makes McWhirtles essentially an informal double amphibrach.

The looser form allows poets additional freedom to include additional rhymes and other stylistic devices.

The form is named after the fictional protagonist in an early example by Newling, included with his original written description of the form, dated August 12, 1989; but his first McWhirtle, in which his friend &quot;Skip&quot; Ungar is the protagonist and which also appeared with his original description, was:

The Piano Player

: &quot;I read in the papers&quot;
: &quot;That Harry F. Ungar&quot;
: &quot;Performs in a night spot&quot;
: &quot;Near soigne Scotch Plains,&quot;

: &quot;Caressing the keyboard&quot;
: &quot;While affluent yuppies&quot;
: &quot;Are eating and drinking&quot;
: &quot;Their capital gains.&quot;

The first published description of the McWhirtle, with examples, was in E.O. Parrott, ed., &quot;How to Be Well-Versed in Poetry&quot;, London: Viking, 1990, pp. 197–200; and the verse form was also described in Anne H. Soukhanov, &quot;Word Watch&quot; - The Stories Behind the Words of Our Lives, New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1995, pp. 388–89.

An example by American poet Kenn Nesbitt:

Fernando the Fearless

: &quot;We&#x27;re truly in awe of&quot;
: &quot;Fernando the Fearless&quot;
: &quot;who needed no net&quot;
: &quot;for the flying trapeze.&quot;

: &quot;Alas, what a shame&quot;
: &quot;it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult&quot;
: &quot;catching a bar&quot;
: &quot;in the midst of a sneeze.&quot;

== In literature ==

* The first published collection of double dactyls was &quot;Jiggery-Pokery: A Compendium of Double Dactyls&quot;, edited by Anthony Hecht and John Hollander. Many of the poems had previously appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot; starting in 1966.
* John Bellairs&#x27;s classic fantasy novel &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; (1969) contains several double dactyls, used as nonsense magic spells.
* The first published collection of double dactyls by a single author was &quot;Centicore Poems, [Series] I; being, A Non-canonical Collection of Entirely Prejudiced Double Dactyls&quot; &quot;perpetrated by Jay Dillon&quot; (Ann Arbor, Michigan: Dactylomaniac Press, 1972), OCLC (Worldcat) no. 498258515. Only one copy of this book is known to survive, in the British Library (London), General Reference Collection shelfmark X.902/1639.
* &quot;Abbreviated Lays&quot; is a 2003 collection of double dactyl poetry about Roman history.

<doc id="553716" wikidata="Q313945" url="?curid=553716" title="Gosho Aoyama">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist best known for his manga series &quot;Case Closed&quot; (&quot;Detective Conan&quot;, 1994–present). As of 2017, his various manga series had a combined 250 million copies in print worldwide.

== Educational background ==
Aoyama was talented in drawing even at an early age. In elementary school, his painting of &quot;Yukiai War&quot; won a competition and was displayed at the Tottori Daimaru Department Store. He has an older brother who is a scientist and helps him out with the &quot;gimmicks&quot; in &quot;Case Closed&quot;. He has another brother who is a doctor.

Aoyama graduated from Yuraikuei High School, before going on to study at Nihon University College of Art in Tokyo. In winter of 1986, Aoyama won a comic contest for freshmen students. When he was an art student, Aoyama had a part-time job working at Tokyo Disneyland, where he painted backgrounds for Pirates of the Caribbean.

== Career ==
Aoyama made his debut as a manga artist with &quot;Chotto Mattete&quot;, which was published in the magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; in winter of 1987. Shortly after that, he began &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; in the same magazine. &quot;Magic Kaito&quot; protagonist Kaito Kuroba later appeared in &quot;Case Closed&quot;.

Between 1988 and 1993, Aoyama created the series &quot;Yaiba&quot;, which ran for 24 volumes. Later, he would release other manga series in single volumes, such as &quot;Third Baseman No.4&quot; and &quot;Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s Collection of Short Stories&quot;. Aoyama also designed the characters for the &quot;Twilight of Edo Japan&quot; chapter in the 1994 video game &quot;Live A Live&quot;.

Aoyama began serializing &quot;Case Closed&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; on January 19, 1994. When the series was first released in English, it was given the title &quot;Case Closed&quot;.

== Awards and recognition ==

Aoyama has won two awards for his work as a manga artist. In 1992, he won the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen for &quot;Yaiba&quot;. He would go on to win the same award for a second time in 2001, this time for &quot;Case Closed&quot;.

<text>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is an Australian government statutory authority within the Communications portfolio. ACMA was formed on 1 July 2005 with the merger of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority.

ACMA is responsible for collecting broadcasting, radiocommunication and telecommunication taxes, and regulating Australian media. It does this through various legislation, regulations, standards and codes of practice. ACMA is a converged regulator, created to oversee the convergence of telecommunications, broadcasting, radio communications and the internet.

==Organization==
ACMA is an independent government agency managed by an executive team comprising the Chair (who is also the Agency Head), Deputy Chair (who is also the chief executive officer). ACMA collects revenue on behalf of the Australian Government through broadcasting, radiocommunications and telecommunications taxes, charges and license fees. It also collects revenue from price-based allocation of spectrum. The corporate structure comprises four divisions – Communications Infrastructure, Content, Consumer and Citizen, Corporate and Research, and Legal Services.

ACMA has responsibilities under four principal Acts – the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. There are another 22 Acts to which the agency responds in such areas as spam, the Do Not Call Register and interactive gambling. The ACMA also creates and administers more than 523 legislative instruments including radiocommunications, spam and telecommunications regulations; and license area plans for free-to-air broadcasters.

ACMA&#x27;s main offices are located in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.

==Convergence and change==
Communications convergence is the merging of the previously distinct services by which information is communicated – telephone, television (free-to-air and subscription) radio and newspapers – over digital platforms. ACMA also works with industry and citizens to solve new concerns and mitigate risks arising in the evolving networked society and information economy, recognizing that Australians are interacting with digital communications and content in changing ways. Not only does ACMA address a wide range of responsibilities, it does so against a backdrop of rapid change.

Many of the controls on the production and distribution of content and the provision of telecommunications services through licensing or other subsidiary arrangements, or by standards and codes (whether co-regulatory or self-regulatory) are subject to revision and adaptation to the networked society and information economy. Moreover, there are new platforms, applications, business models, value chains and forms of social interaction available with more to come in what is a dynamic, innovative environment. Other challenges for regulators include cross-jurisdictional issues and the need for engagement and collaboration with stakeholders locally, regionally and internationally. 

ACMA has developed a &#x27;converged communications regulator&#x27; framework which seeks to bring to the global discussion a &#x27;common ground&#x27; to deliver outcomes in the public interest. The four cornerstone parts to the framework, each divided into two sub-streams, are outlined below along with the main functions of ACMA under each task.

Bridging to the future – active engagement with the currents of change and proactive development of responses through thought leadership and regulatory development:
* Reviewing industry standards and codes of practice.
* Developing more flexible licensing.
* Updating spectrum management tools for spectrum sharing technologies.
* Research and analysis to examine the effectiveness of current regulation and to provide evidence-informed regulatory development.
Transforming the agency – adapting the organization to the changing world of convergence by ensuring a structural fit with convergence and a focus on agency innovation:
* Creating resilience through capability training.
* Evidence-based reporting on industry performance, service offerings, consumer benefits, levels of adoption and use.
* Administration of spam intelligence database.
* Evidence-based approach to tracking industry performance during digital TV transition
Major program delivery – through resource and program management with fully effective corporate governance:
* Development and implementation of a national cybersafe education program.
* Administering the Do Not Call Register.
* Administering contracts for phone services for people who are deaf or have a hearing or speech impediment.
* Developing and implementing a corporate governance framework and ICT strategic plan
Effective regulation – doing the &#x27;day job&#x27; of the regulatory agency with effective and efficient regulatory administration and operations coupled with extensive stakeholder engagement:
* Regulating telecommunications and broadcasting services, internet content and datacasting services
* Managing access to the radiofrequency spectrum bands through radiocommunications licensing, including amateur radio licensing.
* Resolving competing demands for spectrum through broadcasting license arrangements and price-based allocation methods.
* Regulating use of the radio-frequency spectrum and minimizing radio communications interference.
* Regulating compliance with the relevant legislation, license conditions, codes of practice, standards, service guarantees and other safeguards.
* Promoting and facilitating industry self-regulatory and co-regulatory solutions
* Informing industry and consumers about communications regulation.

Representing Australia&#x27;s interests internationally (see International Telecommunication Union)

==ACMA Hotline for reporting offensive or illegal online content==
The ACMA administers a complaints mechanism for Australian residents and law enforcement agencies to report prohibited online content, including child sexual abuse material. Within the scheme, which operates under Schedules 5 and 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, content is assessed with reference to the same criteria within the National Classification Scheme that applies to films and computer games in Australia.

The ACMA Hotline is one of a global network of international bodies within INHOPE – the International Association of Internet Hotlines that exchange information on child abuse images, pinpointing the hosting countries to help eradicate them from the web. INHOPE consists of 44 members in 38 countries, with members including the Internet Watch Foundation (UK), the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (USA), Cyberia (Canada), Friendly Runlet Foundation (Russian Federation) and the Internet Hotline Center Japan.

If prohibited online content is found in Australia, it is issued with a take-down notice after being formally classified; if it is hosted overseas it is notified to optional end-user Family Friendly Filters that are accredited by industry through the Internet Industry Association (these are available at cost from ISPs). All potentially illegal content is reported by the ACMA to law enforcement in Australia, or, in the case of child sexual abuse material hosted overseas, through INHOPE for rapid police notification and take-down in the host country.

The ACMA publishes comprehensive statistics and information about the ACMA Hotline on its website. The majority of investigations the ACMA conducts concern online child sexual abuse material. Complaints to the ACMA Hotline are usually made via a webform on the ACMA&#x27;s website.

Popularly held misconceptions about the ACMA&#x27;s regulatory role include that it investigates and takes action on whole websites (it investigates specific URLs, images or files) and that the ACMA causes blocking of content at an ISP level (it notifies overseas hosted content to optional end-user filters).

In February 2013, the ACMA and Australian Federal Police announced a new agreement for sharing of information about serious child abuse material, including an arrangement whereby the ACMA can report content through INHOPE based on where content may be produced, as well as where it is hosted

During National Child Protection Week 2013, the ACMA Hotline conducted 418 investigations involving over 4,700 images of abused children to Australian police agencies or through the INHOPE international network for action overseas. During the week, the ACMA announced it is now working more closely with CrimeStoppers in Australia to make it easier to report illegal online content.

The ACMA&#x27;s online role is not connected to ISP blocking &#x27;worst of the worst&#x27; child abuse material, which was operated by ISPs and the Australian Federal Police. In July 2015, this function moved to the Office of the Children&#x27;s safety Commissioner.

==Do Not Call Register==

ACMA operates Australia&#x27;s Do Not Call Register, which is a scheme to reduce unsolicited telemarketing calls and marketing faxes to individuals who have indicated they do not want to receive such calls by registering their private and domestic telephone (including mobile) and fax numbers on the Register. The scheme has been in operation since May 2007. Since mid-2013, Salmat has managed the Register on behalf of ACMA.

==Spam Act==

ACMA is responsible for enforcing the Spam Act 2003 which prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages with an Australian link. A message has an Australian link if it originates, or was authorised, in Australia, or if the message was accessed in Australia. Anyone who sends commercial email, SMS, or instant messages must ensure that the message is sent with consent, contains sender identification and contact information and includes a functional unsubscribe facility. Some exemptions apply.

Members of the public are able to make complaints and reports about commercial electronic messages to ACMA which may conduct formal investigations and take enforcement actions.

==Australian Internet Security Initiative and malware==
The ACMA developed the Australian Internet Security Initiative (AISI) to help address the problem of computers being compromised by the surreptitious installation of malicious software (malware). &#x27;Malware&#x27; enables a computer to be controlled remotely for illegal and harmful activities without the owner&#x27;s knowledge.

Malware can:
* access sensitive personal information stored on the computer such as resumes, sensitive documents, photographs/videos, and banking and other login or password details
* gain remote access to the computer&#x27;s camera and microphone
* form part of a larger group of computers known as &#x27;botnets&#x27;. Among other things, botnets are used to help with the mass distribution of spam and other malware, the hosting of phishing sites and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on websites.

== Telecommunications Sector Security Reform (TSSR) ==
The Telecommunications Sector Security Reform (TSSR) commenced on 18 September 2018.

TSSR introduces four new measures:

* a security obligation, which requires carriers and carriage service providers to protect their networks and facilities against threats to national security from unauthorised access or interference
* a notification requirement, which requires carriers and nominated carriage service providers to tell Government of any proposed changes to their telecommunications systems or services that are likely to have a material adverse effect on their capacity to comply with their security obligation
* the ability for Government to obtain more detailed information from carriers and carriage service providers in certain circumstances to support the work of the Critical Infrastructure Centre, and
* the ability for Government to intervene and issue directions in cases in cases where there are significant national security concerns that cannot be addressed through other means.

==Role in Internet content regulation==
In 2000, a legislative framework for online content regulation was established by adding a new schedule (schedule 5) to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The Australian Broadcasting Authority was responsible for managing and enforcing the framework, and this responsibility passed to ACMA in 2005. 

The key element to the framework was the establishment of a complaints mechanism under Part 4 of the Schedule. Members of the public could complain to ACMA about offensive material online, ACMA could investigate, and then notify Internet service providers to prevent access to prohibited content. The framework also permitted ACMA to initiate an &#x27;own-motion&#x27; investigation into potentially prohibited content. The framework was designed to be consistent with the national classifications system (the Code and Classification Guidelines established by the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995). Through this mechanism of establishing what content is prohibited or possibly prohibited, ACMA effectively creates a &quot;blacklist&quot; of content to which Internet service providers must deny users access.

This framework was amended further in 2007 by the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Act (2007) as Schedule 5 only applied to stored content made available over the Internet but did not apply easily to &quot;ephemeral&quot; content such as streamed material. A new schedule (schedule 7) was introduced to regulate this content consistently with the national classifications system.

On 10 March 2009, the ACMA issued an &quot;interim link-deletion notice&quot; to Bulletproof Networks, an Australian web-hosting company, on the grounds that Whirlpool, a customer of Bulletproof Networks, posted a link to a blacklisted, anti-abortion web site. There was a controversy that the material hosted by Whirlpool was the response notification from ACMA stating that the website had been blacklisted (the notice included the address of the website that had been blacklisted). 

===ACMA blacklist leaked===
On 19 March 2009 it was reported that the ACMA&#x27;s blacklist of banned sites had been leaked online, and had been published by WikiLeaks. Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, obtained the blacklist after the ACMA blocked several WikiLeaks pages following their publication of the Danish blacklist. Assange said that &quot;This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring WikiLeaks.&quot; Three lists purporting to be from the ACMA were published online over a seven-day period.

The leaked list, which was reported to have been obtained from a manufacturer of internet filtering software, contained 2395 sites. Approximately half of the sites on the list were not related to child pornography, and included online gambling sites, YouTube pages, gay, straight, and fetish pornography sites, Wikipedia entries, euthanasia sites, websites of fringe religions, Christian sites, and even the websites of a tour operator and a Queensland dentist. Colin Jacobs, spokesman for lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia, said that there was no mechanism for a site operator to know they got onto the list or to request to be removed from it. Australia&#x27;s Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy later blamed the addition of the dentist&#x27;s website to the blacklist on the &quot;Russian mob&quot;.

Associate professor Bjorn Landfeldt of the University of Sydney said that the leaked list &quot;constitutes a condensed encyclopedia of depravity and potentially very dangerous material&quot;. Stephen Conroy said the list was not the real blacklist and described its leak and publication as &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot; and that it undermined efforts to improve &quot;cyber safety&quot;. He said that ACMA was investigating the incident and considering a range of possible actions including referral to the Australian Federal Police, and that Australians involved in making the content available would be at &quot;serious risk of criminal prosecution&quot;.

Conroy initially denied that the list published on WikiLeaks and the ACMA blacklist were the same, saying &quot;This is not the ACMA blacklist.&quot; He stated that the leaked list was alleged to be current on 6 August 2008 and contained 2,400 URLs, where the ACMA blacklist for the same date contained 1,061 URLs. He added that the ACMA advised that there were URLs on the leaked list that had never been the subject of a complaint or ACMA investigation, and had never been included on the ACMA blacklist. He was backed up by ISP Tech 2U, one of six ISPs involved in filtering technology trials.

Conroy&#x27;s denial was called into doubt by the Internet Industry Association (IIA), who publicly condemned the publishing of the list, chief executive Peter Coroneos saying, &quot;No reasonable person could countenance the publication of links which promote access to child abuse images, irrespective of their motivation, which in this case appears to be political.&quot;

Conroy later claimed the leaked blacklist published on WikiLeaks closely resembled the official blacklist, admitting that the latest list (dated 18 March) &quot;seemed to be close&quot; to ACMA&#x27;s current blacklist.

In an estimates hearing of the Australian Federal Government on 25 May 2009 it was revealed that the leak was taken so seriously that it was referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. It was further stated that distribution of further updates to the list have been withheld until recipients can improve their security. Nerida O&#x27;Laughlin of the ACMA confirmed that the list has been reviewed and as of 30 April consists of 997 URLs.

===Online Safety Act 2021===
In 2021, Schedules 5 and 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 were repealed as part of the enactment of the Online Safety Act 2021. This Act established the eSafety Commissioner (section 26) and, under part 3 of the Act, gave the Commissioner responsibility for managing and enforcing the online content scheme (part 9).

<doc id="553722" wikidata="Q1102436" url="?curid=553722" title="Closed shop">
<text>A pre-entry closed shop (or simply closed shop) is a form of union security agreement under which the employer agrees to hire union members only, and employees must remain members of the union at all times to remain employed. This is different from a post-entry closed shop (US: union shop), which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members. In a union shop, the union must accept as a member any person hired by the employer. By comparison, an open shop does not require union membership of potential and current employees.

International Labour Organization covenants do not address the legality of closed shop provisions, leaving the question up to each individual nation. The legal status of closed shop agreements varies widely from country to country, ranging from bans on the agreement, to extensive regulation of the agreement to not mentioning it at all.

==Legal status==

===United Kingdom===
Dunn and Gennard found 111 UK cases of dismissals on the introduction of a closed shop, involving 325 individuals, and they stated, &quot;While proponents of the closed shop may argue that an estimated minimum 325 dismissals is a relatively small number compared with the total population covered by closed shops, critics would see the figure as substantial arguing that one dismissal is one too many&quot;. In relation to the pre-entry closed shop, they stated, &quot;Its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; is to exclude people from jobs by denying them union membership&quot;. 
All forms of closed shops in the UK are illegal following the introduction of the Employment Act 1990. They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52) passed by the Conservative government at the time. The Labour Party, then in opposition, had supported closed shops until December 1989, when it abandoned the policy in accordance with European legislation. Equity was one of the last trade unions in the United Kingdom to offer a pre-entry closed shop until the 1990 act.

The famous English tort law case of &quot;Rookes v Barnard&quot; concerned a closed shop agreement.

===United States===
The Taft–Hartley Act outlawed the closed shop in the United States in 1947. The union shop was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. States with right-to-work laws go further by not allowing employers to require employees to pay a form of union dues, called an agency fee. An employer may not lawfully agree with a union to hire only union members, but it may agree to require employees to join the union or pay the equivalent of union dues to it within a set period after starting employment. Similarly, a union could require an employer that had agreed to a closed shop contract prior to 1947 to fire an employee who had been expelled from the union for any reason, but it cannot demand an employer to fire an employee under a union shop contract for any reason other than failure to pay dues that are required by all employees.

The US government does not permit union shops in any federal agency, regardless of state laws.

Construction unions and unions in other industries with similar employment patterns have coped with the prohibition of closed shops by using exclusive hiring halls as a means of controlling the supply of labor. Such exclusive hiring halls do not strictly and formally require union membership as a condition of employment, but they do so in practical terms since an employee seeking to be dispatched to work through the union&#x27;s hiring hall must pay union dues or a roughly-equivalent hiring hall fee. If the hiring hall is run on a non-discriminatory basis and adheres to clearly-stated eligibility and dispatch standards, it is lawful.

The Taft–Hartley Act also prohibits unions from requiring unreasonably-high initiation fees as a condition of membership to prevent unions from using initiation fees as a device to keep non-union employees out of a particular industry. Also, the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter pre-hire agreements in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union. The NLRA prohibits pre-hire agreements outside the construction industry.

For the entertainment industry, unions representing performers have as their most important rule banning any represented performer from working on any non-union production. Penalties are imposed on the union member, not the employer, and can lead to loss of union membership. Most major productions are union productions, and non-members join SAG-AFTRA, the country&#x27;s main union of actors and performing artists, by performing as extras and earning three union vouchers or by being given a speaking line and entering that way. The other performance unions do not have minimum membership standards, but those who join them are prohibited from working on non-union productions. 

===Canada===
The status of closed shops varies from province to province within Canada. The Supreme Court has ruled that Section Two of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed both the freedom to associate and the freedom not to associate, but employees in a work-environment largely dominated by a union were beneficiaries of union policies and so should pay union fees, regardless of membership status. However, religious and conscientious objectors were allowed the option of paying the amount to a registered charity instead.

===Australia===
All forms of closed shops in the Commonwealth are illegal under federal workplace laws. Discriminating against an employee, or prospective employee, due to their status as a union, or non-union, member is considered an &quot;adverse action&quot; and is hence illegal under S.342 of the &quot;Fair Work Act 2009&quot;.

<doc id="553731" wikidata="Q7101090" url="?curid=553731" title="Oregon Ballot Measures 47 and 50">
<text>Ballot Measure 47 was an initiative in the U.S. state of Oregon that passed in 1996, affecting the assessment of property taxes and instituting a double majority provision for tax legislation. Measure 50 was a revised version of the law, which also passed, after being referred to the voters by the 1997 state legislature.

Measure 47, sometimes referred to as a &quot;cut and cap&quot; law, reduced property taxes to the lesser of the 1994–95 tax or the 1995–96 tax minus 10 percent and limited future increases in assessed property values, except for new construction or additions, to 3 percent per year. It also instituted a &quot;double majority&quot; rule requiring at least a 50-percent voter turnout for all local tax measures in most elections (partially repealed in 2008 by Measure 56). It strengthened state constitutional limits, first imposed by Measure 5, on property taxes on real estate.

Measure 47 was placed on the ballot by initiative petition by anti-tax activist Bill Sizemore and approved by voters in the November 1996 general election, with 704,554 votes in favor and 642,613 votes against.

The law enacted by Measure 47 was amended in 1997, when the Oregon Legislative Assembly referred Measure 50 to voters to clarify that Measure 47 was intended to limit increases in real-estate assessments to 3 percent per year. The measure passed.

== Measure 47 ==
The measure was sponsored by Bill Sizemore and his Oregon Taxpayers United anti-tax group, as part of the Oregon tax revolt. Proponents were upset by rising property taxes, largely caused by increasing real-estate values in the Portland area. Proponents were concerned about levy elections when there was little awareness of issues and turnout was expected to be low. Under Oregon law, two regularly scheduled statewide elections, the primary election in May and the general election in November, are held in every even-numbered year. In addition, four regularly scheduled elections can be held at the local level every year. Beyond this, the legislature may call a special election at any time.

Opponents feared that reducing taxes would cause cuts to schools beyond those they blamed on Measure 5. Furthermore, they opposed the double majority rule, arguing it gave non-voters more political power than those willing to vote.

Confusion existed about the possible effects of Measure 47. Petitioners claimed that Measure 47 would cap the assessment of properties—the value of the property as determined by the county—to prevent taxes from being raised more than three percent annually. Others claimed that Measure 47 did not prevent such an action. Sizemore placed an argument in the Oregon voters&#x27; guide in an attempt to clarify the measure&#x27;s provisions.
Nonetheless, the legislature sent Measure 50 to voters the next year to clarify that the cap applied to the assessed value of the property as well.

=== Double majority rule ===
Measure 47 enacted Oregon&#x27;s &quot;double majority&quot; rule, which placed an additional requirement on state and local tax levies. The rule applies to all elections besides general elections held in even-numbered years. For a levy initiative or referral to pass in other elections, not only do more voters have to vote &quot;yes&quot; than &quot;no&quot;, but at least 50 percent of registered voters must vote in the election. The double majority is a type of supermajority similar to an absolute majority.

In the U.S., general elections include presidential elections, held in even-numbered years once every four years on Election Day, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. General elections also include midterm elections in which members of Congress, state legislators, and some state governors are chosen on Election Day in the years midway between presidential elections.

Since the passage of Measure 47, the double majority requirement has caused the defeat of many proposed local tax levies. According to the League of Oregon Cities, between 1997 and 2007 of the 1,358 total tax measures on ballots in the state, 616 passed and 742 failed, and 169 of those failures resulted from the double majority rule.
In response, local governments generally prefer placing such measures on general-election ballots.

The measure also led to attempts to clean up the voter registration rolls. Registered voters who had died or moved away were being counted as &quot;No&quot; votes with the double majority requirement. (By law, Oregon ballot measures are worded so that &quot;No&quot; means &quot;no change&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot; means &quot;adopt the measure.&quot;)

In 1998, Measure 53 sought to reverse the double majority provision but won only 49 percent of the vote.

In 2007, activists representing schools, the public employee union, and business interests lobbied the Oregon Legislative Assembly to scale back the requirement, and by June 2007 both houses of the legislature had approved House Joint Resolution 15, putting a measure before the voters on the November 2008 ballot. This measure appeared as Measure 56, and would exempt elections held in May and November of any year from the double majority requirement. It was later passed by voters on November 4, 2008. Proponents of the measure called the double majority rule undemocratic because, in their view, the rule gave non-voters unfair influence in the democratic process by allowing them to make measures fail that otherwise won support among the majority of those who actually voted. They also argued that because of Oregon&#x27;s exclusive vote-by-mail voting system, which makes it more convenient to vote, there is no reason for people not to vote.
Opponents considered unfair the idea that a small percentage of people could impose new taxes on others. They argued that the double majority rule was necessary to keep this from happening, and claimed that if it were repealed, taxes would rise too much.

== Measure 50 ==
Measure 50 was sent to the voters by the Oregon Legislature in 1997. Once passed by the voters, the measure replaced Measure 47. The problems with Measure 47 that Measure 50 aimed to address included a lack of precision about the assessment of property taxes, unintended consequences, and vulnerability to legal challenges.

Measure 50 was approved by voters in the May 20, 1997 special election, with 429,943 votes in favor, and 341,781 votes against.

After the passage of Measure 47, as part of the ongoing anti-tax movement in Oregon, there was some confusion as to how the measure would be interpreted by the courts. One interpretation had the ballot measure reducing property tax revenues by $458 million in the fiscal year 1997–1998, while another interpretation, provided by the Oregon Attorney General, had it providing a reduction of only $270 million. Much of this disagreement had to do with what limitations Measure 47 would place on increases in the assessment of a property&#x27;s value.

Measure 50 limited the adjustments in property tax assessments. Proponents argued that Measure 50 was necessary to avoid a lengthy legal battle as well as budget uncertainty about the possible effects of Measure 47. Opponents argued that Measure 50, rather than being a re-write of 47, was an attempt to water down the limitations imposed by Measure 47. Indeed, the estimated financial impact of Measure 50 was a $361 million reduction, rather than Measure 47&#x27;s intended $458 million reduction.

<text>Robert Klein (born February 8, 1942) is an American stand-up comedian, singer, and actor. He is known for his appearances on stage and screen. He has released four standup comedy albums: &quot;A Child of the 50s&quot; (1973), &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; (1974), &quot;New Teeth&quot; (1975), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Not Make Love&quot; (1990). The first two albums received Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album nominations. Klein hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in its first season in 1975 and again in 1978. Klein made his Broadway debut in the 1966 production of &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; opposite Alan Alda. He earned a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical nomination for his performance in Neil Simon&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot; (1979). He also starred on his own show, &quot;Robert Klein Time&quot;, which aired on USA Network from 1986 to 1988.

He is known for his film roles in &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot; (1994), &quot;One Fine Day&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; (2001), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; (2003), and &quot;Reign Over Me&quot; (2007). He is also known for his recurring television roles in &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; (2009–2012), &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2013–2014), &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; (2014) and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (2018–2019). He has received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his specials, &quot;Child in his 50&#x27;s&quot; (2001), and &quot;Unfair and Unbalanced&quot; (2010). He was profiled in the Starz documentary &quot;Robert Klein Still Can&#x27;t Stop His Leg&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Klein was born in the Bronx, the son of Frieda (née Moskowitz) and Benjamin Klein, and was raised in a &quot;prototypical 1950s Bronx Jewish&quot; environment, the grandson of Hungarian-Jewish immigrants who arrived in the USA early in the 20th century. He has an older sister, Rhoda.

After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School, Klein had planned to study medicine; however, he changed his mind during his studies at Alfred University, deciding to go into acting instead.

While studying at the Yale Drama School, Klein learned about an opportunity to audition for The Second City. In a piece he wrote for the improvisational &#x27;s book, Klein recalled sitting in a room full of other hopefuls, including Fred Willard. Klein&#x27;s audition consisted of an improvisation set with Willard about two guys in a nightclub, which was successful enough to get Klein and Willard hired by Second City. In the spring of 1965, Klein was chosen as a member of Second City. When he returned to New York City a year later, he was cast by Mike Nichols in the Broadway musical &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work===
Klein&#x27;s first major appearance was as host of the 1970 summer replacement television series &quot;Comedy Tonight&quot;, on which were introduced many of the routines that in the next few years would be released on record albums. His extensive routines about the Watergate scandal made him highly popular in the 1970s. In 1974, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot;.

Klein starred in HBO&#x27;s first stand-up comedy special in 1975 during the cable channel&#x27;s early broadcast days and has continued to appear in several more one-man shows which have typically concluded with his &quot;I can&#x27;t stop my leg&quot; routine. On November 15, 1975, during season one, and again in season three, on January 28, 1978, Klein hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. His skits included &quot;Tough Director&quot; in 1975, &quot;Nick The Lounge Singer Sings Star Wars Theme&quot; in 1978 and &quot;The Olympia Restaurant: Cheeseburger, Chips and Pepsi&quot; in 1978.

In 1979, Klein starred in Neil Simon&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot; opposite Lucie Arnaz. He received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical nomination.

In 1985, he starred in the &quot;Wordplay&quot; segment of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, which cast him against type in a dramatic role. In 1986, Klein had his own late-night talk show, &quot;Robert Klein Time&quot;, which ran on the USA Network until 1988. The following year, Klein hosted &quot;Monty Python Live at Aspen&quot;, a reunion and tribute show for the five surviving members of the British comedy troupe, in a special that appeared on HBO in 1998.

=== Comedy albums ===
Klein has released four comedy albums, &quot;A Child of the Fifties&quot; (1973), &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; (1974), &quot;New Teeth&quot; (1975), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Not Make Love&quot; (1990). The first two albums received Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album nominations.

In &quot;A Child of the Fifties&quot; (1973, Brut/Buddah Records), shown as &quot;Child of the 50s&quot; (on the cover), Klein talks about his life as a child in the 1950s: about air raid drills, Johnny Mathis music, showing off condoms while at the high school dance, the high school lunch ladies, Senator Joseph McCarthy, Governor W. Averell Harriman (of New York), meeting Yankee stars, the Yankees losing the World Series, and much more. He also goes into other things that he has observed in his life, such as substitute teaching, 1970s FM radio disc jockeys, late-night delicatessens, and annoying commercials (e.g., Geritol). He also performed two songs that he wrote himself: &quot;Fabulous &#x27;50s&quot; and &quot;Middle Class, Educated Blues.&quot;

His next album, &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; (1974), included extensive discussion of the Watergate scandal and another song—the title track—about a kid who turned to humor to become popular.

Klein&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;New Teeth&quot; (1975, Epic/CBS Records), featured the comedian&#x27;s on-stage work on tracks such as &quot;Mother Isn&#x27;t Always Right&quot; and his transposition of George Carlin&#x27;s &quot;Seven Words You Can&#x27;t Say On Television,&quot; titled &quot;Six Clean Words You Can Say Anywhere,&quot; with studio-recorded material such as &quot;Continental Steel&quot; and &quot;On the Bayou.&quot;

Klein responded to the end of the sexual revolution with his 1990 album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Not Make Love&quot;, which contained many of the same routines as his 1984 HBO special &quot;Child of the &#x27;50s, Man of the &#x27;80s&quot; and his 1986 special &quot;Robert Klein on Broadway&quot;.

Klein has appeared in such films as &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978), &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; (1982), &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (1994), &quot;One Fine Day&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; (2001), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; (2003), and &quot;Ira and Abby&quot; (2006). Klein had a recurring role in the TV drama series &quot;Sisters&quot;. In the 1970s, he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; twice. He also appeared as a guest star in the animated series &quot;Duckman&quot;, in the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;, and on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;.

In 2005 he launched The Amorous Busboy of Decatur Avenue, his 8th HBO Special

In March 2007, Klein once again collaborated with Adam Sandler (after appearing in &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;) in &quot;Reign Over Me&quot;, and in September 2007 released a new DVD compilation of his eight live HBO specials, entitled &quot;Robert Klein: The HBO Specials 1975–2005&quot;. Klein starred in &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot;, a crime dramedy on NBC starring Debra Messing. In this series he played the father of the show&#x27;s main character, Laura. He appeared alongside Messing again in the relaunched version of her sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, playing the father of her character, Grace Adler. In 2014, Klein played the Canadian Ambassador on &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;. Klein played the Mayor of New York City in &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot; (2014) and &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot; (2015).

In 2018, Klein played Grace Adler&#x27;s father Martin in the NBC revival of &quot;Will and Grace&quot; replacing Alan Arkin. Klein has authored an autobiography, &quot;The Amorous Busboy of Decatur Avenue: A Child of the Fifties Looks Back&quot; (2006).

==Personal life==
Klein is divorced from opera singer Brenda Boozer. They have a son, Alexander Stuart Klein, who goes by Allie Klein and performs standup comedy.

==Influence==
Klein has named Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Winters, and Rodney Dangerfield as comedy influences.

Jerry Seinfeld has stated Klein&#x27;s influences on him stating &quot;He was &quot;The Beatles&quot; of Comedy to me.&quot; Various comedians including Bill Maher, Billy Crystal, Richard Lewis, and Jay Leno, all have also cited Klein as a comedic influence.

<doc id="553741" wikidata="Q5773169" url="?curid=553741" title="Histone octamer">
<text>In molecular biology, a histone octamer is the eight-protein complex found at the center of a nucleosome core particle. It consists of two copies of each of the four core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The octamer assembles when a tetramer, containing two copies of H3 and two of H4, complexes with two H2A/H2B dimers. Each histone has both an N-terminal tail and a C-terminal histone-fold. Each of these key components interacts with DNA in its own way through a series of weak interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. These interactions keep the DNA and the histone octamer loosely associated, and ultimately allow the two to re-position or to separate entirely.

== History of research==

Histone post-translational modifications were first identified and listed as having a potential regulatory role on the synthesis of RNA in 1964. Since then, over several decades, chromatin theory has evolved. Chromatin subunit models as well as the notion of the nucleosome were established in 1973 and 1974, respectively. Richmond and his research group has been able to elucidate the crystal structure of the histone octamer with DNA wrapped up around it at a resolution of 7 Å in 1984. The structure of the octameric core complex was revisited seven years later and a resolution of 3.1 Å was elucidated for its crystal at a high salt concentration. Though sequence similarity is low between the core histones, each of the four have a repeated element consisting of a helix-loop-helix called the histone fold motif. Furthermore, the details of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions were fine-tuned by X-ray crystallography studies at 2.8 and 1.9 Å, respectively, in the 2000s.
==The histone octamer in molecular detail==

Core histones are four proteins called H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and they are all found in equal parts in the cell. All four of the core histone amino acid sequences contain between 20 and 24% of lysine and arginine and the size or the protein ranges between 11400 and 15400 daltons, making them relatively small, yet highly positively charged proteins. High content of positively charged amino acids allow them to closely associate with negatively charged DNA. Heterodimers, or histone-only intermediates are formed from histone-fold domains. The formation of histone only-intermediates proceeds when core histones are paired into the interlocked crescent shape quasi-symmetric heterodimer. Each histone fold domain is composed of 3 α-helix regions that are separated by disordered loops. The histone fold domain is responsible for formation of head-to-tail heterodimers of two histones: H2A-H2B and H3-H4. However, H3 and H4 histones first form a heterodimer and then in turn the heterodimer dimerizes to form a tetramer (H3-H4)2. The heterodimer formation is based on the interaction of hydrophobic amino acid residue interactions between the two proteins.

Quasi symmetry allows the heterodimer to be superimposed on itself by a 180 degree rotation around this symmetry axis. As a result of the rotation, two ends of histones involved in DNA binding of the crescent shape H3-H4 are equivalent, yet they organize different stretches of DNA. The H2A-H2B dimer also folds similarly. The (H3-H4)2 tetramer is wrapped with DNA around it as a first step of nucleosome formation. Then two H2A-H2B dimers are connected to the DNA-(H3-H4)2 complex to form a nucleosome.

Each of the four core histones, in addition to their histone-fold domains, also contain flexible, unstructured extensions called histone “tails”. Treatment of nucleosomes with protease trypsin indicates that after histone tails are removed, DNA is able to stay tightly bound to the nucleosome. Histone tails are subject to a wide array of modifications which includes phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation of serine, lysine and arginine residues.

==The histone octamer in the nucleosome==


The nucleosome core particle is the most basic form of DNA compaction in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of a histone octamer surrounded by 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped in a superhelical manner. In addition to compacting the DNA, the histone octamer plays a key role in the transcription of the DNA surrounding it. The histone octamer interacts with the DNA through both its core histone folds and N-terminal tails. The histone fold interacts chemically and physically with the DNA&#x27;s minor groove. Studies have found that the histones interact more favorably with A:T enriched regions than G:C enriched regions in the minor grooves. The N-terminal tails do not interact with a specific region of DNA but rather stabilize and guide the DNA wrapped around the octamer. The interactions between the histone octamer and DNA, however, are not permanent. The two can be separated quite easily and often are during replication and transcription. Specific remodeling proteins are constantly altering the chromatin structure by breaking the bonds between the DNA and nucleosome.

===Histone/DNA interactions===

Histones are composed of mostly positively charged amino acid residues such as lysine and arginine. The positive charges allow them to closely associate with the negatively charged DNA through electrostatic interactions. Neutralizing the charges in the DNA allows it to become more tightly packed.

====Interactions with the minor groove====

The histone-fold domains’ interaction with the minor groove accounts for the majority of the interactions in the nucleosome. As the DNA wraps around the histone octamer, it exposes its minor groove to the histone octamer at 14 distinct locations. At these sites, the two interact through a series of weak, non-covalent bonds. The main source of bonds comes from hydrogen bonds, both direct and water-mediated. The histone-fold hydrogen bonds with both phosphodiester backbone and the A:T rich bases. In these interactions, the histone fold binds to the oxygen atoms and hydroxyl side chains, respectively. Together these sites have a total of about 40 hydrogen bonds, most of which are from the backbone interactions. Additionally, 10 out of the 14 times that the minor groove faces the histone fold, an arginine side chain from the histone fold is inserted into the minor groove. The other four times, the arginine comes from a tail region of the histone.

====Tail interactions and modifications====

As mentioned above the histone tails have been shown to directly interact with the DNA of the nucleosome. Each histone in the octamer has an N-terminal tail that protrudes from the histone core. The tails play roles both in inter and intra nucleosomal interactions that ultimately influence gene access. Histones are positively charged molecules which allow a tighter bonding to the negatively charged DNA molecule. Reducing the positive charge of histone proteins reduces the strength of binding between the histone and DNA, making it more open to gene transcription (expression). Moreover, these flexible units direct DNA wrapping in a left-handed manner around the histone octamer during nucleosome formation. Once the DNA is bound the tails continue to interact with the DNA. The parts of the tail closest to the DNA hydrogen bond and strengthen the DNA&#x27;s association with the octamer; the parts of the tail furthest away from the DNA, however, work in a very different manner. Cellular enzymes modify the amino acids in the distal sections of the tail to influence the accessibility of the DNA. The tails have also been implicated in the stabilization of 30-nm fibers. Research has shown removing certain tails prevents the nucleosomes from forming properly and a general failure to produce chromatin fiber. In all, these associations protect the nucleosomal DNA from the external environment but also lower their accessibility to cellular replication and transcriptional machinery.

===Nucleosome remodeling and disassembly===

In order to access the nucleosomal DNA, the bonds between it and the histone octamer must be broken. This change takes place periodically in the cell as specific regions are transcribed, and it happens genome-wide during replication. Remodeling proteins work in three distinct ways: they can slide the DNA along the surface of the octamer, replace the one histone dimer with a variant, or remove the histone octamer entirely. No matter the method, in order to modify the nucleosomes, the remodeling complexes require energy from ATP hydrolysis to drive their actions.

Of the three techniques, sliding is the most common and least extreme. The basic premise of the technique is to free up a region of DNA that the histone octamer would normally tightly bind. While the technique is not well defined, the most prominent hypothesis is that the sliding is done in an “inchworm” fashion. In this method, using ATP as an energy source, the translocase domain of the nucleosome-remodeling complex detaches a small region of DNA from the histone octamer. This “wave” of DNA, spontaneously breaking and remaking the hydrogen bonds as it goes, then propagates down the nucleosomal DNA until it reaches the last binding site with the histone octamer. Once the wave reaches the end of the histone octamer the excess that was once at the edge is extended into the region of linker DNA. In total, one round of this method moves the histone octamer several base pairs in a particular direction—away from the direction the “wave” propagated.

==Clinical relevance==

Numerous reports show a link between age-related diseases, birth defects, and several types of cancer with disruption of certain histone post translational modifications. Studies have identified that N- and C-terminal tails are main targets for acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation. New evidence is pointing to several modifications within the histone core. Research is turning towards deciphering the role of these histone core modifications at the histone-DNA interface in the chromatin. p300 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP) possess histone acetyltransferase activity. p300 and CBP are the most promiscuous histone acetyltransferase enzymes acetylating all four core histones on multiple residues. Lysine 18 and Lysine 27 on H3 were the only histone acetylation sites reduced upon CBP and p300 depletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distinct roles of GCN5/PCAF-mediated H3K9ac and CBP/p300-mediated H3K18/27ac in nuclear receptor transactivation.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also, CBP and p300 knockout mice have an open neural tube defect and therefore die before birth. p300−/− embryos exhibit defective development of the heart. CBP+/− mice display growth retardation, craniofacial abnormalities, hematological malignancies, which are not observed in mice with p300+/−. Mutations of both p300 have been reported in human tumors such as colorectal, gastric, breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic carcinomas. Also, activation or localization of two histone acetyltransferases can be oncogenic.

<text>Richard Gurley Drew (June 22, 1899 – December 14, 1980) was an American inventor who worked for Johnson and Johnson, Permacel Co., and 3M in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he invented masking tape and cellophane tape.

==Biography==
When Drew joined 3M in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1921, it was a modest manufacturer of sandpaper. While testing their new Wetordry sandpaper at auto shops, Drew was intrigued to learn that the two-tone auto paintjobs so popular in the Roaring Twenties were difficult to manage at the border between the two colors. In response, after two years of work in 3M&#x27;s labs, Drew invented the first masking tape (1925), a two-inch-wide tan paper strip backed with a light, pressure-sensitive adhesive.

The first tape had adhesive along its edges but not in the middle. In its first trial run, it fell off the car and the frustrated auto painter growled at Drew, &quot;take this tape back to those Scotch bosses of yours and tell them to put more adhesive on it!&quot; (By &quot;Scotch&quot;, he meant &quot;cheap&quot;.) The nickname stuck, both to Drew&#x27;s improved masking tape, and to his 1930 invention, Scotch Brand cellulose tape.

In 1930 he came up with the world&#x27;s first transparent cellophane adhesive tape (called &quot;sellotape&quot; in the UK and &quot;Scotch tape&quot; in the United States). During the Great Depression, people began using Scotch tape to repair items rather than replace them. This was the beginning of 3M’s diversification into all manner of marketplaces and helped them to flourish in spite of the Great Depression.

Drew died in 1980 in Santa Barbara, California.

<doc id="553745" wikidata="Q5773163" url="?curid=553745" title="Histone fold">
<text>The histone fold is a structural motif located near the C-terminus of histone proteins, characterized by three alpha helices separated by two loops. This motif facilitates the formation of heterodimers, which subsequently assemble into a histone octamer, playing a crucial role in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes within chromatin. This fold is an ancient and highly conserved structural motif, essential for DNA compaction and regulation across a wide range of species.

== Discovery ==

The histone fold motif was first discovered in TATA box-binding protein-associated factors, which play a key role in transcription.

== Structure ==

The histone fold is typically around 70 amino acids long and is characterized by three alpha helices connected by two short, unstructured loops. In the absence of DNA, core histones assemble into head-to-tail intermediates. For instance, H3 and H4 first form heterodimers, which then combine to form a tetramer. Similarly, H2A and H2B form heterodimers. These interactions occur through hydrophobic &quot;handshake&quot; interactions between histone fold domains. 

Histones H4 and H2A can form internucleosomal contacts that, when acetylated, enable ionic interactions between peptides. These interactions can alter the surrounding internucleosomal contacts, leading to chromatin opening and increased accessibility for transcription.

== Function ==

The histone fold plays a crucial role in nucleosome formation by mediating interactions between histones. The largest interface surfaces are found in the heterotypic dimer interactions of H3-H4 and H2A-H2B. These interactions are primarily mediated by the &quot;handshake&quot; motif between histone fold domains. Additionally, the H2A structure has a unique loop modification at its interface, contributing to its distinct role in transcriptional activation.

== Evolution ==

The histone fold is thought to have evolved from ancestral peptide sets that formed helix-strand-helix motifs. These peptides are believed to have originated from ancient fragments, which may be precursors to the modern H3-H4 tetramer found in eukaryotes. Notably, archaeal single-chain histones, similar to eukaryotic histones, are found in the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, suggesting a shared ancestry between eukaryotes and archaea, with possible lateral gene transfers to bacteria.

Studies on species like Drosophila have revealed variations in the histone fold motif, particularly in the subunits of transcription initiation factors. These proteins contain histone-like structures, which show that the histone fold motif can also be found in non-histone proteins involved in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

<doc id="553747" wikidata="Q202740" url="?curid=553747" title="Mercedes-Benz R-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz R-Class is a mid-size luxury MPV introduced by Mercedes-Benz in 2005 for the 2006 model year. Following the success of the smaller A- and B-Class MPVs, Mercedes in collaboration with coachbuilder Stola presented a concept vehicle, Vision GST (&quot;Grand Sports Tourer&quot;), at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show and a second one, Vision R presented at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show, subsequently introducing the production version at 2005 New York International Auto Show. The R-Class was manufactured in Vance, Alabama until 2015 when its production was shifted to Mishawaka, Indiana for a smaller volume production until 2017.

The R-Class (W251) shared its platform with the M-Class (W164) and GL-Class (X164) and was available in two wheelbase lengths: standard and long . The R-Class was sold in the United States and Canada in long wheelbase only. The R-Class in both standard and long wheelbases were sold internationally until the end of 2013 with exception of China where R 320 and R 400 with long wheelbase continued to be sold until 2017.

==Updates==

===2007 changes===
Mercedes-Benz announced in May 2007 that the R-Class model range would be expanded with more engine options and availability of rear-wheel-drive system for selected models in addition to 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system. A new smaller 3.0-litre V6 was available in both petrol and diesel versions. The seating options became more flexible, offering five, six, or seven seats. AMG styling option was added to the extensive list of standard and extra-cost options.

===2010 changes===
The R-Class received a major update with facelift to the front and rear fascias, grille, side mirrors, and taillights for the model year 2011. The revised model was unveiled at the 2010 New York International Auto Show.

At the same time, the new 5.5-litre V8 motor was introduced to R-Class for the first time since the last R-Class with V8 motors, R 500 and R 63 AMG, were withdrawn from the market in 2007. The reintroduced R 500 was not offered in the North American market. The North American market continued with R 350 4MATIC and R 350 BlueTEC 4MATIC, both in long wheelbase form and with V6 engines only, for 2011 and 2012.

==R 63 AMG 4MATIC==

The AMG version of the W251, R 63 AMG 4MATIC, was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show as a 2007 model. It featured a handbuilt 6.2-litre M156 E 63 V8 engine producing and of torque. The R 63 AMG was equipped with same engine, seven-speed AMG Speedshift 7G-TRONIC, and 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system from ML 63 AMG and GL 63 AMG. The driver can manually select the gears by pressing the upshift and downshift buttons placed behind the steering wheel spokes if desired. No rear-wheel-drive option was offered in R 63 AMG 4MATIC. The top speed is electronically restricted to or with optional extra-charge AMG Driver&#x27;s Package. Despite its heavy weight, the acceleration was brisk with time of 4.6 seconds.

A high performance version of R-Class wasn&#x27;t well-received due to its poor handling dynamics, especially with the heavy V8 engine. With 200 units built for the worldwide sale, this model was the rarest of R-Class and amongst the rarest AMG models. Due to extremely low sales and the lack of advertisement, R 63 AMG was withdrawn from the market in 2007, making it a single model year.

==Chinese market==
From 2014 to 2017, the long wheelbase R-Class was sold in China only with one engine option in two different power outputs: R 320 4MATIC and R 400 4MATIC. The R-Class enjoyed a steady popularity in China with annual sales between 12,000 and 14,000 units per year. Due to its small sales volume, the production was shifted from Alabama to Indiana where the R-Class for Chinese market was assembled by contract manufacturer AM General from 2015 to 2017.

==Technical data==
===Powertrains===
The entry with (Long) in parenthesie denotes availability in both standard and long wheelbases. Otherwise, the entry shows the standard wheelbase only. The Long without parentheses denotes long-wheelbase version only. The asterisk next to the figures denotes the long-wheelbase R-Class. The double asterisk denotes the optional extra-cost AMG Driver&#x27;s Package.

*R 500 was sold with 5.5L in the U.S., Canada as the R 550.

===Transmissions===
All models except for R 350 4MATIC BlueEFFICIENCY, R 400 4MATIC, R 300 CDI BlueEfficiency, and R 350 BlueTEC 4MATIC use seven-speed &quot;7G-TRONIC&quot; automatic transmissions. The latter four models use seven-speed &quot;7G-TRONIC plus&quot; automatic transmission.

==Safety and security==
The R-Class scored &quot;Good&quot; in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) front crash test but &quot;Acceptable&quot; in the side impact crash test due to the excessive load against the dummy&#x27;s torso. After modifying the seatbelts and interior door trim for the 2009 model year, the IIHS rated the R-class &quot;Good&quot; overall in side impacts allowing the R-Class to receive the &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award.

In the United Kingdom, Thatcham Research&#x27;s New Car Whiplash Ratings (NCWR) tested the R-Class and awarded it the top &quot;Good&quot; rating overall for its ability to protect occupants against whiplash injuries. Thatcham Research&#x27;s New Vehicle Security Ratings (NVSR) awarded R-Class with five out of five stars for vehicular theft deterrent and four out of five stars for breaking-in deterrent.

==Sales==
Mercedes targeted 50,000 sales per year, half of those for the North American market. While the initial strong sales of first two model years, 2006 and 2007, the sales fell in 2008 following the recession, reaching less than ten percent of ML-Class sales. Sales continued downward, and R-Class was discontinued in 2012 for the North American market and in 2013 for Europe and other markets — with exception of China where R-Class enjoyed popularity. Mercedes-Benz Metris introduced in 2014 is considered a successor to the R-Class for the North American market.

In Germany, the limited engine choices and lack of available rear-wheel-drive option at the launch led to slow sales with almost 4,500 units sold in 2006. The sales decline followed for a few years despite adding more engine choices and rear-wheel-drive option. The 2011 mid-cycle refresh increased the sales to almost 2,500 before dropping to less than 500 units for the final model year, 2013.

The cause of its poor sales performance is hard to attribute, considering a multitude of possible reasons. One is the confusing marketing of what the R-Class is: Mercedes-Benz tried to persuade customers that the R-Class represented a new category of luxury passenger vehicle with the attribution of station wagon/estate, crossover, SUV, and van rolled into one. Additionally, Mercedes-Benz initially marketed the R-Class as a &quot;Sports Cruiser&quot; and later as a &quot;Family Tourer&quot;. It also suffered from the &quot;image problem&quot; caused by the ill-fated Chrysler Pacifica that looked too similar to the R-Class and was similarly sized despite the R-Class having more luxury features and a better managed launch. The Chrysler Division of its parent company, DaimlerChrysler, had introduced the Pacifica two years prior to the R-Class, and the Pacifica was plagued with production and quality issues as well as poor marketing and few engine choices. Secondly, the customer preference had shifted away from MPV minivans and vans to CUV&#x27;s and SUV&#x27;s during the late 2000s and most of the 2010s. Thirdly, the Great Recession of 2008-2009 greatly impacted automotive sales and consumer confidence along with a strong increase in fuel prices, making the R-Class less desirable due to its higher fuel consumption.

The mid-cycle refresh didn&#x27;t help with sales at all despite an updated fascia appearance more in line with the M-Class and GL-Class and a better interior.

<text>Fulcher of Chartres ( in or near Chartres – after 1128; ; ) was a priest who participated in the First Crusade. He served Baldwin I of Jerusalem for many years and wrote a Latin chronicle of the Crusade.

==Life==
Fulcher was born . His appointment as chaplain of Baldwin of Boulogne in 1097 suggests that he had been trained as a priest, most likely at the school of Chartres. However, he was probably not a member of the cathedral chapter, since he is not named in the listing of the &quot;Dignitaries of the Church of Our Lady of Chartres&quot;.

The details of the Council of Clermont of 1095, in his history, suggest he attended the council personally, or knew someone who did; perhaps Ivo, Bishop of Chartres, who influenced Fulcher&#x27;s opinions on Church reform and the investiture controversy with the Holy Roman Empire.

Fulcher was part of the entourage of Count Stephen II of Blois and Duke Robert Curthose of Normandy which made its way through southern France and Italy in 1096, crossing into the Eastern Roman Empire from Bari and arriving in Constantinople in 1097, where they joined with the other armies of the First Crusade. He travelled through Asia Minor to Marash, shortly before the army&#x27;s arrival at Antioch in 1097, where he was appointed chaplain to Baldwin of Boulogne. He followed his new lord after Baldwin split off from the main army, to Edessa, where Baldwin founded the county of Edessa.

After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 Fulcher and Baldwin travelled to the city to complete their pilgrimage. When Baldwin became king of Jerusalem in 1100, Fulcher came with him to Jerusalem and continued as his chaplain until Baldwin died in 1118.

Fulcher accompanied King Baldwin at the Battle of Ramla in 1101, ministering to the king before the battle. He described the battle, &quot;the number of foe was so great they swarmed over us so quickly that hardly anyone could see or recognize anyone else.&quot; Although the Crusaders were routed at first, Baldwin committed his reserves and lead the counter charge himself and defeated the Muslim force.

At that time, Fulcher may have been serving as Prior at the Mount of Olives. After 1115 he was the canon of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, possibly attached to the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre, and was probably responsible for the relics and treasures in the church. Fulcher was a resident of Jerusalem at least through 1127, but nothing further is known of him.

==Chronicle==
Fulcher wrote his chronicle of the Crusade &quot;Gesta Francorum Iherusalem Peregrinantium&quot; (A history of the expedition to Jerusalem) in three books. He started writing it in 1101 and finished around 1128. The chronicle is considered among the best records of the crusade. Included in the chronicle is his account of Pope Urban II&#x27;s November 1095 speech at the Council of Clermont where Urban calls for the First Crusade:
[Your] brethren who live in the east are in urgent need of your help, and you must hasten to give them the aid which has often been promised them. For, as the most of you have heard, the Turks and Arabs have attacked them and have conquered the territory of Romania [the Greek empire] as far west as the shore of the Mediterranean and the Hellespont, which is called the Arm of St. George. They have occupied more and more of the lands of those Christians, and have overcome them in seven battles. They have killed and captured many, and have destroyed the churches and devastated the empire. If you permit them to continue thus for awhile with impurity, the faithful of God will be much more widely attacked by them. 

At the earliest, Fulcher began his chronicle in the late autumn of 1100, or at the latest in the spring of 1101, in a version that has not survived but which was transmitted to Europe during his lifetime. This version was completed around 1106 and was used as a source by Guibert of Nogent, a contemporary of Fulcher in Europe.

He began his work at the urging of his travelling companions, who probably included Baldwin I. He had at least one library in Jerusalem at his disposal, from which he had access to letters and other documents of the crusade. In this library the &quot;Historia Francorum&quot; of Raymond of Aguilers and the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; must also have been available, which served as sources for much of the specific information in Fulcher&#x27;s work that he did not personally witness.

Fulcher divided his chronicle into three books. Book I described the preparations for the First Crusade in Clermont in 1095 up to the conquest of Jerusalem and the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by Godfrey of Bouillon. It included an enthusiastic description of Constantinople. The second book described the deeds of Baldwin I, who succeeded Godfrey and was king of Jerusalem from 1100 to 1118. The third and final book reported on the life of king Baldwin II, until 1127 when there was a plague in Jerusalem, during which Fulcher apparently died. The second and third books were written from around 1109 to 1115, and from 1118 to 1127, compiled into a second edition by Fulcher himself.

Fulcher&#x27;s work was used by many other chroniclers who lived after him. William of Tyre and William of Malmesbury used part of the chronicle as a source. His chronicle is generally accurate, though not entirely so. It was published in the &quot;Recueil des historiens des croisades&quot; and the Patrologia Latina, and a critical edition of the Latin version was published by Heinrich Hagenmeyer in 1913.

<text>Adam Donovan Sessler (born August 29, 1973) is an American video game journalist, television personality and consultant. He is best known as the host for the video game review series &quot;Xplay&quot; and the editor-in-chief for G4&#x27;s video game section. Upon his departure from G4 in April 2012, Sessler was its longest-tenured television personality, having originally been hired by its predecessor ZDTV in 1998.

After his departure from G4, Sessler became the editor-in-chief and content producer for Rev3Games. He left video game journalism in 2014 to become the president of TheoryHead, a consultancy firm for entertainment and media. In 2021, Adam Sessler was announced as a returning On-Air Talent and staff of the relaunched G4 television network.

== Background ==
Sessler was born in El Cerrito, California, and graduated from El Cerrito High School in 1991. He graduated from UCLA with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature. He was previously a credit analyst for ABN-AMRO in San Francisco, and an actor on the San Francisco Public-access television show &quot;Chip Weigh Magnet Down&quot;, which he also helped to make. Sessler admitted that he was grateful to no longer work for Fortune 500 companies, saying in &quot;The X-Play Insider&#x27;s Guide to Gaming&quot; that he was &quot;very sad&quot; about the job. Sessler currently lives in San Francisco, California, with his wife Amber.

Some of Sessler&#x27;s favorite game series are the &quot;Halo&quot; series for its first-person shooter qualities; the Japanese version of &quot;Rez&quot; for its Trance Vibrator peripheral; the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Rayman&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, and &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; series for their unique platform qualities. In 2010, Sessler stated his top five games of the decade were, in order of release: &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;, &quot;Fable II&quot;, and &quot;Uncharted 2&quot;. He also stated that &quot;Uncharted 2&quot; was his favorite single-player experience of all time. In his review of &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, he stated that it is in the &quot;rarefied company of titles like &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and &quot;Uncharted 2&quot;&quot;, intimating it to be a new personal favorite. Likewise, he has recently expressed affinity towards titles such as &quot;Gone Home&quot;, &quot;The Last of Us&quot; (calling it one of the finest games he&#x27;s ever played), and &quot;L.A. Noire&quot; (referring to it as a &quot;watershed moment in gaming&quot;).

Sessler&#x27;s favorite cabinet video game is &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot;, which he has stated on several occasions on older episodes of &quot;Extended Play&quot; and &quot;X-Play&quot;. He stated: &quot;When I was 9 years old I used to scam quarters from my parents and sneak out to this local bowling alley that was so seedy Hubert Selby Jr. would get the creeps there. It smelled like personal abandonment. That&#x27;s what I think of when I play my favorite game&quot;.

Sessler has a younger brother, Jonathan, who appeared as Adam 2.0 in &quot;X-Play&quot;″s 2005 April Fool&#x27;s Day Episode, a &quot;clone&quot; of Adam who claims he&#x27;s much better-looking than the original Adam with a &quot;special USB port&quot; (a reference to the Game Boy Advance SP succeeding the original Game Boy Advance).

== Career ==

Sessler was the last remaining personality from the ZDTV network, surviving the network&#x27;s progression from ZDTV (1998–2000) to TechTV (2000–2004), and subsequent transition to G4. Sessler was one of seven TechTV personalities, with Morgan Webb, Sarah Lane, Kevin Rose, Chi-Lan Lieu, Blair Butler and Brendan Moran, to survive the massive layoffs resulting from the May 2004 merger of G4 and TechTV.

In addition to co-hosting &quot;X-Play&quot;, Sessler also appeared semi-regularly on &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; as a video game correspondent.

In early 2005, Sessler started prematurely balding which led to a video tribute for his hair during an X-Play video showcase. Sessler confused many by announcing he was leaving &quot;X-Play&quot; to host a late-night talk show on G4 entitled &quot;Meet the Sess&quot;. A trailer of the new show aired on &quot;X-Play&quot;, showing Sessler verbally and physically abusing his guests until they released information about upcoming video games. Despite being extremely over-the-top and obviously fake, many viewers began flooding the G4 forums asking when the show would air, and if Sessler was really leaving &quot;X-Play&quot;. On several occasions, Sessler has since publicly announced that the show was in fact an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke. However, he had a podcast called &quot;Sessler&#x27;s Soapbox&quot; as well as &quot;Feedback&quot;, where he discussed various gaming topics with other G4 correspondents and guests until late 2011, when he was replaced by Blair Herter.

On April 25, 2012, Sessler&#x27;s employment contract was terminated by G4TV. No reason was given for his termination. As of October 2012, he is listed as a judge on Syfy&#x27;s reality competition &quot;Viral Video Showdown.&quot;

On November 12, 2012, Sessler announced that he was joining Revision3. He remained with the network as Editor-in-Chief and Executive Producer of games content at Rev3Games until April 2014, when he announced his departure to &quot;explore new opportunities&quot; within &quot;gaming that help further the medium&quot;.

On April 2, 2014, Adam Sessler announced he was leaving Revision3 and would pursue a career outside video game journalism.

On June 9, 2014, Sessler appeared as a panelist on Spike TV&#x27;s coverage of E3 2014.

On June 19, 2015, he was featured as pre-show and post-show host of the Bethesda Game Studios E3 event alongside his past co-worker Morgan Webb.

In 2016, Sessler co-founded Spiketrap, an AI-based social media intelligence platform, with Kieran Fitzpatrick, who serves as its CEO. Spiketrap’s first customers have been video game publishers such as Ubisoft, Bethesda, and 2K. Sessler left the company in March 2020.

On February 12, 2021, G4 announced that Sessler would return to host &quot;Xplay&quot; on the relaunched television network, though the network ceased operations on October 16, 2022.

<text>Robert Emmanuel Pires (born 29 October 1973) is a French former professional footballer. He is widely regarded as one of Arsenal&#x27;s greatest ever players and one of the best wingers in the history of the sport.

Pires played for French clubs Metz and Marseille prior to his time with Arsenal, where he won three FA Cups and two Premier League titles, including the club&#x27;s unbeaten season of 2003–04. A former France international, Pires earned 79 caps between 1996 and 2004 for his country, including winning both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. He has been included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2001–02, 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, was the Player of the Tournament for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, FWA Player of the Year for the 2001–02 season, Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year for the 1995–96 season, and was included in the FIFA 100 by Pelé. He was also voted by Arsenal fans as the sixth greatest player in the club&#x27;s history.

Pires played the majority of his career as a left winger, but could also play all across the midfield or in a position to support the forward line. Pires used to be a coach at Arsenal.

==Early years==
Pires was born in Reims, France, to a Portuguese father and Spanish mother. Pires, the elder of two boys, spent most of his childhood dressed in two football shirts that reflected his divided loyalty. One was a Benfica shirt (his father was a fan) and the other was a Real Madrid shirt. Pires confessed he had difficulty in school because he did not speak French well at the time, due to the fact his parents only spoke Spanish and Portuguese. His passion for football was inherited from his father, António, who played with &quot;Les Corpo&quot;, a local team, and every Saturday night Pires would watch him play. At the age of 15, Pires left school and began his dream of a career in football with a two-year sports degree course in Reims. At the insistence of his mother, Pires continued with Reims and eventually was called up four years later.

==Club career==
===France===
Pires is a graduate of the FC Metz youth academy, making his senior debut in 1993 against Lyon. During his six seasons there, he scored 43 goals in 162 matches, and won the Coupe de la Ligue, prompting a £5 million move to Olympique de Marseille in 1998. Pires had a mixed two-year stay in Provence; his first season saw Marseille miss the 1998–99 French Division 1 title by a point (he had been even closer the year before when Metz had finished runners-up on goal difference) and they also reached the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, losing to Parma. His second season saw him suffer a spate of on- and off-field problems which led him to boycott the club at the season&#x27;s end.

===Arsenal===
====2000–01====
Pires was signed by Arsenal for £6 million in 2000, after stiff competition from Real Madrid and Juventus, replacing Marc Overmars, who had left for Barcelona for a record £25 million. He made his debut as a substitute against Sunderland on 19 August 2000. Initially, Pires&#x27; form was indifferent, and some people criticised him after his comments that the English game was too physical. However, he slowly began to regain the form he had shown at Metz, scoring a superb solo goal in October 2000, his first for Arsenal, against Lazio in the 2000–01 Champions League. Days later he scored his first league goal in a 2–1 win against West Ham United. During his time at Arsenal Pires had a habit of scoring against rivals Tottenham Hotspur, something he did on eight occasions. The first of such occasions came in a league game on 31 March 2001 when Arsenal won 2–0. A week later he scored against Tottenham again, this time the winner in the FA Cup semi-finals. However, Arsenal went on to lose the Cup final to Liverpool 2–1; Pires set up Arsenal&#x27;s goal for Freddie Ljungberg.

====2001–02====
By 2001–02, Pires had fully got to grips with the English game and had one of his best seasons. Pires scored superb goals against Middlesbrough and Aston Villa. Against Aston Villa, Pires chased after a long ball by Freddie Ljungberg, and lobbed the ball over the pursuing George Boateng, and finished off the move with a delightful lob over Peter Schmeichel. Pires also scored in a 1–1 draw against Tottenham at White Hart Lane, which would commence a sequence of five consecutive league seasons in which he would score in the North London Derby away at their rivals. He led the Premier League assist charts and was voted both FWA Footballer of the Year and Arsenal&#x27;s player of the season, as Arsenal won the league title. Pires provided the assist for Dennis Bergkamp when he scored his memorable pirouette goal against Newcastle United. However weeks later against the same opposition in the FA Cup Pires suffered a cruciate ligament injury (a game in which he had earlier scored). This also ruled him out of playing in the 2002 FA Cup Final and the 2002 World Cup with France.

====2002–03====
After a lengthy layoff, Pires made his comeback in November 2002 as a substitute against AJ Auxerre in the UEFA Champions League. Although Pires initially found it tough, he eventually returned to form, scoring 14 Premiership goals in 20 starts that season, including a hat-trick against Southampton on the penultimate day of the season. Other highlights included scoring twice against Fulham, including a last minute winner, and his customary goal at White Hart Lane. Pires was voted the Premier League Player of the Month for February 2003. Pires capped off his season by scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup Final against Southampton.

====2003–04====
He went on to be a crucial part of Arsenal&#x27;s quest for the Premier League title in the 2003–04 season, which they achieved, remaining unbeaten and becoming the first English top flight club to do so in 115 years. Pires and his Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry were instrumental in that season, scoring a combined 57 goals in all competitions. Pires made a sluggish start to the campaign, with just one goal to his name (against Everton) prior to October, but a wonder-goal against Liverpool at Anfield kick-started his season. Pires showed football fans his sublime technique, skills and finishing, most notably with his goals against Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers, and Leeds United. He surprised a lot of people with a world class tackle on Claude Makélélé and, following that, a run into the penalty box which dragged William Gallas and John Terry away, thus making space for Patrick Vieira to have a one-on-one with the Chelsea goalkeeper and subsequently scoring. Arsenal won that match 2–1, with Vieira&#x27;s goal the equaliser. That day of Premier League action proved decisive, as Manchester United&#x27;s failure to beat Leeds United during the same day resulted in Arsenal getting a huge lead in the title race. Arsenal never lost 1st place in the table for the rest of the season. In the UEFA Champions League quarter-final&#x27;s 1st leg match against Chelsea, Pires managed to beat John Terry to a header, which resulted in the equaliser for Arsenal, after Eiður Guðjohnsen had given Chelsea the lead. However, Arsenal were eliminated after they lost 1–2 in the return leg, courtesy of an 87th minute Wayne Bridge goal. Pires also scored home and away against Tottenham Hotspur. He showed his playmaking skills in a goal against Tottenham at White Hart Lane, in which Pires was the architect in building up the goal, and capped off the move with a goal to score Arsenal&#x27;s 2nd goal of the game. Tottenham refused to give up, and managed to claw their way back and claimed a 2–2 draw. Despite that, Arsenal won the title after the match. Pires finished that season with an impressive tally of 14 goals and seven assists in the Premier League. He was Arsenal&#x27;s second top scorer (behind Thierry Henry) and had the joint amount of assists (along with Dennis Bergkamp) that season.

====2004–05====
In the 2004–05 season, Pires finished third in the Premiership goalscorers&#x27; table with 14 goals, behind teammate Thierry Henry and Crystal Palace&#x27;s Andrew Johnson. Pires also picked up a second FA Cup winners&#x27; medal; he scored in the semi-final against Blackburn Rovers and then Arsenal beat Manchester United on penalties in the final. Pires was replaced by Edu in the 2nd half of extra time in that match.

====2005–06====
During the 2005–06 season, Pires started the season poorly, and players such as Freddie Ljungberg, José Antonio Reyes and Alexander Hleb were preferred to him on both wings. As the season progressed, though, Pires&#x27; form improved, outscoring his selection rivals overall despite a bizarre penalty incident with Thierry Henry against Manchester City when Pires, having scored from the spot earlier in the game, tried passing it to Arsenal&#x27;s star striker but Henry missed the ball and it went down as a penalty miss. Highlights in the league that season included scoring at White Hart Lane for the fifth consecutive season (his eighth and final goal against Tottenham) to help Arsenal salvage a 1–1 draw, and also scoring in the last game at Highbury against Wigan Athletic. Pires was instrumental in Arsenal&#x27;s Quarter Final Champions League first leg against Juventus, where Arsenal won 2–0. Pires successfully tackled Patrick Vieira and fed the ball to Thierry Henry who passed to Fàbregas to score Arsenal&#x27;s first goal, the first time that Pires had gotten the better of Vieira.

Pires played his last game for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions league final against Barcelona in Paris, which Arsenal ultimately lost 2–1. However, Pires was substituted after only 18 minutes when goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off and had to be replaced with Manuel Almunia. Pires later said Wenger&#x27;s decision to substitute him &quot;killed&quot; him: &quot;the fact that I was substituted and only allowed to play 18 minutes remains painful, there&#x27;s no point denying that... Wenger knows it and we still talk about it. I&#x27;ll never agree that he made the right decision.&quot;

====Departure====
During the 2005–06 season, Pires wrangled with Arsenal over a new contract, in the hope of a new two-year deal. In keeping with the club&#x27;s policy regarding players over 30, Pires was only offered a 12-month extension to his contract, which expired in June 2006.

In May 2006, Pires agreed to an offer from Villarreal after a month of speculation, during which time he and Arsenal defeated Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final.

One of the main reasons Pires gave for leaving Arsenal was that he felt he was no longer a first choice under manager Arsène Wenger. Pires was quoted saying: &quot;I have to say I have had some disappointments this season. For instance, I was on the bench very often&quot;. Pires additionally suggested that Wenger&#x27;s decision to withdraw him in the UEFA Champions League Final showed he had slipped in the eyes of his French boss. Pires said that he felt hurt by how Wenger did not trust him anymore, which was a major factor that convinced him that it was time to move on from Arsenal.

On the official Arsenal matchday program for the game against Wigan Athletic on 11 February 2007, Pires revealed his heartbreak of being substituted so early on during the Champions League final. Pires stated: &quot;I was very disappointed. When I saw my number on the fourth official&#x27;s board to be substituted, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was my last game after six years at the club, a Champions League Final in front of all my family in Paris where I became World Cup champion and it lasted just 12 minutes. That was very hard to take&quot;.

On 11 July 2008, Arsenal fans voted Pires as the club&#x27;s sixth greatest player of all time.

===Villarreal===
In May 2006, Pires agreed to join Spanish side Villarreal on a two-year contract. He joined on a free transfer, subject to passing a medical, bringing to an end his six-year career as an Arsenal player. After Villarreal were eliminated in the semi-finals of the 2006 Champions League by Arsenal, Villarrael coach Manuel Pellegrini had wanted to sign Arsenal&#x27;s Pires or Thierry Henry.

He scored his first goal for the club in 3–3 pre-season draw with Newcastle United on 5 August 2006. However, on 18 August 2006, Pires damaged the cruciate ligament in his left knee in a friendly match against Cádiz and required corrective surgery to alleviate the problem, which kept him out of action for seven months in his new club in Spanish top flight. Pires finally recovered from knee injury and made his first league appearance for Villarreal as a second-half substitute when he was named in Villarreal&#x27;s squad to face Real Sociedad on 17 March 2007. Pires scored his first league goal on his return from injury in a 3–3 draw away to Real Betis on 31 March 2007. After three appearances as a substitute, Pires made his first start for Villarreal on 22 April 2007 against Barcelona. He opened the scoring for his team to defeat league leaders Barcelona 2–0, avenging his premature departure against Barcelona in the Champions League Final the previous May.

On 13 May 2007, in a 4–1 win at Osasuna, Pires scored a seventh-minute opener as Villarreal continued their late-season push for a European spot. The run took Villarreal, at 11th spot without him in the side, to the brink of a UEFA Cup place in barely six weeks. Villarreal ended the season in 5th spot wherein Pires played crucial roles in helping Villarreal with the late charge up winning each of their final eight games and an entry into the UEFA Cup.

The 2007–08 season was marked by the ongoing saga between Juan Román Riquelme and the board of Villarreal. Despite this distraction, Pires&#x27; leadership qualities helped Villarreal to win six of their opening eight games. Against Barcelona at El Madrigal, Pires&#x27; technique earned the Yellow Submarine two penalties which were duly converted by captain Marcos Senna. Villarreal ended up finishing second in La Liga behind Real Madrid, which was their best league finish in history, beating Barcelona into third place.

In 2009, Pires faced former club Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League, coming on as a 70th-minute substitute in the first leg and playing the full 90 minutes at the Emirates Stadium. Villarreal were defeated 4–1 on aggregate, but Pires received a warm return from the Arsenal supporters, who sang his name throughout both legs.

Pires was told in May 2010 that his contract would not be extended and he would have to look for a new club during the summer as Villarreal will be &quot;changing their philosophy&quot;.

===Aston Villa===
Pires returned to England and trained at London Colney – Arsenal&#x27;s training ground, in order to keep his fitness levels up. In October 2010, it was reported that Conference National club Crawley Town intended to talk to Pires about joining them for some part of the season, but the player&#x27;s spokesman said they were &quot;not aware of any interest&quot; from that club.

On 16 November 2010, Aston Villa boss Gérard Houllier had been in talks with representatives of Pires. On 18 November, the 37-year-old midfielder completed his move to Aston Villa on a six-month contract. He made his Villa début in the Premier League on 21 November as a second-half substitute, although his new club were beaten 2–0 by Blackburn Rovers. Pires&#x27; arrival at the club was praised by many of Villa&#x27;s senior players, including Gabriel Agbonlahor, Stewart Downing Pires scored his first goal for Aston Villa in the 3–1 FA Cup win against Blackburn Rovers on 29 January 2011. His next start was also against Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League on 26 February. His performance in Villa&#x27;s 4–1 win was described by Sky Sports as &quot;his most influential&quot; since joining the club.

In early March, Pires announced that he would like to remain at Aston Villa for the 2011–12 season. Villa boss Gérard Houllier responded positively to this claim, but admitted that no decision would be made until the Summer of 2011. However, he was released by the club on 27 May 2011 after the 2010–11 season finished.

In September 2011, Pires made a guest appearance for Scottish Premier League side Hibernian in Ian Murray&#x27;s Testimonial match at Easter Road.

===FC Goa, India (retirement and coaching)===
In September 2013, Pires made a guest appearance for Premier League Aston Villa in Stiliyan Petrov&#x27;s Testimonial match at Celtic Park.

In July 2014, Pires announced a comeback to promote the launch of the Indian Super League. On 2 September 2014, he was signed by FC Goa, becoming their marquee signing. The 40-year-old came out of retirement to play for Goa, one of eight teams in the newly created league, and he captained the team.

&quot;For me the project and the passion for the game are very important. India needs a start. You need to progress. And for me, that was important. I had offers from the USA and Qatar but I wanted to be part of a new beginning for the sport in India. As for the conditions, we all know about them – but I&#x27;m ready and training hard. I like the pressure&quot;, he said. Pires is a regular at Arsenal&#x27;s training ground, using the facilities to stay fit, and said that he spoke to Arsène Wenger about playing in India: &quot;He told me if you have it in you and if you have the passion to go play in India, then do it. And I think I&#x27;m ready.&quot; &quot;The reception at the airport was amazing&quot;, he said, on his unveiling in India, before adding, &quot;Thank you for the welcome India... and the spicy food.&quot;

Pires made his league debut for Goa on 15 October 2014, a 2–1 defeat to Chennaiyin FC.

On 25 October 2014, he was given a two-match ban for insulting Atlético de Kolkata&#x27;s manager Antonio López Habas. He scored his first league goal on 13 November 2014 in a 4–1 away win over Delhi Dynamos.

Pires was released by Goa on 13 March 2015. On 25 February 2016, Pires announced his retirement from professional football.

Pires expressed interest in and was approached by Arsène Wenger with regard to coaching. As of 2016, Pires has commenced a career as a footballing coach with the first team at Arsenal.

==International career==
Pires was part of France&#x27;s 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winning squads, but had to miss the 2002 World Cup due to an injury he sustained playing for Arsenal. He also played in the 1996 Olympic Games and Euro 2004. However, a dispute in late 2004 with French national coach Raymond Domenech put a halt to Pires&#x27; international career. He won 79 caps for his country and scored 14 goals. He won the Golden Ball (for most outstanding football) and Golden Shoe (for most goals scored) awards at the 2001 Confederations Cup in Korea/Japan. Pires provided a golden goal assist during his international career, providing David Trézéguet with the match-winning ball in the Euro 2000 final.

==Personal life==
In 1992, during his initial year at FC Metz, Pires met his first wife, Nathalie. The two were married for six years and divorced in 2003. Pires told &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; that his divorce ruined him and affected him professionally, interfering with his concentration and sleep. He also blamed it for his odd behavior, such as publicly fighting with French coach Raymond Domenech in early 2004.

Shortly after the split from Nathalie, Pires met French model Jessica Lemarie through mutual friends. On 10 August 2005, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, Naia. Since then, Lemarie and Pires have married and had a son named Theo, born 11 July 2007.

On 17 January 2012, Pires became an ambassador for Grassroot Soccer, an international non-profit that uses the power of football to educate, inspire, and mobilize communities to stop the spread of HIV.

<doc id="553778" wikidata="Q1102708" url="?curid=553778" title="Clouseau (band)">
<text>Clouseau is a Flemish rock group, having success in Belgium and the Netherlands since being established in the late 1980s. Apart from a brush with English material in the early 1990s they perform in Dutch. Their biggest hits are &quot;Daar gaat ze&quot; (&quot;There she goes&quot;, a #1 hit in the Netherlands in 1990, and rerecorded in English as &quot;Close Encounters&quot;) and &quot;Passie&quot; (&quot;Passion&quot;, a #1 hit in the Netherlands in 1995).

==History==

===1987–1990===
Clouseau was set up by Bob Savenberg, who named the band after Inspector Clouseau, a character he enjoyed imitating and after whom he had named his radio station.

Initially, Clouseau only performed at local venues. Singer Koen Wauters soon left the group to sing for another local band, but in 1987 he was persuaded to return.

The same year they were discovered at the Marktrock festival in Leuven, Belgium. Their first single &quot;Brandweer&quot; (&quot;Firemen&quot;, also a pun that can be interpreted as &quot;Burning again&quot;) sold 427 copies. Their television debut followed in November of that year.

In 1989 Clouseau participated in the Belgian tryouts for the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Anne&quot;. Clouseau came in second, but &quot;Anne&quot; became an enormous hit in Belgium and a (minor) hit in the Netherlands. The popularity of Clouseau in Belgium skyrocketed, and that year Clouseau produced its first album, &quot;Hoezo?&quot; (&quot;Whaddayamean?&quot;).

In 1990 &quot;Daar gaat ze&quot; topped the singles charts in both Belgium and the Netherlands; several more hits followed. On 30 September Tjen Berghmans left the group after a dispute.

In October 1990 Clouseau released their second album, &quot;Of zo...&quot; (&quot;Or so...&quot;). In March 1991, Karel Theys departed, leaving Clouseau as a three-piece. A month later Clouseau came in 16th in the Eurovision Song Contest with &quot;Geef het op&quot;, but their participation resulted in a European breakthrough.

===1991–1999===
Afterwards it was announced that Koen Wauters was called up for the army; because of his Clouseau-commitments he only had to serve four weeks and didn&#x27;t need to shave his head. Fall 1991, Clouseau released their first English language album; &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (of which the title track is a translation of &quot;Daar gaat ze&quot;) was a huge success in Germany. The Dutch fans were less keen on the idea of Koen Wauters singing in another language and rather bought the live-album that was released during this period.

In 1992 Clouseau released a Dutch-language album, &quot;Doorgaan&quot; (&quot;Keep on going&quot;). At the same time, they supported Swedish group Roxette on their European tour performing the &quot;Close Encounters&quot;-material.

The second English-language album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;In every small town&quot; was recorded in Los Angeles. However, the album failed critically, receiving little attention outside the Benelux countries. Since then, Clouseau has refrained from producing English-language music (except for occasional singles, e.g. &quot;Weather With You&quot; (Crowded House cover) in 2000).

In 1995 they released the &quot;Oker&quot; album, which featured the single &quot;Passie&quot;. In 1996, founder Bob Savenberg left the group. At the time he hosted the television format of the Ultratop 50. Bob Savenberg now works with upcoming artists as a manager.

In September 1996 Clouseau released the &quot;Adrenaline&quot; album, which was promoted with a large tour.

On 22 December 1998 singer Koen Wauters married the Dutch television journalist and one-time MTV-presenter Carolyn Lilipaly (they divorced in 2002). 1999 saw the release of &quot;In Stereo&quot;. Clouseau were heading for a new direction. A live album was released in 2000, and Clouseau were touring Belgium and the Netherlands.

===2000–2009===
In 2001, Clouseau released the disco oriented CD &quot;En Dans&quot; (&quot;And Dance&quot;); the artwork was designed by Marcel Vanthilt and the title track became a huge hit. Whilst the fans were waiting for new material, the two remaining bandmembers presented the 2003 and 2004 editions of &quot;Idool&quot; (the Belgian version of &quot;Idols&quot;) on VTM. In October 2004 they released the &quot;Vanbinnen&quot; (&quot;Inside&quot;) album.

Since 2002 Clouseau are playing multiple Christmas shows at the Sportpaleis Antwerp. These concerts are a huge success with tickets selling out well in advance and each year&#x27;s series surpassing the previous. In 2005, 13 shows attracted over 200,000 visitors in total. Due to Koen&#x27;s Dakar-participation they couldn&#x27;t add any further dates.

In 2006 Clouseau performed in Antwerp at the 0110 concerts for tolerance, organised by Tom Barman, singer/guitarist with dEUS. At that moment seven shows were added for that year&#x27;s Christmas stint (Clouseau Speciale Editie).

The band released their latest CD &quot;Vonken &amp; Vuur&quot; (&quot;Sparks &amp; Flames&quot;) in March 2007 with &quot;De Tegenpartij&quot; (&quot;The Opposition Party&quot;) being the first single. The Dutch release followed a month later.

Their 20th anniversary was celebrated with the tribute album &quot;Braveau Clouseau&quot;.

On 5 December 2008 Clouseau played the first of their Crescendo Christmas-shows.

In 2009 they expressed their tiredness of Belgian communal tensions in a pro-Belgium song, a novelty in Flemish commercial popular culture. They toured across railway-stations and festivals which included their first show in the Netherlands in nine years.

=== 2010–present ===
In 2017 a documentary was aired in honour of their 30th anniversary. 

In 2023, they gave a surprise performance at Pukkelpop. They posed as a Finnish power pop duo named Tarkastaja. After the first song, the brothers took off their masks and announced themselves to the audience. During a ‘Back to the 80s, 90s &amp; Nillies’ event that year, they performed a record of 125 times in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, each time in front of an average of 15,000 spectators

To celebrate their 40th anniversary, the band announced ten Sportpaleis-concerts in December 2024 and January 2025.

<text>The Volvo V50 is the station wagon version of the Volvo S40 small family car first unveiled at the 2003 Bologna Motor Show, both assembled at Ghent, Belgium. Sharing the Volvo P1 platform with the European Ford Focus and the Mazda 3, the V50 featured interior &quot;theatre&quot; lighting, a floating center stack and &quot;Volvo Intelligent Vehicle Architecture&quot;.

== Overview ==

The V50 T5 AWD featured all-wheel drive and a straight-5 2.5 litre petrol engine, with a light pressure turbocharger, four valves per cylinder and a DOHC design with variable camshaft timing — providing and of torque. Diesel options were available in Europe, including a 2.4 Litre turbocharged D5 diesel engine which provided and of torque.

Within the United States, Volvo limited sales of the V50 PZEV cars to states where it was required, including California, Florida, Vermont, Connecticut, Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Oregon, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Mexico and Washington.

Volvo Cars Special Vehicle produced a concept car based on the V50, the V50 SV, whose engine produces , and debuted at the 2004 Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada.

== History ==

For the model year of 2008, the V50 received revised front styling, minor modifications to the interior, optional active xenon headlights, audio systems, increased power and torque of the T5 engine, availability of the D5, with a six speed manual and a 1.8 Flexifuel engine.

<doc id="553784" wikidata="Q1992196" url="?curid=553784" title="221B Baker Street">
<text>221B Baker Street is the London address of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the United Kingdom, postal addresses with a number followed by a letter may indicate a separate address within a larger, often residential building. Baker Street in the late 19th century was a high-class residential district, and Holmes&#x27;s apartment would probably have been part of a Georgian terrace.

The residence was introduced in the novel &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1887). At the time the Holmes stories were published, addresses in Baker Street did not go as high as 221. Baker Street was later extended, and in 1932 the Abbey National Building Society moved into premises at 219–229 Baker Street. For many years, Abbey National employed a full-time secretary to answer mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes. In 1990, a blue plaque signifying 221B Baker Street was installed at the Sherlock Holmes Museum, situated elsewhere on the same block, and there followed a 15-year dispute between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail addressed to 221B Baker Street. Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership of the address by the Holmes Museum has not been challenged, despite its location between 237 and 241 Baker Street. Its postal code is NW1 6XE.

==Doyle&#x27;s intentions==
When the Sherlock Holmes stories were first published, street numbers in Baker Street did not go as high as 221.

The section north of Marylebone Road near Regent&#x27;s Park – now including 221 Baker Street – was known in Doyle&#x27;s lifetime as Upper Baker Street. In his first manuscript, Doyle put Holmes&#x27;s house in Upper Baker Street. However, a British crime novelist named Nigel Morland claimed that, late in Doyle&#x27;s life, he identified the junction of Baker Street and George Street, about 500 metres south of the Marylebone Road, as the location of 221B. Sherlockian experts have also held to alternative theories as to where the original 221B was located and have maintained that it was further down Baker Street.

While at medical school in Edinburgh from 1876 to 1880, Doyle resided at 23 George Square near the university. The residence next door is 23-B.

==Real 221B Baker Street addresses==

===Abbey National===

When street numbers were reallocated in the 1930s, the block of odd numbers from 215 to 229 was assigned to an Art Deco building known as Abbey House, constructed in 1932 for the Abbey Road Building Society, which the society and its successor (which subsequently became Abbey National plc) occupied until 2002.

Almost immediately, the building society started receiving as many as 30 letters a month to Sherlock Holmes, including cards on 6 January, the date fans believe is his birthdate. It appointed a permanent &quot;secretary to Sherlock Holmes&quot; to answer them. A bronze plaque on the front of Abbey House carried a picture of Holmes and a quotation, but was removed from the building several years ago; its present whereabouts are unknown. In 1999, Abbey National sponsored a bronze statue of Sherlock Holmes at the entrance to Baker Street tube station.

===Sherlock Holmes Museum===

The Sherlock Holmes Museum is situated within an 1815 townhouse very similar to the 221B described in the stories and is located between 237 and 241 Baker Street. It displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum. The description of the house can be found throughout the stories, including the 17 steps leading from the ground-floor hallway to the first-floor study.

According to the published stories, &quot;221B Baker Street&quot; was a suite of rooms on the first floor of a lodging house above a flight of 17 steps. The main study overlooked Baker Street, and Holmes&#x27;s bedroom was adjacent to this room at the rear of the house, with Dr. Watson&#x27;s bedroom being on the floor above, overlooking a rear yard that had a plane tree in it.

===Address controversy===
The street number 221B was assigned to the Sherlock Holmes Museum on 27 March 1990 (replacing the logical address 239 Baker Street) when the Leader of Westminster City Council, Shirley Porter, unveiled a blue plaque signifying the address of 221B Baker Street. She was invited to renumber the museum&#x27;s building to coincide with its official opening (and because the number 221B had not been included in the original planning consent for the museum granted in October 1989).

A long-running dispute over the number arose between the Sherlock Holmes Museum, the building society Abbey National (which had previously answered the mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes) and subsequently the local Westminster City Council. The main objection to the museum&#x27;s role in answering the letters was that the number 221B bestowed on the museum by the council was out of sequence with the other numbers in the street: an issue that has since vexed local bureaucrats, who have striven for years to keep street numbers in sequence. In 2005, Abbey National vacated their headquarters in Baker Street, which left the museum to battle with Westminster City Council to end the dispute over the number, which had created negative publicity. Eventually the museum was granted special permission by the City of Westminster to bear the address of 221B Baker Street.

In 2018, &quot;Quartz&quot; revealed that, according to court documents and the Panama Papers, the property was owned at least partially by relatives of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then Kazakhstani president.

In 2020, &quot;The Times&quot; confirmed that in addition to various other properties between 215 and 237 Baker Street totalling around £140 million, the current property is jointly owned by the daughter of the former Kazakhstani president, Dariga Nazarbayeva and her son Nurali Aliyev. Ownership was transferred from Nazarbayeva&#x27;s ex-husband Rakhat Aliyev after his death in 2015.

==In other media==

The fictional address has been portrayed in the following pastiches of Sherlock Holmes:

*In the animated film &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), based on the Basil of Baker Street book series, Basil resides in 221½ Baker Street, a mouse-hole beneath 221B Baker Street.
*Private detective Louie Knight moves into an office at 22/1B &quot;Stryd-y-Popty&quot; (which translates as Baker Street in Welsh) in Malcolm Pryce&#x27;s Welsh Noir parody &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being in Aberystwyth.&quot;
*The 1987 CBS movie &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (not to be confused with the 1986 British television series of the same name) features Holmes, cryogenically frozen in 1899 and awakened in modern times, trying to adapt with the aid of Watson&#x27;s granddaughter, Jane. He seeks out his old residence and finds the spot occupied by a McDonald&#x27;s franchise.
*Dr. Gregory House, the protagonist of &quot;House, M.D.&quot;, lives at 221 Baker Street, Apartment B, Princeton, New Jersey.

<text>The All-Star Squadron is a DC Comics superhero team that debuted in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #193 (August 1981) and was created by Roy Thomas, Rich Buckler and Jerry Ordway. Although the team was introduced in the 1980s, its self-titled series took place in the 1940s, retroactively inserting their narratives into the fictional history of the DC Comics superheroes. The team included many of DC&#x27;s Golden Age era characters, new characters, and other World War II superheroes which DC did not own during the 1940s but later acquired. The name &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; was creator Roy Thomas&#x27; reference to &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, the series that introduced the Justice Society of America, the first comic book superhero team.

According to the series &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, US President Franklin Roosevelt creates a &quot;superhero draft&quot; called Article X during World War II. Article X asks all active American masked crime-fighters and superhuman adventurers to join forces as a single war-time organization, just as many American labor organizations did during World War II. In the canon of DC Comics, the Axis Powers used the mystical Spear of Destiny to create a &quot;sphere of influence&quot; over their occupied territories and surrounding areas during most of World War II. This sphere of influence caused superhumans, magically empowered people, and magic-users to fall under Hitler&#x27;s control and take on some of his personality traits. For this reason, the All-Star Squadron focused its activities on protecting the US from invasion, super-villains, spies, and sabotage rather than risk their minds being controlled by the Axis Powers if they operated overseas in Europe or Asia.

After their introduction in Justice League of America, the team starred in the series &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; which ran from 1981 to 1987. At different times, the organization&#x27;s chairperson was Liberty Belle or Hawkman. A spin-off series entitled &quot;Young All-Stars&quot; began in 1987 and published 32 issues.

==Publication history==
During the Golden Age of Comics (roughly 1935–1951), several comic books featured crime-fighters, &quot;mystery-men&quot;, adventurers, and superheroes. DC Comics began publishing the anthology series &quot;All Star Comics&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;) in 1940. In issue #3, DC had many of their superheroes join together for dinner and share stories, declaring the gathering to be the first meeting of the Justice Society of America. The JSA was the first comic book superhero team and became the main feature of &quot;All Star Comics&quot; until it was canceled with issue #57 in 1951.

Writer Gerry Conway revived the &quot;All Star Comics&quot; series in 1976, continuing the original numbering by starting with issue #58. By this time, DC had established that its modern day adventures took place in the universe of Earth-One, whereas DC&#x27;s Golden Age stories during the 1930s and 40s occurred in a parallel reality called Earth-Two. While the Golden Age Superman, introduced in 1938, had lived through World War II, the Earth-One Superman had not even been born until long after the war was over. While the modern-day Earth-One Wonder Woman was a superhero in her prime, new stories revealed that the Golden Age Wonder Woman of Earth-Two had fought Nazis during World War II, then later semi-retired, married her dear friend Steve Trevor, and had a daughter named Hyppolyta Trevor (who became a hero called Fury and joined a team of heroes known as Infinity, Inc.).

The 1970s revival of &quot;All Star Comics&quot; involved some flashback stories, but most of the issues took place in the modern day, showing the Justice Society members as older heroes decades after World War II. Conway also included younger heroes in the group, such as Power Girl (an Earth-Two version of Supergirl). His hope was to later have the younger members star in a spin-off series of their own, forming a team that could be called the All-Star Squadron. Management at DC worried that the team&#x27;s name would be abbreviated as A.S.S., and so the group&#x27;s name was changed to the Super Squad.

A team known as the All-Star Squadron debuted years later in a special insert in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #193 (August 1981). The team&#x27;s official series &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; then began the following month with the creative team of writer Roy Thomas, with artists Rich Buckler and Jerry Ordway. The comic book series lasted 67 issues from September 1981 to March 1987, with three annuals published as well.

In &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #1, series writer Roy Thomas published &quot;An Open Letter to the Readers&quot; wherein he described the impetus for the series. Namely, DC wanted a comic book telling tales of the Justice Society of America (JSA). The last series to do so was the second volume of &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, which lasted only seventeen issues from 1976 to 1979. As Roy Thomas put it, DC management gave him &quot;a chance to write a return of the JSA&quot;. Instead of writing stories in the modern era of Earth-Two, Roy Thomas chose to set the series during World War II. Roy Thomas decided to include other Golden Age era characters that weren&#x27;t published by DC Comics during the 1930s and 40s but were acquired by the company in later years, such as the Quality Comics characters. All-Star Squadron established that most of these characters co-existed with the Golden Age DC heroes on Earth-Two.

In a nod to the original JSA adventures in &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, writer Roy Thomas tried to include at least a cameo appearance by the Golden Age Hawkman in every issue, since he was the one hero to appear in every Golden Age issue of the original &quot;All Star Comics series&quot;, including the two issues that predated the formation of the Justice Society of America. Although Hawkman did not appear in every issue of the second &quot;All Star Comic&quot; series, Roy Thomas wanted to create a new streak for the character in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;. The artwork for issue #49 was printed without Hawkman&#x27;s cameo included, making it the only issue of the series where he does not appear.

The All-Star Squadron team is an example of &quot;retroactive continuity&quot; or &quot;retcon&quot;, since the team itself was retroactively inserted into the history of DC superheroes and the series rewrote portions of already-established DC canon published during the 1940s. The first known use of the term &quot;retcon&quot; was by Roy Thomas in the letter column of &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #20 (April 1983). Several story lines ironed out continuity errors, fleshed out characters&#x27; origins, explained inconsistencies in character development, and resolved lingering questions and plot threads. Roy Thomas had used the Marvel Comics series &quot;Invaders&quot; in a similar way to address and revise official Marvel fictional history. Several issues of the series offered detailed origin stories of various characters, sometimes with revised details. Characters who had origin issues dedicated to them included Amazing-Man, Starman, Doctor Fate, Liberty Belle, Robotman, Johnny Quick, and the Tarantula. The story arc in issues #32-33 detailed how the Freedom Fighters traveled from Earth-Two to Earth-X, an event indicated in an earlier Justice League story.

With so many characters to choose from, the creative team decided to concentrate on &quot;quite promising characters who have been ignored or underplayed for years&quot;, instead of only those Earth-Two characters who had popular counterparts on Earth-One. For examples, &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; did not focus much on the Earth-Two versions of Superman and Wonder Woman, nor on the Golden Age version of the Flash, Jay Garrick, whose counterpart Barry Allen was very popular as the Flash of Earth-One. Roy Thomas wrote: &quot;If we lost the original GL, we gained the Earth-Two Robotman; if we dropped Jay (Flash) Garrick, we picked up on Johnny Quick; Liberty Belle could stand in for Wonder Woman till more super-powered ladies came along. We even tossed in an Earth-Two version of the venerable Plastic Man, whose series in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; was just folding...&quot;

When Rich Buckler left the series after the fifth issue, editor Len Wein hired artist Adrian Gonzales as a replacement and notified Roy Thomas with a note stating &quot;You&#x27;re going to like Adrian Gonzales&quot;. He drew the series for 13 issues, during which the team had a crossover with the &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. Jerry Ordway, who had inked the series since its start, became the series regular penciler starting with issue #19 (March 1983). He and Thomas then co-created the Infinity, Inc. team, introducing it in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #25 (Sept. 1983).

&quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #31 (1984) featured the group&#x27;s first &quot;full roster&quot; general meeting, taking place at their headquarters. The All-Star Squadron HQ was depicted as the Trylon and Perisphere, actual structures in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York, constructed for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The Perisphere contained the Squadron meeting hall, while the Trylon was retrofitted as an aircraft hangar/vertical launch platform. The All-Star Squadron had a robotic butler named Gernsback, based on the Elektro robots from the fair and named after science fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback.

During the 1985-86 series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Earth-Two and Earth-One, along with some other realities, merged into a new, unified reality with a revised history. The heroes of World War II now existed in the same timeline as modern heroes, simply operating at an earlier time. While it was not a major problem to establish that certain characters such as the Golden Age Flash (a man named Jay Garrick) and the later Flash (a man named Barry Allen) could co-exist and both operate during different time periods, this explanation didn&#x27;t work for heroes with direct counterparts. Golden Age heroes such as Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, and Green Arrow all of whom had the same secret identities, same basic origin stories, and largely similar supporting casts as their modern day counterparts. For this reason, these particular Golden Age heroes, and some others, had to be removed from the history of the new, unified timeline. This also meant the canon of several recent &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; stories was now questionable, since the Golden Age versions of those same heroes made multiple appearances in the series.

To clear the slate after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and re-launch the franchise, &quot;All Star Squadron&quot; ended with issue #67 and the series was succeeded by &quot;Young All-Stars&quot;. Since then, the All-Star Squadron has appeared in sporadic stories published by DC Comics. Article X was used again during the crossover &quot;Final Crisis&quot; when Earth&#x27;s superheroes needed to unite against the forces of Darkseid and the evil New Gods.

== Fictional history ==

On the day of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt gathered available superheroes—including members of the Justice Society of America, Freedom Fighters, and solo heroes—at the White House. He asked them to band together for the war as the All-Star Squadron to battle sabotage and keep the peace on the home front during World War II. The rationale for not using the Squadron in combat situations in the European or Pacific Theaters of War was that Adolf Hitler had possession of the Spear of Destiny, a mystical object that gave him control of any superheroes with magic-based powers or a vulnerability to magic (including Superman, Green Lantern, Doctor Fate and others) who crossed into territory held by the Axis Powers.

At the time, many of the Justice Society members had been captured by the time-travelling villain Per Degaton with the help of JSA foes he had pulled back in time, but the available heroes were asked to first guard against a potential attack on the West Coast of the United States. Degaton himself used some stolen Japanese planes with hypnotized troopers to launch such an attack on San Francisco, hoping to change history by making the United States fight to a stalemate against Japan, enabling him to take over the world, so the new Squadron&#x27;s first major mission was to stop the attack and rescue the captured heroes, who also became part of the new group. Due to Per Degaton going back in time after the JSA were freed they forgot his involvement, though the events were not wiped. America&#x27;s entry into the war caused several of the members of the JSA to enlist, or be drafted in their civilian identities. These included Alan Scott, Starman, Hawkman, The Atom and Johnny Thunder.

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, the Prime-Earth version of the All-Star Squadron is revealed to exist as the bio for the Golden Age Aquaman mentions that he was briefly a member of this group. Mister Terrific also mentioned that the All-Star Squadron was once helped out by the Golden Age Legionnaire (later revealed to be a younger version of Mordru who wants to avoid the path of evil).

<text>A chemical database is a database specifically designed to store chemical information. This information is about chemical and crystal structures, spectra, reactions and syntheses, and thermophysical data.

==Types of chemical databases ==

=== Bioactivity database ===

Bioactivity databases correlate structures or other chemical information to bioactivity results taken from bioassays in literature, patents, and screening programs.


=== Chemical structures ===
Chemical structures are traditionally represented using lines indicating chemical bonds between atoms and drawn on paper (2D structural formulae). While these are ideal visual representations for the chemist, they are unsuitable for computational use and especially for search and storage. Small molecules (also called ligands in drug design applications), are usually represented using lists of atoms and their connections. Large molecules such as proteins are however more compactly represented using the sequences of their amino acid building blocks. Radioactive isotopes are also represented, which is an important attribute for some applications. Large chemical databases for structures are expected to handle the storage and searching of information on millions of molecules taking terabytes of physical memory.

=== Literature database ===

Chemical literature databases correlate structures or other chemical information to relevant references such as academic papers or patents. This type of database includes STN, Scifinder, and Reaxys. Links to literature are also included in many databases that focus on chemical characterization.

=== Crystallographic database ===

Crystallographic databases store X-ray crystal structure data. Common examples include Protein Data Bank and Cambridge Structural Database.

=== NMR spectra database ===

NMR spectra databases correlate chemical structure with NMR data. These databases often include other characterization data such as FTIR and mass spectrometry.

=== Reactions database ===

Most chemical databases store information on stable molecules but in databases for reactions also intermediates and temporarily created unstable molecules are stored. Reaction databases contain information about products, educts, and reaction mechanisms.

A popular example that lists chemical reaction data, among others, would be the Beilstein database, Reaxys

=== Thermophysical database ===

Thermophysical data are information about
* phase equilibria including vapor–liquid equilibrium, solubility of gases in liquids, liquids in solids (SLE), heats of mixing, vaporization, and fusion.
* caloric data like heat capacity, heat of formation and combustion,
* transport properties like viscosity and thermal conductivity

== Chemical structure representation ==

There are two principal techniques for representing chemical structures in digital databases

* As connection tables / adjacency matrices / lists with additional information on bond (edges) and atom attributes (nodes), such as:
*:MDL Molfile, PDB, CML
* As a linear string notation based on depth first or breadth first traversal, such as:
*:SMILES/SMARTS, SLN, WLN, InChI

These approaches have been refined to allow representation of stereochemical differences and charges as well as special kinds of bonding such as those seen in organo-metallic compounds. The principal advantage of a computer representation is the possibility for increased storage and fast, flexible search.

== Search ==

=== Substructure ===
Chemists can search databases using parts of structures, parts of their IUPAC names as well as based on constraints on properties. Chemical databases are different from other general purpose databases in their support for substructure search, a method to retrieve chemicals matching a pattern of atoms and bonds which a user specifies. This kind of search is achieved by looking for subgraph isomorphism (sometimes also called a monomorphism) and is a widely studied application of graph theory.

Query structures may contain bonding patterns such as &quot;single/aromatic&quot; or &quot;any&quot; to provide flexibility. Similarly, the vertices which in an actual compound would be a specific atom may be replaced with an atom list in the query. &quot;Cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism at double bonds is catered for by giving a choice of retrieving only the E form, the Z form, or both.

===Conformation===
Search by matching 3D conformation of molecules or by specifying spatial constraints is another feature that is particularly of use in drug design. Searches of this kind can be computationally very expensive. Many approximate methods have been proposed, for instance BCUTS, special function representations, moments of inertia, ray-tracing histograms, maximum distance histograms, shape multipoles to name a few.

===Examples===
Large databases, such as PubChem and ChemSpider, have graphical interfaces for search. The Chemical Abstracts Service provides tools to search the chemical literature and Reaxys supplied by Elsevier covers both chemicals and reaction information, including that originally held in the Beilstein database. PATENTSCOPE makes chemical patents accessible by substructure and Wikipedia&#x27;s articles describing individual chemicals can also be searched that way.

Suppliers of chemicals as synthesis intermediates or for high-throughput screening routinely provide search interfaces. Currently, the largest database that can be freely searched by the public is the ZINC database, which is claimed to contain over 37 billion commercially available molecules.

==Descriptors==
All properties of molecules beyond their structure can be split up into either physico-chemical or pharmacological attributes also called descriptors. On top of that, there exist various artificial and more or less standardized naming systems for molecules that supply more or less ambiguous names and synonyms. The IUPAC name is usually a good choice for representing a molecule&#x27;s structure in a both human-readable and unique string although it becomes unwieldy for larger molecules. Trivial names on the other hand abound with homonyms and synonyms and are therefore a bad choice as a defining database key. While physico-chemical descriptors like molecular weight, (partial) charge, solubility, etc. can mostly be computed directly based on the molecule&#x27;s structure, pharmacological descriptors can be derived only indirectly using involved multivariate statistics or experimental (screening, bioassay) results. All of those descriptors can for reasons of computational effort be stored along with the molecule&#x27;s representation and usually are.

== Similarity ==
There is no single definition of molecular similarity, however the concept may be defined according to the application and is often described as an inverse of a measure of distance in descriptor space. Two molecules might be considered more similar for instance if their difference in molecular weights is lower than when compared with others. A variety of other measures could be combined to produce a multi-variate distance measure. Distance measures are often classified into Euclidean measures and non-Euclidean measures depending on whether the triangle inequality holds. Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) based substructure search (similarity or distance measure) is also very common. MCS is also used for screening drug like compounds by hitting molecules, which share common subgraph (substructure).

Chemicals in the databases may be clustered into groups of &#x27;similar&#x27; molecules based on similarities. Both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering approaches can be applied to chemical entities with multiple attributes. These attributes or molecular properties may either be determined empirically or computationally derived descriptors. One of the most popular clustering approaches is the Jarvis-Patrick algorithm.

In pharmacologically oriented chemical repositories, similarity is usually defined in terms of the biological effects of compounds (ADME/tox) that can in turn be semiautomatically inferred from similar combinations of physico-chemical descriptors using QSAR methods.

== Registration systems ==
Databases systems for maintaining unique records on chemical compounds are termed as Registration systems. These are often used for chemical indexing, patent systems and industrial databases.

Registration systems usually enforce uniqueness of the chemical represented in the database through the use of unique representations. By applying rules of precedence for the generation of stringified notations, one can obtain unique/&#x27;canonical&#x27; string representations such as &#x27;canonical SMILES&#x27;. Some registration systems such as the CAS system make use of algorithms to generate unique hash codes to achieve the same objective.

A key difference between a registration system and a simple chemical database is the ability to accurately represent that which is known, unknown, and partially known. For example, a chemical database might store a molecule with stereochemistry unspecified, whereas a chemical registry system requires the registrar to specify whether the stereo configuration is unknown, a specific (known) mixture, or racemic. Each of these would be considered a different record in a chemical registry system.

Registration systems also preprocess molecules to avoid considering trivial differences such as differences in halogen ions in chemicals.

An example is the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registration system. See also CAS registry number.

== Tools ==

The computational representations are usually made transparent to chemists by graphical display of the data. Data entry is also simplified through the use of chemical structure editors. These editors internally convert the graphical data into computational representations.

There are also numerous algorithms for the interconversion of various formats of representation. An open-source utility for conversion is OpenBabel. These search and conversion algorithms are implemented either within the database system itself or as is now the trend is implemented as external components that fit into standard relational database systems. Both Oracle and PostgreSQL based systems make use of cartridge technology that allows user defined datatypes. These allow the user to make SQL queries with chemical search conditions (For example, a query to search for records having a phenyl ring in their structure represented as a SMILES string in a SMILESCOL column could be
 SELECT * FROM CHEMTABLE WHERE SMILESCOL.CONTAINS(&#x27;c1ccccc1&#x27;)
Algorithms for the conversion of IUPAC names to structure representations and vice versa are also used for extracting structural information from text. However, there are difficulties due to the existence of multiple dialects of IUPAC. Work is on to establish a unique IUPAC standard (See InChI).

<doc id="553796" wikidata="Q3061319" url="?curid=553796" title="Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry">
<text>Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI, generally referred to as the Patricias) is one of the three Regular Force infantry regiments of the Canadian Army of the Canadian Armed Forces. Formed in 1914, it is named for Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of the then-Governor General of Canada. The regiment is composed of three battalions, for a total of 2,000 soldiers. The PPCLI is the main lodger unit of Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Edmonton in Alberta and CFB Shilo in Manitoba, and attached to 3rd Canadian Division; as such, it serves as the &quot;local&quot; regular infantry regiment for much of Western Canada. The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (LER), a Reserve Force battalion, is affiliated with the PPCLI but is not formally part of it. As part of this affiliation, the LER carries the designation &#x27;4th Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry&#x27;.

The PPCLI is a &quot;British-style&quot; Regiment which serves as the spiritual home and repository of customs and traditions for a number of battalions that do not necessarily serve together operationally. Its three battalions are independent operational entities, within 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG). The regimental title is honorific: two of the battalions are mechanized infantry and the unit has never been organized as a traditional &quot;light infantry&quot; regiment.

The PPCLI was raised on the initiative of Captain Andrew Hamilton Gault in 1914 as part of the British Empire&#x27;s war effort for the First World War. It was the first Canadian infantry unit to enter the theatre of operations, arriving in France on December 21, 1914. The regiment served with both the British and Canadian Expeditionary Forces, and was retained as a regular infantry regiment after the war. The regiment mobilized again in the Second World War, provided three battalions in succession for the Korean War, and most recently fought in the War in Afghanistan. The regiment has also provided units for numerous NATO operations and United Nations peacekeeping missions. The regiment has received 39 battle honours, three Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendations and the United States Presidential Unit Citation.

== Structure ==
The regiment is composed of three battalions, all of which are Regular Force units and part of the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1CMBG). Each battalion is a distinct operational entity in the Canadian Forces&#x27; order of battle. The two first battalions are mechanized infantry, while the third one is light infantry. The regimental headquarters are on CFB Edmonton.

=== 1st Battalion ===
The 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (1PPCLI) is at Steele Barracks, CFB Edmonton, Alberta. 1 PPCLI is a mechanized infantry battalion of the Regular Force and uses the LAV 6.0 (light armoured vehicle) as its primary fighting vehicle. The battalion is made of three rifle companies, combat support company comprising reconnaissance and signals platoons as well as a sniper group, and administration company. The current commander is Lieutenant-Colonel C. Petersen, CD Its regimental sergeant-major (RSM) is Chief Warrant Officer B. Worth,CD.

=== 2nd Battalion ===
The 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (2PPCLI) is based at Kapyong Barracks in CFB Shilo, Manitoba. The battalion is a mechanized infantry unit of the Regular Force and is part of the 1CMBG. The battalion is composed of three rifle companies (A, B and C), one combat support company, and one command and administration company. Each rifle company is made of three platoons and a headquarters element, and has 15 LAV 6.0 infantry fighting vehicles. The combat support company is composed of a reconnaissance platoon and a signals platoon. The current battalion commander is Lieutenant-Colonel J Van Eijk, CD. Its Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) is Chief Warrant Officer Dunwoody, CD

=== 3rd Battalion ===
The 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (3PPCLI) is based at Steele Barracks, CFB Edmonton, Alberta. The battalion is a light infantry unit of the Regular Force, and the only one in Western Canada. The battalion is composed of three rifle companies, one combat support company and one combat service support company. 3PPCLI also maintains an airborne and mountain operations capability. The commanding officer (CO) is Lieutenant-Colonel J.C. Thamer, CD The regimental sergeant major is Chief Warrant Officer L.J. Schnurr, CD.

==Lineage==
Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry originated in Ottawa, Ontario, on 10 August 1914. The Permanent Active Militia (Regular Force) component was formed on 1 April 1919 and the Canadian Expeditionary Force component of the regiment was disbanded on 30 August 1920.

Following the Second World War on 1 March 1946, the Canadian Active Service Force regiment was disbanded and the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, CIC was redesignated Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, CIC. On 27 June 1946, the regiment was embodied in the post-war Permanent Force (Active Force).

On 7 August 1950, the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, RCIC was authorized to be formed as an Active Force unit embodied in the Special Force. On 1 January 1952, it ceased to be embodied in the Canadian Army Special Force.

On 30 November 1950, the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, RCIC was authorized to be formed as an Active Force unit embodied in the Special Force. On 1 November 1953, it ceased to be embodied in the Canadian Army Special Force. On 8 January 1954, it was reduced to nil strength and the battalion was disbanded on 21 July 1954. On 27 April 1970, the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry was authorized to be formed as a Regular Force unit.

On 3 November 1997, the regiment was granted the perpetuation of the 260th Battalion Canadian Rifles, Canadian Expeditionary Force (Siberia).

== History ==

=== Early history and First World War (1914–1919) ===
At the outbreak of World War I, when Canada was lacking regular military forces, the then-Captain Andrew Hamilton Gault raised the Patricias. Hamilton Gault offered $100,000 () to finance and equip a battalion to participate in the Canadian war effort overseas. The government temporarily accepted his offer on August 6, 1914, and officially authorized it on August 10. The Department of Militia and Defence contributed to the equipment of the unit. The charter of the regiment was signed on August 10, and the Governor General of Canada, The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, approved the creation of the regiment.

A sandstone slab memorial at Lansdowne Park is dedicated to the founding of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry at this location in August 1914.

Lieutenant-Colonel Francis D. Farquhar was instrumental in assisting Hamilton Gault in founding the regiment. Colonel Farquhar, Military Secretary to Canada&#x27;s Governor General, asked the Duke of Connaught for permission to name the regiment after his daughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught. She was pleased to accept this honour and thus Princess Patricia&#x27;s were established. &quot;Light Infantry&quot; in the battalion name was chosen by Captain Gault, who served during the Second Boer War and liked the impression of an irregular force that the name inspired.

Farquhar and Gault moved expeditiously to mobilize the regiment. The day after authority was granted, August 11, the two men began an aggressive recruitment campaign. Due to the patriotic outpouring following the August 4 declaration of war, 3,000 applicants were recruited within eight days. By August 19 a full complement of 1,098 had been selected, of those, 1,049 had previously served in South Africa or in the British Army. Farquhar became the first commander of the battalion. The regiment&#x27;s first formal parade was conducted on August 23 in Ottawa, during which Princess Patricia presented the regimental standard. Princess Patricia, Colonel-in-Chief, designed and made by hand the regimental flag to be presented on that occasion. It is a crimson flag with a circular royal blue centre. In the circle are gold initials &quot;V P&quot;, which stands for Victoria Patricia. The regimental standard became known as the &quot;Ric-A-Dam-Doo&quot;. This flag was carried in every regimental action during World War I. It was not officially adopted as a regimental colour and consecrated as such until after the First World War.As a Canadian regiment mobilized in a time of wartime shortages, the regiment was equipped with weapons from a variety of sources. Private soldiers initially carried the Canadian .303 Ross rifle, while officers and non-commissioned officers normally carried the 1914 Colt Canadian-contract .45 M1911 pistol.

The regiment left Ottawa on August 28 and boarded the SS &quot;Megantic&quot; in Montreal, Quebec. However, because of enemy action in the Atlantic Ocean, the regiment had to deboard at Lévis, Quebec. During the period of training at Lévis, following extensive tests on the Ross rifle, the Patricias issued the first of what would be many damning reports of the suitability of the Ross rifle for combat. The regiment finally left on September 27 from Quebec City on board the &quot;Royal George&quot; for England in company with the rest of the first Canadian contingent.

Upon arrival at their camp on the Salisbury Plain, England on October 18 the regiment was first stationed at Bustard Camp near Stonehenge. On November 16 the unit joined the 80th Brigade of the British Expeditionary Force at Winchester. At that time the regiment abandoned the troubled Ross rifle in favour of the British Lee–Enfield. On 20 December, the regiment departed for the port of Southampton with the rest of the brigade and embarked for France arriving the next day. On this date the PPCLI was the only Canadian infantry unit on the battlefield; only the 1st Canadian Medical Corps was there before.

The Patricias first took their place in the trenches on January 6, 1915, at a location known to the British Army&#x27;s soldiers as &quot;Dickiebush&quot;.

When Farquhar was killed in action at St Eloi on March 20, he was replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel H. Buller, another British regular, who had served with him on the staff of the governor general before the war.

On May 8, the stout defence of Bellewaerde Ridge during the Battle of Frezenberg established the reputation of the Patricias but at tremendous cost. When they came out of the line the 700 men that had started the battle had been reduced to just 150 who were battle ready. The tattered remains were commanded by a lieutenant, all other officers having been killed or wounded. The phrase &quot;holding up the whole damn line&quot; became one of unit&#x27;s unofficial mottos for the regiment.

The PPCLI served for a year with the 80th Brigade before joining the new 7th Brigade within the 3rd Canadian Division on December 22. In 1916 the regiment fought major battles at Mount Sorrel and on the Somme. It was not until October 1916 that the first Canadian, Lieutenant-Colonel Agar Adamson, was appointed to command the regiment. In 1917 as part of the Canadian Corps, the regiment took part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge on April 9, and Passchendaele later the same year. In 1918 the regiment fought at the Battle of Amiens, Jigsaw Wood, and the Battle of the Canal du Nord as part of the great battles of the Hundred Days that ended the war. The 4th Company PPCLI entered Mons with other Canadian troops early on November 11, before the armistice took effect at 11 am.

During the Battle of Passchendaele Sergeant George Harry Mullin earned the Victoria Cross, the highest honor in the British Empire. Sergeant Robert Spall won the regiment&#x27;s second Victoria Cross at Parvilliers on August 12 and 13, 1918.

A former Patricia, Lieutenant Hugh McKenzie, who had risen from private to company sergeant-major before accepting his commission and transferring to the Canadian Machine Gun Corps, was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for his actions during Passchendaele. He had already won the Empire&#x27;s second-highest award for gallantry, the Distinguished Conduct Medal, while serving with the regiment as well as the French Croix de Guerre. On 30 October 1917, he was a member of the 7th Canadian Machine Gun Company, Canadian Machine Gun Corps, leading a section of four machine guns in support of the regiment. Seeing that one of the PPCLI companies was hesitating to advance in the face of a German machine gun position on dominating ground, he handed command of his troops to an NCO and went to rally the men of his old regiment. McKenzie organized an attack and captured the enemy position. Once on the position, however, he realized that it was itself under dominating enemy machine gun fire from a nearby pillbox. McKenzie organized parties to capture the pillbox by making both frontal and flanking attacks. He was killed while leading the frontal attack. When the awarded of his Victoria Cross was announced in the London Gazette on 12 February 1918, his surname was misspelled as &quot;Mackenzie.&quot;

On February 4, 1915, Private Guy Dwyer became the Patricias&#x27; first combat death of the war.
The last of the Patricias killed in action was likely Corporal Percy Wainwright Carleton on 10 November 1918. In total 1,272 officers and enlisted men of the Patricias were killed and 82 officers and enlisted men were captured during the war.The 260th Battalion, Canadian Rifles, CEF (Siberia) was authorized on 1 November 1918 in Victoria, B.C. and embarked for Russia on 29 December 1918. It served with the 16th Infantry Brigade as part of the Allied Forces in eastern Russia until 9 May 1919. The battalion was disbanded on 15 November 1920. The service of the 260th Battalion, CEF (Siberia) resulted in Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry being awarded the battle honour .

=== Between the wars (1918–1939) ===
On March 20, 1919, the regiment became a component of the Permanent Active Militia. In 1920 the regimental headquarters, A Company and D Company were relocated to Fort Osborne Barracks, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, while B Company relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia. The period between the two wars was a recession period for the Canadian Armed Forces, and the regiment lost 209 soldiers in 1924.

In 1926 a group of officers and friends of the PPCLI erected a plaque in the chapel of a women&#x27;s monastery on Echo Drive, across the Rideau Canal from Lansdowne Park which was dedicated to the memory of the war dead and veterans of the PPCLI during the First World War. It was moved to St. Clement Chapel, Albion Road in 1985, then to St. Clement&#x27;s new premises at 87 Mann Avenue in 1993.

=== Second World War (1939–1945) ===

World War II began in Europe on September 1, 1939, and the Parliament of Canada declared war between Canada and Germany on September 10, 1939. The same day, the Patricias were mobilized for active service. The regiment recruited in Winnipeg and Vancouver until October. The regiment sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia on the December 21, 1939, arriving in Aldershot, England, as part of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.G. Colquhoun. They spent New Year&#x27;s Eve in Cove, west of Farnborough. On February 10, 1940, the colonel-in-chief, Princess Patricia, inspected her regiment for the first time in twenty-one years. The regiment spent three and a half years in United Kingdom, most of which was spent in coastal defence and training in various parts of the country.

On July 10, 1943, the PPCLI, forming part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and the British Eighth Army, landed in Sicily during Operation Husky. The Patricia won its first battle honours of the Second World War at Leonforte. Later, on September 4, 1943, the regiment landed and fought in Italy, advancing North for two months. The unit was slowed down by the demolished bridges and the German rear guard. In December 1943 the regiment fought during the Moro River Campaign; that year the soldiers spent Christmas in Ortona.

In May 1944, the PPCLI took part in the offensive against the Hitler Line, west of Monte Cassino, during the allied offensive against Rome. At that point, the regiment was a component of the newly formed I Canadian Corps. In August, the unit took part in the offensive against the Gothic Line and in the assaults on San Fortunato and Rimini.

On March 13, 1945, the I Canadian Corps was transferred to Northwest Europe where it joined the First Canadian Army and took part in the liberation of the Netherlands. Shortly after, the regiment captured the city of Apeldoorn, and, on May 7, 1945, it was the first allied force to enter Amsterdam, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Clark.

On June 1, 1945, a new battalion of the regiment was authorized to be part the Canadian Pacific Force in the campaign against Japan. Its official designation was 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, 2nd Canadian Infantry. After the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American atomic bombs and Japan&#x27;s subsequent surrender on August 15, 1945, the Pacific Force was disbanded. On September 2, the new battalion was renamed &quot;2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, Canadian Infantry Corps&quot; and became a component of the interim force, waiting for the formation of a permanent force.

In October 1945, the regiment&#x27;s serving battalion in Europe, understrength, returned to Winnipeg and was demobilized.

=== After the war (1945–1950) ===
After the war, in January 1946, while the interim force was gradually disbanded and the permanent force was formed, the 2nd Battalion returned to CFB Shilo. On June 10, it was relocated to Calgary, Alberta. On March 1, 1947, the battalion was renamed from &quot;2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, Canadian Infantry Corps&quot; to &quot;2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry&quot;.

In 1948, on the eve of the Korean War, an emphasis was put on the airborne troops and the 2nd Battalion was the first unit chosen to fill this role, on a voluntary basis. In the end, all the members of the unit, including the officers, became paratroopers; training was completed in the spring of 1949.

=== Korean War (1950–1954) ===
On August 15, 1950, the 2nd Battalion was created within the regiment to be a component of the Canadian Army Special Force in response to the North Korean invasion of South Korea; the unit adopted the designation of 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. The new battalion trained in Calgary and at CFB Wainwright, in Alberta, before boarding the USS &quot;Private Joe P. Martinez&quot; on November 25, 1950, to Pusan in South Korea. The battalion landed in Korea in December and trained in the mountains for eight weeks before finally taking part in the war on February 6, becoming a component of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade of the IX American Corps in the 8th US Army. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI was the first Canadian infantry unit to take part in the Korean War.

On April 22, 1951, Chinese forces undertook a major offensive against the United Nations forces and pierced through the first line of defence held by the ROK Army 6th Division. During the Battle of Kapyong the 2nd Battalion, PPCLI, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and A Company, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion (US) were tasked with the defence of the Kapyong Valley. The Australian and US units withdrew from the battlefield leaving the 700 men of 2 PPLCI on Hill 677 encircled and cut off from support. The 2 PPCLI held the position on Hill 677 in a last stand throughout the night of 25 April against the attacks of two PVA divisions consisting of 20,000 men. The delay of the Chinese forces for three days while United Nations forces withdrew to a new defensive line saved Seoul and prevented US forces in Korea, then in general retreat, from encirclement. For their action, these three units received the United States Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.

On May 25, 1951, the 2nd Battalion, PPCLI was transferred to the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade within the 1st Commonwealth Division. In the fall, the 2nd Battalion was replaced by 1 PPCLI and returned to Calgary. Meanwhile, in Canada, a new battalion was created on November 30, 1950. This 3rd Battalion trained at CFB Wainwright, CFB Borden, and Camp Ipperwash, before sending troops with the 1st and 2nd Battalions during their tour in Korea.

In October 1951, 2 PPCLI participated in Operation Commando, taking and holding a key position on the flanks of Hill 355. They repelled a counter-attack from a large force of Chinese PVA infantry on 12 October.

The 3rd Battalion replaced the 1st Battalion in the fall of 1952, and occupied Hill 355 until late November 1952. After three months of active service the battalion was disbanded on February 8, 1954. The PPCLI was again reduced to two battalions, and the commander, regimental sergeant major, and members of the disbanded 3rd Battalion were chosen to form the new 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Guards.

=== Service in Canada and Germany (1950–1988) ===
In the spring of 1950, the 1st Battalion supported civil authorities responding to floods in Manitoba.

From 1950 to 1969, Canada, as a NATO member, maintained a brigade-group in Germany. The 2nd Battalion, PPCLI served in Germany from October 1953 to the fall of 1955, when the 1st Battalion replaced it until the fall of 1957. In the fall of 1963 the 1st Battalion deployed for its second rotation until 1966. The 2nd Battalion returned in July 1984 for four years. In 1994 CFB Lahr in Germany closed, effectively ending the Canadian rotations.

=== Cold War and peacekeeping (1968–2003) ===

The 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry was sent to Cyprus in 1968 within the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFYCIP). Different infantry units including the two PPCLI battalions then undertook six-month rotations in the country until 1993. PPCLI completed 12 tours in Cyprus.

In 1970, the 1st Battalion of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada was based in Victoria, British Columbia. Due to a reorganization, its members were rebadged to the newly recreated 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. The regiment also increased in size when the Canadian government closed 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group.

The sculpture &quot;Anti-Tank Patrol&quot; by André Gauthier was commissioned to mark the 75th anniversary of the regiment in 1989.

The Patricias served in Israel, Golan, Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Nigeria, Uganda, Congo, Vietnam, Central America, Angola, Somalia, Rwanda, Korea, Croatia, and Bosnia, for various missions.

During the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, soldiers from PPCLI served in the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the United Nations peacekeeping force in Croatia. In the autumn of 1992, The 3rd Battalion replaced the Royal 22nd Regiment in Sector North, stationed out of Camp Polom, near Pakrac. The 22nd had actually spent much of their six-month tour out of position. They were with General Lewis MacKenzie, securing the Sarajevo airport for UN relief shipments. It was replaced by a battle group of 875 members mostly from the 2nd Battalion PPCLI in 1993. The battle group was dispatched to the Medak Pocket in September 1993 to interpose themselves between Serb and Croatian forces. After the Croatians opened fire on the PPCLI troops, they became involved in an intense firefight. In 2002, Colonel Jim Calvin and his men were awarded the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation for their bravery. A battle group drawn mostly from 1st Battalion PPCLI replaced the 2nd in 1994; the 2nd Battalion also served with the stabilization force in 1997, 2000 and 2003, the 3rd Battalion in 2000, and the 1st Battalion in 2002 and 2003. B Company, 1st Battalion, deployed as part of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians) Battle Group to northwest Bosnia from July 1997 to January 1998. Elements of PPCLI served with Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse during the 1917–1918 winter, and in 1999, the 1st Battalion sent a complete battle group to the Kosovo Force.In the spring of 1997, the 1st Battalion supported civil authorities with the Manitoba floods yet again. In 1998, it was again mobilized, this time to respond to the 1998 North American ice storm in Quebec.

To celebrate the announcement of the re-opening of Canada House in 1998, a detachment of the 3rd Battalion was sent to London to mount the Royal Guard at the Buckingham Palace, a rare honour. The Royal Canadian Regiment had the same honour two years later, at the re-opening.

=== War in Afghanistan (2001–2010) ===
==== Operation Apollo (2002–2003) ====
On January 22, 2002, during Operation Apollo, the Canadian contribution to Operation Enduring Freedom and the War in Afghanistan, the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, deployed to Afghanistan. The battle group also included a reconnaissance squadron from Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse and support elements from the 1 Service Battalion. These were the first major troops Canada sent in the theatre of operations, only preceded by a small team of Joint Task Force 2 operators in late 2001.

In March 2002, during Operation Anaconda, members of the 3PPCLI were in the Afghan province of Paktiya, clearing the mountains looking for Taliban and members of Al-Qaeda. The Canadian element of the operation, led by the United States, was composed of sixteen soldiers including six snipers. This sniper team, led by Master-Corporal Graham Ragsdale, registered more than 20 kills while Master-Corporal Arron Perry set the new world record for farthest combat kill with a .50 calibre McMillan Tac-50 sniper rifle that killed a Taliban fighter at a distance of . Later on in the mission, Corporal Rob Furlong set yet a new record by firing a shot from a McMillan Tac-50 that killed a Taliban fighter at a distance of . Both shots surpassed the long-standing previous world record of set by U.S. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock during the Vietnam War. The U.S. Army awarded the team members the Bronze Star for their actions in combat. Other Canadian snipers recorded high hit ratios and some extremely difficult shots, but remain anonymous.On March 13, 2002, Operation Harpoon was launched in parallel of Operation Anaconda, with the goal of eliminating a small pocket of Taliban fighters. The operation involved air elements as well as a ground battlegroup composed of Canadian and American soldiers, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Pat Stogran, commander 3PPCLI battlegroup. The next day, a reconnaissance platoon from 3PPCLI led the American troops to a network of caves and bunkers used by Al-Qaeda resisters. The battlegroup proceeded to destroy the bunkers and Operation Harpoon ended on March 19.

After Operation Harpoon, the 3PPCLI returned to Kandahar International Airport, and started training for future operations. On April 18, 2002, the 3rd Battalion was involved in a highly publicized case of friendly-fire (&quot;blue on blue&quot;). The Canadian soldiers were participating in planned nighttime training exercises near Kandahar when Major Harry Schmidt, an American pilot from the Illinois Air National Guard, flew overhead. Believing he was being fired upon by enemy soldiers, Schmidt dropped one laser-guided bomb on the soldiers from his F-16. Sergeant Marc Léger, Corporal Ainsworth Dyer, Private Richard Green and Private Nathan Smith were killed instantly and eight were injured. Schmidt was court-martialed by the U.S. and convicted of dereliction of duty as a result, in what became known as the Tarnak Farm incident.On May 4, 2002, Operation Torii is launched, and Lieutenant-Colonel Stogran leads an international task force, of which 400 Canadian soldiers. The goal of the mission was to discover networks of caves used by the Talibans and Al-Qaeda, as well as to gather intelligence in the Tora Bora region.

From June 30 to July 4, 2002, the majority of 3PPCLI relocated to Zabul Province, Northwest of Kandahar, to establish for the first time a coalition presence in the region.

The 3rd Battalion started preparing its redeployment back to Canada on July 13, and its members came back home in two contingents, on July 28 and July 30, after a short stay in Guam. In March 2003, the 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, deployed a 35-soldier platoon to serve alongside already deployed units from Operation Apollo. The platoon was replaced in July by a Royal Canadian Horse Artillery platoon.

==== Operation Athena (2004–2010) ====

From August 2004 to February 2005, during Operation Athena, the 3rd Battalion deployed a reconnaissance platoon with the LdSH (RC) reconnaissance squadron to Kabul. A battlegroup built on 1PPCLI deployed in Kandahar from February to July 2006.

When the 1PPCLI deployed to Afghanistan, the Taliban began a major offensive and the Canadians were caught in the middle. After a spring in which a record number of attacks against Canadian soldiers had been set, and numerous offensives by Canadians which included six deaths to the Canadian Forces, the Taliban in Kandahar and Helmand provinces were massing and Operation Mountain Thrust was launched in the beginning of the summer. Canadians were the leading combatants and the first fighting in the Battle of Panjwaii took place. Complex mud-walled compounds made the rural Panjwaii district take on an urban style of fighting in some places. Daily firefights, artillery bombardments, and allied airstrikes turned the tides of the battle in favour of the Canadians.After Operation Mountain Thrust came to an end, Taliban fighters flooded back into the Panjwaii district in numbers that had not been seen yet in a single area in the post Anaconda war. The Canadian Forces, which came under NATO command at the end of July, launched Operation Medusa in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters once and for all.

The fighting of Operation Medusa was conducted with a larger force of Canadians, most of them being brand new to combat and largely fought by the rotation replacing the 1PPCLI, a battle group built around the 1st Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR).

For their actions in 2006, the 1st Battalion PPCLI Battle Group was given the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation from the Governor-General of Canada.

The 2nd Battalion, PPCLI, took over from the 3rd Battalion, Royal 22e Régiment (R22eR) in February 2008. In August of the same year, it is replaced by the 3RCR, and in September 2009, 1PPCLI returns in Afghanistan to replace 2R22eR, where it stayed until May 2010.

== Battle Honours ==
Battle honours are the right given by the Canadian Crown to the regiment to mark on its colours the name of the battles or operations in which they stood out. Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry has received 41 battle honours. Battle honours in all caps were awarded for participation in large operations and campaigns, while those in lowercase indicate honours granted for more specific battles. Those battle honours in bold type are authorized for emblazonment on the regimental colours. Two soldiers of the regiment have been awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest honours of the Commonwealth forces, during World War I.

Battle honours:

==Recognition==
*Freedom of the city was exercised by the 3rd Battalion in Victoria, British Columbia on June 15, 1974.
*The regiment was granted the Freedom of the City of Edmonton, an honour in respect of the centennial of the regiment. This permits the regiment to conduct parades on city streets as of May 22, 2014.

=== Bands ===

Instead of a regimental band, PPCLI maintains three drum lines that form the regimental corps of drums, which provides ceremonial musical support. It is the Canadian counterpart to the Corps of Drums of the British Army Royal Logistics Corps, and thus it is an all-percussion unit that occasionally marches with the Royal Canadian Artillery Band. From 1919 to 1994 however, PPCLI did maintain a regimental band. PPCLI&#x27;s band date back to the First World War when its core band came from the St. Mary&#x27;s Boys Brigade Band and the 140th New Brunswick Battalion in January 1916. PPCLI Band was formed in 1919 under the guidance of Captain Tommy James and was stationed at Fort Osborne Barracks in Winnipeg. In early 1940s, the 1st Canadian Division Band was largely made up of former PPCLI bandsmen, which provided the basis to be reactivated after the war at Wainwright, Alberta. Due to military budget cuts in 1994, the entire band was disbanded and reduced to a corps of drums. The drum line was inactive due to the Afghanistan War in the early 2000s; however, it was re-formed under the leadership of Sergeant Keith Mooney and Warrant Officer Dave Kennedy in 2014. The process for establishment began in 2012 with the research for drum patterns and sequences. The drum line took part in the regimental Centennial Parade in September 2014.

The Edmonton Police Service pipe band, which was formed in 1914, was dissolved during the First World War, with its musicians being re-augmented to PPCLI and leading the regiment into battle. Members of the pipe band also served as stretcher bearers during the war. As a result of this close history together, the Pipes and Drums of the EPS, which was re-founded in 1961, is the only non-military civilian band within the Commonwealth to wear the badges of three Canadian regiments, with one of these being PPCLI. While serving as a public relations tool for the EPS, it performs alongside the regiment during public events in Edmonton. The band was invited to play at PPCLI&#x27;s beating retreat ceremony in 1964 and at the regimental trooping the colour in 1967.

== Traditions ==

Since March 17, 2007, the regiment&#x27;s colonel-in-chief is former Governor-General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson. The previous colonel-in-chief was Countess Mountbatten of Burma, herself succeeding Princess Patricia. This is the first time that a person who is not a member of the Canadian Royal Family has been invited to take such a position with the regiment. The new colonel-in-chief took up her appointment at a ceremony on March 17, 2007, at the Regimental Headquarters in Edmonton.

The PPCLI does not have an official motto; however, their unofficial motto, &quot;First In The Field&quot;, is based on the fact that they were the first Canadian unit to deploy in the Great War. The regiment also uses another non-official motto, &quot;Once a Patricia, Always a Patricia&quot;, which reminds that the regimental family includes retired soldiers and officers and those who transferred elsewhere in the Canadian Forces. March 17 is the most important date within the regiment, as it corresponds to Princess Patricia&#x27;s birthday. May 8 is the anniversary of the 1915 Battle of Frezenberg and is observed by a parade and a church ceremony. April 25 is the anniversary of the Battle of Kapyong, normally observed by the 2nd Battalion with a parade. On August 10, the regiment celebrates the foundation of the PPCLI in 1914. September 21 is the anniversary of the Battle of San Fortunato in 1944.

The regimental march of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry consists of the songs &quot;Has Anyone Seen The Colonel?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way To Tipperary&quot;, and &quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot;.

== &quot;The Patrician&quot; ==
&quot;The Patrician&quot; is a regimental journal first published in May 1933. In 1946, a monthly paper started publishing, but was suspended during the Korean War. In 1953, &quot;The Patrician&quot; started publishing twice annually until 1960 when it became annual because of financial restraints. &quot;The Patrician&quot; adopted its present format in 2003.

== Ric-A-Dam-Doo == 
&quot;Ric-A-Dam-Doo&quot; is a nickname for the original camp flag of the PPCLI. Various sources claim that &quot;Ric-A-Dam-Doo&quot; is presumably an anglicization of the Scottish Gaelic for &quot;cloth of thy mother&quot;; but it is not clear that this claim has been confirmed by a Gaelic speaker. The independent companies that preceded the formation of the 42nd Regiment of Foot were known in Scottish Gaelic as , which translates to &quot;The Black Watch&quot; in English.

In 1984, in a conversation with the PPCLI Colonel-of-The-Regiment, Colonel William Sutherland, Lieutenant James MacInnis surmised that the PPCLI&#x27;s founder, Brigadier Hamilton Gault, a former Black Watch officer from the Canadian Militia, may have used the Gaelic term when referring to the flag and Lieutenant MacInnis believed that subsequent soldiers&#x27; bastardization of the Gaelic phrase became accepted practice. MacInnis&#x27;s knowledge came from his own family history. An ancestor, Donald Livingston, son of Anna MacInnis rescued the of the Appin Regiment after their defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Today, the Appin Regiment Colour is displayed in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. The Ric-A-Dam-Doo was hand-sewn by Princess Patricia and presented to the regiment.

In 2011, Colonel-in-Chief Adrienne Clarkson asked Bryan Adams to write a song to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the PPCLI. Together with his songwriting partner Jim Vallance, they composed the song &quot;Ric-A-Dam-Doo&quot;. It was recorded by the wives of the regiment in Edmonton, Alberta, and was released to the public by Universal Records.

== Western Hockey League affiliation ==
The PPCLI is not directly affiliated with the Western Hockey League, but they are associated through name with the Regina Pats who were formed in 1917 in Regina, Saskatchewan, as a major junior hockey team. The &quot;Patricias&quot; shortened their name to the Regina &quot;Pats&quot; in 1923, and to this day wear the PPCLI patch on their hockey jersey&#x27;s shoulders. The Regina Pats are the longest lived major junior hockey team in the world.

== In popular culture ==
In the movie &quot;Across the Pacific&quot;(1942), a cashiered U.S. Army officer, played by Humphrey Bogart crosses the border in 1941 and attempts to enlist in the Princess Pats. He is refused, as the regiment expects all its officers to have high moral standards. The character later comments that his rejection &quot;was a *little* on the insulting side&quot;.

A soldier of the regiment is interviewed in Max Brooks&#x27;s zombie novel &quot;World War Z.&quot;

The character Major Patrick Gordon/Patrick Crawley in Season 2 of Downton Abbey was a member of PPCLI.

The Canadian infantry soldiers in the Afghanistan War-based movie Hyena Road are members of the PPCLI.

In 1968 movie &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, Sgt. Patrick O&#x27;Neill (played by Jeremy Slate) is wearing P.P.C.L.I. insignia on his shoulder.

In the &quot;Ultimate Soldier Challenge&quot; TV show on History Channel (Season 1, Episode 5), three teams of two soldiers (US Marines, Canadians, and Contractors) are competing in various military tasks. The Canadians (Alex and Andrija) are from the PPCLI.

==Freedoms==
The regiment has received the Freedom of several locations throughout its history; these include:

* 1952: Calgary

* 16 September 1972: Esquimalt.
* 15 June 1974: Victoria.
* 1985: Ypres
* 1985: Ottawa.
* 1989: Winnipeg.
* 2011: Kapyong
* 22 May 2012: Brandon.
* 10 August 2014: Edmonton.
* 15 September 2014: Gibbons.

==Arms==
== Order of precedence ==


==Possible specialist Arctic sovereignty role==
It has been suggested in a Canadian professional military journal that the regiment&#x27;s third battalion (3 PPCLI) could be adapted to become a specialized light infantry battalion that is able to deploy parachute infantry and marine infantry company groups to support the protection of Canada&#x27;s sovereignty in the Arctic.

<text>The Stillwater River is a tributary of the Great Miami River in western Ohio in the United States. Via the Great Miami and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

It rises near the Indiana state line, in western Darke County, approximately northwest of Greenville. It flows east-southeast and is joined by Greenville Creek in Covington, approximately west of Piqua. It flows south past Covington and Englewood, where it is dammed for flood control, then southeast to join the Great Miami River in Dayton.

Stillwater River was so named on account of its relatively slow current. The Stillwater River was one of the Great Miami River tributaries that flooded during the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, resulting in the creation of the Miami Conservancy District.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Stillwater River has also been known as:
* Jacobs Lateral 
* Southwest Branch 
* Stillwater Creek
